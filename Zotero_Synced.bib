  abstract = {A new, more accurate and considerably simpler version of the Perez[1] diffuse irradiance model is presented. This model is one of those used currently to estimate short time step (hourly or less) irradiance on tilted planes based on global and direct (or diffuse) irradiance. It has been shown to perform more accurately than other models for a large number of locations worldwide. The key assumptions defining the model remain basically unchanged. These include (1) a description of the sky dome featuring a circumsolar zone and horizon zone superimposed over an isotropic background, and (2) a parameterization of insolation conditions (based on available inputs to the model), determining the value of the radiant power originating from these two zones. Operational modifications performed on the model are presented in a step by step approach. Each change is justified on the basis of increased ease of use and/or overall accuracy. Two years of hourly data on tilted planes from two climatically distinct sites in France are used to verify performance accuracy. The isotropic, Hay and Klucher models are used as reference. Major changes include (1) the simplification of the governing equation by use of reduced brightness coefficients; (2) the allowance for negative coefficients; (3) reduction of the horizon band to an arc-of-great-circle; (4) optimization of the circumsolar region width; and (5) optimization of insolation conditions parameterization.},

In this paper, the Bayesian approach to regularization and model-comparison is demonstrated by studying the inference problem of interpolating noisy data. The concepts and methods described are quite general and can be applied to many other data modeling problems. Regularizing constants are set by examining their posterior probability distribution. Alternative regularizers (priors) and alternative basis sets are objectively compared by evaluating the evidence for them. ``Occam's razor'' is automatically embodied by this process. The way in which Bayes infers the values of regularizing constants and noise levels has an elegant interpretation in terms of the effective number of parameters determined by the data set. This framework is due to Gull and Skilling.},

  abstract = {Over the years, the growing penetration of renewable energy into the electricity market has resulted in a significant change in the electricity market price. This change makes the existing forecasting method prone to error, decreasing the economic benefits. Hence, more precise forecasting methods need to be developed. This paper starts with a survey and benchmark of existing machine learning approaches for forecasting the real-time market (RTM) price. While these methods provide sufficient modeling capability via supervised learning, their accuracy is still limited due to the single data source, e.g., historical price information only. In this paper, a novel twostage supervised learning approach is proposed by diversifying the data sources such as highly correlated power data. This idea is inspired by the recent load forecasting methods that have shown extremely well performances. Specifically, the proposed two-stage method, namely the rerouted method, learns two types of mapping rules. The first one is the mapping between the historical wind power and the historical price. The second is the forecasting rule for wind generation. Based on the two rules, we forecast the price via the forecasted generation and the first learned mapping between power and price. Additionally, we observed that it is not the more training data the better, leading to our validation steps to quantify the best training intervals for different datasets. We conduct comparisons of numerical results between existing methods and the proposed methods based on datasets from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). For each machine learning step, we examine different learning methods, such as polynomial regression, support vector regression, neural network, and deep neural network. The results show that the proposed method is significantly better than existing approaches when renewables are involved.},

However, the LSTM algorithm still has certain limitations, e.g., the accuracy of forecasting the building air conditioning power consumption was not very high. To explore ways of improving the prediction accuracy, this study selects a high-rise office building in Shanghai to predict the air conditioning power consumption and lighting power consumption, respectively and discusses the influence of weather parameters and schedule parameters on the prediction accuracy. The results demonstrate that using the LSTM algorithm to accurately predict the electricity consumption of air conditioners is more challenging than predicting lighting electricity consumption. To improve the prediction accuracy of air conditioning power consumption, two parameters, relative humidity, and scheduling, must be added to the prediction model.},

However, most of the existing projections are based on rising air temperatures alone, ignoring that rising temperatures are associated with increased humidity; a lethal combination that could significantly increase morbidity and mortality rates during extreme heat events. We bridge this gap by identifying the key measures of heat stress, considering both air temperature and near-surface humidity, in characterizing the climate sensitivity of electricity demand at a national scale. Here we show that in many of the high energy consuming states, such as California and Texas, projections based on air temperature alone underestimates cooling demand by as much as 10--15\% under both present and future climate scenarios. Our results establish that air temperature is a necessary but not sufficient variable for adequately characterizing the climate sensitivity of cooling load, and that near-surface humidity plays an equally important role.},

  abstract = {What is ML Observability?  ML Observability is the practice of obtaining a deep understanding of a model's  performance across all stages of the model development cycle: as it's being built,  once it's been deployed, and long into its life in production. In practice, ML observability is often the key difference between a team that flies  blind after deploying a model and a team that can iterate and improve on their  models quickly.  Is Model Observability just a fancy word for ML monitoring? Model observability begins with the process of collecting model evaluations  in environments such as training, validation, and production, then tying them  together with analytics that allows one to connect these points to solve ML  engineering problems. These inferences are stored in a model evaluation store  (credit to Josh Tobin for this term), which hosts the raw inference data.   An evaluation store holds the response of the model, a signature of the model  decisions, to every piece of input data for every model version, in   every environment. An ML observability platform allows teams to analyze model degradation and  to root cause any issues that arise. This ability to diagnose the root cause of a  model's issues, by connecting points across validation and production, is what  differentiates model observability from traditional model monitoring. While  model monitoring consists of setting up alerts on key model performance  metrics such as accuracy, or drift, model observability implies a higher objective  of getting to the bottom of any regressions in performance or anomalous  behavior. We are interested in the why. Monitoring is interested in only  aggregates and alerts. Observability is interested in what we can infer from the  model's predictions, explainability insights, the production feature data, and  the training data, to understand the cause behind model actions and build  workflows to improve},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic and wind power forecasts in power systems with a high share of renewable energy are essential in several applications. These include stable grid operation, profitable power trading, and forward-looking system planning. However, there is a lack of publicly available datasets for research on machine learning based prediction methods. This paper provides an openly accessible time series dataset with realistic synthetic power data. Other publicly and non-publicly available datasets often lack precise geographic coordinates, timestamps, or static power plant information, e.g., to protect business secrets. On the opposite, this dataset provides these. The dataset comprises 120 photovoltaic and 273 wind power plants with distinct sides all over Germany from 500 days in hourly resolution. This large number of available sides allows forecasting experiments to include spatial correlations and run experiments in transfer and multi-task learning. It includes side-specific, power source-dependent, non-synthetic input features from the ICON-EU weather model. A simulation of virtual power plants with physical models and actual meteorological measurements provides realistic synthetic power measurement time series. These time series correspond to the power output of virtual power plants at the location of the respective weather measurements. Since the synthetic time series are based exclusively on weather measurements, possible errors in the weather forecast are comparable to those in actual power data. In addition to the data description, we evaluate the quality of weather-prediction-based power forecasts by comparing simplified physical models and a machine learning model. This experiment shows that forecasts errors on the synthetic power data are comparable to real-world historical power measurements.},

The operation of these storage facilities can be optimized using automated energy management systems. This work presents a Reinforcement Learning-based energy management approach in the context of CO2-neutral hydrogen production and storage for an industrial combined heat and power application. The economic performance of the presented approach is compared to a rule-based energy management strategy as a lower benchmark and a Dynamic Programming-based unit commitment as an upper benchmark. The comparative analysis highlights both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the implemented Reinforcement Learning approach. The simulation results indicate a promising potential of Rein\- forcement Learning-based algorithms for hydrogen production planning, outperforming the lower benchmark. Furthermore, a novel approach in the scientific literature demonstrates that including energy and price forecasts in the Reinforcement Learning observation space significantly improves optimization results and allows the al\- gorithm to take variable prices into account. An unresolved challenge, however, is balancing multiple conflicting objectives in a setting with few degrees of freedom. As a result, no parameterization of the reward function could be found that fully satisfied all predefined targets, highlighting one of the major challenges for Reinforcement Learning -based energy management algorithms to overcome.},

A mathematical PV performance model taking into account the important effects and losses and an economic cost model were developed and presented in detail. The objective function is the internal rate of return and the optimization is performed by a genetic algorithm. The results show that the proposed models and method are capable to optimize the grid-connected PV plant and provide reliable results after a 6--7~min calculation time. The method was demonstrated in detail for a Hungarian location, including the losses and cost structure of the optimal plant configuration. The optimization was also performed for 5 additional sites around the world to assess the effect of location and meteorology. The impact of the decreasing PV module prices on the optimal design is calculated to identify the expected future trends in PV plant design. The presented optimization method can be utilized to facilitate the optimal design of commercial PV plants and for research purposes.},

Normalized root mean square difference and normalized mean bias difference statistics are formed to quantify the ability of each model to estimate the utilizable energy on a tilted surface. The influence of horizontal diffuse radiation on tilted surface model performance is examined by comparing the predicted utilizable energy on a tilted surface using both measured horizontal diffuse and estimated horizontal diffuse found from diffuse fraction correlations. On an overall basis, the isotropic sky model showed the poorest performance and is not recommended for estimating the hourly radiation on a tilted surface. The anisotropic models have comparable performance to each other.

  abstract = {For design and simulation of solar energy systems, quality information about all components of solar irradiance is crucial. In cases when only global irradiance measurements are available, separation models are a useful method to estimate DNI and diffuse irradiation. Several of such models have been developed since the 1960s, most of them aiming to deliver estimates in hourly resolution. For higher data resolution, such as in minute data, those models are not able to describe fast transient and cloud enhancement phenomena commonly observed in data with smaller time-steps. This paper proposes an adaptation of the BRL separation model, making it capable of delivering more precise irradiance estimates for higher resolution data. Two models result from this adaptation: one for Brazil and other for Australia. The proposed models yield a more precise DNI and diffuse fraction estimates to their respective countries, compared to other separation models commonly used in the technical literature. For example, using the recommended Combined Performance Index (CPI) as a single statistical indicator, the proposed model yields DNI estimates with CPI from 230 to 350\% for Australia, and from 270 to 800\% for Brazil, while the Engerer model, recently recommended as a ``quasi-universal'' 1-min separation model, yields DNI estimates with CPI from 500 to 700\% for Australia, and from 600 to 1800\% for Brazil.},

  abstract = {Real-time photovoltaic (PV) generation information is crucial for distribution system operations such as switching, state-estimation, and voltage management. However, most behind-the-meter solar installations are not monitored. Typically, the only information available to the distribution system operator is the installed capacity of solar behind each meter; though in some cases even the presence of solar may be unknown. We present a method for disaggreagating behind-the-meter solar generation using only information that is already available in most distribution systems: advanced metering infrastructure, substation monitoring, and generation monitoring at a few PV systems nearby the circuit. The proposed method accurately predicts which homes have solar in over 90\% of cases, and recovers the 15-min resolution PV generation signals with root mean square errors between 20\% and 50\% of average daily PV generation both historically and real-time. A sensitivity analysis shows the method to be robust to the number of buildings and time span of data used to fit. However including more than 3 solar proxies can cause false positive of PV systems behind meters. We find that the proposed method performs better at homes that export electricity to the grid more often.},

  abstract = {Transposition models convert the solar irradiance received on a horizontal surface to in-plane irradiance. All transposition models to date, unfortunately, only produce deterministic (as oppose to probabilistic) estimates. In modern energy meteorology, having the entire predictive distribution is more desirable than relying only on deterministic estimates. To that end, this paper outlines two strategies for creating probabilistic transposition models (PTMs), that can quantify the various types of uncertainty involved in the modeling process. The first strategy seeks the analytic expressions of measurement, model, and parameter uncertainty, and the final predictive variance is the sum of these three types of uncertainty. On the other hand, the second strategy directly models the overall uncertainty as a whole, and uses ensemble model output statistics to estimate the predictive distribution through optimizing a loss function. Both strategies generate estimates of tilted irradiance with Gaussian predictive distributions. As compared to their deterministic counterparts, PTMs clearly offer more insights on uncertainty quantification, during solar energy system design, simulation, performance evaluation, and power output forecasting.},

Hence, it is important to be able to predict the output power of a PV system. Being able to do so would help plant managers to effectively manage the supply of energy to meet the demand. In this study a photovoltaic system model composed of a PV array model, a DC cable model, and an inverter model was developed, and was used in conjunction with an irradiance forecasting algorithm to predict the output power of a 1 kW grid-connected photovoltaic system. A total of three system models were evaluated, each differing in the inverter model used. When using measured irradiance as input to the system models, the best model obtained a root mean square error (RMSE) of 32.957 W and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.978. When using predicted irradiance as input to the system models, the best model obtained an RMSE ofllS.041 W and an R2 of 0.710.},

This paper examines efficiency measurements for a wide range of different inverter products at multiple power levels and input voltages. A model is developed that expresses efficiency as a function of both power and voltage, and it is demonstrated that this model can approximate the efficiency with an appropriate level of accuracy using a small number of parameters.

  abstract = {Accurately computing solar irradiance on external facades is a prerequisite for reliably predicting thermal behavior and cooling loads of buildings. Validation of radiation models and algorithms implemented in building energy simulation codes is an essential endeavor for evaluating solar gain models. Seven solar radiation models implemented in four building energy simulation codes were investigated: (1) isotropic sky, (2) Klucher, (3) Hay--Davies, (4) Reindl, (5) Muneer, (6) 1987 Perez, and (7) 1990 Perez models. The building energy simulation codes included: EnergyPlus, DOE-2.1E, TRNSYS-TUD, and ESP-r. Solar radiation data from two 25 days periods in October and March/April, which included diverse atmospheric conditions and solar altitudes, measured on the EMPA campus in a suburban area in Duebendorf, Switzerland, were used for validation purposes. Two of the three measured components of solar irradiances -- global horizontal, diffuse horizontal and direct-normal -- were used as inputs for calculating global irradiance on a south-west fa{\c c}ade. Numerous statistical parameters were employed to analyze hourly measured and predicted global vertical irradiances. Mean absolute differences for both periods were found to be: (1) 13.7\% and 14.9\% for the isotropic sky model, (2) 9.1\% for the Hay--Davies model, (3) 9.4\% for the Reindl model, (4) 7.6\% for the Muneer model, (5) 13.2\% for the Klucher model, (6) 9.0\%, 7.7\%, 6.6\%, and 7.1\% for the 1990 Perez models, and (7) 7.9\% for the 1987 Perez model. Detailed sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo and fitted effects for N-way factorial analyses were applied to assess how uncertainties in input parameters propagated through one of the building energy simulation codes and impacted the output parameter. The implications of deviations in computed solar irradiances on predicted thermal behavior and cooling load of buildings are discussed.},

Consequently, the prediction of power produced from these plants is fundamental for the reliability, safety and stability of the grid. This paper compares three physical models describing the PV cell (corresponding to three-, four- and five-parameter equivalent electric circuit) and two thermal models for the cell temperature estimation (NOCT and Sandia). The models were calibrated and tested towards ten monocrystalline and eight polycrystalline modules installed at SolarTechLab at Politecnico di Milano. The hourly error of the forecasted power output is usually lower than 15Wh, while NMAE\% and WMAE\% are in the range of 0.5\% and 10\%. Low errors, calculated with actual weather conditions, suggest that the implemented models are accurate, but they cannot be directly compared with other approaches which adopt weather forecasts. Results show that there is no clear advantage of using complex models, but the data used for the model calibration mostly affect the model accuracy. It was found that forecasted power output are more accurate using experimental data and Sandia's thermal model in monocrystalline cells type, while for the polycrystalline the data from the manufacturer and NOCT have lower errors.},

This paper explores whether these deep models should be a recommended option for tabular data by rigorously comparing the new deep models to XGBoost on various datasets. In addition to systematically comparing their performance, we consider the tuning and computation they require. Our study shows that XGBoost outperforms these deep models across the datasets, including the datasets used in the papers that proposed the deep models. We also demonstrate that XGBoost requires much less tuning. On the positive side, we show that an ensemble of deep models and XGBoost performs better on these datasets than XGBoost alone.},

We consider attenuation caused by both atmospheric PM and PM deposition on panels (soiling) in calculating the overall effect of PM on PV generation, and include precipitation removal of soiling and the benefits of panel cleaning. Our results reveal that, with no cleaning and precipitation-only removal, PV generation in heavily polluted and desert regions is reduced by more than 50\% by PM, with soiling accounting for more than two-thirds of the total reduction. Our findings highlight the benefit of cleaning panels in heavily polluted regions with low precipitation and the potential to increase PV generation through air-quality improvements.},

In this paper, we address this problem for non-stationary time series, which is very challenging yet crucially important. We introduce the STRIPE model for representing structured diversity based on shape and time features, ensuring both probable predictions while being sharp and accurate. STRIPE is agnostic to the forecasting model, and we equip it with a diversification mechanism relying on determinantal point processes (DPP). We introduce two DPP kernels for modeling diverse trajectories in terms of shape and time, which are both differentiable and proved to be positive semi-definite. To have an explicit control on the diversity structure, we also design an iterative sampling mechanism to disentangle shape and time representations in the latent space. Experiments carried out on synthetic datasets show that STRIPE significantly outperforms baseline methods for representing diversity, while maintaining accuracy of the forecasting model. We also highlight the relevance of the iterative sampling scheme and the importance to use different criteria for measuring quality and diversity. Finally, experiments on real datasets illustrate that STRIPE is able to outperform state-ofthe-art probabilistic forecasting approaches in the best sample prediction.},

  abstract = {A key aspect for achieving a high-accuracy Photovoltaic (PV) power simulation, and reliable digital twins, is a detailed description of the PV system itself. However, such information is not always accurate, complete, or even available. This work presents a novel approach to learn features of unknown PV systems or subsystems using genetic algorithm optimization. Based on measured PV power, this approach learns and optimizes seven PV system parameters: nominal power, tilt and azimuth angles, albedo, irradiance and temperature dependency, and the ratio of nominal module to nominal inverter power (DC/AC ratio). By optimizing these parameters, we create a digital twin that accurately reflects the actual properties and behaviors of the unknown PV systems or subsystems. To develop this approach, on-site measured power, ambient temperature, and satellite-derived irradiance of a PV system located in south-west Germany are used. The approach proposed here achieves a mean bias error of about 10\% for nominal power, 3{\textopenbullet} for azimuth and tilt angles, between 0.01\%/C and 0.09\%/C for temperature coefficient, and now-casts with an accuracy of around 6\%. In summary, we present a new solution to parametrize and simulate PV systems accurately with limited or no previous knowledge of their properties and features.},

However, most of these algorithms are designed in-vitro and usually not very resilient against the failure behaviour of real-world systems, that is, minor system faults (e.g. a failing sensor, small damage, or firmware updates). In most scenarios, such a minor fault leads to a total failure of the detection engine, resulting either in the constant reporting of an anomaly or a total inability for further detection. In this article we investigate this problem in more detail and present simple approaches to circumvent them.},

However, physical interpretation of these models remains a challenge due to their opaque nature. This paper outlines an experiment to unveil analytical expressions from an open-source machine-learning-based algorithm, i.e., symbolic regression. From 241 residential buildings in the Netherlands, 50 unique analytical expressions were produced demonstrating overall better characterization accuracies than an XGBoost baseline, while providing a powerful mean of interpretability from model structures and coefficients. These insights present a starting point for further work towards highly scalable models yielding new characterizations of residential buildings.},

  abstract = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

  abstract = {Energy storage is ubiquitous in industrial processes and comes in many forms such as material, chemical, electromechanical buffers. System identification of such energy buffers demands proper estimation/prediction of their physical quantities and unknown parameters. Once these parameters are determined, the identified model can be employed to predict the industrial process dynamics, which finally assist to build efficient control for these processes. This paper proposes physics-informed neural networks-based grey-box modeling methods for the identification of energy buffers. The underlying system dynamics are enforced on the neural network structure to ensure that the identified grey-box model follows the approximate physics. We define two novel grey-box models based on simple and recurrent neural network architectures and test these models for a generic energy buffer. Performance and training time for the proposed grey-box models are compared against a black-box baseline model. Results confirm that imposing the dynamic system's physics on the network improves the performance, and utilizing a recurrent architecture leads to a further improvement.},

Physics-informed neural networks require substantially less training data and can result in simpler neural network structures, while achieving high accuracy. This work unlocks a range of opportunities in power systems, being able to determine dynamic states, such as rotor angles and frequency, and uncertain parameters such as inertia and damping at a fraction of the computational time required by conventional methods. This paper focuses on introducing the framework and showcases its potential using a single-machine infinite bus system as a guiding example. Physics-informed neural networks are shown to accurately determine rotor angle and frequency up to 87 times faster than conventional methods.},

In these algorithms, each agent performs local computation based on its own information and information received from its neighboring agents through the underlying communication network, so that the optimization problem can be solved in a distributed manner. This survey paper aims to offer a detailed overview of existing distributed optimization algorithms and their applications in power systems. More specifically, we first review discrete-time and continuous-time distributed optimization algorithms for undirected graphs. We then discuss how to extend these algorithms in various directions to handle more realistic scenarios.

  abstract = {Data science models, although successful in a number of commercial domains, have had limited applicability in scientific problems involving complex physical phenomena. Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigm that aims to leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving the effectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. The overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an essential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producing scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific understanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm of TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper, we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of research themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domain knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from different disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.},

The main goal is to determine the optimal parameter values of the implemented model which are: series resistance, reverse saturation current, photocurrent, ideality factor and shunt resistance in case of the five parameters model. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet is developed in order to perform modeling and analysis of the parameters analytical initial values using manufacturer datasheet specifications regarding to the changing in solar irradiance and ambient temperature. Then, the sum of the squared residuals between in-field measured and simulated data are calculated and minimized using Excel solver in order to obtain the optimal values of the parameters simultaneously, to describe the best fit for the outdoor measured data. The proposed approach is used to find the optimal parameters of the PV module TRINA TSM-295 using an array tester. The convergence confidences of the estimated parameters are presented and assessed in an easy way. This approach allows all parameters to be optimized, simultaneously. The results are verified and compared with other research studies for different PV cell technologies. The obtained results are useful for the tested PV module manufacturer and assess the performance of the products in different weather conditions.},

  abstract = {The demand for solar photovoltaic (PV) system is growing rapidly driven by new technology and strong economies of scale. PV systems directly convert solar energy into electricity without release any pollution into the environment and deplete natural resources. PV technology has matured and its reliability keeps improving. However, PV system is more expensive to produce than conventional sources of energy due in part to the cost of manufacturing PV devices and in part to the conversion efficiencies of the equipment. Besides, important attention in designing, developing and installing the PV systems is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to predict the PV systems behaviour and performance by considering the plausible factors. The factors accept in this model are solar irradiance and manufacturers' information for the type of PV panel. A case study at the eastern part of Peninsular Malaysia was conducted to examine the effect of factors on the performance of PV. Through the comparative analysis, the results have a good agreement.},

  abstract = {Machine learning models have been successfully used in many scientific and engineering fields. However, it remains difficult for a model to simultaneously utilize domain knowledge and experimental observation data. The application of knowledge-based symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) represented by expert systems is limited by the expressive ability of the model, and data-driven connectionism AI represented by neural networks is prone to produce predictions that might violate physical principles. In order to fully integrate domain knowledge with observations and make full use of the strong fitting ability of neural networks, this study proposes theory-guided hard constraint projection (HCP). This deep learning model converts physical constraints, such as governing equations, into a form that is easy to handle through discretization, and then implements hard constraint optimization through projection in a patch. Based on rigorous mathematical proofs, theory-guided HCP can ensure that model predictions strictly conform to physical mechanisms in the constraint patch. The training process of theory-guided HCP only needs a small amount of labeled data (sparse observation), and it can supervise the model by combining the coordinates (label-free data) with domain knowledge. The performance of the theory-guided HCP is verified by experiments based on a published heterogeneous subsurface flow problem. The experiments show that theory-guided HCP requires fewer data, and achieves higher prediction accuracy and stronger robustness to noisy observations, than the fully connected neural networks and soft constraint models. Furthermore, due to the application of domain knowledge, theory-guided HCP possesses the ability to extrapolate and can accurately predict points outside of the range of the training dataset.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models of biological systems are beginning to be used for safety-critical applications, where large numbers of repeated model evaluations are required to perform uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. Most of these models are nonlinear both in variables and parameters/inputs which has two consequences. First, analytic solutions are rarely available so repeated evaluation of these models by numerically solving differential equations incurs a significant computational burden. Second, many models undergo bifurcations in behaviour as parameters are varied. As a result, simulation outputs often contain discontinuities as we change parameter values and move through parameter/input space. Statistical emulators such as Gaussian processes are frequently used to reduce the computational cost of uncertainty quantification, but discontinuities render a standard Gaussian process emulation approach unsuitable as these emulators assume a smooth and continuous response to changes in parameter values. In this article, we propose a novel two-step method for building a Gaussian Process emulator for models with discontinuous response surfaces. We first use a Gaussian Process classifier to detect boundaries of discontinuities and then constrain the Gaussian Process emulation of the response surface within these boundaries. We introduce a novel `certainty metric' to guide active learning for a multi-class probabilistic classifier. We apply the new classifier to simulations of drug action on a cardiac electrophysiology model, to propagate our uncertainty in a drug's action through to predictions of changes to the cardiac action potential. The proposed two-step active learning method significantly reduces the computational cost of emulating models that undergo multiple bifurcations.},

  abstract = {In applied settings, regression discontinuity (RD) designs often suffer from noisy data and low power. This tends to produce exaggerated causal effect estimates, typified by implausibly large slope and/or concavity parameters. We propose a new method for estimating causal effects in RD designs called Gaussian Process Regression Discontinuity (GPRD). This approach overcomes the major disadvantages of global polynomial estimators and does so with lower variance than local linear estimators. When applied to several recent empirical examples from the published literature, GPRD yields more modest and plausible treatment effect estimates. We make this new method available through the R package gprd. {$\ast$}Postdoctoral Research Associate, Washington University in St. Louis {\dag}PhD Candidate, Washington University in St. Louis 1},

  abstract = {Many methods for modeling functions over high-dimensional spaces assume global smoothness properties; such assumptions are often violated in practice. We introduce a method for modeling functions that display heterogeneity or contain discontinuities. The heterogeneity is dealt with by using a combination of Voronoi tessellation, to partition the input space, and separate Gaussian processes to model the function over different regions of the partitioned space. The proposed method is highly flexible since it allows the Voronoi cells to combine to form regions, which enables nonconvex and disconnected regions to be considered. In such problems, identifying the borders between regions is often of great importance and we propose an adaptive sampling method to gain extra information along such borders. The method is illustrated by simulated examples and an application to real data, in which we see improvements in prediction error over the commonly used stationary Gaussian process and other nonstationary variations. In our application, a computationally expensive computer model that simulates the formation of clouds is investigated, the proposed method more accurately predicts the underlying process at unobserved locations than existing emulation methods.

  abstract = {Probabilistic forecasting of high dimensional multivariate time series is a notoriously challenging task, both in terms of computational burden and distribution modeling. Most previous work either makes simple distribution assumptions or abandons modeling cross-series correlations. A promising line of work exploits scalable matrix factorization for latent-space forecasting, but is limited to linear embeddings, unable to model distributions, and not trainable end-to-end when using deep learning forecasting. We introduce a novel temporal latent auto-encoder method which enables nonlinear factorization of multivariate time series, learned end-to-end with a temporal deep learning latent space forecast model. By imposing a probabilistic latent space model, complex distributions of the input series are modeled via the decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-theart performance on many popular multivariate datasets, with gains sometimes as high as 50\% for several standard metrics.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic system production simulations are conventionally run using hourly weather datasets. Hourly simulations are su{\"y}ciently accurate to predict the majority of long-term system behavior but cannot resolve high-frequency e˙ects like inverter clipping caused by short-duration irradiance variability. Direct modeling of this subhourly clipping error is only possible for the few locations with high-resolution irradiance datasets. This paper describes a method of predicting the magnitude of this error using a machine learning regressor ensemble model, comprised of a random forest and an XGBoost model, and 30-minute satellite irradiance data. The method predicts a correction for each 30-minute interval with the potential to roll up into 60-minute corrections to match an hourly energy model. The model is trained and validated at locations where the error can be directly simulated from 1-minute ground data. The validation shows low bias at most ground station locations. The model is also applied to gridded satellite irradiance to produce a heatmap of the estimated clipping error across the United States. Finally, the relative importance of each predictor satellite variable is retrieved from the model and discussed.},

Temporal correlations in such bursty time series can be understood not only by heterogeneous interevent times (IETs) but also by correlations between IETs. Modeling and simulating various dynamical processes requires us to generate event sequences with a heavy-tailed IET distribution and memory effects between IETs. For this, we propose a Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula-based algorithm for generating event sequences with correlated IETs when the IET distribution and the memory coefficient between two consecutive IETs are given. We successfully apply our algorithm to the cases with heavy-tailed IET distributions. We also compare our algorithm to the existing shuffling method to find that our algorithm outperforms the shuffling method for some cases. Our copula-based algorithm is expected to be used for more realistic modeling of various dynamical processes.},

The inhomogeneities of interevent times have been extensively studied, while the correlations between interevent times, often called correlated bursts, are far from being fully understood. For measuring the correlated bursts, two relevant approaches were suggested, i.e., memory coefficient and burst size distribution. Here a burst size denotes the number of events in a bursty train detected for a given time window. Empirical analyses have revealed that the larger memory coefficient tends to be associated with the heavier tail of the burst size distribution. In particular, empirical findings in human activities appear inconsistent, such that the memory coefficient is close to 0, while burst size distributions follow a power law. In order to comprehend these observations, by assuming the conditional independence between consecutive interevent times, we derive the analytical form of the memory coefficient as a function of parameters describing interevent time and burst size distributions. Our analytical result can explain the general tendency of the larger memory coefficient being associated with the heavier tail of burst size distribution. We also find that the apparently inconsistent observations in human activities are compatible with each other, indicating that the memory coefficient has limits to measure the correlated bursts.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive characterization of non-Poissonian, bursty temporal patterns observed in various natural and social processes is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms behind such temporal patterns. Among them bursty event sequences have been studied mostly in terms of interevent times (IETs), while the higher-order correlation structure between IETs has gained very little attention due to the lack of a proper characterization method. In this paper we propose a method of representing an event sequence by a burst tree, which is then decomposed into a set of IETs and an ordinal burst tree. The ordinal burst tree exactly captures the structure of temporal correlations that is entirely missing in the analysis of IET distributions. We apply this burst-tree decomposition method to various datasets and analyze the structure of the revealed burst trees. In particular, we observe that event sequences show similar burst-tree structure, such as heavy-tailed burst-size distributions, despite of very different IET distributions. This clearly shows that the IET distributions and the burst-tree structures can be separable. The burst trees allow us to directly characterize the preferential and assortative mixing structure of bursts responsible for the higher-order temporal correlations. We also show how to use the decomposition method for the systematic investigation of such correlations captured by the burst trees in the framework of randomized reference models. Finally, we devise a simple kernel-based model for generating event sequences showing appropriate higher-order temporal correlations. Our method is a tool to make the otherwise overwhelming analysis of higher-order correlations in bursty time series tractable by turning it into the analysis of a tree structure.},

To rigorously study these effects, we derive an analytical form of the autocorrelation function for the arbitrary IET distribution in the case with weakly correlated IETs, where the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula is adopted for modeling the joint probability distribution function of two consecutive IETs. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations for exponential and power-law IET distributions. For the power-law case, we find a tendency of the steeper decay of the autocorrelation function for the stronger correlation between IETs. Our analytical approach enables us to better understand long-term temporal correlations induced by the correlations between IETs.},

  abstract = {Atmosphere--ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) are useful to simulate large-scale climate evolutions. However, AOGCM data resolution is too coarse for regional and local climate studies. Downscaling techniques have been developed to refine AOGCM data and provide information at more relevant scales. Among a wide range of available approaches, regression-based methods are commonly used for downscaling AOGCM data. When several variables are considered at multiple sites, regression models are employed to reproduce the observed climate characteristics at small scale, such as the variability and the relationship between sites and variables. This study introduces a probabilistic Gaussian copula regression (PGCR) model for simultaneously downscaling multiple variables at several sites. The proposed PGCR model relies on a probabilistic framework to specify the marginal distribution for each downscaled variable at a given day through AOGCM predictors, and handles multivariate dependence between sites and variables using a Gaussian copula. The proposed model is applied for the downscaling of AOGCM data to daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures in the southern part of Quebec, Canada. Reanalysis products are used in this study to assess the potential of the proposed method. Results of the study indicate the superiority of the proposed model over classical regression-based methods and a multivariate multisite statistical downscaling model.},

  abstract = {The recent price coupling of many European electricity markets has triggered a fundamental change in the interaction of day-ahead prices, challenging additionally the modeling of the joint behavior of prices in interconnected markets. In this paper we propose a regime-switching AR--GARCH copula to model pairs of day-ahead electricity prices in coupled European markets. While capturing key stylized facts empirically substantiated in the literature, this model easily allows us to 1) deviate from the assumption of normal margins and 2) include a more detailed description of the dependence between prices. We base our empirical study on four pairs of prices, namely Germany--France, Germany--Netherlands, Netherlands--Belgium and Germany--Western Denmark. We find that the marginal dynamics are better described by the flexible skew t distribution than the benchmark normal distribution. Also, we find significant evidence of tail dependence in all pairs of interconnected areas we consider. As a first application of the proposed model, we consider the pricing of financial transmission rights, and highlight how the choice of marginal distributions and copula impacts prices. As a second application we consider the forecasting of tail quantiles, and evaluate the out-of-sample performance of competing models.},

  abstract = {Estimating solar irradiance over several locations in a spatial network is of interest for a wide variety of applications, in particular for simulations of distribution grid with high photovoltaic (PV) penetration. This paper presents a method for estimating the clear-sky index for N locations in any spatial network of locations. The model is based on the clear-sky index distribution for one location, and the cross-correlation of clear-sky index between all location pairs. The correlated clearsky index for each location is obtained from a copula model of correlation based on the station pair correlations and the clear-sky index for a single location. In this paper the clear-sky index for a single location is obtained by a bimodal mixture distribution model and the correlation between station pairs is modeled via an exponential model. The model bridges the gap between estimating the clear-sky index for adjacent and maximally dispersed locations. Applications of this model to simulations of aggregate photovoltaic power generation is also discussed.},

In this paper, we propose to use Conditional Generative Adversarial Net (CGAN) to learn and simulate time series data. The conditions can be both categorical and continuous variables containing different kinds of auxiliary information. Our simulation studies show that CGAN is able to learn different kinds of normal and heavy tail distributions, as well as dependent structures of different time series and it can further generate conditional predictive distributions consistent with the training data distributions. We also provide an in-depth discussion on the rationale of GAN and the neural network as hierarchical splines to draw a clear connection with the existing statistical method for distribution generation. In practice, CGAN has a wide range of applications in the market risk and counterparty risk analysis: it can be applied to learn the historical data and generate scenarios for the calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) and predict the movement of the market risk factors. We present a real data analysis including a backtesting to demonstrate CGAN is able to outperform the Historic Simulation, a popular method in market risk analysis for the calculation of VaR. CGAN can also be applied in the economic time series modeling and forecasting, and an example of hypothetical shock analysis for economic models and the generation of potential CCAR scenarios by CGAN is given at the end of the paper.},

For example, real data may be (a) only representative of a subset of situations and domains, (b) expensive to source, (c) limited to specific individuals due to licensing restrictions. Although the use of synthetic data is becoming increasingly popular in computer vision, the training of ML emulators in weather and climate still relies on the use of real data datasets. Here we investigate whether the use of copula-based synthetically-augmented datasets improves the prediction of ML emulators for estimating the downwelling longwave radiation. Results show that bulk errors are cut by up to 75\,\% for the mean bias error (from 0.08 to -0.02\,W\,m-2) and by up to 62\,\% (from 1.17 to 0.44\,W\,m-2) for the mean absolute error, thus showing potential for improving the generalization of future ML emulators.},

  abstract = {Copulas have proven to be very successful tools for the flexible modelling of cross-sectional dependence. In this paper we express the dependence structure of continuous-valued time series data using a sequence of bivariate copulas. This corresponds to a type of decomposition recently called a `vine' in the graphical models literature, where each copula is entitled a `pair-copula'. We propose a Bayesian approach for the estimation of this dependence structure for longitudinal data. Bayesian selection ideas are used to identify any independence pair-copulas, with the end result being a parsimonious representation of a time-inhomogeneous Markov process of varying order. Estimates are Bayesian model averages over the distribution of the lag structure of the Markov process. Using a simulation study we show that the selection approach is reliable and can improve the estimates of both conditional and unconditional pairwise dependencies substantially. We also show that a vine with selection out-performs a Gaussian copula with a flexible correlation matrix. The advantage of the pair-copula formulation is further demonstrated using a longitudinal model of intraday electricity load. Using Gaussian, Gumbel and Clayton pair-copulas we identify parsimonious decompositions of intraday serial dependence, which improve the accuracy of intraday load forecasts. We also propose a new diagnostic for measuring the goodness of fit of high-dimensional multivariate copulas. Overall, the pair-copula model is very general and the Bayesian method generalizes many previous approaches for the analysis of longitudinal data. Supplemental materials for the article are also available online.},

  abstract = {Short-term probabilistic solar forecasts are an important tool in decision-making processes in which uncertainty plays a non-negligible role. Purely statistical models that produce temporal or spatiotemporal probabilistic solar forecasts are generally trained individually, and the combined forecasts therefore lack the temporal or spatiotemporal correlation present in the data. To recover the spatiotemporal dependence structure, a copula can be employed, which constructs a multivariate distribution from which spatially and temporally correlated uniform random numbers can be sampled, which in turn can be used to generate the so-called space-time trajectories via the inverse probability integral transform. In this study, we employ the recently introduced ultra-fast preselection algorithm to leverage the spatiotemporal information present in a pyranometer network and compare its accuracy to that of quantile regression forecasts that only consider temporal information. We show that the preselection algorithm improves both the calibration and sharpness of the predictive distributions. Furthermore, we employ four copulas, i.e., (1) Gaussian, (2) Student-t, (3) Clayton, and (4) empirical, to generate space-time trajectories. The results highlight the necessity to rigorously assess the calibration of the space-time trajectories and the correct modeling of the spatiotemporal dependence structure, which we show through techniques introduced in atmospheric sciences.

In our method, we use Fourier transform and neural network to embed time series into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. The given space is learned such that time series correlation can be effectively approximated from Euclidean distance between corresponding embedded vectors. Therefore, search for correlated time series can be done using an index in the embedding space for efficient nearest neighbor search. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that our method's accuracy can be guaranteed under certain regularity conditions. We further conduct experiments on real-world datasets and the results show that our method indeed outperforms the baseline solution. In particular, for approximation of correlation, our method reduces the approximation loss by a half in most test cases compared to the baseline solution. For top-k highest correlation search, our method improves the precision from 5\% to 20\% while the query time is similar to the baseline approach query time.},

Many existing methods suffer from strong statistical assumptions, numerical issues with high dimensionality, manual feature engineering efforts, and scalability. In this work, we present a novel deep learning architecture, known as Temporal Tensor Transformation Network, which transforms the original multivariate time series into a higher order of tensor through the proposed Temporal-Slicing Stack Transformation. This yields a new representation of the original multivariate time series, which enables the convolution kernel to extract complex and non-linear features as well as variable interactional signals from a relatively large temporal region. Experimental results show that Temporal Tensor Transformation Network outperforms several state-of-theart methods on window-based predictions across various tasks. The proposed architecture also demonstrates robust prediction performance through an extensive sensitivity analysis.},

We proposed a deep architecture termed predictive spatio-temporal network (PSTN), which is a unified framework integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM). Initially, the spatial features are extracted from the spatial wind speed matrices (SWSMs) by the CNN at the bottom of the model. Then, the LSTM captures the temporal dependencies among the spatial features extracted from contiguous time points. Finally, the predicted wind speeds are given by the last state of the top layer of the LSTM, which are generated by using the spatial features and temporal dependencies. Though composed of two kinds of architectures, PSTN is trained with one loss function in an end-to-end (E2E) manner, which can learn temporal and spatial correlations jointly. Experiments for short-term predictions are conducted on real-world data, whose results demonstrate that PSTN outperforms prior methods.},

  abstract = {Stochastic simulation has a prominent position in a variety of scientific domains including those of environmental and water resources sciences. This is due to the numerous applications that can benefit from it, such as risk-related studies. In such domains, stochastic models are typically used to generate synthetic weather data with the desired properties, often resembling those of hydrometeorological observations, which are then used to drive deterministic models of the understudy system. However, generating synthetic weather data with the desired properties is not an easy task. This is due to the peculiarities of such processes, i.e., non-Gaussianity, intermittency, dependence, and periodicity, and the limited availability of open-source software for such purposes. This work aims to simplify the synthetic data generation procedure by providing an R-package called anySim, specifically designed for the simulation of non-Gaussian correlated random variables, stochastic processes at single and multiple temporal scales, and random fields. The functionality of the package is demonstrated through seven simulation studies, accompanied by code snippets, which resemble real-world cases of stochastic simulation (i.e., generation of synthetic weather data) of hydrometeorological processes and fields (e.g., rainfall, streamflow, temperature, etc.), across several spatial and temporal scales (ranging from annual down to 10-min simulations).},

  abstract = {This paper endeavors to provide the reader with an overview of the various tools needed to forecast photovoltaic (PV) power within a very short-term horizon. The study focuses on the specific application of a large scale grid-connected PV farm. Solar resource is largely underexploited worldwide whereas it exceeds by far humans' energy needs. In the current context of global warming, PV energy could potentially play a major role to substitute fossil fuels within the main grid in the future. Indeed, the number of utility-scale PV farms is currently fast increasing globally, with planned capacities in excess of several hundred megawatts. This makes the cost of PV-generated electricity quickly plummet and reach parity with non-renewable resources. However, like many other renewable energy sources, PV power depends highly on weather conditions. This particularity makes PV energy difficult to dispatch unless a properly sized and controlled energy storage system (ESU) is used. An accurate power forecasting method is then required to ensure power continuity but also to manage the ramp rates of the overall power system. In order to perform these actions, the forecasting timeframe also called horizon must be first defined according to the grid operation that is considered. This leads to define both spatial and temporal resolutions. As a second step, an adequate source of input data must be selected. As a third step, the input data must be processed with statistical methods. Finally, the processed data are fed to a precise PV model. It is found that forecasting the irradiance and the cell temperature are the best approaches to forecast precisely swift PV power fluctuations due to the cloud cover. A combination of several sources of input data like satellite and land-based sky imaging also lead to the best results for very-short term forecasting.},

  abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is an important topic in smart-grid and smart-home. Many energy disaggregation algorithms have been proposed to detect various individual appliances from one aggregated signal observation. However, few works studied the energy disaggregation of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) charging in the residential environment since EVs charging at home has emerged only recently. Recent studies showed that EV charging has a large impact on smart-grid especially in summer. Therefore, EV charging monitoring has become a more important and urgent missing piece in energy disaggregation. In this paper, we present a novel method to disaggregate EV charging signals from aggregated real power signals. The proposed method can effectively mitigate interference coming from air-conditioner (AC), enabling accurate EV charging detection and energy estimation under the presence of AC power signals. Besides, the proposed algorithm requires no training, demands a light computational load, delivers high estimation accuracy, and works well for data recorded at the low sampling rate 1/60 Hz. When the algorithm is tested on real-world data recorded from 11 houses over about a whole year (total 125 months worth of data), the averaged error in estimating energy consumption of EV charging is 15.7 kwh/month (while the true averaged energy consumption of EV charging is 208.5 kwh/month), and the averaged normalized mean square error in disaggregating EV charging load signals is 0.19.},

  abstract = {Energy management and savings in residential homes are emerging concerns nowadays because of several challenges facing the energy sector such as energy sources limitations and environmental impacts. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) was introduced as a set of methods and techniques that aim to decompose the total aggregate consumption measured by the smart meter into the consumptions by individual appliances present in the household. The detailed information on energy usage for each device were found to be a good influencing method for the residents to adopt better devices usage profiles which lead eventually to noticeable energy savings. Recent research had shown that the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and its extensions are effective models in the load disaggregation problem. The authors had introduced a new unsupervised approach for load disaggregation that includes the mutual devices interactions information into the Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) representation of the aggregate signal in an earlier work. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive approach for estimating devices main power consumptions and their two-way interactions during the disaggregation process. The adaptive approach is used to mimic the changes in devices consumptions and two-way interactions. The adaptive estimation process was carried out only for cases when there are four devices or less that are operating/ON instantaneously. The proposed approach was tested with data from the REDD public data set and it showed better performance in terms of energy disaggregation accuracy compared with the standard FHMM. The adaptive estimating of main factors effects (primary power consumptions) and two-way interactions during the disaggregation process provided higher disaggregation accuracy results, in general, than those with fixed factors and two-way interactions values.},

  abstract = {Non-invasive load monitoring (NILM) is a vital step to realize the smart grid. Although the existing various NILM algorithms have made significant progress in energy consumption feedback, there are still some problems need to further addressed, such as the exponential growth of state space with the increase of the number of multi-state devices, which leads to the dimension disaster; and it is difficult to capture the power fluctuation information effectively because of the neglect of time-dependency problem load disaggregation; traditional disaggregation involves a process of one sequence to one sequence optimization, which is inefficient. In our study, a composite deep LSTM is proposed for load disaggregation. The proposed algorithm considers the process of load disaggregation as a signal separation process and establishes regression learning from a single sequence to multiple sequences to avoid dimension disaster. In addition, an encoder-separation-decoder structure is introduced for load disaggregation. Encoder completes the effective encoding of the mains power and differential power information, the time-dependency of the encoding process implemented by a deep LSTM, separation realizes the disaggregation process by separating the encoded information, and decoder decode the separated signal into the sequences of corresponding electrical appliances. Compared with the one sequence to one sequence disaggregation method, the proposed method simplified disaggregation complexity and improves the efficiency of disaggregation. The experimental results on WikiEnergy and REDD datasets show that the proposed method can reduce the disaggregation error and improve the comprehensive performance of event detection. Besides, our study can provide conditions for the realization of the bidirectional interaction of the smart grid and the improvement of the smart grid scheduling.},

  abstract = {Because of the stochastic nature of wind turbines, the output power management of wind power generation (WPG) is a fundamental challenge for the integration of wind energy systems into either power systems or microgrids (i.e., isolated systems consisting of local wind energy systems only) in operation and planning studies. In general, a wind energy system can refer to both one wind farm consisting of a number of wind turbines and a given number of wind farms sited at the area in question. In power systems (microgrid) planning, a WPG should be quantified for the determination of the expected power flows and the analysis of the adequacy of power generation. Concerning this operation, the WPG should be incorporated into an optimal operation decision process, as well as unit commitment and economic dispatch studies. In both cases, the probabilistic investigation of WPG leads to a multivariate uncertainty analysis problem involving correlated random variables (the output power of either wind turbines that constitute wind farm or wind farms sited at the area in question) that follow different distributions. This paper advances a multivariate model of WPG for a wind farm that relies on indexed semi-Markov chains (ISMC) to represent the output power of each wind energy system in question and a copula function to reproduce the spatial dependencies of the energy systems' output power. The ISMC model can reproduce long-term memory effects in the temporal dependence of turbine power and thus understand, as distinct cases, the plethora of Markovian models. Using copula theory, we incorporate non-linear spatial dependencies into the model that go beyond linear correlations. Some copula functions that are frequently used in applications are taken into consideration in the paper; i.e., Gumbel copula, Gaussian copula, and the t-Student copula with different degrees of freedom. As a case study, we analyze a real dataset of the output powers of six wind turbines that constitute a wind farm situated in Poland. This dataset is compared with the synthetic data generated by the model thorough the calculation of three adequacy indices commonly used at the first hierarchical level of power system reliability studies; i.e., loss of load probability (LOLP), loss of load hours (LOLH) and loss of load expectation (LOLE). The results will be compared with those obtained using other models that are well known in the econometric field; i.e., vector autoregressive models (VAR).},

We propose to combine an RNN-based time series model with a Gaussian copula process output model with a low-rank covariance structure to reduce the computational complexity and handle non-Gaussian marginal distributions. This permits to drastically reduce the number of parameters and consequently allows the modeling of time-varying correlations of thousands of time series.

This is particularly true in the case of buildings with integrated photovoltaics (PV) systems having a wide range of orientations and inclinations defined by the skin of the building. Since solar radiation data at the plane of interest is hardly ever available, this study presents the analysis of two of the most representative transposition models used to obtain the in-plane irradiance using as input data the global and diffuse irradiation on the horizontal plane, which can be obtained by satellite-based models or ground measurements. Both transposition models are validated with experimental measurements taken in Murcia (southeast of Spain) and datasets provided by the photovoltaic geographical information system (PVGIS) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for vertical surfaces facing the four cardinal points. For the validation, the mean bias deviation, root mean square error and forecasted skill were used as indicators. Results show that the error rate decreases slightly for clear days. Better results are also obtained by dismissing data with low solar elevation angles so as to avoid shadowing effects from the surroundings in the early and late hours of the day, which affects mainly the performance of the transposition models for west and east surfaces. The results highlight the potential of equator-facing fa{\c c}ades in winter time when the received irradiation can be twice as much as the one collected by the horizontal plane. It is also noteworthy that the operating conditions of all fa{\c c}ades are mainly low irradiance and medium temperature at these locations.},

Internet of Electric vehicles (IoEV) as well as their hybrid forms provide an ideal means of supporting sustainability within an ITS. The control of charging/discharging of EV is still a challenge, despite the tremendous research progress to date in the field. In this paper, the use of charging station data and binary vectorization are proposed in order to provide timely insights on the dynamic behavior of charging processes. A Bag-of-Power-States model has been created for similarity measurement of charging stations within given time periods. The results of experimentations using synthetic data have shown that the proposed Bag-of-Power-States model is computationally feasible and provides useful results for optimizing the scheduling of power supply to charging stations that may be located across a wide range of distances, over the same period of time.},

Furthermore, limit amount of labeled data is a bottleneck for all existing literature. This paper proposed a deep transfer learning based method for energy disaggregation. Each load has its own disaggregtor, which consists of a feature extractor and a regressor. Unlike existing methods, a semi-supervised learning using deep domain adaptation is proposed, which can align the energy data distribution to some extent by utilizing both the labeled and the unlabeled data.

  abstract = {In the USA, residential photovoltaic (PV) systems are often configured for net metering ``behind-the-meter'', where PV energy generation and building energy demand are reported as a combined net load to advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) meters, impeding estimates of PV generation. This work presents a methodology for modeling individual array and system-wide PV generation using only weather data, premise AMI data, and the approximate date of PV installation -- information available to most distribution utilities. The study uses 36~months of data spanning nearly 850 homes with installed PV systems in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. The algorithm estimates building energy consumption by comparing time periods before PV installation with similar periods after PV installation that have common weather and activity characteristics. Estimated building energy consumption is then compared with AMI meter data to estimate otherwise unobservable solar generation. To assess accuracy, modeled outputs are compared with directly metered PV generation and white-box physical models of PV production. Considering aggregate, utility-wide, generation estimates for the three year study period, the proposed method estimates over 75\% of all days to within {\textpm}20\% of established physical models. The method estimates more effectively in summer months when PV generation peaks and is of most interest to utilities. The model often outperforms physical models for days with snow cover and for arrays with shading or complex multi-roof implementations. The model also supports day-ahead PV prediction using forecasted weather data.},

The state-of-art indicates a large amount of high-frequency measurement ({$>$}1 Hz) can lead to accurate disaggregation. This paper, however, proposes a disaggregation algorithm relies on hourly smart meter readings, aiming to extend the application of the low-frequency data that is accessible by both utilities and customers. The output of the disaggregation includes the breakdown of energy into load-category-based components that have different average power factors. The disaggregated data will support small-scale planning, e.g., in microgrid, by revealing the variance and patterns in different load categories. Our approach is built on a top-down structure that requires no prior knowledge or general models of individual loads. Using clustering and optimization techniques, we infer the load signatures of each category based on the active and reactive power from smart meters. The signatures are updated periodically using the most recent smart meter data. The results show that our disaggregation approach could be applied to random houses in different seasons and to single house and small neighborhood in both offline and quasi-real-time context.},

However, the fine- grained usage data collected by the smart meters also raises privacy concerns. The household load profile can be analyzed by non-intrusive load monitoring techniques to infer customer activity routines and behavioral preference. Several data ob- fuscation techniques based on controlling a local rechargeable battery or a controllable load have been proposed to mitigate the privacy leakage of the customers. In this paper, we introduce the use of electric vehicles (EVs) for load hiding. In particular, we propose an EV-assisted battery load hiding algorithm, which combines the use of an EV with a local rechargeable battery to achieve the dual purpose of optimal charging and measurement obfuscation. Since EVs are becoming increasingly popular and part of many households, their use renders the implementation of load hiding less costly compared to methods only using dedicated rechargeable batteries. Furthermore, EVs provide more flexibility than other household loads in terms of energy storage. We evaluate our proposed algorithm using real data for electricity price, household consumption, and EV parameters. Adopting mutual information as a measure for information leakage, nu- merical results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce th},

These detailed information on  11 individual appliances consumptions can influence the users to follow better energy usage profiles so as to  12 achieve energy savings. We introduce a novel energy disaggregation model that consider mutual devices  13 interactions and embed the information on devices interactions into the Factorial Hidden Markov Models  14 (FHMM) representations of the aggregated data.

Data collected this way is an aggregation of the power de- mands of all appliances within a building, hence inferences on the operation of individual devices cannot be drawn directly. By using methods to disaggregate data collected from a single measurement location, however, appliance-level detail can often be reconstructed. A major impediment to the improvement of such disaggregation algorithms lies in the way they are evaluated so far: Their per- formance is generally assessed using a small number of publicly available electricity consumption data sets recorded from actual buildings. As a result, algorithm parameters are often tuned to pro- duce optimal results for the used data sets, but do not necessarily generalize to different input data well. We propose to break this tradition by presenting a toolchain to create synthetic benchmark- ing data sets for the evaluation of disaggregation performance in this work. Generated synthetic data with a configurable amount of concurrent appliance activity is subsequently used to comparatively evaluate eight existing disaggregation algorithms. This way, we not only create a baseline for the comparison of newly developed disaggregation methods, but also point out the data characteristics that pose challenges for the state-of-the-art.},

Given the appropriate performance characteristics, these technologies have the potential to enable many utility and customer facing applications. However, there has been skepticism concerning the ability of load disaggregation products to accurately identify and estimate energy consumption of end-uses; which has hindered wide-spread market adoption. A contributing factor is that common test methods and metrics are unavailable to evaluate performance without conducting large-scale field demonstrations and pilots, which can be costly. Without common and costeffective methods of evaluation, advanced NILM technologies will continue to be slow to market and potential users will remain uncertain about their capabilities. This paper reviews recent field studies and laboratory tests of NILM technologies. Several important factors are identified for consideration in test protocols so their results reflect real world performance. Potential metrics are examined to highlight their effectiveness in quantifying disaggregation performance. This analysis is then used to suggest performance metrics that are meaningful and of value to potential users and that will enable researchers/developers to identify beneficial ways to improve their technologies.},

  abstract = {Residential energy disaggregation is a process by which the power usage of a home is broken down into the consumption of individual appliances. There are a number of different methods to perform energy disaggregation, from simulation models to installing "smart-plugs" at every outlet where an appliance is connected to the wall. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is one such disaggregation option. NILM is widely recognized as one of the most cost-effective methods for gathering disaggregated energy data while maintaining a high level of accuracy. Although the technology has existed for many years, the adoption rate of NILM, and other devices that disaggregate energy, has been minimal. This thesis provides details on the potential benefits, both for the customer and utility provider, associated with furthering the adoption of NILM devices and obtaining the disaggregated appliance level energy-use. A broad overview of potential benefits is presented; however, the primary goal of this thesis will be to investigate two benefits of NILM in detail: overall household energy reduction and targeted demand response. First, installation of a NILM device can provide electricity customers information that allows them to become more aware of their energy consumption, and thereby, more energy efficient. A study was conducted that looked at the electricity consumption of 174 homes that were using a passive NILM device in their home. This NILM device provided immediate feedback on the power consumption for a portion of the home's appliances via smart-phone application. The homes reduced their monthly energy consumption by an average of 2.6 - 3.1\% after the NILM installation. This was validated by a number of analysis methods returning similar results. Aligned with this benefit comes a recommendation for an incentive structure that can reduce the price paid by the consumer and develop a higher adoption rate of NILM devices. Second, the wide-spread adoption of NILM devices can provide electric utilities information to reduce carbon intensity via targeted demand response. There is a significant opportunity for utilities to engage their customers based on the time of use of detailed appliances. Multiple metrics are presented in this thesis to quantify the deferrable load opportunity of specific appliances and individual households. Utility operational cost savings and greater customer incentives can be linked to the use of these metrics.},

  abstract = {Electricity is one of the valuables and widely used forms of energy. However, with the fast-paced technological development in the electrical and electronics market, the electricity demand is on a constant rise. To tackle energy and sustainability issues, two paths can be followed by the world community. Either new generation plants to be established with an expense of millions of dollars or to explore the existing system by integrating innovative techniques that can lead to energy efficiency and conservation. The latter one is a more viable solution, and the research community is extensively working to propose and develop innovative techniques towards energy efficiency and conservation. In this context, energy monitoring is one of the key techniques that play a significant role in the field of sustainable energy.    Load disaggregation is one of these promising energy monitoring techniques, where a non-intrusive load disaggregation technique commonly referred to as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is widely adopted to provide individual load profiles to the stakeholders. Appliance-level energy monitoring is not only beneficial for the consumers in terms of having valuable information regarding the operation status of their loads and corresponding consumption but also benefit the system operators, policymakers, and manufacturers in terms of analyzing the network's energy flow, creating policies/tariffs, and manufacturing of smart appliances, respectively.     This research work contributes to the existing research and development of non-invasive load disaggregation systems, by proposing and developing a robust event-based non-intrusive load disaggregation approach for low sampling data granularity. As a way forward, this research work contributes to different aspects of a NILM system. For NILM event detection, three new low complexity and computationally fast algorithms based on statistical parameters are proposed and validated on real-world datasets. In terms of electrical load features, a set of nine distinct load features based on statistical, geometrical, and power features is proposed. The extracted load features are further investigated in terms of significance using different feature selection methodologies and the extracted results are validated in the context of classification performance. For load classification, this research work investigated different supervised machine learning models towards an optimal learning model for the given conditions. In addition to standalone machine learning models, this research also presents a combinatorial learning model, i.e., ensemble learning, for load classification in the context of the NILM. Further, a comprehensive comparative evaluation of these techniques is also part of this thesis.     The entire digital simulations and corresponding analysis presented in this research work are based on real-world electricity datasets, originating from different geographical regions, i.e., New Zealand and the United States of America. Based on the low data granularity of the employed databases, three different appliances/circuits, i.e., air conditioning unit, electric vehicle charging, and water heating are successfully disaggregated using the proposed non-intrusive load disaggregation approach. Moreover, a proof of concept in terms of real-world deployment, i.e., the application of the proposed non-intrusive load disaggregation, is also proposed and validated in this research work.     Due to low data granularity nature, this research work is more relevant for the existing metering infrastructure. Therefore, the proposed methodologies and corresponding simulation studies presented in this research work will significantly contribute to the existing state of the art on low sampling NILM systems particularly in terms of event detection, electrical load features, and learning model selection. The study presented in this thesis will also facilitate future research in terms of real-world deployment of NILM systems and its broader applications. Concisely, this research work based on a non-invasive load disaggregation approach is a way forward for energy efficient systems.},

However, smart meters typically provide only hourly measurements of consumption while most load disaggregation techniques require at least minute level data. We use machine and deep learning methods to detect EV signatures in hourly smart meter data. Models are trained and evaluated on labelled data, before being tested on unlabelled field data. While balanced models catch about 75\% of EVs at false positive rates of 35\%, tuned models detect up to 90\% of EVs with 10\% false positives. When using models to detect EVs on unlabelled Norwegian smart meter data, detections are in line with EV fractions from the national registry as well as expected spatiotemporal patterns. However, models may be confused by baseline consumption patterns. Collection and inclusion of labelled EVs is therefore the next step.},

  abstract = {Recently, and with the growing development of big energy datasets, data-driven learning techniques began to represent a potential solution to the energy disaggregation problem outperforming engineered and hand-crafted models. However, most proposed deep disaggregation models are load-dependent in the sense that either expert knowledge or a hyper-parameter optimization stage is required prior to training and deployment (normally for each load category) even upon acquisition and cleansing of aggregate and sub-metered data. In this paper, we present a feasibility study on the development of a generic disaggregation model based on data-driven learning. Specifically, we present a generic deep disaggregation model capable of achieving state-of-art performance in load monitoring for a variety of load categories. The developed model is evaluated on the publicly available UK-DALE dataset with a moderately low sampling frequency and various domestic loads.},

  abstract = {The joint analysis of spatial and temporal processes poses computational challenges due to the data's high dimensionality. Furthermore, such data are commonly non-Gaussian. In this paper, we introduce a copula-based spatiotemporal model for analyzing spatiotemporal data and propose a semiparametric estimator. The proposed algorithm is computationally simple, since it models the marginal distribution and the spatiotemporal dependence separately. Instead of assuming a parametric distribution, the proposed method models the marginal distributions nonparametrically and thus offers more flexibility. The method also provides a convenient way to construct both point and interval predictions at new times and locations, based on the estimated conditional quantiles. Through a simulation study and an analysis of wind speeds observed along the border between Oregon and Washington, we show that our method produces more accurate point and interval predictions for skewed data than those based on normality assumptions.},

  abstract = {A large share of the wind energy produced in Scandinavia is sold at deregulated electricity markets. The main market, Elspot, is a day-ahead market where energy is sold up to 36 hours before delivery. Failure in delivering exactly the quantity which was sold results in a fine, called regulation cost. As wind energy comes from an uncontrollable energy source - the wind - producers can not always fulfil their sales obligations and must, therefore, often pay high regulation costs. In this thesis it is examined how producers can increase their profit by bidding on the market in such a way that the regulation cost is minimised. The methods developed rely on new production forecasts which provide better probabilistic information about the prediction uncertainty than many forecasting systems currently in use. The problem is formulated in two different ways. One, originally presented by John B. Bremnes, where only a part of the market is included, gives a simple method that can be applied using only statistical tools. The other method is more exible at the cost of complexity. It uses both statistics and stochastic programming. This method can be changed and applied in other markets with a structure different from that of the Scandinavian market, NordPool. Keywords: Electricity market, Wind energy, NordPool, Quantile Regression, Stochastic Programming.},

Traditionally, these forecasts are based on meteorological physics models whose parameters are tuned by coarse-grained radiometric tiles sensed from geo-satellites. This research presents a novel application of deep neural network approach to observe and estimate short-term weather effects from videos. Specifically, we use time-lapsed videos (sky-videos) obtained from upward facing wide-lensed cameras (sky-cameras) to directly estimate and forecast solar irradiance. We introduce and present results on two large publicly available datasets obtained from weather stations in two regions of North America using relatively inexpensive optical hardware. These datasets contain over a million images that span for 1 and 12 years respectively, the largest such collection to our knowledge. Compared to satellite based approaches, the proposed deep learning approach significantly reduces the normalized mean-absolute-percentage error for both nowcasting, i.e. prediction of the solar irradiance at the instance the frame is captured, as well as forecasting, ahead-of-time irradiance prediction for a duration for upto 4 hours.},

  abstract = {Akin to many subareas of computer vision, the recent advances in deep learning have also significantly influenced the literature on optical flow. Previously, the literature had been dominated by classical energy-based models, which formulate optical flow estimation as an energy minimization problem. However, as the practical benefits of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over conventional methods have become apparent in numerous areas of computer vision and beyond, they have also seen increased adoption in the context of motion estimation to the point where the current state of the art in terms of accuracy is set by CNN approaches. We first review this transition as well as the developments from early work to the current state of CNNs for optical flow estimation. Alongside, we discuss some of their technical details and compare them to recapitulate which technical contribution led to the most significant accuracy improvements. Then we provide an overview of the various optical flow approaches introduced in the deep learning age, including those based on alternative learning paradigms (e.g., unsupervised and semi-supervised methods) as well as the extension to the multi-frame case, which is able to yield further accuracy improvements.},

  abstract = {Surface Solar Irradiance (SSI) is a key parameter dictating surface-atmosphere interactions, driving radiative, hydrological, and land surface processes, and can thus impinge greatly upon weather and climate. It is thereby a prerequisite of many studies and applications. Estimating SSI from satellites began in the 1960s, and is currently the principal way to map SSI spatiotemporal distributions from regional to global scales. Starting from an overview of historical studies carried out in the past several decades, this paper reviews the progresses made in methodology, validation, and products over these years. First, the requirements of SSI in various studies or applications are presented along with the theoretical background of SSI satellite estimation. Methods to estimate SSI from satellites are then summarized as well as their advantages and limitations. Validations of satellite-based SSI on two typical spatial scales are discussed followed by a brief description of existing products and their accuracies. Finally, the challenges faced by current SSI satellite estimation are analyzed, and possible improvements to implement in the future are suggested. This review not only updates the review paper by Pinker et al. (1995) on satellite methods to derive SSI but also offers a more comprehensive summary of the related studies and applications.},

  abstract = {Surface solar radiation forecasting permits to predict photovoltaic plant production for a massive and safe integration of solar energy into the electric network. For short-term forecasts (intra-day), methods using images from meteorological geostationary satellites are more suitable than numerical weather prediction models. Forecast schemes consist in assessing cloud motion vectors and in extrapolating cloud patterns from a given satellite image in order to predict cloud cover state above a PV plant. Atmospheric motion vectors retrieval techniques have been studied for several decades in order to improve weather forecasts. However, solar energy forecasting requires the extraction of cloud motion vectors on a finer spatial- and time-resolution than those provided for weather forecast applications. Even if motion vector retrieval is a wide research field in image processing related topics, only block-matching techniques are operationally used for solar energy forecasts via satellite images. In this paper, we propose two motion vectors extraction methods originating from video compression techniques (correlation phase and optical flow methods). We implemented them on a 6-day dataset of Meteosat-10 satellite diurnal images. We proceeded to cloud pattern extrapolation and compared predicted cloud maps against actual ones at different time horizons from 15 minutes to 4 hours ahead. Forecast scores were compared to the state-of-the-art (block matching) method. Correlation phase methods do not outperform block-matching but their computation time is about 25 times shorter. Optical flow based method outperforms all the methods with a satisfactory time computing.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing integration of solar power into the electrical grid, forecasting short-term solar irradiance has become key for many applications, e.g. operational planning, power purchases, reserve activation, etc. In this context, as solar generators are geographically dispersed and ground measurements are not always easy to obtain, it is very important to have general models that can predict solar irradiance without the need of local data. In this paper, a model that can perform short-term forecasting of solar irradiance in any general location without the need of ground measurements is proposed. To do so, the model considers satellite-based measurements and weather-based forecasts, and employs a deep neural network structure that is able to generalize across locations; particularly, the network is trained only using a small subset of sites where ground data is available, and the model is able to generalize to a much larger number of locations where ground data does not exist. As a case study, 25 locations in The Netherlands are considered and the proposed model is compared against four local models that are individually trained for each location using ground measurements. Despite the general nature of the model, it is shown show that the proposed model is equal or better than the local models: when comparing the average performance across all the locations and prediction horizons, the proposed model obtains a 31.31\% rRMSE (relative root mean square error) while the best local model achieves a 32.01\% rRMSE.},

Solar power forecasting is then necessary to better exploit this variability and to increase the penetration of photovoltaic power into the energy mix. Solar energy forecasting involves prediction of cloud property above a given point. For several hour ahead forecasts, using images from meteorological geostationary satellite is the most suitable solution. We propose a forecasting method based on a phase correlation algorithm for motion estimation between subsequent cloud maps derived from Meteosat-9 images. The method is assessed against state-of-the-art over a limited area over South of France for a 4-hour period. Cloud index maps are predicted. Our forecasting are 21 \% better than persistence in relative RMSE of cloud index. If state-of-the-art shows better results (23 \%), our algorithm reduces computing of 25 \% and then minimize operational solar forecasting constraints.},

  abstract = {The contribution of power production by PV systems to the electricity supply is constantly increasing. An efficient use of the fluctuating solar power production will highly benefit from forecast information on the expected power production. This forecast information is necessary for the management of the electricity grids and for solar energy trading. This paper will present and evaluate an approach to forecast regional PV power production. The forecast quality was investigated for single systems and for ensembles of distributed PV systems. Due to spatial averaging effects the forecast for an ensemble of distributed systems shows higher quality than the forecast for single systems. Forecast errors are reduced to an RMSE of 0.05 Wh/Wp for an ensemble of the size of Germany compared to a RMSE of 0.13 Wh/Wp for single PV systems. Besides the forecast accuracy, also the specification of the forecast uncertainty is an important issue for an effective application. An approach to derive weather specific confidence intervals is presented that describe the maximum expected uncertainty of the forecast.},

  abstract = {One of the most basic skills a robot should possess is predicting the effect of physical interactions with objects in the environment. This enables optimal action selection to reach a certain goal state. Traditionally, dynamics are approximated by physics-based analytical models. These models rely on specific state representations that may be hard to obtain from raw sensory data, especially if no knowledge of the object shape is assumed. More recently, we have seen learning approaches that can predict the effect of complex physical interactions directly from sensory input. It is however an open question how far these models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we investigate the advantages and limitations of neural network based learning approaches for predicting the effects of actions based on sensory input and show how analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of both worlds. As physical interaction task, we use planar pushing, for which there exists a well-known analytical model and a large real-world dataset. We propose to use a convolutional neural network to convert raw depth images or organized point clouds into a suitable representation for the analytical model and compare this approach to using neural networks for both, perception and prediction. A systematic evaluation of the proposed approach on a very large real-world dataset shows two main advantages of the hybrid architecture. Compared to a pure neural network, it significantly (i) reduces required training data and (ii) improves generalization to novel physical interaction.},

Like the existing version, this new version is intended for direct, out-of-the-box application throughout North America without requiring training/feedback from measured data. The existing version was recently identified by EPRI as most accurate among thirteen operational models after an independent evaluation in two climatically distinct US regions. This new version shows further measurable performance improvements and operational functionality with capability of using historical satellite data for model training purposes. The advantage of incorporating historical satellite data is that it allows this forecast application to scale to all sizes of PV systems (large utility-scale down to individual rooftop) without the requirement of site-measured inputs. This new approach exhibits a 1-5\% root mean square error (RMSE) improvement over the forecast horizon up to two-days in advance.},

  abstract = {For short-term solar irradiance forecasting, the traditional point forecasting methods are rendered less useful due to the non-stationary characteristic of solar power. The amount of operating reserves required to maintain reliable operation of the electric grid rises due to the variability of solar energy. The higher the uncertainty in the generation, the greater the operating-reserve requirements, which translates to an increased cost of operation. In this research work, we propose a unified architecture for multi-time-scale predictions for intra-day solar irradiance forecasting using recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs). This paper also lays out a framework for extending this modeling approach to intra-hour forecasting horizons thus, making it a multi-time-horizon forecasting approach, capable of predicting intra-hour as well as intra-day solar irradiance. We develop an end-to-end pipeline to effectuate the proposed architecture. The performance of the prediction model is tested and validated by the methodical implementation. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated with case studies conducted for geographically scattered sites across the United States. The predictions demonstrate that our proposed unified architecture-based approach is effective for multi-time-scale solar forecasts and achieves a lower root-mean-square prediction error when benchmarked against the best-performing methods documented in the literature that use separate models for each time-scale during the day. Our proposed method results in a 71.5\% reduction in the mean RMSE averaged across all the test sites compared to the ML-based best-performing method reported in the literature. Additionally, the proposed method enables multi-time-horizon forecasts with real-time inputs, which have a significant potential for practical industry applications in the evolving grid.},

  abstract = {Probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (pCLE) enables more accurate diagnosis via optical biopsy. pCLE probes relay on of fibres bundles, which generate irregularly sampled signals. Current pCLE reconstruction is based on interpolating irregular signals onto an over-sampled Cartesian grid, using a sub-optimal Delaunay triangulation based linear interpolation scheme. High-quality reconstruction with improved information representation should be possible with the use of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, classical CNNs are limited to take as an input only Cartesian images, not irregular data. In this work, we propose to embed Nadaraya-Watson (NW) kernel regression into the CNN framework as a novel trainable CNN layer that allows for processing of irregularly sampled data represented as sparse data on a Cartesian grid. We design a new NWNet architecture in conjunction with examplar-based super-resolution CNN, which allows reconstructing high-quality pCLE images from the irregularly sampled input data. Models were trained on a database of 8806 images from 238 pCLE video sequences. The results were validated through an image quality assessment based on a composition of the following metrics: PSNR, SSIM, GCF. Our analysis indicates that the proposed solution unlocks the potential of CNNs for sparse data processing. NW layer is the main contribution of our end-to-end model performing pCLE image reconstruction directly from sparse imaging input to high-resolution cartesian images. Our method outperforms the reconstruction method in current clinical use.},

  abstract = {Predicting solar irradiance has been an important topic in renewable energy generation. Prediction improves the planning and operation of photovoltaic systems and yields many economic advantages for electric utilities. The irradiance can be predicted using statistical methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), or autoregressive moving average (ARMA). However, they either lack accuracy because they cannot capture long-term dependency or cannot be used with big data because of the scalability. This paper presents a method to predict the solar irradiance using deep neural networks. Deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) add complexity to the model without specifying what form the variation should take and allow the extraction of high-level features. The DRNN is used to predict the irradiance. The data utilized in this study is real data obtained from natural resources in Canada. The simulation of this method will be compared to several common methods such as support vector regression and feedforward neural networks (FNN). The results show that deep learning neural networks can outperform all other methods, as the performance tests indicate.},

Meanwhile, an optimal load dispatch model for grid-connected community microgrid which includes residential power load, PV arrays, electric vehicles (EVs), and energy storage system (ESS), is established under three different scheduling scenarios. To promote the supply-demand balance, the uncertainties of both residential power load and PV power output are considered in the model by integrating the forecasting results. Two real-world data sets are used to test the proposed forecasting model, and the results show that the DRNN-LSTM model performs better than multi-layer perception (MLP) network and support vector machine (SVM). Finally, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the load dispatch of grid-connected community microgrid. The results show that EES and the coordinated charging mode of EVs can promote peak load shifting and reduce 8.97\% of the daily costs. This study contributes to the optimal load dispatch of community microgrid with load and renewable energy forecasting. The optimal load dispatch of community microgrid with deep learning based solar power and load forecasting achieves total costs reduction and system reliability improvement.},

The covariance function that encodes prior belief on the general shape of the time series plays a vital role in the performance of GPs and a common choice is the squared exponential (SE), although it has been argued that the SE is likely suboptimal for physical processes. Therefore, we thoroughly test various (combinations of) covariance functions. Furthermore, in order bypass the substantial learning and inference time accompanied with GPs, we investigate the potential of dynamically updating the hyperparameters using a moving training window and assess the consequences on predictive accuracy. We show that the dynamic GP produces sharper prediction intervals (PIs) than the static GP with significant lower computational burden, but at the cost of the ability to capture sharp peaks. In addition, we examine the difference in accuracy between a direct and indirect forecasting strategy in case of net demand forecasting and show that the latter is prone to producing wider PIs with higher coverage probability.},

An accurate prediction of GHI is necessary for reliable grid integration of the renewable as well as for power market trading. While some machine learning techniques are well introduced along with the traditional time-series forecasting techniques, deep-learning techniques remains less explored for the task at hand. In this paper we give deep learning models suitable for sequence to sequence prediction of GHI. The deep learning models are reported for shortterm forecasting 1 - 24 hour along with the state-of-the art techniques like Gradient Boosted Regression Trees(GBRT) and Feed Forward Neural Networks(FFNN). We have checked that spatio-temporal features like wind direction, wind speed and GHI of neighboring location improves the prediction accuracy of the deep learning models significantly. Among the various sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder models LSTM performed superior, handling short-comings of the stateof-the-art techniques.},

  abstract = {The intermittency of solar energy resources has brought a big challenge for the optimization and planning of a future smart grid. To reduce the intermittency, an accurate prediction of photovoltaic (PV) power generation is very important. Therefore, this paper proposes a new forecasting method based on the recurrent neural network (RNN). At first, the entire solar power time series data is divided into inter-day data and intra-day data. Then, we apply RNN to discover the nonlinear features and invariant structures exhibited in the adjacent days and intraday data. After that, a new point prediction model is proposed, only by taking the previous PV power data as input without weather information. The forecasting horizons are set from 15 to 90 minutes. The proposed forecasting method is tested by using real solar power in Flanders, Belgium. The classical persistence method (Persistence), back propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function (RBF) neural network and support vector machine (SVM), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are adopted as benchmarks. Extensive results show that the proposed forecasting method exhibits a good forecasting quality on very short-term forecasting, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed forecasting model.},

The Convolution network is applied to robustly extract data input features from predictive variables (i.e., statistically significant antecedent inputs) while Long Short-Term Memory absorbs them for prediction. Half-hourly GSR for Alice Springs (Australia: 01 January 2006 to 31 August 2018) are extracted with stationarity checks applied via unit-root and mutual information test to capture antecedent GSR values required to forecast future GSR. The proposed hybrid model is benchmarked with standalone models as well as other Deep Learning, Single Hidden Layer and Tree based models. The results show that the benchmarked models are not able to generate satisfactory GSR predictions and the proposed hybrid model outperforms all other counterparts. The hybrid model registers superior results with over 70\% of predictive errors lying below {\textpm}10 Wm-2 and outperforms the benchmark model for 1-Day half-hourly GSR prediction with low Relative Root Mean Square Error ({$\approx$}1.515\%), Mean Absolute Percentage Error ({$\approx$}4.672\%) and Absolute Percentage Bias ({$\approx$}1.233\%). This study ascertains that a proposed hybrid model based on a convolution network framework can accurately predict GSR and enable energy availability to be regularly monitored over multi-step horizons when coupled with a low latency Long Short-Term Memory network. Furthermore, it also concludes that the proposed model can have practical implications in forecasting GSR, capitalizing its versatility as a stratagem in monitoring solar powered systems by integrating freely available solar radiation into a real power grid system.},

Long-term solar generation forecasting is an important issue in microgrid planning and design from an engineering point of view.

The proposed method uses historical solar radiation data and clear sky global horizontal irradiance (GHI). Even though all the models performed well, GRU performed relatively better compared to the other models.

However, the solar resource has intermittent feature in electricity production, making it difficult to manage the electrical system.

Additionally, integration of AI methods in a new adaptive topology based on the Portfolio Theory (PT) is proposed hereby to improve solar forecasts. PT takes advantage of diversified forecast assets: when one of the assets shows prediction errors, these are offset by another asset. After testing with data from Spain and Brazil, results show that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for predictions using DL is 6.89\% and for the proposed integration (called PrevPT) is 5.36\% concerning data from Spain. For the data from Brazil, MAPE for predictions using DL is 6.08\% and 4.52\% for PrevPT. In both cases, DL and PrevPT results are better than the other techniques being used.},

  abstract = {East Asian regions in the North Pacific have recently experienced severe riverine flood disasters. State-of-the-art neural networks are currently utilized as a quick-response flood model. Neural networks typically require ample time in the training process because of the use of numerous datasets. To reduce the computational costs, we introduced a transfer-learning approach to a neural-network-based flood model. For a concept of transfer leaning, once the model is pretrained in a source domain with large datasets, it can be reused in other target domains. After retraining parts of the model with the target domain datasets, the training time can be reduced due to reuse. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed because the CNN with transfer learning has numerous successful applications in two-dimensional image classification. However, our flood model predicts time-series variables (e.g., water level). The CNN with transfer learning requires a conversion tool from time-series datasets to image datasets in preprocessing. First, the CNN time-series classification was verified in the source domain with less than 10\% errors for the variation in water level. Second, the CNN with transfer learning in the target domain efficiently reduced the training time by 1/5 of and a mean error difference by 15\% of those obtained by the CNN without transfer learning, respectively. Our method can provide another novel flood model in addition to physical-based models.},

  abstract = {Large scale smart meter deployments have resulted in popularization of sensor-based electricity forecasting which relies on historical sensor data to infer future energy consumption. Although those approaches have been very successful, they require significant quantities of historical data, often over extended periods of time, to train machine learning models and achieve accurate predictions. New buildings and buildings with newly installed meters have small historical datasets that are insufficient to create accurate predictions. Transfer learning methods have been proposed as a way to use cross-domain datasets to improve predictions. However, these methods do not consider the effects of seasonality within domains. Consequently, this paper proposes Hephaestus, a novel transfer learning method for cross-building energy forecasting based on time series multi-feature regression with seasonal and trend adjustment. This method enables energy prediction with merged data from similar buildings with different distributions and different seasonal profiles. Thus, it improves energy prediction accuracy for a new building with limited data by using datasets from other similar buildings. Hephaestus works in the pre- and post- processing phases and therefore can be used with any standard machine learning algorithm. The case study presented here demonstrates that the proposed approach can improve energy prediction for a school by 11.2\% by using additional data from other schools.},

  abstract = {Modern software systems are built to be used in dynamic environments using configuration capabilities to adapt to changes and external uncertainties. In a self-adaptation context, we are often interested in reasoning about the performance of the systems under different configurations. Usually, we learn a black-box model based on real measurements to predict the performance of the system given a specific configuration. However, as modern systems become more complex, there are many configuration parameters that may interact and we end up learning an exponentially large configuration space. Naturally, this does not scale when relying on real measurements in the actual changing environment. We propose a different solution: Instead of taking the measurements from the real system, we learn the model using samples from other sources, such as simulators that approximate performance of the real system at low cost. We define a cost model that transform the traditional view of model learning into a multi-objective problem that not only takes into account model accuracy but also measurements effort as well. We evaluate our cost-aware transfer learning solution using real-world configurable software including (i) a robotic system, (ii) 3 different stream processing applications, and (iii) a NoSQL database system. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve (a) a high prediction accuracy, as well as (b) a high model reliability.},

For this purpose, historical data can be analyzed to improve demand forecasting by using various methods like machine learning techniques, time series analysis, and deep learning models. In this work, an intelligent demand forecasting system is developed. This improved model is based on the analysis and interpretation of the historical data by using different forecasting methods which include time series analysis techniques, support vector regression algorithm, and deep learning models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to blend the deep learning methodology, support vector regression algorithm, and different time series analysis models by a novel decision integration strategy for demand forecasting approach. The other novelty of this work is the adaptation of boosting ensemble strategy to demand forecasting system by implementing a novel decision integration model. The developed system is applied and tested on real life data obtained from SOK Market in Turkey which operates as a fast-growing company with 6700 stores, 1500 products, and 23 distribution centers. A wide range of comparative and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed demand forecasting system exhibits noteworthy results compared to the state-of-art studies.

We propose a copula model for the joint behavior of prices and wind power production, which is estimated to data from the Danish power market. We find that the marginal behavior of the individual variables is best described by ARMA???GARCH models with non-Gaussian error distributions, and the preferred copula model is a time-varying Gaussian copula. As an application of our joint model, we consider the case of an energy trading company entering into longer-term agreements with wind power producers, where the fluctuating future wind power production is bought at a predetermined fixed price. We find that assuming independence between prices and wind power production leads to an underestimation of risk, as the profit distribution becomes left-skewed when the negative dependence that we find in the data is accounted for. By performing a simple static hedge in the forward market, we show that the risk can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, an out-of-sample study shows that the choice of copula influences the price of correlation risk, and that time-varying copulas are superior to the constant ones when comparing actual profits generated with different models.},

Recently, many regulatory market environments are reorganized to allow short term electricity trading. This study seeks to quantify the benefits of solar forecasting for energy imbalance markets (EIM). State-of-the-art solar forecasts, covering forecast horizons ranging from 24??h to 5??min are proposed and compared against the currently used benchmark models, persistence (P) and smart persistence (SP). The implemented reforecast of numerical weather prediction time series achieves a skill of 14.5\% over the smart persistence model. Using the proposed forecasts for a forecast horizon of up to 75??min for a single 1??MW power plant reduces required flexibility reserves by 21\% and 16.14\%, depending on the allowed trading intervals (5 and 15??min). The probability of an imbalance, caused through wrong market bids from \{PV\} solar plants, can be reduced by 19.65\% and 15.12\% (for 5 and 15??min trading intervals). All \{EIM\} stakeholders benefit from accurate forecasting. Previous estimates on the benefits of EIMs, based on persistence model are conservative. It is shown that the design variables regulating the market time lines, the bidding and the binding schedules, drive the benefits of forecasting.},

Today, users of wind power predictions are not only provided with point predictions, which are estimates of the conditional expectation of the wind generation for each look-ahead time, but also with uncertainty estimates given by probabilistic forecasts. In order to avoid assumptions on the shape of predictive distributions, these probabilistic predictions are produced from non-parametric methods, and then take the form of a single or a set of quantile forecasts. The required and desirable properties of such probabilistic forecasts are defined and a framework for their evaluation is proposed. This framework is applied for evaluating the quality of two statistical methods producing full predictive distributions from point predictions of wind power. These distributions are defined by a number of quantile forecasts with nominal proportions spanning the unit interval. The relevance and interest of the introduced evaluation framework are discussed.

This article analyses the general performance of WPPT as well as its performance during large ramps (swings) in power output. In addition to this, detected large ramps are studied in detail and categorized. WPPT combines wind speed and direction forecasts from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology regional numerical weather prediction model, MesoLAPS, with real-time wind power observations to make hourly forecasts of the wind farm power output. The general performances of MesoLAPS and WPPT are evaluated over 1 year using the root mean square error (RMSE). The errors are significantly lower than for basic benchmark forecasts but higher than for many other WPPT installations, where the site conditions are not as complicated as Woolnorth Bluff Point. Large ramps are considered critical events for a wind power forecast for energy trading as well as managing power system security. A methodology is developed to detect large ramp events in the wind farm power data. Forty-one large ramp events are detected over 1 year and these are categorized according to their predictability by MesoLAPS, the mechanical behaviour of the wind turbine, the power change observed on the grid and the source weather event. During these events, MesoLAPS and WPPT are found to give an RMSE only roughly equivalent to just predicting the mean (climatology forecast). Copyright ?? 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Forecasting the production of photovoltaic (PV) and wind power systems inevitably implies inaccuracies. Therefore, sales made based on forecasts almost always require the vendor to make balancing efforts. In the absence of resources available within their own portfolios, operators can turn towards the intraday market in order to avoid an engagement in the imbalance market with the resulting surcharges and regulatory penalties. In this paper, we combine a novel trade value concept with options valuation and dynamic programming to optimize volume and timing decisions of an individual operator without market power when compensating PV or wind power forecast errors in the market. The model employs a multi-dimensional binomial lattice, with trade value maximized at every node to help formulating bids in view of correlated, uncertain production forecast and price patterns. Inspired by the German electricity market's characteristics, we test the sensitivity of the model's output ? namely trade timing and trade volume ? to changing uncertainty and transaction cost parameters in 50 different setups. It shows that the model effectively outbalances price against volumetric risks. Trades are executed early and with large batch sizes in the case of price volatility. In contrast, increasing forecast error uncertainty leads to trade delays. High transaction costs trigger batch size reductions and ultimately further trade delays. Running 10,000 simulations across ten scenarios, we find that the model translates its flexible trade execution into a competitive advantage vis-?-vis static bidding strategy alternatives.

The most complete information that can be provided today consists of probabilistic forecasts, the resolution of which may be maximized by using meteorological ensemble predictions as input. The paper concentrates on the test case of the Horns Rev wind farm over a period of approximately 1 year, in order to describe, apply and discuss a complete ensemble-based probabilistic forecasting methodology. In a first stage, ensemble forecasts of meteorological variables are converted to power through a suitable power curve model. This model employs local polynomial regression, and is adaptively estimated with an orthogonal fitting method. The obtained ensemble forecasts of wind power are then converted into predictive distributions with an original adaptive kernel dressing method. The shape of the kernels is driven by a mean-variance model, the parameters of which are recursively estimated in order to maximize the overall skill of obtained predictive distributions. Such a methodology has the benefit of yielding predictive distributions that are of increased reliability (in a probabilistic sense) in comparison with the raw ensemble forecasts, at the same time taking advantage of their high resolution.},

Together with the increasing produc- tion of variable renewable energy sources, the intraday market is gaining importance. We inves- tigate the explanatory power of a fundamental modeling approach explicitly accounting for must- run operations of combined heat and power plants (CHP) and intraday peculiarities such as a shortened intraday supply stack. The fundamental equilibria between every hour?s supply stack and aggregated demand in 2012 and 2013 are modeled to yield hourly price estimates. The major benefits of a fundamental modeling approach are the ability to account for non-linearities in the supply stack and the ability to combine time-varying information consistently. The empirical re- sults show that fundamental modeling explains a considerable share of spot price variance. How- ever, differences between the fundamental and actual prices persist and are explored using re- gression models. The main differences can be attributed to (avoided) start up-costs, market states and trading behavior. Keywords: Intraday market for electricity, fundamental price modeling},

We develop perfect and imperfect foresight models with a multi-level structure to investigate the effects of the inability of actors to correctly predict future remuneration on the efficiency of the decisions made by policymakers. The important advantage of the proposed models is that while they are capturing conflicting interests and different information availability of stakeholders involved, they also account for techno-economic constraints on operations of generation, transmission and distribution assets. The presented models can accommodate net metering, value stack, and distribution locational marginal price (DLMP)-based remuneration policies, which allows for their numerical comparison in terms of the effect on the optimal roll-out of distributed energy resources (DERs). The case study carried out for the NYISO and Manhattan T\&D networks reveals that inaccurate foresight on the DER remuneration diminishes the social welfare under all DER remuneration policies, with the maximum loss of 1.6\% across all considered scenarios.},

Traditionally, methods that are developed and implemented are point forecasting methods, i.e. they provide a single estimated value for a given horizon. As errors are unavoidable, several research teams have recently proposed uncertainty estimation methods in order to optimize the decision-making process (reserve quantification, bidding strategy definition, etc.). Here, focus is given to methods that quote quantiles or intervals from predictive distributions of wind generation. The paper describes what the required properties of appropriate uncertainty estimation methods are and how they can be evaluated.

Accurate forecasts of wind generation are therefore paramount for reducing such penalties and thus maximizing revenue. Despite the fact that increasing accuracy in spot forecasts may reduce penalties, this paper shows that, if such forecasts are accompanied with information on their uncertainty, i.e., in the form of predictive distributions, then this can be the basis for defining advanced strategies for market participation. Such strategies permit to further increase revenues and thus enhance competitiveness of wind generation compared to other forms of dispatchable generation. This paper formulates a general methodology for deriving optimal bidding strategies based on probabilistic forecasts of wind generation, as well as on modeling of the sensitivity a wind power producer may have to regulation costs. The benefits resulting from the application of these strategies are clearly demonstrated on the test case of the participation of a multi-MW wind farm in the Dutch electricity market over a year.},

We have also focused on the use probabilistic wind power forecasts in electricity markets. We have investigated the representation of wind power forecasting uncertainty in the unit commitment problem. Traditional deterministic unit commitment models use a point forecast for wind power output. In contrast, we have developed a stochastic alternative that represents forecast uncertainty by using scenarios that capture cross-temporal dependencies in the predicted wind power. Furthermore, we have investigated the use of probabilistic wind power forecasts to estimate dynamic operating reserve requirements. We have tested the new algorithms on several case studies on a small-scale hypothetical power system as well as on realistic data for the power system of Illinois. A comparison of a diversity of unit commitment and operating reserve strategies illustrate the potential advantages of using probabilistic forecasts in the scheduling of energy and operating reserves compared to the traditional deterministic approach. We have also developed a model for optimal trading of wind power under uncertainty in wind power and prices. The model has been tested on several case studies on both hypothetical and real-world data. The results show that the model can control the trade-offs between risk and return for wind farm owners depending on their risk preferences.

Distribution regression predicts cdf probabilities instead of quantile dependent variable levels. Has same crossing problems as quantile regression, but may be better for extreme quantiles (if somehow coverted to them). This is the original distribution regression paper. As far as I can tell, it's clearer than the later papers. For ReWP, and other post-bidding operations like redispatch, where a fixed level of power has already been promised, Distributional regression could be more appropriate than quantile regression: you pick a level, and DR tells you the probability that it will be exceeded. This could be used for intraday correction of DA forecasts, or reserve activation. Prediction is done best w/ an additive logistic regression model (on trading test), but it's not clear that logistic regression is necessarily the best method. Anyway crossover is an issue w/ this method, just as w/ quantile regression. DR vs. QR * quantile regression: given a c.d.f. probability, predict the value of the dependent variable * distribution regression: given a value of a dependent variable, predict the c.d.f. probability * Performance (from Koenker13DistributionalvsQuantile) - DR perf. QR perf, but DR might be better in extremes: - both QR and DR have crossover problems (they give up on it in this paper) Predicting the c.d.f. probabilities * given a level threshold, create a binary indicator vector w/ a 1 where the dep. var. is {\textexclamdown}= the threshold * try to predict the indicator using the independent variables, x * prediction done w/ variants of logistic regression - predicts the mean value of indicator - the mean value prediction, not the distribution assumed by logistic regression, is the goal * use many thresholds * Result: for every test, x, you get a set of predicted cdf probs at a constant set of levels * somehow build an ordered c.d.f. out of this (can have crossover) - think you could turn probs into quantiles byr training a model that uses an (x,prob) input to predict the levels * Simple logistic regression details can be found in, for example: Shalizi15datAnalElemViewBk * but I don't think that logistic regression matters: could be an NN if it's using RMSE training * it is not clear to me how the cdf probs are used in their studies, however!! Logistic regression models: 3 types tested 1. linear logistic regression - best on squared prediction error metrics - not best on trading simulation b/c of transaction costs from frequent trading 2. additive logistic ref. model, which can accommodate splines - 2{$^{nd}$} best on pred. error - clearly the best in trading experiment 3. semi-additive L.R. - generally doesn't work Crossover avoidance approaches (in cdf invversion) 1. Do nothing - montonicity not guaranteed - max quantile prob {\textexclamdown}= 1 2. Ordered logit - monotonicity guaranteed - 0 {\textexclamdown}= quantile prob {\textexclamdown}=1 guaranteed - too restrictive, only models location shift (but see location+shift model in Koenker13DistributionalvsQuantile ?) 3. Probability spacing - monotonicity guaranteed - max prob {\textexclamdown}=1 not guaranteed -- Schmidt13noCrossQRspacing does spacing but this works b/c they're spacing quantiles, which aren't bounded 4. Survivor recursion - montonicity guaranteed - 0 {\textexclamdown}= p {\textexclamdown}=1 guaranteed - not interpretable (and hard to estimate?). - but maybe this is no less interpretable than a NN?

  abstract = {In the wind industry, a power curve refers to the functional relationship between the power output generated by a wind turbine and the wind speed at the time of power generation. Power curves are used in practice for a number of important tasks including predicting wind power production and assessing a turbine's energy production efficiency. Nevertheless, actual wind power data indicate that the power output is affected by more than just wind speed. Several other environmental factors, such as wind direction, air density, humidity, turbulence intensity, and wind shears, have potential impact. Yet, in industry practice, as well as in the literature, current power curve models primarily consider wind speed and, sometimes, wind speed and direction. We propose an additive multivariate kernel method that can include the aforementioned environmental factors as a new power curve model. Our model provides, conditional on a given environmental condition, both the point estimation and density estimation of power output. It is able to capture the nonlinear relationships between environmental factors and the wind power output, as well as the high-order interaction effects among some of the environmental factors. Using operational data associated with four turbines in an inland wind farm and two turbines in an offshore wind farm, we demonstrate the improvement achieved by our kernel method.

Existing literature has less research on the internal mechanism and alternative process of renewable energy price policies' evolution process. In view of this, this paper innovatively introduces the classic model of innovation diffusion theory, the Bass model, into the renewable energy price mechanism, and improves it on the basis of the traditional Bass model, and then proposes a system dynamics (SD) simulation based on the improved Bass model to study the evolution process of the renewable energy price policies. This paper mainly studies the evolution process of the policies from feed-in tariff (FIT) to renewable portfolio standard (RPS), and takes China's wind power industry as an example to simulate the model. The results show that FIT can effectively and quickly evolve to RPS based on the internal influence of the interaction among power generation enterprises and the external influence of government behaviors. All the power generation enterprises will implement RPS, and the amount of green power enterprises eventually grows steadily and slowly. In addition, increasing the decline rate of FIT subsidy and RPS unit fine can effectively promote the evolution of RPS policy, and also improve the amount of green power enterprises and the activity of the tradable green certificates (TGC) trading market.

  abstract = {Many countries and regions are introducing policies aimed at reducing the environmental footprint from the energy sector and increasing the use of renewable energy. In the United States, a number of initiatives have been taken at the state level, from renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) and renewable energy certificates (RECs), to regional greenhouse gas emission control schemes. Within the U.S. Federal government, new energy and environmental policies and goals are also being crafted, and these are likely to increase the use of renewable energy substantially. The European Union is pursuing implementation of its ambitious 20/20/20 targets, which aim (by 2020) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20\% (as compared to 1990), increase the amount of renewable energy to 20\% of the energy supply, and reduce the overall energy consumption by 20\% through energy efficiency. With the current focus on energy and the environment, efficient integration of renewable energy into the electric power system is becoming increasingly important. In a recent report, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) describes a model-based scenario, in which wind energy provides 20\% of the U.S. electricity demand in 2030. The report discusses a set of technical and economic challenges that have to be overcome for this scenario to unfold. In Europe, several countries already have a high penetration of wind power (i.e., in the range of 7 to 20\% of electricity consumption in countries such as Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark). The rapid growth in installed wind power capacity is expected to continue in the United States as well as in Europe. A large-scale introduction of wind power causes a number of challenges for electricity market and power system operators who will have to deal with the variability and uncertainty in wind power generation when making their scheduling and dispatch decisions. Wind power forecasting (WPF) is frequently identified as an important tool to address the variability and uncertainty in wind power and to more efficiently operate power systems with large wind power penetrations. Moreover, in a market environment, the wind power contribution to the generation portofolio becomes important in determining the daily and hourly prices, as variations in the estimated wind power will influence the clearing prices for both energy and operating reserves. With the increasing penetration of wind power, WPF is quickly becoming an important topic for the electric power industry. System operators (SOs), generating companies (GENCOs), and regulators all support efforts to develop better, more reliable and accurate forecasting models. Wind farm owners and operators also benefit from better wind power prediction to support competitive participation in electricity markets against more stable and dispatchable energy sources. In general, WPF can be used for a number of purposes, such as: generation and transmission maintenance planning, determination of operating reserve requirements, unit commitment, economic dispatch, energy storage optimization (e.g., pumped hydro storage), and energy trading. The objective of this report is to review and analyze state-of-the-art WPF models and their application to power systems operations. We first give a detailed description of the methodologies underlying state-of-the-art WPF models. We then look at how WPF can be integrated into power system operations, with specific focus on the unit commitment problem.

  abstract = {Major recent changes in electricity markets relate to the process for their deregulation, along with increasing participation of renewable (stochastic) generation e.g. wind power. Our general objective is to model how feedback, competition and stochasticity (on the production side) interact in electricity markets, and eventually assess what their effects are on both the participants and the society. For this, day ahead electricity markets are modeled as dynamic closed loop systems, in which the feedback signal is the market price. In parallel, the Cournot competition model is considered. Mixed portfolios with significant share of renewable energy are based on stochastic threshold cost functions. Regarding trading strategies, it is assumed that generators are looking at optimizing their individual profits. The point of view of the society is addressed by analyzing market behavior and stability. The performed simulations show the beneficial effects of employing long term bidding strategies for both generators and society. Sensitivity analyses are performed in order to evaluate the effects of demand elasticity. It is shown that increase in demand elasticity reduces the possibility for the generators to exploit their market power. Furthermore, the results suggest that introduction of wind power generation in the market is beneficial both for the generators and the society.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic wind power forecast has gained increasing importance in the recent years. The advantages of probabilistic information, for the integration of wind power to the electrical network, are discussed in numerous publications which mainly address advantages in energy trading and electricity network regulation. The value of the probabilistic wind power forecast is based on the spread of wind power forecast members originating either from a number of NWP models or ensem- ble products of global models (such as ECMWF, UKMO, Meteo France, NCEP and others). Wind power members provide an estimate of the expected uncertainty of power predictions. However, calibration is needed for reliable probabilistic information that is consistent with observations. The paper addresses the development and assesses the quality of the 100m ECMWF EPS (ensemble prediction system winds) which were introduced by ECMWF beginning of 2010 in two operational wind farms (onshore and onshore). In addition, the paper compares differerent calibration method- ologies of Ensembles (in wind and in wind power mode) and addresses the implications for the operational environment. Results show that the probabilistic calibration methodologies examined in wind power mode success- fully optimise the quantiles ranging from 10\% to 90\% with some outliers outside of these limits, mainly due to limited amount of available observational data. The paper compares the different approaches by means of resolution, sharpness, reliability and skill score. We address the training window of the calibration methodologies in the operational forecast environment and show that sim- ple models x yield equivalent accurate results in the operational forecast environment with training periods of less than a month compared with more complex models with longer training periods. Ensembles that have been calibrated in wind mode ((u,v) components at the same time) are still well calibrated when transformed into wind power and show good improvements in probabilistic skill compared to the raw ensemble. The benefit from calibration is less when verification is done with observed wind power instead of using simulated wind power for Germany. The spread of the calibrated ensemble is underestimated with respect to real observations mostly because},

This paper presents an advanced statistical method for solar power forecasting based on artificial intelligence techniques. The method requires as input past power measurements and meteorological forecasts of solar irradiance, relative humidity and temperature at the site of the photovoltaic power system. A self-organized map (SOM) is trained to classify the local weather type of 24 h ahead provided by the online meteorological services. A unique feature of the method is that following a preliminary weather type classification, the neural networks can be well trained to improve the forecast accuracy. The proposed method is suitable for operational planning of transmission system operator, i.e. forecasting horizon of 24 h ahead and for PV power system operators trading in electricity markets. Application of the forecasting method on the power production of an actual PV power system shows the validity of the method.

Alternative approaches for the use of probabilistic forecasting are introduced. More precisely, focus is given to prediction risk indices aiming to give a comprehensive signal on the expected level of forecast uncertainty. Ensemble predictions of wind generation are used as input. A proposal for the definition of prediction risk indices is given. Such skill forecasts are based on the spread of ensemble forecasts (i.e. a set of alternative scenarios for the coming period) for a single prediction horizon or over a look-ahead period. It is shown on the test case of a Danish offshore wind farm how these prediction risk indices may be related to several levels of forecast uncertainty (and potential energy imbalances). Wind power ensemble predictions are derived from the conversion of ECMWF and NCEP ensemble forecasts of meteorological variables to wind power ensemble forecasts, as well as by a lagged average approach alternative. The ability of prediction risk indices calculated from the various types of ensembles forecasts to resolve among situations with different levels of uncertainty is discussed.},

For an optimal management of the building energy, a Model Predictive Control is generally used but requires an accurate building model and weather forecast.

Hourly solar irradiations are forecasted for time horizons from h+1 to h+6. The random forest method (RF) is the most efficient and the accuracy of forecasts are in term of nRMSE, from 19.65\% for h+1 to 27.78\% for h+6 for global horizontal irradiation, from 34.11\% for h+1 to 49.08\% for h+6 for beam normal irradiation, from 35.08\% for h+1 to 49.14\% for h+6 for diffuse horizontal irradiation. The improvement brought by the use of RF compared to the two other methods increases with the forecasting horizon.

However, this additional informationmay be paramount for a large class of time-dependent and multi-stage decision-making problems e.g. optimal operation of combined wind-storage systems or multiple-market trading with different gate closures. This issue is addressed here by describing a method that permits the generation of statistical scenarios of short-term wind generation that accounts for both the interdependence structure of prediction errors and the predictive distributions of wind power production. The method is based on the conversion of series of prediction errors to a multivariate Gaussian random variable, the interdependence structure of which can then be summarized by a unique covariance matrix. Such matrix is recursively estimated in order to accommodate long-term variations in the prediction error characteristics.

One of the central questions to be answered is how efficient does a balance responsible party have to be to stay competitive also with a small pool.

Additionally, we analyse and show the requirement and the monetary value of Intra-Day trading for the handling of wind and solar power.

  abstract = {The introduction of the quarter-hourly intraday auction in 2014 for the German market confirms a tendency towards short-term energy markets. The reason for the new market was the need to trade shorter periods than just hours a day-ahead to minimize open positions in the more volatile continuous intraday trading. The increased production capacity of solar power boosted this requirement for new short-term power products. The quarter-hourly market shows a distinctive zigzag price formation. We identify two influencing factors: first, the solar residual that combines the trading of solar power ramps around midday as well as the gradients of consumption and thermal power plant ramps throughout the course of the day, and second, a characteristic two stage market design with higher liquidity for the hourly than for the quarter-hourly auction. Therefore, demand, solar generation and inflexible ramps of thermal power plants are hedged at the hourly day-ahead auction and use the quarter-hourly auction only to balance the remaining differences. To prove this argument the price sensitivities of the hourly day-ahead and quarter-hourly intraday auctions in Germany are compared based on actual bid and ask curves from 2015 and 2016. Finally, the development of an adequate design of future spot markets is discussed.ZusammenfassungDie Einf{\"u}hrung der viertelst{\"u}ndlichen Intraday-Auktion im Jahre 2014 f{\"u}r den deutschen Strommarkt untermauert die Bedeutung der kurzfristigen Energiem{\"a}rkte.

  abstract = {The increasing production of renewable energy, and in particular wind energy, introduces highly volatile sources of energy in the total production. This implies that methods for reliable probabilistic forecasts of future wind power production are essential. Today there exist numerous methods and tools for providing point forecasts of wind power generation. However, for efficient and safe regulation, and for harvesting optimal trading strategies reliable information on the uncertainty is also needed. In this paper we focus on forecasts on the 1-48 hour horizon. It is well-known that the form of the conditional density for the wind power production is highly dependent on the level of predicted wind power in addition to the prediction horizon. This paper describes a new approach for wind power forecasting based on state dependent stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Specifically we will use a logistic type stochastic differential equation to account for the natural restrictions (wind power cannot exceed installed capacity and cannot be below zero). The SDE is driven by a widely used point predictor for wind power forecast, and the SDE formulation allows us to calculate both state dependent conditional uncertainties as well as correlation structures. Evaluation and optimization of the model is obtained by evaluating the likelihood of a 48-dimensional random vector when accounting for the correlation structure defined by the SDE-formulation. We explore the correlation parameters and skewness of the model and input-variables (prediction horizon and point predictions), by a non-parametric (spline based) model for the parameters. Keywords: nonlinear forecasting, state space model, stochastic differential equations, wind power prediction.},

  title = {A Limit Order Book Model for the German Intraday Electricity Market},
  author = {Martin, Henry},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {The importance of the German intraday electricity market increased significantly over the past years, however there is limited research about intraday market models in Germany. In this thesis we examine the possibility of applying limit order book market models designed for stock markets to the German intraday electricity market. We find that the general approach may be suitable for modeling characteristics like liquidity, but that the specific models are a poor fit. Therefore we propose new models that are tailored to our application. We proceed by preparing the EPEX SPOT M7 order flow data, a data set containing all orders submitted to the German intraday electricity market. We present prepro- cessing steps and decision rules necessary to infer the identity of individual orders, information that is not directly available. Based on these rules, we implement a historical market simulator that reconstructs the complete state of the market for every point in time. The historic market simulator itself can be used as a simple, limit order book based market model. It allows modeling the influence of trade size and trading time on the available market price. Thus, this model can, when limited to small trade sizes, represent important dimensions of liquidity. We find that the historical EPEX SPOT order flow simulator can reproduce independent transaction records with a near-exact accuracy. The order flow is then used to create a stochastic market model. First, we introduce a horizon dependent power law model for the order submission intensity, which provides a very good fit to empirical data. We show that trading size is strongly clustered around integers, and propose a mixture model that can reproduce the preference of traders for rounded values. Order cancellation arrival intensity is indirectly modeled by a distribution of order lifetimes. We show that order lifetime does not follow the exponential distribution used for stock markets so we instead model it using a log-logistic model. Finally, we simulate the market model for the last two hours of trading for one month of unseen test data. For most of the variables, the simulated outcome matches the time independent distributions of the empirical data. The fit is especially close for the order arrival rate, order prices, the mid-price, the price at the best ask and the price of the best bid.},

  abstract = {The field of time-series analysis has made important contributions to a wide spectrum of ap- plications such as tide-level studies in hydrology, natural resource prospecting in geo-statistics, speech recognition, weather forecasting, financial trading, and economic forecasts and analy- sis. Nevertheless, the analysis of the non-Gaussian and non-stationary features of time-series remains challenging for the current state-of-art models. This thesis proposes an innovative framework that leverages the theory of copula, combined with a probabilistic framework from the machine learning community, to produce a versatile tool for multiple time-series analysis. I coined this new model Kernel-based Copula Processes (KCPs). Under the new proposed framework, various idiosyncracies can be modeled compactly via a kernel function for each individual time-series, and long-range dependency can be cap- tured by a copula function. The copula function separates the marginal behavior and serial dependency structures, thus allowing them to be modeled separately and with much greater flexibility. Moreover, the codependent structure of a large number of time-series with poten- tially vastly different characteristics can be captured in a compact and elegant fashion through the notion of a binding copula. This feature allows a highly heterogeneous model to be built, breaking free from the homogeneous limitation of most conventional models. The KCPs have demonstrated superior predictive power when used to forecast a multitude of data sets from meteorological and financial areas. Finally, the versatility of the KCP model is exemplified when it was successfully applied to non-trivial classification problems unaltered.},

  abstract = {The uncertainty of wind power forecasts generally decreases with forecast horizon, making it possible to profitably sell large amounts of this power on a day-ahead interday market, and then to make small corrections closer to delivery time by trading on a short-horizon intraday market. Such multistage intraday buy/sell decisions are often made using deterministic power forecasts, even though probabilistic forecasts describe the highly relevant uncertainty vs. time relationship. This is especially true for German transmission system operators (TSOs), who are allowed to consider only the expected value -- i.e. a point forecast -- when selling on the interday market, and who have other restrictions on the intraday market. Simulations suggest that certain German TSOs, or direct marketers which have smaller installed capacities, may benefit on the intraday market by trading while using probabilistic forecasts. A much larger benefit may also accrue with the use of a price forecast, also developed for this work. One limitation this study is that the market model used may have the effect of smoothing out price volatility and illiquidity. A next step is to re-evaluate probabilistic trading on a market model which simulates such illiquidity.

We investigate the bidding behaviour in the intraday market by looking at both last prices and continuous bidding, in the context of a fundamental model. A unique data set of 15-minute intraday prices and intraday-updated forecasts of wind and photovoltaic has been employed and price bids are modelled by prior information on fundamentals. We show that intraday prices adjust asymmetrically to both forecasting errors in renewables and to the volume of trades dependent on the threshold variable demand quote, which reflects the expected demand covered by the planned traditional capacity in the day-ahead market. The location of the threshold can be used by market participants to adjust their bids accordingly, given the latest updates in the wind and photovoltaic forecasting errors and the forecasts of the control area},

The empirical results from different regression analysis with data from 2010 and 2011 show that most price determinants increase and decrease intraday prices as expected.

Different copulas are applied in order to model the complex dependence structure between the return series of carbon emission allowance prices and those of various commodities as well as other financial series. As suggested in the literature, the use of correlation as the only measure of dependence can lead to an underestimation of the risk of joint extreme price movements. What is more, copula models represent a more flexible method for deriving the nature of dependence and provide an appropriate fit also for the tails of multivariate distributions. The findings suggest that the relationship between EU emission allowance (EUA) future returns and those of the other commodities - in particular gas and oil markets - is relatively weak. However, we find some dependence between EUA futures and equity or energy index returns. These results at least somehow contradict earlier studies that report no statistically significant or even negative correlations between returns of emission allowances and other financial variables. Regarding the nature of dependence, we also find some evidence of weak symmetric tail dependence for most of the considered series.

We apply probabilistic kernel density forecasting with a quantile-copula estimator to forecast the probability density function, from which forecasting quantiles and scenarios with temporal dependency of errors are derived. We show how the probabilistic forecasts can be used to schedule energy and operating reserves to accommodate the wind power forecast uncertainty. We simulate the operation of a two-settlement electricity market with clearing of day-ahead and real-time markets for energy and operating reserves. At the day-ahead stage, a deterministic point forecast is input to the commitment and dispatch procedure. Then a probabilistic forecast is used to adjust the commitment status of fast-starting units closer to real time, on the basis of either dynamic operating reserves or stochastic unit commitment. Finally, the real-time dispatch is based on the realized availability of wind power. To evaluate the model in a large-scale real-world setting, we take the power system in Illinois as a test case and compare different scheduling strategies. The results show better performance for dynamic compared with fixed operating reserve requirements. Furthermore, although there are differences in the detailed dispatch results, dynamic operating reserves and stochastic unit commitment give similar results in terms of cost. Overall, we find that probabilistic forecasts can contribute to improve the performance of the power system, both in terms of cost and reliability.},

  abstract = {This document will give the reader an introduction to the German power market. The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview over the market rules and products at the German wholesale and ancillary service markets. The wholesale power market is introduced in chapter 3. The basic principles of electricity trading on derivative and spot markets are similar to other commodity markets. Commodity trading is typical for metals, coal, agricultural products, crude oil and natural gas. The purpose of derivative market is to hedge risks against unforeseen price developments. The seller of a commodity agrees upfront to pay a price for a specified good at a specified delivery date and the seller agrees to deliver the good at the specified time. These deals can be closed at exchanges or bilaterally between the buyer and the seller, the so-called over-the-counter trade (OTC). The European Energy Exchange (EEX) operates the power derivative market for the market area Germany. An introduction to the derivative markets is given in chapter 3.2 and to OTC trading in chapter 3.3. A closer matching of supply and demand occurs on short-term spot markets that are operated by EPEX SPOT for the German market area. Spot markets establish power prices for every hour and even for every quarter of an hour. Chapter 3.1 introduces to the EPEX SPOT market. However forecast of generation and consumption are not perfect but supply and demand must be in balance every time to keep a constant frequency. For this reason the TSOs procure ancillary services and especially frequency control reserve. Control reserve is an extra market that enables market participants to provide services. This market is explained in chapter 4. On the other hand, imbalances of a market participant are charged with a balancing energy price. The organisational framework of market participants and the charging of imbalances are introduced in chapter 1.},

An efficient use of the fluctuating solar power production will highly benefit from forecast information on the expected power production, as a basis for management of the electricity grids and trading on the energy market. We present and evaluate the regional PV power prediction system of University of Oldenburg and Meteocontrol GmbH providing forecasts of up to 2 days ahead with hourly resolution. The proposed approach is based on forecasts of the global model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF). It includes a post-processing procedure to derive optimised, site-specific irradiance forecasts and explicit physical modelling steps to convert the predicted irradiances to PV power. Finally, regional power forecasts are derived by up-scaling from a representative set of PV systems. The investigation of proper up-scaling is a special focus of this paper. We introduce a modified up-scaling approach, modelling the spatial distribution of the nominal power with a resolution of 18 18. The operational PV power prediction system is evaluated in comparison to the modified up-scaling approach for the control areas of the two German transmission system operators ?transpower? and ?50 Hertz? for the period 2.7.2009?30.4.2010. rmse values of the operational forecasts are in the range of 4?5\% with respect to the nominal power for intra-day and day-ahead forecast horizons.

To solve these issues, we propose a physics-driven Deep Neural Network (PhDNN) for solving non-linear inverse problems. In this framework, the physical forward model is utilized to produce a data misfit. Both the model misfit and data misfit are used to train the network. As an example, we use this framework to solve a geosteering problem which enables the drilling direction adjusted by collected resistivity well logging measurements.

The model results allow two main conclusions: The competitive fringe is not trading on exchanges in Denmark and France but in Germany. The second conclusion is that the high observed volumes in auction-based intraday markets cannot be explained by fundamentals or the auction-based design but are mainly caused by market peculiarities.

The relevance of commonly used liquidity indicators like the bid ask-spread, resiliency, market depth, price variance, delay and search costs as well as trading volume and the number of trades are analyzed with respect to both models of liquidity.

German EPEX Intraday market doesn't behave in the fundamental/merit order economist sense because traders are not risk averse, and will delay trading to get a better deal, increasing liquidity (I think). Study discusses several metrics for market liquidity and then deduces how they would behave under classic, "fundamental" assumption and under a more complicated "trader model." It then checks the metrics to see which assumption is more likely to be true; it is overwhelmingly the trader model. The dimensions of liquidity and their correlations might be good for a price forecast, since low liquidity prediction for the future would suggest that the price will go up if you buy a lot of electricity. If TSO's can't consider price, they still must consider market liquidity in intraday market. This is a paper about that, and maybe that will lead to a "liquidity" forecast (trade when you forecast that enough electricity will be available, or maybe make this decision on every step). If do this, then will have to also figure out what the true TSO forecast was (not normalized) and must somehow remove that from the historical data.

Nevertheless, wind power producers are increasingly urged to participate in electricity market auctions in the same manner as conventional power producers. The aim of this paper is to propose an operational strategy for trading wind energy in liberalized electricity markets and to assess its performance. At first, the so-called optimal quantile strategy is revisited. It is proved that without market power, i.e. under the price-taker assumption, this strategy maximizes expected market revenues. Forecasts of wind power production, of day-ahead and real-time market prices and of the system imbalance are inputs to this strategy. Subsequently, constraining of the bid that maximizes the expected revenues is proposed as a way to overcome the strategy's disregard of practical limitations and, at the same time, of risk. Two constraining techniques are introduced: constraining in the decision space and in the probability space. Finally, the trade of a wind power producer is simulated in a test case for the Eastern Danish (DK-2) price area of the Nordic Power Exchange (Nord Pool) during a 10 month period in 2008. The results of the test case show the financial benefits of the aforementioned strategy as well as the consequent interaction with the electricity market.

  abstract = {We consider the problem of optimal trading for a power producer in the context of intraday electricity markets. The aim is to minimize the imbalance cost induced by the random residual demand in electricity, i.e. the consumption from the clients minus the production from renewable energy. For a simple linear price impact model and a quadratic criterion, we explicitly obtain approximate optimal strategies in the intraday market and thermal power generation, and exhibit some remarkable properties of the trading rate.

  abstract = {We provide a new dynamic approach to scenario generation for the purposes of risk management in the banking industry. We connect ideas from conventional techniques -- like historical and Monte Carlo simulation -- and we come up with a hybrid method that shares the advantages of standard procedures but eliminates several of their drawbacks. Instead of considering the static problem of constructing one or ten day ahead distributions for vectors of risk factors, we embed the problem into a dynamic framework, where any time horizon can be consistently simulated. Additionally, we use standard models from mathematical finance for each risk factor, whence bridging the worlds of trading and risk management. Our approach is based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), like the HJM-equation or the Black-Scholes equation, governing the time evolution of risk factors, on an empirical calibration method to the market for the chosen SDEs, and on an Euler scheme (or high-order schemes) for the numerical evaluation of the respective SDEs. The empirical calibration procedure presented in this paper can be seen as the SDE-counterpart of the so called Filtered Historical Simulation method; the behavior of volatility stems in our case out of the assumptions on the underlying SDEs. Furthermore, we are able to easily incorporate "middle-size" and "large-size" events within our framework always making a precise distinction between the information obtained from the market and the one coming from the necessary a-priori intuition of the risk manager. Results of one concrete implementation are provided.},

The verification framework is based on visual diagnostic tools and a set of scoring rules mostly originating from the weather forecast verification community. Two types of probabilistic forecasts are used as a basis to illustrate the ap- plication of these verification approaches. The first one consists in ensemble forecasts commonly provided by national or international meteorological centres. The second one originates from statistical methods and pro- duces a set of discrete quantile forecasts, the nominal proportions of which span the unit interval. These probabilistic forecasts are evaluated for two selected sites that experience very different climatic conditions. The first site is located in the continental US while the second one is situated on La R{\'e}union Island. Although visual diagnostic tools can help identify deficiencies in generated forecasts, it is recommended that a set of numerical scores be used to assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts. In particular, the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) seems to have all the features needed to evaluate a probabilistic forecasting system and, as such, may become a standard for verifying solar irradiance probabilistic forecasts and by extension probabilistic forecasts of solar power generation.},

Useful for ReWP pool selection: having only computed a small number of pairwise covariances, can compute the variance of the sum of any pool. Since forecasting accuracy improves with decreasing variance this is an approximate way to select a pool with the best forecastability. Could verify this by looking at the empirical results of EERA DTOC, and seeing if this approximation is true on that data. The idea would be: 1.) compute pairwise FORECAST ERROR covariances of all farms 2.) for a given power target compute all power sum combinations that produce enough power (at some quantile?) 3.) find the cost of power from all power sum combinations 4.) find the error variance for all combinations (computationally cheap) For all combos satisfying 2.) somehow start from lowest cost/lowest error variance combination. Possibly compute the real quantile forecast. If it fails to meet the power target, compute the sum forecast for the next best combination. Repeat until satisfied. Or something... is related to Jan's PhD thesis forecastability stuff, and to EERA DTOC.

In this paper, we extend the stochastic conditional duration (SCD) model to capture the pattern of intraday trading intervals and propose a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate this intraday seasonality simultaneously. To efficiently generate the Monte Carlo sample, we used a hybrid of the Gibbs/Metropolis--Hastings (MH) sampling scheme and also applied generalized Gibbs sampling. In addition to capturing this intraday seasonality, this paper also considers limit order book information. Three-day tick data for three stocks obtained from Nikkei NEEDS are used for estimation, and model selection is performed on smooth parameters, Weibull distribution and Gamma distribution. The typical intraday regularity of frequent trading immediately after the start of trading is confirmed, and the spread of the limit order book information is also found to affect the trading time interval.},

  abstract = {Since the deregulation of the power markets, accurate short term Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) has become crucial in maximizing economic benefits and mitigating power market risks. Due to the challenging characteristics of electricity price, which comprise high volatility, rapid spike, and seasonality, developing robust machine learning prediction tools becomes cumbersome. This work proposes a new hybrid machine learning method for a day-ahead EPF, which involves linear regression Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) and ensemble bagging Extra Tree Regression (ETR) models. Considering that each model of EPF has its own strengths and weaknesses, combining several models gives more accurate predictions and overcomes the limitations of an individual model. Therefore, the linear ARD model is applied because it can efficiently deal with trend and seasonality variations; on the other hand, the ensemble ETR model is employed to learn from interactions, and thus combining ARD with ETR produces robust forecasting outcomes. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated using a data set from the Nord Pool electricity market. The proposed model is compared with other models to demonstrate its superiority using performance matrices, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves lower forecasting errors than other individual and hybrid models. Additionally, a comparative study has been performed against previous works, where forecasting measurement of the proposed method outperforms previous works' accuracy in forecasting electricity price.},

It finds there is a meritorder effect from wind and solar PV power at most times of the day, which varies in magnitude for each of the 24 h. Electricity production from wind power is also found to play a clear role in increasing price volatility at all hours. Electricity inflow is shown to decrease both the mean and volatility of the electricity prices. The volatility of electricity prices is revealed to be highly persistent, and thus prone to large transmission shocks. This volatility is also susceptible to new shocks, which may indicate a tendency by market participants to overreact to unexpected shocks in electricity prices, possibly due to the relatively small size of the Iberian electricity market.},

Wind and PV uncertainty is modeled based on spatial-temporal trajectories, while a convex hull technique to define uncertainty sets for the model is used. A case study based on real generation data allows illustration and discussion of the properties of the model.

Given its computational complexity, several optimization-based methods have been proposed to lighten the full unit commitment formulation by removing redundant line flow constraints. These approaches often ignore the spatial couplings of multi-side renewable generation and demand. To address this pitfall, we rule out redundant constraints over a tightened linear programming relaxation of the original unit commitment feasibility region by adding a constraint that efficiently models the correlation of residual demand variations. We set forth a novel, tractable and robust polyhedral uncertainty envelope induced by a given set of scenarios to characterize the tightening constraint. We propose a data-driven umbrella constraint discovery problem formulation that substantially increase the network constraints filtration in unit commitment. Numerical tests are performed on standard IEEE test networks to substantiate the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract = {The technical virtual power plant (TVPP) is a promising paradigm to facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) while incorporating operational constraints of both DERs and networks. Due to the volatility and limited predictability of DER generation and electric loads, the output capability of the TVPP is uncertain. In this regard, this paper proposes the robust capability curve (RCC) of the TVPP, which explicitly characterizes the allowable range of the scheduled power output that is executable for the TVPP under uncertainties. Implementing the RCC can secure the scheduling of the TVPP against unexpected fluctuations of operating conditions when the TVPP participates in the transmission-level dispatch. Mathematically, the RCC is the first-stage feasible set of an adjustable robust optimization problem. An uncertainty set model incorporating the variable correlation and uncertainty budget is employed, which makes the robustness and conservatism of the RCC adjustable. A novel methodology is proposed to estimate the RCC by the convex hull of several points on its perimeter. These perimeter points are obtained by solving a series of multi scenario-optimal power flow problems with worst-case uncertainty realizations identified based on a linearized network configuration. Case studies based on the IEEE-13 test feeder validate the effectiveness of the RCC to ensure the scheduling feasibility while hedging against uncertainties. The computational efficiency of the proposed RCC estimation method is also verified based on larger-scale test systems.},

However, the intermittency and stochasticity of these renewable resources bring significant challenges to the reliable and economic operation of power systems. Motivated by these challenges, we present a multistage adaptive robust optimization model for the unit commitment (UC) problem, which models the sequential nature of the dispatch process and utilizes a new type of dynamic uncertainty sets to capture the temporal and spatial correlations of wind and solar power. The model also considers the operation of energy storage devices. We propose a simplified and effective affine policy for dispatch decisions, and develop an efficient algorithmic framework using a combination of constraint generation and duality-based reformulation with various improvements. Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed method can efficiently solve multistage robust UC problems on the Polish 2736-bus system under high dimensional uncertainty of 60 wind farms and 30 solar farms. The computational results also suggest that the proposed model leads to significant benefits in both costs and reliability over robust models with traditional uncertainty sets as well as deterministic models with reserve rules.},

  abstract = {Abstract Probabilistic forecasts in the form of ensembles of scenarios are required for complex decision-making processes. Ensemble forecasting systems provide such products but the spatiotemporal structures of the forecast uncertainty is lost when statistical calibration of the ensemble forecasts is applied for each lead time and location independently. Nonparametric approaches allow the reconstruction of spatiotemporal joint probability distributions at a small computational cost. For example, the ensemble copula coupling (ECC) method rebuilds the multivariate aspect of the forecast from the original ensemble forecasts. Based on the assumption of error stationarity, parametric methods aim to fully describe the forecast dependence structures. In this study, the concept of ECC is combined with past data statistics in order to account for the autocorrelation of the forecast error. The new approach, called d-ECC, is applied to wind forecasts from the high-resolution Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) ensemble prediction system (EPS) run operationally at the German Weather Service (COSMO-DE-EPS). Scenarios generated by ECC and d-ECC are compared and assessed in the form of time series by means of multivariate verification tools and within a product-oriented framework. Verification results over a 3-month period show that the innovative method d-ECC performs as well as or even outperforms ECC in all investigated aspects.},

  abstract = {One of the main goals of current systems neuroscience is to understand how neuronal populations integrate sensory information to inform behavior. However, estimating stimulus or behavioral information that is encoded in high-dimensional neuronal populations is challenging. We propose a method based on parametric copulas which allows modeling joint distributions of neuronal and behavioral variables characterized by different statistics and timescales. To account for temporal or spatial changes in dependencies between variables, we model varying copula parameters by means of Gaussian Processes (GP). We validate the resulting Copula-GP framework on synthetic data and on neuronal and behavioral recordings obtained in awake mice. We show that the use of a parametric description of the high-dimensional dependence structure in our method provides better accuracy in mutual information estimation in higher dimensions compared to other non-parametric methods. Moreover, by quantifying the redundancy between neuronal and behavioral variables, our model exposed the location of the reward zone in an unsupervised manner (i.e., without using any explicit cues about the task structure). These results demonstrate that the Copula-GP framework is particularly useful for the analysis of complex multidimensional relationships between neuronal, sensory and behavioral variables., Understanding the relationship between a set of variables is a common problem in many fields, such as weather forecast or stock market data. In neuroscience, one of the main challenges is to characterize the dependencies between neuronal activity, sensory stimuli and behavioral outputs. A method of choice for modeling such statistical dependencies is based on copulas, which disentangle dependencies from single variable statistics. To account for changes in dependencies, we model changes in copula parameters by means of Gaussian Processes, conditioned on a task-related variable. The novelty of our approach includes 1) explicit modeling of the dependencies; and 2) combining different copulas to describe experimentally observed variability. We validate the goodness-of-fit as well as information estimates on synthetic data and on recordings from the visual cortex of mice performing a behavioral task. Our parametric model demonstrates significantly better performance in describing high dimensional dependencies compared to other commonly used techniques. We demonstrate that our model can estimate information and predict behaviorally-relevant parameters of the task without providing any explicit cues to the model. Our results indicate that our model is interpretable in the context of neuroscience applications, scalable to large datasets and suitable for accurate statistical modeling and information estimation.},

  abstract = {The use of energy flexibility to balance electricity demand and supply is becoming increasingly important due to the growing share of fluctuating energy sources. Electric flexibility regarding time or magnitude of consumption can be offered in the form of different products on electricity spot and balancing power markets. In the wake of the energy transition and because of new possibilities provided by digitalization, the decision intervals on these markets are becoming shorter and the controllability of electricity consumption and generation more small-scale. This evolution opens up new chances for formerly passive energy consumers. This thesis shows how electric flexibility can be monetized using the application example of commercial sites. These are often multimodal energy systems coupling electricity, heat, and gas, and thus deliver high flexibility potential. To leverage this potential, a comprehensive picture of demand-side flexibilization is provided and used to propose an energy management system and optimization for cost-optimized device schedules. The cost-optimization considers two simultaneous incentives: variable day-ahead spot market prices and revenues for offering possible schedule adjustments to the automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) balancing market. To solve the formulated optimization problem, a genetic algorithm is presented, tailored to the specific needs of consumers. In addition to addressing the trade-off between the two competing markets, the algorithm inherently considers the uncertain activation of aFRR bids and related catch-up effects. An analysis of the activation behavior of aFRR balancing market bids, based on a developed ex-post simulation, forms an important decision basis for the optimization. Finally, a simulation study concentrating on battery energy storage systems and combined heat and power plants on the consumer side enables the quantitative discussion of the optimization potential. The results show that consumers considering both markets simultaneously can achieve cost benefits that are up to multiples of those for pure day-ahead price optimization, despite the stochastic nature of aFRR balancing power activations. In conclusion, this thesis enables formerly passive electricity consumers to assume the role of alternative balancing service providers, hence contributing to the economic and reliable operation of power grids characterized by a high share of renewable energy sources.},

  abstract = {The increasing integration of intermittent renewable production requires more flexible as- sets in power systems. There are two potential paths in order to increase the remuneration of these flexible assets. The first one is to improve trading strategies in existing markets. The second one is to introduce new market mechanisms. This thesis studies both aspects by developing trading strategies for the Continuous Intraday Market, and by analyzing dif- ferent options for implementing a ``scarcity pricing mechanism'' in the European electricity market design. The contributions of the dissertation are organized in three chapters. Chapter 2 presents a method for trading the production of a storage unit in the Continuous In- traday Market. We model this problem in the Markov Decision Process framework. We present an approach based on Policy Function Approximation for tackling the problem. We provide relevant parameters for defining our policy, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it to a method commonly employed in the industry on real historical data. In chapter 3, we are interested in the problem of a renewable unit covering its position in the Continuous Intraday Market. As a starting point for tackling this problem, we characterize an optimal policy for trading a fixed quantity in a simplified version of the Continuous Intraday Market. We use this analytical solution as a basis for developing a Value Function Approximation algorithm and an alternative Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming algorithm that can trade under a more realistic set of assumptions. Chapter 4 proposes a methodology for analysing different market design options for imple- menting scarcity pricing in the European markets. The methodology relies on analytical insights that can be derived under an assumption of price-taking behavior. These insights are validated by a simulation model which represents the European balancing market as a Markov Decision Process. Our results highlight the benefit of introducing a market in the European market design for trading balancing capacity in real time.},

We use data from the Italian auction-based intraday market and the German continuous market and present descriptive statistics as well as multivariate regression models to analyze determinants of liquidity costs in both markets. To test for differences in liquidity due to market design, we employ a double machine learning technique controlling for several confounding variables. We show that weekly patterns, yearly seasonality, electricity demand, as well as the influence of temperatures significantly affect liquidity costs. Comparing liquidity costs in both market, we find that, overall, liquidity costs are lower on the Italian market. However, Italian costs increase towards later auctions, while the costs on the German continuous intraday market decrease and reach their low close to physical delivery, where costs are lower than on the last Italian market trading the corresponding products.},

  abstract = {With the rising extension of renewable energies, the intraday electricity markets have recorded a growing popularity amongst traders as well as electric utilities to cope with the induced volatility of the energy supply. Through their short trading horizon and continuous nature, the intraday markets offer the ability to adjust trading decisions from the day-ahead market or reduce trading risk in a short-term notice. Producers of renewable energies utilize the intraday market to lower their forecast risk, by modifying their provided capacities based on current forecasts. However, the market dynamics are complex due to the fact that the power grids have to remain stable and electricity is only partly storable. Consequently, robust and intelligent trading strategies are required that are capable to operate in the intraday market. In this work, we propose a novel autonomous trading approach based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms as a possible solution. For this purpose, we model the intraday trade as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm as our DRL approach. A simulation framework is introduced that enables the trading of the continuous intraday price in a resolution of one minute steps. We test our framework in a case study from the perspective of a wind park operator. We include next to general trade information both price and wind forecasts. On a test scenario of German intraday trading results from 2018, we are able to outperform multiple baselines with at least 45.24\% improvement, showing the advantage of the DRL algorithm. However, we also discuss limitations and enhancements of the DRL agent, in order to increase the performance in future works.},

We use an optimized parametric policy based on state-of-the-art intraday updates of renewable production forecasts and evaluate the resulting decisions out-of-sample for one year of trading based on detailed order book level data for the German market. Our strategies yield significant positive profits, which suggests that intraday power markets are not semi-strong efficient. Furthermore, sizable additional profits could be made using improved forecasts of renewable output, which implies that the quality of forecasts is an important factor for profitable trading strategies. This has the potential to trigger an arms race for more frequent and more accurate forecasts, which would likely lead to increased market efficiency, more reliable price signals, and more liquidity.},

Basically, short-term fluctuating electricity prices allow cost-optimized production planning by shifting electricity-intensive processes to times of favorable electricity prices. However, the day-ahead price as the outcome of an auction is not directly tradeable afterwards. We propose short-term flexible electricity certificates that pass on the day-ahead auction prices plus a premium for the supplier, enabling users to plan electricity consumption based on realized day-ahead auction prices. We analyze the supplier's problem of delivering electricity based on such certificates. The supplier can adjust the required electricity volume after the close of the day-ahead auction on the continuous intraday market. We analyze the price fluctuations in this market in relation to the day-ahead price and propose different trading strategies. Using the order book history of EPEX SPOT, we analyze the trading success and risk of these strategies. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent trading success can be explained by changes in market conditions, and, in particular, we identify renewable forecast errors as a driver.},

Recently, smart distributed energy resources have been equipped with functionality needed to participate on frequency reserves. Key categories of such resources include photovoltaic systems, batteries, and smart loads. Most of these resources are small and cannot provide the minimum controllable power required to participate on frequency reserves. Thus, virtual power plants have been used to aggregate the resources and trade them on the frequency reserves markets. The information technology aspects of virtual power plants are proprietary and many of the details have not been made public. The first contribution of this article is to propose a generic data model and application programming interface for a virtual power plant with the above-mentioned capabilities. The second contribution is to use the application programming interface to cope with the unpredictability of the frequency reserve capacity that the photovoltaic systems and other distributed energy resources are able to provide to the frequency reserves markets in the upcoming bidding period. The contributions are demonstrated with an operational virtual power plant installation at a Northern European shopping center, aggregating photovoltaic Primary Frequency Reserves resources.},

The higher the share of stochastic RES, the more often the price will be 0 {\texteuro}/MWh. The power market needs new methods to solve these problems. The development of virtual power plants (VPPs) is aimed at solving techno-economic problems with an increasing share of RES in the power market. This study analyses a possible implementation of stochastic and deterministic RES in a VPP to generate secured power, which can be implemented in the European Power Exchange (EPEX)/European Energy Exchange (EEX) power market using existing market products. In this study, the optimal economic VPP configuration for an RES-based power plant is investigated and implemented into standard power market products. The results show that the optimal economic VPP configuration for different market products varies, depending on the energy availability and the marginal costs of the VPP components. The size of the VPP components is positively correlated to the components' share of the energy generated. It was also found that projecting or implementing VPPs in Germany at current market prices (EPEX/EEX prices) is not yet economically feasible for a small share of market products. However, the secured power can be marketed on the SPOT and in the futures market with higher and more stable prices compared with the status quo.},

However, relevant information on the highly asset-specific flexibility potential is typically only known to plant operators themselves and not, e.g., to transmission system operators. Therefore, liberalized electricity markets use prices that set explicit monetary incentives to disclose the relevant private information about the market participants' assets. In this way, information asymmetries may be reduced. Given the different challenges of an integration of renewables, we argue that the associated new forms of volatile power profiles require new forms of power-trading products. In particular, based on recent advances in technical power measurement and billing, individual and market participant-specific power profiles may be superior to the current trading of average volumes. Against this background, we first outline various evolutionary adjustments of existing power-trading products and their underlying product parameters including (1) strengthening local pricing, (2) finer temporal granularity, (3) smaller minimum volume, and (4) shorter gate-closure time. Second, we open up a new perspective in form of a more disruptive shift towards power-profile trade, where market participants define their trading product using the actual power profile as a new product parameter.},

  abstract = {Germany aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2045.  Expanding renewable energy is a key pillar to achieve  this ambitious target, in which wind energy and PV will  play a dominant role. Given their intermittent charac- ter, the high penetration of wind and PV in the power  system imposes significant challenges for grid opera- tors and power markets to balance supply and demand.  At the same time, decarbonisation of all end use sectors  is associated with increasing electrification, which  would result in a substantial growth in gross electricity  demand and peak demand.  Thus, power system flexi- bility is key for achieving climate neutrality in Germany.  Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) have emerged as a promis- ing solution here. It is a collection of distributed energy  resources (DERs) that are centrally coordinated. DERs  consist of small- to medium- scale resources that are  connected mainly to the distribution grids or near the  end users, including distributed generation, demand- side resources, and energy storage. Despite their poten- tial of flexibility, they are often too small, scattered,  and/or their power generation is too fluctuating to di- rectly provide system service. A VPP, acting as an aggre- gator, will bundle these DERs into a sizable portfolio as  a single resource. It monitors, forecasts, optimizes, and  dispatches their generation, storage/release, or flexible  consumption through a central IT system to enable  them to participate in power markets and/or deliver the  flexibility to system operators.    The study 1) offers key insights about the development  of VPPs in Germany and its contribution to power sys- tem flexibility, through conducting case studies of VPP  business models and analysing the key power market  and regulatory framework, in which VPPs are embed- ded; 2) reflects on key enabling factors for VPPs in par- ticular, for its flexibility provision, in Germany.      What are the requirements for VPP busi- ness models?  {$\bullet$} Given the large pool of energy assets, VPP  needs an advanced ICT software platform, which  allows a large number of DERs to connect. The  platform should be able to capture data, enable  secure and fast communication between VPP,  individual assets, the grid operators, and elec- tricity market, and automatically regulate the  DERs to participate in electricity markets and  provide grid congestion service. It relies on ad- vanced forecasting algorithms to develop an op- timised dispatch schedule.  {$\bullet$} Hardware: Real-time data capture from, com- munication with, and controlling of DERs in  the portfolio requires smart meters, remote con- trol, and automation systems.   {$\bullet$} DERs in the portfolio: In order to increase rev- enue, it is important to build a diverse set of  DERs (generation, demand, and storage) and ex- plore business opportunities on different markets.  Biomass/ biogas power and hydropower plants  are considered as indispensable resources for  VPPs in Germany due to their high flexibility.  Small-scale DERs, such as BEVs, heat pumps,  home storage, rooftop PV, will play an increas- ingly important role in flexibility of the future  power system. Green hydrogen electrolysis  plants can also provide short- and long-term  flexibility similarly to biogas power plants.},

  abstract = {Extreme value modelling of peak load process is critical to the reliable specification of power generation, distribution and maintenance purposes during both peak and off-peak periods. In this study, a frequency assessment of extreme peak electricity demand for the four seasons of the year using South African data for the period, January 1997 to December 2013 is carried out. A point process approach from extreme value theory is proposed as an ingenious extreme value theory approach. The data are made stationary by using a time-varying threshold which has a positive shift factor. The non-linear detrended datasets are then grouped into summer, spring, winter and autumn according to the calendar dates in the Southern Hemisphere. The datasets were declustered to keep the series relatively independent using Ferro and Segers automatic declustering method. A stationary point process model is then fitted to each of the cluster maxima. The modelling framework, which is easily extensible to other peak load parameters, assumes that peak power follows a Poisson point process. The parameters of the developed model are estimated using the maximum likelihood method. Empirical results show that daily peak electricity demand could be experienced approximately 27, 16, 7 and 15 days per year in winter, spring, summer and autumn, respectively. The modelling approach could assist system operators of utility companies in scheduling maintenance of generating units including long term planning.},

However, applying GBDT to multi-task learning is still a challenge. Unlike deep models that can jointly learn a shared latent representation across multiple tasks, GBDT can hardly learn a shared tree structure. In this paper, we propose Multi-task Gradient Boosting Machine (MT-GBM), a GBDT-based method for multi-task learning. The MT-GBM can find the shared tree structures and split branches according to multi-task losses. First, it assigns multiple outputs to each leaf node. Next, it computes the gradient corresponding to each output (task). Then, we also propose an algorithm to combine the gradients of all tasks and update the tree. Finally, we apply MT-GBM to LightGBM. Experiments show that our MT-GBM improves the performance of the main task significantly, which means the proposed MT-GBM is efficient and effective.},

The stochastic nature of the demand for electricity, along with parameters such as temperature, humidity, and work habits, eventually causes deviations from expected demand. In this paper, we propose a feedback-based forecasting methodology in which the hourly prediction by a Fourier series expansion is updated by using the error at the current hour for the forecast at the next hour. The proposed methodology is applied to the Turkish power market for the period 2012--2017 and provides a powerful tool to forecasts the demand in hourly, daily and yearly horizons using only the past demand data. The hourly forecasting errors in the demand, in the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) norm, are 0.87\% in hour-ahead, 2.90\% in day-ahead, and 3.54\% in year-ahead horizons, respectively. An autoregressive (AR) model is also applied to the predictions by the Fourier series expansion to obtain slightly better results. As predictions are updated on an hourly basis using the already realized data for the current hour, the model can be considered as reliable and practical in circumstances needed to make bidding and dispatching decisions.},

We establish that an existing large language model, Flan-U-PaLM 540B, can be combined with an associative read-write memory to exactly simulate the execution of a universal Turing machine, U15 2. A key aspect of the finding is that it does , not require any modification of the language model weights. Instead, the construction relies solely on designing a form of stored instruction computer that can subsequently be programmed with a specific set of prompts.},

A pipeline framework using random forest feature selection and DBSCAN clustering attribute conversion is introduced to convert raw network data into attributes. A comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that our proposed framework sustains the data information effectively and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. An extra zero-shot learning experiment show that our attribute approach works well in zero-shot learning scenario.},

We formalize the problem of undersampling and explore the relationship between conditional probability in the presence and absence of undersampling. Although the bias due to undersampling does not affect the ranking order returned by the posterior probability, it significantly impacts the classification accuracy and probability calibration. We use Bayes Minimum Risk theory to find the correct classification threshold and show how to adjust it after undersampling.

Studies have shown that most models are not intrinsically well calibrated, meaning that their decision scores are not consistent with posterior probabilities. Hence being able to calibrate these models, or enforce calibration while learning them, has regained interest in recent literature. In this context, properly assessing calibration is paramount to quantify new contributions tackling calibration. However, there is room for improvement for commonly used metrics and evaluation of calibration could benefit from deeper analyses. Thus this paper focuses on the empirical evaluation of calibration metrics in the context of classification. More specifically it evaluates different estimators of the Expected Calibration Error (ECE), amongst which legacy estimators and some novel ones, proposed in this paper. We build an empirical procedure to quantify the quality of these ECE estimators, and use it to decide which estimator should be used in practice for different settings.},

  abstract = {Wind power interval prediction is an effective technique for quantifying forecasting uncertainty caused by the intermittent and fluctuant characteristics of wind energy. Valid coverage and short interval length are the two most critical targets in interval prediction to attain reliable and accurate information, providing effective support for decision-makers to better control the risks in the power planning. This paper proposes a novel interval prediction approach named conformalized temporal convolutional quantile regression networks (CTCQRN) which combines the conformalized quantile regression (CQR) algorithm with a temporal convolutional network (TCN), without making any distributional assumptions. The proposed model inherits the advantages of quantile regression and conformal prediction that is fully adaptive to heteroscedasticity implicated in data, and meets the theoretical guarantee of valid coverage. As opposed to conventional RNN-based approaches, the adopted TCN architecture frees from suffering iterative propagation and gradient vanishing/explosion, and can handle very long sequences in a parallel manner. Case studies on two different geographical wind power datasets show that the proposed model has a distinct edge over benchmark models in goals of valid coverage and narrow interval bandwidth, which can help to ensure the economic and secure operation of the electric power system.},

  abstract = {The increasing share of renewable energy in the electricity grid and progressing changes in power consumption have led to fluctuating, and weather-dependent power flows. To ensure grid stability, grid operators rely on power forecasts which are crucial for grid calculations and planning. In this paper, a Multi-Task Learning approach is combined with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict vertical power flows at transformers connecting high and extra-high voltage levels. The proposed method accounts for local differences in power flow characteristics by using an Embedding Multi-Task Learning approach. The use of a Bayesian embedding to capture the latent node characteristics allows to share the weights across all transformers in the subsequent node-invariant GNN while still allowing the individual behavioral patterns of the transformers to be distinguished. At the same time, dependencies between transformers are considered by the GNN architecture which can learn relationships between different transformers and thus take into account that power flows in an electricity network are not independent from each other. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through evaluation on two real-world data sets provided by two of four German Transmission System Operators, comprising large portions of the operated German transmission grid. The results show that the proposed Multi-Task Graph Neural Network is a suitable representation learner for electricity networks with a clear advantage provided by the preceding embedding layer. It is able to capture interconnections between correlated transformers and indeed improves the performance in power flow prediction compared to standard Neural Networks. A sign test shows that the proposed model reduces the test RMSE on both datasets compared to the benchmark models significantly.},

To perform this analysis, practitioners frequently resort to Pearson's (1895) product--moment correlation coefficient and the related significance tests. However, the use of such tests in isolation involves the risk of missing the nonlinear and particularly non-monotonic associations between the variables. This problem is also relevant in the cases where the dependence prevails between higher-order moments, e.g., variances, rather than means. We present a simple, computationally inexpensive heuristic by which this problem can be addressed and demonstrate its usefulness in a small number of example cases.},

  abstract = {We develop a simple Quantile Spacing (QS) method for accurate probabilistic estimation of one-dimensional entropy from equiprobable random samples, and compare it with the popular Bin-Counting (BC) and Kernel Density (KD) methods. In contrast to BC, which uses equal-width bins with varying probability mass, the QS method uses estimates of the quantiles that divide the support of the data generating probability density function (pdf) into equal-probability-mass intervals. And, whereas BC and KD each require optimal tuning of a hyper-parameter whose value varies with sample size and shape of the pdf, QS only requires specification of the number of quantiles to be used. Results indicate, for the class of distributions tested, that the optimal number of quantiles is a fixed fraction of the sample size (empirically determined to be {\textasciitilde}0.25--0.35), and that this value is relatively insensitive to distributional form or sample size. This provides a clear advantage over BC and KD since hyper-parameter tuning is not required. Further, unlike KD, there is no need to select an appropriate kernel-type, and so QS is applicable to pdfs of arbitrary shape, including those with discontinuous slope and/or magnitude. Bootstrapping is used to approximate the sampling variability distribution of the resulting entropy estimate, and is shown to accurately reflect the true uncertainty. For the four distributional forms studied (Gaussian, Log-Normal, Exponential and Bimodal Gaussian Mixture), expected estimation bias is less than 1\% and uncertainty is low even for samples of as few as 100 data points; in contrast, for KD the small sample bias can be as large as -10\% and for BC as large as -50\%. We speculate that estimating quantile locations, rather than bin-probabilities, results in more efficient use of the information in the data to approximate the underlying shape of an unknown data generating pdf.},

A majority of the existing methods of feature selection address the problem by devising some scoring function while treating the features independently, thereby overlooking their interdependencies. We leverage the scale invariance property of copula to construct a greedy, supervised feature selection algorithm that maximizes the feature relevance while minimizing the redundant information content. Multivariate copula is used in the proposed copula Based Feature Selection (CBFS) to discover the dependence structure between features. The incorporation of copula-based multivariate dependency in the formulation of mutual information helps avoid averaging over multiple instances of bivariate dependencies, thus eliminating the average estimation error introduced when bivariate dependency is used between a pair of feature variables. Under a controlled setting, our algorithm outperformed the existing best practice methods in warding off the noise in data. On several real and synthetic datasets, the proposed algorithm performed competitively in maximizing classification accuracy. CBFS also outperforms the other methods in terms of its noise tolerance property.},

  abstract = {Recently, many excellent algorithms for time series prediction issues have been proposed, most of which are developed based on the assumption that sufficient training data and testing data under the same distribution are available. However, in reality, time-series data usually exhibit some kind of time-varying characteristic, which may lead to a wide variability between old data and new data. Hence, how to transfer knowledge over a long time span, when addressing time series prediction issues, poses serious challenges. To solve this problem, in this paper, a hybrid algorithm based on transfer learning, Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine with Kernels (OS-ELMK), and ensemble learning, abbreviated as TrEnOS-ELMK, is proposed, along with its precise mathematic derivation. It aims to make the most of, rather than discard, the adequate long-ago data, and constructs an algorithm framework for transfer learning in time series forecasting, which is groundbreaking. Inspired by the preferable performance of models ensemble, ensemble learning scheme is also incorporated into our proposed algorithm, where the weights of the constituent models are adaptively updated according to their performances on fresh samples. Compared to many existing time series prediction methods, the newly proposed algorithm takes long-ago data into consideration and can effectively leverage the latent knowledge implied in these data for current prediction. In addition, TrEnOS-ELMK naturally inherits merits of both OS-ELMK and ensemble learning due to its incorporation of the two techniques. Experimental results on three synthetic and six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Many statistical methods and traditional machine learning techniques are commonly used for forecasting time series. With the development of deep learning in artificial intelligence, many researchers have adopted new models from artificial neural networks for forecasting time series. However, poor performance of applying deep learning models in short time series hinders the accuracy in time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to alleviate this problem based on transfer learning. Existing work on transfer learning uses extracted features from a source dataset for prediction task in a target dataset. In this paper, we propose a new training strategy for time-series transfer learning with two source datasets that outperform existing approaches. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on financial time series extracted from stock markets. Experiment results show that transfer learning based on 2 data sets is superior than other base-line methods.},

  abstract = {Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is an important problem in many fields. Accurate forecasting results can effectively help decision-making. Variables in MTS have rich relations among each other and the value of each variable in MTS depends both on its historical values and on other variables. These rich relations can be static and predictable or dynamic and latent. Existing methods do not incorporate these rich relational information into modeling or only model certain relation among MTS variables. To jointly model rich relations among variables and temporal dependencies within the time series, a novel end-to-end deep learning model, termed Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Heterogenous Graph Neural Networks (MTHetGNN) is proposed in this paper. To characterize rich relations among variables, a relation embedding module is introduced in our model, where each variable is regarded as a graph node and each type of edge represents a specific relationship among variables or one specific dynamic update strategy to model the latent dependency among variables. In addition, convolutional neural network (CNN) filters with different perception scales are used for time series feature extraction, which is used to generate the feature of each node. Finally, heterogenous graph neural networks are adopted to handle the complex structural information generated by temporal embedding module and relation embedding module. Three benchmark datasets from the real world are used to evaluate the proposed MTHetGNN and the comprehensive experiments show that MTHetGNN achieves state-of-the-art results in MTS forecasting task.},

It is dimension-free, and, unlike competing metrics, it performs well in small samples and no optimisations are needed. Indeed, TailCoR requires a few lines of coding and it is very fast. A Monte Carlo analysis confirms the goodness of the metric, which is illustrated on a sample of 21 daily financial market indexes across the globe and for 20 years.

  abstract = {Multivariate GARCH (MGARCH) models are usually estimated under multivariate normality. In this paper, for non-elliptically distributed financial returns, we propose copula-based multivariate GARCH (C-MGARCH) model with uncorrelated dependent errors, which are generated through a linear combination of dependent random variables. The dependence structure is controlled by a copula function. Our new C-MGARCH model nests a conventional MGARCH model as a special case. The aim of this paper is to model MGARCH for non-normal multivariate distributions using copulas. We model the conditional correlation (by MGARCH) and the remaining dependence (by a copula) separately and simultaneously. We apply this idea to three MGARCH models, namely, the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model of Engle [Engle, R.F., 2002. Dynamic conditional correlation: A simple class of multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models. Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 20, 339--350], the varying correlation (VC) model of Tse and Tsui [Tse, Y.K., Tsui, A.K., 2002. A multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model with time-varying correlations. Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 20, 351--362], and the BEKK model of Engle and Kroner [Engle, R.F., Kroner, K.F., 1995. Multivariate simultaneous generalized ARCH. Econometric Theory 11, 122--150]. Empirical analysis with three foreign exchange rates indicates that the C-MGARCH models outperform DCC, VC, and BEKK in terms of in-sample model selection and out-of-sample multivariate density forecast, and in terms of these criteria the choice of copula functions is more important than the choice of the volatility models.},

In order to address this problem, the mixtures of robust probabilistic principal component analyzers are introduced. They take care of atypical points by means of a long tail distribution, the Student-t. It is shown that the resulting mixture model is an extension of the mixture of Gaussians, suitable for both robust clustering and dimensionality reduction.

With this equivalence, the MI can be estimated by first estimating the empirical copula and then estimating the entropy of the empirical copula.

  abstract = {Recognition of a brain region's interaction is an important field in neuroscience. Most studies use the Pearson correlation to find the interaction between the regions. According to the experimental evidence, there is a nonlinear dependence between the activities of different brain regions that is ignored by Pearson correlation as a linear measure. Typically, the average activity of each region is used as input because it is a univariate measure. This dimensional reduction, i.e., averaging, leads to a loss of spatial information across voxels within the region. In this study, we propose using an information-theoretic measure, multivariate mutual information (mvMI), as a nonlinear dependence to find the interaction between regions. This measure, which has been recently proposed, simplifies the mutual information calculation complexity using the Gaussian copula. Using simulated data, we show that the using this measure overcomes the mentioned limitations. Additionally using the real resting-state fMRI data, we compare the level of significance and randomness of graphs constructed using different methods. Our results indicate that the proposed method estimates the functional connectivity more significantly and leads to a smaller number of random connections than the common measure, Pearson correlation. Moreover, we find that the similarity of the estimated functional networks of the individuals is higher when the proposed method is used.},

  abstract = {Renewable power generation forecasts using machine learning are typically implemented as single-task learning models, where a separate model is trained for each photovoltaic or wind park. In recent years, transfer learning is gaining popularity in these systems, as it can be used to transfer the knowledge gained from source parks to a target park. However, for transferring the knowledge to a target park, there is a need to determine the most similar source park(s) among the existing parks. This similarity determination using historical power measurements is challenging when the target park has limited to no historical data samples. Therefore, we propose a simple multi-task learning architecture that initially learns a common representation of input weather features among the tasks, using a Unified Autoencoder (UAE) and then learns the task specific information utilizing a Task Embedding layer in a Neural Network (TENN). This proposed architecture, UAE-TENN, can be easily extended to new parks with or without historical data. An elaborate performance comparison of single and multi-task learning models is performed on six photovoltaic and wind farm datasets comprising a total of 529 parks. UAE-TENN significantly improves the performance of power forecasting by 10 to 19\% for photovoltaic parks and 5 to 22\% for wind parks compared to the baseline models. Even in the zero-shot learning scenario, when there is no historical data, we successfully demonstrate that the UAE-TENN improves the forecast accuracy for a new park by 19\% for photovoltaic parks.},

In many cases, this approach improves the forecast error and reduces the required training data. However, it does not take the periodic influences in power forecasts within a day into account, i.e., the diurnal cycle. Therefore, we extended this idea to temporal convolutional networks to consider those in tasks of day-ahead power forecasts for renewables. We propose transforming the embedding space, which contains the latent similarities between tasks, through convolution and providing these results to the network's residual block. The proposed architecture significantly improves the forecast accuracy up~to \$\$25{\textbackslash}\%\$\$25\%for multi-task learning for power forecasts on the open EuropeWindFarm and GermanSolarFarm datasets compared to the MLP approach. Based on the same data, we achieve a ten percent improvement for the wind datasets and more than \$\$20{\textbackslash}\%\$\$20\%in most cases for the solar dataset for inductive transfer learning without catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we are the first to propose zero-shot learning for renewable power forecasts. The proposed architecture achieves an error as good as the task embedding MLP with a full year of training data in the respective experiments.},

  abstract = {There is recent interest in using model hubs -- a collection of pre-trained models -- in computer vision tasks. To employ a model hub, we first select a source model and then adapt the model for the target to compensate for differences. There still needs to be more research on model selection and adaption for renewable power forecasts. In particular, none of the related work examines different model selection and adaptation strategies for neural network architectures. Also, none of the current studies investigates the influence of available training samples and considers seasonality in the evaluation. We close these gaps by conducting the first thorough experiment for model selection and adaptation for transfer learning in renewable power forecast, adopting recent developments from the field of computer vision on 667 wind and photovoltaic parks from six datasets. We simulate different amounts of training samples for each season to calculate informative forecast errors. We examine the marginal likelihood and forecast error for model selection for those amounts. Furthermore, we study four adaption strategies. As an extension of the current state of the art, we utilize a Bayesian linear regression for forecasting the response based on features extracted from a neural network. This approach outperforms the baseline with only seven days of training data and shows that fine-tuning is not beneficial with less than three months of data. We further show how combining multiple models through ensembles can significantly improve the model selection and adaptation approach such that we have a similar mean error with only 30 days of training data which is otherwise only possible with an entire year of training data. We achieve a mean error of 9.8 and 14 percent for the most realistic dataset for PV and wind with only seven days of training data.},

Feature selection is one essential method in such applications for multiple objectives: improving the prediction accuracy by eliminating irrelevant features, accelerating the model training and prediction speed, reducing the monitoring and maintenance workload for feature data pipeline, and providing better model interpretation and diagnosis capability. However, selecting an optimal feature subset from a large feature space is considered as an NP-complete problem. The mRMR (Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance) feature selection framework solves this problem by selecting the relevant features while controlling for the redundancy within the selected features. This paper describes the approach to extend, evaluate, and implement the mRMR feature selection methods for classification problem in a marketing machine learning platform at Uber that automates creation and deployment of targeting and personalization models at scale. This study first extends the existing mRMR methods by introducing a non-linear feature redundancy measure and a model-based feature relevance measure. Then an extensive empirical evaluation is performed for eight different feature selection methods, using one synthetic dataset and three real-world marketing datasets at Uber to cover different use cases. Based on the empirical results, the selected mRMR method is implemented in production for the marketing machine learning platform. A description of the production implementation is provided and an online experiment deployed through the platform is discussed.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous tabular data are the most commonly used form of data and are essential for numerous critical and computationally demanding applications. On homogeneous data sets, deep neural networks have repeatedly shown excellent performance and have therefore been widely adopted. However, their adaptation to tabular data for inference or data generation tasks remains challenging. To facilitate further progress in the field, this work provides an overview of state-of-the-art deep learning methods for tabular data. We categorize these methods into three groups: data transformations, specialized architectures, and regularization models. For each of these groups, our work offers a comprehensive overview of the main approaches. Moreover, we discuss deep learning approaches for generating tabular data, and we also provide an overview over strategies for explaining deep models on tabular data. Thus, our first contribution is to address the main research streams and existing methodologies in the mentioned areas, while highlighting relevant challenges and open research questions. Our second contribution is to provide an empirical comparison of traditional machine learning methods with eleven deep learning approaches across five popular real-world tabular data sets of different sizes and with different learning objectives. Our results, which we have made publicly available as competitive benchmarks, indicate that algorithms based on gradient-boosted tree ensembles still mostly outperform deep learning models on supervised learning tasks, suggesting that the research progress on competitive deep learning models for tabular data is stagnating. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth overview of deep learning approaches for tabular data; as such, this work can serve as a valuable starting point to guide researchers and practitioners interested in deep learning with tabular data.},

In this paper, we hypothesize that the key to boosting the performance of neural networks lies in rethinking the joint and simultaneous application of a large set of modern regularization techniques. As a result, we propose regularizing plain Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks by searching for the optimal combination/cocktail of 13 regularization techniques for each dataset using a joint optimization over the decision on which regularizers to apply and their subsidiary hyperparameters. We empirically assess the impact of these regularization cocktails for MLPs in a large-scale empirical study comprising 40 tabular datasets and demonstrate that (i) well-regularized plain MLPs significantly outperform recent state-of-the-art specialized neural network architectures, and (ii) they even outperform strong traditional ML methods, such as XGBoost.},

  abstract = {Despite their impressive performance, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) typically underperform Gradient Boosting Trees (GBTs) on many tabular-dataset learning tasks. We propose that applying a different regularization coefficient to each weight might boost the performance of DNNs by allowing them to make more use of the more relevant inputs. However, this will lead to an intractable number of hyperparameters. Here, we introduce Regularization Learning Networks (RLNs), which overcome this challenge by introducing an efficient hyperparameter tuning scheme which minimizes a new Counterfactual Loss. Our results show that RLNs significantly improve DNNs on tabular datasets, and achieve comparable results to GBTs, with the best performance achieved with an ensemble that combines GBTs and RLNs. RLNs produce extremely sparse networks, eliminating up to 99.8\% of the network edges and 82\% of the input features, thus providing more interpretable models and reveal the importance that the network assigns to different inputs. RLNs could efficiently learn a single network in datasets that comprise both tabular and unstructured data, such as in the setting of medical imaging accompanied by electronic health records. An open source implementation of RLN can be found at https://github.com/irashavitt/regularizationlearningnetworks.},

  abstract = {Feature selection is used in many application areas relevant to expert and intelligent systems, such as data mining and machine learning, image processing, anomaly detection, bioinformatics and natural language processing. Feature selection based on information theory is a popular approach due its computational efficiency, scalability in terms of the dataset dimensionality, and independence from the classifier. Common drawbacks of this approach are the lack of information about the interaction between the features and the classifier, and the selection of redundant and irrelevant features. The latter is due to the limitations of the employed goal functions leading to overestimation of the feature significance. To address this problem, this article introduces two new nonlinear feature selection methods, namely Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (JMIM) and Normalised Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (NJMIM); both these methods use mutual information and the `maximum of the minimum' criterion, which alleviates the problem of overestimation of the feature significance as demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally. The proposed methods are compared using eleven publically available datasets with five competing methods. The results demonstrate that the JMIM method outperforms the other methods on most tested public datasets, reducing the relative average classification error by almost 6\% in comparison to the next best performing method. The statistical significance of the results is confirmed by the ANOVA test. Moreover, this method produces the best trade-off between accuracy and stability.},

Our work bridges the battery cell testing datasets to the  battery degradation modeling in grid applications and proposes  a new perspective to address the calendar life by the analysis of  the shallow cycles for the state of health (SOH) estimation,  which improves applicability and accuracy.

Nowadays, with accessible battery aging datasets and machine learning algorithms, there are opportunities for  data-driven battery health prognosis. However, most of the previous work is restricted in the scope of full-  discharge capacity records extrapolation, which has insufficient prospects in real-life applications. In this  work, we propose using partial discharge information for degradation estimation and prediction. Our Gaussian  process regression model achieves good performance by limited partial discharge information without re- quirements of feature selection. The accurate battery health prognosis in 300 cycles can be carried out by one  partial-discharge cycle at any degradation stage. The capacity estimation gives around 1 \% root mean square  error (RMSE) when using 30 \% information on the discharge process. As full-cycle discharge is not required, the  proposed model can diagnose the battery state of health (SOH) with a limited portion of battery operation in- formation extracted during the discharge process and reduce the effort of capacity tests. Further development of  this method brings opportunities for battery state evaluation and prediction in real applications with better  applicability and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) has a fast response time and high ramping capability, making it suitable for smart grid frequency regulation service. However, providing the required regulation capacity without a problem at any point in time is bound with the BESS state of charge (SOC) development periodically. Moreover, knowing SOC variation in advance will help the BESS producers keep SOC at the desired level. The BESS SOC can be maintained in the admissible operation area to avoid the mismatch penalties while following regulation signals. Therefore, the maximum service reward can also be achieved. Unfortunately, forecasting the SOC of BESS in frequency regulation service is not a straightforward problem. The forecasting method should deal with multiple dependent variables that periodically determine SOC's development. Moreover, developing a one-time manner multistep SOC forecasting model is also a challenge. To solve both problems, a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) regression learning architecture that has been proven to deal with sequentially interdependent data is adopted in our proposed forecasting framework. Various state-of-the-art memory cells in deep regression learning, i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), bi-directional (bi)-LSTM, and bi-GRU, were utilized and evaluated. The evaluation result shows that the developed models outperform the existing machine learning-based forecasting methods. The Bi-GRU cells provide the best performance in root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) evaluation metrics.},

As the main  energy storage device, lithium-ion batteries are one of the  key components that need to be properly managed. The  remaining useful life, which represents battery health, has  attracted increasing attention. Because accurate and  robust predictions provide important information for  predictive maintenance and cascade utilization. This paper  proposes a novel method to predict remaining useful life  based on the optimized health indicators and online model  correction with transfer learning. Gaussian process  regression is used to optimize the threshold for health  indicators to determine the end of life, and a usefulness  evaluation strategy is proposed to assess the health  indicators. Then, a combination of transfer learning and  gated recurrent neural network is designed to predict the  remaining useful life based on the optimized health  indicators directly, which can promote online applications.  The prediction model initially trained based on a relevant  battery is further fine-tuned according to the early  degradation cycling data of the test battery to provide  accurate predictions. Moreover, a self-correction strategy  is proposed to retrain the regression models so that the  models can gradually reach the optimal prediction  performance during the operating cycles, which could not  be achieved by traditional methods. The recommended  input sequence lengths for potential applications are  discussed. The method is verified by experiments of a  batch of batteries under fast charging conditions, and the  results show that, after fine-tuning, the proposed method  predicts remaining useful life with an error of fewer than 5  cycles.},

SOH estimation based on machine learning has attracted great  attention in recent years, and holds potentials for battery  informatization and cloud battery management techniques. In this  paper, a comprehensive study of the data-driven SOH estimation  methods is conducted. A new classification for health indicators  (HIs) is proposed where the HIs are divided into the measured  variables and calculated variables. To illustrate the significance of  data preprocessing, four noise reduction methods are assessed in  the HIs extraction process; different feature selection methods,  including filter-based method, wrapper-based method, and fusion- based method, are applied to select HIs subsets. The four widely  used machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural  network, support vector machine, relevance vector machine, and  Gaussian process regression, are applied and compared. In order  to evaluate the estimation performance in potential real usages  under future big data era, the three HIs selection methods and four  machine learning methods are evaluated using three public data  sets and two estimation strategies. The results show that the  combination of the fusion-based selection method and Gaussian  process regression has an overall superior estimation performance  in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.

For doing this, various deep learning models have been proposed, and recent models increase model size and complexity to achieve better accuracy which could also increase the burden on model design, computation time, and resources. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning model for accurate and efficient probabilistic STLF (PSTLF). First, we develop an STLF model utilizing the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-mixer structure, i.e., MLP-mixer for STLF (MM-STLF), that has an advantage in forecasting accuracy and efficiency compared to the other deep learning models. Then, we propose a random quantile regression (RQR) method that takes a cumulative probability {$\tau$} as an input to the model and is trained on random {$\tau$}s. By combining MM-STLF and RQR, we develop a novel deep-PSTLF model, namely quantile-mixer (Q-mixer). We evaluate the overall performance of the proposed model with seven load datasets in terms of prediction error, model size, and inference time, respectively. Through experiments, various STLF models and probabilistic forecasting methods are compared, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Q-mixer in load forecasting.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are considered as promising electric energy storage systems. However, identification of battery health is a critical issue. Furthermore, battery aging extremely depends on operating conditions. Therefore, monitoring and analysis of battery health degradation in real-time systems such as electric vehicles, in which a variety of stress factors may come into play, are demanded. This paper proposes a data-driven algorithm based on multiple condition indicator to estimate battery health using application-based load profiles. In this regard, battery cells have been cycled under a worldwide light duty driving test cycle (WLTC) load profile in laboratory to acquire real-world driving data. Time-domain and frequency-domain condition indicators are extracted from measured on-board data like voltage and current within certain time intervals, enabling real-time investigation of battery health degradation. The condition indicators have been fed into a Gaussian process estimator to track the real-time state of health (SoH). As degradation strongly depends on magnitude of input current, it is important that the proposed method can predict health of the cell regardless of current amplitude and aging pattern. Therefore, to assess accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, it is validated using a different load profile with distinct depth of discharge, current amplitude, and distinctive aging pattern. Results reveal the proposed approach is highly precise and is capable of estimating battery SoH with low computational costs and a relative error of less than 1\%. The proposed technique is promising for online diagnostics of battery health thanks to its high accuracy and robustness.},

The scientific community has not agreed on a general-purpose statistical indicator for evaluating two-class confusion matrices (having true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) yet, even if advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over accuracy and F1 score have already been shown.In this manuscript, we reaffirm that MCC is a robust metric that summarizes the classifier performance in a single value, if positive and negative cases are of equal importance. We compare MCC to other metrics which value positive and negative cases equally: balanced accuracy (BA), bookmaker informedness (BM), and markedness (MK). We explain the mathematical relationships between MCC and these indicators, then show some use cases and a bioinformatics scenario where these metrics disagree and where MCC generates a more informative response.Additionally, we describe three exceptions where BM can be more appropriate: analyzing classifications where dataset prevalence is unrepresentative, comparing classifiers on different datasets, and assessing the random guessing level of a classifier. Except in these cases, we believe that MCC is the most informative among the single metrics discussed, and suggest it as standard measure for scientists of all fields. A Matthews correlation coefficient close to +1, in fact, means having high values for all the other confusion matrix metrics. The same cannot be said for balanced accuracy, markedness, bookmaker informedness, accuracy and F1 score.},

Data-driven pre- diction methods have shown promise for accurately predicting cell behaviors with low computational cost, but they are expensive to train. Furthermore, given that the risk of battery failure is already very low, gathering enough relevant data to facilitate data-driven predictions is extremely challenging. Here, a perspective for designing experiments to facilitate a relatively low number of tests, handling the data, applying data-driven methods, and improving our understanding of behavior-dictating physics is outlined. This perspective starts with effective strategies for experimentally repli- cating rare failure scenarios and thus reducing the number of exper- iments, and proceeds to describe means to acquire high-quality datasets, apply data-driven prediction techniques, and to extract physical insights into the events that lead to failure by incorporating physics into data-driven approaches.},

Identifying models with high accuracy and low uncertainty is crucial for ensuring that model extrapolations are believable, however, it is difficult to compose expressions that accurately predict multivariate data trends; a review of cycling degradation models from literature reveals a wide variety of functional relationships. Here, a machine-learning assisted model identification method is utilized to fit degradation in a stand-out LFP-Gr aging data set, with uncertainty quantified by bootstrap resampling. The model identified in this work results in approximately half the mean absolute error of a human expert model. Models are validated by converting to a state-equation form and comparing predictions against cells aging under varying loads. Parameter uncertainty is carried forward into an energy storage system simulation to estimate the impact of aging model uncertainty on system lifetime. The new model identification method used here reduces life-prediction uncertainty by more than a factor of three (86\% {\textpm} 5\% relative capacity at 10 years for human-expert model, 88.5\% {\textpm} 1.5\% for machine-learning assisted model), empowering more confident estimates of energy storage system lifetime.},

\textbf{Algorithm}: To forecast remaining life for some test device, you pick the historical time series that looks most like the test device's (which includes multiple covariates, not just SOC or whatever); your forecast is failure time of the historical device with the best time series match.
\par
(Baru and Johnson, 2023, p. 2)
\par
\subsection{\textbf{III. Threshold Data}}

\par
\textbf{Data}: You have~\emph{no end-of-life data}, but you do know that, when certain~\emph{measurements}~are above~\emph{known thresholds}, the device will certainly fail.\\
\textbf{Algorithm}~So again, you do a sort of~\textbf{\href{app://obsidian.md/index.html\#Battery/SOH/Extrapolation}{\#Battery/SOH/Extrapolation}}, for the future of the current measurement values. My impression is that this~\emph{extrapolation method}~is physics based or follows a chosen statistical distributions e.g. (Hou et al., 2022)
\par
You can simplify by compressing the set of measurement values to a low dimension:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item e.g. PCA, probably to the 1st princ comp.
\item PCA can also transforms the thresholds linearly, so you then have a scalar (or low dim) threshold to check against
\item 
\par
A physics based method, like in (Shah et al., 2016)

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of the lithium-ion battery remaining useful life can effectively manage the lithium-ion battery health. Using the early cycle data to predict the remaining useful life can reduce consumption and detect battery failures earlier, but it is still a great challenge due to weak and high dimensional nonlinear feature data of the early cycle. In order to solve this issue, this paper proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that combines the idea of Broad Learning System (BLS), called BLS-LSTM, to accurately forecast the lithium-ion battery remaining useful life by using early cycle data. Firstly, according to the BLS idea, more effective feature nodes are obtained by performing mapping operations and enhancement operations on input features. Secondly, the characteristic nodes are input into the LSTM as new input nodes to predict the remaining useful life of the lithium-ion battery. Finally, the proposed model is validated with different early cycle data and compared with other methods. The results show that the BLS-LSTM model has better prediction performance and higher accuracy in the early prediction of the remaining useful life.},

  abstract = {Lithiumion (Li-ion) batteries have become increasingly useful within the automotive industry and modern life applications due to high energy and power densities. However, these batteries suffer capacity loss due to different ageing mechanisms in various applications. Despite several existing models, lack of accurate predictability of capacity degradation limits the advancement of Li-ion batteries. The present work focuses on prediction of battery useful capacity degradation using long-short term memory (LSTM) transfer learning neural network model. At first, a base model was developed and trained using all the (100\%) degradation data available at 0{$^\circ$}C and 10{$^\circ$}C environmental temperatures. Thereafter, the training of the base model was fixed, and additional hidden layers were added on top of the base model to further fine tune it with only the initial 30\% degradation data available at 25{$^\circ$}C environmental temperature. The remaining (70\%) data of the 25{$^\circ$}C case was tested for model prediction. To decide the number of fixed hidden layers to be transferred from base model to transfer model and the number of additional hidden layers on top, an optimization for minimum cross validation error was performed. It was found that the resulting model was able to forecast the remaining battery degradation with 96\% accuracy. The model prediction was also compared with LSTM deep learning architecture without using transfer learning. The LSTM with transfer learning model was found to be 17\% higher in prediction accuracy than that without utilizing transfer learning.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicles are increasingly becoming the vehicle of choice in today's environmentally conscious society, and the heart of an electric vehicle is its battery. Today, lithium-ion batteries are mainly used to power electric vehicles for its increased energy storage density and longevity. However, in order to estimate battery life, long and costly battery testing is required. Therefore, there is a need to investigate efficient ways that could reduce the amount of testing required by reusing existing knowledge of aging patterns from different kinds of battery chemistry. This work aims to answer two research questions. The first addresses the challenge of battery cell testing data that contain battery cells that do not reach the End-of-Life (EOL) threshold by the time the testing has been completed. For this challenge, we propose to implement survival analysis that is able to handle incomplete data or what is referred to as censored data. The second addresses how to reuse a model trained on one type of battery cell chemistry to predict the EOL of another battery cell chemistry by implementing transfer learning. We develop a workflow to implement a prediction model for one type of battery cell chemistry and to reuse this pre-trained model to predict the EOL for another type of battery cell chemistry.},

The literature in this complex topic has grown considerably; this perspective aims to distil current knowledge into a succinct form, as a reference and a guide to understanding battery degradation. Unlike other reviews, this work emphasises the coupling between the different mechanisms and the different physical and chemical approaches used to trigger, identify and monitor various mechanisms, as well as the various computational models that attempt to simulate these interactions. Degradation is separated into three levels: the actual mechanisms themselves, the observable consequences at cell level called modes and the operational effects such as capacity or power fade. Five principal and thirteen secondary mechanisms were found that are generally considered to be the cause of degradation during normal operation, which all give rise to five observable modes. A flowchart illustrates the different feedback loops that couple the various forms of degradation, whilst a table is presented to highlight the experimental conditions that are most likely to trigger specific degradation mechanisms. Together, they provide a powerful guide to designing experiments or models for investigating battery degradation.},

Battery health monitoring and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction are needed to prevent catastrophic failure of the battery. The aim of this research is to develop a data-driven method to monitor the batteries state of health and predict their RUL by using the battery capacity degradation data. This paper also investigated the effect of prediction starting point to the RUL prediction error. One of the data-driven method drawbacks is the need of a large amount of data to obtain accurate prediction. This paper proposed a method to generate a series of degradation data that follow the Gaussian distribution based on limited battery capacity degradation data. The prognostic model was constructed from the new data using least square support vector machine (LSSVM) regression. The remaining useful life prediction was carried out by extrapolating the model until reach the end of life threshold. The method was applied to three differences lithium-ion batteries capacity data. The results showed that the proposed method has good performance. The method can predict the lithium-ion batteries RUL with a small error, and the optimal RUL starting point was found at the point where the battery has experienced the highest capacity recovery due to the self-recharge phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Consumer wearable activity trackers, such as Fitbit are widely used in ubiquitous and longitudinal sleep monitoring in free-living environments. However, these devices are known to be inaccurate for measuring sleep stages. In this study, we develop and validate a novel approach that leverages the processed data readily available from consumer activity trackers (i.e., steps, heart rate, and sleep metrics) to predict sleep stages. The proposed approach adopts a selective correction strategy and consists of two levels of classifiers. The level-I classifier judges whether a Fitbit labeled sleep epoch is misclassified, and the level-II classifier re-classifies misclassified epochs into one of the four sleep stages (i.e., light sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep, and wakefulness). Best epoch-wise performance was achieved when support vector machine and gradient boosting decision tree (XGBoost) with up sampling were used, respectively at the level-I and level-II classification. The model achieved an overall per-epoch accuracy of 0.731 {\textpm} 0.119, Cohen's Kappa of 0.433 {\textpm} 0.212, and multi-class Matthew's correlation coefficient (MMCC) of 0.451 {\textpm} 0.214. Regarding the total duration of individual sleep stage, the mean normalized absolute bias (MAB) of this model was 0.469, which is a 23.9\% reduction against the proprietary Fitbit algorithm. The model that combines support vector machine and XGBoost with down sampling achieved sub-optimal per-epoch accuracy of 0.704 {\textpm} 0.097, Cohen's Kappa of 0.427 {\textpm} 0.178, and MMCC of 0.439 {\textpm} 0.180. The sub-optimal model obtained a MAB of 0.179, a significantly reduction of 71.0\% compared to the proprietary Fitbit algorithm. We highlight the challenges in machine learning based sleep stage prediction with consumer wearables, and suggest directions for future research.},

In the current work, series bench-scale tests are conducted using a cone calorimeter to explore the fire behavior of lithium-ion battery. The influence of two key factors, namely state of charge (SOC) and incident external heat flux, on the battery fire characteristics is especially investigated. Combustion behavior, time to ignition (TTI), heat release rate (HRR) and fire risk assessment are obtained. The battery with higher SOC under high incident heat flux presents a fierce combustion process and higher surface temperature than the others. It is noteworthy that the time to ignition and time to peak HRR (TTP) decrease with the SOC, whereas the peak HRR (pHRR) and total heat release (THR) increase overall. On the whole, the increment of incident heat flux causes the decrease in TTI and TTP, while the pHRR and THR increase at higher incident heat flux. And the values of TTI agree well with the classical ignition model. Finally, the fire risk of battery with different SOCs under various incident heat fluxes is also highlighted.},

  abstract = {To recycle retired series/parallel battery packs, it is necessary to know their state-of-health (SOH) correctly. Unfortunately, voltage imbalances between the cells occur repeatedly during discharging/charging. The voltage ranges for the discharge/charge of a retired series/parallel battery pack are reduced owing to the voltage imbalances between the cells. To determine the accurate SOH of a retired series/parallel battery pack, it is necessary to calculate the total discharge capacity using fully discharging/charging tests. However, a fully discharging/charging test is impossible owing to the reduced voltage range. The SOH of a retired series/parallel battery pack with a voltage imbalance should be estimated within the reduced discharging/charging voltage range. This paper presents a regression analysis of the peak point in the incremental capacity (IC) curve from the fresh state to a 100-cycle aging state. Moreover, the SOH of the considered retired series/parallel battery pack was estimated using a regression analysis model. The error in the SOHs of the retired series/parallel battery pack and linear regression analysis model was within 1\%, and hence a good accuracy is achieved.},

Failures of batteries can bring huge losses in terms of personnel, facility, environment, and reputation aspects. Therefore the accurate health estimation and high availability of batteries is urgently required by corresponding users, distributors, and manufactures. Fortunately, prognostics and health management (PHM) technique has been demonstrated the capability of supporting the improvement of the availability and reliability of batteries. In this paper, we gave a review on the state-of-the-art of the PHM study on batteries. We observed the increase of publication related to battery PHM in the past decade (2009-2018), especially in the past five years. Approaches related to battery performance prognostics are categorized into physics-based, data-driven and hybrid classes. Selection of the battery PHM approach requires to take the user requirement, data availability and degradation mechanisms attainability into consideration. Based on the survey, we also proposed research and development perspectives to conduct further studies on the battery PHM ,including the approach selection, health management, performance evaluation, uncertainty treatment, application economics, as well as environmental issues. We focused on PHM of lithium-ion batteries, given the fact that several publications discussed other types of batteries (e.g., lead-acid batteries).},

At the cell level, the time-sequence map helps clarify the relationship between thermal runaway and fire. At the system level, the time-sequence map depicts the relationship between the expected thermal runaway propagation and the undesired fire pathway. Mitigation strategies are fulfilled by cutting off a spe- cific transformation flow between the states in the time sequence map.

As rechargeable batteries, lithium-ion batteries serve as power sources in various application systems. Temperature, as a critical factor, significantly impacts on the performance of lithium-ion batteries and also limits the application of lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, different temperature conditions result in different adverse effects. Accurate measurement of temperature inside lithium-ion batteries and understanding the temperature effects are important for the proper battery management. In this review, we discuss the effects of temperature to lithium-ion batteries at both low and high temperature ranges. The current approaches in monitoring the internal temperature of lithium-ion batteries via both contact and contactless processes are also discussed in the review.},

  abstract = {The Lithium-ion battery (LIB) is an important technology for the present and future of energy storage, transport, and consumer electronics. However, many LIB types display a tendency to ignite or release gases. Although statistically rare, LIB fires pose hazards which are significantly different to other fire hazards in terms of initiation route, rate of spread, duration, toxicity, and suppression. For the first time, this paper collects and analyses the safety challenges faced by LIB industries across sectors, and compares them to the research contributions found in all the review papers in the field. The comparison identifies knowledge gaps and opportunities going forward. Industry and research efforts agree on the importance of understanding thermal runaway at the component and cell scales, and on the importance of developing prevention technologies. But much less research attention has been given to safety at the module and pack scales, or to other fire protection layers, such as compartmentation, detection or suppression. In order to close the gaps found and accelerate the arrival of new LIB safety solutions, we recommend closer collaborations between the battery and fire safety communities, which, supported by the major industries, could drive improvements, integration and harmonization of LIB safety across sectors.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are widely employed in industries and daily life. Research on the state of health (SOH) of batteries is essential for grasping the performance of batteries, better guiding battery health management, and avoiding safety mishaps caused by battery aging. Nowadays, most research adopts a data-driven artificial intelligence approach to assess SOH. However, the majority of approaches are based on entire voltage, current, or temperature curves. In reality, voltage, current, and temperature are frequently presented in segments, leading to the limited flexibility and slow analysis speed of the traditional techniques. This study solves the problem by dividing the whole voltage curve into many typical kinds of segments with equal timescales based on different typical voltage beginning points. On this foundation, the temporal convolution network (TCN) is used to create a sub-model of SOH estimation for several typical kinds of segments. In addition, the sub-models are fused using the bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) approach to boost accuracy. Finally, this research uses a publicly available dataset from Oxford to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested strategy.},

  abstract = {A diagnostic technique capable of quantitatively estimating degradation modes in-operando, including loss of lithium inventory and loss of active material, which operates under charge and discharge loads with realistic thermal boundary conditions is presented for the first time. The technique uses a zero-dimensional heat generation model with only three parameters requiring estimation, a simple heat transfer model, and requires just three temperature measurements per cell, voltage and current. The technique has been demonstrated to work for pouch cells with tab cooling and a constant coolant temperature and for charge and discharge rates of C/2, 1C and 2C. Compared to state-of-the-art open circuit voltage (OCV) model methods, the technique predicts electrode capacities and offset of a fresh cell with accuracies of 3\% and 6\% respectively. Further the technique has been shown to predict loss of lithium and loss of active material in the positive and negative electrodes with accuracies of 0.18\%, 0.22\% and 1.99\% respectively. The technique can therefore provide information of the same quality as the current state-of-the-art techniques but works under application relevant conditions and due to its simplicity is suitable for implementation on-line in a battery management system (BMS).},

Meanwhile, flexible and practical techniques are promising and innovative for achieving accurate and cost-effective state estimation. Herein, a novel curvature-based method is proposed to track battery degradation conditions. The proposed technique can ingeniously capture the health features of an aged battery from incremental capacity curves. Specifically, an advanced filter is employed to smooth the incremental capacity curves. Secondly, a self-definition sine function is applied to fit the smoothed incremental capacity curves. The curvature-based technique provides an essential manner for extracting the health features including the peak value and position from the fitted incremental capacity curves. On this basis, a flexible cost-effective numerical aging model is constructed by mapping the relationship between the feature indicators and battery capacity for battery health prognostic. Finally, for verification of the generalization and accuracy, the developed model is to estimate battery health conditions with the same type of battery under different experimental conditions. Experimental results of two types of batteries manifest that the proposed algorithm can provide accurate and credible battery health conditions with maximum relative errors of less than 4\%.},

In this paper, the battery SoH is detected based on the dynamic characteristic of the charging current during the constant-voltage (CV) period. Firstly, according to the preliminary analysis of the battery test data, the time constant of CV charging current is proved to be a robust characteristic parameter related to the battery aging. Secondly, the detailed expression of the current time constant is derived based on the first order equivalent circuit model (ECM). Thirdly, the quantitative correlation between the normalized battery capacity and the current time constant is established to indicate the battery SoH. Specifically, for the uncompleted CV charging process, the logarithmic function-based current time constant prediction model and the reference correlation curve are established to identify the battery capacity fading. At last, experimental results showed that regardless of the adopted data size, the correlation identified from one battery can be used to indicate the SoH of other three batteries within 2.5\% error bound except a few outliers.},

We propose a novel method for accurate SOH estimation which does not necessarily need full charging data. Using only partial charging data during normal usage, 10 derived voltage values (\$\$\{v\}\_\{sei\}\$\$) are collected. The initial \$\$\{v\}\_\{sei\}\$\$ point is fixed and then for every 1.5\% increase in the Coulomb counting, other points are selected. The difference between the \$\$\{v\}\_\{sei\}\$\$ values (\$\${\textbackslash}Delta \{v\}\_\{sei\}\$\$) and the average temperature during the charging form the feature vector at different SOH levels. The training data set is prepared by extrapolating the charging voltage curves for the complete SOH range using initial 400 cycles of data. The trained artificial neural network (ANN) based on the feature vector and SOH values can be used in any battery management system (BMS) with a time complexity of only \$\$O(\{n\}{\textasciicircum}\{4\})\$\$. Less than 1\% mean absolute error (MAE) for the test cases has been achieved. The proposed method has a moderate training data requirement and does not need any knowledge of previous SOH, state of charge (SOC) vs. OCV relationship, and absolute SOC value.},

  abstract = {Contemporary lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are one of the main components of energy storage systems that need effective management to extend service life and increase reliability and safety. Their characteristics depend highly on internal and external conditions (ageing, temperature, and chemistry). Currently, the state of batteries is determined using two parameters: the state of charge (SOC) and the state of health (SOH). Applying these two parameters makes it possible to calculate the expected battery life and a battery's performance. There are many methods for estimating the SOH of batteries, including experimental, model-based, and machine learning methods. By comparing model-based estimations with experimental techniques, it can be concluded that the use of experimental methods is not applicable for commercial cases. The electrochemical model-based SOH estimation method clearly explains processes in the battery with the help of multidifferential equations. The machine learning method is based on creating a program trained to predict the battery's state of health with the help of past ageing data. In this review paper, we analyze the research available in the literature in this direction. It is found that all methods used to assess the SOH of an LIB play an essential role, and each method has its pros and cons.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are chosen as the most suitable device for energy storage system (ESS) due to their high energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have high chemical reactivity, which increase the fire risk of products using them. Accordingly, various studies have been conducted to prevent lithium-ion battery-fire accidents but the main purpose of the conventional studies was to prevent the spread of fire after it started rather than predicting the risk of fire. Thus, there is a limit to reducing the maintenance time and cost of ESS. In this paper, a new method for real-time monitoring of the fire risk during operation of the battery pack is proposed. It combines with the electrochemical theory while using the real-time data from the electrically measured factors to select the aged cells. Also, a method of assessing the fire risk of battery packs by applying the interquartile range (IQR) filter to real-time data obtained from the electrically measured factors of battery packs is proposed. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified by the experiment using the specifications of the high-capacity battery packs used for railway vehicles.},

Despite numerous data-driven algorithms being developed to estimate battery SOH, they are often ineffective in handling time series data, as they are unable to utilize the most significant portion of a time series while predicting SOH. Furthermore, current data-driven algorithms are often unable to learn a health index, which is a measurement of the battery's health condition, to capture capacity degradation and regeneration. To address these issues, we first present an optimization model to obtain a health index of a battery, which accurately captures the battery's degradation trajectory and improves SOH prediction accuracy. Additionally, we introduce an attention-based deep learning algorithm, where an attention matrix, referring to the significance level of a time series, is developed to enable the predictive model to use the most significant portion of a time series for SOH prediction. Our numerical results demonstrate that the presented algorithm provides an effective health index and can precisely predict the SOH of a battery.},

This paper proposes a multi-dimensional health indicator (HI) battery state of health (SOH) prediction method involving the analysis of the battery equivalent circuit model and constant current discharge characteristic curve. The values of polarization resistance, polarization capacitance, and initial discharge resistance are identified as the health indicators reflective of the battery's state of health. Moreover, the retention strategy genetic algorithm (e-GA) selects the optimal voltage drop segment, and the corresponding equal voltage drop discharge time is also used as a health indicator. Based on the above health indicator selection strategy, a battery SOH prediction model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and LSTM neural network is constructed, and its accuracy is validated. The experimental results demonstrate that the suggested strategy is accurate and generalizable. Compared with the prediction model with single health indicator input, the accuracy is increased by 0.79\%.},

  abstract = {State-of-Health (SOH) prediction of lithium-ion batteries is crucial in battery management systems. In order to guarantee the safe operation of lithium-ion batteries, a hybrid model based on convolutional neural network (CNN)-bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and attention mechanism (AM) is developed to predict the SOH of lithium-ion batteries. By analyzing the charging and discharging process of batteries, the indirect health indicator (HI), which is highly correlated with capacity, is extracted in this paper. HI is taken as the input of CNN, and the convolution and pooling operations of CNN layers are used to extract the features of battery time series data. On this basis, a BiLSTM depth model is built in this paper to collect the data coming from CNN forward and reverse dependencies and further emphasize the correlation between the serial data by AM to obtain an accurate SOH estimate. Experimental results based on NASA PCoE lithium-ion battery data demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model outperforms other single models, with the root mean square error (RMSE) of SOH prediction results all less than 0.01, and can accurately predict the SOH of lithium-ion batteries.},

It is very challenging to obtain accurate predictions against uncertain application conditions by using only a few known historical data. In this article, we extend the widely studied remaining useful life (RUL) prediction to the prediction of charge and discharge capacity trajectories under both fixed and random future operating conditions. This is achieved by developing a general deep learning framework cored by recurrent neural network (RNN) which integrates future current plan and few early capacity-voltage data as inputs. As a case study, we have experimented with 77 commercial batteries cycled under fixed and random operating conditions. We demonstrate that the median root mean square error (RMSE) of prediction can be within 2.4\% for NMC/graphite batteries and 2.3\% for LFP/graphite batteries by using 3.8\% of the whole life data only. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed framework predicts more accurately and has a very balanced performance for both fixed and random future conditions. This work highlights the promise of actively forecasting the future of batteries based on RNN.},

  abstract = {Future capacity prediction of lithium-ion batteries is a highly researched topic in the field of battery management systems, owing to the gradual degradation of battery capacity over time due to various factors such as chemical changes within the battery, usage patterns, and operating conditions. The accurate prediction of battery capacity can aid in optimizing its usage, extending its lifespan, and mitigating the risk of unforeseen failures. In this paper, we proposed a novel fine-tuning model based on a deep learning model with a transfer learning approach comprising of two key components: offline training and online prediction. Model weights and prediction parameters were transferred from offline training using source data to the online prediction stage. The transferred Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory with an Attention Mechanism model weights and prediction parameters were utilized to fine-tune the model by partial target data in the online prediction phase. Three battery batches with different charging policy were used to evaluate the proposed approach's robustness, reliability, usability, and accuracy for the three charging policy batteries' real-world data. The experiment results show that the proposed method's efficacy improved, with an increase in the cycle number of the starting point, exhibiting a linear relationship with the starting point. The proposed method yields relative error values of 8.70\%, 6.38\%, 9.52\%, 7.58\%, 1.94\%, and 2.29\%, respectively, for the six target batteries in online prediction. Thus, the proposed method is effective in predicting the future capacity of lithium-ion batteries and holds potential for use in predictive maintenance applications.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries is critical for accelerating technological advancements and applications. Nevertheless, the complex aging mechanisms and dynamic operating conditions of lithium-ion batteries have remained major challenges. This paper proposes a method for early predicting lithium-ion batteries cycle life based on weighted least squares support vector machine (WLS-SVM) with health indicators (HIs) as input. The HIs are extracted from lithium-ion batteries voltage-capacity discharge curves, since these curves are easy to measure and strongly correlate to battery cycle life. Taking into account the nonlinearity of batteries cycle life, a support vector machine (SVM) that is capable of strong generalization is used to predict cycle life. As a solution to the problem of misleading results from outlier data in SVM, error square term combined with weight functions is used in this study to improve robustness and prediction accuracy. The datasets of 41 cells are used to verify the proposed early prediction method. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of cycle life prediction results by the proposed method are much lower, and the cycle life early prediction errors of the test cells are all {$<$}9~\%, which notes that the proposed method is accurate and valid for cycle life early prediction.},

  abstract = {In addition to providing energy to end-consumers, power system operators are also responsible for ensuring system reliability. To this end, power markets maintain an array of ancillary services to ensure it is always possible to balance the supply and demand for energy in real-time. A subset of these ancillary services are commonly procured through market-based mechanisms: namely, Regulation, Spinning, and Non-spinning Reserves.  Regulation Reserves are maintained to respond to supply/demand imbalances over much shorter time frames, typically on the order of one to several seconds. Resources that provide Regulation Reserves adjust their generation or load levels in response to automatic generation control (AGC) signals provided by the system operator.  Operating reserves are maintained to provide additional generation capacity in the event that load increases or other supply side resources reduce their output or are taken offline. The reserves are typically segmented into two categories, 1) Spinning or Synchronized Reserves that are provided by generation units that are actively generating and have the ability to increase or decrease their output, 2) Non-spinning or Non-synchronized Reserves that are provided by generation resources that are not actively generating, but are able to start up and provide generation within a specified timeframe.  Operating reserves typically have response times on the order of ten to 30 minutes and can similarly be provided by supply-side resources that are capable of reducing their load.  There are seven distinct power markets in the United States, each operated by a Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) or Independent System Operator (ISO) that manages transmission infrastructure in its territory, operates markets for energy and ancillary services, and maintains system reliability. Each power market offers its own set of ancillary services, and precise definitions, requirements, and market mechanisms differ between markets.  Despite the differences between markets, both in terms of services offered and system requirements, some broad trends generally apply. Regulation Reserves typically have the highest market prices, followed by Spinning Reserves and Non-spinning Reserves. Prices for Regulation Reserves have been the highest in the PJM market, since it opened in October 2012. This is partially because PJM experienced large price spikes during the period of extreme weather conditions in early 2014. ERCOT has traditionally had the highest prices for Spinning Reserves (called Responsive Reserves in ERCOT), including several periods of sustained high prices between 2010 and 2012. This can be explained in part by the relatively high penetration of variable wind resources and a similarly high requirement relative to peak load.  ERCOT has also traditionally had the highest price for Non-spinning Reserves, followed by the NYISO East region. Both experienced several periods of prolonged high prices since their inception, an occurrence that has not been regularly seen in other markets.  Market size (in terms of capacity) typically follows the reverse order of prices, as systems maintain the most Non-spinning Reserves capacity followed by Spinning Reserves and Regulation Reserves. PJM has the largest market for Regulation Reserves both in terms of revenue and capacity. Total revenue in PJM has grown since the market opened in 2012 due to increased prices. The size of most Regulation Survey of U.S. Ancillary Services Markets Reserves markets in terms of capacity stay relatively constant year-to-year, as this is dictated largely by system requirements. PJM also has the largest Spinning Reserves market in terms of capacity, but due to low prices in 2012 and 2013, total market revenue was relatively small prior to 2014. SPP, MISO, ISO-NE and SPP (beginning in 2014) all have Spinning Reserve markets with similar average capacity levels.  When combined, the markets for Non-spinning and Operating reserves in ISO-NE have a comparable capacity to the market for Primary Reserves in PJM. SPP, MISO, and CAISO all have smaller markets for their respective Non-spinning Reserves products that are roughly the same size as each other in terms of capacity.},

We will refer to this new model as X-Model, as almost every deregulated electricity price is simply the result of the intersection of the electricity supply and demand curve at a certain auction. Therefore we show an approach to deal with a tremendous amount of auction data, using a subtle data processing technique as well as dimension reduction and lasso based estimation methods. We incorporate not only several known features, such as seasonal behavior or the impact of other processes like renewable energy, but also completely new elaborated stylized  facts of the bidding structure. Our model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of the electricity price, which is especially useful for predicting huge price spikes. Using simulation methods we show how to derive prediction intervals for probabilistic forecasting.

  abstract = {In many countries, electricity prices on day-ahead auction markets result from a market clearing designed to maximize social welfare. For each hour of the day, the market price can be represented as the intersection of a supply and demand curve. Structural market models reflect this price formation mechanism and are widely used in prospective studies guiding long-term decisions (e.g. investments and market design). However, simulating the supply curve in these models proves challenging since estimating the sell orders it comprises (i.e. offer prices and corresponding quantities) typically requires formulating numerous techno-economic hypotheses about power system assets and the behaviors of market participants. Due to imperfect competition, real market prices differ from the theoretical optimum, but modeling this difference is not straightforward. The objective of this work is to propose a model to simulate prices on day-ahead markets that account for the optimal economic dispatch of generation units, while also making use of historical day-ahead market prices. Inferring from historical data is especially important when not all information is made public (e.g. bidding strategies) or due to difficulty in accurately accounting for qualitative notions in quantitative models (e.g. market power). In this paper we propose a method for the parametrization of sell orders associated with production units. The estimation algorithm for this parametrization makes it possible to mitigate the requirement for analytic formulation of all of the above-mentioned aspects and to take advantage of the ever-increasing volume of available data on power systems (e.g. technical and market data). Parametrized orders also offer the possibility to account for various factors in a modular fashion, such as the strategic behavior of market participants. The proposed approach is validated using data related to the French day-ahead market and power system, for the period from 2015 to 2018.},

  abstract = {In deregulated electricity markets, accurate modeling and forecasting of different variables, e.g. demand, prices, production etc. have obtained increasing importance in recent years. As in most electricity markets, the daily demand and prices are determined the day before the physical delivery by means of (semi-) hourly concurrent auctions, accurate forecasts are necessary for the efficient management of power systems. However, it is well known that electricity (demand/price) data exhibit some specific features, among which, daily, weekly and annual periodic patterns as well as non-constant mean and variance, jumps and dependency on calendar effects. Modeling and forecasting, thus, is a challenging task. This thesis tackles these two issues, and to do this, two approaches are followed.    In the first case, we address the issue of modeling and out-of-sample forecasting electricity demand and price time series. For this purpose, an additive component model was considered that includes some deterministic and a stochastic residual components. The deterministic components include a long-term dynamics, annual and weekly periodicities and calendar effects. The first three components were estimated using splines while the calendar effects were modeled using dummy variables. The residual component is instead treated as stochastic and different univariate and multivariate models have been considered with increasing level of complexity. In both cases, linear parametric and nonlinear nonparametric models, as well as functional based models, have been estimated and compared in a one day-ahead out-of-sample forecast framework.    The class of univariate models includes parametric autoregressive models (AR), nonparametric and nonlinear regression models based on splines (NPAR) and scalar-response functional models, that in turns can be formulated parametrically (FAR) or non parametrically (NPFAR). The multivariate models are vector autoregressive models (VAR) and functionalresponse, parametric (FFAR) and nonparametric (NPFFAR), models. For this issue, five different electricity markets, namely, British electricity market (APX Power UK), Nord Pool electricity market (NP), Italian electricity market (IPEX), Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland electricity market (PJM) and Portuguese electricity market (OMIE(Po)) were considered for the period 2009 to 2014. The first five years were used for model estimation while the year 2014 was left for one-day-ahead forecasts. Predictive performances are first evaluated by means of descriptive indicators and then through a test to assess the significance of the differences. The analyses suggest that the multivariate approach leads to better results than the univariate one and that, within the multivariate framework, functional models are the most accurate, with VAR being a competitive model in some cases. The results also lead to another important finding concerning to the performance of parametric and nonparametric approach that showed strong linkage with underlying process. Finally the obtained results were compared with other works in the literature that suggest our forecasting errors are smaller compared with the state-of-art prediction techniques used in the literature.    In the second part of this thesis the issue of electricity price forecasting is revisited following a completely different approach. The main idea of this approach is that of modeling the daily supply and demand curves, predicting them and finding the intersection of the predicted curves in order to find the predicted market clearing price and volume. In this approach, the raw bids/offers data for demand and supply, corresponding to each (half-) hour is first aggregated in a specific order. The functional approach converts the resulted piece wise curves into smooth functions. For this issue, parametric functional model (FFAR) and the nonlinear nonparametric counterpart (NPFFAR) were considered. As benchmark, an ARIMA model was fitted to the scalar time series corresponding to the market clearing prices obtained from the crossing points of supply and demand curves. Data from Italian electricity market were used for this issue and the results are summarized by different descriptive indicators. As in the first case, results show superior forecasting performance of our functional approach compare to ARIMA. Among different models, the nonparametric functional model produces better results compared to parametric models. Apart from the improvement in forecasting accuracy, it is important to stress that this approach can be used for optimizing bidding strategies. As forecasting the whole curves gives deep insight into the market, our analysis showed that this strategy can significantly improve bidding strategies and maximize traders profit.},

The key feature of the X-model is that it makes a day-ahead forecast for the entire wholesale supply and demand curves. The intersection of the predicted curves yields the forecast for equilibrium day-ahead prices and volumes. We take advantage of a technique for auction curves' transformation to improve the original X-model. Instead of using actual wholesale supply and demand curves, we rely on transformed versions of these curves with perfectly inelastic demand. As a result, the computational requirements of our X-model are reduced and its forecasting power increases. Moreover, our X-model is more robust towards outliers present in the initial auction curves' data.

  abstract = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries play an important role in providing necessary energy when acting as a main or backup source of electricity. Indeed, the unavailability of battery aging discharge data in most real-world applications makes the State of Health (SoH) assessment very challenging. Alternatively, accelerated aging is therefore adopted to emulate the degradation process and to achieve an SoH estimate. However, accelerated aging generates limited deterioration patterns suffering from a higher level of complexity due to the non-linearity and non-stationarity imposed by harsh conditions. In this context, this paper aims to provide a predictive model capable of solving incomplete data problems by providing two main solutions for each of the problems of complexity and missing patterns, respectively. First, to overcome the problem of lack of patterns, a robust collaborative feature extractor (RCFE) is designed by collaborating between a set of improved restricted Boltzmann machines (I-RBMs) to be able to share learning knowledge among different locally trained I-RBMs to create a more generalized global extraction model. Second, a set of RCFEs is then evolved through a neural network with an augmented hidden layer (NAHL) to enhance the predictive ability by further exploring representation learning to overcome pattern complexity issues. The designed RCFE-NAHL is trained to predict SoH using constant current (CC) discharge characteristics by implying multiple characteristics recorded through the constant voltage (CV) charging process as indicators of health. The proposed SoH prediction approach performances are evaluated on a set of battery life cycles from the well-known NASA database. In this context, the achieved results clearly highlight the higher accuracy and robustness of the proposed learning model.},

Irrespective of the application, reliable real-time estimation of battery state of health (SOH) by on-board computers is crucial to the safe operation of the battery, ultimately safeguarding asset integrity. In this Article, we design and evaluate a machine learning pipeline for estimation of battery capacity fade---a metric of battery health---on 179 cells cycled under various conditions. The pipeline estimates battery SOH with an associated confidence interval by using two parametric and two non-parametric algorithms. Using segments of charge voltage and current curves, the pipeline engineers 30 features, performs automatic feature selection and calibrates the algorithms. When deployed on cells operated under the fast-charging protocol, the best model achieves a root-mean-squared error of 0.45\%. This work provides insights into the design of scalable data-driven models for battery SOH estimation, emphasizing the value of confidence bounds around the prediction.

  abstract = {Wind turbine (WT) condition monitoring has gained increasing interests in the era of the Internet of Energy (IoE), and existing monitoring approaches mainly focus on training a reliable model in a centralized manner. However, there are three main challenges: data islands due to data privacy and strict confidentiality of wind farm owners, domain shift due to distribution difference of different WTs, and computing and communication burden due to a large number of model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient federated transfer learning framework (EFTLWT) for collaborative monitoring of WTs in IoE-enabled wind farms, which integrates the adversarial domain adaptation into the federated framework to address the domain shift issue across multiple WTs from different wind farms. It is the first attempt to apply federated transfer learning into the field of WT monitoring. Specifically, we design a lightweight multi-scale neural network model to reduce the computation and communication cost between the client and the server. Furthermore, we propose a partial aggregation strategy to aggregate partial model parameters to reduce the model weight during the uploading and downloading, thus further reducing the burden of communication bandwidth and speeding up the response of the monitoring system. We carry out extensive experiments on real operating datasets of WTs and the results show that our EFTLWT can effectively reduce the domain shift and communication cost, decrease the response time, and greatly improve the performance of the local and federated model while maintaining the favorably comparable performance as the centralized model.},

Unfortunately, these models are prone to significant estimation errors without appropriate knowledge of their inherent limitations and the interdependence between stress factors. This article presents a review of empirical and semiempirical modeling techniques and aging studies, focusing on the trends observed between different studies and highlighting the limitations and challenges of the various models. First, we summarize the main aging mechanisms in lithium-ion batteries. Next, empirical modeling techniques are reviewed, followed by the current challenges and future trends, and a conclusion. Our results indicate that the effect of stress factors is easily oversimplified, and their correlations are often not taken into account.

  abstract = {Remaining useful life prediction is one of the key requirements in prognostics and health management. While a system or component exhibits degradation during its life cycle, there are various methods to predict its future performance and assess the time frame until it does no longer perform its desired functionality. The proposed data-driven and model-based hybrid/fusion prognostics framework interfaces a classical Bayesian model-based prognostics approach, namely particle filter, with two data-driven methods in purpose of improving the prediction accuracy. The first data-driven method establishes the measurement model (inferring the measurements from the internal system state) to account for situations where the internal system state is not accessible through direct measurements. The second data-driven method extrapolates the measurements beyond the range of actually available measurements to feed them back to the model-based method which further updates the particles and their weights during the long-term prediction phase. By leveraging the strengths of the data-driven and model-based methods, the proposed fusion prognostics framework can bridge the gap between data-driven prognostics and model-based prognostics when both abundant historical data and knowledge of the physical degradation process are available. The proposed framework was successfully applied on lithium-ion battery remaining useful life prediction and achieved a significantly better accuracy compared to the classical particle filter approach.},

Here, various machine-learning models, such as linear, Gaussian process, random forest, and artificial neural network regression, are utilized to predict capacity from EIS using hundreds of capacity, direct current (DC) resistance, and EIS measurements recorded under varying conditions of health, temperature, and state of charge (SOC). Several feature extraction and selection methods from traditional electrochemical analysis and statistical modeling are explored using machine-learning pipelines. EIS data from just two frequencies can accurately predict capacity, and interrogation shows that the optimal set of frequencies is not usually intuitive. Best results are achieved with an ensemble model, which predicts battery capacity with a mean absolute error of 1.9\% on data from unobserved cells.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries degrade over time, based on their usage and these changes can be observed in the terminal voltage and cell expansion curves with respect to SOC. Physics-based battery models augmented with degradation modes can describe the changes in battery electrical and mechanical response as the battery ages and can be tuned to predict the observed rate of change. Tuning these models is computationally intensive, because it requires multiple simulations of the battery aging process over the entire lifetime. Accelerated simulations that use an adaptive inter-cycle extrapolation algorithm [1] can reduce simulation time and thus enable use of optimization algorithms to automatically tune degradation models [2]. In this work, we investigate how the amount of aging data used to train the model impacts the prediction of future battery aging assuming the battery continues to operate under the same conditions. The electrode-specific state of health (eSOH) parameters are computed from the reference performance testing performed at periodic intervals throughout the battery's lifetime. These four parameters include the capacities of positive and negative electrodes Cp and Cn, and the corresponding electrode stoichiometric windows y0 and x100. These 4 parameters extracted from a cell aged at C/5 constant current charging rate were used for training the model. The aging model includes SEI growth in the negative electrodes which causes a loss of cyclable lithium/loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and loss of electrode active material (LAM) due to particle cracking at both the negative and positive electrodes. Simulation results show us that a shorter training window of three eSOH reference points (every 25 cycles) over (Cycles 41 to 98) over-predicts battery degradation because the rate of degradation during these initial cycles is larger than the degradation which happens later in the battery's life. The battery degradation parameters that are predicted (and shown in the figure) include battery capacity, maximum reversible swelling in the battery, loss of active material in the negative electrode and loss of lithium inventory. If we increase the model training window to five eSOH data points (Cycles 41 to 175), the prediction of battery degradation is much better because the model now accounts for both the initial higher rate of degradation and subsequent lower rate of degradation.},

  abstract = {Various modeling techniques are used to predict the capacity fade of Li-ion batteries. Algebraic reduced-order models, which are inherently interpretable and computationally fast, are ideal for use in battery controllers, technoeconomic models, and multi-objective optimizations. For Li-ion batteries with graphite anodes, solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) growth on the graphite surface dominates fade. This fade is often modeled using physically informed equations, such as square-root of time for predicting solvent-diffusion limited SEI growth, and Arrhenius and Tafel-like equations predicting the temperature and state-of-charge rate dependencies. In some cases, completely empirical relationships are proposed. However, statistical validation is rarely conducted to evaluate model optimality, and only a handful of possible models are usually investigated. This article demonstrates a novel procedure for automatically identifying reduced-order degradation models from millions of algorithmically generated equations via bi-level optimization and symbolic regression. Identified models are statistically validated using cross-validation, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification via bootstrapping. On a LiFePO4/Graphite cell calendar aging data set, automatically identified models utilizing square-root, power law, stretched exponential, and sigmoidal functions result in greater accuracy and lower uncertainty than models identified by human experts, and demonstrate that previously known physical relationships can be empirically ``rediscovered'' using machine learning.},

We then discuss six knee ``pathways'', including lithium plating, electrode saturation, resistance growth, electrolyte and additive depletion, percolation-limited connectivity, and mechanical deformation---some of which have internal state trajectories with signals that are electrochemically undetectable. We also identify key design and usage sensitivities for knees. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities for knee modeling and prediction.

  abstract = {Reduced-order physics-based life models are extremely useful for rapidly predicting battery state-of-health and for simulating battery lifetime in arbitrary aging conditions. However, identification of well-parameterized models is difficult. This is because, for maximum usefulness in predicting lifetime under a variety of conditions, aging test data exhibits many degradation mechanisms, which all need to be accurately modeled. However, because aging tests are time-consuming and expensive, especially for large-format batteries, a minimum of tests are conducted while probing many stress factors. Building a well-parameterized model is then very challenging: an under-parameterized model will neglect critical degradation modes, and an over-parameterized model will extrapolate poorly to new testing conditions. To complicate this matter, the functional form of the model for any individual degradation rate can be very difficult to identify. In this work, the statistical tools of penalized regression and bilevel optimization are used to help identify both the functional forms of and optimize the parameters of reduced-order life models, accelerating identification of robust models. Model robustness is demonstrated through traditional statistics methods of cross-validation and sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification through bootstrap resampling and Monte-Carlo simulation, and simulation of real-world use cases.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are the most popular energy storage technology in consumer electronics and electric vehicles and are increasingly applied in stationary storage systems. Yet, concerns about safety and reliability remain major obstacles, which must be addressed in order to improve the acceptance of this technology. The gradual degradation of Li-ion cells over time lies at the heart of this problem. Time, usage and environmental conditions lead to performance deterioration and cell failures, which, in rare cases, can be catastrophic due to fires or explosions. The physical and chemical mechanisms responsible for degradation are numerous, complex and interdependent. Our understanding of degradation and failure of Li-ion cells is still very limited and more limited yet are reliable and practical methods for the detection and prediction of these phenomena. This dataset contains the results of long term cycling of 8 lithium-ion cells in our lab in Oxford. The full details are given in the readme.txt file.},

  abstract = {Battery ensures power solutions for many necessary portable devices such as electric vehicles, mobiles, and laptops. Owing to the rapid growth of Li-ion battery users, unwanted incidents involving Li-ion batteries have also increased to some extent. In particular, the sudden breakdown of industrial and lightweight machinery due to battery failure causes a substantial economic loss for the industry. Consequently, battery state estimation, management system, and estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) have become a topic of interest for researchers. Considering this, appropriate battery data acquisition and proper information on available battery data sets may require. This review paper is mainly focused on three parts. The first one is battery data acquisitions with commercially and freely available Li-ion battery data set information. The second is the estimation of the states of battery with the battery management system. And third is battery RUL estimation. Various RUL prognostic methods applied for Li-ion batteries are classified, discussed, and reviewed based on their essential performance parameters. Information on commercially and publicly available data sets of many battery models under various conditions is also reviewed. Various battery states are reviewed considering advanced battery management systems. To that end, a comparative study of Li-ion battery RUL prediction is provided together with the investigation of various RUL prediction algorithms and mathematical modelling.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of global electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and aerospace, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become more and more widely used due to their high property. More and more disasters are caused by battery combustion. Among them, the temperature prediction of LIBs is the key to prevent the occurrence of fire. At present, using surface temperature sensor to measure the temperature of LIBs is the main method. High-capacity LIB packs used in electric vehicles and grid-tied stationary energy storage system essentially consist of thousands of individual LIB cells. Therefore, installing a physical sensor at each cell, especially at the cell core, is not practically feasible from the solution cost, space, and weight point of view. So developing a new method for battery temperature prediction has become an urgent problem to be solved. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a widely applied non-destructive method of characterization of LIBs. In recent years, methods of predicting LIBs temperature by EIS have been developed. The prediction of LIBs temperature based on EIS has the advantages of high real-time performance and prediction accuracy, and the device is simple and practical. The proposed method has a good development prospect in electric vehicles and other fields and can effectively solve the current problems of LIBs temperature prediction. Therefore, it is urgent to summarize these works to promote the next development. This review summarizes the main methods of using EIS to predict the temperature of LIBs in recent years, including the methods based on the impedance, phase shift, and intercept frequency. The principle and application of various methods are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of different methods and the future development direction are discussed. Highlights Use EIS to quickly and effectively predict the internal temperature changes of LIBs. No hardware temperature sensors and thermal model are required. The methods to predict battery temperature based on impedance, phase shift, and intercept frequency are reviewed.},

  abstract = {With an increasingly wider application of the lithium-ion battery (LIB), specifically the drastic increase of electric vehicles in cosmopolitan cities, improving the thermal and fire resilience of LIB systems is inevitable. Thus, in-depth analysis and performance-based study on battery thermal management system (BTMs) design have arisen as a popular research topic in energy storage systems. Among the LIB system parameters, such as battery temperature distribution, battery heat generation rate, cooling medium properties, electrical properties, physical dimension design, etc., multi-factor design optimisation is one of the most difficult experimental tasks. Computational simulations deliver a holistic solution to the BTMs design, yet it demands an immense amount of computational power and time, which is often not practical for the design optimisation process. Therefore, machine learning (ML) models play a non-substitute role in the safety management of battery systems. ML models aid in temperature prediction and safety diagnosis, thereby assisting in the early warning of battery fire and its mitigation. In this review article, we summarise extensive lists of literature on BTMs employing ML models and identify the current state-of-the-art research, which is expected to serve as a much-needed guideline and reference for future design optimisation. Following that, the application of various ML models in battery fire diagnosis and early warning is illustrated. Finally, the authors propose improved approaches to advanced battery safety management with ML. This review paper aims to bring new insights into the application of ML in the LIB thermal safety issue and BTMs design and anticipate boosting further advanced battery system design not limited to the thermal management system, as well as proposing potential digital twin modelling for BTMs.},

A set of Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide (NCA), Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO) and Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO) Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with 25--100\% state of charge (SOC) was externally heated-to-fire. From the experimental results, we generated empirical equations to predict the onset of thermal runaway (TRonset) and hazards such as maximum surface temperature (Tsurf), and flame temperature (Tflame) except for LMO LIBs due to their violent explosions. To demonstrate the accuracy of predictions, we compared the results predicted with another set of test data from the same LIBs but different SOCs and evaluated the accuracy using percentage error (\%Er). The developed empirical equations achieved higher prediction accuracy, with the TRonset reaching the \%Er of less than 10\% for both NCA and LCO LIBs. The lower SOC (20\%) showed the greatest discrepancy, with the maximum \%Er of 2.7 and 7.4\% in LCO and NCA, respectively. A large variation of \%Er in Tsurf was observed regardless of SOC due to violent explosion, and \%Er reached the maximum of 15.4\% and 24.0\% in NCA and LCO, respectively. In Tflame, the highest \%Er observed for NCA and LCO are 25.6\% and 29.9\%, respectively. Overall, \%Er show no correlation with SOC in any of the TRonset, Tsurf and Tflame predictions. LMO as the most energy dense of the three LIB samples, many of them ruptured violently during the test. In light of the growing demand for energy dense LIBs, new empirical equations should include ruptured samples as well.},

The application of the lithium-ion batteries which previously circulating and contained around small-scale electronics is now expanding into large scale emerging markets such as electromobility and stationary energy storage. Therefore, the understanding of the risk involved is imperative. Thermal runaway is the most common failure mode of lithium-ion battery which may lead to safety incidents. Transport process of immense amounts of heat released during thermal runaway of lithium-ion battery to neighboring batteries in a module can lead to cascade failure of the whole energy storage system. In this work, a model is developed to predict the propagation of lithium-ion battery in a module for large scale applications. For this purpose, kinetic of material thermal decomposition is combined with heat transfer modelling. The simulation is built based on chemical kinetics at component level of a singular cell and energy balance that accounts for conductive and convective heat transfer.},

Here, we present a customized LIB setup developed for early detection of electrode temperature rise during simulated thermal runaway tests incorporating a modern additive manufacturing-supported resistance temperature detector (RTD). An advanced RTD is embedded in a 3D printed polymeric substrate and placed behind the electrode current collector of CR2032 coin cells that can sustain harsh electrochemical operational environments (acidic electrolyte without Redox, short-circuiting, leakage etc.) without participating in electrochemical reactions. The internal RTD measured an average 5.8\,{$^\circ$}C higher temperature inside the cells than the external RTD with almost 10 times faster detection ability, prohibiting thermal runaway events without interfering in the LIBs' operation. A temperature prediction model is developed to forecast battery surface temperature rise stemming from measured internal and external RTD temperature signatures.},

This model only requires a minimum number of input parameters, and some of these unknown parameters can be obtained from accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) tests and previous studies, removing the need for detailed measurements of heat flow of cell components by differential scanning calorimetry. The model was firstly verified by ARC tests for a commercial cylindrical 21700 cell for the prediction of the cell surface temperature evolution with time. It was further validated by uniform heating tests of 21700 cells conducted with flexible and nichrome-wire heaters, respectively. The validated model was finally used to investigate the critical ambient temperature that triggers battery TR. The predicted critical ambient temperature is between 127 {$^\circ$}C and 128 {$^\circ$}C. The model has been formulated as lumped 0D, axisymmetric 2D and full 3D to suit different heating and geometric arrangements and can be easily extended to predict the TR evolution of other LIBs with different geometric configurations and cathode materials.

Timely and fast battery thermal runaway prognosis is essential but restricted by limited parameters and complex influencing factors during real-world operation of EVs, i.e., environment, driving behavior, and weather. To cope with the issue, several data-driven methods are combined, and the thermal runaway prognosis is realized by two steps, i.e., temperature prediction by the modified extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and then abnormality detection by the principal component analysis (PCA) and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The XGBoost is modified and trained by data of real-world EVs to couple the influencing factors during the real-world operation of EVs. For parameter optimization, the ``pretraining and adjacent grid optimizing method'' (P-AGOM) and the ``adjacent grid optimizing method'' (AGOM) are proposed to achieve locally optimal hyperparameters for XGBoost and DBSCAN. Verified results showcase that the XGBoost-PCA-DBSCAN achieves accurate 5-min-forward temperature prediction, and the mean square errors (mses) of four seasons are only 0.0729, 0.0594, 0.0747, and 0.0523, respectively. By modification of XGBoost, the mse of temperature prediction is reduced by 31.2\%. In addition, the 35-min-forward thermal runaway prognosis by the XGBoost-PCA-DBSCAN will provide the driver sufficient response time to minimize the loss of life and property.},

  abstract = {Thermal runaway (TR) propagation is triggered in a battery pack by abnormalities such as a cell fire or explosion, which leads to severe consequences. Predicting the TR propagation is challenging due to the complex, high non-linearity, and uncertain disturbances of TR. This paper establishes an electro-thermal coupling simulation model of TR propagation to supplement experimental data and public datasets for model training and verification. Then, a data-driven fusion model named Multi-Mode and Multi-Task Thermal Propagation Forecasting Neural Network (MMTPFNN) is established quantitative advance multi-step prediction of TR propagation in Li-ion battery modules, and a temperature-based TR propagation grading warning strategy is proposed. The TR propagation is mainly influenced by the thermal characteristics of surrounding batteries, and the temperature distribution in the entire battery module is of great significance to the prediction of TR propagation. Herein, the model is presented by using the thermal image and the discrete operating data of cells. Furthermore, because TR is a small probability event, obtaining the thermal image of the battery module requires additional system memory and computational resources. A switching strategy of the prediction model is established to improve the applicability of the model with the temperature threshold of 60~{$^\circ$}C. When the battery is in a safe temperature range (below 60~{$^\circ$}C), the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is run to predict the battery temperature. Once the battery temperature is detected above 60~{$^\circ$}C, the thermal image is captured, and the MMTPFNN model is run to predict the TR propagation. In the validation section, different network structures are discussed, and different time resolutions and different window settings of the MMTPFNN are compared. Finally, the early warning strategy with three alert levels is introduced, and the effectiveness of the warning strategy with different window settings and initial SoCs is further discussed.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries have many advantages such as the high specific energy, the high specific power, the long calendar life, being environmentally friendly, and can be used without the memory effect. Thus this type of battery is widely used as the core component in many applications such as electric vehicles, portable electronic devices, and distributed energy storage systems. However, lithium-ion batteries can easily develop into thermal runaways due to the stress and abuse from mechanical, electrical, and thermal perspectives, posing a major threat to the overall safety of many battery systems. On the premise of passing the manufacturer's safety inspections, a variety of methods for monitoring and detecting thermal runaway events are developed to enhance the safety and robustness of lithium-ion batteries in different application scenarios. This paper thus summarizes the existing literature on this topic and presents a comparative study on the sensitivity of various monitoring and detection methods. Potential future research directions are also discussed in detail to further enhance the safety and robustness of lithium-ion battery systems.},

Accurate thermal-electric estimation is significant for the safety of lithium-ion batteries (LIB). To predict the highly correlated behavior of temperature and voltage variation characteristics during the TR process, a thermal-electric coupled TR model within the full range of State of Charge (SOC) is constructed in this study. The electric quantity normalized concentration ceq is defined and used to construct the corresponding numerical relationship between temperature and voltage in the model. This model can effectively fit the battery TR temperature and voltage variation behavior under both adiabatic TR test and oven test results. Furthermore, the model-based analysis proves that the temperature and voltage changes during the TR can be mutually obtained through the stable numerical coupling relationship. Besides, the relationship between SOC and the concentration field is established. Moreover, the feasibility of using the normalized concentration to couple the voltage and temperature signal is verified. This study provides perspectives for the coupling relationships of TR characteristic signals and multi-signal coupled modeling of lithium-ion battery TR.},

However, fire and explosion accidents caused by thermal runaway have attracted widespread attention. Studies have shown that lithium plating of Li-ion batteries during low-temperature aging can seriously affect their thermal stability. Still, there is no corresponding mathematical model to analyze and predict the thermal runaway behavior of batteries during the whole life cycle after low-temperature aging. In this paper, the evolution of thermal runaway behaviors and kinetics caused by the low-temperature aging is analyzed by the stage division and analysis of the thermal runaway process based on the adiabatic thermal runaway tests. The results show that the low-temperature aging significantly affects the thermal kinetics of the battery and accelerates the thermal runaway process. By investigating several groups of experimental results, a prediction method for the kinetic parameters of side reactions of batteries with arbitrary state of health (SOH) is proposed, and a numerical model for the prediction of thermal runaway during the whole life cycle is established based on the reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the proposed model is experimentally verified to accurately predict the thermal runaway behaviors of Li-ion batteries during the whole life cycle after low-temperature aging.},

The modelling of TR is difficult due to the broad range of cell properties and potential conditions. Understanding the effect that thermo-physical and heat transfer characteristics have on the TR abuse model output is essential to develop more accurate and robust TR models. This study uses global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to investigate the effect of the cell parameters on the outcome of TR events. Using a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model to calculate the Sobol' indices, it is shown that the emissivity value is the dominant thermo-characteristic throughout the overall abuse scenario. Further analysis, investigating three key TR features shows the conductivity coefficient to be the most important with respect to the maximum temperature reached during TR. Results demonstrate that researchers can confidently estimate some thermo-characteristics but require accurate characterisation of the emissivity and conductivity coefficient to ensure robust predictions. Given the importance of battery technology to aid in global de-carbonisation, these findings are key to increasing their safe design and operation.},

While much work has been done on understanding the kinetics of various heat generation processes during thermal runaway, relatively lesser work exists on understanding how heat removal from the cell influences thermal runaway. Through a unified analysis of heat generation and heat removal, this paper derives and experimentally validates a non-dimensional parameter whose value governs whether or not thermal runaway will occur in a Li-ion cell. This parameter is named the Thermal Runaway Number (TRN), and comprises contributions from thermal transport within and outside the cell, as well as the temperature dependence of heat generation rate. Experimental data using a 26650 thermal test cell are in good agreement with the model, and demonstrate the dependence of thermal runaway on various thermal transport and heat generation parameters. This parameter is used to predict the thermal design space in which the cell will or will not experience thermal runaway. By combining all thermal processes contributing to thermal runaway in a single parameter, this work contributes towards a unified understanding of thermal runaway, and provides the fundamental basis for design tools for safe, high-performance Li-ion batteries.},

However, the TRP prediction is challenging because of the substantial uncertainty and hard-to-acquire data. To solve this problem, a fuzzy system and multi-task CNN-LSTM method are proposed to predict TRP multiple steps ahead. The TRP dataset is constructed by 25 sets of experiments and 130 sets of simulations. The uncertain SoC, charging and discharging conditions, and thermal runaway (TR) trigger points are considered in both experiments and simulations. Then, the fuzzy system is introduced to reason about the TR probability of the battery and optimized by a sparrow search algorithm (SSA). A multi-task CNN-LSTM model is proposed to extract fuzzy and physical information by employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) and multiple long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, respectively, and output the temperature of multiple cells simultaneously. Finally, the models are evaluated in the simulation and experimental validation sets with different window lengths and time resolutions. The results show that the fuzzy information significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the method, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 98.48\% for the 3s prediction horizon and 97.27\% for the 18s prediction horizon in the experimental validation set.},

Specifically, the network is trained using data from a high-fidelity model of an LIB, which describes TR by addressing several coupled partial differential equations. Quantitative analysis reveals that the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of the MPINN for TR estimation are less than an artificial neural network (ANN) by 0.71 and 1.57, respectively, when using fully labeled data for training. It outperforms the ANN in terms of MAE and RMSE by 90.56 and 118.64, when only a small portion of labeled data (semi-supervision) are used for TR prediction. Importantly, it predicts TR without any labeled data when the decomposition of reactive species is modeled in the positive electrode. The MPINN exhibits promising results in surrogate modeling, implying it can be successfully implemented in practical scenarios and stimulate further research related to TR modeling using physics-informed deep learning.},

  abstract = {Remaining-useful-life (RUL) prediction of Li-ion batteries is used to provide an early indication of the expected lifetime of the battery, thereby reducing the risk of failure and increasing safety. In this paper, a detailed method is presented to make long-term predictions for the RUL based on a combination of gated recurrent unit neural network (GRU NN) and soft-sensing method. Firstly, an indirect health indicator (HI) was extracted from the charging processes using a soft-sensing method that can accurately describe power degradation instead of capacity. Then, a GRU NN with a sliding window was applied to learn the long-term performance development. The method also uses a dropout and early stopping method to prevent overfitting. To build the models and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a real-world NASA battery data set with various battery measurements was used. The results show that the method can produce a long-term and accurate RUL prediction at each position of the degradation progression based on several historical battery data sets.},

  abstract = {Currently, the thermal safety issue of lithium-ion battery (LIB) has become a major challenge to restrict its development. In this work, the thermal runaway propagation (TRP) process of the 18,650-type LIB module is studied by experimental and modeling methods. A novel experimental-based Domino prediction model is proposed, which can predict the TRP path and its probability. The calculation part of the model is realized with the Matlab software. This model for the first time proposes that whether the battery thermal runaway (TR) is a probability event, and the probability is a function of its temperature. To verify the feasibility of the model, the TRP process in a 4~{\texttimes}~4 arrangement battery module with three different first TR battery locations is detailed analyzed. The results show that the dangerous level ranking of cell locations from low to high is the corner location, the edge location, and the location near the module center. Higher dangerous level means more maximum probability TRP paths and higher probability. Moreover, it was found that the whole TRP process can be divided into four stages: the TRP trigger stage, the heat accumulation stage, the Domino effect stage, and the TRP stop stage. The proposed model can effectively predict the TRP process in modules, and the results have important reference value for the design of the battery thermal management system and the research on the method of blocking TRP.},

This article discovers that the slope of the dynamic impedance in the frequency band of 30--90 Hz turns positive from negative when the cell just starts to overcharge and proposes the theoretical explanation. Taking 70 Hz impedance as an example, the thermal runaway accident can be successfully avoided by cutting off the charging when the slope turns positive from negative during charging. The warning time is 580 s ahead of the thermal runaway. This feature is easy to identify and requires no complex mathematical models and parameters. Besides, the prediction method based on this feature can be conducted by using an online dynamic impedance measurement device designed by us, which is suitable for large-scale applications.

Temperature rise prediction is crucial for LiB safety management in an all-climate electric vehicles application because many disastrous consequences are caused by high temperature. This study mainly investigates the ESC-caused temperature rise characteristics of LiB, and proposes an online prediction approach of the maximum temperature rise. Three original contributions are made: (1) Abusing tests of LiBs under ESC are conducted at varying ambient temperatures, and the influences of battery state of charge (SOC) and ambient temperature on the maximum temperature rise are revealed. (2) Characteristics of temperature rises are analysed, therein finding that the heat generation of LiBs caused by ESC presents two modes: Joule heat-dominant mode and reaction heat/Joule heat blended mode; leakage is an external manifestation of the latter. (3) Two heat generation modes are proved to be linearly separable at temperature rise discharge capacity plane, and then a two-step prediction approach of maximum temperature rise is proposed based on support vector machine. Finally, the presented approach is validated by the experimental data. The maximum temperature rise can be predicted up to 22.3\,s ahead of time and very precise prediction results are obtained, where the mean prediction error for the eight test cells is 3.05\%.},

Li-ion battery systems require the use of a battery management system (BMS) to perform safely and efficiently. Accurate and reliable battery modeling is important for the BMS to function properly. Currently, many BMS applications use the equivalent circuit model due to its simplicity. However, with the development of a cloud BMS, machine learning battery models can be utilized, which can potentially improve the accuracy and reliability of the BMS. This work investigates the performance of four different machine learning models used to predict the thermal (temperature) and electrical (voltage) behaviors of Li-ion battery cells. A prismatic Li-ion battery cell with a capacity of 25 Ah was cycled under a constant current profile at three different ambient temperatures, and the surface temperature and voltage of the battery were measured. The four machine learning regression models---linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and decision tree---were developed using the scikit-learn library in Python and validated with experimental data. The results of their performance were reported and compared using the R2 metric. The decision tree-based model, with an R2 score of 0.99, was determined to be the best model in this case study.},

  abstract = {Accurate monitoring of capacity degradation of a lithium-ion battery is important as it enables the user to manage the battery usage for optimal performance/lifetime and to take preemptive measures against any potential explosion or fire. Battery capacity fades gradually through repetitive charging and discharging until it reaches the so called `knee-point', after which it goes through rapid and irreversible deterioration to reach its end-of-life. It is crucial to forecast the knee-point early and accurately for safety and economic use of the battery. Machine learning based methods have been used to predict the knee-point with early cycles cell data. Despite some notable progress made, the existing methods make the unrealistic assumption of constant cycle-to-cycle charge/discharge operation. In this study, a novel two-stage deep learning method is proposed for online knee-point prediction under variable battery usage. A CNN-based model extracts temporal features across past and current cycles to sort out those that should be monitored closely for near-term failures, and then predict the number of cycles left to reach the knee-point for them. The proposed method extracts features from time-series data and thus reflects dynamic changes in battery properties, resulting in improved prediction performance under realistic scenarios.},

In this work, we present a novel Time-Series Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (TS-WGAN) approach for SOC estimation of lithium-ion batteries, characterized by a well-designed data preprocessing process and a distinctive WGAN-GP architecture. In the data preprocessing stage, we employ the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to identify strongly associated features and apply feature scaling techniques for data normalization. Moreover, we leverage polynomial regression to expand the original features and utilize principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the computational load and retain essential information by projecting features into a lower-dimensional subspace. Within the WGAN-GP architecture, we originally devise a Transformer as the generator and a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) as the critic to make the most of local (CNN) and global (Transformer) variables. The overall model is trained with the WGAN, incorporating gradient penalty loss for training purposes. Simulation outcomes using real-road dataset and laboratory dataset reveal that TS-WGAN surpasses all baseline methods with enhanced accuracy, stability, and robustness. The coefficient of determination (R2) for both datasets exceeds 99.50\%, demonstrating its potential for practical application.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in the electric vehicle industry due to their recyclability and long life. However, a failure of lithium-ion batteries can cause some catastrophic accidents, such as electric car battery explosion fires and so on. To prevent such harm from occurring, it is essential to monitor the remaining useful life of lithium-ion batteries and give early warning. In this paper, an adaptive noise reduction approach is proposed to predict the RUL (Remaining Useful Life) of lithium-ion batteries, which uses CEEMDAN (Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise) combined with wavelet decomposition to achieve adaptive noise reduction decomposition, and then inputs the obtained IMF (Intrinsic Mode Function) components into LS--RVM (Least Square Relevance Vector Machine) for training, prediction, and reconstruction, so as to achieve high-precision prediction of RUL. Moreover, in order to verify the validity of the model, the model in this paper is compared with other common models. The results demonstrate that the RMSE, MAPE, and MAE of the proposed model are 0.008678, 0.005002, and 0.006894, and that it has higher accuracy than the other common prediction models.},

The memory cell of the LSTM is modified and the resultant modified LSTM-CNN serves to provide accurate battery temperature prediction.

The thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries is the phenomenon of chain exothermic reactions within the battery. These reactions cause a sharp rise in the internal battery temperature causing the inner structures of the battery to destabilize and degrade, which eventually leads to the failure of the battery. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the key aspects of the thermal runaway processes, which consists of thermal runaway initiation mechanisms, thermal runaway propagation, and the characterization of vented gases during the thermal runaway process. Thermal runaway is a major safety concern; therefore, the development of mathematical and numerical models to predict thermal runaway is reviewed, which provides useful data to design and develop battery packs with thermal runaway safety features. Furthermore, the development of effective battery thermal management systems is discussed, which is essential to prevent thermal runaway initiation. Finally, mitigation strategies are reviewed, which are developed to contain and minimize damages when thermal runaway occurs.},

However, it is difficult to track state of health in real-time to predict and improve accuracy. This article selects the ternary lithium-ion battery as the research object. Based on the cycle method and data-driven idea, the improved rain flow counting algorithm is combined with the autoregressive integrated moving average model prediction model to propose a new prediction for the battery state of health method. Experiments are carried out with dynamic stress test and cycle conditions, and a confidence interval method is proposed to fit the error range.

  abstract = {These documents explain the packages, tables, and reports in the Electricity and Gas Data Models. The MMS Data Model is the definition of the interface to participants of data published by AEMO from  the NEM system. A database conforming to the MMS Data Model can contain a local copy of all  current participant-specific data recorded in the main NEM production database. The target databases  have been called such names as the Participant Database, the Participant InfoServer and the Replica  Database.  The MMS Data Model includes database tables, indexes and primary keys. The model is currently  exposed as a physical model, so is different in presentation for each RDBMS. However, the same  logical model underlies all the physical models published by AEMO.  The MMS Data Model is the target model for products transferring data from AEMO to each  participant. Current product supplied by AEMO for data transfer is Participant Data Replication  (PDR), with some support for the superseded Parser.  Compatibility of the transfer products with the MMS Data Model is the responsibility of those  products and their configuration. AEMO's intention is to supply the data transfer products pre- configured to deliver data consistent with the MMS Data Model, noting differences where they occur  (e.g. for historical reasons).  Entity Diagrams  The entity diagrams show the key columns. Relationships have now been included in many cases.  Note:  The National Electricity Market registration classification of Yarwun Power Station Unit 1  (dispatchable unit ID: YARWUN\_1) is market non-scheduled generating unit. However, it is a  condition of the registration of this unit that the Registered Participant complies with some of the  obligations of a Scheduled Generator. This unit is dispatched as a scheduled generating unit with  respect to its dispatch offers, targets and generation outputs. Accordingly, information about  YARWUN\_1 is reported as scheduled generating unit information},

  abstract = {The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) made a rule on managing power system fault levels in  2017 1 (Fault Level Rule), which created a new framework in the National Electricity Rules (NER) for the  management of system strength.  The Fault Level Rule responded to a need to facilitate the safe and secure  operation of the National Electricity Market (NEM) power system with increasing levels of inverter-based  resources (IBR) 2.   The Fault Level Rule sought to ensure that adequate sources of system strength would remain available (or  be made available) to assist in the management of power system security and enable the secure operation of  IBR.  There are two parallel mechanisms in the NER to achieve this outcome:  minimum three-phase fault  levels to be maintained by transmission network service providers (TNSPs) for the power system to be in a  secure operating state, and obligations on connection applicants (primarily Generators) to remediate adverse  system strength impacts resulting from their connection (or alteration).  System strength is generally not well understood.  This document seeks to address some common  misunderstandings by presenting AEMO's views on:  {$\bullet$} The meaning of system strength.  {$\bullet$} The importance of system strength.  {$\bullet$} Relationship between system strength and other power system stability phenomena.  {$\bullet$} Assessing system strength.  {$\bullet$} Impact on system strength from new connections, and the application of system strength remediation.  {$\bullet$} System strength from a planning perspective},

  abstract = {Modern power systems are giant, multi-faceted machines. To operate the  complex `system of systems' in Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM),  AEMO oversees in aggregate millions of separate electricity supply and demand  decisions in real time, all day, every day.   The NEM, like power systems worldwide, is being transformed from a system dominated by large thermal  power stations, to a system including a multitude of power generation resources and technologies of various  sizes 1,2. At the same time, customers are engaging with their electricity supply in new ways.   The energy transformation involves a shift from:  {$\bullet$} Firm to variable energy sources.  {$\bullet$} Synchronous to inverter-based resource (IBR) generation.  {$\bullet$} A centralised to a decentralised system.  {$\bullet$} Passive to active consumers.  AEMO's challenge is to continually meet the needs of the power system, in the  face of major structural changes and the resulting uncertainty across investment and operational timeframes.   While the power system is being transformed, the laws of physics that determine electrical flows do not  change. To maintain a secure and reliable system, a range of interdependent technical and operational needs  must be met at all times.   Physically, the NEM operates on one of the world's longest interconnected power systems, stretching from  Port Douglas in Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia and across the Bass Strait to Tasmania -- a  distance of around 5,000 kilometres. By international standards, the NEM is unusually long and sparse, which  affects power system dynamics.  Interactions in any power system are highly complex and dynamic. Operating a power system involves a  continuum of decisions. AEMO needs to know what is happening in real time, and anticipate what is likely to  happen in the coming seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, years, even decades.   This work culminates in the continuous matching of supply with demand and constant provision of essential  voltage and frequency management services, ensuring sufficient reserves so the power system is robust  enough to cope with unexpected events and stay within the power system operational design limits.},

Grid forming inverters (GFI) control the flow of RES into grid, and help with blackstart, mimicking large power plants. ~They can inject voltage to help adjust frequency, and have been used for years in isolated grids. ~Most RES is connected only with grid-following inverter, which (AFIK from this article) follow the AC waveform, at whatever frequency it happens to be. ~GFI is not ``necessarily more expensive'' so recommendation to just always use them.
\par
Australia may be the world leader in large RES grid-forming inverters. ~In 2023, 3 already existed, with 3 ``in the works'', for a total of 480 MW. ~A couple are for S AUS wind plants, and 8 more RES/grid-forming projects are planned (2 GW more, 10X current GFI capacity).

Yet, such claims are often based on an arbitrary selection of elections, and inadequate statistical analysis. Using data on all presidential elections, we show that height is indeed an important factor in the US presidential elections. Candidates that were taller than their opponents received more popular votes, although they were not significantly more likely to win the actual election. Taller presidents were also more likely to be reelected. In addition, presidents were, on average, much taller than men from the same birth cohort. The advantage of taller candidates is potentially explained by perceptions associated with height: taller presidents are rated by experts as `greater', and having more leadership and communication skills. We conclude that height is an important characteristic in choosing and evaluating political leaders.},

The early frequency-domain features of the fault signals are extracted utilizing the high-frequency detail wavelet components, and a multilevel fault prognosis strategy is developed considering complex charging/driving characteristics under real-vehicle operating conditions. The verification results, implemented on loose wire connection batteries and real-scenario thermal runaway batteries, demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately extract and locate the hidden fault signals even under small magnitudes and effectively detecting and isolating battery faults before thermal runaway. Furthermore, significant reliability and stability of the proposed method are verified on more real-vehicle operation data, enabling online monitorable and traceable of battery faults before triggering thermal runaway, safeguarding drivers and passengers in real-world vehicular operation.},

Different approaches dealing with the onboard estimation of battery State-of-Charge (SoC) or State-of-Health (SoH) have been extensively discussed in various researches in the past. However, the topic of SoAP prediction has not been explored comprehensively yet. The prediction of the maximum power that can be applied to the battery by discharging or charging it during acceleration, regenerative braking and gradient climbing is definitely one of the most challenging tasks of battery management systems. In large lithium-ion battery packs because of many factors, such as temperature distribution, cell-to-cell deviations regarding the actual battery impedance or capacity either in initial or aged state, the use of efficient and reliable methods for battery state estimation is required. The available battery power is limited by the safe operating area (SOA), where SOA is defined by battery temperature, current, voltage and SoC. Accurate SoAP prediction allows the energy management system to regulate the power flow of the vehicle more precisely and optimize battery performance and improve its lifetime accordingly. To this end, scientific and technical literature sources are studied and available approaches are reviewed.},

Since not all battery cells are equipped with current sensors because of the space limitation and manufacturing cost, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based method is proposed to estimate the current of the short-circuited cell using only the voltage information, which is the feasible practice in electric vehicle application. Furthermore, the estimated current is used to predict maximum temperature increase as well as internal and surface temperature distribution of the ESC cell based on a 3D electro-thermal coupling model. Two experimental groups under constant current charging condition and constant power discharging condition are employed to validate the stability and accuracy of the proposed method. The results indicate that the rootmean-square-error between the estimated and measured current are 3.72 A and 6.61 A under the two validation experiments respectively, and the maximum estimation errors of temperature increase are 4.9 {$^\circ$}C and 7.3 {$^\circ$}C respectively.},

The question on how to ensure safety of billions of automotive batteries during their lifetime remains unanswered. In this study, we overcome the challenge by developing machine learning techniques based on the recorded data that are uploaded to the cloud. Using charging voltage and temperature curves from early cycles that are yet to exhibit symptoms of battery failure, we apply data-driven models to both predict and classify the sample data by health condition based on the observational, empirical, physical, and statistical understanding of the multiscale systems. The best well-integrated machine learning models achieve a verified classification accuracy of 96.3\% (exhibiting an increase of 20.4\% from initial model) and an average misclassification test error of 7.7\%. Our findings highlight the need for cloud-based artificial intelligence technology tailored to robustly and accurately predict battery failure in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the reliability of large scale battery storage systems consisting of multiple battery modules. The whole system reliability assessment is based on the reliability evaluation of system components including individual battery modules and power electronic converters. In order to evaluate the reliability of a battery module, a reliability model based on the state of health of individual battery cells is introduced. The state of health of a battery cell is calculated based on the capacity fade of the cell using a weighted Ampere-hour (Ah) throughput method. A universal generating function (UGF) based method is then introduced to evaluate the reliability of the battery module. The reliability model of DC/AC power electronic converters is also presented in the paper. The reliability analysis is conducted for battery storage systems with different system configurations and management strategies; and the influence of system configuration on the reliability of battery system is studied. Comparative studies are conducted for a classic battery energy storage system (BESS) and a reconfigurable battery energy storage system (RBESS) to demonstrate the advantages of having a reconfigurable system topology. The comparison results show that the proposed RBESS has higher system reliability and more power outputs than the classic BESS.},

However, IRENA Energy Transformation Scenario forecasts that these targets should be at 61\% and 9000~GWh to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and limit the global temperature rise within the twenty-first century to under 2~{$^\circ$}C. Despite widely known hazards and safety design of grid-scale battery energy storage systems, there is a lack of established risk management schemes and models as compared to the chemical, aviation, nuclear and the petroleum industry. Incidents of battery storage facility fires and explosions are reported every year since 2018, resulting in human injuries, and millions of US dollars in loss of asset and operation. Traditional risk assessment practices such as ETA, FTA, FMEA, HAZOP and STPA are becoming inadequate for accident prevention and mitigation of complex energy power systems. This work describes an improved risk assessment approach for analyzing safety designs in the battery energy storage system incorporated in large-scale solar to improve accident prevention and mitigation, via incorporating probabilistic event tree and systems theoretic analysis. The causal factors and mitigation measures are presented. The risk assessment framework presented is expected to benefit the Energy Commission and Sustainable Energy Development Authority, and Department of Standards in determining safety engineering guidelines and protocols for future large-scale renewable energy projects. Stakeholders and Utility companies will benefit from improved safety and reliability by avoiding high-cost asset damages and downtimes due to accident events.},

  abstract = {{$<$}abstract{$><$}p{$>$}Energy consumption increases daily across the world. Electricity is the best means that humankind has found for transmitting energy. This can be said regardless of its origin. Energy transmission is crucial for ensuring the efficient and reliable distribution of electricity from power generation sources to end-users. It forms the backbone of modern societies, supporting various sectors such as residential, commercial, and industrial activities. Energy transmission is a fundamental enabler of well-functioning and competitive electricity markets, supporting reliable supply, market integration, price stability, and the integration of renewable energy sources. Electric energy sourced from various regions worldwide is routinely traded within these electricity markets on a daily basis. This paper presents a review of forecasting techniques for intraday electricity markets prices, volumes, and price volatility. Electricity markets operate in a sequential manner, encompassing distinct components such as the day-ahead, intraday, and balancing markets. The intraday market is closely linked to the timely delivery of electricity, as it facilitates the trading and adjustment of electricity supply and demand on the same day of delivery to ensure a balanced and reliable power grid. Accurate forecasts are essential for traders to maximize profits within intraday markets, making forecasting a critical concern in electricity market management. In this review, statistical and econometric approaches, involving various machine learning and ensemble/hybrid techniques, are presented. Overall, the literature highlights the superiority of machine learning and ensemble/hybrid models over statistical models.{$<$}/p{$><$}/abstract{$>$}},

  abstract = {Batteries are crucial for building a clean and sustainable society, and their performance is highly affected by aging status. Reliable battery health assessment, however, is currently restrained by limited access to sufficient aging data, resulting from not only complicated battery operations but also long aging experimental time (several months or even years). Refining industrial datasets (e.g., the field data from electric vehicle batteries) unlocks opportunities to acquire large-volume aging data with low experimental efforts. We introduce the potential of combining industrial data with accelerated aging tests to recover high-quality battery aging datasets, through a migration-based machine learning. A comprehensive dataset containing 8,947 aging cycles with 15 operational modes is collected for evaluation. While saving up to 90\% experimental time, aging data can be recovered with ultra-low error within 1\%. It provides an alternative solution to significantly improve data shortage issues for assessment of battery and energy storage aging.},

This is a way to generate a ton of near-lab-quality capacity trajectories from operational industrial batteries, but you still have to wait for the end of the operational battery lifespan. The generated data can be used to train accurate capacity models for similar industrial batteries (I think it says), as well as for other prediction targets, like SOH, although this is not tested. ~Capacity result is very accurate: {$<$}1\% RMSE with only 3 capacity tests throughout the battery life (which 3\% of the time needed for laboratory test).

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\par
lab tests are expensive
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item hundreds or thousands of equivalent cycles
\item several months to a year (but a year is shorter than waiting for the industrial batteries used for modeling to die, isn't it?)

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{industrial data is a huge}, if compromised, source; Chinese example has 1M more points than the open MIT-Standford battery aging dataset (mentions CALC and NASA sets too)
\item \textbf{industrial data normally not suitable} for model training: doesn't cover the range of operation or full charge/discharge
\item important to evenly space the 3 capacity tests

\end{itemize}

\par

\par
\subsubsection{Method}

\par
Use industrial batteries in operation to generate accurate aging (capacity degradation) models without frequent capacity measurements (only 3, spread through battery's lifespan) using large data sets of batteries in operation, not following any cycling experiments.
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item Do a laboratory accelerated test on a test battery of the same type (I think), measuring the capacity trajectory and collecting, \textbf{x}, corresponding sets of voltages, currents, temp (I think).
\item Train a base model, a simple 3 layer NN to predict the capacity given \textbf{x}. ~I think they're predicting \emph{incremental capacity} ``IC'' (Tang et al., 2021, p. 2).
\item On the target battery (the with only industrial data), do 3 or so laboratory capacity tests, at 0\%, 50\% and 100\% the battery's lifespan (during industrial operation, I guess). ~
\item 
\par
Generate fake target battery capacity data between the lab tests
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item predict capacity using the base model
\item correct by interpolating from the laboratory capacity tests. ~They call this piecewise linear, but \emph{I don't quite get it.}

\end{enumerate}

\item Use fake target battery capacities to train other models, I guess.\\

This paper comprehensively reviews the research status, technical challenges, and development trends of state estimation of lithium-ion batteries. First, the key issues and technical challenges of battery state estimation are summarized from three aspects of characteristics, models, and algorithms, and the technical challenges in state estimation are deeply analyzed. Second, four typical battery states (state of health, state of charge, state of energy, and state of power) and their joint estimation methods are reviewed, and feasible estimation frameworks are proposed, respectively. Finally, the development trends of state estimation are prospected. Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud networking have further reshaped battery state estimation, bringing new methods to estimate the state of the battery under complex and extreme operating conditions. The research results provide a valuable reference for battery state estimation in the next-generation battery management system.},

However, as with all energy sources, batteries  carry a certain risk of failure. For LIB this can result in  gassing and burning, potentially harming people and  property. The ongoing trend towards ever higher energy  densities literally adds fuel to the fire.  Figure 1 shows the trade-offs typically made in the design  of LIB. To achieve higher energy densities, manufacturers  use more reactive materials while minimizing safety  margins. With more energy stored in a single battery,  larger amounts of energy are released in case of a failure.   With the fast growth of the battery industry, the number  of battery incidents has also increased. One prominent  example is the 2019 fire at an APS site in McMicken,  Arizona. A battery failure led to a massive explosion in one  of the storage containers, causing millions in damages  and hospitalizing several firefighters.

The MO combines these with demand forecasts to produce equilibrium prices and instructs firms on their dispatch. We incorporate the possibility that generating firms may rebid (or revise) their supply schedule prior to dispatch - an important feature of markets in many countries which has not previously been included in theoretical models. We show that a dominant firm can gain substantially by manipulating its bids, and take advantage of the opportunity to submit rebids. In the Australian National Energy Market (NEM) where settlement prices are an average of six dispatch prices, it can, for example, withhold capacity at lower prices for the first bid in a period, creating a price hike, and then add capacity at lower prices to ensure dispatch. Using data from the Australian NEM we provide the first empirical evidence consistent with the hypothesized theoretical behaviour in the observed data.},

As we continue to deploy BESSs, it becomes increasingly important for us to understand how these systems age and accurately predict their performance over time. This knowledge is essential for ensuring that the systems operate optimally and can be properly maintained. Since the structure of a BESS is different from a single electrochemical cell, the existing models at the cell level cannot predict and estimate the life of the BESS with suitable accuracy. Furthermore, the test protocols available at the cell level mostly cannot be executed at the BESS level for many reasons. Therefore, in this paper, a review of test protocols for building aging models for BESSs has been performed. After reviewing the protocols for a single electrochemical cell and addressing the differences between BESSs and cells, a review of the works performed on a larger scale has been carried out, and the possible ways for testing the BESS for aging models were investigated.},

  abstract = {The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is undergoing rapid change as utility-scale wind, solar and now battery storage technologies enter the market. The impact of these changes on the operation of the NEM is of interest to a potentially wide range of stakeholders including researchers, market participants, consultants and energy NGOs. Detailed operational data is essential in assisting these stakeholders to understand these impacts and possible future outcomes in the NEM. Open data and open-source software for energy are increasingly seen as key to improving transparency and reproducibility, and therefore productive discussion on energy policy and market reform amongst a wide range of stakeholders. There is an excellent opportunity to further these aims in the NEM, due to high levels of transparency around market data, with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) releasing nearly all the data used in the central dispatch process. However, a significant processing and interpretation overhead exists when analysing the large and often complex datasets made available to the public. This paper reports on a new open-source software tool, NEMOSIS NEM Open Source Information Service, NEMOSIS, which aims to lower this overhead and improve the accessibility of data sourced from AEMO. While a number of similar proprietary tools exist and are widely used by industry stakeholders, NEMOSIS offers additional benefits. It is completely open to modification and extension with the source code available on GitHub, while also being highly portable with the ability to package the tool as an executable file and operate it via a graphical user interface. It complements some other open source data tools for the NEM by providing access to a wide selection of data without the need for the user to have any coding knowledge. To demonstrate the use of NEMOSIS, this paper presents two examples of how it can be used to assess utility-scale renewable generator performance; firstly, with a simple example that outlines how to access 5 minute dispatch data for all scheduled generators in the NEM, and then, a second more complex example explains the implementation of a custom data table of plant performance statistics.},

  abstract = {The recent introduction of five-minute settlements into the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) in October 2021 saw a massive increase in the number of offers submitted to the market at every five-minute Dispatch Interval. While many of these offers were from non-renewable generators, a significant proportion was now from Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) Generators that had rarely submitted offers to the market before the market change. VRE generators use various approaches to actively manage their market risks, including internal and external multi-generator operations centres, advanced Machine Learning optimisers and simple single generator revenue optimisers. This paper will discuss the advantages and risks of all three approaches, how each has operated in the market, and how strategies adapt to the dynamic competitive energy and ancillary markets. Surprisingly, the simple and usually lower-cost option of a simple revenue optimisation seems to provide a low-risk, reliable and robust alternative for VRE generators and can also be combined with other systems to meet VRE compliance and other operational priorities generators. More sophisticated systems are required for multi-modal and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) as the forecast horizon needs to consider an entire trading day operations due to the physical constraints of the Lithium-Ion technology. However, the same revenue optimisation approach can work for other battery technologies, such as supercapacitors, that do not have the cycle constraints of Lithium-Ion and are especially suited to providing frequency and contingency ancillary services.},

  abstract = {VPPs (Virtual Power Plants) play an important role in balancing supply and demand. In order to make VPP revenue, it is necessary to forecast market prices and bidding energy for supply and demand adjustment markets, called FCAS (Frequency Control Ancillary Service) markets. However, price forecasting for FCAS markets is still challenging because they have multiple different response times and one price, directly and indirectly, influences each other. There is no study on electricity price forecasting in FCAS markets, and a novel forecasting model considering not only its price but also the other prices of the different response times is necessary. This work presents a market price forecasting model for a FCAS market by exploring the forecasting models derived from a wholesale market, and then it takes into account the markets with different response times as well as the target one from AEMO (Australian Energy Market Operator). Through the experiments, our forecasting model achieves 7.8\$/MWh of RMSE on the electricity price in AEMO's 6-Second-Raise market. The proposed forecasting model reduces RMSE by 80\% compared to the forecast price published by AEMO.},

  abstract = {Electricity is a commodity, which has many different attributes from other products because of its unique features. It needs a special infrastructure for production, transportation, and consumption.  In this thesis, the electricity system is discussed in two subsystems. The flow of electricity happens in the technical subsystem, and monetary value is discussed in the economic subsystem.     Here is an attempt to do a comprehensive review of three different marketplaces: AEMO in Australia, CAISO in California, and Nord Pool in Nordic countries based on literature review and available public information. In these marketplaces, there is continuous or upcoming reform of the energy system, which can be strengthened by integrating different perspectives from current markets. Characteristics for a successful electricity market are also proposed at the end of the thesis.     Currently, CAISO has a centralized wholesale energy market, while Nord Pool and AEMO have also decentralized properties. The critical issue with the centralized CAISO market is that they don't have intra-day pricing that can be updated continuously when the renewable generation changes. Whereas Nord Pool and AEMO with their decentralized intraday market, has the flexibility to adjust the price according to renewable energy production as close to real-time. This iterative intra-day trading can address the coordination problem related to wind and solar power generation. The downside is that there is a risk of network constrain, which can be improved by analysing the network in more detail.     The limitation of this study is using only three marketplaces where in the future it can be extended to more marketplaces},

This paper's aim is to answer the degree of how deep learning can contribute to forecasting prices thresholds in a volatile real-time electricity price market. Additional research in this area is required post NEM transition to a unified 5 minute dispatch and bidding cycle. Effective short term forecasting can enable the transition from manual to automatic bidding fully optimising the revenue potential for generators. The algorithms presented in this paper present an ultra-short horizon prediction forecasting of 15 minutes into the future. The Queensland wholesale electricity market price is used to present the research findings. Our results show deep learning models can achieve significant performance gains.},

This is kind-of opposed pandas DataFrames, which ~are more for ``tabular'' data in CSVs or SQL: 2D, and have labeled ~rows and columns (but you can do them both MultiIndex, and there is ``tall format'', in fact xarrays are easily converted to MultiIndex pd.DataFrames, so{\dots}). ~And, until pandas 2.0, I think, pandas is also np.array underneath.

\subsection{Data hierarchy}

\par
From bottom to top, it's:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{numpy.array:} n-dim, where n are the number of indices into the data (\emph{.data}). The contents are the values of a data variable e.g. `temperature'
\item \textbf{DataArray}: all the data for the data variable e.g. temperature, along with its indices (\emph{.coords }or \emph{.dims}, I don't understand the difference) and metainformation (\emph{.attrs})
\item \textbf{DataSet}: a dict-like thing containing all the DataArrays, with a key for dimension name (\emph{.dims}) ~e.g. `temperature'; the value is the DataArray. ~I think the indices are assumed the same for all of those DataArrays. ~True?

\end{itemize}

\par
This makes indexing easy
\par
\begin{quotation}

\par
\# plot the first timestep\\
lat = ds.air.lat.data ~\# numpy array\\
lon = ds.air.lon.data ~\# numpy array\\
temp = ds.air.data ~\# numpy array

plt.figure()\\
plt.pcolormesh(lon, lat, temp[0, :, :]);
\par
\end{quotation}

\subsection{Interesting bits}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\par
2D coordinates e.g. lat and lon, are described by row vectors, one for each dimension, of length N and D
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item They're blow out to NxD cells as you might expect: as arguments to pandas-like 2D plot functions
\item broadcasted when computing cross product

\end{itemize}

\item 
\par
computational arguments with mismatching coordinates
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item easy to check for matches with .align()
\item if unaligned, you'll get an empty dataarray in the computation output

\end{itemize}

\item 
\par
can do pandas-like things
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
\par
groupby and then reduce
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item TODO: try doing this to compute forecast error vs. horizon. ~Would be nice to use \href{https://github.com/raybellwaves/xskillscore-tutorial/tree/master}{xskillscore}

\end{itemize}

\item resample (for time): up or down
\item rolling: mean and others, I think, like in pandas
\item coarsen (downsample)
\item weighted: weight before reducing

\end{itemize}

\item time axes have datetime index things like time.season (you get a new coordinate in the aggregation like ``season''
\item plots methods are set up to do 2D plots w/ just .plot(), and also grouped plots e.g. 2D temp w/ plot for each season is just: ~\emph{seasonal\_mean.air.plot(col="season", col\_wrap=2);}
\item 
\par
can save in many formats: netCDF, HDF5, Matlab, \href{https://cupy.dev/}{CuPy }for GPU, even \href{https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/user-guide/io.html}{Amazon S3, using Zarr}{\dots}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item TODO: try/thinkabout how ot use xarray with S3, considering performance, as discussed in link above

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\par
easy to make interactive plots using \href{https://hvplot.holoviz.org/}{hvplot} library
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item TODO: try hvplot (works with pandas too). ~Maybe simpler than plotly?

Why AEMO started penalizing forecasters for errors, instead of rewarding them for ``errors that went in the right direction,'' like EPEX does with Reguleistung.
\par
Solar and Wind traders were able to predict times when over-frequency was likely, and so they over-forecasted their own generation. ~Then, they got paid to curtail their over-forecast to what it actually would have been without curtailing. ~This is was called price pumping.

  abstract = {Visual analytics is arguably the most important step in getting acquainted with your data. This is especially the case for time series, as this data type is hard to describe and cannot be fully understood when using for example summary statistics. To realize effective time series visualization, four requirements have to be met; a tool should be (1) interactive, (2) scalable to millions of data points, (3) integrable in conventional data science environments, and (4) highly configurable. We observe that open source Python visualization toolkits empower data scientists in most visual analytics tasks, but lack the combination of scalability and interactivity to realize effective time series visualization. As a means to facilitate these requirements, we created Plotly-Resampler, an open source Python library. Plotly-Resampler is an add-on for Plotly's Python bindings, enhancing line chart scalability on top of an interactive toolkit by aggregating the underlying data depending on the current graph view. Plotly-Resampler is built to be snappy, as the reactivity of a tool qualitatively affects how analysts visually explore and analyze data. A benchmark task highlights how our toolkit scales better than alternatives in terms of number of samples and time series. Additionally, Plotly-Resampler's flexible data aggregation functionality paves the path towards researching novel aggregation techniques. Plotly-Resampler's integrability, together with its configurability, convenience, and high scalability, allows to effectively analyze high-frequency data in your day-to-day Python environment.},

  abstract = {Visualization plays an important role in analyzing and exploring time series data. To facilitate efficient visualization of large datasets, downsampling has emerged as a well-established approach. This work concentrates on LTTB (Largest-Triangle-Three-Buckets), a widely adopted downsampling algorithm for time series data point selection. Specifically, we propose MinMaxLTTB, a two-step algorithm that marks a significant enhancement in the scalability of LTTB. MinMaxLTTB entails the following two steps: (i) the MinMax algorithm preselects a certain ratio of minimum and maximum data points, followed by (ii) applying the LTTB algorithm on only these preselected data points, effectively reducing LTTB's time complexity. The low computational cost of the MinMax algorithm, along with its parallelization capabilities, facilitates efficient preselection of data points. Additionally, the competitive performance of MinMax in terms of visual representativeness also makes it an effective reduction method. Experiments show that MinMaxLTTB outperforms LTTB by more than an order of magnitude in terms of computation time. Furthermore, preselecting a small multiple of the desired output size already provides similar visual representativeness compared to LTTB. In summary, MinMaxLTTB leverages the computational efficiency of MinMax to scale LTTB, without compromising on LTTB's favored visualization properties.

  abstract = {Typically, renewable-power-generation forecasting using machine learning involves creating separate models for each photovoltaic or wind park, known as single-task learning models. However, transfer learning has gained popularity in recent years, as it allows for the transfer of knowledge from source parks to target parks. Nevertheless, determining the most similar source park(s) for transfer learning can be challenging, particularly when the target park has limited or no historical data samples. To address this issue, we propose a multi-task learning architecture that employs a Unified Autoencoder (UAE) to initially learn a common representation of input weather features among tasks and then utilizes a Task-Embedding layer in a Neural Network (TENN) to learn task-specific information. This proposed UAE-TENN architecture can be easily extended to new parks with or without historical data. We evaluate the performance of our proposed architecture and compare it to single-task learning models on six photovoltaic and wind farm datasets consisting of a total of 529 parks. Our results show that the UAE-TENN architecture significantly improves power-forecasting performance by 10 to 19\% for photovoltaic parks and 5 to 15\% for wind parks compared to baseline models. We also demonstrate that UAE-TENN improves forecast accuracy for a new park by 19\% for photovoltaic parks, even in a zero-shot learning scenario where there is no historical data. Additionally, we propose variants of the Unified Autoencoder with convolutional and LSTM layers, compare their performance, and provide a comparison among architectures with different numbers of task-embedding dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of trained task embeddings for interpretation and visualization purposes.},

Gradient boosting builds a set of regression models in an iterative process, in which at each iteration, a regressor model is trained to reduce a given loss on a given objective. This paper proposes an extension of gradient boosting that can handle multi-task problems, that is, problems in which the tasks share the attribute space but not necessarily the data distribution. The objective of the proposed algorithm is to split the GB process into two phases, one in which the base models learn the multiple interconnected tasks simultaneously, and a second one, in which different models are built to optimize the loss function on each task. The performance of proposed model shows a better overall performance with respect to models that learn the tasks independently and all tasks together in several multi-task regression and classification problems.},

Boosting iteratively trains simple weak learners (just a little bit more accurate than random) to correct errors of the preceeding weak learner. ~It can do this by increasing the sample weight of samples where are gotten wrong (AdaBoost) or by predicting the resudual of the previous learner (Graident Boosting, like LightGBM and XGBOOST). ~

Despite this appeal, existing conformal methods can be unnecessarily conservative because they form intervals of constant or weakly varying length across the input space. In this paper we propose a new method that is fully adaptive to heteroscedasticity. It combines conformal prediction with classical quantile regression, inheriting the advantages of both. We establish a theoretical guarantee of valid coverage, supplemented by extensive experiments on popular regression datasets. We compare the efficiency of conformalized quantile regression to other conformal methods, showing that our method tends to produce shorter intervals.},

  abstract = {Conformalized quantile regression, a cutting-edge and model-agnostic algorithm, has emerged as a recent innovation to generate valid prediction intervals on finite samples while addressing heteroscedasticity. It starts by employing quantile regression to estimate conditional quantiles. Subsequently, these estimated conditional quantiles undergo a rectification process using conformal prediction. Under the assumption of exchangeability, a slightly weaker form of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, the resulting prediction intervals are valid in finite samples. However, a drawback of the proposed conformalization step is identified: it lacks the capacity to adapt to heteroscedasticity due to its independence from the input. To overcome this limitation, we propose an improvement that involves partitioning the covariates space into clusters, assigning higher weights to features with greater predictive power. Following that, within each cluster, a conformal step is applied, leveraging a rectification that is reliant on the input cluster-wise. To demonstrate the superiority of our improved version over the classic version of conformalized quantile regression, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of their respective prediction intervals using synthetic data.},

A short-term forecast is available from a  few hours before the forecasted time period and is  only extended a couple days into the future.  The  methods are supplied ensemble forecasts as input and  additionally the Conformal methods are supplied with  post-processed point forecasts for generating the  probability distributions.

The methods are compared  through a teaching schedule, to mimic a real-world  setting. For each model update in the teaching  schedule a grid-search approach is applied to select  each method's optimal hyperparameters, respectively.  The methods are tested out of the box with tweaks to  few hyperparameters. We also introduce a normalized  nonconformity score and use it with the conformal  method that handles data that violates the  exchangeability assumption. The resulting  probability distributions are compared to actual  wind measurements through Continuous Ranked  Probability Scores (CRPS) as well as their validity  and efficiency of certain prediction intervals.

We will cover the perspective(s) on calibration from the forecasting literature, where it is arguably the most developed. Instead of focusing solely on calibration, we'll cover some of the broader theory of forecasting, pertaining to scoring rules, calibration, and ensembles. There is a rich literature on forecast scoring and calibration. This literature has roots in statistics, but over the years it has been expanded and driven by applied forecasting disciplines, primarily weather forecasting. It is still quite an active area in terms of development: new results that seem foundational in nature are still being discovered year to year. As per our usual comment, what we cover in this lecture is only a sample of what is known in the theory of forecasting. Unlike other topics, we are not aware of a book that gives a modern and comprehensive treatment of forecast scoring rules, calibration, and so on. (Perhaps this would be premature, as these topics are still in active development, and such a book will come later.) One of the most active and influential researchers in forecasting theory today is Tilmann Gneiting, and much of what we cover will be drawing from his work with collaborators, such as Gneiting and Raftery (2007); Gneiting et al. (2007); Ranjan and Gneiting (2010); Gneiting and Ranjan (2013).},

Some versions of the interval scores commonly used in conformal prediction papers are both are proper, and tightly related to CRPS and QS. ~But then it seems to me that the log score might be better than any of these for rare events (also see (Taillardat et al., 2023) for more). ~Also, details about Bregman intervals and a lot on calibration (TODO: read that part)

\section{Scores}

\subsubsection{Relationship between CRSP, QS and interval scores}

\par
The interval score, IS, often used in conformal forecasting, does already both reward for sharpness and penalize miscoverage. ~A composite metric for a set of interval forecasts is the officially proper weighted interval score, WIS. ~Is WIS what I've always computed (``Evalcast Docs: weighted\_interval\_score'', 2024), but I just called it ``CRPS?''
\par
Anyway, CRPS can be used to define WIS/QS, but I don't quite get that either.
\par
Finally, this paper has a refined CRPS derivation that shows that it's the integrated QS -- I have the older, apparently not-quite-correct derivation in energy.bib somehwere. ~TODO someday: find that paper and link it.
\par
\subsubsection{Other scores}

\begin{itemize}

\item log score (proper)
\item quadratic score (proper)
\item log score aggressively penalizes rare event underconfidence
\item but CRPS is more ``modern,'' but in DE, I found that it was not so good at rare events.
\item what about the Energy Score? ~TODO an link to that, as Steven V found this was better for rare events, if I remember correctly.

We establish explicit bounds on the conditional and marginal coverage gaps of estimated prediction intervals, which asymptotically converge to zero under additional assumptions. We also provide similar bounds on the size of set differences between oracle and estimated prediction intervals. To implement this framework, we introduce an efficient algorithm called EnbPI, which utilizes ensemble predictors and is closely related to conformal prediction (CP) but does not require data exchangeability. Unlike other methods, EnbPI avoids data-splitting and is computationally efficient by avoiding retraining, making it scalable for sequentially producing prediction intervals. Extensive simulation and real-data analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of EnbPI compared to existing methods.},

  abstract = {Forecast evaluation is essential for the development of predictive epidemic models and can inform their use for public health decision-making. Common scores to evaluate epidemiological forecasts are the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and the Weighted Interval Score (WIS), which can be seen as measures of the absolute distance between the forecast distribution and the observation. However, applying these scores directly to predicted and observed incidence counts may not be the most appropriate due to the exponential nature of epidemic processes and the varying magnitudes of observed values across space and time. In this paper, we argue that transforming counts before applying scores such as the CRPS or WIS can effectively mitigate these difficulties and yield epidemiologically meaningful and easily interpretable results. Using the CRPS on log-transformed values as an example, we list three attractive properties: Firstly, it can be interpreted as a probabilistic version of a relative error. Secondly, it reflects how well models predicted the time-varying epidemic growth rate. And lastly, using arguments on variance-stabilizing transformations, it can be shown that under the assumption of a quadratic mean-variance relationship, the logarithmic transformation leads to expected CRPS values which are independent of the order of magnitude of the predicted quantity. Applying a transformation of log(x + 1) to data and forecasts from the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub, we find that it changes model rankings regardless of stratification by forecast date, location or target types. Situations in which models missed the beginning of upward swings are more strongly emphasised while failing to predict a downturn following a peak is less severely penalised when scoring transformed forecasts as opposed to untransformed ones. We conclude that appropriate transformations, of which the natural logarithm is only one particularly attractive option, should be considered when assessing the performance of different models in the context of infectious disease incidence.},

Exponential-in-nature epedidemiological forecasts should be somehow normalized before calculating CRPS/WIS. ~The reason is the scale changes rapidly, and gives more weight to forecasts at high magnitude stages of an epedimic. ~They use the log transform but suggest other transforms would be OK too.
\par
Such normalization changes model ranking based on CRPS/WIS more severely penalizing the missing of the start of an upswing, and less severly penalizing the missing of the start of the downswing.

In this context, classical verification methods tailored for extreme events, such as thresholded and weighted scoring rules, have undesirable properties that cannot be mitigated, and the well-known continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is no exception. In this paper, we define a formal framework for assessing the behavior of forecast evaluation procedures with respect to extreme events, which we use to demonstrate that assessment based on the expectation of a proper score is not suitable for extremes. Alternatively, we propose studying the properties of the CRPS as a random variable by using extreme value theory to address extreme event verification. An index is introduced to compare calibrated forecasts, which summarizes the ability of probabilistic forecasts for predicting extremes. The strengths and limitations of this method are discussed using both theoretical arguments and simulations.},

In concentrating solar power plants, the direct normal irradiance is the key variable in the system operation. However, direct normal irradiance is rarely measured as compared to global horizontal irradiance. There are several models that can be used to derive the direct normal irradiance from global horizontal irradiance. In this study, the Engerer model is used as a decomposition model, then evaluated against in situ observations at three ground stations: Seoul, Buan, and Jeju ground stations. The relative root mean square errors between the observed and direct normal irradiance estimated by the Engerer model are 15.0\%, 19.4\%, and 17.1\% at Seoul, Buan, and Jeju ground stations, respectively. The uncertainty of estimates is represented by the prediction interval from probabilistic prediction through Monte-Carlo simulation that employs the bias between estimation and ground truth for training datasets. The prediction interval for 90\% confidence level is 117.9\,W\,m-2 at the Seoul station, resulting from Monte-Carlo simulation. The prediction interval coverage probability is 92.8\%, implying that the probability that observed DNI is not included in the prediction interval is 7.2\%. The error metrics for probabilistic prediction indicates that Monte-Carlo simulation provides both valid and more informative estimations.},

  abstract = {The accurate prediction of electricity prices has great significance for the power system and the electricity market, regional electricity prices are difficult to predict due to congestion issues in regional transmission lines. A regional electricity price prediction framework is proposed based on an adaptive spatial--temporal convolutional network. The proposed framework is expected to better explore regional electricity prices' spatial--temporal dynamic characteristics in the electricity spot market and improve the predictive accuracy of regional electricity prices. First, different areas of the electricity market are regarded as nodes. Then, each area's historical electricity price data are used as the corresponding node's characteristic information and constructed into a graph. Finally, a graph containing the spatial--temporal information on electricity prices is input to the adaptive spatial--temporal prediction framework to predict the regional electricity price. Operational data from the Australian electricity market are adopted, and the prediction results from the proposed adaptive spatial--temporal prediction framework are compared with those of existing methods. The numerical example results show that the predictive accuracy of the proposed framework is better than the existing baseline and similar methods. In the twelve-step forecast example in this paper, considering the spatial dependence of the spot electricity price can improve the forecast accuracy by at least 10.3\% and up to 19.8\%.},

Short-term intraday trading becomes increasingly important due to the higher penetration of renewables. In Germany, the intraday electricity price typically fluctuates around the day-ahead price of the European Power EXchange (EPEX) spot markets in a distinct hourly pattern. This work proposes a probabilistic modeling approach that models the intraday price difference to the day-ahead contracts. The model captures the emerging hourly pattern by considering the four 15min intervals in each day-ahead price interval as a four-dimensional joint probability distribution. The resulting nontrivial, multivariate price difference distribution is learned using a normalizing flow, i.e., a deep generative model that combines conditional multivariate density estimation and probabilistic regression. Furthermore, this work discusses the influence of different external impact factors based on literature insights and impact analysis using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The normalizing flow is compared to an informed selection of historical data and probabilistic forecasts using a Gaussian copula and a Gaussian regression model. Among the different models, the normalizing flow identifies the trends with the highest accuracy and has the narrowest prediction intervals. Both the XAI analysis and the empirical experiments highlight that the immediate history of the price difference realization and the increments of the day-ahead price have the most substantial impact on the price difference.},

However, DL models are often quite sensitive to the used input normalization method, requiring extensive experimentation and fine-tuning to identify and apply the most appropriate method for different tasks. Even though trainable adaptive normalization methods have been recently proposed to overcome this to a certain extend, these methods also tend to remove useful information from the data, ignoring the global statistics of the input time series. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we propose a trainable adaptive normalization approach that is capable of both maintaining important mode information, since global statistics are employed for the normalization, as well as taking into account the current behavior of the time series and adjusting the normalization scheme to this. The effectiveness of the proposed method over baseline and state-of the-art normalization methods is demonstrated using extensive experiments on two different electric load forecasting datasets.},

  abstract = {Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we report some insightful findings to deeply analyze and understand our proposed SAN. We make our codes publicly available2.},

  abstract = {The study of Day-Ahead prices in the electricity market is one of the most popular problems in time series forecasting. Previous research has focused on employing increasingly complex learning algorithms to capture the sophisticated dynamics of the market. However, there is a threshold where increased complexity fails to yield substantial improvements. In this work, we propose an alternative approach by introducing an adaptive standardisation to mitigate the effects of dataset shifts that commonly occur in the market. By doing so, learning algorithms can prioritize uncovering the true relationship between the target variable and the explanatory variables. We investigate four distinct markets, including two novel datasets, previously unexplored in the literature. These datasets provide a more realistic representation of the current market context, that conventional datasets do not show. The results demonstrate a significant improvement across all four markets, using learning algorithms that are less complex yet widely accepted in the literature. This significant advancement unveils opens up new lines of research in this field, highlighting the potential of adaptive transformations in enhancing the performance of forecasting models.},

  abstract = {Data normalization is a fundamental preprocessing step for mining and learning from data. However, finding an appropriated method to deal with time series normalization is not a simple task. This is because most of the traditional normalization methods make assumptions that do not hold for most time series. The first assumption is that all time series are stationary, i.e., their statistical properties, such as mean and standard deviation, do not change over time. The second assumption is that the volatility of the time series is considered uniform. None of the methods currently available in the literature address these issues. This paper proposes a new method for normalizing non-stationary heteroscedastic (with non-uniform volatility) time series. The method, named Adaptive Normalization (AN), was tested together with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in three forecast problems. The results were compared to other four traditional normalization methods, and showed AN improves ANN accuracy in both short- and long-term predictions.},

Sliding min/max normalization but the min/max values used in normalization come from a lookup table, which matches some kind of summary statistics measured sometime recently, I think, e.g. mean/std. ~Also, min/max are quantiles, not literal min/max.
\par
Seems like you couldn't look too far back e.g. inflation would have shifted prices in the future and those old min/max values would be wrong. ~So, wouldn't you need to normalize those too?

  abstract = {Tree-based models have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks, including time series forecasting. They are increasingly in demand and widely accepted because of their comparatively high level of interpretability. However, many of them suffer from the overfitting problem, which limits their application in real-world decision-making. This problem becomes even more severe in online-forecasting settings where time series observations are incrementally acquired, and the distributions from which they are drawn may keep changing over time. In this context, we propose a novel method for the online selection of tree-based models using the TreeSHAP explainability method in the task of time series forecasting. We start with an arbitrary set of different tree-based models. Then, we outline a performance-based ranking with a coherent design to make TreeSHAP able to specialize the tree-based forecasters across different regions in the input time series. In this framework, adequate model selection is performed online, adaptively following drift detection in the time series. In addition, explainability is supported on three levels, namely online input importance, model selection, and model output explanation. An extensive empirical study on various real-world datasets demonstrates that our method achieves excellent or on-par results in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches as well as several baselines.},

Instead of adapting forecasting model inputs, use TreeSHAP to select from the most appropriate model, maybe spawn new models too.

  abstract = {By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.},

Thus, developing more accurate price modeling and forecasting techniques is a challenge for all market participants and regulatory authorities. This paper proposes a forecasting approach based on using auction data to fit supply and demand electricity curves. More specifically, we fit linear (LinX-Model) and logistic (LogX-Model) curves to historical sale and purchase bidding data from the Iberian electricity market to estimate structural parameters from 2015 to 2019. Then we use time series models on structural parameters to predict day-ahead prices. Our results provide a solid framework for forecasting electricity prices by capturing the structural characteristics of markets.},

  abstract = {The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is an energy-only zonal instance of the integrated pool model without a day-ahead market where a security-constrained economic- dispatch (SCED) engine controls dispatch and sets the price every 5 minutes. After a brief overview of pool markets across the world, this paper provides a detailed description of the NEM market design and price mechanism, drawn from a multitude of industry publications and the available auction data. Then to elucidate the NEM Dispatch Engine's process of wholesale price determination, a bid stack--type modelling framework is constructed from first principles with its suitability and limitations discussed against real-world examples from the NEM's SCED mechanism.},

  abstract = {Attaining personalized healthy aging requires accurate monitoring of physiological changes and identifying subclinical markers that predict accelerated or delayed aging. Classic biostatistical methods most rely on supervised variables to estimate physiological aging and do not capture the full complexity of inter-parameter interactions. Machine learning (ML) is promising, but its black box nature eludes direct understanding, substantially limiting physician confidence and clinical usage. Using a broad population dataset from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study including routine biological variables and after selection of XGBoost as the most appropriate algorithm, we created an innovative explainable ML framework to determine a Personalized physiological age (PPA). PPA predicted both chronic disease and mortality independently of chronological age. Twenty-six variables were sufficient to predict PPA. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we implemented a precise quantitative associated metric for each variable explaining physiological (i.e., accelerated or delayed) deviations from age-specific normative data. Among the variables, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) displays a major relative weight in the estimation of PPA. Finally, clustering profiles of identical contextualized explanations reveal different aging trajectories opening opportunities to specific clinical follow-up. These data show that PPA is a robust, quantitative and explainable ML-based metric that monitors personalized health status. Our approach also provides a complete framework applicable to different datasets or variables, allowing precision physiological age estimation., Personalized physiological age (PPA) is a robust, quantitative and explainable machine learning-based metric that monitors health status.

However, while they boost productivity in some studies, many others show that users are working ineffectively with GenAI systems and losing productivity. Despite the apparent novelty of these usability challenges, these 'ironies of automation' have been observed for over three decades in Human Factors research on the introduction of automation in domains such as aviation, automated driving, and intelligence. We draw on this extensive research alongside recent GenAI user studies to outline four key reasons for productivity loss with GenAI systems: a shift in users' roles from production to evaluation, unhelpful restructuring of workflows, interruptions, and a tendency for automation to make easy tasks easier and hard tasks harder. We then suggest how Human Factors research can also inform GenAI system design to mitigate productivity loss by using approaches such as continuous feedback, system personalization, ecological interface design, task stabilization, and clear task allocation. Thus, we ground developments in GenAI system usability in decades of Human Factors research, ensuring that the design of human-AI interactions in this rapidly moving field learns from history instead of repeating it.},

It's known as generative AI. After the 30 November 2022 release of OpenAI's GPT-3.5, a landmark example of generative AI, this new type of intelligence in machines has taken the world by  storm. Unlike traditional AI known since the 1950s, generative AI doesn't just process  existing data. It learns from it and uses what it has learned to generate new  creations that didn't exist before, including text, images, videos, and code.~ Tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, Google's Bard,  and IBM Watson are swiftly democratizing generative AI for business and private  applications. As this technology develops, experts predict tectonic changes.~ Skills will evolve. Smaller players will gain creative and technical powers once  exclusive to big organizations. Education will become more personalized, and  healthcare breakthroughs should be expected too. As this technology develops, experts predict tectonic changes.~ Skills will evolve.

  abstract = {Two critical policy questions will determine the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the knowledge economy and the creative sector. The first concerns how we think about the training of such models---in particular, whether the creators or owners of the data that are ``scraped'' (lawfully or unlawfully, with or without permission) should be compensated for that use. The second question revolves around the ownership of the output generated by AI, which is continually improving in quality and scale. These topics fall in the realm of intellectual property, a legal framework designed to incentivize and reward only human creativity and innovation. For some years, however, Britain has maintained a distinct category for ``computer-generated'' outputs; on the input issue, the EU and Singapore have recently introduced exceptions allowing for text and data mining or computational data analysis of existing works. This article explores the broader implications of these policy choices, weighing the advantages of reducing the cost of content creation and the value of expertise against the potential risk to various careers and sectors of the economy, which might be rendered unsustainable. Lessons may be found in the music industry, which also went through a period of unrestrained piracy in the early digital era, epitomized by the rise and fall of the file-sharing service Napster. Similar litigation and legislation may help navigate the present uncertainty, along with an emerging market for ``legitimate'' models that respect the copyright of humans and are clear about the provenance of their own creations.},

Diverging from the usual emphasis on performance metrics, we focus on the impact of this training methodology on linguistic diversity, especially when conducted recursively over time. To assess this, we developed a set of novel metrics targeting lexical, syntactic, and semantic diversity, applying them in recursive fine-tuning experiments across various natural language generation tasks. Our findings reveal a marked decrease in the diversity of the models' outputs through successive iterations. This trend underscores the potential risks of training LLMs on predecessor-generated text, particularly concerning the preservation of linguistic richness. Our study highlights the need for careful consideration of the long-term effects of such training approaches on the linguistic capabilities of LLMs.},

Not limited to the research community, ordinary Internet users enjoy these generative models, and consequently, a tremendous amount of generated images have been shared on the Internet. Meanwhile, today's success of deep learning in the computer vision field owes a lot to images collected from the Internet. These trends lead us to a research question: "{\textbackslash}textbf\{will such generated images impact the quality of future datasets and the performance of computer vision models positively or negatively?\}" This paper empirically answers this question by simulating contamination. Namely, we generate ImageNet-scale and COCO-scale datasets using a state-of-the-art generative model and evaluate models trained with "contaminated" datasets on various tasks, including image classification and image generation. Throughout experiments, we conclude that generated images negatively affect downstream performance, while the significance depends on tasks and the amount of generated images. The generated datasets and the codes for experiments will be publicly released for future research.

TwinGraph is the model orchestration module within the open-source TwinFlow framework that enables deploying predictive modeling, simulation, and Level 4 Digital Twin workflows at scale.

Generative AI techniques are powered by large machine learning models, pre-trained on very large amounts of data.

However, despite the success of foundation models in modalities such as natural language processing and computer vision, the development of foundation models for time series forecasting has lagged behind. We present Lag-Llama, a general-purpose foundation model for univariate probabilistic time series forecasting based on a decoder-only transformer architecture that uses lags as covariates. Lag-Llama is pretrained on a large corpus of diverse time series data from several domains, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization capabilities compared to a wide range of forecasting models on downstream datasets across domains. Moreover, when fine-tuned on relatively small fractions of such previously unseen datasets, Lag-Llama achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior deep learning approaches, emerging as the best general-purpose model on average. Lag-Llama serves as a strong contender to the current state-of-art in time series forecasting and paves the way for future advancements in foundation models tailored to time series data.},

Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at The Transformer -- a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud's recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU offering. So let's try to break the model apart and look at how it functions. The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package. Harvard's NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation. In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter. 2020 Update: I've created a ``Narrated Transformer'' video which is a gentler approach to the topic: A High-Level Look Let's begin by looking at the model as a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another.},

  abstract = {Since the advent of personal computing devices, intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) have been one of the key technologies that researchers and engineers have focused on, aiming to help users efficiently obtain information and execute tasks, and provide users with more intelligent, convenient, and rich interaction experiences. With the development of smartphones and IoT, computing and sensing devices have become ubiquitous, greatly expanding the boundaries of IPAs. However, due to the lack of capabilities such as user intent understanding, task planning, tool using, and personal data management etc., existing IPAs still have limited practicality and scalability. Recently, the emergence of foundation models, represented by large language models (LLMs), brings new opportunities for the development of IPAs. With the powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLM can enable intelligent agents to solve complex problems autonomously. In this paper, we focus on Personal LLM Agents, which are LLM-based agents that are deeply integrated with personal data and personal devices and used for personal assistance. We envision that Personal LLM Agents will become a major software paradigm for end-users in the upcoming era. To realize this vision, we take the first step to discuss several important questions about Personal LLM Agents, including their architecture, capability, efficiency and security. We start by summarizing the key components and design choices in the architecture of Personal LLM Agents, followed by an in-depth analysis of the opinions collected from domain experts. Next, we discuss several key challenges to achieve intelligent, efficient and secure Personal LLM Agents, followed by a comprehensive survey of representative solutions to address these challenges.},

In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to prompt optimization where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8\% on GSM8K, and by up to 50\% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

  abstract = {The ML community is rapidly exploring techniques for prompting language models (LMs) and for stacking them into pipelines that solve complex tasks. Unfortunately, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded "prompt templates", i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward a more systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines, we introduce DSPy, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text transformation graphs, i.e. imperative computational graphs where LMs are invoked through declarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized, meaning they can learn (by creating and collecting demonstrations) how to apply compositions of prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques. We design a compiler that will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given metric. We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can express and optimize sophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word problems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control agent loops. Within minutes of compiling, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 and llama2-13b-chat to self-bootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot prompting (generally by over 25\% and 65\%, respectively) and pipelines with expert-created demonstrations (by up to 5-46\% and 16-40\%, respectively). On top of that, DSPy programs compiled to open and relatively small LMs like 770M-parameter T5 and llama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely on expert-written prompt chains for proprietary GPT-3.5. DSPy is available at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy},

Using this web app we build Pick-a-Pic, a large, open dataset of text-to-image prompts and real users' preferences over generated images.

Then, we test PickScore's ability to perform model evaluation and observe that it correlates better with human rankings than other automatic evaluation metrics. Therefore, we recommend using PickScore for evaluating future text-to-image generation models, and using Pick-a-Pic prompts as a more relevant dataset than MS-COCO.

We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of "positive thinking" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best "positive thinking" prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.},

  abstract = {The increased uptake of variable renewable energy sources has increased electricity price volatility in many energy pool markets, providing an opportunity for storage systems to profit through energy arbitrage. Comparison between the cost or value of storage systems engaging in energy arbitrage should be performed on a levelised basis due to differences in system lifetime. Existing energy arbitrage models with bid/offer curves and imperfect forecasting are typically computationally expensive and are impractical for calculating lifetime levelised cost metrics. In this work, an open-source modular energy arbitrage model with bid and offer curve inputs was developed for a lithium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS) and pumped hydro system (PHS) to analyse lifetime levelised cost and revenue. The mixed integer linear program scheduling module included a new piece-wise linearised description of PHS charging behaviour for rapid optimisation. A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis indicated that levelised cost and revenue were highly sensitive to discharging efficiency. In a case study based on Australia's National Electricity Market, imperfect forecasting with no risk hedging was found to increase levelised costs by up to 24\% and decrease levelised revenue by up to 50\% relative to perfect price forecasting, despite 95\% of prices being forecast to be within \$35/MWh of the actual trading price. BESS levelised costs were more significantly correlated with consistent low risk bids (Kendall Tau-b of 0.75), since the undiscounted capital costs contribute to a larger proportion of the overall costs than in the PHS systems.},

First, on the ``vertical'' dimension, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models are stacked up to produce supplementary price forecasts. The final forecasts are then picked depending on how the predictions compare to a price spike threshold. On the ``horizontal'' dimension, five models are designed to extend the forecasting horizon to four days. This is an important requirement to make forecasts useful for market participants who trade energy and ancillary services multiple days ahead. The horizontally cascaded models take advantage of the availability of specific public data for each forecasting horizon. To enhance the forecasting capability of the model in dealing with price spikes, we deploy a previously unexplored input in the proposed methodology. That is, to use the recent variations in the output power of thermal units as an indicator of unplanned outages or shift in the supply stack. The proposed method is tested using data from Alberta's electricity market, which is known for its volatility and price spikes. An economic application of the developed forecasting model is also carried out to demonstrate how several market players in the Alberta electricity market can benefit from the proposed multi-day ahead price forecasting model. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is effective in enhancing forecasting accuracy and price spike detection.},

We introduce a novel approach to normalize time series data conditional on a set of covariates. We do this by modeling the conditional mean and the conditional variance of the time series with generalized additive models using a set of covariates. The conditional mean and variance are then used to normalize the time series. We illustrate the use of conditionally normalized series using two applications involving river network data. First, we show how these normalized time series can be used to impute missing values in the data. Second, we show how the normalized series can be used to estimate the conditional autocorrelation function and conditional cross-correlation functions via additive models. Finally we use the conditional cross-correlations to estimate the time it takes water to flow between two locations in a river network.},

Over the last decade, much of the research done at Google has been in pursuit of a similar vision --- to help people better understand the world around them and get things done. We want to build more capable machines that partner with people to accomplish a huge variety of tasks. All kinds of tasks. Complex, information-seeking tasks. Creative tasks, like creating music, drawing new pictures, or creating videos. Analysis and synthesis tasks, like crafting new documents or emails from a few sentences of guidance, or partnering with people to jointly write software together. We want to solve complex mathematical or scientific problems. Transform modalities, or translate the world's information into any language. Diagnose complex diseases, or understand the physical world. Accomplish complex, multi-step actions in both the virtual software world and the physical world of robotics. We've demonstrated early versions of some of these capabilities in research artifacts, and we've partnered with many teams across Google to ship some of these capabilities in Google products that touch the lives of billions of users. But the most exciting aspects of this journey still lie ahead! With this post, I am kicking off a series in which researchers across Google will highlight some exciting progress we've made in 2022 and present our vision for 2023 and beyond. I will begin with a discussion of language, computer vision, multi-modal models, and generative machine learning models.

Foundation models have transformed artificial intelligence (AI), powering prominent generative AI applications like ChatGPT. The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence's (HAI) Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) created and popularized the term.Foundation models are general-purpose technologies that can support a diverse range of use cases. Building foundation models is often highly resource-intensive, with the most expensive models costing hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for the underlying data and compute required. In contrast, adapting an existing foundation model for a specific use case or using it directly is much less expensive.  Early examples of foundation models were language models (LMs) like Google's BERT and OpenAI's "GPT-n" series. Beyond text, foundation models have been developed across a range of modalities---including DALL-E and Flamingo for images, MusicGen for music, and RT-2 for robotic control. Foundation models constitute a broad shift in AI development: foundation models are being built for astronomy, radiology, genomics, music, coding, and mathematics.},

More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective.

However, a rapidly growing interest lies in leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to brainstorm new product and service ideas. This study conducts a comparative analysis of ideas generated by human professionals and an AI system. The results of a blind expert evaluation show that AI-generated ideas score significantly higher in novelty and customer benefit, while their feasibility scores are similar to those of human ideas. Overall, AI-generated ideas comprise the majority of the top-performing ideas, while human-generated ideas scored lower than expected. The executive's emotional and cognitive reactions were measured during the evaluation to check for potential biases and showed no differences between the idea groups. These findings suggest that, under certain circumstances, companies can benefit from integrating generative AI into their traditional idea-generation processes.},

Following the release, managerial discussions of GAI in conference calls increase substantially, and the increase is more pronounced for firms with greater innovation intensity, cybersecurity threats, product differentiation, labor exposure to AI, and customer operations, suggesting that these firms are more likely to be affected by GAI. Managers tend to believe that GAI is more beneficial to firms with greater innovation intensity and cybersecurity threats but is more detrimental to firms with greater product differentiation. While they hold mixed views on GAI's impact on firms with greater labor exposure to AI and customer operations, their views are more likely to be positive than negative. Managers of firms with greater innovation intensity, cybersecurity threats and customer operations (product differentiation) increase initiative-related (non-initiative-related) discussions more. While managers of firms with greater labor exposure to AI increase discussions of both types more, they are more likely to increase initiative-related discussions.

Following multi-method qualitative research, we performed a literature review, conducted workshops, and interviewed IT support agents, managers, and AI experts. Thereby, we examine AI augmentation for frontline service employees in the context of IT support to carve out where and how GenAI can be leveraged to develop more efficient and higher-quality customer support.

In a preregistered online experiment, we assigned occupation-specific, incentivized writing tasks to 453 college-educated professionals and randomly exposed half of them to ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40\% and output quality rose by 18\%. Inequality between workers decreased, and concern and excitement about AI temporarily rose. Workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were 2 times as likely to report using it in their real job 2 weeks after the experiment and 1.6 times as likely 2 months after the experiment.           ,              Editor's summary             Automation has historically displaced human workers in factories (e.g., automotive manufacturing) or in performing routine computational tasks. Will generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT disrupt the labor market by making educated professionals obsolete, or will these tools complement their skills and enhance productivity? Noy and Zhang examined this issue in an experiment that recruited college-educated professionals to complete incentivized writing tasks. Participants assigned to use ChatGPT were more productive, efficient, and enjoyed the tasks more. Participants with weaker skills benefited the most from ChatGPT, which carries policy implications for efforts to reduce productivity inequality through AI. ---EEU           ,              The assistive chatbot ChatGPT raises productivity in professional writing tasks and reduces productivity inequality.},

  abstract = {Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models. Code, model weights, and data will be released.},

  abstract = {Using AI/ML in Improving Industrial Reliability through PM Predictive Maintenance (PM) is becoming ubiquitous for improving availability and reliability along with reducing O\&M costs in industrial systems. Despite significant research and development investment in the last decade most deployed solutions still tend to be piecemeal (component or failure mode specific) point solutions and generally lack trust with respect to automated decision making. Full end-to-end deployment with system-wide coverage and autonomy still remains an elusive goal in industrial setting. This is primarily due to high cost and limited scalability of conventional modeling approaches for underlying complex systems and processes in large fleets. Specifically, capabilities to safe-guard against unknown-unknowns, lack of explain-ability and trust tend to be key bottlenecks. Given these systems are heavily instrumented generating large volumes of high-speed data and compute costs continue to go down, recent advancements in data-driven methods using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promise in a number of areas that previously led to valley of death between PM technology and commercialization. GE's Digital Twin technology for Predictive Maintenance is leveraging AI to bridge a number of such critical gaps that were otherwise very challenging to tackle through conventional methods. This session will enumerate key challenges in enabling system-wide predictive maintenance and how AI is being used to overcome these. Specifically, a causal deep learning-based approach will be described that provides a causal graph of inter-variable relationships allowing validation of deep learning model with domain experts. Further, by providing causal factors for identified anomalies root cause analysis can be facilitated for alert disposition in efficient manner at the fleet level. We will also describe our approach towards competency awareness of AI models, which aims to solve uncertainty management and trust for industrial applications of AI. Various applications and use-cases will be shared to show effectiveness of AI and ML using both structured and unstructured data in the context of intelligent PM. Speaker: Dr. Abhinav Saxena is a Principal Scientist in AI \& Learning Systems at GE Research. Abhinav has been developing ML/AI-based PHM solutions for various industrial systems (aviation, nuclear, power, and healthcare) at GE and has been driving integration of AI-based PHM analytics in GE's industrial systems. He is the PI for ARPA-E GEMINA program on AI-Enabled Predictive Maintenance Digital twins for Advanced Nuclear Reactors.},

Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. We pretrained Chronos models based on the T5 family (ranging from 20M to 710M parameters) on a large collection of publicly available datasets, complemented by a synthetic dataset that we generated via Gaussian processes to improve generalization. In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them. Our results demonstrate that Chronos models can leverage time series data from diverse domains to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks, positioning pretrained models as a viable tool to greatly simplify forecasting pipelines.},

Some qood quotes

\begin{quotation}

\par
One solution to this problem is~to deploy AI to the public in the form of more specialized applications about which~\_most\_~people basically agree ---~to ``scope'' it, in other words. A good customer-service chatbot is polite, perhaps a bit stubborn, and refuses to talk about anything but the matter at hand.~It's clear when they're doing something they're not supposed to do:
\par
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}

\par
This is how most large-language-model--based products are actually being developed and used in 2024: by start-ups with a specific task and type of customer in mind; by companies like Google and Microsoft in the form of purpose-built products (meeting transcribers, translation tools, coding assistants, image generators used instead of background stock images); in the form of better-defined personae, as in the case of OpenAI's tailor-made GPTs, through which users can basically assign characters themselves. Specialized AI represents real products and an aggregate situation in which questions about AI bias, training data, and ideology at least feel less salient to customers and users. The ``characters'' performed by scoped, purpose-built AI are performing joblike roles with employeelike personae. They don't need to have an opinion on Hitler or Elon Musk because the customers aren't looking for one, and the bosses won't let it have one, and that makes perfect sense to everyone in the contexts in which they're being deployed. They're expected to be careful about what they say and to avoid subjects that aren't germane to the task for which they've been ``hired.''
\par
In contrast, general-purpose public chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini are practically begging to be asked about Hitler

  abstract = {Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5\${\textbackslash}times\$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.},

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.},

  abstract = {The landscape of software development has witnessed a paradigm shift with the advent of AI-powered assistants, exemplified by GitHub Copilot. However, existing solutions are not leveraging all the potential capabilities available in an IDE such as building, testing, executing code, git operations, etc. Therefore, they are constrained by their limited capabilities, primarily focusing on suggesting code snippets and file manipulation within a chat-based interface. To fill this gap, we present AutoDev, a fully automated AI-driven software development framework, designed for autonomous planning and execution of intricate software engineering tasks. AutoDev enables users to define complex software engineering objectives, which are assigned to AutoDev's autonomous AI Agents to achieve. These AI agents can perform diverse operations on a codebase, including file editing, retrieval, build processes, execution, testing, and git operations. They also have access to files, compiler output, build and testing logs, static analysis tools, and more. This enables the AI Agents to execute tasks in a fully automated manner with a comprehensive understanding of the contextual information required. Furthermore, AutoDev establishes a secure development environment by confining all operations within Docker containers. This framework incorporates guardrails to ensure user privacy and file security, allowing users to define specific permitted or restricted commands and operations within AutoDev. In our evaluation, we tested AutoDev on the HumanEval dataset, obtaining promising results with 91.5\% and 87.8\% of Pass@1 for code generation and test generation respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in automating software engineering tasks while maintaining a secure and user-controlled development environment.},

Linear relation representations may be obtained by constructing a first-order approximation to the LM from a single prompt, and they exist for a variety of factual, commonsense, and linguistic relations. However, we also identify many cases in which LM predictions capture relational knowledge accurately, but this knowledge is not linearly encoded in their representations.

\begin{itemize}

\item has never seen ``crimson'' in some kind of sentence
\item has seen enough to know that crimson and red are used in similar contexts
\item could eventually say something is crimson

\end{itemize}

\item that's a kind of invention, or ``creativity''. ~ Can actually make that sentence more interesting, novel
\item 
\par
but gen AI doesn't know the difference between that and ``true''

"It generalizes or makes an inference based on what it knows about language,
\par
what it knows about the occurrence of words in di erent contexts," said
\par
Swabha Swayamdipta, assistant professor of computer science at the USC
\par
Viterbi School of Engineering and leader of the Data, Interpretability,
\par
Language and Learning(DILL) lab. "This is why these language models produce
\par
facts which kind of seem plausible but are not quite true because they're not
\par
trained to just produce exactly what they have seen before."

\par
\item can also be result of improper and/or biased training data

\end{itemize}

\par
\item 
\par
"It's just saying, 'Based on this word, I think that the right probability is this next word.' That's what it is.

Through instruction-tuning a large language model (LLM) with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, it showed that a model could answer human questions and follow instructions on a broad panel of tasks. Following this success, interests in LLMs have intensified, with new LLMs flourishing at frequent interval across academia and industry, including many start-ups focused on LLMs. While closed-source LLMs (e.g., OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude) generally outperform their open-source counterparts, the progress on the latter has been rapid with claims of achieving parity or even better on certain tasks. This has crucial implications not only on research but also on business. In this work, on the first anniversary of ChatGPT, we provide an exhaustive overview of this success, surveying all tasks where an open-source LLM has claimed to be on par or better than ChatGPT.},

In most LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks coding contests evaluated in this study, GPT-4 employing the optimal prompt strategy outperforms 85 percent of human participants. Additionally, GPT-4 demonstrates strong capabilities in translating code between different programming languages and in learning from past errors. The computational efficiency of the code generated by GPT-4 is comparable to that of human programmers. These results suggest that GPT-4 has the potential to serve as a reliable assistant in programming code generation and software development.},

They are currently able to achieve high effectiveness in different natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation, named entity recognition, text classification, question answering, or text summarization. Recently, significant attention has been drawn to OpenAI's GPT models' capabilities and extremely accessible interface. LLMs are nowadays routinely used and studied for downstream tasks and specific applications with great success, pushing forward the state of the art in almost all of them. However, they also exhibit impressive inference capabilities when used off the shelf without further training. In this paper, we aim to study the behavior of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in some inference tasks they were not initially trained for. Therefore, we focus our attention on very recent research works related to the inference capabilities of PLMs in some selected tasks such as factual probing and common-sense reasoning. We highlight relevant achievements made by these models, as well as some of their current limitations that open opportunities for further research.

To address this gap, we introduce the Quantitative Reasoning with Data (QRData) benchmark, aiming to evaluate Large Language Models' capability in statistical and causal reasoning with real-world data. The benchmark comprises a carefully constructed dataset of 411 questions accompanied by data sheets from textbooks, online learning materials, and academic papers. To compare models' quantitative reasoning abilities on data and text, we enrich the benchmark with an auxiliary set of 290 text-only questions, namely QRText. We evaluate natural language reasoning, program-based reasoning, and agent reasoning methods including Chain-of-Thought, Program-of-Thoughts, ReAct, and code interpreter assistants on diverse models. The strongest model GPT-4 achieves an accuracy of 58\%, which has a large room for improvement. Among open-source models, Deepseek-coder-instruct, a code LLM pretrained on 2T tokens, gets the highest accuracy of 37\%. Analysis reveals that models encounter difficulties in data analysis and causal reasoning, and struggle in using causal knowledge and provided data simultaneously.

  abstract = {Electrical energy storage resources (ESRs) o er a promising solution to many of the issues facing the electric grid. In order for this promise to be fully realized,new intelligent decision-making technologies are required. This dissertation studies the operation and valuation of ESRs in an uncertain electric grid environment.ESRs can include both stationary battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and distributed deferrable loads such as plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). An ESR can be operated to provide multiple services simultaneously, maximizingits value. An EV can provide transportation services as well as participate in electric grid frequency regulation. A BESS can also provide frequency regulation while providing load peak shifting. In this thesis, we propose new andinnovative solutions that enable optimal operation and accurate valuation of multi-function ESRs under uncertainty. New Markov decision problems (MDPs) for smart charging of EVs are developed for cases of price, ancillary services, anddriver behavior uncertainty. In order to compare the proposed MDP approaches with deterministic optimization approaches, a Dynamic Monitoring and DecisionSystems (DYMONDS) energy market simulation is developed. We also propose an in nite horizon MDP approach to estimating the net present value of a BESSthat degrades over time. In order to optimize the economic scheduling of an ESR that provides frequency regulation service, one needs a predictive model of theautomatic generation control (AGC) signal. We investigate timeseries and other statistical models for the prediction of an AGC signal and its cumulative eff ect on the state of charge of an ESR.},

Two common challenges afflicting the task are the volatility of the predictions and their computational complexity. We introduce N-HiTS, a model which addresses both challenges by incorporating novel hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate data sampling techniques. These techniques enable the proposed method to assemble its predictions sequentially, emphasizing components with different frequencies and scales while decomposing the input signal and synthesizing the forecast. We prove that the hierarchical interpolation technique can efficiently approximate arbitrarily long horizons in the presence of smoothness. Additionally, we conduct extensive large-scale dataset experiments from the long-horizon forecasting literature, demonstrating the advantages of our method over the state-of-the-art methods, where N-HiTS provides an average accuracy improvement of almost 20\% over the latest Transformer architectures while reducing the computation time by an order of magnitude (50 times).

It is unclear whether state-of-the-art embeddings on semantic textual similarity (STS) can be equally well applied to other tasks like clustering or reranking. This makes progress in the field difficult to track, as various models are constantly being proposed without proper evaluation. To solve this problem, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). MTEB spans 8 embedding tasks covering a total of 58 datasets and 112 languages. Through the benchmarking of 33 models on MTEB, we establish the most comprehensive benchmark of text embeddings to date. We find that no particular text embedding method dominates across all tasks. This suggests that the field has yet to converge on a universal text embedding method and scale it up sufficiently to provide state-of-the-art results on all embedding tasks. MTEB comes with open-source code and a public leaderboard at https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb.},

The availability of large language models (LLMs) has also changed how developers build AI-powered applications and has led to the emergence of various new developer tools. Although vector databases have been around long before ChatGPT, they have become an integral part of the GenAI technology stack, as vector databases can address some of LLMs' key limitations, such as hallucinations and lack of long-term memory This article first introduces vector databases and their use cases. Next, you will learn more about how vector databases are designed to help developers get started with building GenAI applications quickly. As a developer advocate at Weaviate, an open-source vector database, I will use Weaviate to demonstrate relevant concepts as we go along. In the final discussion, you will learn how they can address the challenges enterprises face when moving these prototypes to production.},

These data descriptions are captured as numerical vectors that are computationally inexpensive to store and compare. However, the unique characteristics of vectorized data, including high dimensionality and sparsity, demand specialized solutions for efficient storage, retrieval, and processing. This narrative literature review provides an accessible introduction to the fundamental concepts, use-cases, and current challenges associated with vector database management systems, offering an overview for researchers and practitioners seeking to facilitate effective vector data management.},

Fun website showing how OpenAI tokenizes. Shows how the words are split, how words w/ same spelling get different tokens (bear and bear, verb/noun, so POS parsing), prefixes and punctuation gets coded (codes are displayed, so I could try to look them up, and make a slide showing the difference.

For example:
\par
\begin{quotation}

\par
``She wanted to read `I can't' as a single word, but the tokenizer insisted on splitting it into three tokens: `I,' `can,' and `t'.'' 
\par
\end{quotation}

\par
See that GPT4, GPT3.5 has fewer tokens (37) than GPT3 (54) for this sentence:
\par
Here's another:
\par
\begin{quotation}

\par
"While hiking, we spotted a large brown bear lumbering through the trees. We had to bear right at the next fork to avoid its path."
\par
\end{quotation}

\par
There, bear and bear get different tokens. ~Interesting how ``While is grouped.
\par

We show that style vectors can be simply computed from recorded layer activations for input texts in a specific style in contrast to more complex training-based approaches. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of activation engineering using such style vectors to influence the style of generated text in a nuanced and parameterisable way, distinguishing it from prompt engineering. The presented research constitutes a significant step towards developing more adaptive and effective AI-empowered interactive systems.},

Tokenizers are a completely separate stage of the LLM pipeline: they have their own training sets, training algorithms (Byte Pair Encoding), and after training implement two fundamental functions: encode() from strings to tokens, and decode() back from tokens to strings. In this lecture we build from scratch the Tokenizer used in the GPT series from OpenAI. In the process, we will see that a lot of weird behaviors and problems of LLMs actually trace back to tokenization.

Our maximum likelihood model leverages expert-written and AI-generated reference texts to accurately and efficiently examine real-world LLM-use at the corpus level. We apply this approach to a case study of scientific peer review in AI conferences that took place after the release of ChatGPT: ICLR 2024, NeurIPS 2023, CoRL 2023 and EMNLP 2023. Our results suggest that between 6.5\% and 16.9\% of text submitted as peer reviews to these conferences could have been substantially modified by LLMs, i.e. beyond spell-checking or minor writing updates. The circumstances in which generated text occurs offer insight into user behavior: the estimated fraction of LLM-generated text is higher in reviews which report lower confidence, were submitted close to the deadline, and from reviewers who are less likely to respond to author rebuttals. We also observe corpus-level trends in generated text which may be too subtle to detect at the individual level, and discuss the implications of such trends on peer review. We call for future interdisciplinary work to examine how LLM use is changing our information and knowledge practices.},

  abstract = {In this report, we present the latest model of the Gemini family, Gemini 1.5 Pro, a highly compute-efficient multimodal mixture-of-experts model capable of recalling and reasoning over fine-grained information from millions of tokens of context, including multiple long documents and hours of video and audio. Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improves the state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA and long-context ASR, and matches or surpasses Gemini 1.0 Ultra's state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5 Pro's long-context ability, we find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval ({$>$}99\%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 2.1 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, we highlight surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content.},

We ensure that the questions are high-quality and extremely difficult: experts who have or are pursuing PhDs in the corresponding domains reach 65\% accuracy (74\% when discounting clear mistakes the experts identified in retrospect), while highly skilled non-expert validators only reach 34\% accuracy, despite spending on average over 30 minutes with unrestricted access to the web (i.e., the questions are "Google-proof"). The questions are also difficult for state-of-the-art AI systems, with our strongest GPT-4 based baseline achieving 39\% accuracy. If we are to use future AI systems to help us answer very hard questions, for example, when developing new scientific knowledge, we need to develop scalable oversight methods that enable humans to supervise their outputs, which may be difficult even if the supervisors are themselves skilled and knowledgeable. The difficulty of GPQA both for skilled non-experts and frontier AI systems should enable realistic scalable oversight experiments, which we hope can help devise ways for human experts to reliably get truthful information from AI systems that surpass human capabilities.},

However, as new and improved LLMs are developed, existing evaluation benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP) are no longer sufficient for assessing their capabilities. In this work, we propose LiveCodeBench, a comprehensive and contamination-free evaluation of LLMs for code, which continuously collects new problems over time from contests across three competition platforms, namely LeetCode, AtCoder, and CodeForces. Notably, our benchmark also focuses on a broader range of code related capabilities, such as self-repair, code execution, and test output prediction, beyond just code generation. Currently, LiveCodeBench hosts four hundred high-quality coding problems that were published between May 2023 and February 2024. We have evaluated 9 base LLMs and 20 instruction-tuned LLMs on LiveCodeBench. We present empirical findings on contamination, holistic performance comparisons, potential overfitting in existing benchmarks as well as individual model comparisons. We will release all prompts and model completions for further community analysis, along with a general toolkit for adding new scenarios and model},

We review recent post-training enhancements, categorizing them into five types: tool-use, prompting methods, scaffolding, solution selection, and data generation. Different enhancements improve performance on different tasks, making it hard to compare their significance. So we translate improvements from different enhancements into a common currency, the compute-equivalent gain: how much additional training compute would be needed to improve performance by the same amount as the enhancement. Our non-experimental work shows that post-training enhancements have significant benefits: most surveyed enhancements improve benchmark performance by more than a 5x increase in training compute, some by more than 20x. Post-training enhancements are relatively cheap to develop: fine-tuning costs are typically {$<$}1\% of the original training cost. Governing the development of capable post-training enhancements may be challenging because frontier models could be enhanced by a wide range of actors.},
  archiveprefix = {arXiv},

Fine-Tuning typically take {$<$} 1\% of original training cost, and the resulting performance gains are far cheaper than what it would have taken to invest in more compute in the original training run: 5-10X better for the same investment.

Conclusion is that non-state actors with small budgets will be able to generate very sophisticated algorithms (Didn't the EU AI Act (Yamimova and Ojamo, 2024), limit compute power somehow to prevent AI terrorism? ~I read/heard this on a video or article somewhere but didin't follow up on it.

In this paper, we take analyses usually applied at the industrial level and make them accessible for individual computer science researchers with an easy-to-use Python package. Localizing to the energy mixture of the electrical power grid, we make the conversion from energy usage to CO2 emissions, in addition to contextualizing these results with more human-understandable benchmarks such as automobile miles driven. We also include comparisons with energy mixtures employed in electrical grids around the world. We propose including these automatically-generated Energy Usage Reports as part of standard algorithmic accountability practices, and demonstrate the use of these reports as part of model-choice in a machine learning context.},

ReFT methods operate on a frozen base model and learn task-specific interventions on hidden representations. We define a strong instance of the ReFT family, Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT). LoReFT is a drop-in replacement for existing PEFTs and learns interventions that are 10x-50x more parameter-efficient than prior state-of-the-art PEFTs. We showcase LoReFT on eight commonsense reasoning tasks, four arithmetic reasoning tasks, Alpaca-Eval v1.0, and GLUE. In all these evaluations, LoReFT delivers the best balance of efficiency and performance, and almost always outperforms state-of-the-art PEFTs.

  abstract = {Transformer-based language models spread FLOPs uniformly across input sequences. In this work we demonstrate that transformers can instead learn to dynamically allocate FLOPs (or compute) to specific positions in a sequence, optimising the allocation along the sequence for different layers across the model depth. Our method enforces a total compute budget by capping the number of tokens (\$k\$) that can participate in the self-attention and MLP computations at a given layer. The tokens to be processed are determined by the network using a top-\$k\$ routing mechanism. Since \$k\$ is defined a priori, this simple procedure uses a static computation graph with known tensor sizes, unlike other conditional computation techniques. Nevertheless, since the identities of the \$k\$ tokens are fluid, this method can expend FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Thus, compute expenditure is entirely predictable in sum total, but dynamic and context-sensitive at the token-level. Not only do models trained in this way learn to dynamically allocate compute, they do so efficiently. These models match baseline performance for equivalent FLOPS and wall-clock times to train, but require a fraction of the FLOPs per forward pass, and can be upwards of 50{\textbackslash}\% faster to step during post-training sampling.},

  abstract = {The recent boom of linear forecasting models questions the ongoing passion for architectural modifications of Transformer-based forecasters. These forecasters leverage Transformers to model the global dependencies over temporal tokens of time series, with each token formed by multiple variates of the same timestamp. However, Transformers are challenged in forecasting series with larger lookback windows due to performance degradation and computation explosion. Besides, the embedding for each temporal token fuses multiple variates that represent potential delayed events and distinct physical measurements, which may fail in learning variate-centric representations and result in meaningless attention maps. In this work, we reflect on the competent duties of Transformer components and repurpose the Transformer architecture without any modification to the basic components. We propose iTransformer that simply applies the attention and feed-forward network on the inverted dimensions. Specifically, the time points of individual series are embedded into variate tokens which are utilized by the attention mechanism to capture multivariate correlations; meanwhile, the feed-forward network is applied for each variate token to learn nonlinear representations. The iTransformer model achieves state-of-the-art on challenging real-world datasets, which further empowers the Transformer family with promoted performance, generalization ability across different variates, and better utilization of arbitrary lookback windows, making it a nice alternative as the fundamental backbone of time series forecasting.

However, evaluating LLMs on realistic text generation tasks for healthcare remains challenging. Existing question answering datasets for electronic health record (EHR) data fail to capture the complexity of information needs and documentation burdens experienced by clinicians. To address these challenges, we introduce MedAlign, a benchmark dataset of 983 natural language instructions for EHR data. MedAlign is curated by 15 clinicians (7 specialities), includes clinician-written reference responses for 303 instructions, and provides 276 longitudinal EHRs for grounding instruction-response pairs. We used MedAlign to evaluate 6 general domain LLMs, having clinicians rank the accuracy and quality of each LLM response. We found high error rates, ranging from 35\% (GPT-4) to 68\% (MPT-7B-Instruct), and an 8.3\% drop in accuracy moving from 32k to 2k context lengths for GPT-4. Finally, we report correlations between clinician rankings and automated natural language generation metrics as a way to rank LLMs without human review. We make MedAlign available under a research data use agreement to enable LLM evaluations on tasks aligned with clinician needs and preferences.},

CoDoC enhances accuracy relative to clinician-only or AI-only baselines in clinical workflows that screen for breast cancer or tuberculosis (TB).

For TB triaging, compared to standalone AI and clinical workflows, CoDoC achieved a 5--15\% reduction in false positives at the same false-negative rate for three of five commercially available predictive AI systems. To facilitate the deployment of CoDoC in novel futuristic clinical settings, we present results showing that CoDoC's performance gains are sustained across several axes of variation (imaging modality, clinical setting and predictive AI system) and discuss the limitations of our evaluation and where further validation would be needed.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT models for machine translation, covering various aspects such as quality of different GPT models in comparison with state-of-the-art research and commercial systems, effect of prompting strategies, robustness towards domain shifts and document-level translation. We experiment with eighteen different translation directions involving high and low resource languages, as well as non English-centric translations, and evaluate the performance of three GPT models: ChatGPT, GPT3.5 (text-davinci-003), and text-davinci-002. Our results show that GPT models achieve very competitive translation quality for high resource languages, while having limited capabilities for low resource languages. We also show that hybrid approaches, which combine GPT models with other translation systems, can further enhance the translation quality. We perform comprehensive analysis and human evaluation to further understand the characteristics of GPT translations. We hope that our paper provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field and helps to better understand the potential and limitations of GPT models for translation.},

A small transformer, trained to do modulo 97 arithmetic at first memorized the training data and then test performance caved. ~But when accidentally allowed to keep training, it eventually found an exact solution to the general problem, brining the test error to zero too. ~And it learned it for the general case, for any M modulo N (I think it says).

In one case, it had learned to do modulor arithmetic with a Fourier transform, and another time, it learned a ``pizza slice`` algorithm, that involved bisecting angles -- both methods apppropriate for a brain that only does linear algebra.

But researchers could only figure out the discovered algorithm 40\% (I think it was) of the time; the rest remain a mystery.
\par
A general understanding of the method seems to be that, under regualation, the initial training uses all its resources to memorize the training data, outcompeting the other goal of the alogorithm (somehow) to find a general solution. ~Once it's done memoriztion, the generalization part of the net win out, and get adjusted.

This works even when given noisy incorrect data. ~At first, it memorizes the noisy points and then it unmemorizes that and coverges on the correct generalization, ignoring the noisy points.

Recent advancements in Foundation Models (FMs) have fundamentally reshaped the paradigm of model design for time series analysis, boosting various downstream tasks in practice. These innovative approaches often leverage pre-trained or fine-tuned FMs to harness generalized knowledge tailored specifically for time series analysis. In this survey, we aim to furnish a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of FMs for time series analysis. While prior surveys have predominantly focused on either the application or the pipeline aspects of FMs in time series analysis, they have often lacked an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms that elucidate why and how FMs benefit time series analysis. To address this gap, our survey adopts a model-centric classification, delineating various pivotal elements of time-series FMs, including model architectures, pre-training techniques, adaptation methods, and data modalities. Overall, this survey serves to consolidate the latest advancements in FMs pertinent to time series analysis, accentuating their theoretical underpinnings, recent strides in development, and avenues for future research exploration.},

The Mixtral8x7B ia a mixture of experts LLM that has far fewer params and faster decode time than other dense models, with comparable performance and that you can run on your desktop -- if you have a ridiculous about of VRAM, and probably a GPU. ~(they don't actually compare w/ GPT-4, only GPT3.5turbo).
\par
This efficiency means that, with a fixed computational budget, you can train a complex model for more iterations and/or using more data. ~The smallest (4bit) variant needs 23 GB ``VRAM'' (video RAM). It seems possible to run on a CPU, but this guy sets it up on a beefy GPU.
\par
The idea of Mixture of Experts transformers is explained a bit. ~The idea is, in a transformer, to replace each MLP forward layer block in a transformer with committee of smaller MLPs which specialize in converting categories of tokens. ~Only two run for each token (according to this explanation) and the results are averaged. Diagram shows for MLPs in the block.

\par
The most compute-efficient training strategy is to:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item train huge models and stop after a small number of iterations.
\item then, since large models are more robust to compression that small ones, compress this big one
\item ``compression,'' includes quantization and pruning.

  abstract = {Cosine-similarity is the cosine of the angle between two vectors, or equivalently the dot product between their normalizations. A popular application is to quantify semantic similarity between high-dimensional objects by applying cosine-similarity to a learned low-dimensional feature embedding. This can work better but sometimes also worse than the unnormalized dot-product between embedded vectors in practice. To gain insight into this empirical observation, we study embeddings derived from regularized linear models, where closed-form solutions facilitate analytical insights. We derive analytically how cosine-similarity can yield arbitrary and therefore meaningless `similarities.' For some linear models the similarities are not even unique, while for others they are implicitly controlled by the regularization. We discuss implications beyond linear models: a combination of different regularizations are employed when learning deep models; these have implicit and unintended effects when taking cosine-similarities of the resulting embeddings, rendering results opaque and possibly arbitrary. Based on these insights, we caution against blindly using cosine-similarity and outline alternatives.},

To assess the model performance, a typical approach is to construct evaluation benchmarks for measuring the ability level of LLMs in different aspects. Despite that a number of high-quality benchmarks have been released, the concerns about the appropriate use of these benchmarks and the fair comparison of different models are increasingly growing. Considering these concerns, in this paper, we discuss the potential risk and impact of inappropriately using evaluation benchmarks and misleadingly interpreting the evaluation results. Specially, we focus on a special issue that would lead to inappropriate evaluation, {\textbackslash}ie {\textbackslash}emph\{benchmark leakage\}, referring that the data related to evaluation sets is occasionally used for model training. This phenomenon now becomes more common since pre-training data is often prepared ahead of model test. We conduct extensive experiments to study the effect of benchmark leverage, and find that it can dramatically boost the evaluation results, which would finally lead to an unreliable assessment of model performance. To improve the use of existing evaluation benchmarks, we finally present several guidelines for both LLM developers and benchmark maintainers. We hope this work can draw attention to appropriate training and evaluation of LLMs.},

Our shape representation can encode 3D shapes given as surface models or point clouds, and represents them as neural fields. The concept of neural fields has previously been combined with a global latent vector, a regular grid of latent vectors, or an irregular grid of latent vectors. Our new representation encodes neural fields on top of a set of vectors. We draw from multiple concepts, such as the radial basis function representation and the cross attention and self-attention function, to design a learnable representation that is especially suitable for processing with transformers. Our results show improved performance in 3D shape encoding and 3D shape generative modeling tasks. We demonstrate a wide variety of generative applications: unconditioned generation, category-conditioned generation, text-conditioned generation, point-cloud completion, and image-conditioned generation.},

  abstract = {Automated design synthesis has the potential to revolutionize the modern engineering design process and improve access to highly optimized and customized products across countless industries. Successfully adapting generative machine learning to design engineering may enable such automated design synthesis and is a research subject of great importance. We present a review and analysis of deep generative machine learning models in engineering design. Deep generative models (DGMs) typically leverage deep networks to learn from an input dataset and synthesize new designs. Recently, DGMs such as feedforward neural networks (NNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and certain deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks have shown promising results in design applications like structural optimization, materials design, and shape synthesis. The prevalence of DGMs in engineering design has skyrocketed since 2016. Anticipating the continued growth, we conduct a review of recent advances to benefit researchers interested in DGMs for design. We structure our review as an exposition of the algorithms, datasets, representation methods, and applications commonly used in the current literature. In particular, we discuss key works that have introduced new techniques and methods in DGMs, successfully applied DGMs to a design-related domain, or directly supported the development of DGMs through datasets or auxiliary methods. We further identify key challenges and limitations currently seen in DGMs across design fields, such as design creativity, handling constraints and objectives, and modeling both form and functional performance simultaneously. In our discussion, we identify possible solution pathways as key areas on which to target the future work.},

Potentially billions of molecules can produce a smell, so figuring out which ones produce which smells is difficult to catalog or predict. Sensory maps can help us solve this problem. Color vision has the most familiar examples of these maps, from the color wheel we each learn in primary school to more sophisticated variants used to perform color correction in video production. While these maps have existed for centuries, useful maps for smell have been missing, because smell is a harder problem to crack: molecules vary in many more ways than photons do; data collection requires physical proximity between the smeller and smell (we don't have good smell ``cameras'' and smell ``monitors''); and the human eye only has three sensory receptors for color while the human nose has {$>$} 300 for odor. As a result, previous efforts to produce odor maps have failed to gain traction. In 2019, we developed a graph neural network (GNN) model that began to explore thousands of examples of distinct molecules paired with the smell labels that they evoke, e.g., ``beefy'', ``floral'', or ``minty'', to learn the relationship between a molecule's structure and the probability that such a molecule would have each smell label. The embedding space of this model contains a representation of each molecule as a fixed-length vector describing that molecule in terms of its odor, much as the RGB value of a visual stimulus describes its color.},

  abstract = {Perhaps the most widely touted of GPT-4's at-launch, zero-shot capabilities has been its reported 90th-percentile performance on the Uniform Bar Exam. This paper begins by investigating the methodological challenges in documenting and verifying the 90th-percentile claim, presenting four sets of findings that indicate that OpenAI's estimates of GPT-4's UBE percentile are overinflated.First, although GPT-4's UBE score nears the 90th percentile when examining approximate conversions from February administrations of the Illinois Bar Exam, these estimates are heavily skewed towards repeat test-takers who failed the July administration and score significantly lower than the general test-taking population. Second, data from a recent July administration of the same exam suggests GPT-4's overall UBE percentile was below the 69th percentile, and \${\textbackslash}sim\$48th percentile on essays. Third, examining official NCBE data and using several conservative statistical assumptions, GPT-4's performance against first-time test takers is estimated to be \${\textbackslash}sim\$62nd percentile, including \${\textbackslash}sim\$42nd percentile on essays. Fourth, when examining only those who passed the exam (i.e. licensed or license-pending attorneys), GPT-4's performance is estimated to drop to \${\textbackslash}sim\$48th percentile overall, and \${\textbackslash}sim\$15th percentile on essays.In addition to investigating the validity of the percentile claim, the paper also investigates the validity of GPT-4's reported scaled UBE score of 298. The paper successfully replicates the MBE score, but highlights several methodological issues in the grading of the MPT + MEE components of the exam, which call into question the validity of the reported essay score.Finally, the paper investigates the effect of different hyperparameter combinations on GPT-4's MBE performance, finding no significant effect of adjusting temperature settings, and a significant effect of few-shot chain-of-thought prompting over basic zero-shot prompting. Taken together, these findings carry timely insights for the desirability and feasibility of outsourcing legally relevant tasks to AI models, as well as for the importance for AI developers to implement rigorous and transparent capabilities evaluations to help secure safe and trustworthy AI.},

Given various approaches of human value alignment, ranging from Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), to constitutional learning, etc. there is an urgent need to understand the scope and nature of human values injected into these models before their release. There is also a need for model alignment without a costly large scale human annotation effort. We propose UniVaR, a high-dimensional representation of human value distributions in LLMs, orthogonal to model architecture and training data. Trained from the value-relevant output of eight multilingual LLMs and tested on the output from four multilingual LLMs, namely LlaMA2, ChatGPT, JAIS and Yi, we show that UniVaR is a powerful tool to compare the distribution of human values embedded in different LLMs with different langauge sources. Through UniVaR, we explore how different LLMs prioritize various values in different languages and cultures, shedding light on the complex interplay between human values and language modeling.},

However, existing causal abstraction methods have two major limitations: they require a brute-force search over alignments between the high-level model and the low-level one, and they presuppose that variables in the high-level model will align with disjoint sets of neurons in the low-level one. In this paper, we present distributed alignment search (DAS), which overcomes these limitations. In DAS, we find the alignment between high-level and low-level models using gradient descent rather than conducting a brute-force search, and we allow individual neurons to play multiple distinct roles by analyzing representations in non-standard bases-distributed representations. Our experiments show that DAS can discover internal structure that prior approaches miss. Overall, DAS removes previous obstacles to conducting causal abstraction analyses and allows us to find conceptual structure in trained neural nets.},

We develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data, clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and other medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical professionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones between patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows our system to express unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy and bedside manner. Finally, we present the first comprehensive clinician evaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. We recruited over 1100 U.S. licensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end conversational evaluations of our system by posing as patients and rating the system on several measures. We demonstrate Polaris performs on par with human nurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical readiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner. Additionally, we conduct a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support agents, where we demonstrate our LLM agents significantly outperform a much larger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as from its own medium-size class (LLaMA-2 70B).},

In this survey, we provide an overview of the rapidly expanding body of work on diffusion models, categorizing the research into three key areas: efficient sampling, improved likelihood estimation, and handling data with special structures. We also discuss the potential for combining diffusion models with other generative models for enhanced results. We further review the wide-ranging applications of diffusion models in fields spanning from computer vision, natural language processing, temporal data modeling, to interdisciplinary applications in other scientific disciplines. This survey aims to provide a contextualized, in-depth look at the state of diffusion models, identifying the key areas of focus and pointing to potential areas for further exploration.

\begin{itemize}

\item a way of gettng benefits of different models fine-tuned on different skills into a single model (in \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IWPG1M_IoE}{another video}, author said that fine tuning was actually not that easy, but model merging is easy.
\item 
\par
several kinds of merging,
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item mainly based on vector adds of weights, results in same size model
\item but can also concatenate layers to get a bigger model (frankenmodel)

\end{itemize}

\item 
\par
for now, must be different fine-tuned models of the same core model. ~Same number of layers.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item in that \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IWPG1M_IoE}{another video} above, Mark McQuade says that goal is different model types
\item This \href{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1s2eQlolcI1VGgDhqWIANfkfKvcKrMyNr}{notebook} computes the family tree of models, so can figure out which are mergeable, although I didn't understand it immediately, and still don't.

\end{itemize}

\item In several examples, you youself define the weighting between each model, but in that ~\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IWPG1M_IoE}{other video}, somebody say some evolutionary algorithm works now.
\item \href{https://youtu.be/byf-y0P4hMg?t=1139}{overfitting} occurs when merged models are tuned on the same datasets. ~It seems like it might also contain data from the leaderboard test set. ~The author may be mixing overfitting with training set data leakage. ~She references (keisukegoda3804, 2024) which talks about ``overfitting on the validation set,'' so that's probably what this is.
\item Seems like she's not sure that she, in fact, has created some merged models with data leakage.

Given those shortcomings, we outline a framework for developing Materials Science LLMs (MatSci-LLMs) that are grounded in materials science knowledge and hypothesis generation followed by hypothesis testing. The path to attaining performant MatSci-LLMs rests in large part on building high-quality, multi-modal datasets sourced from scientific literature where various information extraction challenges persist. As such, we describe key materials science information extraction challenges which need to be overcome in order to build large-scale, multi-modal datasets that capture valuable materials science knowledge. Finally, we outline a roadmap for applying future MatSci-LLMs for real-world materials discovery via: 1. Automated Knowledge Base Generation; 2. Automated In-Silico Material Design; and 3.

We investigate the extent of these hallucinations using an original suite of legal queries, comparing LLMs' responses to structured legal metadata and examining their consistency. Our work makes four key contributions: (1) We develop a typology of legal hallucinations, providing a conceptual framework for future research in this area. (2) We find that legal hallucinations are alarmingly prevalent, occurring between 69\% of the time with ChatGPT 3.5 and 88\% with Llama 2, when these models are asked specific, verifiable questions about random federal court cases. (3) We illustrate that LLMs often fail to correct a user's incorrect legal assumptions in a contra-factual question setup. (4) We provide evidence that LLMs cannot always predict, or do not always know, when they are producing legal hallucinations. Taken together, these findings caution against the rapid and unsupervised integration of popular LLMs into legal tasks. Even experienced lawyers must remain wary of legal hallucinations, and the risks are highest for those who stand to benefit from LLMs the most -- pro se litigants or those without access to traditional legal resources.},

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B - chat model on human benchmarks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license. Authors: Albert Q.

  abstract = {Control of complex systems involves both system identification and controller design. Deep neural networks have proven to be successful in many identification tasks, however, from model-based control perspective, these networks are difficult to work with because they are typically nonlinear and nonconvex. Therefore many systems are still identified and controlled based on simple linear models despite their poor representation capability. In this paper we bridge the gap between model accuracy and control tractability faced by neural networks, by explicitly constructing networks that are convex with respect to their inputs. We show that these input convex networks can be trained to obtain accurate models of complex physical systems. In particular, we design input convex recurrent neural networks to capture temporal behavior of dynamical systems. Then optimal controllers can be achieved via solving a convex model predictive control problem. Experiment results demonstrate the good potential of the proposed input convex neural network based approach in a variety of control applications. In particular we show that in the MuJoCo locomotion tasks, we could achieve over 10\% higher performance using 5* less time compared with state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning method; and in the building HVAC control example, our method achieved up to 20\% energy reduction compared with classic linear models.},

Prompt engineering is crucial for deploying LLMs but is poorly understood mathematically. We formalize LLM systems as a class of discrete stochastic dynamical systems to explore prompt engineering through the lens of control theory. We investigate the reachable set of output token sequences \${\textbackslash}mathcal R\_y({\textbackslash}mathbf x\_0)\$ for which there exists a control input sequence \${\textbackslash}mathbf u\$ for each \${\textbackslash}mathbf y {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathcal R\_y({\textbackslash}mathbf x\_0)\$ that steers the LLM to output \${\textbackslash}mathbf y\$ from initial state sequence \${\textbackslash}mathbf x\_0\$. We offer analytic analysis on the limitations on the controllability of self-attention in terms of reachable set, where we prove an upper bound on the reachable set of outputs \${\textbackslash}mathcal R\_y({\textbackslash}mathbf x\_0)\$ as a function of the singular values of the parameter matrices. We present complementary empirical analysis on the controllability of a panel of LLMs, including Falcon-7b, Llama-7b, and Falcon-40b. Our results demonstrate a lower bound on the reachable set of outputs \${\textbackslash}mathcal R\_y({\textbackslash}mathbf x\_0)\$ w.r.t. initial state sequences \${\textbackslash}mathbf x\_0\$ sampled from the Wikitext dataset. We find that the correct next Wikitext token following sequence \${\textbackslash}mathbf x\_0\$ is reachable over 97{\textbackslash}\% of the time with prompts of \$k{\textbackslash}leq 10\$ tokens. We also establish that the top 75 most likely next tokens, as estimated by the LLM itself, are reachable at least 85{\textbackslash}\% of the time with prompts of \$k{\textbackslash}leq 10\$ tokens. Intriguingly, short prompt sequences can dramatically alter the likelihood of specific outputs, even making the least likely tokens become the most likely ones. This control-centric analysis of LLMs demonstrates the significant and poorly understood role of input sequences in steering output probabilities, offering a foundational perspective for enhancing language model system capabilities.

  abstract = {This book offers a comprehensive introduction to the central ideas that underpin deep learning. It is intended both for newcomers to machine learning and for those already experienced in the field. Covering key concepts relating to contemporary architectures and techniques, this essential book equips readers with a robust foundation for potential future specialization. The field of deep learning is undergoing rapid evolution, and therefore this book focusses on ideas that are likely to endure the test of time. The book is organized into numerous bite-sized chapters, each exploring a distinct topic, and the narrative follows a linear progression, with each chapter building upon content from its predecessors. This structure is well-suited to teaching a two-semester undergraduate or postgraduate machine learning course, while remaining equally relevant to those engaged in active research or in self-study. A full understanding of machine learning requires some mathematical background and so the book includes a self-contained introduction to probability theory. However, the focus of the book is on conveying a clear understanding of ideas, with emphasis on the real-world practical value of techniques rather than on abstract theory. Complex concepts are therefore presented from multiple complementary perspectives including textual descriptions, diagrams, mathematical formulae, and pseudo-code.},

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

Leveraging this requirement, we develop a distributionally robust joint chance-constrained optimization model for aggregators of flexible resources to optimize their volume of reserve capacity to be offered. Having an aggregator of electric vehicles as a case study, we show how distributional robustness is key for the aggregator when making bidding decisions in a non-stationary uncertain environment.

According to this scenario, nervous systems are a consequence of two preceding animal innovations, external digestion and motility, which have co-evolved in concert with nervous systems ever since.

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden' units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

Instead, we exploit physics to learn in a far simpler way.

  abstract = {Recent language models have shown remarkable results on various complex reasoning benchmarks. The reasoning capabilities of LLMs enable them to execute external function calls to overcome their inherent limitations, such as knowledge cutoffs, poor arithmetic skills, or lack of access to private data. This development has allowed LLMs to select and coordinate multiple functions based on the context to tackle more complex problems. However, current methods for multiple function calling often require sequential reasoning and acting for each function which can result in high latency, cost, and sometimes inaccurate behavior. To address this, we introduce LLMCompiler, which executes functions in parallel to efficiently orchestrate multiple function calling. Drawing from the principles of classical compilers, LLMCompiler streamlines parallel function calling with three components: (i) an LLM Planner, formulating execution plans; (ii) a Task Fetching Unit, dispatching function calling tasks; and (iii) an Executor, executing these tasks in parallel. LLMCompiler automatically generates an optimized orchestration for the function calls and can be used with both open-source and closed-source models. We have benchmarked LLMCompiler on a range of tasks with different patterns of function calling. We observe consistent latency speedup of up to 3.7x, cost savings of up to 6.7x, and accuracy improvement of up to {\textasciitilde}9\% compared to ReAct.},

The ultimate reason for this is Moore's law, or rather its generalization of continued exponentially falling cost per unit of computation. Most AI research has been conducted as if the computation available to the agent were constant (in which case leveraging human knowledge would be one of the only ways to improve performance) but, over a slightly longer time than a typical research project, massively more computation inevitably becomes available. Seeking an improvement that makes a difference in the shorter term, researchers seek to leverage their human knowledge of the domain, but the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation. These two need not run counter to each other, but in practice they tend to. Time spent on one is time not spent on the other. There are psychological commitments to investment in one approach or the other. And the human-knowledge approach tends to complicate methods in ways that make them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging computation.  There were many examples of AI researchers' belated learning of this bitter lesson, and it is instructive to review some of the most prominent.},

  abstract = {Recent research has highlighted the importance of dataset size in scaling language models. However, large language models (LLMs) are notoriously token-hungry during pre-training, and high-quality text data on the web is approaching its scaling limit for LLMs. To further enhance LLMs, a straightforward approach is to repeat the pre-training data for additional epochs. In this study, we empirically investigate three key aspects under this approach. First, we explore the consequences of repeating pre-training data, revealing that the model is susceptible to overfitting, leading to multi-epoch degradation. Second, we examine the key factors contributing to multi-epoch degradation, finding that significant factors include dataset size, model parameters, and training objectives, while less influential factors consist of dataset quality and model FLOPs. Finally, we explore whether widely used regularization can alleviate multi-epoch degradation. Most regularization techniques do not yield significant improvements, except for dropout, which demonstrates remarkable effectiveness but requires careful tuning when scaling up the model size. Additionally, we discover that leveraging mixture-of-experts (MoE) enables cost-effective and efficient hyper-parameter tuning for computationally intensive dense LLMs with comparable trainable parameters, potentially impacting efficient LLM development on a broader scale.},

Dropout regulation lets you repeat training data during training, at least for LLMs. ~Also, mixture of experts help with turning.

We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.},

  abstract = {We introduce and analyze a variant of multivariate singular spectrum analysis (mSSA), a popular time series method to impute and forecast a multivariate time series. Under a spatio-temporal factor model we introduce, given \$N\$ time series and \$T\$ observations per time series, we establish prediction mean-squared-error for both imputation and out-of-sample forecasting effectively scale as \$1 / {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}min(N, T )T\}\$. This is an improvement over: (i) \$1 /{\textbackslash}sqrt\{T\}\$ error scaling of SSA, the restriction of mSSA to a univariate time series; (ii) \$1/{\textbackslash}min(N, T)\$ error scaling for matrix estimation methods which do not exploit temporal structure in the data. The spatio-temporal model we introduce includes any finite sum and products of: harmonics, polynomials, differentiable periodic functions, and Holder continuous functions. Our out-of-sample forecasting result could be of independent interest for online learning under a spatio-temporal factor model. Empirically, on benchmark datasets, our variant of mSSA performs competitively with state-of-the-art neural-network time series methods (e.g. DeepAR, LSTM) and significantly outperforms classical methods such as vector autoregression (VAR). Finally, we propose extensions of mSSA: (i) a variant to estimate time-varying variance of a time series; (ii) a tensor variant which has better sample complexity for certain regimes of \$N\$ and \$T\$.},

  abstract = {A major bottleneck of the current Machine Learning (ML) workflow is the time consuming, error prone engineering required to get data from a datastore or a database (DB) to the point an ML algorithm can be applied to it. Hence, we explore the feasibility of directly integrating prediction functionality on top of a data store or DB. Such a system ideally: (i) provides an intuitive prediction query interface which alleviates the unwieldy data engineering; (ii) provides state-of-the-art statistical accuracy while ensuring incremental model update, low model training time and low latency for making predictions. As the main contribution we explicitly instantiate a proof-of-concept, tspDB, which directly integrates with PostgreSQL. We rigorously test tspDB's statistical and computational performance against the state-of-the-art time series algorithms, including a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) neural network and DeepAR (industry standard deep learning library by Amazon). Statistically, on standard time series benchmarks, tspDB outperforms LSTM and DeepAR with 1.1-1.3x higher relative accuracy. Computationally, tspDB is 59-62x and 94-95x faster compared to LSTM and DeepAR in terms of median ML model training time and prediction query latency, respectively. Further, compared to PostgreSQL's bulk insert time and its SELECT query latency, tspDB is slower only by 1.3x and 2.6x respectively. That is, tspDB is a real-time prediction system in that its model training / prediction query time is similar to just inserting / reading data from a DB. As an algorithmic contribution, we introduce an incremental multivariate matrix factorization based time series method, which tspDB is built off. We show this method also allows one to produce reliable prediction intervals by accurately estimating the time-varying variance of a time series, thereby addressing an important problem in time series analysis.},

  abstract = {Recently there has been a surge of interest in operations research (OR) and the machine learning (ML) community in combining prediction algorithms and optimization techniques to solve decision-making problems in the face of uncertainty. This gave rise to the field of contextual optimization, under which data-driven procedures are developed to prescribe actions to the decision-maker that make the best use of the most recently updated information. A large variety of models and methods have been presented in both OR and ML literature under a variety of names, including data-driven optimization, prescriptive optimization, predictive stochastic programming, policy optimization, (smart) predict/estimate-then-optimize, decision-focused learning, (task-based) end-to-end learning/forecasting/optimization, etc. This survey article unifies these models under the lens of contextual stochastic optimization, thus providing a general presentation of a large variety of problems. We identify three main frameworks for learning policies from data and present the existing models and methods under a uniform notation and terminology. Our objective with this survey is to both strengthen the general understanding of this active field of research and stimulate further theoretical and algorithmic advancements in integrating ML and stochastic programming.},

  abstract = {When designing controllers for safety-critical systems, practitioners often face a challenging tradeoff between robustness and performance. While robust control methods provide rigorous guarantees on system stability under certain worst-case disturbances, they often yield simple controllers that perform poorly in the average (non-worst) case. In contrast, nonlinear control methods trained using deep learning have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many control tasks, but often lack robustness guarantees. In this paper, we propose a technique that combines the strengths of these two approaches: constructing a generic nonlinear control policy class, parameterized by neural networks, that nonetheless enforces the same provable robustness criteria as robust control. Specifically, our approach entails integrating custom convex-optimization-based projection layers into a neural network-based policy. We demonstrate the power of this approach on several domains, improving in average-case performance over existing robust control methods and in worst-case stability over (non-robust) deep RL methods.},

  abstract = {Title: Optimization-in-the-loop ML for energy and climate Speaker: Priya Donti, MIT and Climate Change AI Abstract: Addressing climate change will require concerted action across society, including the development of innovative technologies. While methods from machine learning (ML) have the potential to play an important role, these methods often struggle to contend with the physics, hard constraints, and complex decision-making processes that are inherent to many climate and energy problems. To address these limitations, I present the framework of ``optimization-in-the-loop ML,'' and show how it can enable the design of ML models that explicitly capture relevant constraints and decision-making processes. For instance, this framework can be used to design learning-based controllers that provably enforce the stability criteria or operational constraints associated with the systems in which they operate. It can also enable the design of task-based learning procedures that are cognizant of the downstream decision-making processes for which a model's outputs will be used. By significantly improving performance and preventing critical failures, such techniques can unlock the potential of ML for operating low-carbon power grids, improving energy efficiency in buildings, and addressing other high-impact problems of relevance to climate action. About the speaker: Priya Donti is an Assistant Professor at MIT EECS and LIDS, whose research focuses on machine learning for forecasting, optimization, and control in high-renewables power grids.

However, the criteria by which we train these algorithms often differ from the ultimate criteria on which we evaluate them. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach for learning probabilistic machine learning models in a manner that directly captures the ultimate task-based objective for which they will be used, within the context of stochastic programming. We present three experimental evaluations of the proposed approach: a classical inventory stock problem, a real-world electrical grid scheduling task, and a real-world energy storage arbitrage task.

In this work, we propose PROjected Feasibility (PROF), a method to enforce convex operational constraints within neural policies. Specifically, we incorporate a differentiable projection layer within a neural network-based policy to enforce that all learned actions are feasible. We then update the policy end-to-end by propagating gradients through this differentiable projection layer, making the policy cognizant of the operational constraints. We demonstrate our method on two applications: energy-efficient building operation and inverter control. In the building operation setting, we show that PROF maintains thermal comfort requirements while improving energy efficiency by 4\% over state-of-the-art methods. In the inverter control setting, PROF perfectly satisfies voltage constraints on the IEEE 37-bus feeder system, as it learns to curtail as little renewable energy as possible within its safety set.},

We introduce a method to efficiently solve this minimax formulation, adopting techniques from the literature on adversarial robustness in machine learning to improve scalability and convergence. We demonstrate that our method maintains AC feasibility over a wide range of probabilistic scenarios, and demonstrate the scalability of our method by determining a dispatch for a synthetic 11,000 bus system.},

Specifically, this method enforces feasibility via a differentiable procedure, which implicitly completes partial solutions to satisfy equality constraints and unrolls gradient-based corrections to satisfy inequality constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DC3 in both synthetic optimization tasks and the real-world setting of AC optimal power flow, where hard constraints encode the physics of the electrical grid. In both cases, DC3 achieves near-optimal objective values while preserving feasibility.},

However, it is unclear how meaningful the notion of "zero-shot" generalization is for such multimodal models, as it is not known to what extent their pretraining datasets encompass the downstream concepts targeted for during "zero-shot" evaluation. In this work, we ask: How is the performance of multimodal models on downstream concepts influenced by the frequency of these concepts in their pretraining datasets? We comprehensively investigate this question across 34 models and five standard pretraining datasets (CC-3M, CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M, LAION-Aesthetics), generating over 300GB of data artifacts. We consistently find that, far from exhibiting "zero-shot" generalization, multimodal models require exponentially more data to achieve linear improvements in downstream "zero-shot" performance, following a sample inefficient log-linear scaling trend. This trend persists even when controlling for sample-level similarity between pretraining and downstream datasets, and testing on purely synthetic data distributions. Furthermore, upon benchmarking models on long-tailed data sampled based on our analysis, we demonstrate that multimodal models across the board perform poorly. We contribute this long-tail test set as the "Let it Wag!" benchmark to further research in this direction. Taken together, our study reveals an exponential need for training data which implies that the key to "zero-shot" generalization capabilities under large-scale training paradigms remains to be found.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.},

MLPs, a sequence of linear regressions (trainable weights) separated by nonlinearities (fixed-form nodes) can approximate anything, kind of like a Taylors series. ~There is also the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, in which a similarly simple structure can represent almost anything: ~any multivariate function can be represented by the sum of (trainable) 1-dimensional non-linear functions; there are no weights.

  abstract = {PySR is an open-source library for practical symbolic regression, a type of machine learning which aims to discover human-interpretable symbolic models. PySR was developed to democratize and popularize symbolic regression for the sciences, and is built on a high-performance distributed back-end, a flexible search algorithm, and interfaces with several deep learning packages. PySR's internal search algorithm is a multi-population evolutionary algorithm, which consists of a unique evolve-simplify-optimize loop, designed for optimization of unknown scalar constants in newly-discovered empirical expressions. PySR's backend is the extremely optimized Julia library SymbolicRegression.jl, which can be used directly from Julia. It is capable of fusing user-defined operators into SIMD kernels at runtime, performing automatic differentiation, and distributing populations of expressions to thousands of cores across a cluster. In describing this software, we also introduce a new benchmark, "EmpiricalBench," to quantify the applicability of symbolic regression algorithms in science. This benchmark measures recovery of historical empirical equations from original and synthetic datasets.},

  abstract = {We study the optimal control of battery energy storage under a general ``pay-for-performance'' setup such as providing frequency regulation and renewable integration. In these settings, batteries need to carefully balance the tradeoff between following the instruction signals and their degradation costs in real-time. Existing battery control strategies either do not consider the uncertainty of future signals, or cannot accurately account for battery cycle aging mechanism during operation. In this paper, we take a different approach to the optimal battery control problem. Instead of attacking the complexity of a battery degradation function or the lack of future information one at a time, we address these two challenges together in a joint fashion. In particular, we present an electrochemically accurate and trackable battery degradation model called the rainflow cycle-based model. We prove that the degradation cost is convex. Then, we propose an online control policy with a simple threshold structure and show that it achieves near-optimal performance with respect to an offline controller that has complete future information. We explicitly characterize the optimality gap and show that it is independent to the duration of operation. Simulation results with both synthetic and real regulation traces are conducted to illustrate the theoretical results.},

We propose a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully-connected layers. The architecture has a number of desirable properties, being interpretable, applicable without modification to a wide array of target domains, and fast to train. We test the proposed architecture on several well-known datasets, including M3, M4 and TOURISM competition datasets containing time series from diverse domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for two configurations of N-BEATS for all the datasets, improving forecast accuracy by 11\% over a statistical benchmark and by 3\% over last year's winner of the M4 competition, a domain-adjusted hand-crafted hybrid between neural network and statistical time series models. The first configuration of our model does not employ any time-series-specific components and its performance on heterogeneous datasets strongly suggests that, contrarily to received wisdom, deep learning primitives such as residual blocks are by themselves sufficient to solve a wide range of forecasting problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed architecture can be augmented to provide outputs that are interpretable without considerable loss in accuracy.},

  abstract = {In explainable machine learning, local post-hoc explanation algorithms and inherently interpretable models are often seen as competing approaches. This work offers a partial reconciliation between the two by establishing a correspondence between Shapley Values and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). We introduce \$n\$-Shapley Values, a parametric family of local post-hoc explanation algorithms that explain individual predictions with interaction terms up to order \$n\$. By varying the parameter \$n\$, we obtain a sequence of explanations that covers the entire range from Shapley Values up to a uniquely determined decomposition of the function we want to explain. The relationship between \$n\$-Shapley Values and this decomposition offers a functionally-grounded characterization of Shapley Values, which highlights their limitations. We then show that \$n\$-Shapley Values, as well as the Shapley Taylor- and Faith-Shap interaction indices, recover GAMs with interaction terms up to order \$n\$. This implies that the original Shapely Values recover GAMs without variable interactions. Taken together, our results provide a precise characterization of Shapley Values as they are being used in explainable machine learning. They also offer a principled interpretation of partial dependence plots of Shapley Values in terms of the underlying functional decomposition.

Moreover, a decision maker may not know the exact distribution of such endogenous demand and how it is affected by location choices. In this paper, we consider a distributionally robust facility location problem, in which we interpret the moments of stochastic demand as functions of facility-location decisions. We reformulate a two-stage decision-dependent distributionally robust optimization model as a monolithic formulation, and then derive exact mixed-integer linear programming reformulation as well as valid inequalities when the means and variances of demand are piecewise linear functions of location solutions. We conduct extensive computational studies, in which we compare our model with a decision-dependent deterministic model, as well as stochastic programming and distributionally robust models without the decision-dependent assumption. The results show superior performance of our approach with remarkable improvement in profit and quality of service under various settings, in addition to computational speed-ups given by formulation enhancements. These results draw attention to the need of considering the impact of location decisions on customer demand within this strategic-level planning problem.},

  abstract = {In many modern large-scale decision-making problems, data can be scarce. As a result, traditional methods such as cross-validation perform poorly in evaluating the performance of decision-making policies. In ``Debiasing In-Sample Policy Performance for Small-Data, Large-Scale Optimization,'' Gupta, Huang, and Rusmevichientong propose a novel estimator of the out-of-sample performance for a policy in data-driven optimization. Unlike cross-validation, their approach avoids sacrificing training data for evaluation. As a result, they theoretically show the estimator is asymptotically unbiased as the problem size grows. Furthermore, they show that the estimator is asymptotically optimal when applied to more specialized ``weakly coupled'' optimization problems. Finally, using a case study on dispatching emergency medical response services, they demonstrate their proposed method provides more accurate estimates of out-of-sample performance and selects better policies.           ,              Motivated by the poor performance of cross-validation in settings where data are scarce, we propose a novel estimator of the out-of-sample performance of a policy in data-driven optimization. Our approach exploits the optimization problem's sensitivity analysis to estimate the gradient of the optimal objective value with respect to the amount of noise in the data and uses the estimated gradient to debias the policy's in-sample performance. Unlike cross-validation techniques, our approach avoids sacrificing data for a test set and uses all data when training and hence is well suited to settings where data are scarce. We prove bounds on the bias and variance of our estimator for optimization problems with uncertain linear objectives but known, potentially nonconvex, feasible regions. For more specialized optimization problems where the feasible region is ``weakly coupled'' in a certain sense, we prove stronger results. Specifically, we provide explicit high-probability bounds on the error of our estimator that hold uniformly over a policy class and depends on the problem's dimension and policy class's complexity. Our bounds show that under mild conditions, the error of our estimator vanishes as the dimension of the optimization problem grows, even if the amount of available data remains small and constant. Said differently, we prove our estimator performs well in the small-data, large-scale regime. Finally, we numerically compare our proposed method to state-of-the-art approaches through a case-study on dispatching emergency medical response services using real data. Our method provides more accurate estimates of out-of-sample performance and learns better-performing policies.

  abstract = {We study contextual stochastic optimization problems, where we leverage rich auxiliary observations (e.g., product characteristics) to improve decision making with uncertain variables (e.g., demand). We show how to train forest decision policies for this problem by growing trees that choose splits to directly optimize the downstream decision quality rather than split to improve prediction accuracy as in the standard random forest algorithm. We realize this seemingly computationally intractable problem by developing approximate splitting criteria that use optimization perturbation analysis to eschew burdensome reoptimization for every candidate split, so that our method scales to large-scale problems. We prove that our splitting criteria consistently approximate the true risk and that our method achieves asymptotic optimality. We extensively validate our method empirically, demonstrating the value of optimization-aware construction of forests and the success of our efficient approximations. We show that our approximate splitting criteria can reduce running time hundredfold while achieving performance close to forest algorithms that exactly reoptimize for every candidate split.

  abstract = {Predictive analytics, empowered by machine learning, is usually followed by decision-making problems in prescriptive analytics. We extend the previous sequential prediction-optimization paradigm to a coupled scheme such that the prediction model can guide the decision problem to produce coordinated decisions yielding higher levels of performance. Specifically, for stochastic programming (SP) models with latently decision-dependent uncertainty, without any parametric assumption of the latent dependency, we develop a coupled learning enabled optimization (CLEO) algorithm in which the learning step of predicting the local dependency and the optimization step of computing a candidate decision are conducted interactively. The CLEO algorithm automatically balances the exploration and exploitation via the trust region method with active sampling. Under certain assumptions, we show that the sequence of solutions provided by CLEO converges to a directional stationary point of the original nonconvex and nonsmooth SP problem with probability 1. In addition, we present preliminary experimental results which demonstrate the computational potential of this data-driven approach.},

While recent approaches use Bayesian optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration nonstochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.

To close this gap, we propose HPOBench, which includes 7 existing and 5 new benchmark families, with a total of more than 100 multi-fidelity benchmark problems. HPOBench allows to run this extendable set of multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks in a reproducible way by isolating and packaging the individual benchmarks in containers. It also provides surrogate and tabular benchmarks for computationally affordable yet statistically sound evaluations. To demonstrate HPOBench's broad compatibility with various optimization tools, as well as its usefulness, we conduct an exemplary large-scale study evaluating 13 optimizers from 6 optimization tools.

  abstract = {The end-to-end predict-then-optimize framework, also known as decision-focused learning, has gained popularity for its ability to integrate optimization into the training procedure of machine learning models that predict the unknown cost (objective function) coefficients of optimization problems from contextual instance information. Naturally, most of the problems of interest in this space can be cast as integer linear programs. In this work, we focus on binary linear programs (BLPs) and propose a new end-to-end training method to predict-then-optimize. Our method, Cone-aligned Vector Estimation (CaVE), aligns the predicted cost vectors with the normal cone corresponding to the true optimal solution of a training instance. When the predicted cost vector lies inside the cone, the optimal solution to the linear relaxation of the binary problem is optimal. This alignment not only produces decision-aware learning models, but also dramatically reduces training time as it circumvents the need to solve BLPs to compute a loss function with its gradients. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our method exhibits a favorable trade-off between training time and solution quality, particularly with large-scale optimization problems such as vehicle routing, a hard BLP that has yet to benefit from predict-then-optimize methods in the literature due to its difficulty.},

  abstract = {Many decision-making processes involve solving a combinatorial optimization problem with uncertain input that can be estimated from historic data. Recently, problems in this class have been successfully addressed via end-to-end learning approaches, which rely on solving one optimization problem for each training instance at every epoch. In this context, we provide two distinct contributions. First, we use a Noise Contrastive approach to motivate a family of surrogate loss functions, based on viewing non-optimal solutions as negative examples. Second, we address a major bottleneck of all predict-and-optimize approaches, i.e. the need to frequently recompute optimal solutions at training time. This is done via a solver-agnostic solution caching scheme, and by replacing optimization calls with a lookup in the solution cache. The method is formally based on an inner approximation of the feasible space and, combined with a cache lookup strategy, provides a controllable trade-off between training time and accuracy of the loss approximation. We empirically show that even a very slow growth rate is enough to match the quality of state-of-the-art methods, at a fraction of the computational cost.},

  abstract = {The estimation of nested functions (i.e., functions of functions) is one of the central reasons for the success and popularity of machine learning. Today, artificial neural networks are the predominant class of algorithms in this area, known as representational learning. Here, we introduce Representational Gradient Boosting (RGB), a nonparametric algorithm that estimates functions with multi-layer architectures obtained using backpropagation in the space of functions. RGB does not need to assume a functional form in the nodes or output (e.g., linear models or rectified linear units), but rather estimates these transformations. RGB can be seen as an optimized stacking procedure where a meta algorithm learns how to combine different classes of functions (e.g., Neural Networks (NN) and Gradient Boosting (GB)), while building and optimizing them jointly in an attempt to compensate each other's weaknesses. This highlights a stark difference with current approaches to meta-learning that combine models only after they have been built independently. We showed that providing optimized stacking is one of the main advantages of RGB over current approaches. Additionally, due to the nested nature of RGB we also showed how it improves over GB in problems that have several high-order interactions. Finally, we investigate both theoretically and in practice the problem of recovering nested functions and the value of prior knowledge.},

Although the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) is effective for modeling tabular data, it is non-differentiable with respect to its input, thus suffering from learning multi-layered representation. In this paper, we propose a framework of learning multi-layered GBDT via BP. We approximate the gradient of GBDT based on linear regression. Specifically, we use linear regression to replace the constant value at each leaf ignoring the contribution of individual samples to the tree structure. In this way, we estimate the gradient for intermediate representations, which facilitates BP for multi-layered GBDT. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of performance and representation ability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of optimizing multi-layered GBDT via BP. This work provides a new possibility of exploring deep tree based learning and combining GBDT with neural networks.},

To address this challenge effectively, the incorporation of storage devices can enhance the reliability and efficiency of the grid, improving market liquidity and reducing price volatility. In short-term electricity markets, participants navigate numerous options, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities, underscoring the critical role of the trading strategy in maximizing profits. This study delves into the optimization of day-ahead and balancing market trading, leveraging quantile-based forecasts. Employing three trading approaches with practical constraints, our research enhances forecast assessment, increases trading frequency, and employs flexible timestamp orders. Our findings underscore the profit potential of simultaneous participation in both day-ahead and balancing markets, especially with larger battery storage systems; despite increased costs and narrower profit margins associated with higher-volume trading, the implementation of high-frequency strategies plays a significant role in maximizing profits and addressing market challenges. Finally, we modelled four commercial battery storage systems and evaluated their economic viability through a scenario analysis, with larger batteries showing a shorter return on investment.},

  abstract = {Many real-world analytics problems involve two significant challenges: prediction and optimization. Because of the typically complex nature of each challenge, the standard paradigm is predict-then-optimize. By and large, machine learning tools are intended to minimize prediction error and do not account for how the predictions will be used in the downstream optimization problem. In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart ``Predict, then Optimize'' (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization problem structure---that is, its objective and constraints---for designing better prediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function, which measures the decision error induced by a prediction. Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally challenging, and, thus, we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss function, which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+ loss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild conditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex, or even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical experiments on shortest-path and portfolio-optimization problems show that the SPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the predict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular, when the prediction model being trained is misspecified. We find that linear models trained using SPO+ loss tend to dominate random-forest algorithms, even when the ground truth is highly nonlinear.

Additionally, we explore time series encoders and reveal that patching and attention structures perform similarly to state-of-the-art LLM-based forecasters.},

  abstract = {Today's highly instrumented systems generate large amounts of time series data from many different domains. In order to create meaningful insights from these data, techniques are needed to handle the collection, processing, and analysis at scale. The high frequency and volume of data that is generated introduces several challenges including data transformation, managing concept drift, the operational cost of model re-training and tracking, and scaling hyperparameter optimization.Incremental machine learning can provide a viable solution to handle these kinds of data. Further, distributed machine learning can be an efficient technique to improve performance, increase accuracy, and scale to larger input sizes.In this paper, we introduce a framework that combines the computational capabilities of Apache Spark and the workflow parallelization of Ray for distributed incremental learning. We conduct an empirical analysis of our framework for time series forecasting using the Walmart M5 dataset. The system can perform a parameter search on streaming data with concept drift producing a robust pipeline that fits high-volume data effectively. The results are encouraging and substantiate system proficiency over traditional big data analysis approaches that exclusively use either offline or online training.},

Specifically, the proposed approach uses rough path theory to extract signature path features from the LOB data and compresses them for training machine learning models. We compare the performance of this approach to standard autoregression methods and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of model prediction error. In addition, we use deep neural networks (DNN) and random forest (RF) to further test the proposed approach's performance compared to standard approaches using raw LOB data. The findings show that Sig-DNN, DNN with signature features, outperforms DNN with raw LOB data in terms of prediction error and efficiency, while Sig-RF, RF with signature features, underperformed RF with raw LOB data in terms of prediction but not in efficiency. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple exchanges, including the Johannesburg and New York Stock Exchanges, and the results demonstrate better prediction error and efficiency performance in developed markets compared to emerging markets. Overall, the study highlights the potential of using signature path features with machine learning techniques for predicting the mean-mid stock price.},

We also contrast some classical approaches of market simulation with simulation based on generative modelling and highlight some advantages and pitfalls of the new approach. While most generative models tend to rely on large amounts of training data, we present here a generative model that works reliably in environments where the amount of available training data is notoriously small.

First, the variations on the signature method are unified into a general approach, the {\textbackslash}emph\{generalised signature method\}, of which previous variations are special cases. A primary aim of this unifying framework is to make the signature method more accessible to any machine learning practitioner, whereas it is now mostly used by specialists. Second, and within this framework, we derive a canonical collection of choices that provide a domain-agnostic starting point. We derive these choices as a result of an extensive empirical study on 26 datasets and go on to show competitive performance against current benchmarks for multivariate time series classification.

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) based time series forecasting models often require and assume certain degrees of stationarity in the data when producing forecasts. However, in many real-world situations, the data distributions are not stationary and they can change over time while reducing the accuracy of the forecasting models, which in the ML literature is known as concept drift. Handling concept drift in forecasting is essential for many ML methods in use nowadays, however, the prior work only proposes methods to handle concept drift in the classification domain. To fill this gap, we explore concept drift handling methods in particular for Global Forecasting Models (GFM) which recently have gained popularity in the forecasting domain. We propose two new concept drift handling methods, namely: Error Contribution Weighting (ECW) and Gradient Descent Weighting (GDW), based on a continuous adaptive weighting concept. These methods use two forecasting models which are separately trained with the most recent series and all series, and finally, the weighted average of the forecasts provided by the two models are considered as the final forecasts. Using LightGBM as the underlying base learner, in our evaluation on three simulated datasets, the proposed models achieve significantly higher accuracy},

  abstract = {The Transformer model has shown leading performance in time series forecasting. Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high-frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs.

Standard transformers are biased towards captuing low freq signals; the reason is that they have high energy. ~This model aims to fix that. ~Has code, and a lighter weight version of this algorithm.

  abstract = {The detection of different types of concept drift has wide applications in the fields of cloud computing and security information detection. Concept drift detection can indeed assist in promptly identifying instances where model performance deteriorates or when there are changes in data distribution. This paper focuses on the problem of concept drift detection in order to conduct frequent pattern mining. To address the limitation of fixed sliding windows in adapting to evolving data streams, we propose a variable sliding window frequent pattern mining algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the window size to adapt to new concept drifts and detect them in a timely manner. Furthermore, considering the challenge of existing concept drift detection algorithms that struggle to adapt to different types of drifting data simultaneously, we introduce an additional dual-layer embedded variable sliding window. This approach helps differentiate types of concept drift and incorporates a decay model for drift adaptation. The proposed algorithm can effectively detect different types of concept drift in data streams, perform targeted drift adaptation, and exhibit efficiency in terms of time complexity and memory consumption. Additionally, the algorithm maintains stable performance, avoiding abrupt changes due to window size variations and ensuring overall robustness.},

  abstract = {Industrial ML models are primarily data-driven. Therefore, one of the main focus for monitoring the model should be towards identifying the drifts in the data that might affect the performance of the model. The traditional drift detecting methods are usually based on some assumptions related to the underlying data such as no inter-dependence. However industrial sensor data typically consists of time series data, which is collected at regular intervals. Therefore, detecting drift in dependent data where the current readings depend on the previously registered readings demands a different approach. Existing solutions require either the ground truth, a fixed size, or the underlying model details. We propose an Unsupervised Drift Detection method for industrial Time series data or UDDT, a generic approach with no such pre-requisites. In our approach, we can check whether two series belong to the same model. Apart from detecting the drift in the two series, it can also provide the rationale behind the observed drift, i.e., whether the drift is due to a difference in stationarity, correlation structures, or noise distributions. We evaluate the UDDT on two datasets to demonstrate its correctness and the trust regions under various circumstances. We also establish its applicability for the real industrial setting.

  abstract = {Abstract             Electricity price forecasting is crucial for grid management, renewable energy integration, power system planning, and price volatility management. However, poor accuracy due to complex generation mix data and heteroskedasticity poses a challenge for utilities and grid operators. This paper evaluates advanced analytics methods that utilize principal component analysis (PCA) to improve forecasting accuracy amidst heteroskedastic noise. Drawing on the experience of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), a leading producer of renewable electricity, the study analyzes hourly electricity prices and demand data from 2016 to 2021 to assess the impact of day-ahead forecasting on California's evolving generation mix. To enhance data quality, traditional outlier analysis using the interquartile range (IQR) method is first applied, followed by a novel supervised PCA technique called robust PCA (RPCA) for more effective outlier detection and elimination. The combined approach significantly improves data symmetry and reduces skewness. Multiple linear regression models are then constructed to forecast electricity prices using both raw and transformed features obtained through PCA. Results demonstrate that the model utilizing transformed features, after outlier removal using the traditional method and SAS Sparse Matrix method, achieves the highest forecasting performance. Notably, the SAS Sparse Matrix outlier removal method, implemented via proc RPCA, greatly contributes to improved model accuracy. This study highlights that PCA methods enhance electricity price forecasting accuracy, facilitating the integration of renewables like solar and wind, thereby aiding grid management and promoting renewable growth in day-ahead markets.

  abstract = {Predicting the price gap between the day-ahead Market (DAM) and the real-time Market (RTM) plays a vital role in the convergence bidding mechanism of Independent System Operators (ISOs) in wholesale electricity markets. This paper presents a model to predict the values of the price gap between the DAM and RTM using statistical machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks. In this paper, we seek to answer these questions: What will be the impact of predicting the DAM and RTM price gap directly on the prediction performance of learning methods? How can exogenous weather data affect the price gap prediction? In this paper, several exogenous features are collected, and the impacts of these features are examined to capture the best relations between the features and the target variable. An ensemble learning algorithm, namely the Random Forest (RF), is used to select the most important features. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used to capture long-term dependencies in predicting direct gap values between the markets stated. Moreover, the advantages of directly predicting the gap price rather than subtracting the price predictions of the DAM and RTM are shown. The presented results are based on the California Independent System Operator (CAISO)'s electricity market data for two years. The results show that direct gap prediction using exogenous weather features decreases the error of learning methods by 46\%. Therefore, the presented method mitigates the prediction error of the price gap between the DAM and RTM. Thus, the convergence bidders can increase their profit, and the ISOs can tune their mechanism accordingly.},

Despite the benefits of VRE for decarbonization, it has garnered some controversy for inducing unwanted effects in regional electricity markets. In this study, the role of VRE penetration is examined on the system electricity price and price volatility based on hourly, real-time, historical data from six independent system operators (ISOs) in the US using quantile and skew t-distribution regressions. After correcting for temporal effects, we found an increase in VRE penetration is associated with a decrease in system electricity price in all ISOs studied. The increase in VRE penetration is associated with a decrease in temporal price volatility in five out of six ISOs studied. The relationships are nonlinear. These results are consistent with the modern portfolio theory where diverse volatile assets may lead to more stable and less risky portfolios.},

  abstract = {In the United States, an independent system operator (ISO) controls and monitors the operation of the electrical power system within a given perime- ter. In California, CAISO also acts as the electricity market operator. In this project we focus our attention on the day ahead market (DAM) for electric- ity. This market takes place one day prior to the operating day and consists of scheduling the quantities and marginal electricity prices (wholesale) for each hour. We will denote p {$\in$} R24 the DAM price for a given day. The marginal clearing price corresponds to the intersection between the supply and demand curve: these curves are formed by CAISO who receive bids from all the market participants (essentially: electricity retailers, gener- ators, and virtual bidders). Figure 1 gives an overview of the DAM market process, while Figure 2 illustrates the obtainment of the market clearing price for a given hour. CAISO has the specificity of having different clearing prices based on lo- cation, this is done with the purpose of including externalities of electricity losses (around 6\% on the transmission grid [6]), and electricity congestion in the final price [7]. All in all, the clearing price in the DAM is specific to a location (or node), and is referred to as Local Marginal Price (LMP). It is essential for a market participant to be able to predict the DAM price before submitting it's bid to CAISO. That is why in a first step we decided to build a prediction model for the DAM price (average price in the system, not the LMP). It is also important for the market participant to understand the underlying risk when making a bid: that is why we studied the error between our prediction and the realized price. In a second step, we examined and visualized the LMP behavior, which is particularly interesting if we want to understand the local market power an agent can have.},

  abstract = {This paper examines wholesale price behavior of energy and ancillary services (AS) in the day-ahead market (DAM) and real-time market (RTM) of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), the second largest regional transmission organization in the U.S. Using hourly data for the period of 12/19/2013 to 12/30/2017, it estimates a system of 16 electricity price regressions that recognizes the interdependence of MISO's electricity products. Its key findings are: (1) MISO's regional DAM energy prices increase with the day-ahead forecasts of natural gas price and MISO's regional loads, PJM's DAM energy price at its MISO interface, and MISO's DAM AS requirements; (2) MISO's regional DAM energy prices decline with DAM schedules for nuclear and wind generation; (3) MISO's regional RTM energy prices increase with, but diverge from, MISO's regional DAM energy prices; (4) MISO's system-average DAM AS prices increase with MISO's system-average DAM energy price and procured amounts of AS; and (5) MISO's system-average RTM AS prices increase with MISO's system-average RTM energy price and system-average DAM AS prices. These findings imply that MISO can reduce its DAM and RTM prices for energy and AS by accelerating wind generation development, expanding demand-side-management, and easing inter-regional transmission congestion.},

Focusing on the long delay itself on behalf of machine learning practitioners, our goal is to accelerate generalization of a model under grokking phenomenon. By regarding a series of gradients of a parameter over training iterations as a random signal over time, we can spectrally decompose the parameter trajectories under gradient descent into two components: the fast-varying, overfitting-yielding component and the slow-varying, generalization-inducing component. This analysis allows us to accelerate the grokking phenomenon more than \${\textbackslash}times 50\$ with only a few lines of code that amplifies the slow-varying components of gradients. The experiments show that our algorithm applies to diverse tasks involving images, languages, and graphs, enabling practical availability of this peculiar artifact of sudden generalization.

In some situations we show that neural networks learn through a process of "grokking" a pattern in the data, improving generalization performance from random chance level to perfect generalization, and that this improvement in generalization can happen well past the point of overfitting. We also study generalization as a function of dataset size and find that smaller datasets require increasing amounts of optimization for generalization. We argue that these datasets provide a fertile ground for studying a poorly understood aspect of deep learning: generalization of overparametrized neural networks beyond memorization of the finite training dataset.},

  abstract = {This thesis deals with the development of new mathematical models that support the decision-making processes of market players. It addresses the problems of demand-side bidding, price-responsive load forecasting and reserve determination.  From a methodological point of view, we investigate a novel approach to model the response of aggregate price-responsive load as a constrained optimization model, whose parameters are estimated from data by using inverse optimization techniques.The problems tackled in this dissertation are motivated, on one hand, by the increasing penetration of renewable energy production and smart grid technologies in power systems, that is expected to continue growing in the coming years.  Non-dispatchable electricity generation cannot ensure a certain production at all times, since it depends on meteorological factors. Also, smart grid technologies are affecting the consumption patterns that the load traditionally exhibited. On the other hand, this thesis is motivated by the decision-making processes of market players. In response to these challenges, this thesis provides mathematical models for decision-making under uncertainty in electricity markets.  Demand-side bidding refers to the participation of consumers, often through a retailer, in energy trading. Under the smart-grid paradigm, the demand bids must reflect the elasticity of the consumers to changes in electricity price. Traditional forecasting models are typically not able to reflect this elasticity, hence we propose two novel approaches to estimate market bids. Both approaches are data-driven and take into account the uncertainty of future factors, as, for example, price. In both cases, demand-side bids that comprise a price-energy term decrease the expected imbalances and also increase the profit of retailers participating in electricity markets.In the field of load forecasting, this thesis provides a novel approach to model time series and forecast loads under the real-time pricing setup. The relationship between price and aggregate response of the load is characterized by an optimization problem, which is shaped by a set of unknown parameters. Such parameters are estimated from data by using an inverse optimization framework.  The usability of the proposed method is studied and we conclude that inverseoptimization-based modeling is a computationally attractive method that outperforms the forecasting capabilities of traditional time series models.  Regarding the reserve determination, the special characteristics of the Danish power system do not allow for co-optimizing the unit commitment and reserve requirements. Hence, we propose a probabilistic framework, where the reserve requirements are computed based on scenarios of wind power and load forecast errors and power plant outages. The solution of the stochastic optimization models increases the safety of the overall system while decreases the associated reserve costs, with respect to the method currently used by the Danish TSO.},

An issue that merits special attention is the precipitous net load ramps, which require SOs to have flexible capacity at their disposal so as to maintain the supply-demand balance at all times. In the judicious procurement and deployment of flexible capacity, a tool that forecasts net load ramps may be of great assistance to SOs. To this end, we propose a methodology to forecast the magnitude and start time of daily primary three-hour net load ramps. We perform an extensive analysis so as to identify the factors that influence net load and draw on the identified factors to develop a forecasting methodology that harnesses the long short-term memory model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on the CAISO system using comparative assessments with selected benchmarks based on various evaluation metrics.},

  abstract = {How can independent system operators (ISOs) take advantage of probabilistic solar forecasts to lower generation costs and improve reliability of power systems? We discuss one three-step approach for doing so, focusing on how such forecasts might help the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) prepare unexpected net load ramps, where net load equals gross demand minus wind and solar production. First, we enhance an existing solar forecasting system to provide well-calibrated hours-ahead probabilistic forecasts. We then relate the degree of uncertainty reflected in the forecasted prediction intervals (independent variables) to error distributions for net load ramp forecasts for the CAISO real-time market (dependent variable) using machine learning and quantile regression. Projected ramp forecast errors conditioned on solar uncertainty are translated into flexible ramp requirements that therefore reflect real-time meteorological and solar conditions, improving on typical ISO procedures. Detailed descriptions are provided on the quantile regression and kth-nearest neighbor categorization methods for accomplishing that translation. Finally, a multiple time-scale look-ahead market simulation model is applied to a 118-bus IEEE Reliability Test System, modified to represent the CAISO generation mix and demand distributions. The model runs quantify how solar-conditioned ramp requirements can, first, decrease operating costs by reducing requirements compared to often conservative unconditional methods and, second, decrease generation scarcity events and consequently improve reliability by increasing flexibility requirements at times when unconditional forecast-based requirements understate actual ramp uncertainty. Solar-conditioned ramp requirements are found to reduce generation operating costs by about 2\% for the test system (which would be equivalent to over \$100 million per year for a CAISO-size system).},

This framework adopts a bilevel model to compute the optimal VRES day-ahead bids. It aims to minimize the expected system cost across day-ahead and real-time stages and approximate the cost efficiency of the stochastic market design. However, solving the bilevel optimization problem is computationally challenging for large-scale systems. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel technique based on strong duality and McCormick envelopes, which relaxes the problem to a linear program, enabling large-scale applications. The proposed bilevel framework is applied to the 1576-bus NYISO system and benchmarked against a myopic strategy, where the VRES bid is the mean value of the probabilistic power forecast. Results demonstrate that, under high VRES penetration levels (e.g., 40\%), our framework can significantly reduce system costs and market-price volatility, by optimizing VRES quantities efficiently in the day-ahead market. Furthermore, we find that when transmission capacity increases, the proposed bilevel model will still reduce the system cost, whereas the myopic strategy may incur a much higher cost due to over-scheduling of VRES in the day-ahead market and the lack of flexible conventional generators in real time.},

The approach is based on the statistical analysis of actual historical area control error (ACE) and regulation procurement in the CAISO system. The CAISO baseline method uses day-ahead (DA) information and does not statistically relate requirements in real time. In this work, we examine the benefit of setting requirements in real time, and the proposed method presents advantages rather than the present DA approach by using additional 1-hour-ahead (1HA) independent variables to estimate requirements. By adopting a time series forecasting technique, the approach estimates regulation reserve requirements on an hourly basis. More specifically, a neural network based upon a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX), which accounts for temporal continuity and autocorrelation, is leveraged for regulation requirements estimation. The proposed approach incorporates multiple time-series variables that might affect the system balance (e.g., solar, wind, and load). Two metrics are adopted to evaluate method performance: 1) frequency of shortage, and 2) oversupply of the regulation reserve requirement. By dynamically tuning the parameters of the procurement strategies, system regulation reserve requirements were reduced without compromising system reliability, improving both system reliability and economics.},

This makes power system reserve scheduling more challenging. Most of the current reserve requirement determination methods calculate reserve requirements based on historical data, which does not consider the real-time or future system uncertainty. In this paper, a data-driven method is developed to determine the non-spinning reserve requirement (NSRR) in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system. The method follows the procedure of the current ERCOT method while adaptively determining the NSRR based on probabilistic net load forecasts. Case studies with two years of ERCOT data show that the developed method significantly reduces the NSRR by introducing an adaptive temporal resolution and update rate. Sensitivity analysis with different forecasting and percentile thresholds indicates the flexibility of the developed method.},

  abstract = {The goal of quantile regression is to estimate conditional quantiles for specified values of quantile probability using linear or nonlinear regression equations. These estimates are prone to ``quantile crossing'', where regression predictions for different quantile probabilities do not increase as probability increases. In the context of the environmental sciences, this could, for example, lead to estimates of the magnitude of a 10-year return period rainstorm that exceed the 20-year storm, or similar nonphysical results. This problem, as well as the potential for overfitting, is exacerbated for small to moderate sample sizes and for nonlinear quantile regression models. As a remedy, this study introduces a novel nonlinear quantile regression model, the monotone composite quantile regression neural network (MCQRNN), that (1) simultaneously estimates multiple non-crossing, nonlinear conditional quantile functions; (2) allows for optional monotonicity, positivity/non-negativity, and generalized additive model constraints; and (3) can be adapted to estimate standard least-squares regression and non-crossing expectile regression functions. First, the MCQRNN model is evaluated on synthetic data from multiple functions and error distributions using Monte Carlo simulations. MCQRNN outperforms the benchmark models, especially for non-normal error distributions. Next, the MCQRNN model is applied to real-world climate data by estimating rainfall Intensity--Duration--Frequency (IDF) curves at locations in Canada. IDF curves summarize the relationship between the intensity and occurrence frequency of extreme rainfall over storm durations ranging from minutes to a day. Because annual maximum rainfall intensity is a non-negative quantity that should increase monotonically as the occurrence frequency and storm duration decrease, monotonicity and non-negativity constraints are key constraints in IDF curve estimation. In comparison to standard QRNN models, the ability of the MCQRNN model to incorporate these constraints, in addition to non-crossing, leads to more robust and realistic estimates of extreme rainfall.},

Motivated by linear noncrossing quantile regression, we propose a noncrossing quantile neural network model with inequality constraints.

  abstract = {Purpose: This research assesses the efficacy of conformal regression and standard quantile regression in uncertainty quantification for predictive modeling. Quantile regression estimates various quantiles within the conditional distribution, while conformal regression constructs prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. Methodology: By training models on multiple quantile pairs and varying error rates, the analysis evaluates each method's performance. Findings: Results indicate consistent trends in coverage and prediction interval lengths, with no significant differences in performance. Quantile regression intervals lengthen toward the distribution tails, while conformal regression intervals lengthen with higher coverage. Unique contribution to theory, policy and practice: On the tested dataset, both methods perform similarly, but further testing is necessary to validate these findings across diverse datasets and conditions, considering computational efficiency and implementation ease to determine the best method for specific applications.},

In contrast with the existing, this approach is distribution-free (as for non-parametric and quantile-based approaches) and can directly yield continuous probability densities, hence avoiding quantile crossing. It relies on a base distribution and a set of bijective mappings. Both the shape parameters of the base distribution and the bijective mappings are approximated with neural networks. Spline-based conditional normalizing flow is considered owing to its non-affine characteristics. Over the training phase, the model sequentially maps input examples onto samples of base distribution, given the conditional contexts, where parameters are estimated through maximum likelihood. To issue probabilistic forecasts, one eventually maps samples of the base distribution into samples of a desired distribution. Case studies based on open datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and allows us to discuss its advantages and caveats with respect to the state of the art.},

This paper describes a unique and elegant solution to the problem based on a flexible check function that is easy to understand and implement in R and Python, while greatly reducing or even eliminating the crossing problem entirely. It will be very important in all areas where quantile regression is routinely used and may also find application in robust regression, especially in the context of machine learning.

Our method exploits the probability integral transform and relies on permuting estimated ranks.

However, predictions are inherently uncertain, and managing prediction uncertainty presents significant challenges in environments characterized by complex dynamics and forking trajectories. In this work, we assume access to a pre-designed probabilistic implicit or explicit sequence model, which may have been obtained using model-based or model-free methods. We introduce probabilistic time series-conformal risk prediction (PTS-CRC), a novel post-hoc calibration procedure that operates on the predictions produced by any pre-designed probabilistic forecaster to yield reliable error bars. In contrast to existing art, PTS-CRC produces predictive sets based on an ensemble of multiple prototype trajectories sampled from the sequence model, supporting the efficient representation of forking uncertainties. Furthermore, unlike the state of the art, PTS-CRC can satisfy reliability definitions beyond coverage. This property is leveraged to devise a novel model predictive control (MPC) framework that addresses open-loop and closed-loop control problems under general average constraints on the quality or safety of the control policy. We experimentally validate the performance of PTS-CRC prediction and control by studying a number of use cases in the context of wireless networking. Across all the considered tasks, PTS-CRC predictors are shown to provide more informative predictive sets, as well as safe control policies with larger returns.},

  abstract = {Quantile regression is a fundamental problem in statistical learning motivated by a need to quantify uncertainty in predictions, or to model a diverse population without being overly reductive. For instance, epidemiological forecasts, cost estimates, and revenue predictions all benefit from being able to quantify the range of possible values accurately. As such, many models have been developed for this problem over many years of research in statistics, machine learning, and related fields. Rather than proposing yet another (new) algorithm for quantile regression we adopt a meta viewpoint: we investigate methods for aggregating any number of conditional quantile models, in order to improve accuracy and robustness. We consider weighted ensembles where weights may vary over not only individual models, but also over quantile levels, and feature values. All of the models we consider in this paper can be fit using modern deep learning toolkits, and hence are widely accessible (from an implementation point of view) and scalable. To improve the accuracy of the predicted quantiles (or equivalently, prediction intervals), we develop tools for ensuring that quantiles remain monotonically ordered, and apply conformal calibration methods. These can be used without any modification of the original library of base models. We also review some basic theory surrounding quantile aggregation and related scoring rules, and contribute a few new results to this literature (for example, the fact that post sorting or post isotonic regression can only improve the weighted interval score). Finally, we provide an extensive suite of empirical comparisons across 34 data sets from two different benchmark repositories.},

In this work, we develop a sequential CP method called \${\textbackslash}texttt\{MultiDimSPCI\}\$ that builds prediction \${\textbackslash}textit\{regions\}\$ for a multivariate response, especially in the context of multivariate time series, which are not exchangeable. Theoretically, we estimate \${\textbackslash}textit\{finite-sample\}\$ high-probability bounds on the conditional coverage gap. Empirically, we demonstrate that \${\textbackslash}texttt\{MultiDimSPCI\}\$ maintains valid coverage on a wide range of multivariate time series while producing smaller prediction regions than CP and non-CP baselines.},

  abstract = {Trajectory prediction models that can infer both finite future trajectories and their associated uncertainties of the target vehicles in an online setting (e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.},

However, recent studies have reported the method's vulnerability to low quality predictors when the set of regressors is larger than just a few. To address this issue, we consider a regularized variant of QRA, which utilizes the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to automatically select the relevant regressors. We evaluate the introduced technique -- dubbed LASSO QRA or LQRA for short -- using datasets from the Polish and Nordic power markets. By comparing against a number of benchmarks, we provide evidence for its superior predictive performance in terms of the Kupiec test, the pinball score and the test for conditional predictive accuracy, as well as financial profits for a range of trading strategies, especially when the regularization parameter is selected ex-ante using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). As such, we offer an efficient tool that can be used to boost the profitability of energy trading activities, help with bidding in day-ahead markets and improve risk management practices in the power sector.},

EPF has attracted enormous interest from both practitioners and scholars since the deregulation of the power market and wide applications of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar energy. However, forecasting the electricity price accurately and efficiently is an extremely challenging task because of its high volatility, randomness, and fluctuation. Although quantile regression averaging (QRA) has been demonstrated to be efficacious in probabilistic EPF since the global energy forecasting competition in 2014 (GEFCom2014), it is sensitive to nuisance variables especially when the number of variables is large. The forecasting accuracy will be negatively affected by these nuisance variables. To address these challenges, this study investigates a nonconvex regularized QRA in probabilistic forecasting. Two types of nonconvex regularized QRA select the important inputs obtained from point forecasting to obtain more accurate forecasting outcomes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EPF model, two real datasets from the European power market are considered.},

Our confidence sets are highly adaptive to the local structure of the data, making them particularly useful in high heteroskedasticity situations.

  abstract = {Electricity price forecasting (EPF) plays a major role for electricity companies as a fundamental entry for trading decisions or energy management operations. As electricity can not be stored, electricity prices are highly volatile which make EPF a particularly difficult task. This is all the more true when dramatic fortuitous events disrupt the markets. Trading and more generally energy management decisions require risk management tools which are based on probabilistic EPF (PEPF). In this challenging context, we argue in favor of the deployment of highly adaptive black-boxes strategies allowing to turn any forecasts into a robust adaptive predictive interval, such as conformal prediction and online aggregation, as a fundamental last layer of any operational pipeline. We propose to investigate a novel data set containing the French electricity spot prices during the turbulent 2020-2021 years, and build a new explanatory feature revealing high predictive power, namely the nuclear availability. Benchmarking state-of-the-art PEPF on this data set highlights the difficulty of choosing a given model, as they all behave very differently in practice, and none of them is reliable. However, we propose an adequate conformalisation, OSSCP-horizon, that improves the performances of PEPF methods, even in the most hazardous period of late 2021. Finally, we emphasize that combining it with online aggregation significantly outperforms any other approaches, and should be the preferred pipeline, as it provides trustworthy probabilistic forecasts.},

  abstract = {Predictive models make mistakes. Hence, there is a need to quantify the uncertainty associated with their predictions. Conformal inference has emerged as a powerful tool to create statistically valid prediction regions around point predictions, but its naive application to regression problems yields non-adaptive regions. New conformal scores, often relying upon quantile regressors or conditional density estimators, aim to address this limitation. Although they are useful for creating prediction bands, these scores are detached from the original goal of quantifying the uncertainty around an arbitrary predictive model. This paper presents a new, model-agnostic family of methods to calibrate prediction intervals for regression problems with local coverage guarantees. Our approach is based on pursuing the coarsest partition of the feature space that approximates conditional coverage. We create this partition by training regression trees and Random Forests on conformity scores. Our proposal is versatile, as it applies to various conformity scores and prediction settings and demonstrates superior scalability and performance compared to established baselines in simulated and real-world datasets. We provide a Python package clover that implements our methods using the standard scikit-learn interface.},

Unfortunately, the exchangeability assumption is frequently violated due to distribution shifts in practice, and the challenge is often compounded by the lack of ground truth labels at test time. Focusing on classification in this paper, our goal is to improve the quality of CP-generated prediction sets using only unlabeled data from the test domain. This is achieved by two new methods called ECP and EACP, that adjust the score function in CP according to the base model's uncertainty on the unlabeled test data. Through extensive experiments on a number of large-scale datasets and neural network architectures, we show that our methods provide consistent improvement over existing baselines and nearly match the performance of supervised algorithms.},

  abstract = {Quantile regression is widely applied in various fields such as economy, energy, meteorological prediction research in recent years since it does not require distribution assumptions, has relatively loose conditions, and can effectively estimate the uncertainty of time series forecasting. In this paper, a monotone quantile regression neural network (MQRNN) framework is constructed for time series quantile forecasting. The proposed approach takes the monotonicity of quantile into consideration and handles the quantile crossing problem by adding the quantile information into the input structure and using the gradient based point-wise loss function. Aiming at the complex characteristics of time series, such as time-varying and asymmetric heavy-tailed features, a new quantile function is utilized to describe the complete conditional distribution information of data. Under this model framework, non-crossing multiple quantiles can be predicted simultaneously. The proposed approach is implemented based on artificial neural networks, and the constructed model is applied to actual data in different fields. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) can provide accurate and reliable multi-quantile prediction, and alleviate the problem of quantile crossing.},

Neural networks can naturally incorporate additional structure in the data. We develop a recurrent version of EQRN that is able to capture complex sequential dependence in time series. We apply this method to forecast flood risk in the Swiss Aare catchment. It exploits information from multiple covariates in space and time to provide one-day-ahead predictions of return levels and exceedance probabilities. This output complements the static return level from a traditional extreme value analysis, and the predictions are able to adapt to distributional shifts as experienced in a changing climate. Our model can help authorities to manage flooding more effectively and to minimize their disastrous impacts through early warning systems.},

EnCQR constructs distribution-free and approximately marginally valid prediction intervals (PIs), which are suitable for nonstationary and heteroscedastic time series data. EnCQR can be applied on top of a generic forecasting model, including deep learning architectures. EnCQR exploits a bootstrap ensemble estimator, which enables the use of conformal predictors for time series by removing the requirement of data exchangeability. The ensemble learners are implemented as generic machine learning algorithms performing quantile regression (QR), which allow the length of the PIs to adapt to local variability in the data. In the experiments, we predict time series characterized by a different amount of heteroscedasticity. The results demonstrate that EnCQR outperforms models based only on QR or conformal prediction (CP), and it provides sharper, more informative, and valid PIs.},

While research has primarily focused on achieving increasingly efficient valid intervals, we argue that, when evaluating a set of intervals, traditional measures alone are insufficient. There are additional crucial characteristics: the intervals must vary in length, with this variation directly linked to the difficulty of the prediction, and the coverage of the interval must remain independent of the difficulty of the prediction for practical utility. We propose the Heteroscedastic Quantile Regression (HQR) model and the Width-Adaptive Conformal Inference (WACI) method, providing theoretical coverage guarantees, to overcome those issues, respectively. The methodologies are evaluated in the context of Electricity Price Forecasting and Wind Power Forecasting, representing complex scenarios in time series forecasting. The results demonstrate that HQR and WACI not only improve or achieve typical measures of validity and efficiency but also successfully fulfil the commonly ignored mentioned characteristics.},

This article introduce a new method dubbed Smoothing Quantile Regression (SQR) Averaging, that improves on well-performing schemes for probabilistic forecasting. To showcase its utility, a comprehensive study is conducted across four power markets, including recent data encompassing the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion on Ukraine. The performance of SQR Averaging is evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art benchmark methods in terms of the reliability and sharpness measures. Additionally, an evaluation scheme is introduced to quantify the economic benefits derived from SQR Averaging predictions. This scheme can be applied in any day-ahead electricity market and is based on a trading strategy that leverages battery storage and sets limit orders using selected quantiles of the predictive distribution. The results reveal that, compared to the benchmark strategy, utilizing SQR Averaging leads to average profit increases of up to 14\%. These findings provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of SQR Averaging in improving forecast accuracy and the practical value of utilizing probabilistic forecasts in day-ahead electricity trading, even in the face of challenging events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical disruptions.},

We hypothesise that memorising circuits become more inefficient with larger training datasets while generalising circuits do not, suggesting there is a critical dataset size at which memorisation and generalisation are equally efficient. We make and confirm four novel predictions about grokking, providing significant evidence in favour of our explanation. Most strikingly, we demonstrate two novel and surprising behaviours: ungrokking, in which a network regresses from perfect to low test accuracy, and semi-grokking, in which a network shows delayed generalisation to partial rather than perfect test accuracy.},

  abstract = {Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular uncertainty quantification method that provides distribution-free, statistically valid prediction sets, assuming that training and test data are exchangeable. In such a case, CP's prediction sets are guaranteed to cover the (unknown) true test output with a user-specified probability. Nevertheless, this guarantee is violated when the data is subjected to adversarial attacks, which often result in a significant loss of coverage. Recently, several approaches have been put forward to recover CP guarantees in this setting. These approaches leverage variations of randomised smoothing to produce conservative sets which account for the effect of the adversarial perturbations. They are, however, limited in that they only support {$\ell$}2-bounded perturbations and classification tasks. This paper introduces VRCP (Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction), a new framework that leverages recent neural network verification methods to recover coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks. Our VRCP method is the first to support perturbations bounded by arbitrary norms including {$\ell$}1, {$\ell$}2, and {$\ell\infty$}, as well as regression tasks. We evaluate and compare our approach on image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet) and regression tasks for deep reinforcement learning environments. In every case, VRCP achieves above nominal coverage and yields significantly more efficient and informative prediction regions than the SotA.},

To express uncertainty in load predictions in the form of a probabilistic forecast, prediction intervals are generated. The variability in load values exhibits higher volatility during the day due to increased human activities, contrasting with lower variability at night. Classic methods for constructing prediction intervals cannot correctly model the variability in uncertainty leading to overly conservative prediction intervals. In this paper, we propose a novel approach -- conformalized quantile regression -- to create more informative, variable-length prediction intervals. Experimental results, based on a real load dataset from the Croatian Transmission System, showcase the method's superior performance in capturing adaptivelength prediction intervals.

Although most works have focused on point prediction, it is currently becoming important to also estimate the forecast uncertainty. With regard to forecasting methods, deep neural networks have shown good performance in many fields. However, the use of these networks for comparative studies of probabilistic forecasts of renewable energies, especially for regional forecasts, has not yet received much attention. The aim of this article is to study the performance of deep networks for estimating multiple conditional quantiles on regional renewable electricity production and compare them with widely used quantile regression methods such as the linear, support vector quantile regression, gradient boosting quantile regression, natural gradient boosting and quantile regression forest methods. A grid of numerical weather prediction variables covers the region of interest. These variables act as the predictors of the regional model. In addition to quantiles, prediction intervals are also constructed, and the models are evaluated using different metrics. These prediction intervals are further improved through an adapted conformalized quantile regression methodology. Overall, the results show that deep networks are the best performing method for both solar and wind energy regions, producing narrow prediction intervals with good coverage.},

Reliable PI estimators in this setting must address two distinct notions of coverage: cross-sectional coverage across a cross-sectional slice, and longitudinal coverage along the temporal dimension for each time series. Recent works have explored adapting Conformal Prediction (CP) to obtain PIs in the time series context. However, none handles both notions of coverage simultaneously. CP methods typically query a pre-specified quantile from the distribution of nonconformity scores on a calibration set. TQA adjusts the quantile to query in CP at each time t, accounting for both cross-sectional and longitudinal coverage in a theoretically-grounded manner. The post-hoc nature of TQA facilitates its use as a general wrapper around any time series regression model. We validate TQA's performance through extensive experimentation: TQA generally obtains efficient PIs and improves longitudinal coverage while preserving cross-sectional coverage.

  abstract = {Copula-based models provide a great deal of {\'a}exibility in modelling multivariate distributions, allowing the researcher to specify the models for the marginal distributions separately from the dependence structure (copula) that links them to form a joint distribution. In addition to {\'a}exibility, this often also facilitates estimation of the model in stages, reducing the computational burden. This chapter reviews the growing literature on copula-based models for economic and {\"O}nancial time series data, and discusses in detail methods for estimation, inference, goodness-of-{\"O}t testing, and model selection that are useful when working with these models. A representative data set of two daily equity index returns is used to illustrate all of the main results.},

  abstract = {Since the inception of competitive power markets two decades ago, electricity price forecasting (EPF) has gradually become a fundamental process for energy companies' decision making mechanisms. Over the years, the bulk of research has concerned point predictions. However, the recent introduction of smart grids and renewable integration requirements has had the effect of increasing the uncertainty of future supply, demand and prices. Academics and practitioners alike have come to understand that probabilistic electricity price (and load) forecasting is now more important for energy systems planning and operations than ever before. With this paper we offer a tutorial review of probabilistic EPF and present much needed guidelines for the rigorous use of methods, measures and tests, in line with the paradigm of `maximizing sharpness subject to reliability'. The paper can be treated as an update and a further extension of the otherwise comprehensive EPF review of Weron [1] or as a standalone treatment of a fascinating and underdeveloped topic, that has a much broader reach than EPF itself.},

  abstract = {While electrification has been proposed as a key mechanism for combating global warming, in the US, fossil fuels are still the mainstay of the electricity sector. This work seeks to identify market barriers and supports for the adoption of renewable energy. A framework to represent the evaluation process for generating capacity is proposed and applied to two regions: California (CAISO), where legislation requires most electricity to be supplied by renewables by 2030, and the Mid-Atlantic (PJM), where renewables have barely penetrated the market. Generation technologies are ordered via multiobjective optimization using genetic algorithms to resolve a bounded knapsack problem. Price factors for each technology are established. A net present value is assessed for representative projects in each region and technology. Local sensitivity analysis is performed. Results suggest that capacity payments in PJM offer an incentive to fossil-fuel based plants, which calls into question the suitability of carbon pricing in the region. While solar PV has the lowest costs, profitability was highest for natural gas based plants in PJM. Sensitivity is higher in CAISO than in PJM due to lower profit margins. Renewables were selected most frequently in the cost optimization, with natural gas present in {\textasciitilde}10\% of results.},

  author = {Xu, Chen and Xie, Yao},
  abstract = {We present a new distribution-free conformal prediction algorithm for sequential data (e.g., time series), called the sequential predictive conformal inference (SPCI). We specifically account for the nature that time series data are non-exchangeable, and thus many existing conformal prediction algorithms are not applicable. The main idea is to adaptively re-estimate the conditional quantile of non-conformity scores (e.g., prediction residuals), upon exploiting the temporal dependence among them. More precisely, we cast the problem of conformal prediction interval as predicting the quantile of a future residual, given a userspecified point prediction algorithm. Theoretically, we establish asymptotic valid conditional coverage upon extending consistency analyses in quantile regression. Using simulation and realdata experiments, we demonstrate a significant reduction in interval width of SPCI compared to other existing methods under the desired empirical coverage.},
