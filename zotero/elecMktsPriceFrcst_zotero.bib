  abstract = {Over the years, the growing penetration of renewable energy into the electricity market has resulted in a significant change in the electricity market price. This change makes the existing forecasting method prone to error, decreasing the economic benefits. Hence, more precise forecasting methods need to be developed. This paper starts with a survey and benchmark of existing machine learning approaches for forecasting the real-time market (RTM) price. While these methods provide sufficient modeling capability via supervised learning, their accuracy is still limited due to the single data source, e.g., historical price information only. In this paper, a novel twostage supervised learning approach is proposed by diversifying the data sources such as highly correlated power data. This idea is inspired by the recent load forecasting methods that have shown extremely well performances. Specifically, the proposed two-stage method, namely the rerouted method, learns two types of mapping rules. The first one is the mapping between the historical wind power and the historical price. The second is the forecasting rule for wind generation. Based on the two rules, we forecast the price via the forecasted generation and the first learned mapping between power and price. Additionally, we observed that it is not the more training data the better, leading to our validation steps to quantify the best training intervals for different datasets. We conduct comparisons of numerical results between existing methods and the proposed methods based on datasets from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). For each machine learning step, we examine different learning methods, such as polynomial regression, support vector regression, neural network, and deep neural network. The results show that the proposed method is significantly better than existing approaches when renewables are involved.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a decision-making framework to optimize electricity tariffs and remuneration policy for renewable energy sources operating in transmission- and distribution-level (T\&D) marketplaces. We develop perfect and imperfect foresight models with a multi-level structure to investigate the effects of the inability of actors to correctly predict future remuneration on the efficiency of the decisions made by policymakers. The important advantage of the proposed models is that while they are capturing conflicting interests and different information availability of stakeholders involved, they also account for techno-economic constraints on operations of generation, transmission and distribution assets. The presented models can accommodate net metering, value stack, and distribution locational marginal price (DLMP)-based remuneration policies, which allows for their numerical comparison in terms of the effect on the optimal roll-out of distributed energy resources (DERs). The case study carried out for the NYISO and Manhattan T\&D networks reveals that inaccurate foresight on the DER remuneration diminishes the social welfare under all DER remuneration policies, with the maximum loss of 1.6\% across all considered scenarios.},

We apply the Bayesian method of automatic relevance determination to choose short past windows (short-term history) for the inputs to the MLPs at lower scales and long past windows (long-term history) at higher scales. To form the overall forecast, the individual forecasts are then recombined by the linear reconstruction property of the inverse transform with the chosen autocorrelation shell representation, or by another perceptron which learns the weight of each scale in the prediction of the original time series.

In this paper, we extend the stochastic conditional duration (SCD) model to capture the pattern of intraday trading intervals and propose a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate this intraday seasonality simultaneously. To efficiently generate the Monte Carlo sample, we used a hybrid of the Gibbs/Metropolis–Hastings (MH) sampling scheme and also applied generalized Gibbs sampling. In addition to capturing this intraday seasonality, this paper also considers limit order book information. Three-day tick data for three stocks obtained from Nikkei NEEDS are used for estimation, and model selection is performed on smooth parameters, Weibull distribution and Gamma distribution. The typical intraday regularity of frequent trading immediately after the start of trading is confirmed, and the spread of the limit order book information is also found to affect the trading time interval.},

  abstract = {Since the deregulation of the power markets, accurate short term Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) has become crucial in maximizing economic benefits and mitigating power market risks. Due to the challenging characteristics of electricity price, which comprise high volatility, rapid spike, and seasonality, developing robust machine learning prediction tools becomes cumbersome. This work proposes a new hybrid machine learning method for a day-ahead EPF, which involves linear regression Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) and ensemble bagging Extra Tree Regression (ETR) models. Considering that each model of EPF has its own strengths and weaknesses, combining several models gives more accurate predictions and overcomes the limitations of an individual model. Therefore, the linear ARD model is applied because it can efficiently deal with trend and seasonality variations; on the other hand, the ensemble ETR model is employed to learn from interactions, and thus combining ARD with ETR produces robust forecasting outcomes. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated using a data set from the Nord Pool electricity market. The proposed model is compared with other models to demonstrate its superiority using performance matrices, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves lower forecasting errors than other individual and hybrid models. Additionally, a comparative study has been performed against previous works, where forecasting measurement of the proposed method outperforms previous works’ accuracy in forecasting electricity price.},

It finds there is a meritorder effect from wind and solar PV power at most times of the day, which varies in magnitude for each of the 24 h. Electricity production from wind power is also found to play a clear role in increasing price volatility at all hours. Electricity inflow is shown to decrease both the mean and volatility of the electricity prices. The volatility of electricity prices is revealed to be highly persistent, and thus prone to large transmission shocks. This volatility is also susceptible to new shocks, which may indicate a tendency by market participants to overreact to unexpected shocks in electricity prices, possibly due to the relatively small size of the Iberian electricity market.},

The recalibration methodology is innovative in seeking to perform the recalibration into parametrically defined density functions. The density estimation method selects from a wide diversity of general four-parameter distributions to fit hourly spot prices, in which the first four moments are dynamically estimated as latent functions of the outputs from the fundamental model and several other plausible exogenous drivers.

  abstract = {Abstract Probabilistic forecasts in the form of ensembles of scenarios are required for complex decision-making processes. Ensemble forecasting systems provide such products but the spatiotemporal structures of the forecast uncertainty is lost when statistical calibration of the ensemble forecasts is applied for each lead time and location independently. Nonparametric approaches allow the reconstruction of spatiotemporal joint probability distributions at a small computational cost. For example, the ensemble copula coupling (ECC) method rebuilds the multivariate aspect of the forecast from the original ensemble forecasts. Based on the assumption of error stationarity, parametric methods aim to fully describe the forecast dependence structures. In this study, the concept of ECC is combined with past data statistics in order to account for the autocorrelation of the forecast error. The new approach, called d-ECC, is applied to wind forecasts from the high-resolution Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) ensemble prediction system (EPS) run operationally at the German Weather Service (COSMO-DE-EPS). Scenarios generated by ECC and d-ECC are compared and assessed in the form of time series by means of multivariate verification tools and within a product-oriented framework. Verification results over a 3-month period show that the innovative method d-ECC performs as well as or even outperforms ECC in all investigated aspects.},

We use an optimized parametric policy based on state-of-the-art intraday updates of renewable production forecasts and evaluate the resulting decisions out-of-sample for one year of trading based on detailed order book level data for the German market. Our strategies yield significant positive profits, which suggests that intraday power markets are not semi-strong efficient. Furthermore, sizable additional profits could be made using improved forecasts of renewable output, which implies that the quality of forecasts is an important factor for profitable trading strategies. This has the potential to trigger an arms race for more frequent and more accurate forecasts, which would likely lead to increased market efficiency, more reliable price signals, and more liquidity.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous tabular data are the most commonly used form of data and are essential for numerous critical and computationally demanding applications. On homogeneous data sets, deep neural networks have repeatedly shown excellent performance and have therefore been widely adopted. However, their adaptation to tabular data for inference or data generation tasks remains challenging. To facilitate further progress in the field, this work provides an overview of state-of-the-art deep learning methods for tabular data. We categorize these methods into three groups: data transformations, specialized architectures, and regularization models. For each of these groups, our work offers a comprehensive overview of the main approaches. Moreover, we discuss deep learning approaches for generating tabular data, and we also provide an overview over strategies for explaining deep models on tabular data. Thus, our first contribution is to address the main research streams and existing methodologies in the mentioned areas, while highlighting relevant challenges and open research questions. Our second contribution is to provide an empirical comparison of traditional machine learning methods with eleven deep learning approaches across five popular real-world tabular data sets of different sizes and with different learning objectives. Our results, which we have made publicly available as competitive benchmarks, indicate that algorithms based on gradient-boosted tree ensembles still mostly outperform deep learning models on supervised learning tasks, suggesting that the research progress on competitive deep learning models for tabular data is stagnating. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth overview of deep learning approaches for tabular data; as such, this work can serve as a valuable starting point to guide researchers and practitioners interested in deep learning with tabular data.},

  abstract = {In addition to providing energy to end-consumers, power system operators are also responsible for ensuring system reliability. To this end, power markets maintain an array of ancillary services to ensure it is always possible to balance the supply and demand for energy in real-time. A subset of these ancillary services are commonly procured through market-based mechanisms: namely, Regulation, Spinning, and Non-spinning Reserves.  Regulation Reserves are maintained to respond to supply/demand imbalances over much shorter time frames, typically on the order of one to several seconds. Resources that provide Regulation Reserves adjust their generation or load levels in response to automatic generation control (AGC) signals provided by the system operator.  Operating reserves are maintained to provide additional generation capacity in the event that load increases or other supply side resources reduce their output or are taken offline. The reserves are typically segmented into two categories, 1) Spinning or Synchronized Reserves that are provided by generation units that are actively generating and have the ability to increase or decrease their output, 2) Non-spinning or Non-synchronized Reserves that are provided by generation resources that are not actively generating, but are able to start up and provide generation within a specified timeframe.  Operating reserves typically have response times on the order of ten to 30 minutes and can similarly be provided by supply-side resources that are capable of reducing their load.  There are seven distinct power markets in the United States, each operated by a Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) or Independent System Operator (ISO) that manages transmission infrastructure in its territory, operates markets for energy and ancillary services, and maintains system reliability. Each power market offers its own set of ancillary services, and precise definitions, requirements, and market mechanisms differ between markets.  Despite the differences between markets, both in terms of services offered and system requirements, some broad trends generally apply. Regulation Reserves typically have the highest market prices, followed by Spinning Reserves and Non-spinning Reserves. Prices for Regulation Reserves have been the highest in the PJM market, since it opened in October 2012. This is partially because PJM experienced large price spikes during the period of extreme weather conditions in early 2014. ERCOT has traditionally had the highest prices for Spinning Reserves (called Responsive Reserves in ERCOT), including several periods of sustained high prices between 2010 and 2012. This can be explained in part by the relatively high penetration of variable wind resources and a similarly high requirement relative to peak load.  ERCOT has also traditionally had the highest price for Non-spinning Reserves, followed by the NYISO East region. Both experienced several periods of prolonged high prices since their inception, an occurrence that has not been regularly seen in other markets.  Market size (in terms of capacity) typically follows the reverse order of prices, as systems maintain the most Non-spinning Reserves capacity followed by Spinning Reserves and Regulation Reserves. PJM has the largest market for Regulation Reserves both in terms of revenue and capacity. Total revenue in PJM has grown since the market opened in 2012 due to increased prices. The size of most Regulation Survey of U.S. Ancillary Services Markets Reserves markets in terms of capacity stay relatively constant year-to-year, as this is dictated largely by system requirements. PJM also has the largest Spinning Reserves market in terms of capacity, but due to low prices in 2012 and 2013, total market revenue was relatively small prior to 2014. SPP, MISO, ISO-NE and SPP (beginning in 2014) all have Spinning Reserve markets with similar average capacity levels.  When combined, the markets for Non-spinning and Operating reserves in ISO-NE have a comparable capacity to the market for Primary Reserves in PJM. SPP, MISO, and CAISO all have smaller markets for their respective Non-spinning Reserves products that are roughly the same size as each other in terms of capacity.},

It will be the first approach which is able to combine the insights of market structure models with extensive and modern econometric analysis. Instead of directly modeling the electricity price as it is usually done in time series or data mining approaches, we model and utilize its true source: the sale and purchase curves of the electricity exchange. We will refer to this new model as X-Model, as almost every deregulated electricity price is simply the result of the intersection of the electricity supply and demand curve at a certain auction. Therefore we show an approach to deal with a tremendous amount of auction data, using a subtle data processing technique as well as dimension reduction and lasso based estimation methods. We incorporate not only several known features, such as seasonal behavior or the impact of other processes like renewable energy, but also completely new elaborated stylized  facts of the bidding structure. Our model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of the electricity price, which is especially useful for predicting huge price spikes. Using simulation methods we show how to derive prediction intervals for probabilistic forecasting. We describe and show the proposed methods for the day-ahead EPEX spot price of Germany and Austria.},

  abstract = {In many countries, electricity prices on day-ahead auction markets result from a market clearing designed to maximize social welfare. For each hour of the day, the market price can be represented as the intersection of a supply and demand curve. Structural market models reflect this price formation mechanism and are widely used in prospective studies guiding long-term decisions (e.g. investments and market design). However, simulating the supply curve in these models proves challenging since estimating the sell orders it comprises (i.e. offer prices and corresponding quantities) typically requires formulating numerous techno-economic hypotheses about power system assets and the behaviors of market participants. Due to imperfect competition, real market prices differ from the theoretical optimum, but modeling this difference is not straightforward. The objective of this work is to propose a model to simulate prices on day-ahead markets that account for the optimal economic dispatch of generation units, while also making use of historical day-ahead market prices. Inferring from historical data is especially important when not all information is made public (e.g. bidding strategies) or due to difficulty in accurately accounting for qualitative notions in quantitative models (e.g. market power). In this paper we propose a method for the parametrization of sell orders associated with production units. The estimation algorithm for this parametrization makes it possible to mitigate the requirement for analytic formulation of all of the above-mentioned aspects and to take advantage of the ever-increasing volume of available data on power systems (e.g. technical and market data). Parametrized orders also offer the possibility to account for various factors in a modular fashion, such as the strategic behavior of market participants. The proposed approach is validated using data related to the French day-ahead market and power system, for the period from 2015 to 2018.},

  abstract = {In deregulated electricity markets, accurate modeling and forecasting of different variables, e.g. demand, prices, production etc. have obtained increasing importance in recent years. As in most electricity markets, the daily demand and prices are determined the day before the physical delivery by means of (semi-) hourly concurrent auctions, accurate forecasts are necessary for the efficient management of power systems. However, it is well known that electricity (demand/price) data exhibit some specific features, among which, daily, weekly and annual periodic patterns as well as non-constant mean and variance, jumps and dependency on calendar effects. Modeling and forecasting, thus, is a challenging task. This thesis tackles these two issues, and to do this, two approaches are followed.    In the first case, we address the issue of modeling and out-of-sample forecasting electricity demand and price time series. For this purpose, an additive component model was considered that includes some deterministic and a stochastic residual components. The deterministic components include a long-term dynamics, annual and weekly periodicities and calendar effects. The first three components were estimated using splines while the calendar effects were modeled using dummy variables. The residual component is instead treated as stochastic and different univariate and multivariate models have been considered with increasing level of complexity. In both cases, linear parametric and nonlinear nonparametric models, as well as functional based models, have been estimated and compared in a one day-ahead out-of-sample forecast framework.    The class of univariate models includes parametric autoregressive models (AR), nonparametric and nonlinear regression models based on splines (NPAR) and scalar-response functional models, that in turns can be formulated parametrically (FAR) or non parametrically (NPFAR). The multivariate models are vector autoregressive models (VAR) and functionalresponse, parametric (FFAR) and nonparametric (NPFFAR), models. For this issue, five different electricity markets, namely, British electricity market (APX Power UK), Nord Pool electricity market (NP), Italian electricity market (IPEX), Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland electricity market (PJM) and Portuguese electricity market (OMIE(Po)) were considered for the period 2009 to 2014. The first five years were used for model estimation while the year 2014 was left for one-day-ahead forecasts. Predictive performances are first evaluated by means of descriptive indicators and then through a test to assess the significance of the differences. The analyses suggest that the multivariate approach leads to better results than the univariate one and that, within the multivariate framework, functional models are the most accurate, with VAR being a competitive model in some cases. The results also lead to another important finding concerning to the performance of parametric and nonparametric approach that showed strong linkage with underlying process. Finally the obtained results were compared with other works in the literature that suggest our forecasting errors are smaller compared with the state-of-art prediction techniques used in the literature.    In the second part of this thesis the issue of electricity price forecasting is revisited following a completely different approach. The main idea of this approach is that of modeling the daily supply and demand curves, predicting them and finding the intersection of the predicted curves in order to find the predicted market clearing price and volume. In this approach, the raw bids/offers data for demand and supply, corresponding to each (half-) hour is first aggregated in a specific order. The functional approach converts the resulted piece wise curves into smooth functions. For this issue, parametric functional model (FFAR) and the nonlinear nonparametric counterpart (NPFFAR) were considered. As benchmark, an ARIMA model was fitted to the scalar time series corresponding to the market clearing prices obtained from the crossing points of supply and demand curves. Data from Italian electricity market were used for this issue and the results are summarized by different descriptive indicators. As in the first case, results show superior forecasting performance of our functional approach compare to ARIMA. Among different models, the nonparametric functional model produces better results compared to parametric models. Apart from the improvement in forecasting accuracy, it is important to stress that this approach can be used for optimizing bidding strategies. As forecasting the whole curves gives deep insight into the market, our analysis showed that this strategy can significantly improve bidding strategies and maximize traders profit.},

The key feature of the X-model is that it makes a day-ahead forecast for the entire wholesale supply and demand curves. The intersection of the predicted curves yields the forecast for equilibrium day-ahead prices and volumes. We take advantage of a technique for auction curves’ transformation to improve the original X-model. Instead of using actual wholesale supply and demand curves, we rely on transformed versions of these curves with perfectly inelastic demand. As a result, the computational requirements of our X-model are reduced and its forecasting power increases. Moreover, our X-model is more robust towards outliers present in the initial auction curves’ data.

We present two stochastic variants of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the hyperparameters of the proposed model. Both variants of EM employ S-MCMC in their expectation steps. We apply the proposed framework to the Turkish electricity market and show its performance on a real dataset from that market.},

The Fault Level Rule sought to ensure that adequate sources of system strength would remain available (or  be made available) to assist in the management of power system security and enable the secure operation of  IBR.  There are two parallel mechanisms in the NER to achieve this outcome:  minimum three-phase fault  levels to be maintained by transmission network service providers (TNSPs) for the power system to be in a  secure operating state, and obligations on connection applicants (primarily Generators) to remediate adverse  system strength impacts resulting from their connection (or alteration).  System strength is generally not well understood.  This document seeks to address some common  misunderstandings by presenting AEMO’s views on:  • The meaning of system strength.  • The importance of system strength.  • Relationship between system strength and other power system stability phenomena.  • Assessing system strength.  • Impact on system strength from new connections, and the application of system strength remediation.  • System strength from a planning perspective},

  abstract = {Modern power systems are giant, multi-faceted machines. To operate the  complex ‘system of systems’ in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM),  AEMO oversees in aggregate millions of separate electricity supply and demand  decisions in real time, all day, every day.   The NEM, like power systems worldwide, is being transformed from a system dominated by large thermal  power stations, to a system including a multitude of power generation resources and technologies of various  sizes 1,2. At the same time, customers are engaging with their electricity supply in new ways.   The energy transformation involves a shift from:  • Firm to variable energy sources.  • Synchronous to inverter-based resource (IBR) generation.  • A centralised to a decentralised system.  • Passive to active consumers.  AEMO’s challenge is to continually meet the needs of the power system, in the  face of major structural changes and the resulting uncertainty across investment and operational timeframes.   While the power system is being transformed, the laws of physics that determine electrical flows do not  change. To maintain a secure and reliable system, a range of interdependent technical and operational needs  must be met at all times.   Physically, the NEM operates on one of the world’s longest interconnected power systems, stretching from  Port Douglas in Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia and across the Bass Strait to Tasmania – a  distance of around 5,000 kilometres. By international standards, the NEM is unusually long and sparse, which  affects power system dynamics.  Interactions in any power system are highly complex and dynamic. Operating a power system involves a  continuum of decisions. AEMO needs to know what is happening in real time, and anticipate what is likely to  happen in the coming seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, years, even decades.

Grid forming inverters (GFI) control the flow of RES into grid, and help with blackstart, mimicking large power plants. ~They can inject voltage to help adjust frequency, and have been used for years in isolated grids. ~Most RES is connected only with grid-following inverter, which (AFIK from this article) follow the AC waveform, at whatever frequency it happens to be. ~GFI is not “necessarily more expensive” so recommendation to just always use them.
\par
Australia may be the world leader in large RES grid-forming inverters. ~In 2023, 3 already existed, with 3 “in the works”, for a total of 480 MW. ~A couple are for S AUS wind plants, and 8 more RES/grid-forming projects are planned (2 GW more, 10X current GFI capacity).

  abstract = {{$<$}abstract{$><$}p{$>$}Energy consumption increases daily across the world. Electricity is the best means that humankind has found for transmitting energy. This can be said regardless of its origin. Energy transmission is crucial for ensuring the efficient and reliable distribution of electricity from power generation sources to end-users. It forms the backbone of modern societies, supporting various sectors such as residential, commercial, and industrial activities. Energy transmission is a fundamental enabler of well-functioning and competitive electricity markets, supporting reliable supply, market integration, price stability, and the integration of renewable energy sources. Electric energy sourced from various regions worldwide is routinely traded within these electricity markets on a daily basis. This paper presents a review of forecasting techniques for intraday electricity markets prices, volumes, and price volatility. Electricity markets operate in a sequential manner, encompassing distinct components such as the day-ahead, intraday, and balancing markets. The intraday market is closely linked to the timely delivery of electricity, as it facilitates the trading and adjustment of electricity supply and demand on the same day of delivery to ensure a balanced and reliable power grid. Accurate forecasts are essential for traders to maximize profits within intraday markets, making forecasting a critical concern in electricity market management. In this review, statistical and econometric approaches, involving various machine learning and ensemble/hybrid techniques, are presented. Overall, the literature highlights the superiority of machine learning and ensemble/hybrid models over statistical models.{$<$}/p{$><$}/abstract{$>$}},

The MO combines these with demand forecasts to produce equilibrium prices and instructs firms on their dispatch. We incorporate the possibility that generating firms may rebid (or revise) their supply schedule prior to dispatch - an important feature of markets in many countries which has not previously been included in theoretical models. We show that a dominant firm can gain substantially by manipulating its bids, and take advantage of the opportunity to submit rebids. In the Australian National Energy Market (NEM) where settlement prices are an average of six dispatch prices, it can, for example, withhold capacity at lower prices for the first bid in a period, creating a price hike, and then add capacity at lower prices to ensure dispatch. Using data from the Australian NEM we provide the first empirical evidence consistent with the hypothesized theoretical behaviour in the observed data.},

  abstract = {The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is undergoing rapid change as utility-scale wind, solar and now battery storage technologies enter the market. The impact of these changes on the operation of the NEM is of interest to a potentially wide range of stakeholders including researchers, market participants, consultants and energy NGOs. Detailed operational data is essential in assisting these stakeholders to understand these impacts and possible future outcomes in the NEM. Open data and open-source software for energy are increasingly seen as key to improving transparency and reproducibility, and therefore productive discussion on energy policy and market reform amongst a wide range of stakeholders. There is an excellent opportunity to further these aims in the NEM, due to high levels of transparency around market data, with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) releasing nearly all the data used in the central dispatch process. However, a significant processing and interpretation overhead exists when analysing the large and often complex datasets made available to the public. This paper reports on a new open-source software tool, NEMOSIS NEM Open Source Information Service, NEMOSIS, which aims to lower this overhead and improve the accessibility of data sourced from AEMO. While a number of similar proprietary tools exist and are widely used by industry stakeholders, NEMOSIS offers additional benefits. It is completely open to modification and extension with the source code available on GitHub, while also being highly portable with the ability to package the tool as an executable file and operate it via a graphical user interface. It complements some other open source data tools for the NEM by providing access to a wide selection of data without the need for the user to have any coding knowledge. To demonstrate the use of NEMOSIS, this paper presents two examples of how it can be used to assess utility-scale renewable generator performance; firstly, with a simple example that outlines how to access 5 minute dispatch data for all scheduled generators in the NEM, and then, a second more complex example explains the implementation of a custom data table of plant performance statistics.},

  abstract = {The recent introduction of five-minute settlements into the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) in October 2021 saw a massive increase in the number of offers submitted to the market at every five-minute Dispatch Interval. While many of these offers were from non-renewable generators, a significant proportion was now from Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) Generators that had rarely submitted offers to the market before the market change. VRE generators use various approaches to actively manage their market risks, including internal and external multi-generator operations centres, advanced Machine Learning optimisers and simple single generator revenue optimisers. This paper will discuss the advantages and risks of all three approaches, how each has operated in the market, and how strategies adapt to the dynamic competitive energy and ancillary markets. Surprisingly, the simple and usually lower-cost option of a simple revenue optimisation seems to provide a low-risk, reliable and robust alternative for VRE generators and can also be combined with other systems to meet VRE compliance and other operational priorities generators. More sophisticated systems are required for multi-modal and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) as the forecast horizon needs to consider an entire trading day operations due to the physical constraints of the Lithium-Ion technology. However, the same revenue optimisation approach can work for other battery technologies, such as supercapacitors, that do not have the cycle constraints of Lithium-Ion and are especially suited to providing frequency and contingency ancillary services.},

  abstract = {VPPs (Virtual Power Plants) play an important role in balancing supply and demand. In order to make VPP revenue, it is necessary to forecast market prices and bidding energy for supply and demand adjustment markets, called FCAS (Frequency Control Ancillary Service) markets. However, price forecasting for FCAS markets is still challenging because they have multiple different response times and one price, directly and indirectly, influences each other. There is no study on electricity price forecasting in FCAS markets, and a novel forecasting model considering not only its price but also the other prices of the different response times is necessary. This work presents a market price forecasting model for a FCAS market by exploring the forecasting models derived from a wholesale market, and then it takes into account the markets with different response times as well as the target one from AEMO (Australian Energy Market Operator). Through the experiments, our forecasting model achieves 7.8\$/MWh of RMSE on the electricity price in AEMO’s 6-Second-Raise market. The proposed forecasting model reduces RMSE by 80\% compared to the forecast price published by AEMO.},

  abstract = {Electricity is a commodity, which has many different attributes from other products because of its unique features. It needs a special infrastructure for production, transportation, and consumption.  In this thesis, the electricity system is discussed in two subsystems. The flow of electricity happens in the technical subsystem, and monetary value is discussed in the economic subsystem.     Here is an attempt to do a comprehensive review of three different marketplaces: AEMO in Australia, CAISO in California, and Nord Pool in Nordic countries based on literature review and available public information. In these marketplaces, there is continuous or upcoming reform of the energy system, which can be strengthened by integrating different perspectives from current markets. Characteristics for a successful electricity market are also proposed at the end of the thesis.     Currently, CAISO has a centralized wholesale energy market, while Nord Pool and AEMO have also decentralized properties. The critical issue with the centralized CAISO market is that they don’t have intra-day pricing that can be updated continuously when the renewable generation changes. Whereas Nord Pool and AEMO with their decentralized intraday market, has the flexibility to adjust the price according to renewable energy production as close to real-time. This iterative intra-day trading can address the coordination problem related to wind and solar power generation. The downside is that there is a risk of network constrain, which can be improved by analysing the network in more detail.     The limitation of this study is using only three marketplaces where in the future it can be extended to more marketplaces},

This paper's aim is to answer the degree of how deep learning can contribute to forecasting prices thresholds in a volatile real-time electricity price market. Additional research in this area is required post NEM transition to a unified 5 minute dispatch and bidding cycle. Effective short term forecasting can enable the transition from manual to automatic bidding fully optimising the revenue potential for generators. The algorithms presented in this paper present an ultra-short horizon prediction forecasting of 15 minutes into the future. The Queensland wholesale electricity market price is used to present the research findings. Our results show deep learning models can achieve significant performance gains.},

Within our ensemble framework, we demonstrate that averaging models with varying training-length periods leads to a more adaptive model and increased prediction accuracy. The applicability of the final model is evaluated by comparing our median forecasts with the point forecasts available from the Australian NEM operator, with our model outperforming these NEM forecasts by a significant margin.},

  abstract = {The accurate prediction of electricity prices has great significance for the power system and the electricity market, regional electricity prices are difficult to predict due to congestion issues in regional transmission lines. A regional electricity price prediction framework is proposed based on an adaptive spatial–temporal convolutional network. The proposed framework is expected to better explore regional electricity prices’ spatial–temporal dynamic characteristics in the electricity spot market and improve the predictive accuracy of regional electricity prices. First, different areas of the electricity market are regarded as nodes. Then, each area’s historical electricity price data are used as the corresponding node’s characteristic information and constructed into a graph. Finally, a graph containing the spatial–temporal information on electricity prices is input to the adaptive spatial–temporal prediction framework to predict the regional electricity price. Operational data from the Australian electricity market are adopted, and the prediction results from the proposed adaptive spatial–temporal prediction framework are compared with those of existing methods. The numerical example results show that the predictive accuracy of the proposed framework is better than the existing baseline and similar methods. In the twelve-step forecast example in this paper, considering the spatial dependence of the spot electricity price can improve the forecast accuracy by at least 10.3\% and up to 19.8\%.},

We apply this analytical method to the wholesale Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland (PJM) electricity market. We find that according to PCA, in the individual transmission lines, spike prices are determinants with largest explanatory power to the variation of prices, while according to NARDL, from the standpoint of the overall market, negative prices have a larger potential effect on both the real-time market and the forward market.

  abstract = {Electricity is traded on various markets with different time horizons and regulations. Short-term intraday trading becomes increasingly important due to the higher penetration of renewables. In Germany, the intraday electricity price typically fluctuates around the day-ahead price of the European Power EXchange (EPEX) spot markets in a distinct hourly pattern. This work proposes a probabilistic modeling approach that models the intraday price difference to the day-ahead contracts. The model captures the emerging hourly pattern by considering the four 15min intervals in each day-ahead price interval as a four-dimensional joint probability distribution. The resulting nontrivial, multivariate price difference distribution is learned using a normalizing flow, i.e., a deep generative model that combines conditional multivariate density estimation and probabilistic regression. Furthermore, this work discusses the influence of different external impact factors based on literature insights and impact analysis using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The normalizing flow is compared to an informed selection of historical data and probabilistic forecasts using a Gaussian copula and a Gaussian regression model. Among the different models, the normalizing flow identifies the trends with the highest accuracy and has the narrowest prediction intervals. Both the XAI analysis and the empirical experiments highlight that the immediate history of the price difference realization and the increments of the day-ahead price have the most substantial impact on the price difference.},

However, DL models are often quite sensitive to the used input normalization method, requiring extensive experimentation and fine-tuning to identify and apply the most appropriate method for different tasks. Even though trainable adaptive normalization methods have been recently proposed to overcome this to a certain extend, these methods also tend to remove useful information from the data, ignoring the global statistics of the input time series. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we propose a trainable adaptive normalization approach that is capable of both maintaining important mode information, since global statistics are employed for the normalization, as well as taking into account the current behavior of the time series and adjusting the normalization scheme to this. The effectiveness of the proposed method over baseline and state-of the-art normalization methods is demonstrated using extensive experiments on two different electric load forecasting datasets.},

  abstract = {Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we report some insightful findings to deeply analyze and understand our proposed SAN. We make our codes publicly available2.},

  abstract = {The study of Day-Ahead prices in the electricity market is one of the most popular problems in time series forecasting. Previous research has focused on employing increasingly complex learning algorithms to capture the sophisticated dynamics of the market. However, there is a threshold where increased complexity fails to yield substantial improvements. In this work, we propose an alternative approach by introducing an adaptive standardisation to mitigate the effects of dataset shifts that commonly occur in the market. By doing so, learning algorithms can prioritize uncovering the true relationship between the target variable and the explanatory variables. We investigate four distinct markets, including two novel datasets, previously unexplored in the literature. These datasets provide a more realistic representation of the current market context, that conventional datasets do not show. The results demonstrate a significant improvement across all four markets, using learning algorithms that are less complex yet widely accepted in the literature. This significant advancement unveils opens up new lines of research in this field, highlighting the potential of adaptive transformations in enhancing the performance of forecasting models.},

  abstract = {Data normalization is a fundamental preprocessing step for mining and learning from data. However, finding an appropriated method to deal with time series normalization is not a simple task. This is because most of the traditional normalization methods make assumptions that do not hold for most time series. The first assumption is that all time series are stationary, i.e., their statistical properties, such as mean and standard deviation, do not change over time. The second assumption is that the volatility of the time series is considered uniform. None of the methods currently available in the literature address these issues. This paper proposes a new method for normalizing non-stationary heteroscedastic (with non-uniform volatility) time series. The method, named Adaptive Normalization (AN), was tested together with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in three forecast problems. The results were compared to other four traditional normalization methods, and showed AN improves ANN accuracy in both short- and long-term predictions.},

Sliding min/max normalization but the min/max values used in normalization come from a lookup table, which matches some kind of summary statistics measured sometime recently, I think, e.g. mean/std. ~Also, min/max are quantiles, not literal min/max.
\par
Seems like you couldn’t look too far back e.g. inflation would have shifted prices in the future and those old min/max values would be wrong. ~So, wouldn’t you need to normalize those too?

  abstract = {Tree-based models have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks, including time series forecasting. They are increasingly in demand and widely accepted because of their comparatively high level of interpretability. However, many of them suffer from the overfitting problem, which limits their application in real-world decision-making. This problem becomes even more severe in online-forecasting settings where time series observations are incrementally acquired, and the distributions from which they are drawn may keep changing over time. In this context, we propose a novel method for the online selection of tree-based models using the TreeSHAP explainability method in the task of time series forecasting. We start with an arbitrary set of different tree-based models. Then, we outline a performance-based ranking with a coherent design to make TreeSHAP able to specialize the tree-based forecasters across different regions in the input time series. In this framework, adequate model selection is performed online, adaptively following drift detection in the time series. In addition, explainability is supported on three levels, namely online input importance, model selection, and model output explanation. An extensive empirical study on various real-world datasets demonstrates that our method achieves excellent or on-par results in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches as well as several baselines.},

Instead of adapting forecasting model inputs, use TreeSHAP to select from the most appropriate model, maybe spawn new models too.

Thus, developing more accurate price modeling and forecasting techniques is a challenge for all market participants and regulatory authorities. This paper proposes a forecasting approach based on using auction data to fit supply and demand electricity curves. More specifically, we fit linear (LinX-Model) and logistic (LogX-Model) curves to historical sale and purchase bidding data from the Iberian electricity market to estimate structural parameters from 2015 to 2019. Then we use time series models on structural parameters to predict day-ahead prices. Our results provide a solid framework for forecasting electricity prices by capturing the structural characteristics of markets.},

  abstract = {The increased uptake of variable renewable energy sources has increased electricity price volatility in many energy pool markets, providing an opportunity for storage systems to profit through energy arbitrage. Comparison between the cost or value of storage systems engaging in energy arbitrage should be performed on a levelised basis due to differences in system lifetime. Existing energy arbitrage models with bid/offer curves and imperfect forecasting are typically computationally expensive and are impractical for calculating lifetime levelised cost metrics. In this work, an open-source modular energy arbitrage model with bid and offer curve inputs was developed for a lithium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS) and pumped hydro system (PHS) to analyse lifetime levelised cost and revenue. The mixed integer linear program scheduling module included a new piece-wise linearised description of PHS charging behaviour for rapid optimisation. A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis indicated that levelised cost and revenue were highly sensitive to discharging efficiency. In a case study based on Australia’s National Electricity Market, imperfect forecasting with no risk hedging was found to increase levelised costs by up to 24\% and decrease levelised revenue by up to 50\% relative to perfect price forecasting, despite 95\% of prices being forecast to be within \$35/MWh of the actual trading price. BESS levelised costs were more significantly correlated with consistent low risk bids (Kendall Tau-b of 0.75), since the undiscounted capital costs contribute to a larger proportion of the overall costs than in the PHS systems.},

The 2021 move to 5 minute trading intervals probably made prices less temporally independent within 30 minute intervals, and removed a lot of very short oscillating price spikes.
\par
\textbf{Before Oct. 1 2021}
\par
The dispatch was @ 5 mins and trading interval was @ 30 min (averge of 6 dispatch intervals). ~The averaging made it possible to know the minimum trading price until the interval’s end; if one dispatch period was very high, then even assuming the the rest of the interval was at the market minimu allowed, the trading price would still be gauranteed high, so tons of traders jumped in and the dispatch price shot down. ~The result was an often rapidly oscillating price, sometimes from near the market cap, to negative. ~Still for physical incidents (floods and fires) dispatch prices were more stable (remain high) at high prices.

\item Dispatch price and market price cover the same interval (les temporal dependence)

Weather-dependent renewable production and the difference between exports and imports appear as control variables in the model. The empirical analysis was based on data from 2017 and 2018. The results show that the control variables have no effect on the bid-ask spread and that the model explains 96 per cent of the spikes well, with an AUC-ROC of 0.75 and a Gini coefficient of 0.5.

First, on the “vertical” dimension, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models are stacked up to produce supplementary price forecasts. The final forecasts are then picked depending on how the predictions compare to a price spike threshold. On the “horizontal” dimension, five models are designed to extend the forecasting horizon to four days. This is an important requirement to make forecasts useful for market participants who trade energy and ancillary services multiple days ahead. The horizontally cascaded models take advantage of the availability of specific public data for each forecasting horizon. To enhance the forecasting capability of the model in dealing with price spikes, we deploy a previously unexplored input in the proposed methodology. That is, to use the recent variations in the output power of thermal units as an indicator of unplanned outages or shift in the supply stack. The proposed method is tested using data from Alberta’s electricity market, which is known for its volatility and price spikes. An economic application of the developed forecasting model is also carried out to demonstrate how several market players in the Alberta electricity market can benefit from the proposed multi-day ahead price forecasting model. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is effective in enhancing forecasting accuracy and price spike detection.},

We introduce a novel approach to normalize time series data conditional on a set of covariates. We do this by modeling the conditional mean and the conditional variance of the time series with generalized additive models using a set of covariates. The conditional mean and variance are then used to normalize the time series. We illustrate the use of conditionally normalized series using two applications involving river network data. First, we show how these normalized time series can be used to impute missing values in the data. Second, we show how the normalized series can be used to estimate the conditional autocorrelation function and conditional cross-correlation functions via additive models. Finally we use the conditional cross-correlations to estimate the time it takes water to flow between two locations in a river network.},

We compare the performance of this approach to standard autoregression methods and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of model prediction error. In addition, we use deep neural networks (DNN) and random forest (RF) to further test the proposed approach’s performance compared to standard approaches using raw LOB data. The findings show that Sig-DNN, DNN with signature features, outperforms DNN with raw LOB data in terms of prediction error and efficiency, while Sig-RF, RF with signature features, underperformed RF with raw LOB data in terms of prediction but not in efficiency. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple exchanges, including the Johannesburg and New York Stock Exchanges, and the results demonstrate better prediction error and efficiency performance in developed markets compared to emerging markets.

Though in this sense generative market simulation is model-free, the concrete modelling choices are nevertheless decisive for the features of the simulated paths. We give a brief overview of currently used generative modelling approaches and performance evaluation metrics for financial time series, and address some of the challenges to achieve good results in the latter. We also contrast some classical approaches of market simulation with simulation based on generative modelling and highlight some advantages and pitfalls of the new approach. While most generative models tend to rely on large amounts of training data, we present here a generative model that works reliably in environments where the amount of available training data is notoriously small. Furthermore, we show how a rough paths perspective combined with a parsimonious Variational Autoencoder framework provides a powerful way for encoding and evaluating financial time series in such environments where available training data is scarce. Finally, we also propose a suitable performance evaluation metric for financial time series and discuss some connections of our Market Generator to deep hedging.},

  abstract = {This thesis deals with the development of new mathematical models that support the decision-making processes of market players. It addresses the problems of demand-side bidding, price-responsive load forecasting and reserve determination.  From a methodological point of view, we investigate a novel approach to model the response of aggregate price-responsive load as a constrained optimization model, whose parameters are estimated from data by using inverse optimization techniques.The problems tackled in this dissertation are motivated, on one hand, by the increasing penetration of renewable energy production and smart grid technologies in power systems, that is expected to continue growing in the coming years.  Non-dispatchable electricity generation cannot ensure a certain production at all times, since it depends on meteorological factors. Also, smart grid technologies are affecting the consumption patterns that the load traditionally exhibited. On the other hand, this thesis is motivated by the decision-making processes of market players. In response to these challenges, this thesis provides mathematical models for decision-making under uncertainty in electricity markets.  Demand-side bidding refers to the participation of consumers, often through a retailer, in energy trading. Under the smart-grid paradigm, the demand bids must reflect the elasticity of the consumers to changes in electricity price. Traditional forecasting models are typically not able to reflect this elasticity, hence we propose two novel approaches to estimate market bids. Both approaches are data-driven and take into account the uncertainty of future factors, as, for example, price. In both cases, demand-side bids that comprise a price-energy term decrease the expected imbalances and also increase the profit of retailers participating in electricity markets.In the field of load forecasting, this thesis provides a novel approach to model time series and forecast loads under the real-time pricing setup. The relationship between price and aggregate response of the load is characterized by an optimization problem, which is shaped by a set of unknown parameters. Such parameters are estimated from data by using an inverse optimization framework.  The usability of the proposed method is studied and we conclude that inverseoptimization-based modeling is a computationally attractive method that outperforms the forecasting capabilities of traditional time series models.  Regarding the reserve determination, the special characteristics of the Danish power system do not allow for co-optimizing the unit commitment and reserve requirements. Hence, we propose a probabilistic framework, where the reserve requirements are computed based on scenarios of wind power and load forecast errors and power plant outages. The solution of the stochastic optimization models increases the safety of the overall system while decreases the associated reserve costs, with respect to the method currently used by the Danish TSO.},

We utilize a transformer-based model for real-time price prediction, which captures complex dynamical patterns of real-time prices, and use the result for day-ahead bidding design. For real-time bidding, we utilize a long short-term memory-dynamic programming hybrid real-time bidding model. We train and test our model with historical data from New York State, and our results showed that the integrated system achieved promising results of almost a 20\textbackslash\% increase in profit compared to only bidding in real-time markets, and at the same time reducing the risk in terms of the number of days with negative profits.},

  abstract = {Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) has sparked interest in the electricity price forecasting community after its unprecedented success in the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, where the top two winning teams in the price track used variants of QRA. However, recent studies have reported the method's vulnerability to low quality predictors when the set of regressors is larger than just a few. To address this issue, we consider a regularized variant of QRA, which utilizes the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to automatically select the relevant regressors. We evaluate the introduced technique – dubbed LASSO QRA or LQRA for short – using datasets from the Polish and Nordic power markets. By comparing against a number of benchmarks, we provide evidence for its superior predictive performance in terms of the Kupiec test, the pinball score and the test for conditional predictive accuracy, as well as financial profits for a range of trading strategies, especially when the regularization parameter is selected ex-ante using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). As such, we offer an efficient tool that can be used to boost the profitability of energy trading activities, help with bidding in day-ahead markets and improve risk management practices in the power sector.},

EPF has attracted enormous interest from both practitioners and scholars since the deregulation of the power market and wide applications of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar energy. However, forecasting the electricity price accurately and efficiently is an extremely challenging task because of its high volatility, randomness, and fluctuation. Although quantile regression averaging (QRA) has been demonstrated to be efficacious in probabilistic EPF since the global energy forecasting competition in 2014 (GEFCom2014), it is sensitive to nuisance variables especially when the number of variables is large. The forecasting accuracy will be negatively affected by these nuisance variables. To address these challenges, this study investigates a nonconvex regularized QRA in probabilistic forecasting. Two types of nonconvex regularized QRA select the important inputs obtained from point forecasting to obtain more accurate forecasting outcomes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EPF model, two real datasets from the European power market are considered.},

  abstract = {Electricity price forecasting (EPF) plays a major role for electricity companies as a fundamental entry for trading decisions or energy management operations. As electricity can not be stored, electricity prices are highly volatile which make EPF a particularly difficult task. This is all the more true when dramatic fortuitous events disrupt the markets. Trading and more generally energy management decisions require risk management tools which are based on probabilistic EPF (PEPF). In this challenging context, we argue in favor of the deployment of highly adaptive black-boxes strategies allowing to turn any forecasts into a robust adaptive predictive interval, such as conformal prediction and online aggregation, as a fundamental last layer of any operational pipeline. We propose to investigate a novel data set containing the French electricity spot prices during the turbulent 2020-2021 years, and build a new explanatory feature revealing high predictive power, namely the nuclear availability. Benchmarking state-of-the-art PEPF on this data set highlights the difficulty of choosing a given model, as they all behave very differently in practice, and none of them is reliable. However, we propose an adequate conformalisation, OSSCP-horizon, that improves the performances of PEPF methods, even in the most hazardous period of late 2021. Finally, we emphasize that combining it with online aggregation significantly outperforms any other approaches, and should be the preferred pipeline, as it provides trustworthy probabilistic forecasts.},

Neural networks can naturally incorporate additional structure in the data. We develop a recurrent version of EQRN that is able to capture complex sequential dependence in time series. We apply this method to forecast flood risk in the Swiss Aare catchment. It exploits information from multiple covariates in space and time to provide one-day-ahead predictions of return levels and exceedance probabilities. This output complements the static return level from a traditional extreme value analysis, and the predictions are able to adapt to distributional shifts as experienced in a changing climate.

There are additional crucial characteristics: the intervals must vary in length, with this variation directly linked to the difficulty of the prediction, and the coverage of the interval must remain independent of the difficulty of the prediction for practical utility. We propose the Heteroscedastic Quantile Regression (HQR) model and the Width-Adaptive Conformal Inference (WACI) method, providing theoretical coverage guarantees, to overcome those issues, respectively. The methodologies are evaluated in the context of Electricity Price Forecasting and Wind Power Forecasting, representing complex scenarios in time series forecasting.
