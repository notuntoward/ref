  abstract = {Battery degradation is the main uncertainty that  hedges the development of battery projects. In this work, we  build a data-driven battery degradation model assessing the  impact of the complex state of charge (SOC) operation  condition. Both cycle life and calendar life are incorporated,  based on the available lab testing data of battery cells. Various  degradation modeling functions are compared to acquire the  best fitting results under different depths of discharge (DOD)  ranges calculated by rainflow counting algorithm. The  statistical relation between shallow cycles and calendar time is  used to address the calendar degradation in the cycling scope. A  battery frequency regulation service case study is carried out  based on a one-year frequency record in the Nordic synchronous  area. Our work bridges the battery cell testing datasets to the  battery degradation modeling in grid applications and proposes  a new perspective to address the calendar life by the analysis of  the shallow cycles for the state of health (SOH) estimation,  which improves applicability and accuracy.

  abstract = {The unpredictability of battery degradation behavior is a challenging issue impeding the development of battery  applications, due to the complexity of the degradation and the limitation of state measurement methods.  Nowadays, with accessible battery aging datasets and machine learning algorithms, there are opportunities for  data-driven battery health prognosis. However, most of the previous work is restricted in the scope of full-  discharge capacity records extrapolation, which has insufficient prospects in real-life applications. In this  work, we propose using partial discharge information for degradation estimation and prediction. Our Gaussian  process regression model achieves good performance by limited partial discharge information without re- quirements of feature selection. The accurate battery health prognosis in 300 cycles can be carried out by one  partial-discharge cycle at any degradation stage. The capacity estimation gives around 1 \% root mean square  error (RMSE) when using 30 \% information on the discharge process. As full-cycle discharge is not required, the  proposed model can diagnose the battery state of health (SOH) with a limited portion of battery operation in- formation extracted during the discharge process and reduce the effort of capacity tests. Further development of  this method brings opportunities for battery state evaluation and prediction in real applications with better  applicability and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) has a fast response time and high ramping capability, making it suitable for smart grid frequency regulation service. However, providing the required regulation capacity without a problem at any point in time is bound with the BESS state of charge (SOC) development periodically. Moreover, knowing SOC variation in advance will help the BESS producers keep SOC at the desired level. The BESS SOC can be maintained in the admissible operation area to avoid the mismatch penalties while following regulation signals. Therefore, the maximum service reward can also be achieved. Unfortunately, forecasting the SOC of BESS in frequency regulation service is not a straightforward problem. The forecasting method should deal with multiple dependent variables that periodically determine SOC’s development. Moreover, developing a one-time manner multistep SOC forecasting model is also a challenge. To solve both problems, a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) regression learning architecture that has been proven to deal with sequentially interdependent data is adopted in our proposed forecasting framework. Various state-of-the-art memory cells in deep regression learning, i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), bi-directional (bi)-LSTM, and bi-GRU, were utilized and evaluated. The evaluation result shows that the developed models outperform the existing machine learning-based forecasting methods. The Bi-GRU cells provide the best performance in root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) evaluation metrics.},

In this paper, the degradation mechanism and main definitions of state of health (SOH) were described by summarizing domestic and foreign literatures. The estimation and prediction methods of lithium-ion power battery SOH were discussed from three aspects: model-based methods, data-driven methods, and fusion technology methods. This review summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the current mainstream SOH estimation and prediction methods. This paper believes that more innovative feature parameter extraction methods, multi-algorithm coupling, com- bined with cloud platform and other technologies will be the development trend of SOH estimation and prediction in the future, which provides a reference for health state estimation and prediction of lithium-ion power battery.

As the main  energy storage device, lithium-ion batteries are one of the  key components that need to be properly managed. The  remaining useful life, which represents battery health, has  attracted increasing attention. Because accurate and  robust predictions provide important information for  predictive maintenance and cascade utilization. This paper  proposes a novel method to predict remaining useful life  based on the optimized health indicators and online model  correction with transfer learning. Gaussian process  regression is used to optimize the threshold for health  indicators to determine the end of life, and a usefulness  evaluation strategy is proposed to assess the health  indicators. Then, a combination of transfer learning and  gated recurrent neural network is designed to predict the  remaining useful life based on the optimized health  indicators directly, which can promote online applications.  The prediction model initially trained based on a relevant  battery is further fine-tuned according to the early  degradation cycling data of the test battery to provide  accurate predictions. Moreover, a self-correction strategy  is proposed to retrain the regression models so that the  models can gradually reach the optimal prediction  performance during the operating cycles, which could not  be achieved by traditional methods. The recommended  input sequence lengths for potential applications are  discussed. The method is verified by experiments of a  batch of batteries under fast charging conditions, and the  results show that, after fine-tuning, the proposed method  predicts remaining useful life with an error of fewer than 5  cycles.},

SOH estimation based on machine learning has attracted great  attention in recent years, and holds potentials for battery  informatization and cloud battery management techniques. In this  paper, a comprehensive study of the data-driven SOH estimation  methods is conducted. A new classification for health indicators  (HIs) is proposed where the HIs are divided into the measured  variables and calculated variables. To illustrate the significance of  data preprocessing, four noise reduction methods are assessed in  the HIs extraction process; different feature selection methods,  including filter-based method, wrapper-based method, and fusion- based method, are applied to select HIs subsets. The four widely  used machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural  network, support vector machine, relevance vector machine, and  Gaussian process regression, are applied and compared. In order  to evaluate the estimation performance in potential real usages  under future big data era, the three HIs selection methods and four  machine learning methods are evaluated using three public data  sets and two estimation strategies. The results show that the  combination of the fusion-based selection method and Gaussian  process regression has an overall superior estimation performance  in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are considered as promising electric energy storage systems. However, identification of battery health is a critical issue. Furthermore, battery aging extremely depends on operating conditions. Therefore, monitoring and analysis of battery health degradation in real-time systems such as electric vehicles, in which a variety of stress factors may come into play, are demanded. This paper proposes a data-driven algorithm based on multiple condition indicator to estimate battery health using application-based load profiles. In this regard, battery cells have been cycled under a worldwide light duty driving test cycle (WLTC) load profile in laboratory to acquire real-world driving data. Time-domain and frequency-domain condition indicators are extracted from measured on-board data like voltage and current within certain time intervals, enabling real-time investigation of battery health degradation. The condition indicators have been fed into a Gaussian process estimator to track the real-time state of health (SoH). As degradation strongly depends on magnitude of input current, it is important that the proposed method can predict health of the cell regardless of current amplitude and aging pattern. Therefore, to assess accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, it is validated using a different load profile with distinct depth of discharge, current amplitude, and distinctive aging pattern. Results reveal the proposed approach is highly precise and is capable of estimating battery SoH with low computational costs and a relative error of less than 1\%. The proposed technique is promising for online diagnostics of battery health thanks to its high accuracy and robustness.},

Battery development capabilities are provided by communities spanning materials discovery, battery chemistry and electrochemistry, cell and pack design, scale-up, manufacturing, and deployments. Despite their relative maturity, data-science practices among these diverse groups are far behind the state of the art in other fields, which have demonstrated an abil- ity to significantly improve innovation and economic impact. The negative consequences of the present paradigm include incremen- tal improvements but few breakthroughs, significant manufacturing uncertainties, and cascading investment risks that collectively slow deployments. The primary roadblock to a battery-data-science re- naissance is the requirement for large amounts of high-quality data, which are not available in the current fragmented ecosystem. Here, we identify gaps and propose principles that enable the solu- tion by building a robust community of data hubs with standardized practices and flexible sharing options that will seed advanced tools spanning innovation to deployment. Precedents are offered that demonstrate that both public good and immense economic gains will arise from sharing valuable battery data.

Data-driven pre- diction methods have shown promise for accurately predicting cell behaviors with low computational cost, but they are expensive to train. Furthermore, given that the risk of battery failure is already very low, gathering enough relevant data to facilitate data-driven predictions is extremely challenging. Here, a perspective for designing experiments to facilitate a relatively low number of tests, handling the data, applying data-driven methods, and improving our understanding of behavior-dictating physics is outlined. This perspective starts with effective strategies for experimentally repli- cating rare failure scenarios and thus reducing the number of exper- iments, and proceeds to describe means to acquire high-quality datasets, apply data-driven prediction techniques, and to extract physical insights into the events that lead to failure by incorporating physics into data-driven approaches.},

Identifying models with high accuracy and low uncertainty is crucial for ensuring that model extrapolations are believable, however, it is difficult to compose expressions that accurately predict multivariate data trends; a review of cycling degradation models from literature reveals a wide variety of functional relationships. Here, a machine-learning assisted model identification method is utilized to fit degradation in a stand-out LFP-Gr aging data set, with uncertainty quantified by bootstrap resampling. The model identified in this work results in approximately half the mean absolute error of a human expert model. Models are validated by converting to a state-equation form and comparing predictions against cells aging under varying loads. Parameter uncertainty is carried forward into an energy storage system simulation to estimate the impact of aging model uncertainty on system lifetime. The new model identification method used here reduces life-prediction uncertainty by more than a factor of three (86\% ± 5\% relative capacity at 10 years for human-expert model, 88.5\% ± 1.5\% for machine-learning assisted model), empowering more confident estimates of energy storage system lifetime.},

The kind of data you have determines how you can predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of something
\par
\section{\textbf{The Three RUL Methods}}

\subsection{\textbf{I. Lifetime Data}}

\par
\textbf{Data}: Just the single~\emph{lifetime number}~of a bunch of similar historic batteries
\par
\textbf{Algorithm}: Use a~\href{app://obsidian.md/Proportional\%20Hazard\%20Model}{Proportional Hazard Model}~to predict the prob. dist. of failure times, usually conditional upon some covariates e.g. given battery charging cycles, you predict the fraction of life remaining -- a~\href{app://obsidian.md/Survival\%20Function}{Survival Function}~plot which looks to me like 1 - cdf to me:
\par
(Baru and Johnson, 2023, p. 1)
\par
In this graph, it looks like they've got actual failures in their data; can this be done by extrapolation, as I've seen either done or mentioned in other papers that do extrapolation. \#Battery/SOH/Extrapolation
\par
\subsection{\textbf{II. Run-to-Failure Data}}

\par
\textbf{Algorithm}: To forecast remaining life for some test device, you pick the historical time series that looks most like the test device's (which includes multiple covariates, not just SOC or whatever); your forecast is failure time of the historical device with the best time series match.
\par
(Baru and Johnson, 2023, p. 2)
\par
\subsection{\textbf{III. Threshold Data}}

\par
\textbf{Data}: You have~\emph{no end-of-life data}, but you do know that, when certain~\emph{measurements}~are above~\emph{known thresholds}, the device will certainly fail.\\
\textbf{Algorithm}~So again, you do a sort of~\textbf{\href{app://obsidian.md/index.html\#Battery/SOH/Extrapolation}{\#Battery/SOH/Extrapolation}}, for the future of the current measurement values. My impression is that this~\emph{extrapolation method}~is physics based or follows a chosen statistical distributions e.g. (Hou et al., 2022)
\par
You can simplify by compressing the set of measurement values to a low dimension:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item e.g. PCA, probably to the 1st princ comp.
\item PCA can also transforms the thresholds linearly, so you then have a scalar (or low dim) threshold to check against
\item 
\par
A physics based method, like in (Shah et al., 2016)

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of the lithium-ion battery remaining useful life can effectively manage the lithium-ion battery health. Using the early cycle data to predict the remaining useful life can reduce consumption and detect battery failures earlier, but it is still a great challenge due to weak and high dimensional nonlinear feature data of the early cycle. In order to solve this issue, this paper proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that combines the idea of Broad Learning System (BLS), called BLS-LSTM, to accurately forecast the lithium-ion battery remaining useful life by using early cycle data. Firstly, according to the BLS idea, more effective feature nodes are obtained by performing mapping operations and enhancement operations on input features. Secondly, the characteristic nodes are input into the LSTM as new input nodes to predict the remaining useful life of the lithium-ion battery. Finally, the proposed model is validated with different early cycle data and compared with other methods. The results show that the BLS-LSTM model has better prediction performance and higher accuracy in the early prediction of the remaining useful life.},

  abstract = {Lithiumion (Li-ion) batteries have become increasingly useful within the automotive industry and modern life applications due to high energy and power densities. However, these batteries suffer capacity loss due to different ageing mechanisms in various applications. Despite several existing models, lack of accurate predictability of capacity degradation limits the advancement of Li-ion batteries. The present work focuses on prediction of battery useful capacity degradation using long-short term memory (LSTM) transfer learning neural network model. At first, a base model was developed and trained using all the (100\%) degradation data available at 0°C and 10°C environmental temperatures. Thereafter, the training of the base model was fixed, and additional hidden layers were added on top of the base model to further fine tune it with only the initial 30\% degradation data available at 25°C environmental temperature. The remaining (70\%) data of the 25°C case was tested for model prediction. To decide the number of fixed hidden layers to be transferred from base model to transfer model and the number of additional hidden layers on top, an optimization for minimum cross validation error was performed. It was found that the resulting model was able to forecast the remaining battery degradation with 96\% accuracy. The model prediction was also compared with LSTM deep learning architecture without using transfer learning. The LSTM with transfer learning model was found to be 17\% higher in prediction accuracy than that without utilizing transfer learning.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicles are increasingly becoming the vehicle of choice in today’s environmentally conscious society, and the heart of an electric vehicle is its battery. Today, lithium-ion batteries are mainly used to power electric vehicles for its increased energy storage density and longevity. However, in order to estimate battery life, long and costly battery testing is required. Therefore, there is a need to investigate efficient ways that could reduce the amount of testing required by reusing existing knowledge of aging patterns from different kinds of battery chemistry. This work aims to answer two research questions. The first addresses the challenge of battery cell testing data that contain battery cells that do not reach the End-of-Life (EOL) threshold by the time the testing has been completed. For this challenge, we propose to implement survival analysis that is able to handle incomplete data or what is referred to as censored data. The second addresses how to reuse a model trained on one type of battery cell chemistry to predict the EOL of another battery cell chemistry by implementing transfer learning. We develop a workflow to implement a prediction model for one type of battery cell chemistry and to reuse this pre-trained model to predict the EOL for another type of battery cell chemistry.},

The literature in this complex topic has grown considerably; this perspective aims to distil current knowledge into a succinct form, as a reference and a guide to understanding battery degradation. Unlike other reviews, this work emphasises the coupling between the different mechanisms and the different physical and chemical approaches used to trigger, identify and monitor various mechanisms, as well as the various computational models that attempt to simulate these interactions. Degradation is separated into three levels: the actual mechanisms themselves, the observable consequences at cell level called modes and the operational effects such as capacity or power fade. Five principal and thirteen secondary mechanisms were found that are generally considered to be the cause of degradation during normal operation, which all give rise to five observable modes. A flowchart illustrates the different feedback loops that couple the various forms of degradation, whilst a table is presented to highlight the experimental conditions that are most likely to trigger specific degradation mechanisms. Together, they provide a powerful guide to designing experiments or models for investigating battery degradation.},

Battery health monitoring and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction are needed to prevent catastrophic failure of the battery. The aim of this research is to develop a data-driven method to monitor the batteries state of health and predict their RUL by using the battery capacity degradation data. This paper also investigated the effect of prediction starting point to the RUL prediction error. One of the data-driven method drawbacks is the need of a large amount of data to obtain accurate prediction. This paper proposed a method to generate a series of degradation data that follow the Gaussian distribution based on limited battery capacity degradation data. The prognostic model was constructed from the new data using least square support vector machine (LSSVM) regression. The remaining useful life prediction was carried out by extrapolating the model until reach the end of life threshold. The method was applied to three differences lithium-ion batteries capacity data. The results showed that the proposed method has good performance. The method can predict the lithium-ion batteries RUL with a small error, and the optimal RUL starting point was found at the point where the battery has experienced the highest capacity recovery due to the self-recharge phenomenon.},

In the current work, series bench-scale tests are conducted using a cone calorimeter to explore the fire behavior of lithium-ion battery. The influence of two key factors, namely state of charge (SOC) and incident external heat flux, on the battery fire characteristics is especially investigated. Combustion behavior, time to ignition (TTI), heat release rate (HRR) and fire risk assessment are obtained. The battery with higher SOC under high incident heat flux presents a fierce combustion process and higher surface temperature than the others. It is noteworthy that the time to ignition and time to peak HRR (TTP) decrease with the SOC, whereas the peak HRR (pHRR) and total heat release (THR) increase overall. On the whole, the increment of incident heat flux causes the decrease in TTI and TTP, while the pHRR and THR increase at higher incident heat flux. And the values of TTI agree well with the classical ignition model. Finally, the fire risk of battery with different SOCs under various incident heat fluxes is also highlighted.},

  abstract = {To recycle retired series/parallel battery packs, it is necessary to know their state-of-health (SOH) correctly. Unfortunately, voltage imbalances between the cells occur repeatedly during discharging/charging. The voltage ranges for the discharge/charge of a retired series/parallel battery pack are reduced owing to the voltage imbalances between the cells. To determine the accurate SOH of a retired series/parallel battery pack, it is necessary to calculate the total discharge capacity using fully discharging/charging tests. However, a fully discharging/charging test is impossible owing to the reduced voltage range. The SOH of a retired series/parallel battery pack with a voltage imbalance should be estimated within the reduced discharging/charging voltage range. This paper presents a regression analysis of the peak point in the incremental capacity (IC) curve from the fresh state to a 100-cycle aging state. Moreover, the SOH of the considered retired series/parallel battery pack was estimated using a regression analysis model. The error in the SOHs of the retired series/parallel battery pack and linear regression analysis model was within 1\%, and hence a good accuracy is achieved.},

Failures of batteries can bring huge losses in terms of personnel, facility, environment, and reputation aspects. Therefore the accurate health estimation and high availability of batteries is urgently required by corresponding users, distributors, and manufactures. Fortunately, prognostics and health management (PHM) technique has been demonstrated the capability of supporting the improvement of the availability and reliability of batteries. In this paper, we gave a review on the state-of-the-art of the PHM study on batteries. We observed the increase of publication related to battery PHM in the past decade (2009-2018), especially in the past five years. Approaches related to battery performance prognostics are categorized into physics-based, data-driven and hybrid classes. Selection of the battery PHM approach requires to take the user requirement, data availability and degradation mechanisms attainability into consideration. Based on the survey, we also proposed research and development perspectives to conduct further studies on the battery PHM ,including the approach selection, health management, performance evaluation, uncertainty treatment, application economics, as well as environmental issues. We focused on PHM of lithium-ion batteries, given the fact that several publications discussed other types of batteries (e.g., lead-acid batteries).},

At the system level, the time-sequence map depicts the relationship between the expected thermal runaway propagation and the undesired fire pathway. Mitigation strategies are fulfilled by cutting off a spe- cific transformation flow between the states in the time sequence map.

Temperature, as a critical factor, significantly impacts on the performance of lithium-ion batteries and also limits the application of lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, different temperature conditions result in different adverse effects.

For the first time, this paper collects and analyses the safety challenges faced by LIB industries across sectors, and compares them to the research contributions found in all the review papers in the field. The comparison identifies knowledge gaps and opportunities going forward. Industry and research efforts agree on the importance of understanding thermal runaway at the component and cell scales, and on the importance of developing prevention technologies. But much less research attention has been given to safety at the module and pack scales, or to other fire protection layers, such as compartmentation, detection or suppression. In order to close the gaps found and accelerate the arrival of new LIB safety solutions, we recommend closer collaborations between the battery and fire safety communities, which, supported by the major industries, could drive improvements, integration and harmonization of LIB safety across sectors.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are widely employed in industries and daily life. Research on the state of health (SOH) of batteries is essential for grasping the performance of batteries, better guiding battery health management, and avoiding safety mishaps caused by battery aging. Nowadays, most research adopts a data-driven artificial intelligence approach to assess SOH. However, the majority of approaches are based on entire voltage, current, or temperature curves. In reality, voltage, current, and temperature are frequently presented in segments, leading to the limited flexibility and slow analysis speed of the traditional techniques. This study solves the problem by dividing the whole voltage curve into many typical kinds of segments with equal timescales based on different typical voltage beginning points. On this foundation, the temporal convolution network (TCN) is used to create a sub-model of SOH estimation for several typical kinds of segments. In addition, the sub-models are fused using the bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) approach to boost accuracy. Finally, this research uses a publicly available dataset from Oxford to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested strategy.},

  abstract = {A diagnostic technique capable of quantitatively estimating degradation modes in-operando, including loss of lithium inventory and loss of active material, which operates under charge and discharge loads with realistic thermal boundary conditions is presented for the first time. The technique uses a zero-dimensional heat generation model with only three parameters requiring estimation, a simple heat transfer model, and requires just three temperature measurements per cell, voltage and current. The technique has been demonstrated to work for pouch cells with tab cooling and a constant coolant temperature and for charge and discharge rates of C/2, 1C and 2C. Compared to state-of-the-art open circuit voltage (OCV) model methods, the technique predicts electrode capacities and offset of a fresh cell with accuracies of 3\% and 6\% respectively. Further the technique has been shown to predict loss of lithium and loss of active material in the positive and negative electrodes with accuracies of 0.18\%, 0.22\% and 1.99\% respectively. The technique can therefore provide information of the same quality as the current state-of-the-art techniques but works under application relevant conditions and due to its simplicity is suitable for implementation on-line in a battery management system (BMS).},

Meanwhile, flexible and practical techniques are promising and innovative for achieving accurate and cost-effective state estimation. Herein, a novel curvature-based method is proposed to track battery degradation conditions. The proposed technique can ingeniously capture the health features of an aged battery from incremental capacity curves. Specifically, an advanced filter is employed to smooth the incremental capacity curves. Secondly, a self-definition sine function is applied to fit the smoothed incremental capacity curves. The curvature-based technique provides an essential manner for extracting the health features including the peak value and position from the fitted incremental capacity curves. On this basis, a flexible cost-effective numerical aging model is constructed by mapping the relationship between the feature indicators and battery capacity for battery health prognostic. Finally, for verification of the generalization and accuracy, the developed model is to estimate battery health conditions with the same type of battery under different experimental conditions. Experimental results of two types of batteries manifest that the proposed algorithm can provide accurate and credible battery health conditions with maximum relative errors of less than 4\%.},

In this paper, the battery SoH is detected based on the dynamic characteristic of the charging current during the constant-voltage (CV) period. Firstly, according to the preliminary analysis of the battery test data, the time constant of CV charging current is proved to be a robust characteristic parameter related to the battery aging. Secondly, the detailed expression of the current time constant is derived based on the first order equivalent circuit model (ECM). Thirdly, the quantitative correlation between the normalized battery capacity and the current time constant is established to indicate the battery SoH. Specifically, for the uncompleted CV charging process, the logarithmic function-based current time constant prediction model and the reference correlation curve are established to identify the battery capacity fading. At last, experimental results showed that regardless of the adopted data size, the correlation identified from one battery can be used to indicate the SoH of other three batteries within 2.5\% error bound except a few outliers.},

We propose a novel method for accurate SOH estimation which does not necessarily need full charging data. Using only partial charging data during normal usage, 10 derived voltage values (\$\$\{v\}\_\{sei\}\$\$) are collected. The initial \$\$\{v\}\_\{sei\}\$\$ point is fixed and then for every 1.5\% increase in the Coulomb counting, other points are selected. The difference between the \$\$\{v\}\_\{sei\}\$\$ values (\$\$\textbackslash Delta \{v\}\_\{sei\}\$\$) and the average temperature during the charging form the feature vector at different SOH levels. The training data set is prepared by extrapolating the charging voltage curves for the complete SOH range using initial 400 cycles of data. The trained artificial neural network (ANN) based on the feature vector and SOH values can be used in any battery management system (BMS) with a time complexity of only \$\$O(\{n\}\textasciicircum\{4\})\$\$. Less than 1\% mean absolute error (MAE) for the test cases has been achieved. The proposed method has a moderate training data requirement and does not need any knowledge of previous SOH, state of charge (SOC) vs. OCV relationship, and absolute SOC value.},

  abstract = {Contemporary lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are one of the main components of energy storage systems that need effective management to extend service life and increase reliability and safety. Their characteristics depend highly on internal and external conditions (ageing, temperature, and chemistry). Currently, the state of batteries is determined using two parameters: the state of charge (SOC) and the state of health (SOH). Applying these two parameters makes it possible to calculate the expected battery life and a battery’s performance. There are many methods for estimating the SOH of batteries, including experimental, model-based, and machine learning methods. By comparing model-based estimations with experimental techniques, it can be concluded that the use of experimental methods is not applicable for commercial cases. The electrochemical model-based SOH estimation method clearly explains processes in the battery with the help of multidifferential equations. The machine learning method is based on creating a program trained to predict the battery’s state of health with the help of past ageing data. In this review paper, we analyze the research available in the literature in this direction. It is found that all methods used to assess the SOH of an LIB play an essential role, and each method has its pros and cons.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are chosen as the most suitable device for energy storage system (ESS) due to their high energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have high chemical reactivity, which increase the fire risk of products using them. Accordingly, various studies have been conducted to prevent lithium-ion battery-fire accidents but the main purpose of the conventional studies was to prevent the spread of fire after it started rather than predicting the risk of fire. Thus, there is a limit to reducing the maintenance time and cost of ESS. In this paper, a new method for real-time monitoring of the fire risk during operation of the battery pack is proposed. It combines with the electrochemical theory while using the real-time data from the electrically measured factors to select the aged cells. Also, a method of assessing the fire risk of battery packs by applying the interquartile range (IQR) filter to real-time data obtained from the electrically measured factors of battery packs is proposed. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified by the experiment using the specifications of the high-capacity battery packs used for railway vehicles.},

Despite numerous data-driven algorithms being developed to estimate battery SOH, they are often ineffective in handling time series data, as they are unable to utilize the most significant portion of a time series while predicting SOH. Furthermore, current data-driven algorithms are often unable to learn a health index, which is a measurement of the battery’s health condition, to capture capacity degradation and regeneration. To address these issues, we first present an optimization model to obtain a health index of a battery, which accurately captures the battery’s degradation trajectory and improves SOH prediction accuracy. Additionally, we introduce an attention-based deep learning algorithm, where an attention matrix, referring to the significance level of a time series, is developed to enable the predictive model to use the most significant portion of a time series for SOH prediction. Our numerical results demonstrate that the presented algorithm provides an effective health index and can precisely predict the SOH of a battery.},

This paper proposes a multi-dimensional health indicator (HI) battery state of health (SOH) prediction method involving the analysis of the battery equivalent circuit model and constant current discharge characteristic curve. The values of polarization resistance, polarization capacitance, and initial discharge resistance are identified as the health indicators reflective of the battery’s state of health. Moreover, the retention strategy genetic algorithm (e-GA) selects the optimal voltage drop segment, and the corresponding equal voltage drop discharge time is also used as a health indicator. Based on the above health indicator selection strategy, a battery SOH prediction model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and LSTM neural network is constructed, and its accuracy is validated. The experimental results demonstrate that the suggested strategy is accurate and generalizable.

By analyzing the charging and discharging process of batteries, the indirect health indicator (HI), which is highly correlated with capacity, is extracted in this paper. HI is taken as the input of CNN, and the convolution and pooling operations of CNN layers are used to extract the features of battery time series data.

  abstract = {Accurate degradation trajectory and future life are the key information of a new generation of intelligent battery and electrochemical energy storage systems. It is very challenging to obtain accurate predictions against uncertain application conditions by using only a few known historical data. In this article, we extend the widely studied remaining useful life (RUL) prediction to the prediction of charge and discharge capacity trajectories under both fixed and random future operating conditions. This is achieved by developing a general deep learning framework cored by recurrent neural network (RNN) which integrates future current plan and few early capacity-voltage data as inputs. As a case study, we have experimented with 77 commercial batteries cycled under fixed and random operating conditions. We demonstrate that the median root mean square error (RMSE) of prediction can be within 2.4\% for NMC/graphite batteries and 2.3\% for LFP/graphite batteries by using 3.8\% of the whole life data only. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed framework predicts more accurately and has a very balanced performance for both fixed and random future conditions.

  abstract = {Future capacity prediction of lithium-ion batteries is a highly researched topic in the field of battery management systems, owing to the gradual degradation of battery capacity over time due to various factors such as chemical changes within the battery, usage patterns, and operating conditions. The accurate prediction of battery capacity can aid in optimizing its usage, extending its lifespan, and mitigating the risk of unforeseen failures. In this paper, we proposed a novel fine-tuning model based on a deep learning model with a transfer learning approach comprising of two key components: offline training and online prediction. Model weights and prediction parameters were transferred from offline training using source data to the online prediction stage. The transferred Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory with an Attention Mechanism model weights and prediction parameters were utilized to fine-tune the model by partial target data in the online prediction phase. Three battery batches with different charging policy were used to evaluate the proposed approach’s robustness, reliability, usability, and accuracy for the three charging policy batteries’ real-world data. The experiment results show that the proposed method’s efficacy improved, with an increase in the cycle number of the starting point, exhibiting a linear relationship with the starting point. The proposed method yields relative error values of 8.70\%, 6.38\%, 9.52\%, 7.58\%, 1.94\%, and 2.29\%, respectively, for the six target batteries in online prediction. Thus, the proposed method is effective in predicting the future capacity of lithium-ion batteries and holds potential for use in predictive maintenance applications.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries is critical for accelerating technological advancements and applications. Nevertheless, the complex aging mechanisms and dynamic operating conditions of lithium-ion batteries have remained major challenges. This paper proposes a method for early predicting lithium-ion batteries cycle life based on weighted least squares support vector machine (WLS-SVM) with health indicators (HIs) as input. The HIs are extracted from lithium-ion batteries voltage-capacity discharge curves, since these curves are easy to measure and strongly correlate to battery cycle life. Taking into account the nonlinearity of batteries cycle life, a support vector machine (SVM) that is capable of strong generalization is used to predict cycle life. As a solution to the problem of misleading results from outlier data in SVM, error square term combined with weight functions is used in this study to improve robustness and prediction accuracy. The datasets of 41 cells are used to verify the proposed early prediction method. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of cycle life prediction results by the proposed method are much lower, and the cycle life early prediction errors of the test cells are all {$<$}9~\%, which notes that the proposed method is accurate and valid for cycle life early prediction.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries play an important role in providing necessary energy when acting as a main or backup source of electricity. Indeed, the unavailability of battery aging discharge data in most real-world applications makes the State of Health (SoH) assessment very challenging. Alternatively, accelerated aging is therefore adopted to emulate the degradation process and to achieve an SoH estimate. However, accelerated aging generates limited deterioration patterns suffering from a higher level of complexity due to the non-linearity and non-stationarity imposed by harsh conditions. In this context, this paper aims to provide a predictive model capable of solving incomplete data problems by providing two main solutions for each of the problems of complexity and missing patterns, respectively. First, to overcome the problem of lack of patterns, a robust collaborative feature extractor (RCFE) is designed by collaborating between a set of improved restricted Boltzmann machines (I-RBMs) to be able to share learning knowledge among different locally trained I-RBMs to create a more generalized global extraction model. Second, a set of RCFEs is then evolved through a neural network with an augmented hidden layer (NAHL) to enhance the predictive ability by further exploring representation learning to overcome pattern complexity issues. The designed RCFE-NAHL is trained to predict SoH using constant current (CC) discharge characteristics by implying multiple characteristics recorded through the constant voltage (CV) charging process as indicators of health. The proposed SoH prediction approach performances are evaluated on a set of battery life cycles from the well-known NASA database. In this context, the achieved results clearly highlight the higher accuracy and robustness of the proposed learning model.},

Irrespective of the application, reliable real-time estimation of battery state of health (SOH) by on-board computers is crucial to the safe operation of the battery, ultimately safeguarding asset integrity. In this Article, we design and evaluate a machine learning pipeline for estimation of battery capacity fade—a metric of battery health—on 179 cells cycled under various conditions. The pipeline estimates battery SOH with an associated confidence interval by using two parametric and two non-parametric algorithms. Using segments of charge voltage and current curves, the pipeline engineers 30 features, performs automatic feature selection and calibrates the algorithms. When deployed on cells operated under the fast-charging protocol, the best model achieves a root-mean-squared error of 0.45\%. This work provides insights into the design of scalable data-driven models for battery SOH estimation, emphasizing the value of confidence bounds around the prediction. The pipeline methodology combines experimental data with machine learning modelling and could be applied to other critical components that require real-time estimation of SOH.},

  abstract = {Wind turbine (WT) condition monitoring has gained increasing interests in the era of the Internet of Energy (IoE), and existing monitoring approaches mainly focus on training a reliable model in a centralized manner. However, there are three main challenges: data islands due to data privacy and strict confidentiality of wind farm owners, domain shift due to distribution difference of different WTs, and computing and communication burden due to a large number of model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient federated transfer learning framework (EFTLWT) for collaborative monitoring of WTs in IoE-enabled wind farms, which integrates the adversarial domain adaptation into the federated framework to address the domain shift issue across multiple WTs from different wind farms. It is the first attempt to apply federated transfer learning into the field of WT monitoring. Specifically, we design a lightweight multi-scale neural network model to reduce the computation and communication cost between the client and the server. Furthermore, we propose a partial aggregation strategy to aggregate partial model parameters to reduce the model weight during the uploading and downloading, thus further reducing the burden of communication bandwidth and speeding up the response of the monitoring system. We carry out extensive experiments on real operating datasets of WTs and the results show that our EFTLWT can effectively reduce the domain shift and communication cost, decrease the response time, and greatly improve the performance of the local and federated model while maintaining the favorably comparable performance as the centralized model.},

Unfortunately, these models are prone to significant estimation errors without appropriate knowledge of their inherent limitations and the interdependence between stress factors. This article presents a review of empirical and semiempirical modeling techniques and aging studies, focusing on the trends observed between different studies and highlighting the limitations and challenges of the various models. First, we summarize the main aging mechanisms in lithium-ion batteries. Next, empirical modeling techniques are reviewed, followed by the current challenges and future trends, and a conclusion. Our results indicate that the effect of stress factors is easily oversimplified, and their correlations are often not taken into account.

  abstract = {Remaining useful life prediction is one of the key requirements in prognostics and health management. While a system or component exhibits degradation during its life cycle, there are various methods to predict its future performance and assess the time frame until it does no longer perform its desired functionality. The proposed data-driven and model-based hybrid/fusion prognostics framework interfaces a classical Bayesian model-based prognostics approach, namely particle filter, with two data-driven methods in purpose of improving the prediction accuracy. The first data-driven method establishes the measurement model (inferring the measurements from the internal system state) to account for situations where the internal system state is not accessible through direct measurements. The second data-driven method extrapolates the measurements beyond the range of actually available measurements to feed them back to the model-based method which further updates the particles and their weights during the long-term prediction phase. By leveraging the strengths of the data-driven and model-based methods, the proposed fusion prognostics framework can bridge the gap between data-driven prognostics and model-based prognostics when both abundant historical data and knowledge of the physical degradation process are available. The proposed framework was successfully applied on lithium-ion battery remaining useful life prediction and achieved a significantly better accuracy compared to the classical particle filter approach.},

However, deconvoluting the effect of capacity, state of charge, and temperature on EIS response is complicated analytically. Here, various machine-learning models, such as linear, Gaussian process, random forest, and artificial neural network regression, are utilized to predict capacity from EIS using hundreds of capacity, direct current (DC) resistance, and EIS measurements recorded under varying conditions of health, temperature, and state of charge (SOC). Several feature extraction and selection methods from traditional electrochemical analysis and statistical modeling are explored using machine-learning pipelines. EIS data from just two frequencies can accurately predict capacity, and interrogation shows that the optimal set of frequencies is not usually intuitive. Best results are achieved with an ensemble model, which predicts battery capacity with a mean absolute error of 1.9\% on data from unobserved cells.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries degrade over time, based on their usage and these changes can be observed in the terminal voltage and cell expansion curves with respect to SOC. Physics-based battery models augmented with degradation modes can describe the changes in battery electrical and mechanical response as the battery ages and can be tuned to predict the observed rate of change. Tuning these models is computationally intensive, because it requires multiple simulations of the battery aging process over the entire lifetime. Accelerated simulations that use an adaptive inter-cycle extrapolation algorithm [1] can reduce simulation time and thus enable use of optimization algorithms to automatically tune degradation models [2]. In this work, we investigate how the amount of aging data used to train the model impacts the prediction of future battery aging assuming the battery continues to operate under the same conditions. The electrode-specific state of health (eSOH) parameters are computed from the reference performance testing performed at periodic intervals throughout the battery's lifetime. These four parameters include the capacities of positive and negative electrodes Cp and Cn, and the corresponding electrode stoichiometric windows y0 and x100. These 4 parameters extracted from a cell aged at C/5 constant current charging rate were used for training the model. The aging model includes SEI growth in the negative electrodes which causes a loss of cyclable lithium/loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and loss of electrode active material (LAM) due to particle cracking at both the negative and positive electrodes. Simulation results show us that a shorter training window of three eSOH reference points (every 25 cycles) over (Cycles 41 to 98) over-predicts battery degradation because the rate of degradation during these initial cycles is larger than the degradation which happens later in the battery's life. The battery degradation parameters that are predicted (and shown in the figure) include battery capacity, maximum reversible swelling in the battery, loss of active material in the negative electrode and loss of lithium inventory. If we increase the model training window to five eSOH data points (Cycles 41 to 175), the prediction of battery degradation is much better because the model now accounts for both the initial higher rate of degradation and subsequent lower rate of degradation.},

  abstract = {Various modeling techniques are used to predict the capacity fade of Li-ion batteries. Algebraic reduced-order models, which are inherently interpretable and computationally fast, are ideal for use in battery controllers, technoeconomic models, and multi-objective optimizations. For Li-ion batteries with graphite anodes, solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) growth on the graphite surface dominates fade. This fade is often modeled using physically informed equations, such as square-root of time for predicting solvent-diffusion limited SEI growth, and Arrhenius and Tafel-like equations predicting the temperature and state-of-charge rate dependencies. In some cases, completely empirical relationships are proposed. However, statistical validation is rarely conducted to evaluate model optimality, and only a handful of possible models are usually investigated. This article demonstrates a novel procedure for automatically identifying reduced-order degradation models from millions of algorithmically generated equations via bi-level optimization and symbolic regression. Identified models are statistically validated using cross-validation, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification via bootstrapping. On a LiFePO4/Graphite cell calendar aging data set, automatically identified models utilizing square-root, power law, stretched exponential, and sigmoidal functions result in greater accuracy and lower uncertainty than models identified by human experts, and demonstrate that previously known physical relationships can be empirically “rediscovered” using machine learning.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries can last many years but sometimes exhibit rapid, nonlinear degradation that severely limits battery lifetime. In this work, we review prior work on “knees” in lithium-ion battery aging trajectories. We first review definitions for knees and three classes of “internal state trajectories” (termed snowball, hidden, and threshold trajectories) that can cause a knee. We then discuss six knee “pathways”, including lithium plating, electrode saturation, resistance growth, electrolyte and additive depletion, percolation-limited connectivity, and mechanical deformation—some of which have internal state trajectories with signals that are electrochemically undetectable. We also identify key design and usage sensitivities for knees. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities for knee modeling and prediction. Our findings illustrate the complexity and subtlety of lithium-ion battery degradation and can aid both academic and industrial efforts to improve battery lifetime.},

  abstract = {Reduced-order physics-based life models are extremely useful for rapidly predicting battery state-of-health and for simulating battery lifetime in arbitrary aging conditions. However, identification of well-parameterized models is difficult. This is because, for maximum usefulness in predicting lifetime under a variety of conditions, aging test data exhibits many degradation mechanisms, which all need to be accurately modeled. However, because aging tests are time-consuming and expensive, especially for large-format batteries, a minimum of tests are conducted while probing many stress factors. Building a well-parameterized model is then very challenging: an under-parameterized model will neglect critical degradation modes, and an over-parameterized model will extrapolate poorly to new testing conditions. To complicate this matter, the functional form of the model for any individual degradation rate can be very difficult to identify. In this work, the statistical tools of penalized regression and bilevel optimization are used to help identify both the functional forms of and optimize the parameters of reduced-order life models, accelerating identification of robust models. Model robustness is demonstrated through traditional statistics methods of cross-validation and sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification through bootstrap resampling and Monte-Carlo simulation, and simulation of real-world use cases.},

Yet, concerns about safety and reliability remain major obstacles, which must be addressed in order to improve the acceptance of this technology. The gradual degradation of Li-ion cells over time lies at the heart of this problem. Time, usage and environmental conditions lead to performance deterioration and cell failures, which, in rare cases, can be catastrophic due to fires or explosions. The physical and chemical mechanisms responsible for degradation are numerous, complex and interdependent. Our understanding of degradation and failure of Li-ion cells is still very limited and more limited yet are reliable and practical methods for the detection and prediction of these phenomena.

Owing to the rapid growth of Li-ion battery users, unwanted incidents involving Li-ion batteries have also increased to some extent. In particular, the sudden breakdown of industrial and lightweight machinery due to battery failure causes a substantial economic loss for the industry. Consequently, battery state estimation, management system, and estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) have become a topic of interest for researchers. Considering this, appropriate battery data acquisition and proper information on available battery data sets may require. This review paper is mainly focused on three parts. The first one is battery data acquisitions with commercially and freely available Li-ion battery data set information. The second is the estimation of the states of battery with the battery management system. And third is battery RUL estimation. Various RUL prognostic methods applied for Li-ion batteries are classified, discussed, and reviewed based on their essential performance parameters. Information on commercially and publicly available data sets of many battery models under various conditions is also reviewed. Various battery states are reviewed considering advanced battery management systems. To that end, a comparative study of Li-ion battery RUL prediction is provided together with the investigation of various RUL prediction algorithms and mathematical modelling.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of global electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and aerospace, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become more and more widely used due to their high property. More and more disasters are caused by battery combustion. Among them, the temperature prediction of LIBs is the key to prevent the occurrence of fire. At present, using surface temperature sensor to measure the temperature of LIBs is the main method. High-capacity LIB packs used in electric vehicles and grid-tied stationary energy storage system essentially consist of thousands of individual LIB cells. Therefore, installing a physical sensor at each cell, especially at the cell core, is not practically feasible from the solution cost, space, and weight point of view. So developing a new method for battery temperature prediction has become an urgent problem to be solved. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a widely applied non-destructive method of characterization of LIBs. In recent years, methods of predicting LIBs temperature by EIS have been developed. The prediction of LIBs temperature based on EIS has the advantages of high real-time performance and prediction accuracy, and the device is simple and practical. The proposed method has a good development prospect in electric vehicles and other fields and can effectively solve the current problems of LIBs temperature prediction. Therefore, it is urgent to summarize these works to promote the next development. This review summarizes the main methods of using EIS to predict the temperature of LIBs in recent years, including the methods based on the impedance, phase shift, and intercept frequency. The principle and application of various methods are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of different methods and the future development direction are discussed. Highlights Use EIS to quickly and effectively predict the internal temperature changes of LIBs. No hardware temperature sensors and thermal model are required. The methods to predict battery temperature based on impedance, phase shift, and intercept frequency are reviewed.},

  abstract = {With an increasingly wider application of the lithium-ion battery (LIB), specifically the drastic increase of electric vehicles in cosmopolitan cities, improving the thermal and fire resilience of LIB systems is inevitable. Thus, in-depth analysis and performance-based study on battery thermal management system (BTMs) design have arisen as a popular research topic in energy storage systems. Among the LIB system parameters, such as battery temperature distribution, battery heat generation rate, cooling medium properties, electrical properties, physical dimension design, etc., multi-factor design optimisation is one of the most difficult experimental tasks. Computational simulations deliver a holistic solution to the BTMs design, yet it demands an immense amount of computational power and time, which is often not practical for the design optimisation process. Therefore, machine learning (ML) models play a non-substitute role in the safety management of battery systems. ML models aid in temperature prediction and safety diagnosis, thereby assisting in the early warning of battery fire and its mitigation. In this review article, we summarise extensive lists of literature on BTMs employing ML models and identify the current state-of-the-art research, which is expected to serve as a much-needed guideline and reference for future design optimisation. Following that, the application of various ML models in battery fire diagnosis and early warning is illustrated. Finally, the authors propose improved approaches to advanced battery safety management with ML. This review paper aims to bring new insights into the application of ML in the LIB thermal safety issue and BTMs design and anticipate boosting further advanced battery system design not limited to the thermal management system, as well as proposing potential digital twin modelling for BTMs.},

A set of Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide (NCA), Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO) and Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO) Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with 25–100\% state of charge (SOC) was externally heated-to-fire. From the experimental results, we generated empirical equations to predict the onset of thermal runaway (TRonset) and hazards such as maximum surface temperature (Tsurf), and flame temperature (Tflame) except for LMO LIBs due to their violent explosions. To demonstrate the accuracy of predictions, we compared the results predicted with another set of test data from the same LIBs but different SOCs and evaluated the accuracy using percentage error (\%Er). The developed empirical equations achieved higher prediction accuracy, with the TRonset reaching the \%Er of less than 10\% for both NCA and LCO LIBs. The lower SOC (20\%) showed the greatest discrepancy, with the maximum \%Er of 2.7 and 7.4\% in LCO and NCA, respectively. A large variation of \%Er in Tsurf was observed regardless of SOC due to violent explosion, and \%Er reached the maximum of 15.4\% and 24.0\% in NCA and LCO, respectively. In Tflame, the highest \%Er observed for NCA and LCO are 25.6\% and 29.9\%, respectively. Overall, \%Er show no correlation with SOC in any of the TRonset, Tsurf and Tflame predictions. LMO as the most energy dense of the three LIB samples, many of them ruptured violently during the test. In light of the growing demand for energy dense LIBs, new empirical equations should include ruptured samples as well.},

The application of the lithium-ion batteries which previously circulating and contained around small-scale electronics is now expanding into large scale emerging markets such as electromobility and stationary energy storage. Therefore, the understanding of the risk involved is imperative. Thermal runaway is the most common failure mode of lithium-ion battery which may lead to safety incidents. Transport process of immense amounts of heat released during thermal runaway of lithium-ion battery to neighboring batteries in a module can lead to cascade failure of the whole energy storage system. In this work, a model is developed to predict the propagation of lithium-ion battery in a module for large scale applications. For this purpose, kinetic of material thermal decomposition is combined with heat transfer modelling. The simulation is built based on chemical kinetics at component level of a singular cell and energy balance that accounts for conductive and convective heat transfer.},

It was further validated by uniform heating tests of 21700 cells conducted with flexible and nichrome-wire heaters, respectively.

Timely and fast battery thermal runaway prognosis is essential but restricted by limited parameters and complex influencing factors during real-world operation of EVs, i.e., environment, driving behavior, and weather. To cope with the issue, several data-driven methods are combined, and the thermal runaway prognosis is realized by two steps, i.e., temperature prediction by the modified extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and then abnormality detection by the principal component analysis (PCA) and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The XGBoost is modified and trained by data of real-world EVs to couple the influencing factors during the real-world operation of EVs. For parameter optimization, the “pretraining and adjacent grid optimizing method” (P-AGOM) and the “adjacent grid optimizing method” (AGOM) are proposed to achieve locally optimal hyperparameters for XGBoost and DBSCAN. Verified results showcase that the XGBoost-PCA-DBSCAN achieves accurate 5-min-forward temperature prediction, and the mean square errors (mses) of four seasons are only 0.0729, 0.0594, 0.0747, and 0.0523, respectively. By modification of XGBoost, the mse of temperature prediction is reduced by 31.2\%. In addition, the 35-min-forward thermal runaway prognosis by the XGBoost-PCA-DBSCAN will provide the driver sufficient response time to minimize the loss of life and property.},

The normalized battery voltages are used to achieve accurate identification of battery early faults.

This paper proposes a diagnosis method of thermal runaway for ternary lithium-ion battery systems based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering. Two-dimensional fault characteristics are first extracted according to battery voltage, and DBSCAN clustering is used to diagnose the potential thermal runaway cells (PTRC). The periodic risk assessing strategy is put forward to evaluate the fault risk of battery cells. The feasibility, reliability, stability, necessity, and robustness of the proposed algorithm are analyzed, and its effectiveness is verified based on datasets collected from real-world operating electric vehicles. The results show that the proposed method can accurately predict the locations of PTRC in the battery pack a few days before the thermal runaway occurrence.},

  abstract = {Thermal runaway (TR) propagation is triggered in a battery pack by abnormalities such as a cell fire or explosion, which leads to severe consequences. Predicting the TR propagation is challenging due to the complex, high non-linearity, and uncertain disturbances of TR. This paper establishes an electro-thermal coupling simulation model of TR propagation to supplement experimental data and public datasets for model training and verification. Then, a data-driven fusion model named Multi-Mode and Multi-Task Thermal Propagation Forecasting Neural Network (MMTPFNN) is established quantitative advance multi-step prediction of TR propagation in Li-ion battery modules, and a temperature-based TR propagation grading warning strategy is proposed. The TR propagation is mainly influenced by the thermal characteristics of surrounding batteries, and the temperature distribution in the entire battery module is of great significance to the prediction of TR propagation. Herein, the model is presented by using the thermal image and the discrete operating data of cells. Furthermore, because TR is a small probability event, obtaining the thermal image of the battery module requires additional system memory and computational resources. A switching strategy of the prediction model is established to improve the applicability of the model with the temperature threshold of 60~°C. When the battery is in a safe temperature range (below 60~°C), the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is run to predict the battery temperature. Once the battery temperature is detected above 60~°C, the thermal image is captured, and the MMTPFNN model is run to predict the TR propagation. In the validation section, different network structures are discussed, and different time resolutions and different window settings of the MMTPFNN are compared. Finally, the early warning strategy with three alert levels is introduced, and the effectiveness of the warning strategy with different window settings and initial SoCs is further discussed.},

On the premise of passing the manufacturer's safety inspections, a variety of methods for monitoring and detecting thermal runaway events are developed to enhance the safety and robustness of lithium-ion batteries in different application scenarios.

The electric quantity normalized concentration ceq is defined and used to construct the corresponding numerical relationship between temperature and voltage in the model. This model can effectively fit the battery TR temperature and voltage variation behavior under both adiabatic TR test and oven test results. Furthermore, the model-based analysis proves that the temperature and voltage changes during the TR can be mutually obtained through the stable numerical coupling relationship. Besides, the relationship between SOC and the concentration field is established. Moreover, the feasibility of using the normalized concentration to couple the voltage and temperature signal is verified.

However, fire and explosion accidents caused by thermal runaway have attracted widespread attention. Studies have shown that lithium plating of Li-ion batteries during low-temperature aging can seriously affect their thermal stability. Still, there is no corresponding mathematical model to analyze and predict the thermal runaway behavior of batteries during the whole life cycle after low-temperature aging. In this paper, the evolution of thermal runaway behaviors and kinetics caused by the low-temperature aging is analyzed by the stage division and analysis of the thermal runaway process based on the adiabatic thermal runaway tests. The results show that the low-temperature aging significantly affects the thermal kinetics of the battery and accelerates the thermal runaway process. By investigating several groups of experimental results, a prediction method for the kinetic parameters of side reactions of batteries with arbitrary state of health (SOH) is proposed, and a numerical model for the prediction of thermal runaway during the whole life cycle is established based on the reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the proposed model is experimentally verified to accurately predict the thermal runaway behaviors of Li-ion batteries during the whole life cycle after low-temperature aging.},

The modelling of TR is difficult due to the broad range of cell properties and potential conditions. Understanding the effect that thermo-physical and heat transfer characteristics have on the TR abuse model output is essential to develop more accurate and robust TR models. This study uses global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to investigate the effect of the cell parameters on the outcome of TR events. Using a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model to calculate the Sobol’ indices, it is shown that the emissivity value is the dominant thermo-characteristic throughout the overall abuse scenario. Further analysis, investigating three key TR features shows the conductivity coefficient to be the most important with respect to the maximum temperature reached during TR. Results demonstrate that researchers can confidently estimate some thermo-characteristics but require accurate characterisation of the emissivity and conductivity coefficient to ensure robust predictions. Given the importance of battery technology to aid in global de-carbonisation, these findings are key to increasing their safe design and operation.},

While much work has been done on understanding the kinetics of various heat generation processes during thermal runaway, relatively lesser work exists on understanding how heat removal from the cell influences thermal runaway. Through a unified analysis of heat generation and heat removal, this paper derives and experimentally validates a non-dimensional parameter whose value governs whether or not thermal runaway will occur in a Li-ion cell. This parameter is named the Thermal Runaway Number (TRN), and comprises contributions from thermal transport within and outside the cell, as well as the temperature dependence of heat generation rate. Experimental data using a 26650 thermal test cell are in good agreement with the model, and demonstrate the dependence of thermal runaway on various thermal transport and heat generation parameters. This parameter is used to predict the thermal design space in which the cell will or will not experience thermal runaway. By combining all thermal processes contributing to thermal runaway in a single parameter, this work contributes towards a unified understanding of thermal runaway, and provides the fundamental basis for design tools for safe, high-performance Li-ion batteries.},

However, the TRP prediction is challenging because of the substantial uncertainty and hard-to-acquire data. To solve this problem, a fuzzy system and multi-task CNN-LSTM method are proposed to predict TRP multiple steps ahead. The TRP dataset is constructed by 25 sets of experiments and 130 sets of simulations. The uncertain SoC, charging and discharging conditions, and thermal runaway (TR) trigger points are considered in both experiments and simulations. Then, the fuzzy system is introduced to reason about the TR probability of the battery and optimized by a sparrow search algorithm (SSA). A multi-task CNN-LSTM model is proposed to extract fuzzy and physical information by employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) and multiple long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, respectively, and output the temperature of multiple cells simultaneously. Finally, the models are evaluated in the simulation and experimental validation sets with different window lengths and time resolutions. The results show that the fuzzy information significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the method, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 98.48\% for the 3s prediction horizon and 97.27\% for the 18s prediction horizon in the experimental validation set.},

  abstract = {In this study, a multiphysics-informed neural network (MPINN) is proposed for the estimation and prediction of thermal runaway (TR) in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). MPINNs are encoded with the governing laws of physics, including the energy balance equation and Arrhenius law, ensuring accurate estimation of time and space-dependent temperature and dimensionless concentration in comparison to a purely data-driven approach. Specifically, the network is trained using data from a high-fidelity model of an LIB, which describes TR by addressing several coupled partial differential equations. Quantitative analysis reveals that the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of the MPINN for TR estimation are less than an artificial neural network (ANN) by 0.71 and 1.57, respectively, when using fully labeled data for training. It outperforms the ANN in terms of MAE and RMSE by 90.56 and 118.64, when only a small portion of labeled data (semi-supervision) are used for TR prediction. Importantly, it predicts TR without any labeled data when the decomposition of reactive species is modeled in the positive electrode. The MPINN exhibits promising results in surrogate modeling, implying it can be successfully implemented in practical scenarios and stimulate further research related to TR modeling using physics-informed deep learning.},

In this paper, we propose a methodology for dynamic risk prediction by integrating fault tree (FT), dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) and support vector regression (SVR). FT graphically describes the logic of mechanism of thermal runaway. DBN allows considering multiple states and uncertain inference for providing quantitative results of the risk evolution. SVR is subsequently utilized for predicting the risk from the DBN estimation. The proposed methodology can be applied for risk early warning of LIB thermal runaway.},

In this paper, a detailed method is presented to make long-term predictions for the RUL based on a combination of gated recurrent unit neural network (GRU NN) and soft-sensing method. Firstly, an indirect health indicator (HI) was extracted from the charging processes using a soft-sensing method that can accurately describe power degradation instead of capacity. Then, a GRU NN with a sliding window was applied to learn the long-term performance development. The method also uses a dropout and early stopping method to prevent overfitting. To build the models and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a real-world NASA battery data set with various battery measurements was used. The results show that the method can produce a long-term and accurate RUL prediction at each position of the degradation progression based on several historical battery data sets.},

In this work, the thermal runaway propagation (TRP) process of the 18,650-type LIB module is studied by experimental and modeling methods. A novel experimental-based Domino prediction model is proposed, which can predict the TRP path and its probability. The calculation part of the model is realized with the Matlab software. This model for the first time proposes that whether the battery thermal runaway (TR) is a probability event, and the probability is a function of its temperature. To verify the feasibility of the model, the TRP process in a 4~×~4 arrangement battery module with three different first TR battery locations is detailed analyzed. The results show that the dangerous level ranking of cell locations from low to high is the corner location, the edge location, and the location near the module center. Higher dangerous level means more maximum probability TRP paths and higher probability. Moreover, it was found that the whole TRP process can be divided into four stages: the TRP trigger stage, the heat accumulation stage, the Domino effect stage, and the TRP stop stage. The proposed model can effectively predict the TRP process in modules, and the results have important reference value for the design of the battery thermal management system and the research on the method of blocking TRP.},

Taking 70 Hz impedance as an example, the thermal runaway accident can be successfully avoided by cutting off the charging when the slope turns positive from negative during charging. The warning time is 580 s ahead of the thermal runaway. This feature is easy to identify and requires no complex mathematical models and parameters.

Temperature rise prediction is crucial for LiB safety management in an all-climate electric vehicles application because many disastrous consequences are caused by high temperature. This study mainly investigates the ESC-caused temperature rise characteristics of LiB, and proposes an online prediction approach of the maximum temperature rise. Three original contributions are made: (1) Abusing tests of LiBs under ESC are conducted at varying ambient temperatures, and the influences of battery state of charge (SOC) and ambient temperature on the maximum temperature rise are revealed. (2) Characteristics of temperature rises are analysed, therein finding that the heat generation of LiBs caused by ESC presents two modes: Joule heat-dominant mode and reaction heat/Joule heat blended mode; leakage is an external manifestation of the latter. (3) Two heat generation modes are proved to be linearly separable at temperature rise discharge capacity plane, and then a two-step prediction approach of maximum temperature rise is proposed based on support vector machine. Finally, the presented approach is validated by the experimental data. The maximum temperature rise can be predicted up to 22.3\,s ahead of time and very precise prediction results are obtained, where the mean prediction error for the eight test cells is 3.05\%.},

Li-ion battery systems require the use of a battery management system (BMS) to perform safely and efficiently. Accurate and reliable battery modeling is important for the BMS to function properly. Currently, many BMS applications use the equivalent circuit model due to its simplicity. However, with the development of a cloud BMS, machine learning battery models can be utilized, which can potentially improve the accuracy and reliability of the BMS. This work investigates the performance of four different machine learning models used to predict the thermal (temperature) and electrical (voltage) behaviors of Li-ion battery cells. A prismatic Li-ion battery cell with a capacity of 25 Ah was cycled under a constant current profile at three different ambient temperatures, and the surface temperature and voltage of the battery were measured. The four machine learning regression models—linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and decision tree—were developed using the scikit-learn library in Python and validated with experimental data. The results of their performance were reported and compared using the R2 metric. The decision tree-based model, with an R2 score of 0.99, was determined to be the best model in this case study.},

  abstract = {Accurate monitoring of capacity degradation of a lithium-ion battery is important as it enables the user to manage the battery usage for optimal performance/lifetime and to take preemptive measures against any potential explosion or fire. Battery capacity fades gradually through repetitive charging and discharging until it reaches the so called ‘knee-point’, after which it goes through rapid and irreversible deterioration to reach its end-of-life. It is crucial to forecast the knee-point early and accurately for safety and economic use of the battery. Machine learning based methods have been used to predict the knee-point with early cycles cell data. Despite some notable progress made, the existing methods make the unrealistic assumption of constant cycle-to-cycle charge/discharge operation. In this study, a novel two-stage deep learning method is proposed for online knee-point prediction under variable battery usage. A CNN-based model extracts temporal features across past and current cycles to sort out those that should be monitored closely for near-term failures, and then predict the number of cycles left to reach the knee-point for them. The proposed method extracts features from time-series data and thus reflects dynamic changes in battery properties, resulting in improved prediction performance under realistic scenarios.},

In this work, we present a novel Time-Series Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (TS-WGAN) approach for SOC estimation of lithium-ion batteries, characterized by a well-designed data preprocessing process and a distinctive WGAN-GP architecture. In the data preprocessing stage, we employ the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to identify strongly associated features and apply feature scaling techniques for data normalization. Moreover, we leverage polynomial regression to expand the original features and utilize principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the computational load and retain essential information by projecting features into a lower-dimensional subspace. Within the WGAN-GP architecture, we originally devise a Transformer as the generator and a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) as the critic to make the most of local (CNN) and global (Transformer) variables. The overall model is trained with the WGAN, incorporating gradient penalty loss for training purposes. Simulation outcomes using real-road dataset and laboratory dataset reveal that TS-WGAN surpasses all baseline methods with enhanced accuracy, stability, and robustness. The coefficient of determination (R2) for both datasets exceeds 99.50\%, demonstrating its potential for practical application.},

However, a failure of lithium-ion batteries can cause some catastrophic accidents, such as electric car battery explosion fires and so on.

In this paper, an adaptive noise reduction approach is proposed to predict the RUL (Remaining Useful Life) of lithium-ion batteries, which uses CEEMDAN (Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise) combined with wavelet decomposition to achieve adaptive noise reduction decomposition, and then inputs the obtained IMF (Intrinsic Mode Function) components into LS–RVM (Least Square Relevance Vector Machine) for training, prediction, and reconstruction, so as to achieve high-precision prediction of RUL. Moreover, in order to verify the validity of the model, the model in this paper is compared with other common models.

The thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries is the phenomenon of chain exothermic reactions within the battery. These reactions cause a sharp rise in the internal battery temperature causing the inner structures of the battery to destabilize and degrade, which eventually leads to the failure of the battery. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the key aspects of the thermal runaway processes, which consists of thermal runaway initiation mechanisms, thermal runaway propagation, and the characterization of vented gases during the thermal runaway process. Thermal runaway is a major safety concern; therefore, the development of mathematical and numerical models to predict thermal runaway is reviewed, which provides useful data to design and develop battery packs with thermal runaway safety features. Furthermore, the development of effective battery thermal management systems is discussed, which is essential to prevent thermal runaway initiation. Finally, mitigation strategies are reviewed, which are developed to contain and minimize damages when thermal runaway occurs.},

  abstract = {The accurate estimation and prediction of lithium-ion battery state of health are one of the important core technologies of the battery management system, and are also the key to extending battery life. However, it is difficult to track state of health in real-time to predict and improve accuracy. This article selects the ternary lithium-ion battery as the research object. Based on the cycle method and data-driven idea, the improved rain flow counting algorithm is combined with the autoregressive integrated moving average model prediction model to propose a new prediction for the battery state of health method. Experiments are carried out with dynamic stress test and cycle conditions, and a confidence interval method is proposed to fit the error range. Compared with the actual value, the method proposed in this paper has a maximum error of 5.3160\% under dynamic stress test conditions, a maximum error of 5.4517\% when the state of charge of the cyclic conditions is used as a sample, and a maximum error of 0.7949\% when the state of health under cyclic conditions is used as a sample.},

Yet, such claims are often based on an arbitrary selection of elections, and inadequate statistical analysis. Using data on all presidential elections, we show that height is indeed an important factor in the US presidential elections. Candidates that were taller than their opponents received more popular votes, although they were not significantly more likely to win the actual election. Taller presidents were also more likely to be reelected. In addition, presidents were, on average, much taller than men from the same birth cohort. The advantage of taller candidates is potentially explained by perceptions associated with height: taller presidents are rated by experts as ‘greater’, and having more leadership and communication skills. We conclude that height is an important characteristic in choosing and evaluating political leaders.},

Various faults of lithium-ion batteries are usually undetectable in their early stage due to their concealment and graduality.

The early frequency-domain features of the fault signals are extracted utilizing the high-frequency detail wavelet components, and a multilevel fault prognosis strategy is developed considering complex charging/driving characteristics under real-vehicle operating conditions. The verification results, implemented on loose wire connection batteries and real-scenario thermal runaway batteries, demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately extract and locate the hidden fault signals even under small magnitudes and effectively detecting and isolating battery faults before thermal runaway. Furthermore, significant reliability and stability of the proposed method are verified on more real-vehicle operation data, enabling online monitorable and traceable of battery faults before triggering thermal runaway, safeguarding drivers and passengers in real-world vehicular operation.},

Different approaches dealing with the onboard estimation of battery State-of-Charge (SoC) or State-of-Health (SoH) have been extensively discussed in various researches in the past. However, the topic of SoAP prediction has not been explored comprehensively yet. The prediction of the maximum power that can be applied to the battery by discharging or charging it during acceleration, regenerative braking and gradient climbing is definitely one of the most challenging tasks of battery management systems. In large lithium-ion battery packs because of many factors, such as temperature distribution, cell-to-cell deviations regarding the actual battery impedance or capacity either in initial or aged state, the use of efficient and reliable methods for battery state estimation is required. The available battery power is limited by the safe operating area (SOA), where SOA is defined by battery temperature, current, voltage and SoC. Accurate SoAP prediction allows the energy management system to regulate the power flow of the vehicle more precisely and optimize battery performance and improve its lifetime accordingly. To this end, scientific and technical literature sources are studied and available approaches are reviewed.},

  abstract = {To investigate the characteristics of lithium-ion battery packs under the condition that one cell is short-circuited when the whole battery pack is being discharged or charged, systematic battery external short circuit (ESC) experiments are conducted. Since not all battery cells are equipped with current sensors because of the space limitation and manufacturing cost, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based method is proposed to estimate the current of the short-circuited cell using only the voltage information, which is the feasible practice in electric vehicle application. Furthermore, the estimated current is used to predict maximum temperature increase as well as internal and surface temperature distribution of the ESC cell based on a 3D electro-thermal coupling model. Two experimental groups under constant current charging condition and constant power discharging condition are employed to validate the stability and accuracy of the proposed method. The results indicate that the rootmean-square-error between the estimated and measured current are 3.72 A and 6.61 A under the two validation experiments respectively, and the maximum estimation errors of temperature increase are 4.9 °C and 7.3 °C respectively.},

The question on how to ensure safety of billions of automotive batteries during their lifetime remains unanswered. In this study, we overcome the challenge by developing machine learning techniques based on the recorded data that are uploaded to the cloud. Using charging voltage and temperature curves from early cycles that are yet to exhibit symptoms of battery failure, we apply data-driven models to both predict and classify the sample data by health condition based on the observational, empirical, physical, and statistical understanding of the multiscale systems. The best well-integrated machine learning models achieve a verified classification accuracy of 96.3\% (exhibiting an increase of 20.4\% from initial model) and an average misclassification test error of 7.7\%. Our findings highlight the need for cloud-based artificial intelligence technology tailored to robustly and accurately predict battery failure in real-world applications.},

The whole system reliability assessment is based on the reliability evaluation of system components including individual battery modules and power electronic converters. In order to evaluate the reliability of a battery module, a reliability model based on the state of health of individual battery cells is introduced. The state of health of a battery cell is calculated based on the capacity fade of the cell using a weighted Ampere-hour (Ah) throughput method. A universal generating function (UGF) based method is then introduced to evaluate the reliability of the battery module. The reliability model of DC/AC power electronic converters is also presented in the paper. The reliability analysis is conducted for battery storage systems with different system configurations and management strategies; and the influence of system configuration on the reliability of battery system is studied. Comparative studies are conducted for a classic battery energy storage system (BESS) and a reconfigurable battery energy storage system (RBESS) to demonstrate the advantages of having a reconfigurable system topology. The comparison results show that the proposed RBESS has higher system reliability and more power outputs than the classic BESS.},

However, IRENA Energy Transformation Scenario forecasts that these targets should be at 61\% and 9000~GWh to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and limit the global temperature rise within the twenty-first century to under 2~°C. Despite widely known hazards and safety design of grid-scale battery energy storage systems, there is a lack of established risk management schemes and models as compared to the chemical, aviation, nuclear and the petroleum industry. Incidents of battery storage facility fires and explosions are reported every year since 2018, resulting in human injuries, and millions of US dollars in loss of asset and operation. Traditional risk assessment practices such as ETA, FTA, FMEA, HAZOP and STPA are becoming inadequate for accident prevention and mitigation of complex energy power systems. This work describes an improved risk assessment approach for analyzing safety designs in the battery energy storage system incorporated in large-scale solar to improve accident prevention and mitigation, via incorporating probabilistic event tree and systems theoretic analysis. The causal factors and mitigation measures are presented. The risk assessment framework presented is expected to benefit the Energy Commission and Sustainable Energy Development Authority, and Department of Standards in determining safety engineering guidelines and protocols for future large-scale renewable energy projects. Stakeholders and Utility companies will benefit from improved safety and reliability by avoiding high-cost asset damages and downtimes due to accident events.},

  abstract = {Batteries are crucial for building a clean and sustainable society, and their performance is highly affected by aging status. Reliable battery health assessment, however, is currently restrained by limited access to sufficient aging data, resulting from not only complicated battery operations but also long aging experimental time (several months or even years). Refining industrial datasets (e.g., the field data from electric vehicle batteries) unlocks opportunities to acquire large-volume aging data with low experimental efforts. We introduce the potential of combining industrial data with accelerated aging tests to recover high-quality battery aging datasets, through a migration-based machine learning. A comprehensive dataset containing 8,947 aging cycles with 15 operational modes is collected for evaluation. While saving up to 90\% experimental time, aging data can be recovered with ultra-low error within 1\%. It provides an alternative solution to significantly improve data shortage issues for assessment of battery and energy storage aging.},

This is a way to generate a ton of near-lab-quality capacity trajectories from operational industrial batteries, but you still have to wait for the end of the operational battery lifespan. The generated data can be used to train accurate capacity models for similar industrial batteries (I think it says), as well as for other prediction targets, like SOH, although this is not tested. ~Capacity result is very accurate: {$<$}1\% RMSE with only 3 capacity tests throughout the battery life (which 3\% of the time needed for laboratory test).

\subsubsection{Tidbits}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\par
lab tests are expensive
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item hundreds or thousands of equivalent cycles
\item several months to a year (but a year is shorter than waiting for the industrial batteries used for modeling to die, isn’t it?)

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{industrial data is a huge}, if compromised, source; Chinese example has 1M more points than the open MIT-Standford battery aging dataset (mentions CALC and NASA sets too)
\item \textbf{industrial data normally not suitable} for model training: doesn’t cover the range of operation or full charge/discharge
\item important to evenly space the 3 capacity tests

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Method}

\par
Use industrial batteries in operation to generate accurate aging (capacity degradation) models without frequent capacity measurements (only 3, spread through battery’s lifespan) using large data sets of batteries in operation, not following any cycling experiments.
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item Do a laboratory accelerated test on a test battery of the same type (I think), measuring the capacity trajectory and collecting, \textbf{x}, corresponding sets of voltages, currents, temp (I think).
\item Train a base model, a simple 3 layer NN to predict the capacity given \textbf{x}. ~I think they’re predicting \emph{incremental capacity} “IC” (Tang et al., 2021, p. 2).
\item On the target battery (the with only industrial data), do 3 or so laboratory capacity tests, at 0\%, 50\% and 100\% the battery’s lifespan (during industrial operation, I guess). ~
\item 
\par
Generate fake target battery capacity data between the lab tests
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item predict capacity using the base model
\item correct by interpolating from the laboratory capacity tests. ~They call this piecewise linear, but \emph{I don’t quite get it.}

\end{enumerate}

\item Use fake target battery capacities to train other models, I guess.\\

However, as with all energy sources, batteries  carry a certain risk of failure. For LIB this can result in  gassing and burning, potentially harming people and  property. The ongoing trend towards ever higher energy  densities literally adds fuel to the fire.  Figure 1 shows the trade-offs typically made in the design  of LIB. To achieve higher energy densities, manufacturers  use more reactive materials while minimizing safety  margins. With more energy stored in a single battery,  larger amounts of energy are released in case of a failure.   With the fast growth of the battery industry, the number  of battery incidents has also increased. One prominent  example is the 2019 fire at an APS site in McMicken,  Arizona. A battery failure led to a massive explosion in one  of the storage containers, causing millions in damages  and hospitalizing several firefighters. In the automotive  world, General Motors, Hyundai, and Kia had to recall over  200,000 electric vehicles between 2020 and 2021 after  more than 30 battery fires.

  abstract = {The use of electrochemical cells is becoming more widespread, especially in the energy industry and battery energy storage systems (BESSs). As we continue to deploy BESSs, it becomes increasingly important for us to understand how these systems age and accurately predict their performance over time. This knowledge is essential for ensuring that the systems operate optimally and can be properly maintained. Since the structure of a BESS is different from a single electrochemical cell, the existing models at the cell level cannot predict and estimate the life of the BESS with suitable accuracy. Furthermore, the test protocols available at the cell level mostly cannot be executed at the BESS level for many reasons. Therefore, in this paper, a review of test protocols for building aging models for BESSs has been performed. After reviewing the protocols for a single electrochemical cell and addressing the differences between BESSs and cells, a review of the works performed on a larger scale has been carried out, and the possible ways for testing the BESS for aging models were investigated.},

  abstract = {We study the optimal control of battery energy storage under a general “pay-for-performance” setup such as providing frequency regulation and renewable integration. In these settings, batteries need to carefully balance the tradeoff between following the instruction signals and their degradation costs in real-time. Existing battery control strategies either do not consider the uncertainty of future signals, or cannot accurately account for battery cycle aging mechanism during operation. In this paper, we take a different approach to the optimal battery control problem. Instead of attacking the complexity of a battery degradation function or the lack of future information one at a time, we address these two challenges together in a joint fashion. In particular, we present an electrochemically accurate and trackable battery degradation model called the rainflow cycle-based model. We prove that the degradation cost is convex. Then, we propose an online control policy with a simple threshold structure and show that it achieves near-optimal performance with respect to an offline controller that has complete future information. We explicitly characterize the optimality gap and show that it is independent to the duration of operation. Simulation results with both synthetic and real regulation traces are conducted to illustrate the theoretical results.},
