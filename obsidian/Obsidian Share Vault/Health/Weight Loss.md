# Exercise vs. Diet in Weight Loss
- calories are 10X more imp. than exercise; ultraprocessed food especially bad: [[Reynolds25whatCausesObesity|Reynolds25: What causes obesity? A major new study is upending common wisdom.]] 
- Many False Calorie Burning Beliefs: [[Reynolds24ExercisingLoseWeight|Reynolds24: Exercising to lose weight? Science says it rarely works.]] 
- **However**, high intensity reduces appetite, and **causes 10% less eating**, so it's not just the calories that you burn.  See [Evernote: "How Exercise Can Help Us Eat Less"  Reynolds, New York Times, 2013](https://share.evernote.com/note/13d62b97-df8e-4817-868d-b323634a05e7)
- A lot of **exercise can cause body fat loss** (not necessarily body fat), after the first 1000 cals/wk burned by exercise are compensated for by more (probably unconscious) eating -- study subjects weren't on diets
	- after that, the exercise-induced calorie deficit did result in body fat loss 
	- a 3000al/wk exercise cal deficit resulted in 5% body fat loss (2000 cal/wk after extra eating accounted for)
		- I think this is 300 mins/wk of moderate exercise
	- if muscle increased, this might not have shown up in total body mass (measured in [[Reynolds25whatCausesObesity]], I think)
	- They don't mention the slowdown mentioned in [[Reynolds25whatCausesObesity|Reynolds25whatCausesObesity]] .  Hmmm.

- Running study: people who lost weight and kept it off burned 2,800 calories/week by exercising -- apparently, this was without dieting
