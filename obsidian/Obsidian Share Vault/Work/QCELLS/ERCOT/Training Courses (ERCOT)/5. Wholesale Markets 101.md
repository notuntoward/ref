# Introduction
- `Operating Day` and `Operating Hour`
	- day and hour of power delivery
	- timestamps are <u>Right Handed</u>:  3:00 hour ends at 3:00
- `Day-ahead`: the day before the operating day
- `Adjustment period`
	- after DA close, somewhat before operating hour
	- start:18:00 DA, end: 1 hr b/f operating hour
		- [ ] ? so for 3:00, adjustment periods ends at 1:00 wall clock time?  *I'm pretty sure that's right,*
		- `hour ahead` the 1 hour gap (1:00-2:00) in wall clock time
- QSEs have central role in wholesale mkt, since responsible for both load and resources
- Bids and offers
	- `bid`: money load will pay (bidding on power on the power market)
		- product, location, and price, and time, too, right?
	- `offer`: money supply wants (offering power on the power market)
		- product, location, price, and time, too, right?
- price optimal supply and demand curves
	- DAM: clear highest price bids and lowest price offers first
	- if intersect, a solution is reached
	- if don't intersect, process continues until either all bids or all offers are consumed
- cost optimal: offer only curve
	- reliability focused
	- buyers are price takers
	- offers cleared until have satisfied demand
- wholesale is settled @ 3 different points (also see [[4. Locational Marginal Pricing#^wvbj|settlement points]])
	- resource node: where generators are
	- 345kV hub: connections of 345kV stations
	- load zone: geographical collection of load stations
# Real-Time Dispatch and Pricing
- "really talking about a" single operating hour within and operating day
- dispatch goals
	- reliability
		- gen == dmd
		- transmission flow within limits
	- operate at least cost
- example (simple system)
# Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED)

*I'm not sure if this is considered part of RTM...*

![[5. Wholesale Markets 101-20240813174500376.webp|375]]

- `base points`: dispatch instructions
- SCED expects an `energy offer curve` (monotonically non-decreasing)
	- min offer is 1 MW
	- max of 10 price/MW pairs
	- (-$250-$9000)
- `system condidtions`
	- needs load, generators, line topology/capacity
	- `network operations model`
		- describes grid
		- used for both reliability studies and all market processes
		- [ ] ? if for reliability, is this public?
- illustrative examples
	- <u>ties in lowest offer curve price</u> energy offer curves start at same price, activate both and follow their lowest-cost curve until demand satisfied.
	- <u>forced outage</u>: if you've been dispatched, but there was a forced outage, you still get the dispatched price for the power you agreed to deliver, even though you didn't deliver it.
# Forward Markets
- `hedging`: pay a known price now, to be protected from an unknown price later
- examples
- DAM
	- it's a centralized forward market
	- solution is optimized over entire day, constrained by network model
	- output is hourly awards (amts of power), and prices
	- `Three-part Supply Offer`
		- startup offer
		- min. energy offer
		- energy curve offer (energy above min energy offer (hourly), excluding startup)
	- `DAM energy-only offer`
		- not assoc. w/ a real generator
		- you sell energy on DAM
		- you must get it somehow, or else on RTM settlement price
		- **why** you'd do this: you think RTM prices will be higher than current DAM
		- **goal** of ERCOT: drive DAM and RTM prices together, same idea as [CAISO convergence](<Existing CAISO Forecast Types.md#^a7f9>)
	- `DAM Engery bid`
		- proposal to buy energy in DAM
		- submit bid curve, will get <u>any</u> settlement point, if awarded
			- QSE pays DAM price
			- QSEs with load can lock in prices on DAM, possibly make money
- Bilateral Trades
	- individual traders make these, then must (?) report to ERCOT
	- QSE-to-QSE
	- transfers settlement responsibility: QSEs must do it
# Energy Settlements
- QSEs do their own, report to ERCOT, ERCOT does DAM, RTM
- DAM:
	- charges by ERCOT (e.g. bids) are positive (money flowing in); minuses are offers ERCOT must pay for ^oi1z
		- bid: awarded MW * `DASPP` (day ahead settlement point price)
		- offer: (-1) MW * DASSP
- RTM
  ![[__temp__5. Wholesale Markets 101-20240814160327233.webp|247]]
	- (-1) ((supplies) - (obligations)) * RTSPP
	- `supplies` (of energy you can use)
		- ? metered gen, DAM energy purchases, Trade (bilateral?) energy purchases
	- `obligations` (of energy you must provide or purchase somewhere)
		- ? DAM energy sales, trade (bilateral?) energy sales, metered load
- Units
	- DAM awards, settles: hourly MW
	- ? Energy Trades (bilateral?): hourly MW
	- RT settles: 15 min MWs
- RTM energy example 1
  ![[5. Wholesale Markets 101-20240814161224206.webp|214]]
  ![[5. Wholesale Markets 101-20240814161321908.webp|350]]
	- RTM energy balance for 07:00-7:15
		- DAM offer (200 MWh) is awarded (you're obligated to provide over an hour, you already got money for it on DAM?)
		- RTM Generation (45M MWh in 15 minutes)
		  - DAM energy (MWh) obligation is divided by 4 for 15 min RTM interval 
		  - (15 min RTM gen) - (15 min DAM obligation)
		    - 45 - 200/4 = 45 - 50 = `-5 MWh` 
		- so, you're generating 5 MWh less than your DAM obligation.  Must buy it.
	- Financial balance over time range (7-7:15):
	    - must buy 5 MWh of RTM power (why multiplier is RTM price)
	    - (-1) * (-5 MWh) * $20/MWh = $100
	    - [plus sign means ERCOT gets a payment](<work/ERCOT/Training Courses (ERCOT)/5. Wholesale Markets 101.md#^oi1z >)
	      - that's consistent: QSE pays ERCOT $100 for extra RTM energy
- RTM example 2

	**My Calcs**
- On DAM, their accepted bid was 25 MHw/15 min (they bought power)
- their RTM load matched DAM purchase for 1300 and 1400
- 1315: DAM exceeded load, can sell excess
	- [ ] ? but how do we know their 1 MWh RTM bid was accepted?  Is it automatically accepted?
- 1345: DAM below load, must buy power
	- [ ] ? how know that you're cleared in RTM? is this automatic?

| RTM Interval | RTM load MWh | DAM power MWh | DAM shortfall MHw | RTSSP ($/MWh) | RTM imbal cost ($) |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| 1315         | 24           | 25            | -1                | 30            | -30                |
| 1330         | 25           | 25            | 0                 | 31            | 0                  |
| 1345         | 26           | 25            | 1                 | 75            | 75                 |
| 1400         | 25           | 25            | 0                 | 70            | 0                  |
| **Total**    |              |               | 0                 |               | $45                |

<u>You owe</u>: (100 MW DAM * $35) + $45 RTM = $3545 (you pay ERCOT **$3545**)

<u>Comment</u>: DAM + RTM helped
- 1315: could sell excess DAM power on RTM
- 1345: could buy RTM supply
- 1345: DAM power a little more expensive than RTM
- 1400: DAM power much cheaper than RTM
- RTM-only mkt participation cost would have cost you **$5195** (answer given)
# Congestion
### Examples
- plain congestion example (lessons learned by me)
	- when they say "price at the bus," they mean "on the side of the line before the transmission constraint"
	- when they say "price at the hub," they mean "the lowest price of all the busses connected to the hub that are not already selling all they can"
		- [ ] ? how do you buy power at a hub?  Don't you need to be on a buss to connect?
	- when congestion, prices are different at different locations
- QSE and Load Zone congestion example
	- refer to settlement prices [here](<4. Locational Marginal Pricing.md#^krp8>)
	- both load and trade purchases are settled in RTM, doesn't say anything about DAM.  
		- [ ] ? Is DAM "Trade"?
	- difference in price at hub and load point
### Hourly Financial instruments: DAM point-to-point obligations
  ![[5. Wholesale Markets 101-20240815175407562.webp|361]]
- hedges RT congestion costs
- [ ] ? only for power sources, not consumers?
- QSE can pay congestion cost in DAM, don't wait to RTM
- is hourly (DAM durations, even though RTM is 15 min, Ithink)
- Buying DAM PTP obligations can help you avoid high RTM sink-source price
	- in DAM: for congestion hedge, pay the obligation
		- `sink - source price` (the obligation)
		- [price is set in separate DAM auction](<work/ERCOT/Training Courses (ERCOT)/5. Wholesale Markets 101.md#^kkso >), at DAM time
		- you pay obligation * MW power you've sold 
	- in RT: you just pay the difference
		- then, you are paid back the `RTM_obligation` * the power you've sold
		- where RTM_obligation = `RTM sink - RTM source price`
	- you are always charged the RTM sink-source
	- but, if have fully paid the DAM sink-source you repaid the RTM `sink-source`
		- [ ] ? only if paid if full?
		- whether you get paid or charged in RTM depending upon if sink-source price is positive or negative in real-time.  **Trick**
	- so, in effect, you paid the DAM sink-source price
- How to buy them ^kkso
	- PTP obligation is another thing you can buy on DAM (in addition to energy bid)
	- must define 
		- sink and source settlement points
		- MW of power
		- sink-source price you're willing to pay
	- [ ] ? but is there really a market?  Who is selling the DAM obligations?  Is there a curve or something?
- Summary
	- purchased at DAM price spread
	- settled at RTM price spread
### Monthly Financial Instruments: Congestion Revenue Rights (CRR)
- [ ] ? sold at an auction (every month, or rolling month-long?)
- settled at DAM price spread (cashed out)
- two types
	- point-to-point obligation
		- payment or charge in DAM
	- point-to-point option
		- payment in DAM (never a charge)
- examples
	- Point-to-point <u>obligation</u>
	  ![[__temp__5. Wholesale Markets 101-20240815183911574.webp|262]]
		- CRR1 is a payment; CRR2 is a charge
	- Point-to-point <u>options</u>
	  ![[5. Wholesale Markets 101-20240815184320584.webp|259]]
- `CRR account holder`
	- only participant who can own CRRs
	- can be both a QSE and a CRR account holder
	- buy CRRs at an auction
		- have both bids and offers
		- can sell (offer) CRRs it already holds
	- mkt settle uses a network model optimization that ensures that power flows could actually happen
		- schedule of CRR auctions eveloped years in advance
		- posted on CRR calendar at ercot.com
- CRRs sold in time of use (TOU) blocks, one month strips

# Ancillary Services

## AS Types
### Regulation Service
- security solved in SCED, runs every 5 mins
- 5 mins not fast enough: car on hills at constant speed shows power can go up and down a lot in 5 minutes
- similar to spinning generators
- regulation changes between 5 min baseload
  ![[5. Wholesale Markets 101-20240815190339331.webp|315]]
- responds in seconds
- but need 2 more ancillary service types
	- generator fail
	- transmission fail
	- system load could be bigger or rampier than expected
### Responsive Reserve Service

- why
	- loss of large generator
	- large load ramp
- must respond within minutes, fully deliverable within 10 mins
### Non-Spinning Reserve Service a.k.a. non-spin

- why
	- larger load than expected (system-wide)
	- local transmission issues (regionally)
- 30 min "lead time"

## AS acquired mainly in DAM

- might be supplemental mkts closer to RT
- three-part supply offer
- AS offer
  ![[__temp__5. Wholesale Markets 101-20240815191134907.webp|332]]
- single resource can offer multiple resources and energy
- **Co-optimization**
	- DAM bids/offers for both energy and AS (co-optimized)
# System Capacity

## Introduction

- `system capacity`: 
	- total of generation available during operation hour
- two capacity needs
	- meet hourly load forecast
	- enough AS capacity
- `Current Operating Plan (COP)`
	- for a resource
		- resource status
		- resource limits
		- ancillary service commitments
	- submitted by QSE
	- QSE must maintain COP for every hour in next 7 days
## Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC)

- examples showing actions when mismatch between forecasted load and gen
- RUC takes cost-optimal actions
- includes network model
- really depends upon forecasted load and weather (also RES gen?)
- RUC typically does nothing
- Two RUCs
	- `DRUC`: right after DAM close
	- `HRUC`: every hour in operating day, priority in next few hours
