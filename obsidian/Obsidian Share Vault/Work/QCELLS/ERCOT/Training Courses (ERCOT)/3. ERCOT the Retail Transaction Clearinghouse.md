# Retail Competition in ERCOT
- ERCOT started as a reliability coordinator for monopolistic utilities
- now transmission is separated, run by ERCOT
- Generators can now sell power directly to retail providers OR to the ERCOT market
- `Competitive Area`:an area in which a collection of retail reps compete
- reps get a bill for consumed power at the end of the 
- `NOIE`s: non-opt-in entities, munis and co-ops that decided to remain unbundled, can still opt in to mkt and compete.  White areas are NOIE

# Retail Market Players
- NOIEs actually still are LSEs (or connect to LSEs, I wasn't sure)
- CR (competitive retailer) 
	- are the only ones that interacti with consumers
	- enroll new customers, transfer to new provider
	- do not read customer meters
# Retail Transaction Processing
- three processes
	- move in
	- move out
	- switch retail electric provider
- ERCOT involved in all three
- CRs, TDSPs and ERCOT exchange retail transaction messages ~ 100K/day
	- ERCOT stores the transaction history
	- in some standard format
- end of day settlement processing:

- market participant can subscribed to transaction and recreate ("shadow") their own settlements
