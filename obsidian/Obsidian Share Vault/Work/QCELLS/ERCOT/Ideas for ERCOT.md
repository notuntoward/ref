- scenarios from AWS chronos
	- I believe it makes them directly
	- Example: [Zero-Shot Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting using CHRONOS. | by Rakesh M K | Write A Catalyst | Medium](https://medium.com/write-a-catalyst/zero-shot-time-series-forecasting-using-chronos-ad99240c8117)
	- Eval coverage and length using libs in MAPIE e.g. [MAPIE/examples/regression/1-qu...](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/MAPIE/blob/master/examples/regression/1-quickstart/plot_timeseries_example.py)
- scenarios from conformal
	- get dense quantiles from MAPIE
	- fix them up with
