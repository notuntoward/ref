Gemni and Copilot were both wrong in their first answers -- obvious self-contradictions that a human would detect. Gemni corrected itself after a correction prompt (<span style="color:#ff0000">verify this!</span>) but Copilot was still wrong after two correction prompts (could continue this with the <span style="color:#92d050">Restart button</span>, which sometimes helps, and is worth pointing out in any case) 

Also, stochasticity and non-reproducibilty (the bane of sofware test engineers (A lead-in to LLMOPS)): Copilot got it right after I restarted.
# Gemni
## Initial Prompt (Gemni)
Wrong

## Correction Prompt (Gemni)

I believe it fixed the error
![[__temp__Bing Copilot and Google Gemni Errors-20240308124341209.webp]]
# Initial Prompt (Copilot)

Copilot didn't listen to correction prompts until I cleared its mind (clicked the new topic button)

**Points to make**
- flushed that big context buffer to clear its mind
- nice references on the bottom (Gemni rarely provides them, Zak says they're an open question, or something like that)
- different references for right answer
- ["2 of 4"](#Correction%20Prompt%202%20(Copilot)]) and [[#Copilot hitting context Window Limit|"4 of 4"]] context window limits, forces a restart to keep computation tractable.
- further questions can be useful

<span style="color:#0070c0">Below is the above screenshotted response, in full, retrieved by using the copilot copy button.</span>

Certainly! Let‚Äôs explore an example of how the **inverse supply curve** operates in practice, specifically in the context of electricity markets.

1. **Electricity Market Scenario**:
    
    - Imagine a regional electricity market where power suppliers generate electricity and sell it to consumers.
    - The market equilibrium price (where supply equals demand) is initially set at $50 per megawatt-hour (MWh).
2. **Regular Supply Curve**:
    
    - Suppose we start with a regular upward-sloping supply curve for electricity.
    - As the price of electricity increases, more suppliers are willing to produce and sell electricity.
    - For instance:
        - At $40/MWh, suppliers offer 1000 MWh.
        - At $50/MWh (the equilibrium price), suppliers offer 1200 MWh.
        - At $60/MWh, suppliers offer 1400 MWh.
3. **Inverse Supply Curve**:
    
    - Now, let‚Äôs consider the inverse supply curve, which shows the relationship between the **price** and the **quantity supplied**.
    - As prices rise, suppliers adjust their production levels differently:
        - At a higher price (e.g., $60/MWh), suppliers are willing to produce and offer **less** electricity (say, 1400 MWh).
        - At a lower price (e.g., $40/MWh), suppliers are willing to produce and offer **more** electricity (say, 1000 MWh).
    - The inverse supply curve slopes downward, indicating this negative correlation.
4. **Factors Influencing the Inverse Supply Curve**:
    
    - **Production Costs**: Suppliers consider their costs (fuel, labor, maintenance) when deciding how much electricity to produce. Higher costs lead to a steeper inverse supply curve.
    - **Resource Availability**: If renewable energy sources (like wind or solar) are abundant, the inverse supply curve may be flatter.
    - **Technological Constraints**: Some power plants can‚Äôt ramp up or down quickly, affecting their responsiveness to price changes.
5. **Market Shifts**:
    
    - Changes in demand or supply conditions shift the inverse supply curve.
    - For example:
        - If a heatwave increases electricity demand, the curve shifts to the right (higher quantity supplied at each price).
        - If a new natural gas plant comes online, the curve shifts to the left (lower quantity supplied at each price).
6. **Implications**:
    
    - Understanding the inverse supply curve helps policymakers and market participants make informed decisions.
    - It affects pricing strategies, investment decisions, and grid stability.

Remember, while bananas might not directly apply to electricity markets, the concept of inverse relationships remains essential for understanding supply dynamics! üçå‚ö°Ô∏è

**Observations:**

- The US has the largest population by far, followed by Mexico and then Canada. However, Canada has the lowest population density.
- The US boasts the largest total economy, but <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Canada has the highest GDP per capita among the North American countries</mark>.
- Mexico has the lowest GDP per capita and the shortest average lifespan.
- Canada shares similarities with both Europe (high lifespan, lower working hours) and the US (larger economy).
- The US has the longest working hours.

**Additional Points:**

- Consider healthcare systems: The US has a private system, while most others have universal healthcare.
- Language: The UK, France, and Germany have their own dominant languages. The US and Canada are predominantly English-speaking, while Mexico is Spanish-speaking.

Remember, this is a snapshot. Each country has a rich history and culture that contributes to these statistics.
