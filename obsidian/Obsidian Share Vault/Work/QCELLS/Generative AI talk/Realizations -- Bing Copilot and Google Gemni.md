Idea here is to show that there are different realizations of the same idea.  How *maybe* Copilot's settings are allowing less plausible but more variant answers.  

For Gemni, all I've seen is that there are different "drafts," and on quick inspection, they weren't that different, but I haven't looked at them that carefully either.
