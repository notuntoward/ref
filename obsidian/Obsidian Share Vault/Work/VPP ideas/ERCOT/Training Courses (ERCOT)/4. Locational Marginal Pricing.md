- location of prices in ERCOT
	- locally, by generator
	- regionally by `load center`
	- somewhere in between
- `settlements points`
	- all energy is settled at one of these
	- Three types of settlement points
		- Resource nodes
			- point where resource's output is connected to transmission system
		- Load Zones
			- geographic grouping of loads
			- price is cost of bringing electricity to zone
			- ERCOT has 13
				- 4 competitive, N, S W and Houston
				- 4 NOEI load zones
					- 3 are required to have their own NOEI load zone.  One is Austin
					- last one (Rayburn) decided on it when mkt was created
				- 5 DC Tie load Zones
					- allow limited connection outside of ERCOT
					- designed to contain external disturbances
					- when power goes outside of ERCOT here, it's measured as "load" 
		- Hubs
			- only for bilateral trades or DAM awards
			- are groups of 345 kV substations
				- long haul lines moving power from energy-rich areas (big wind, solar?) to loads 
			- an energy pricing point between generators and load centers
			- 7 hubs in ERCOT
				- 5: N, S, W, Houston, panhandle hub
				- two hubs for representing ERCOT system average price
					- ERCOT hub average (avg price across ERCOT)
					- ERCOT bus average 
- Settlement point prices ^wvbj
	- locational marginal price: 
		- calculated @ `electrical bus`,  "most granular" point modeled in ERCOT
	- `electrical bus` is generally a substation
		- load substation: stepdown point
		- generator substation
		- utility tie substation
		- types
			- resource bus
			- load bus
			- hub bus
			- others
	- LMP
		- **Price**: cost
		- **marginal**: increase in cost to produce an increment more of load
		- **locational**: at an <u>electrical bus</u>
	- LMP examples
		- the usual: clear cheapest generator until load satisfied, price for everybody is most expensive generator cleared
	- `congestion rights` ^o7vr
		- congestion causes ERCOT to collect more from consumers of power than it pays to acquire that power.  The excess is used to hedging instruments [[2. ERCOT the Market#CRR: Congestion Revenue Rights auction|CRR: Congestion Revenue Rights]]
		- `congestion rent`
			- if there's congestion, the cheapest seller sells as much as physically possible, up to the congestion limit on its output line.  
				- Its price is it's what it bid
				- not the most expensive power on the market
				- same for more expensive bidders
				- **result**: there's a range of price for serving total generation.
			- however, the buyer always pays the highest price of generation
			- so ERCOT chargers consumers more in total to satisfy load than it charges generators.  This excess money is `congestion rent`
		- this rent is used to fund [[2. ERCOT the Market#CRR: Congestion Revenue Rights auction|CRR: Congestion Revenue Rights]]
			- I'm not sure what that does
	- Transmission losses
		- ERCOT doesn't include transmission loss cost in its LMP, unlike other in other markegs
		- instead, losses are "added to the load"
		- so it accounts for losses but doesn't price them separately
	- LMP vs. settlement point prices
		- wholesale energy prices determined by LMP
		- twofold definition of where prices are deteremed
			- LMP is calculated at the electrical bus of each resource node
			- But wholesale prices are calculated at settlement point prices
- LMP --> Settlement point price  ^krp8
	- DAM settlement
		- at a load zone
			- need a price for each hour; LMPs calculated at each hour
			- Resource Node LMP just the LMP at the resources electrical bus
			- Load zone price
				- load-weighted average of LMPs within the load zone
				- `load distribution actor`: % of load zone load on its bus
		- at a hub
			- hub: grouping of 345 kV substations
			- 3 kinds of settlements points (I think)
				- `Hub average`
					- hub LMP: simple average of LMPs on its Busses
				- `Hub average hub`
					- average of LMPs of N, S, W, Houston hubs (no panhandle)
				- `Bus average hub`
					- average of the 345 kV bus LMPs  in N, S, W, Houston 
					- hubs (no panhandle)
			- when no congestion, same price everywhere?  See [[#^o7vr|congestion rights]]
	- RTM settlement
		- LMPs every *5 minutes*
		- but real-time settlement is every *15 minutes*
		- `settlement price` = "time-weighted average" of 5 min LMPs + a 5 min reserve price adder (averaged over 15 min interval, apparently occur @ 5 min intervals)
			- `online reserve price adder`: additional value of having reserves available for dispatch, every 5 minutes
		- Resource node settlement:
			- mean(LMP + reserve price) over 5 min intervals, up to 15 min
		- Load zone settlement
			- each bus has its own LMP (5 min)
			- average down to 15 mins
			- then add reserve price (15 min average)
		- Hub settlement
			- compute hub LMP 15 min average for each hub bus
			- average across hub buses
			- add 15 min average settlement price
