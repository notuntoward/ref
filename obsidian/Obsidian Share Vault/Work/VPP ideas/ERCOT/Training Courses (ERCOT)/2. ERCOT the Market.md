# Congestion Management
- cost of congestion management: cheapest generators not used
- manifests as price separation between ERCOT poings
- financial instruments manage these costs

- must be represented by some QSE
- can buy/sell power to RE or consumer
- can be a competitive retailer
- can also be a Muni Utility or Electric cooperative (serves areas where no retail choice)
- contracts w/ load consumers
### QSE: Qualified Serving Entity
- kind of a 3 way interface hub between LSE, ERCOT and RE.  I'm not sure why this is necessary, though.
- interacts w/ ERCOT (almost all ERCOT interfaces)
- interacts w/ LSE
- sends instructions to RE
- Does transactions, settles w/ ERCOT
- don't have to represent load or generation at all
### CRR acct. holder

### RE: Resource Entity

- generators, consumers that can do neg. AS
- must be rep. by QSE
- gives ERCOT telemetry
- provides ERCOT all tech capabilities, outages too
### TSP: transmissions service provider
- operates, maintains all lines above 60 KV
- sends ERCOT telemetry, modelling data
- works w/ ERCOT to make power sys work.
### DSP: distribution service provider
- energy --> consumers
- operates all lines < 60 KV
- consumers call DSP w/ service problems
- installs/reads electric meters
### Consumer
- end user: all of them (26 M of them)
- have meters
- contract w/ LSE
- 75% (8M) can choose a power retailer competitively
- Munis or Coops don't have to provide competition in their areas
### ERCOT
- manages 90% of electricity flow in TX, is regulated by PUC
- talks to TSP and QSE
- Responsibilities
	- sys reliability
