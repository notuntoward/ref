# Which ERCOT Training Courses?

- Specializations I, as an Â [Energy Storage Resource (ESR)](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/in-the-ercot-electricity-marke-SGwqJTPsSbuTQZsjMDf.EA#0), should take, according to [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/in-the-ercot-electricity-marke-SGwqJTPsSbuTQZsjMDf.EA#1), in order of priority:
	1. **QSE-R**: Qualified Scheduling Entity Serving Resources trading, etc.
	2. **RE**: Resource Entity
	3. **LSE**: Load Serving Entity (also seems relevant based on perplexity's explanation, even though it didn't recommend it.
-  [Courses Recommendations](https://www.ercot.com/services/training/recommendations), Looks like I should take almost all course, except the one on Retail Markets
