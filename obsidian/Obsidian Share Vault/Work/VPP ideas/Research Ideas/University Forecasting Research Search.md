## Check Bill Gates, MS and AWS for research partners

## look at Georgia Tech
- From research proposal JonL sent me: [[Proposal docs for battery optimization]]
	- high dim forecasts look interesting.  
	- Their paper: 
	- [Good page](https://www.ai4opt.org/end-end-learning-and-optimization) on their neural optimization
- From meeting: [[2024-04-12#AI4OPT Meeting]]
	- they do very fast market simulations:  **PRICE CURVES!**
