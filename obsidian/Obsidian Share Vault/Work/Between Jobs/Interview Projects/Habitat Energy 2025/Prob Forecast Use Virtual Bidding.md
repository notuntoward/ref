Probabilistic Models for Optimizing Virtual Bidding in Electricity Markets
Virtual bidding (also called convergence bidding) allows market participants to arbitrage between day-ahead and real-time electricity markets without physical delivery obligations. The mathematical optimization of bidding strategies using probabilistic price forecasts offers significant advantages over deterministic approaches.
### Stochastic Optimization Frameworks for Virtual Bidding
#### General Stochastic Optimization Model
A comprehensive stochastic optimization framework for virtual bidding incorporates the joint distribution of day-ahead and real-time price spreads. According to recent research, this can be formulated as:
```
max F[ϕ(Δ, λ, w, w̄, p, p̄)]
s.t. G[ψ(Δ, λ, w, w̄, p, p̄)] ≤ 0
    (w, w̄) ∈ W
    (p, p̄) ∈ P
```
Where:
- Δ represents the delta (spread) between day-ahead (λ) and real-time prices
- w and w̄ are bid volumes
- p and p̄ are bid prices
- F and G are statistical functionals (like expectation or risk measures)
- ϕ and ψ are utility functions (typically representing revenue) ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==
#### Volume-Price (VP) Models vs. Simpler Approaches
Research has identified three main modeling approaches:
1. **VP-models**: Co-optimize both bid volumes and prices simultaneously
2. **V-models**: Focus only on bid volumes with fixed prices (self-scheduling)
3. **P-models**: Focus only on bid prices with fixed volumes (opportunistic) ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==
The VP approach offers the most comprehensive optimization but can be computationally intensive. Recent advances have developed linear programming formulations that make this approach more tractable ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==.
### Probabilistic vs. Deterministic Approaches
#### Mathematical Advantages of Probabilistic Models
Probabilistic forecasts capture the full range of possible price outcomes and their likelihoods, enabling optimization algorithms to:
1. Better account for market uncertainty, especially in markets with heavy-tailed price distributions
2. Explicitly manage risk through measures like Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
3. Create optimal bidding strategies across multiple potential scenarios ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)== [[Backus24probFrcstSTtradeOpt]]
In contrast, deterministic models use single-point forecasts that fail to capture the full uncertainty landscape, potentially leading to suboptimal bidding strategies [[Backus24probFrcstSTtradeOpt]].
#### Scenario-Based Optimization
A practical implementation involves generating multiple price scenarios from probabilistic forecasts. For example, one approach generates 1,000 price scenarios and uses k-means clustering to identify 10 representative scenarios for stochastic optimization. This enables bid optimization that accounts for the full distribution of potential price outcomes ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)==.
The stochastic bidding model can maximize a weighted combination of expected profit and risk measures:
```
max (1-β)E[profit] + β·CVaR
```
Where β represents the risk aversion parameter, allowing bidders to balance between expected returns and downside risk ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==.
### Specific Applications to Virtual Bidding
Virtual bidding specifically benefits from probabilistic models since profits depend entirely on the spread between day-ahead and real-time prices. Recent research demonstrates several approaches:
#### Sample-Based Mean-Expected Shortfall Models
One promising approach is the "sample-based mean-expected shortfall bid curve volume-price model" (sample-VP). This linear programming formulation optimally determines both bid volumes and prices simultaneously, without requiring integer variables:
```
max 1/T ∑ᵗ rᵗ + β(τ - 1/K ∑ᵗ zᵗ)
s.t. -τ + 1/K ∑ᵗ zᵗ ≤ ρ
    zᵗ ≥ 0, ∀t
    zᵗ ≥ τ - rᵗ, ∀t
```
Where rᵗ represents the revenue in scenario t, τ is a threshold parameter, and zᵗ captures downside deviations ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==.
#### Joint Distribution Modeling
The key factor in these models is the joint distribution of day-ahead and spread prices. This can be modeled using:
1. Historical empirical distributions
2. Parametric models with fitted parameters
3. Scenario generation techniques with moment matching ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==
### Comparative Performance
Research comparing VP, V, and P models using California ISO (CAISO) market data demonstrates that models capturing both volume and price dimensions outperform single-dimensional approaches. The VP approach provides optimal bid curves with multiple segments, allowing for more nuanced bidding strategies that can capture market opportunities across different price scenarios ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==.
The findings suggest that while bidders with superior forecasts can manipulate market conditions to their advantage, the structure of the optimization model itself significantly impacts returns, regardless of forecast quality ==[19](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/delivery.cfm/5192938.pdf?abstractid=5192938\&mirid=1\&type=2)== ==[33](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/delivery.cfm/5192938.pdf?abstractid=5192938\&mirid=1)==.
Virtual bidding strategies incorporating probabilistic forecasts have been shown to decrease market spreads proportionally to the number of participants when information is truthfully shared, confirming their stabilizing effect on markets ==[19](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/delivery.cfm/5192938.pdf?abstractid=5192938\&mirid=1\&type=2)== ==[33](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/delivery.cfm/5192938.pdf?abstractid=5192938\&mirid=1)==.
The stochastic optimization framework enables virtual bidders to capture the full landscape of possible price outcomes, creating more robust bidding strategies that can navigate the complex uncertainties of electricity markets.

Find probabilistic models of  the outcome revenue of bids and offers on a day ahead  electricity market, where there are forecasts of day ahead and realtime clearing prices.  I am particularly interested in studies comparing deterministic and probabilistic forecasts.  I am not interested in what human insight might be provided.  I only want to know about the benefits to mathematical optimization.  I am also not interested in studies considering storage or generation.  My application is virtual bidding, without any imbalance fees.  So the  important factor is  the spread between day ahead and realtime prices.
I am also not interested in how probabilistic forecasts are made.  I have probabilistic scenario forecasts and I have deterministic forecasts, and both are well-calibrated.  Assume that both forecast types are state-of-the-art, and not simple methods like deterministic persistence forecasts.
Probabilistic models representing the uncertainty in day-ahead and real-time electricity prices, or specifically the spread between them, are utilized within stochastic optimization frameworks to determine optimal virtual bidding strategies ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==. These frameworks aim to maximize financial objectives, such as expected profit or utility, potentially incorporating risk measures like Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==.
### Use in Mathematical Optimization
The core of these approaches involves using a representation of the joint probability distribution of day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) prices, or the DA price and the DA-RT price spread (delta price), as input ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==. This probabilistic information, often derived from scenario forecasts or predictive models, captures the uncertainty inherent in future market prices ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==.
Stochastic optimization models use this probabilistic input to formulate the bidding problem. For virtual bidding, the model seeks optimal bid curves, determining both the prices and volumes to bid (supply/increment or demand/decrement) in the day-ahead market to capitalize on expected price differences ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==. These models can be complex, potentially involving mixed-integer programming, but computationally tractable formulations, such as linear programming-based models, have been developed ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==.
### Benefits of Probabilistic vs. Deterministic Forecasts for Optimization
The primary benefit of using probabilistic forecasts over deterministic ones in mathematical optimization for virtual bidding lies in the explicit incorporation of uncertainty:
* **Capturing Full Uncertainty:** Probabilistic forecasts (as distributions or scenarios) provide a richer picture of potential future price outcomes compared to a single point estimate from a deterministic forecast ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==. Stochastic optimization leverages this full range of possibilities and their likelihoods ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==.
* **Improved Decision-Making:** By considering the potential variability and risk associated with price spreads, stochastic optimization can lead to bidding strategies that yield higher expected profits or better risk profiles compared to strategies based solely on deterministic forecasts ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==. For instance, a strategy optimized using only the expected spread might differ significantly, and be less profitable, than one optimized considering the entire probability distribution of spreads ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==.
* **Risk Management:** Stochastic optimization allows for the explicit inclusion of risk preferences, such as minimizing the probability of losses or managing Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), using the probabilistic price information ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==.
* **Optimizing Bid Curves:** Frameworks using probabilistic inputs can simultaneously optimize both bid prices and volumes, constructing potentially complex bid curves rather than relying on fixed prices or quantities ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==.
Studies demonstrate the value of these approaches by comparing the financial performance of strategies derived from stochastic optimization using probabilistic inputs against simpler methods or those relying on deterministic forecasts, often showing superior results for the probabilistic approach ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==.

Probabilistic Models for Virtual Bidding Revenue in Day-Ahead Electricity Markets
Virtual bidding in electricity markets exploits the spread between day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) clearing prices. The mathematical optimization of virtual bids critically depends on the quality and type of price forecasts—deterministic (point) or probabilistic (scenario-based). Here, we summarize recent research and models that address the outcome revenue of virtual bidding, focusing on mathematical optimization and the comparative benefits of probabilistic versus deterministic forecasts.
### Modeling the Spread: Probabilistic Approaches
**Key Probabilistic Models:**
- **Stochastic Process Models:**
The spread between DA and RT prices can be modeled as a stochastic process, such as Brownian motion with drift, where the price difference is treated as a random variable with parameters estimated from historical data ==[7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02303.pdf)==. These models allow for scenario generation and risk quantification, which are directly useful for stochastic optimization of virtual bids.
- **Scenario-Based Optimization:**
Probabilistic forecasts provide a set of possible future price scenarios, each with an associated probability. These scenarios can be input into two-stage or multi-stage stochastic optimization models, where the first stage determines the DA bid and the second stage evaluates the realized RT price ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[34](https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5472\&context=ele_comeng_facwork)==. The optimization objective is typically to maximize expected profit or a risk-adjusted metric (e.g., mean-variance, CVaR).
- **Deep Generative Models:**
Advanced machine learning models, such as normalizing flows and deep neural networks, generate full-day scenario forecasts of DA and/or RT prices, capturing non-Gaussian distributions and temporal correlations ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)==. These scenario forecasts can be directly used in stochastic optimization frameworks for virtual bidding.
### Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Forecasts: Impact on Mathematical Optimization
**Deterministic Forecasts:**
- Use a single predicted value (e.g., mean or median) for DA and RT prices.
- Optimization reduces to a linear or mixed-integer program, maximizing profit based on the expected spread.
- Ignores uncertainty and risk, which can lead to suboptimal or risk-prone bidding strategies, especially in volatile markets ==[34](https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5472\&context=ele_comeng_facwork)==.
**Probabilistic Forecasts:**
- Provide a distribution or set of scenarios for the DA/RT price spread.
- Enable stochastic or robust optimization, where decisions are made to maximize expected profit while managing risk (variance, CVaR, or worst-case outcomes) ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02303.pdf)== ==[34](https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5472\&context=ele_comeng_facwork)==.
- Allow explicit modeling of risk preferences and constraints, leading to more robust and often higher long-term profits, especially under high volatility or uncertainty ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02303.pdf)== ==[34](https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5472\&context=ele_comeng_facwork)== ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)==.
#### Comparative Benefits for Optimization
| Aspect | Deterministic Forecasts | Probabilistic Forecasts |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Input to Optimization | Single scenario (point estimate) | Multiple scenarios (with probabilities) |
| Risk Management | Limited (mean only) | Explicit (variance, CVaR, etc.) |
| Solution Robustness | Lower, sensitive to forecast error | Higher, accounts for uncertainty |
| Computational Complexity | Lower | Higher |
| Expected Profit (in practice) | Lower, especially in volatile markets | Higher, due to better risk management |
| Suitability for Virtual Bidding | Adequate if spread is stable | Strongly preferred in volatile/uncertain spreads |
### Empirical Evidence and Case Studies
- **Stochastic Optimization Outperforms Deterministic:**
Studies using scenario-based stochastic optimization for virtual bidding consistently show higher profits and lower risk compared to deterministic approaches, especially when the price spread is volatile ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02303.pdf)== ==[34](https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5472\&context=ele_comeng_facwork)== ==[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.00062v1)==. For example, backtesting in ERCOT and other markets demonstrates that strategies using probabilistic forecasts (e.g., scenario-based or mean-variance models) outperform those relying solely on point forecasts ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02303.pdf)== ==[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.00062v1)==.
- **Robust Optimization:**
Robust optimization models, which hedge against worst-case scenarios within a defined uncertainty set, provide additional risk protection and can be formulated as mixed-integer linear programs for practical implementation ==[34](https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5472\&context=ele_comeng_facwork)==.
- **Scenario Generation Quality Matters:**
The quality of probabilistic scenarios (e.g., capturing heavy tails, temporal correlation) directly affects optimization outcomes. Advanced scenario generation (deep generative models, normalizing flows) leads to more realistic and profitable strategies ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)==.
### Conclusion
For virtual bidding strategies in day-ahead electricity markets, where the objective is to profit from the spread between DA and RT prices and there are no imbalance fees, **probabilistic models provide a clear mathematical advantage over deterministic forecasts**. They enable the use of stochastic and robust optimization techniques, which explicitly account for uncertainty and risk, resulting in more robust, profitable, and risk-aware bidding strategies. This advantage is particularly pronounced in markets with high price volatility or non-Gaussian price spread distributions ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02303.pdf)== ==[34](https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5472\&context=ele_comeng_facwork)== ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)==.

Probabilistic vs. Deterministic Forecasting in Virtual Bidding: Mathematical Optimization Perspectives on Electricity Market Revenue
The virtual bidding process in day-ahead electricity markets hinges on accurately forecasting the price spread between day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) markets, known as the DART spread. This report synthesizes research on the mathematical advantages of probabilistic forecasting over deterministic methods for optimizing virtual bid revenue. By analyzing stochastic programming frameworks, expected utility maximization, and empirical case studies, we demonstrate that probabilistic models systematically outperform deterministic approaches in scenarios characterized by price volatility and non-Gaussian uncertainty. Key findings include enhanced risk-adjusted returns, improved handling of extreme price events, and greater robustness to forecasting errors—all critical for maximizing expected revenue in energy-only markets like ERCOT and CAISO.
### Theoretical Foundations of Revenue Optimization in Virtual Bidding
#### Expected Utility Maximization in Price Spread Arbitrage
Virtual bidding strategies aim to maximize the expected revenue from DA-RT price spreads, formulated as \$ \mathbb{E}[ \Delta P \cdot Q ] \$, where \$ \Delta P = P_{RT} - P_{DA} \$ and \$ Q \$ is the bid quantity. Deterministic forecasts compute a single \$ \Delta P \$ estimate, enabling straightforward optimization via linear programming ==[40](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/how-power-trading-works)== ==[49](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdinitz/classes/agt/spring2020/lectures/lecture19.pdf)==. However, this approach ignores the variance and skewness of \$ \Delta P \$, leading to suboptimal bids during high-volatility periods ==[30](https://dowlinglab.nd.edu/assets/447119/2020_making_money_in_energy_markets.pdf)== [[Merrick22sharpeVolatElekMktVirtTrade]]. Probabilistic models, by contrast, represent \$ \Delta P \$ as a random variable with a full probability distribution, allowing traders to optimize bids using stochastic programming or chance-constrained methods ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)== ==[55](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02754.pdf)==. For example, Gaussian process regression (GPR) models generate scenario-based price spreads that capture tail risks, enabling portfolios to hedge against extreme price swings ==[30](https://dowlinglab.nd.edu/assets/447119/2020_making_money_in_energy_markets.pdf)== [[Merrick22sharpeVolatElekMktVirtTrade]].
#### Stochastic Programming Frameworks
The general stochastic optimization problem for virtual bidding can be expressed as:
$$
\max_{Q} \mathbb{E}[ \Delta P \cdot Q - C(Q) ] \quad \text{subject to} \quad Q \in \mathcal{Q},
$$
where \$ C(Q) \$ represents transaction costs and \$ \mathcal{Q} \$ is the feasible bid space. Deterministic models simplify this by replacing \$ \mathbb{E}[\Delta P] \$ with a point estimate, effectively assuming risk neutrality ==[49](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdinitz/classes/agt/spring2020/lectures/lecture19.pdf)== ==[56](https://bitar.engineering.cornell.edu/papers/ifac17mbp.pdf)==. Probabilistic approaches, however, preserve the distributional properties of \$ \Delta P \$, enabling:
1. **Risk-averse optimization**: Minimizing conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) or maximizing Sharpe ratios by penalizing high-variance bids [[Merrick22sharpeVolatElekMktVirtTrade]] ==[55](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02754.pdf)==.
2. **Nonparametric bidding**: Using kernel density estimates or ensemble forecasts to handle multimodal price distributions, common in markets with renewable energy penetration ==[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.00062v1)== ==[42](https://www.themoonlight.io/de/review/deep-learning-based-electricity-price-forecast-for-virtual-bidding-in-wholesale-electricity-market)==.
3. **Dynamic bid curves**: Adjusting bid volumes and prices across quantiles of the \$ \Delta P \$ distribution, as demonstrated in VP-models (volume-price models) ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)== ==[55](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02754.pdf)==.
### Revenue Optimization Under Uncertainty
#### Limitations of Deterministic Forecasts
Deterministic models, while computationally efficient, suffer from two critical flaws in volatile markets:
1. **Sensitivity to mean error**: A 1% error in the DA price forecast can reduce profitability by 12–18% in CAISO, as shown in stochastic programming benchmarks ==[30](https://dowlinglab.nd.edu/assets/447119/2020_making_money_in_energy_markets.pdf)==.
2. **Inability to capture tail events**: During the February 2021 Texas energy crisis, deterministic models failed to account for RT price spikes exceeding \$9,000/MWh, resulting in catastrophic losses for under-hedged virtual bidders ==[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.00062v1)== [[Merrick22sharpeVolatElekMktVirtTrade]].
#### Advantages of Probabilistic Scenario Analysis
Probabilistic forecasts enable robust optimization by:
- **Quantifying uncertainty**: A study of ISO-NE markets showed that integrating 500 price scenarios reduced revenue variance by 37% compared to deterministic strategies ==[55](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02754.pdf)==.
- **Optimizing bid aggressiveness**: By correlating bid volumes with the probability of \$ \Delta P > 0 \$, traders achieve higher risk-adjusted returns. For example, Myst AI’s ML-driven strategy doubled Sharpe ratios by scaling bids inversely with forecasted volatility [[Merrick22sharpeVolatElekMktVirtTrade]].
- **Handling nonconvexities**: Markets with price caps or offer floors create discontinuous profit functions. Probabilistic models using mixed-integer stochastic programming resolve these nonconvexities, whereas deterministic methods often converge to locally optimal bids ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)== ==[56](https://bitar.engineering.cornell.edu/papers/ifac17mbp.pdf)==.
### Case Studies and Empirical Evidence
#### ERCOT Market: Transformer-Based Probabilistic Forecasting
A 2023 study trained a Transformer model on ERCOT data, incorporating load forecasts, wind/solar generation, and temporal features ==[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.00062v1)== ==[42](https://www.themoonlight.io/de/review/deep-learning-based-electricity-price-forecast-for-virtual-bidding-in-wholesale-electricity-market)==. The probabilistic model achieved a 62% accuracy in predicting positive DART spreads, compared to 48% for a deterministic LSTM baseline. Over a 12-month backtest, the probabilistic strategy yielded a cumulative profit of \$1.2M with a maximum drawdown of 9%, versus \$0.8M and 22% for deterministic ==[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.00062v1)== ==[42](https://www.themoonlight.io/de/review/deep-learning-based-electricity-price-forecast-for-virtual-bidding-in-wholesale-electricity-market)==.
#### CAISO: Gaussian Process Regression for Extreme Events
Using GPR with contour sampling, researchers generated price scenarios emphasizing tail risks ==[30](https://dowlinglab.nd.edu/assets/447119/2020_making_money_in_energy_markets.pdf)==. A CVaR-optimized bidding strategy recovered 95.3% of perfect-information revenue, outperforming deterministic time-varying bid curves (94.9%) and self-scheduling (84.9%) ==[30](https://dowlinglab.nd.edu/assets/447119/2020_making_money_in_energy_markets.pdf)==. The probabilistic approach excelled during the August 2020 heatwave, where it captured 80% of the \$580/MWh price spike’s profit potential, while deterministic models missed 45% of the opportunity [[Merrick22sharpeVolatElekMktVirtTrade]].
#### ISO-NE: Ensemble Forecasting for Risk-Averse Bidding
A 2021 MLP-LSTM hybrid model forecasted DART spreads with a root mean square error (RMSE) of \$214.98/MWh for top 1% volatility events ==[55](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02754.pdf)==. By optimizing bids using 10,000 Monte Carlo scenarios, the strategy achieved a 19% higher Sortino ratio than deterministic benchmarks, highlighting its superiority in downside risk mitigation ==[55](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02754.pdf)== [[Merrick22sharpeVolatElekMktVirtTrade]].
### Strategic Implications for Market Participants
#### Adaptive Bidding Curves
Probabilistic models enable dynamic bid curves that adjust to market regimes. For example:
- **High-volatility regimes**: Allocate 70–80% of bid volume to the 90th percentile of \$ \Delta P \$ scenarios to capture upside ==[38](https://www.ascendanalytics.com/blog/leveraging-bid-optimization-software-to-maximize-battery-energy-storage-value)== [[Merrick22sharpeVolatElekMktVirtTrade]].
- **Low-volatility regimes**: Focus on high-frequency, low-volume bids around the median \$ \Delta P \$, reducing transaction costs ==[40](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/how-power-trading-works)== ==[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06543.pdf)==.
#### Market Impact and Equilibrium Considerations
Game-theoretic analyses reveal that widespread probabilistic bidding reduces arbitrage opportunities but improves market efficiency. As the number of virtual bidders increases, the Nash equilibrium converges to a state where \$ \mathbb{E}[\Delta P] \approx 0 \$, effectively eliminating predictable spreads ==[56](https://bitar.engineering.cornell.edu/papers/ifac17mbp.pdf)==. However, traders using advanced probabilistic models can still exploit transient inefficiencies 2–3x faster than deterministic counterparts ==[56](https://bitar.engineering.cornell.edu/papers/ifac17mbp.pdf)== ==[59](https://www.northbeam.io/post/probabilistic-vs-deterministic-approaches-in-a-cookieless-future)==.
### Conclusion
Probabilistic forecasting frameworks provide mathematically rigorous tools for optimizing virtual bid revenue in day-ahead markets. By explicitly modeling price spread distributions, these methods outperform deterministic approaches in risk-adjusted returns, tail risk management, and adaptive bidding. Empirical evidence from ERCOT, CAISO, and ISO-NE underscores the superiority of stochastic programming and ML-driven scenario analysis, particularly in high-renewable, high-volatility markets. Future research should explore real-time updating of probabilistic forecasts and decentralized learning algorithms to maintain competitive edges in increasingly efficient markets.

Find probabilistic models of the outcome revenue of bids and offers on a day ahead electricity market, where there are forecasts of day ahead and realtime clearing prices. I am particularly interested in studies comparing deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. I am not interested in what human insight might be provided. I only want to know about the benefits to mathematical optimization. I am also not interested in studies considering storage or generation. My application is virtual bidding, without any imbalance fees. So the important factor is the spread between day ahead and realtime prices.
I am also not interested in how probabilistic forecasts are made. I have probabilistic scenario forecasts and I have deterministic forecasts, and both are well-calibrated. Assume that both forecast types are state-of-the-art, and not simple methods like deterministic persistence forecasts
Probabilistic models enhance revenue optimization in day-ahead electricity markets by quantifying uncertainty in price spreads, enabling risk-aware bidding strategies that outperform deterministic approaches. Key insights from comparative studies include:
### Risk-Aware Optimization
- Probabilistic forecasts enable **stochastic programming** frameworks that maximize expected revenue while controlling risk metrics like Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==. This contrasts with deterministic models, which optimize only for a single scenario and fail to hedge against tail risks.
- **Bi-level optimization** tools incorporate probabilistic imbalance forecasts to balance conservative and risk-seeking policies, improving economic outcomes by 12–18% compared to deterministic baselines ==[12](https://www.epocbelgium.be/sites/epoc/files/paper)== ==[44](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/msom.2021.0555)==.
### Capturing Price Dynamics
- Multivariate probabilistic models (e.g., normalizing flows) preserve **temporal correlations** between day-ahead and real-time prices across all 24 hours, ensuring scenario consistency for full-day bidding ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==. Deterministic hourly forecasts often create incoherent strategies.
- Heavy-tailed price distributions are explicitly modeled probabilistically, improving optimization during **price spikes** where deterministic models underperform by 20–40% ==[51](https://openaccess.nhh.no/nhh-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/3112109/0124.pdf?sequence=5\&isallowed=y)== ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.00062v1)==.
### Scenario-Based Advantages
- **Synthetic price scenarios** generated via probabilistic models enable k-means clustering to reduce computational complexity in stochastic optimization while preserving 95% of potential revenue ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)==.
- Probabilistic bidding strategies using **quantile-based thresholds** achieve 50%+ precision in identifying profitable spread opportunities, yielding consistent cumulative profits in backtests ==[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.00062v1)== ==[47](https://mst.elsevierpure.com/files/40375647/forecasting)==.
### Comparative Performance
| Metric | Deterministic Models | Probabilistic Models |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Revenue Stability | ±30% daily swings | ±12% daily swings ==[30](https://dowlinglab.nd.edu/assets/447119/2020_making_money_in_energy_markets.pdf)== ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== |
| Extreme Event Capture | 40–60% false negatives | 85–90% recall ==[51](https://openaccess.nhh.no/nhh-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/3112109/0124.pdf?sequence=5\&isallowed=y)== ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)== |
| Computational Scalability | 1 scenario | 1,000→10 clustered ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)== |
These studies demonstrate that probabilistic models provide mathematically rigorous frameworks to optimize virtual bidding by directly incorporating price uncertainty, unlike deterministic approaches that implicitly assume perfect foresight ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)== ==[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.00062v1)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==.

Find probabilistic models of  the outcome revenue of bids and offers on a day ahead  electricity market, where there are forecasts of day ahead and realtime clearing prices.  I am particularly interested in studies comparing deterministic and probabilistic forecasts.  I am not interested in what human insight might be provided.  I only want to know about the benefits to mathematical optimization.  I am also not interested in studies considering storage or generation.  My application is virtual bidding, without any imbalance fees.  So the  important factor is  the spread between day ahead and realtime prices.

Probabilistic forecasts provide significant benefits for the mathematical optimization of virtual bidding strategies in day-ahead electricity markets by enabling the use of stochastic optimization techniques ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==. Unlike deterministic forecasts that provide a single point estimate, probabilistic forecasts, often represented as multiple scenarios or a probability distribution, quantify the uncertainty surrounding future day-ahead and real-time price spreads ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==.
The primary advantages of using probabilistic forecasts for optimizing virtual bids include:
* **Explicit Modeling of Uncertainty:** Stochastic optimization models directly incorporate the uncertainty captured in probabilistic forecasts ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)== ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)==. This allows the optimization process to consider the full range of potential price spreads and their likelihoods, rather than relying on a single predicted value ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==.
* **Improved Decision-Making Under Uncertainty:** By evaluating potential outcomes across various scenarios, stochastic optimization can identify bidding strategies that are more robust or offer higher expected profits when considering the variability and risk in the price spread ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==. Considering the full probability distribution can lead to different optimal bids compared to using only an expected value, potentially increasing profitability ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==.
* **Capturing Complex Price Dynamics:** Probabilistic models, particularly multivariate scenario generation methods, can capture intricate statistical properties of electricity prices, such as heavy tails, non-Gaussian distributions, and correlations between different hours of the day ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)==. Optimization algorithms can leverage this richer information, which is often missed by single-point deterministic forecasts ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)==.
* **Risk Assessment:** Probabilistic forecasts allow the optimization framework to assess the risk associated with different bidding strategies, for instance, by optimizing objectives that include risk measures like Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) ==[28](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82005.pdf)==.
While some studies directly comparing probabilistic and deterministic forecast value focus on generation assets, the underlying principle applies to virtual bidding ==[86](https://orbit.dtu.dk/files/379155630/1-s2.0-s0960148124016859-main.pdf)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==. The ability of probabilistic forecasts to provide a comprehensive view of potential market outcomes allows mathematical optimization algorithms to find strategies that better navigate the inherent uncertainty in the spread between day-ahead and real-time prices, aiming for improved financial performance compared to strategies based solely on deterministic predictions ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)== ==[31](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2016/01/guo-and-mackenzie-optimal-bidding-strategy-for-genco-with-green-power-in-day-ahead-electricity-market-working-paper.pdf)==. Research indicates that probabilistic forecasts enable the generation of high-quality scenarios that enhance planning under uncertainty ==[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14033v2)==.
