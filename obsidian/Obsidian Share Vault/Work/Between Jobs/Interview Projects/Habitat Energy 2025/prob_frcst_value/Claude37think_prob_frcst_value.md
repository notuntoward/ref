## Probabilistic Models for Optimizing Virtual Bidding in Electricity Markets

Virtual bidding (also called convergence bidding) allows market participants to arbitrage between day-ahead and real-time electricity markets without physical delivery obligations. The mathematical optimization of bidding strategies using probabilistic price forecasts offers significant advantages over deterministic approaches.

## Stochastic Optimization Frameworks for Virtual Bidding

### General Stochastic Optimization Model

A comprehensive stochastic optimization framework for virtual bidding incorporates the joint distribution of day-ahead and real-time price spreads. According to recent research, this can be formulated as:

```
max F[ϕ(Δ, λ, w, w̄, p, p̄)]
s.t. G[ψ(Δ, λ, w, w̄, p, p̄)] ≤ 0
    (w, w̄) ∈ W
    (p, p̄) ∈ P
```

Where:

- Δ represents the delta (spread) between day-ahead (λ) and real-time prices
- w and w̄ are bid volumes
- p and p̄ are bid prices
- F and G are statistical functionals (like expectation or risk measures)
- ϕ and ψ are utility functions (typically representing revenue)[^2]


### Volume-Price (VP) Models vs. Simpler Approaches

Research has identified three main modeling approaches:

1. **VP-models**: Co-optimize both bid volumes and prices simultaneously
2. **V-models**: Focus only on bid volumes with fixed prices (self-scheduling)
3. **P-models**: Focus only on bid prices with fixed volumes (opportunistic)[^2]

The VP approach offers the most comprehensive optimization but can be computationally intensive. Recent advances have developed linear programming formulations that make this approach more tractable[^2].

## Probabilistic vs. Deterministic Approaches

### Mathematical Advantages of Probabilistic Models

Probabilistic forecasts capture the full range of possible price outcomes and their likelihoods, enabling optimization algorithms to:

1. Better account for market uncertainty, especially in markets with heavy-tailed price distributions
2. Explicitly manage risk through measures like Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
3. Create optimal bidding strategies across multiple potential scenarios[^1][^2][^5]

In contrast, deterministic models use single-point forecasts that fail to capture the full uncertainty landscape, potentially leading to suboptimal bidding strategies[^5].

### Scenario-Based Optimization

A practical implementation involves generating multiple price scenarios from probabilistic forecasts. For example, one approach generates 1,000 price scenarios and uses k-means clustering to identify 10 representative scenarios for stochastic optimization. This enables bid optimization that accounts for the full distribution of potential price outcomes[^1].

The stochastic bidding model can maximize a weighted combination of expected profit and risk measures:

```
max (1-β)E[profit] + β·CVaR
```

Where β represents the risk aversion parameter, allowing bidders to balance between expected returns and downside risk[^1][^2].

## Specific Applications to Virtual Bidding

Virtual bidding specifically benefits from probabilistic models since profits depend entirely on the spread between day-ahead and real-time prices. Recent research demonstrates several approaches:

### Sample-Based Mean-Expected Shortfall Models

One promising approach is the "sample-based mean-expected shortfall bid curve volume-price model" (sample-VP). This linear programming formulation optimally determines both bid volumes and prices simultaneously, without requiring integer variables:

```
max 1/T ∑ᵗ rᵗ + β(τ - 1/K ∑ᵗ zᵗ)
s.t. -τ + 1/K ∑ᵗ zᵗ ≤ ρ
    zᵗ ≥ 0, ∀t
    zᵗ ≥ τ - rᵗ, ∀t
```

Where rᵗ represents the revenue in scenario t, τ is a threshold parameter, and zᵗ captures downside deviations[^2].

### Joint Distribution Modeling

The key factor in these models is the joint distribution of day-ahead and spread prices. This can be modeled using:

1. Historical empirical distributions
2. Parametric models with fitted parameters
3. Scenario generation techniques with moment matching[^2]

## Comparative Performance

Research comparing VP, V, and P models using California ISO (CAISO) market data demonstrates that models capturing both volume and price dimensions outperform single-dimensional approaches. The VP approach provides optimal bid curves with multiple segments, allowing for more nuanced bidding strategies that can capture market opportunities across different price scenarios[^2].

The findings suggest that while bidders with superior forecasts can manipulate market conditions to their advantage, the structure of the optimization model itself significantly impacts returns, regardless of forecast quality[^3][^4].

Virtual bidding strategies incorporating probabilistic forecasts have been shown to decrease market spreads proportionally to the number of participants when information is truthfully shared, confirming their stabilizing effect on markets[^3][^4].

The stochastic optimization framework enables virtual bidders to capture the full landscape of possible price outcomes, creating more robust bidding strategies that can navigate the complex uncertainties of electricity markets.
