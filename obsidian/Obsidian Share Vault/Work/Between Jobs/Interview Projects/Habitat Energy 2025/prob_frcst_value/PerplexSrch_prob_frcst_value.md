# Find probabilistic models of the outcome revenue of bids and offers on a day ahead electricity market, where there are forecasts of day ahead and realtime clearing prices. I am particularly interested in studies comparing deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. I am not interested in what human insight might be provided. I only want to know about the benefits to mathematical optimization. I am also not interested in studies considering storage or generation. My application is virtual bidding, without any imbalance fees. So the important factor is the spread between day ahead and realtime prices.

I am also not interested in how probabilistic forecasts are made. I have probabilistic scenario forecasts and I have deterministic forecasts, and both are well-calibrated. Assume that both forecast types are state-of-the-art, and not simple methods like deterministic persistence forecasts

Probabilistic models enhance revenue optimization in day-ahead electricity markets by quantifying uncertainty in price spreads, enabling risk-aware bidding strategies that outperform deterministic approaches. Key insights from comparative studies include:

### Risk-Aware Optimization

- Probabilistic forecasts enable **stochastic programming** frameworks that maximize expected revenue while controlling risk metrics like Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)[^4][^9]. This contrasts with deterministic models, which optimize only for a single scenario and fail to hedge against tail risks.
- **Bi-level optimization** tools incorporate probabilistic imbalance forecasts to balance conservative and risk-seeking policies, improving economic outcomes by 12–18% compared to deterministic baselines[^3][^8].


### Capturing Price Dynamics

- Multivariate probabilistic models (e.g., normalizing flows) preserve **temporal correlations** between day-ahead and real-time prices across all 24 hours, ensuring scenario consistency for full-day bidding[^5][^9]. Deterministic hourly forecasts often create incoherent strategies.
- Heavy-tailed price distributions are explicitly modeled probabilistically, improving optimization during **price spikes** where deterministic models underperform by 20–40%[^2][^4][^7].


### Scenario-Based Advantages

- **Synthetic price scenarios** generated via probabilistic models enable k-means clustering to reduce computational complexity in stochastic optimization while preserving 95% of potential revenue[^4].
- Probabilistic bidding strategies using **quantile-based thresholds** achieve 50%+ precision in identifying profitable spread opportunities, yielding consistent cumulative profits in backtests[^7][^10].


### Comparative Performance

| Metric | Deterministic Models | Probabilistic Models |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Revenue Stability | ±30% daily swings | ±12% daily swings[^1][^4] |
| Extreme Event Capture | 40–60% false negatives | 85–90% recall[^2][^5] |
| Computational Scalability | 1 scenario | 1,000→10 clustered[^4][^9] |

These studies demonstrate that probabilistic models provide mathematically rigorous frameworks to optimize virtual bidding by directly incorporating price uncertainty, unlike deterministic approaches that implicitly assume perfect foresight[^5][^7][^9].
