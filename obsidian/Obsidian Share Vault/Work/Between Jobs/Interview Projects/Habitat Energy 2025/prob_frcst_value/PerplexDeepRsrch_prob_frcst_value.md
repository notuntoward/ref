# Probabilistic vs. Deterministic Forecasting in Virtual Bidding: Mathematical Optimization Perspectives on Electricity Market Revenue

The virtual bidding process in day-ahead electricity markets hinges on accurately forecasting the price spread between day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) markets, known as the DART spread. This report synthesizes research on the mathematical advantages of probabilistic forecasting over deterministic methods for optimizing virtual bid revenue. By analyzing stochastic programming frameworks, expected utility maximization, and empirical case studies, we demonstrate that probabilistic models systematically outperform deterministic approaches in scenarios characterized by price volatility and non-Gaussian uncertainty. Key findings include enhanced risk-adjusted returns, improved handling of extreme price events, and greater robustness to forecasting errors—all critical for maximizing expected revenue in energy-only markets like ERCOT and CAISO.

## Theoretical Foundations of Revenue Optimization in Virtual Bidding

### Expected Utility Maximization in Price Spread Arbitrage

Virtual bidding strategies aim to maximize the expected revenue from DA-RT price spreads, formulated as \$ \mathbb{E}[ \Delta P \cdot Q ] \$, where \$ \Delta P = P_{RT} - P_{DA} \$ and \$ Q \$ is the bid quantity. Deterministic forecasts compute a single \$ \Delta P \$ estimate, enabling straightforward optimization via linear programming[^4][^12]. However, this approach ignores the variance and skewness of \$ \Delta P \$, leading to suboptimal bids during high-volatility periods[^8][^11]. Probabilistic models, by contrast, represent \$ \Delta P \$ as a random variable with a full probability distribution, allowing traders to optimize bids using stochastic programming or chance-constrained methods[^10][^16]. For example, Gaussian process regression (GPR) models generate scenario-based price spreads that capture tail risks, enabling portfolios to hedge against extreme price swings[^8][^11].

### Stochastic Programming Frameworks

The general stochastic optimization problem for virtual bidding can be expressed as:

$$
\max_{Q} \mathbb{E}[ \Delta P \cdot Q - C(Q) ] \quad \text{subject to} \quad Q \in \mathcal{Q},
$$

where \$ C(Q) \$ represents transaction costs and \$ \mathcal{Q} \$ is the feasible bid space. Deterministic models simplify this by replacing \$ \mathbb{E}[\Delta P] \$ with a point estimate, effectively assuming risk neutrality[^12][^17]. Probabilistic approaches, however, preserve the distributional properties of \$ \Delta P \$, enabling:

1. **Risk-averse optimization**: Minimizing conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) or maximizing Sharpe ratios by penalizing high-variance bids[^11][^16].
2. **Nonparametric bidding**: Using kernel density estimates or ensemble forecasts to handle multimodal price distributions, common in markets with renewable energy penetration[^1][^5].
3. **Dynamic bid curves**: Adjusting bid volumes and prices across quantiles of the \$ \Delta P \$ distribution, as demonstrated in VP-models (volume-price models)[^10][^16].

## Revenue Optimization Under Uncertainty

### Limitations of Deterministic Forecasts

Deterministic models, while computationally efficient, suffer from two critical flaws in volatile markets:

1. **Sensitivity to mean error**: A 1% error in the DA price forecast can reduce profitability by 12–18% in CAISO, as shown in stochastic programming benchmarks[^8].
2. **Inability to capture tail events**: During the February 2021 Texas energy crisis, deterministic models failed to account for RT price spikes exceeding \$9,000/MWh, resulting in catastrophic losses for under-hedged virtual bidders[^1][^11].

### Advantages of Probabilistic Scenario Analysis

Probabilistic forecasts enable robust optimization by:

- **Quantifying uncertainty**: A study of ISO-NE markets showed that integrating 500 price scenarios reduced revenue variance by 37% compared to deterministic strategies[^16].
- **Optimizing bid aggressiveness**: By correlating bid volumes with the probability of \$ \Delta P > 0 \$, traders achieve higher risk-adjusted returns. For example, Myst AI’s ML-driven strategy doubled Sharpe ratios by scaling bids inversely with forecasted volatility[^11].
- **Handling nonconvexities**: Markets with price caps or offer floors create discontinuous profit functions. Probabilistic models using mixed-integer stochastic programming resolve these nonconvexities, whereas deterministic methods often converge to locally optimal bids[^10][^17].

## Case Studies and Empirical Evidence

### ERCOT Market: Transformer-Based Probabilistic Forecasting

A 2023 study trained a Transformer model on ERCOT data, incorporating load forecasts, wind/solar generation, and temporal features[^1][^5]. The probabilistic model achieved a 62% accuracy in predicting positive DART spreads, compared to 48% for a deterministic LSTM baseline. Over a 12-month backtest, the probabilistic strategy yielded a cumulative profit of \$1.2M with a maximum drawdown of 9%, versus \$0.8M and 22% for deterministic[^1][^5].

### CAISO: Gaussian Process Regression for Extreme Events

Using GPR with contour sampling, researchers generated price scenarios emphasizing tail risks[^8]. A CVaR-optimized bidding strategy recovered 95.3% of perfect-information revenue, outperforming deterministic time-varying bid curves (94.9%) and self-scheduling (84.9%)[^8]. The probabilistic approach excelled during the August 2020 heatwave, where it captured 80% of the \$580/MWh price spike’s profit potential, while deterministic models missed 45% of the opportunity[^11].

### ISO-NE: Ensemble Forecasting for Risk-Averse Bidding

A 2021 MLP-LSTM hybrid model forecasted DART spreads with a root mean square error (RMSE) of \$214.98/MWh for top 1% volatility events[^16]. By optimizing bids using 10,000 Monte Carlo scenarios, the strategy achieved a 19% higher Sortino ratio than deterministic benchmarks, highlighting its superiority in downside risk mitigation[^16][^11].

## Strategic Implications for Market Participants

### Adaptive Bidding Curves

Probabilistic models enable dynamic bid curves that adjust to market regimes. For example:

- **High-volatility regimes**: Allocate 70–80% of bid volume to the 90th percentile of \$ \Delta P \$ scenarios to capture upside[^2][^11].
- **Low-volatility regimes**: Focus on high-frequency, low-volume bids around the median \$ \Delta P \$, reducing transaction costs[^4][^10].


### Market Impact and Equilibrium Considerations

Game-theoretic analyses reveal that widespread probabilistic bidding reduces arbitrage opportunities but improves market efficiency. As the number of virtual bidders increases, the Nash equilibrium converges to a state where \$ \mathbb{E}[\Delta P] \approx 0 \$, effectively eliminating predictable spreads[^17]. However, traders using advanced probabilistic models can still exploit transient inefficiencies 2–3x faster than deterministic counterparts[^17][^20].

## Conclusion

Probabilistic forecasting frameworks provide mathematically rigorous tools for optimizing virtual bid revenue in day-ahead markets. By explicitly modeling price spread distributions, these methods outperform deterministic approaches in risk-adjusted returns, tail risk management, and adaptive bidding. Empirical evidence from ERCOT, CAISO, and ISO-NE underscores the superiority of stochastic programming and ML-driven scenario analysis, particularly in high-renewable, high-volatility markets. Future research should explore real-time updating of probabilistic forecasts and decentralized learning algorithms to maintain competitive edges in increasingly efficient markets.
