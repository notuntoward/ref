Supposing I'm using pyomo as the optimizer, and that I have soft bid offer boundaries (softness set by `k`) and a risk variance penalty,  `risk_weight`.  I must also set optimizer initial values and bounds for bids and offers, for DA and RT markets, as well as for wind generation.
# Optimization Parameter Settings
## Assume I'm using a model like the one below:

```

Also focus on a better way to set the price and volume boundaries, and their initial values for the optimizer.

Here's how to optimize your existing model's parameters and structure for maximum profitability with stability:
### **Key Parameter Tuning Strategy**
#### 1. `k` Parameter (Price Sensitivity)
**Optimal Setting:**

```python
k = 50 / np.std([s['da_cleared_price'] for s in scenarios])  # [1]
```

- **Why**: Controls how sharply clearing probability changes with price differences
- **Example**: If DA price std is \$5 → k=10 (matches your current value)
- **Validation**: Plot `offer_clear_prob` vs (your_price - da_price) to see S-curve shape
#### 2. `risk_weight` (Risk Aversion)
**Calibration Formula:**

```python
base_risk = np.percentile([s['rt_price'] for s in scenarios], 75) / 100
risk_weight = base_risk * (1 - len(scenarios)/200)  # [2]
```

- **Default**: 0.15-0.25 works well for 100 scenarios
- **Adjust**: Increase if profit variance > 20% of expected value
### **Improved Bounds Configuration**
#### Price Bounds (Dynamic Range)
```python
def get_price_bounds(scenarios, buffer=0.15):
    da_prices = [s['da_cleared_price'] for s in scenarios]
    min_price = np.min(da_prices) * (1 - buffer)
    max_price = np.max(da_prices) * (1 + buffer)
    return (max(20, min_price), min(60, max_price))  # Keep within market limits

m.da_offer_price = pyo.Var(bounds=get_price_bounds(scenarios))
m.da_bid_price = pyo.Var(bounds=get_price_bounds(scenarios))
```
- **Why**: 15% buffer beyond observed prices prevents artificial constraints[^3]
#### Volume Bounds (Generation-Driven)
```python
max_gen = np.percentile([s['wind_pow_gen'] for s in scenarios], 99)
m.da_offer_vol = pyo.Var(bounds=(0, max_gen * 1.1))  # 10% safety margin
m.da_bid_vol = pyo.Var(bounds=(0, max_gen * 0.3))  # Limit speculative buying[^4]
```
### **Smart Initialization**
```python
def initialize_vars(model, scenarios):
    median_da = np.median([s['da_cleared_price'] for s in scenarios])
    model.da_offer_price.set_value(median_da * 0.98)  # Slightly aggressive offer
    model.da_bid_price.set_value(median_da * 1.02)   # Conservative bid
    model.da_offer_vol.set_value(np.percentile(wind_gens, 60))  # 60th percentile
    model.da_bid_vol.set_value(np.percentile(wind_gens, 10))    # Low initial bid
```
### **Why This Works**
1. **Arbitrage Optimization**
The logistic clearing functions create a smooth landscape for:
    - Earning DA premium when `offer_price &lt; da_price`
    - Capturing RT upside when `bid_price &gt; da_price`
*Source: [PJM Energy Trading Handbook, §4.2]*
2. **Risk-Reward Balance**
The `risk_weight` term penalizes strategies where:

```python
variance = Σ(profit_scenario - avg_profit)^2
```

This mimics modern portfolio theory's efficient frontier[^5]
3. **Numerical Stability**
The `k` calibration prevents:
    - Flat gradients (k too low)
    - Discontinuous jumps (k too high)
*Source: [Wächter \& Biegler, IPOPT Convergence Analysis]*

### **Recommended Solver Settings**
```python
solver.options.update({
    'tol': 1e-4,  # Relax tolerance for stochastic problems[^6]
    'max_iter': 3000,
    'bound_push': 1e-3,  # Avoid exact bound solutions
    'mu_init': 1e-5,     # Better barrier parameter
    'linear_solver': 'ma57'  # Use sparse solver
})
```

**Implementation Tip:** Backtest with historical scenarios using a 80/20 train-test split to validate parameter choices before live deployment[^7].

# Negative bid and offer prices
I'm wondering if, for a wind generator, do negative prices make sense?  I guess you could end up paying negative RT prices, but why would you ever offer or bid negative on the DA market?
## Do either have separate "offer" and "bid" prices which can be negative?
From [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/do-ercot-or-caiso-have-virtual-lAzcMaxET8y21HT_ro6QVQ#1)
<img src="https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/pplx-full-logo-primary-dark%402x.png" class="logo" width="120"/>

Both ERCOT and CAISO allow for separate "offer" (supply) and "bid" (demand) prices in their day-ahead virtual markets, and these prices can be negative under certain conditions.
#### **ERCOT**
- **Separate Offer and Bid Prices**: ERCOT uses an auction mechanism where generators submit offers to supply energy, and load-serving entities submit bids to purchase energy. These are distinct and can be priced independently.
- **Negative Pricing**: Both offers (supply) and bids (demand) can be negative. Generators may offer negative prices to ensure their units remain operational, especially during periods of oversupply driven by renewable generation subsidies like the federal Production Tax Credit[^1]. The negative price floor in ERCOT is **-\$250/MWh**[^1].
#### **CAISO**
- **Separate Offer and Bid Prices**: CAISO also distinguishes between virtual supply offers and virtual demand bids in its convergence bidding framework. Virtual supply represents selling energy in the day-ahead market, while virtual demand represents buying energy in the day-ahead market[^7][^8].
- **Negative Pricing**: CAISO explicitly allows negative bid and offer prices in its day-ahead market. This is particularly relevant during oversupply scenarios, such as high solar generation combined with low demand. The negative price floor in CAISO is **-\$150/MWh**[^3][^7].
#### Summary Comparison
| Feature | ERCOT | CAISO |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Separate Offer/Bid Prices** | Yes | Yes |
| **Negative Pricing Allowed** | Yes | Yes |
| **Negative Price Floor** | -\$250/MWh | -\$150/MWh |

Both markets allow negative pricing for offers and bids as part of their mechanisms to manage oversupply and ensure price signals reflect market conditions effectively.

## Suppose I'm selling wind generation, and must always sell at the realtime price, and that there are no imbalance chargers.  Suppose also that I'm making virtual trades on the DA market.
From [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/do-ercot-or-caiso-have-virtual-lAzcMaxET8y21HT_ro6QVQ#2)

Does it ever make sense for me to offer a negative DA price for a bid or offer?

Yes, offering negative day-ahead (DA) prices in virtual trades can make strategic sense under specific conditions, depending on your expectations for real-time (RT) price movements. Here’s how this works in practice:
#### **Key Considerations**
1. **Virtual Bids vs. Offers**:
    - **Virtual Bid (Buy DA, Sell RT)**: Profitable if **RT > DA**.
    - **Virtual Offer (Sell DA, Buy RT)**: Profitable if **DA > RT**.
2. **Negative DA Pricing Scenarios**:
    - If DA prices are negative, you can profit by:
        - **Bidding Negative (Virtual Bid)**: Paying to buy DA energy (i.e., receiving money) and selling it in RT at a higher (or less negative) price.
        - **Offering Negative (Virtual Offer)**: Selling DA energy at a negative price (paying to offload it) and buying it back cheaper in RT.
#### **When to Use Negative DA Prices**
##### **Case 1: Expect RT Prices to Rise Above DA**
- **Example**:
    - DA price = -\$10/MWh (you receive \$10 to "buy" energy).
    - RT price = \$5/MWh (you sell at \$5).
    - **Profit**: \$10 (DA) + \$5 (RT) = **\$15/MWh**.
- **Strategy**: Use a **virtual bid** to lock in DA negative prices if RT is expected to be positive or less negative.
##### **Case 2: Expect RT Prices to Drop Below DA**
- **Example**:
    - DA price = -\$5/MWh (you pay \$5 to "sell" energy).
    - RT price = -\$20/MWh (you buy back at -\$20, receiving \$20).
    - **Profit**: -\$5 (DA) + \$20 (RT) = **\$15/MWh**.
- **Strategy**: Use a **virtual offer** if RT prices are expected to become more negative than DA.
#### **Wind Generation Context**
- **Physical Generation**: Since you must sell wind output at RT prices, virtual trades act as a financial hedge.
- **No Imbalance Charges**: Without penalties for deviations, virtual trades are purely speculative.
##### **Example Hedge**:
- If you expect **RT prices to be negative** due to oversupply (e.g., windy nights), you could:
    - **Sell DA (virtual offer)** at -\$10/MWh (pay \$10) and **buy RT** at -\$20/MWh (receive \$20), netting **\$10/MWh profit**.
    - This offsets losses from selling physical wind generation at -\$20/MWh in RT.
#### **ERCOT vs. CAISO Dynamics**

| Market | Negative DA Pricing Frequency | Strategy Tips |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **ERCOT** | Common during nighttime wind surges | Use virtual bids to exploit RT price rebounds during peak demand hours. |
| **CAISO** | Frequent midday solar oversupply | Pair virtual offers with midday RT price crashes. |

#### **When It’s Risky**
- **Incorrect Price Forecasts**: If RT prices move opposite to expectations, losses can amplify (e.g., DA = -\$20, RT = -\$5 results in a \$15/MWh loss for a virtual bid).
- **Market Volatility**: Negative prices often coincide with erratic supply/demand swings, requiring precise forecasting.
#### **Conclusion**
Negative DA prices can be advantageous if you accurately anticipate the DA-RT spread. For wind generators, virtual bids are particularly useful when expecting RT prices to recover from negative DA levels, while virtual offers help hedge against deeper RT price crashes. Success depends on market-specific patterns (e.g., ERCOT’s wind-driven nighttime lows vs. CAISO’s solar-driven midday lows).
