# Definitions
## ERCOT
Use ERCOT definitions, although the description doesn't say so
- [Wind is considered a generator](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/in-ercot-explain-the-terms-bid-e26vrdh4ST2ejby9p5MzbA#1)
- Bid: 
	- price/quantity you'd pay to buy or sell energy
	- both DAM and RTM
- Offer: usually the price/quantity a generator is willing to supply energy or ancillary services
# The problem
- output: a single bid and offer price and quantity pair (PQ pair) for each hour
- should 
	- consider relationship between DA/RT price spreads across the day 
	- identify opportunities for arbitrage and risk management
