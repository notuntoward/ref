# Quick tutorials
## Filtering, edge detection, segmentation (tutorial)

From: [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/give-me-a-quick-tutorial-on-fi-Bl9XZUzdQ4.TmMGEsApSIQ)
Image processing techniques like filtering, edge detection, and segmentation are fundamental in computer vision and image analysis. Here's a quick tutorial on these essential concepts:

### Filtering

Filtering is a preprocessing step used to enhance or modify images. It involves applying mathematical operations to pixel values.

**Types of Filters:**
- Gaussian Blur: Reduces noise and smooths the image by applying a Gaussian function[1].
- Moving Average: Replaces each pixel with the average of its neighboring pixels[2].

### Edge Detection

Edge detection identifies boundaries of objects within images by detecting discontinuities in brightness[3].

**Common Edge Detection Techniques:**

- **Sobel Operator**
   - Uses <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">two 3x3 convolution</span> kernels to calculate gradients in <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">horizontal and vertical</span> directions[3].
     ![[Pasted image 20250116200345.webp|287]]
     
   - Gradient Magnitude: $$\sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}$$
   - Gradient Direction: $$\arctan(G_y/G_x)$$



- **Prewitt Operator**
   - Similar to Sobel, uses different kernels[4].
   - Horizontal kernel: $$\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
   - Vertical kernel: $$\begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
   - same Gx, Gy as Sobel

- **Canny Edge Detector**
   - Multi-stage algorithm for robust edge detection [1],[3].
   - Steps:
     a. Apply Gaussian blur: Smooth the image to reduce noise using a Gaussian filter.
     ![[__temp__Pasted image 20250116201142.webp|278]]
     b. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Compute intensity gradients</span>:  Compute the intensity gradients of the image using methods like Sobel or Prewitt.
     c. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Perform non-maximum suppression</span>: Thin out the edges by suppressing all gradients that are not local maxima.
     d. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Apply double thresholding</span>:  Identify strong and weak edges based on threshold values.
     e. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Track edges by hysteresis</span>: Finalize the edge detection by connecting weak edges to strong edges if they are part of the same edge segment.
### Segmentation

Segmentation partitions an image into multiple regions or objects, simplifying image representation for easier analysis [2], [3].

**Thresholding Segmentation:**
- Simple method based on pixel intensity values.
- Example: Set threshold at 100
  - Pixels > 100: Set to white (255)
  - Pixels ≤ 100: Set to black (0)

**Implementation Example (Python with OpenCV):**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Read image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Apply Gaussian blur
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), 0)

# Canny edge detection
edges = cv2.Canny(blurred, 50, 150)

# Simple thresholding segmentation
_, segmented = cv2.threshold(image, 100, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Display results
cv2.imshow('Original', image)
cv2.imshow('Edges', edges)
cv2.imshow('Segmented', segmented)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This tutorial provides a basic understanding of filtering, edge detection, and segmentation in image processing. These techniques form the foundation for more advanced computer vision tasks and are essential for various applications in image analysis and object recognition [1], [3], [5].
