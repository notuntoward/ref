# Prompt

Name the democratic countries where extreme right wing populists have been defeated in the last 5 years.  Explain what happened, what the causes were, and if any campaigns had an effect.  Demographic factors are also of interest.

Use empirical, academic sources, or studies from credible institutes like Pew or its international equivalents
# Response
In the past five years, several democratic countries have seen the defeat of extreme right-wing populist movements or leaders. Notable examples include Poland and Brazil. These cases highlight the interplay of political strategies, demographic shifts, and campaign dynamics in reversing the tide of right-wing populism.

## **Poland: The Defeat of Law and Justice Party (PiS) in 2023**

The right-wing populist Law and Justice Party (PiS) lost power in Poland's 2023 parliamentary elections after eight years of rule. Despite winning 35% of the vote, PiS lacked the parliamentary majority to form a government. A coalition of pro-democracy opposition parties, including Civic Coalition, Third Way, and The Left, pledged to govern instead. This marked a significant shift away from PiS's nationalist and authoritarian policies ==[1](https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/opinion/poland-has-shown-how-to-defeat-populism/)== ==[8](https://www.democratic-erosion.com/2023/12/03/recent-polish-elections-signal-a-shift-from-populism-potentially-across-europe-back-to-democracy/)== ==[10](https://www.populismstudies.org/eight-years-of-populist-rule-in-poland-comes-to-an-end/)==.

### **Key Factors**

1. **High Voter Turnout**: A record-breaking 74.4% voter turnout played a crucial role. Young voters were particularly mobilized, with their participation rising from 46% in 2019 to 69% in 2023 ==[8](https://www.democratic-erosion.com/2023/12/03/recent-polish-elections-signal-a-shift-from-populism-potentially-across-europe-back-to-democracy/)== ==[12](https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/warschau/21049.pdf)==.
2. **Demographic Shifts**: Women and urban voters were pivotal in opposing PiS's policies, including its restrictions on abortion rights and judicial independence ==[12](https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/warschau/21049.pdf)==.
3. **Opposition Unity**: Opposition parties formed a broad coalition to counter PiS's dominance, focusing on restoring democracy and improving EU relations ==[1](https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/opinion/poland-has-shown-how-to-defeat-populism/)== ==[10](https://www.populismstudies.org/eight-years-of-populist-rule-in-poland-comes-to-an-end/)==.
4. **Campaign Tactics**: PiS leveraged state media and resources for propaganda but faced backlash for its divisive rhetoric targeting minorities and opposition leaders ==[10](https://www.populismstudies.org/eight-years-of-populist-rule-in-poland-comes-to-an-end/)==.

### **Impact of Campaigns**

Grassroots mobilization by civil society groups and campaigns highlighting democratic erosion under PiS galvanized voters. Young women were particularly active in protests against restrictive abortion laws, which translated into electoral momentum for opposition parties ==[12](https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/warschau/21049.pdf)==.

## **Brazil: Bolsonaro's Defeat in 2022**

In Brazil's 2022 presidential election, leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva narrowly defeated far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro by less than 1% of the vote. Bolsonaro's presidency was marked by divisive rhetoric, anti-environmental policies, and a controversial handling of the COVID-19 pandemic ==[3](https://www.dw.com/en/just-how-far-right-was-brazils-bolsonaro/a-64249379)== ==[9](https://www.populismstudies.org/lula-is-back-third-time-lucky-or-will-his-return-lead-to-the-revival-of-bolsonaro/)== ==[11](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/a-review-of-right-wing-populism-in-latin-america-and-beyond/)==.

### **Key Factors**

1. **COVID-19 Mismanagement**: Bolsonaro's denialism during the pandemic alienated many voters as Brazil faced one of the world's highest death tolls ==[11](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/a-review-of-right-wing-populism-in-latin-america-and-beyond/)==.
2. **Economic Inequality**: Widespread dissatisfaction with economic inequality and Bolsonaro’s failure to address it eroded his support among lower-income voters ==[5](https://studenttheses.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item:3422257/view)== ==[11](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/a-review-of-right-wing-populism-in-latin-america-and-beyond/)==.
3. **Coalition Building**: Lula formed a "broad front" coalition that included former rivals to unite against Bolsonaro. This strategic alliance was instrumental in his victory ==[9](https://www.populismstudies.org/lula-is-back-third-time-lucky-or-will-his-return-lead-to-the-revival-of-bolsonaro/)==.
4. **Judicial Oversight**: Brazil's electoral courts took steps to curb misinformation during the campaign, though these efforts had mixed results ==[6](https://www.cigionline.org/articles/in-brazil-the-courts-efforts-to-curb-disinformation-had-unintended-consequences/)==.

### **Impact of Campaigns**

Lula's campaign emphasized social inclusion, environmental protection, and economic justice while leveraging his legacy as a former president who reduced poverty. His ability to appeal to diverse voter bases—despite Brazil's deep polarization—proved decisive ==[9](https://www.populismstudies.org/lula-is-back-third-time-lucky-or-will-his-return-lead-to-the-revival-of-bolsonaro/)== ==[11](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/a-review-of-right-wing-populism-in-latin-america-and-beyond/)==.

## **Common Themes Across Cases**

1. **Youth Mobilization**: In both Poland and Brazil, young voters played a critical role in challenging right-wing populism.
2. **Opposition Unity**: Broad coalitions among opposition parties were essential in overcoming entrenched populist regimes.
3. **Demographic Factors**: Urban voters, women, and younger demographics disproportionately opposed right-wing populists due to issues like social justice, climate change, and reproductive rights.
4. **Campaign Strategies**: Effective messaging that emphasized democratic values and social equity resonated with disillusioned voters.

These cases illustrate that while right-wing populism remains influential globally, it can be countered through strategic alliances, high voter engagement, and addressing key social issues that resonate with diverse demographics.
