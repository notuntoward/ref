## Conclusions
1. OTC is the right permit
2. In the OTC application, the list of devices should be a count, since fee is based on count
3. I need to call SCL to find out if line to pole can handle 200 A ^1e2101
	1. A: line is fine
	2. A: must change exterior box 100A fuse to 200A (mechanically possible?)
	3. A: Sam said he'd call it replacement-in-kind, but don't immediately upgrade interior box to 200A (call him to get tag reattached when done) 
4. Inspection request to inspection is at least 5 days. Current backlog is 4-5 days
   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">TODO:</mark> request inspection 5 days ahead of time
5. No problem getting an inspection between Dec 25th and Jan 1st, but ask for it a week ahead.
   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">TODO:</mark> ask for 2nd inspection > 1 week ahead
6. It's OK to request the inspection too early: they'll just do partial and you can schedule another one, although he didn't say if there was an additional fee.
7. It's OK to just ground the new receptacle above the bathroom mirror.  GFCI not required.
8. New wired smoke detectors are required
9. Wired smoke detectors must be on AFCI
10. I don't need to change kitchen GFCIs, but apparently must AFCI their circuit
11. No need to nail down Romex when using plastic boxes, as they have their own wire clamps.  <span style="color:#2354e7">I think this means its a good idea to just replace all boxes.</span>
12. I need to ground old metal exterior boxes.  But you can pigtail ground to a [green clip](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-14-12-AWG-Steel-Ground-Clips-Green-10-Pack-GOEC-CLIP/310741858) to the box ([how to install](https://youtu.be/JEFoEeTTg_4?t=91)), thus avoiding the need to to screw something into the box.  Alternatively, maybe I could instead buy [self-tapping (I think) green screws](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Southwire-10-32-Combination-Grounding-Screws-10-Pack-65176540/312660674).  <span style="color:#2354e7">Still, it may be simpler to just replace the box.</span>
    <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">TODO:</mark> check front and kitchen light boxes and decide what to do
13. External fixtures need a box, including lights
14. It's OK (and required) to seal the fixture to a mounting plate in the case of a light.
15. I don't need to change the patio GFCI box
16. New exterior GFCIs must be "in use," so I must buy a different exterior GFCI box than the one I've already bought.
    <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">TODO:</mark> buy new exterior box
17. What has to be exposed for inspection is up to the inspector.  Ask him.
    <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">TODO:</mark> be sure to ask for a "cover inspection" where ground wires have to be "made up" and exposed for inspection
    <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">TODO:</mark> after permit, ask inspector what has to be exposed.  See my options in my question.  Also, what to do about exterior things that are exposed to rain?
    <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Followup Q</mark>: get more details on cover inspection: grounds "made up?" Rain? 
18. Fished behind plaster doesn't have to be exposed for inspection
19. It's OK to just cover up romex running down cement walls.  Metallic cable not required.  <span style="color:#2354e7">Still, might be simpler to just do MC</span>
20. OK to rerun MC through cold air plenum
21. Old MC probably has to be replaced, if it's not grounded.
    <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">TODO:</mark> test old MC to see what's not grounded
22. Any "cable" (I think he means MC) on "new" panel must be GFCI
23. Could GFCI old ungrounded pushbutton switches by GFCIing their circuit.

## My list of Questions

### Wire to house and 200 A box
![[#^bc19ef]]
- [ ] Sub-panel instead of new box?  If wire is big enough, isn't limiting factor the 100A main breaker in the existing panel?
- [ ] Why 200 A: future heat pump (air, water), induction oven, EV
- [ ] Recommended homeowner wiring reference?  Quick Guide is just a copy of "added pages"
- [ ] Can inspection #1 inspect connection to 200A box, even if not hooked to line?
- [ ] Best place to put 200A box (in general, and when boxes are in parallel)

### My followup questions to [[#^e77e9d|Inside House Questions 12/14 response]]

Here's the [email of questions ](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/KtbxLzGDdKGbnsqsFZdxvxrlMLzgBpLrqV)I sent and got answers to:

#### Answers 12/14/23
My answers are in RED under your questions below.

Feel free to call me if you have any further questions.
Sincerely
David Rankin
Electrical Plan Review Manager

O: 206.684.8466 I [David.Rankin@seattle.gov](mailto:David.Rankin@seattle.gov)

1.   
    Does a metal-based light mounted above a bathroom mirror need to be GFCI'ed?  <span style="color:#ff0000">GFCI is required for receptacle outlets, however if the light over the mirror is metallic it is required to be grounded, however if no ground is available than because has a conductive housing, would have to be on GFCI.</span>
2. I have fairly new battery powered smoke and CO detectors. Do I need to replace them with permanently wired detectors?  <span style="color:#ff0000">The requirements for smoke detectors are covered in the IRC (International Residential Code) as modified by Seattle. </span> <span style="color:#ff0000">The code requires smoke detectors to be on 110 volt if you are required to obtain a permit for work being done in your home,</span>

> <span style="color:#ff0000">_[W] R314.2.2 Alterations, repairs and additions. Where alterations, repairs or additions requiring a permit occur, where one or more sleeping rooms are added or created in existing dwellings, or where an accessory dwelling unit is created within an existing dwelling unit, ((the individual)) eachdwelling unit shall be equipped with smoke alarms ((located)) as required for new dwellings. Exceptions: 1.Work involving the exterior surfaces of dwellings, such as the replacement of roofing or siding, the addition or replacement of windows or doors, or the addition of a porch or deck. 2.Installation, alteration or repairs of plumbing or mechanical systems._</span>


> <span style="color:#ff0000">_[W] R314.4 Interconnection. Where more than one smoke alarm is required to be installed within an individual dwelling unit in accordance with Section ((R314.3)) R314.2, the alarm devices shall be interconnected in such a manner that the actuation of one alarm will activate all of the alarms in the individual dwelling unit. Where an accessory dwelling unit is created within an existing dwelling unit all required smoke alarms, in the accessory dwelling unit and the primary dwelling unit, shall be interconnected in such a manner that the actuation of one alarm will activate all alarms in both the primary dwelling unit and the accessory dwelling unit. Physical interconnection of smoke alarms shall not be required where listed wireless alarms are installed and all alarms sound upon activation of one alarm. Exception: Smoke alarms and alarms installed to satisfy Section R314.4.1 shall not be required to be interconnected to existing smoke alarms where such existing smoke alarms are not interconnected or where such new smoke alarm or alarm is not capable of being interconnected to the existing smoke alarms. [W] R314.4.1 Heat detection interconnection. Heat detectors and heat alarms shall be connected to an alarm or a smoke alarm that is installed in the dwelling. Alarms and smoke alarms that are installed for this purpose shall be located in a hallway, room, or other location that will provide occupant notification. R314.5 Combination alarms. Combination smoke and carbon monoxide alarms shall be permitted to be used in lieu of smoke alarms._</span>


> <span style="color:#ff0000">_[W] R314.6 Power source. Smoke alarms, heat alarms, and heat detectors shall receive their primary power from the building wiring where such wiring is served from a commercial source and, where primary power is interrupted, shall receive power from a battery. Wiring shall be permanent and without a disconnecting switch other than those required for overcurrent protection. Exceptions: 1.Smoke alarms shall be permitted to be battery operated where installed in buildings without commercial power. 2.Smoke alarms installed in accordance with Section R314.2.2 shall be permitted to be battery powered._</span>
> 

3.  NEC 210.12 (A) says I don't need AFCI on a "fire alarm" circuit. Does that mean "smoke detector?"  <span style="color:#ff0000">AFCI is required for all outlets, be it a lighting outlet, receptacle outlet or smoke detector.  Outlet is defined as wherever energy is taken from the system.  A “fire alarm system” is typically similar to a commercial system, where there is a central fire alarm system cabinet with all the electronics, then fire alarm wiring to each smoke detector and another circuit to separate fire alarm horns or audible devices with strobes.  Residential smoke detectors are not fire alarm circuits.</span>

4. I'll be running cable behind old plaster to old work boxes: Is it still necessary to anchor the wire to a stud within 8” of the box?  There are exceptions in the code for fishing wire in walls or ceilings, not requiring it to be supported.  <span style="color:#ff0000">The 8” rule you quoted is regarding clamping romex to the box.  There is an exception in the code for single gang plastic boxes, clamps are not required if you nail within 8” of the box.  Old work boxes have clamps, thus nailing of the romex within 8” is not required.</span>

5. I'll need to rewire exterior lighting which is mounted on cedar shake walls

a. Do I need to replace the current ungrounded metal boxes behind the lights?  <span style="color:#ff0000">If there is a metal box behind a light, and it is metal, it has to be grounded with the new wiring.  You can use a green clip made for grounding the box or green hex grounding screw to bond the Equipment Grounding Conductor to the box and new device, light or receptacle.</span>

b. If so, is it OK to attach a board to the outside of the shakes, and then attach the new box to that board?  <span style="color:#ff0000">If there is no box, you can add a box to the outside and trim it to weatherproof or use a water proof box and mount a new light fixture to the box.</span>

c. Does this new box need a gland where the cable runs in to the box, or is it sufficient to seal lamp base to the mounting board with caulk or a gasket?  <span style="color:#ff0000">You need a box to mount a light fixture.  Read the installation instructions for the fixture, typically after mounting the fixture you have to seal the fixture mounting plate to make it water proof, and often, not seal the bottom of the mounting to allow a weep area to drain any moisture.</span>

6.  Are "while in use" outdoor receptacle covers required by code? I have one in a metal box that passed inspection about 15 years ago, but to use it, the cover needs to be flipped open.  <span style="color:#ff0000">Current code requires an In Use Cover, Extra Duty to be used for any outside outlets exposed to weather.  The outlet is required to be GFCI protected and the actual outlet is required to be Weather Resistant.</span>

a.  Do I need to replace this box?  <span style="color:#ff0000">If the box was installed under a permit complying with the codes at the time it was installed and passed inspection, you don’t have to replace the box, however it still has to be waterproof if exposed to weather.  After being rewired, an In Use cover would be required.</span>

b.  If I install a new box in a different location, does it have to be "while in use?  <span style="color:#ff0000">A new box would need to comply with all the current codes, thus an In Use cover etc.</span>

7.  My house has been partially rewired in Romex, and the job passed inspection about 15 years ago. I'd like to combining some of these Romex circuits into single breakers. I<span style="color:#ff0000">f when you combine the circuits you don’t exceed the capacity of the circuit, no issue.  Hard for me to answer this question because it is subjective.  The field inspector could answer the question.</span>

a. Is it allowable to do this by pigtailing inside the box, or does this need to be done in an external junction box?  <span style="color:#ff0000">If you mean Pig tailing inside the panel, yes you can in the panel.</span>

8. None of my current outlets are tamper resistant

a.  Do I need to replace all of them, or only the ones for which I'm upgrading from knob and tube to Romex?  <span style="color:#ff0000">The permit and inspection is for what you install, not what was existing.  If you don’t touch a receptacle, then nothing, any new receptacles has to comply with all the codes now, AFCI, GFCI and Tamper Resistant all where are required by the code.  If you remove an old receptacle and want to replace it, the new has to comply with what is required for that location, again AFCI, GFCI and TR.  In section 406 is an exception to allow a 2 prong receptacle to be replaced with a 2 prong outlet however.
</span>
9. The kitchen and garage were rewired to code about 15 years ago, and I don't plan to change any circuits there. Do I need to update this e.g. Is it necessary to bring their receptacles up to code too?  <span style="color:#ff0000">Again, only the work you are doing is what has to comply with the current code.</span>

a. For example, do I need to replace the GFCI's with tamper-resistant GFCI's?  <span style="color:#ff0000">If you do not intend to replace the receptacles then nothing changes.</span>

b. Do the kitchen circuits need AFCI?, except ones excluded by NEC, for example the fridge outlet?  <span style="color:#ff0000">210.12 identifies the kitchen as a location that requires AFCI thus all the outlets in the kitchen are required to be protected by AFCI.</span>

10. What has to be exposed for inspection?  <span style="color:#ff0000">We have a cover inspection where all the ground wires have to be made up and allow the inspector to see the made up ground wires.</span>

a. Switches & outlets connected but hanging out of boxes?  <span style="color:#ff0000">Talk to the inspector once you obtain your electrical permit and ask what they will want to see.</span>

b. How can I show new Romex trunks inside walls? <span style="color:#ff0000">I don’t understand the question.</span>

c.  How can I show cable attachment to 2x4?  <span style="color:#ff0000">You are allowed to fish in cable when rewiring.</span>

d.  What has to be open for inspections of exterior lighting and receptacles? I'm concerned about the possibility of rain.  <span style="color:#ff0000">Romex per section 334 is only allowed in a dry location, thus if you have exterior wiring protect the romex.  Speak with your inspector.</span>

f.  I'm planning to do partial inspections, where for the first inspection, circuits may not be connected to the main box, and on the next, the would be plastered over as well as connected.

i. Is that an acceptable plan?  <span style="color:#ff0000">Request a cover inspection and go over what you want to do  when you get your permit.  The field inspector will let you know what they expect.</span>

11. In an unfinished basement, I have some uncovered Romex running down a cement wall to wall-mounted fixtures.

a. Is it acceptable to cover this wire with wiremol or a wooden box? <span style="color:#ff0000">Yes or provide a raceway for physical protection for the romex.</span>

b. Or does it all need to be replaced with metalic cable?<span style="color:#ff0000"> No</span>

12. In that basement, a cold air return plenum is built sheet metalling over the gap between adjacent ceiling joists. Currently a metal cable runs through this plenum, entering and exiting it through holes drilled in the joints.

a. Is this still to code? An exception to NEC to 300.22 seems to say that it is, but could you confirm? <span style="color:#ff0000">Yes, you are allowed to run perpendicular through a return penum.</span>

b. Am I allowed to replace the metal cable and run it through the same holes through the plenum?  <span style="color:#ff0000">Yes</span>

13. I believe I'll have to replace all the metal cable in the basement, as it's original, from 1945

a. Is that correct?  <span style="color:#ff0000">You are not required to replace if the original installation was per code and inspected, however is there a ground wire (Equipment Grounding Conductor) in the cable?  Ether way, the cable with a new panel would require being on GFCI.</span>

14. I have many older push button switches that I like the look of, but which aren't grounded.

a. Would they be compliant if I reinstalled them in plastic boxes, and made sure to pigtail grounds together when the Romex goes to the next switch? <span style="color:#ff0000">Most likely, speak with the field inspector.  New switches are to be grounded and have green ground screws to bond them to the EGC.  There are exceptions for existing switches in Section 404.  Switches have to be grounded however GFCI is one exception, thus if the circuit is on a GFCI they do not have to be grounded.  Also there is a comment about this if there are no grounding surfaces within 8’ vertically and 5’ horizontally.</span>

## Wiring Permit

### Wiring Permit Answers
[Email from David Rankin, Seattle.gov](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/QgrcJHrtsHhCNvJQTGHZvmzsSbknKXSMFjV)

From: <ElectricalPlanReview@seattle.gov>

Electrical Plan Review Manager
[Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections](http://www.seattle.gov/sdci)
O: 206.684.8466 I [David.Rankin@seattle.gov](mailto:David.Rankin@seattle.gov)
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/seattlesdci) I [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seattlesdci) I [Blog](http://buildingconnections.seattle.gov/)

1.      Since I own the house, I understand from [here](https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=31323334-50bba2bf-31321b84-4544474f5631-2e5042aae5bb000c&q=1&e=68b75c8d-ba0a-4eee-90fa-375651cb8e40&u=https%3A%2F%2Fseattlegov.zendesk.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F115004979048-Which-Electrical-Permit-Should-I-Choose-) that I should apply for an OTC permit.  Is that correct?  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">YES</mark>

2.      Is it then also correct that all I need to include in my permit application are the following:

1.      Work site address  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">YES</mark>

2.      Applicant information <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">YES</mark>

3.      Installer information <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">YES</mark>

4.      Brief job description <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">YES</mark>

5.      Itemized list of what is to be installed, for example, number of connections: receptacles, lights, switches, bath fans, washers, dryers, ranges and services <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Yes you need to count up the number of devices you are installing.  The permit for the work and fee for the permit is based on what you are installing, thus the selections you make while creating your permit.</mark>

3.       Can the wire from my house to the distribution line handle a new 200A box?  The current box is 100A, but the line to the pole was replaced around 5 years ago.   I have no records of the work, but there should be a permit on file for it.  Would the permit answer this question, and if so, where can I get it? <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Seattle City Light owns the line from the pole to your house.  Typically they have two sizes and for a single family residence, 200 amp service, they use the smaller.  I cant say your load will not impact the line, but Seattle City Light has it down to what is needed.</mark>

4.      How long will the OTC approval take?  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If you intend to do the work, you take out the permit.  If you are having an electrical contractor do the work, they take out the permit.  If you take out the permit, as soon as you fill out the forms and pay the fee, the Over the Counter permit is issued as soon as you punch the last button.  You can go into the record and print out a permit face.</mark>

5.      How much delay should I expect between approval and inspection?  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">When you install electrical, you call in or go on line and call for an inspection.  Currently we are about 4 to 5 days backlogged, thus looking ahead, you could obtain an inspection after you complete a section as much work as you wish to have inspected.</mark>

6.       Is it possible to schedule an inspection on a specific date? <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">You may request an inspection for any date, subject to the availability of inspection openings.  If the day is full, you will not be able to schedule an inspection and will have to go to the next available date.</mark>

Thanks,

7. Is in inspection possible between Dec 25 and Jan 1? (from [my followup email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/QgrcJHrtsHhCNvJQTGHZvmzsSbknKXSMFjV))   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">... plan ahead at least a week for an inspection.  No problem getting an inspection between Dec 25th and Jan 1st, during work day schedule.  No problem getting an inspection between Dec 25th and Jan 1st, during work day schedule.</mark>
### How I got there
Tried to call the [Applicant Services Center](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/about-us/who-we-are/applicant-services-center) at: (206) 684-8850 but message said the won't accept calls, must email otcpermit@seattle.gov (but that email is broken, along with a supposed chat interface)

In the end, I submitted a question using this [web form](https://sdci.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests), but that didn't work either, but [they gave me yet another](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGtxdQDCRrDgJHFxGRzrlTKCQKq) email address, where I sent [this email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/QgrcJHrtsHhCNvJQTGHZvmzsSbknKXSMFjV).

### My Questions
1. Verify that I'm correct:

2. Can my wire to the power pole handle a 200 A box?  Is there a permit on file for this?
3. How long will permit approval take?
4. Is it possible to schedule final inspection on a fixed date?
