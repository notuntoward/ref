## Introduction: Workshop Lighting Tutorial

![[abcfff2d67e71f12108ed6aefcc79505_MD5.png|House Rewire/attachments/abcfff2d67e71f12108ed6aefcc79505_MD5.png]]

I found myself tired of the shadows and dimly-lit spaces around my shop, so I decided to upgrade my workshop lighting.

This process could have been as easy as a trip to the big box store to grab the cheapest shop lights available, but _that's just not me_. Since this is an investment and I'm going to spend the time installing it and then have to live with it, I decided I wanted to _do it right_. This meant learning everything there is to know about shop lights. And boy is there are a lot to know! Not to worry, I've broken it down and simplified it for you.

## Step 1: Overview

There are 5 main factors to consider when deciding which light fixtures to choose for your workshop.

1.  **Bulb type**
2.  **Color temperature**
3.  **Color rendering index**
4.  **Installation type (wiring)**
5.  **Lumens**

Then there's **how many light fixtures** you'll need, and how to figure out the **optimal layout**. I'll go through each of these, step by step below, and then let you know what I decided to go with in the end.

## Step 2: Bulb Type

![[2dc3c8815e523322475d748399fc1267_MD5.png|House Rewire/attachments/2dc3c8815e523322475d748399fc1267_MD5.png]]

The first decision you'll need to make is between **fluorescent vs. LED** lights which are the most common types of shop lights and come in 4 or 8 foot tube fixtures.

LEDs are becoming more and more affordable and have many advantages over fluorescent lights, like no flickering, lower energy consumption (cost savings), and they’ll turn on even if it’s really cold in your work space. Not to mention they’re instantly bright, not like fluorescents that get progressively brighter.

## Step 3: Color Temperature

![[ac22661caa3b030064b5c2eee1c29737_MD5.jpg|House Rewire/attachments/ac22661caa3b030064b5c2eee1c29737_MD5.jpg]]

The first decision you'll want to make is color temperature. This is how **cool or warm** the light will appear and it’s measured in **Kelvin**. An <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">incandescent</mark> light is very cozy, also called a warm light, at around <span style="color:#00b050">2,700K</span>, while lighting you’ll typically find in an office or garage is on the cooler side, also called <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">daylight</mark> bulbs, usually around <span style="color:#00b050">5,000K and sometimes up to 6,500K</span> - which most people say is almost blue and makes for a very <span style="color:#ff0000">sterile</span> environment.

The general consensus I found for woodworking and garage <span style="color:#ffc000">workshop</span> settings seems to be at <span style="color:#00b050">5,000K</span>, while some prefer a tad warmer, around <span style="color:#00b050">4,000K</span>. (NOTE: [Nate has 4000K on his bench, would have liked 3800 K]([If it is a work space, I would go with](onenote:https://d.docs.live.net/4bbd96b3698748f8/Documents/OneNote%20Notebooks/Scott's%20Notebook/House.one#Basement%20Wiring&section-id={6F22C67C-5080-4F4C-B55A-DD060731E1AA}&page-id={5D945FBE-5BF8-4A33-AB97-46F3C2F82FAF}&object-id={23C19C5A-BC18-0391-05B3-12827D6685AC}&BE)  ([Web view](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=4BBD96B3698748F8%21214&id=documents&wd=target%28House.one%7C6F22C67C-5080-4F4C-B55A-DD060731E1AA%2FBasement%20Wiring%7C5D945FBE-5BF8-4A33-AB97-46F3C2F82FAF%2F%29))))

## Step 4: CRI

![[c52283a1e17b27e86c644921f080aee4_MD5.jpg|House Rewire/attachments/c52283a1e17b27e86c644921f080aee4_MD5.jpg]]

Next you want to look at the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">CRI</mark> which is the **color rendering index**, and this is _how accurately the lighting will allow you to see colors_.

When you’re working with finishes and stains, you want to be able to see the colors as accurately as possible. _The higher the CRI the better_ (scale 0-100). Ideally you'll want to hit the <span style="color:#00b050">92-95 range</span>, (Note: [Nate says 95](onenote:https://d.docs.live.net/4bbd96b3698748f8/Documents/OneNote%20Notebooks/Scott's%20Notebook/House.one#Basement%20Wiring&section-id={6F22C67C-5080-4F4C-B55A-DD060731E1AA}&page-id={5D945FBE-5BF8-4A33-AB97-46F3C2F82FAF}&object-id={23C19C5A-BC18-0391-05B3-12827D6685AC}&BE)) which seems to be the highest CRI you can get for LED tube lights.

## Step 5: Installation Type (wiring)

![[40545877574f8af9f39d00cd0c97f45f_MD5.jpg|House Rewire/attachments/40545877574f8af9f39d00cd0c97f45f_MD5.jpg]]

Some lights need to be hardwired individually, others are plug-in. For fixtures requiring hard wiring, you may need to hire a licensed electrician, or fish wires through your ceiling.

If you opt for plug-in type fixtures and you plan to install more than one, you'll also want to make sure you're the fixtures are **linkable**, which means they can also be **daisy chained**. Daisy chaining means that the lights can be linked together with power cords, that way you only need to plug the first one into an outlet and the others simply get connected together.

## Step 6: Lumen Output

![[020acd92e58dbab7ed8046907648ab8f_MD5.jpg|House Rewire/attachments/020acd92e58dbab7ed8046907648ab8f_MD5.jpg]]

_How many light fixtures do I need for my space?_

In order to figure this out, you'll need to know how many **lumens** your light fixture has.

The lumen output is almost like the **intensity** of the light. _The more the lumens, the brighter the room will seem_. Once you know how many lumens your fixture has, you can calculate the number of fixtures you’ll need for your space.

The recommendations I found start at <span style="color:#ffc000">70 LM per square foot</span> for a mechanic’s or woodshop and range anywhere u<span style="color:#ffc000">p to 100 LM per square foot</span> (<span style="color:#ff0000">assuming an 8 foot ceiling or fixture height</span>).

Start by measuring your space and multiply the length by the width to get your square footage. Then multiply your square footage by 70 to get the minimum lumen requirement for your workshop.

_For example, my shop is 12' x 16' = 192 square feet. I would require a minimum of 192 x 70 = 13,440 lumens. If I went with light fixtures each having 3,500 lumens, I would need at least 4 (13,440/3,500=3.84)._

## Step 7: Layout

![[2473a90f292beda88dbcd24a36fe2202_MD5.png|House Rewire/attachments/2473a90f292beda88dbcd24a36fe2202_MD5.png]]

I came across this article from [Wood magazine](https://www.woodmagazine.com/woodworking-tips/techniques/outfitting-woodworking-shop/easy-light-fixture-positioning) that explains how to figure out the best layout for your lighting and avoid any dark spots.

-   A - The distance from your main work surfaces to the ceiling (or to the desired height of suspended fixtures).  
    _Ex: my table saw and workbench are at 34" off the ground, my ceiling is at 99" and I will flush mount my fixtures. Therefore A = 99"-34"=65" or A=5'5"._
-   B - The distance between fixtures, should be equal to or no more than 1.5 times (A).  
    _Ex: B=5'5"-8'_
-   C - The distance between a fixture and the wall (C) should be no more than one third to one half (B).  
    _Ex: If I go with B=6', C=2'-3'._

_The above assume the use of continuous rows of two-lamp fixtures._

## Step 8: Bringing It All Together

![[ba6d511437fbcba4fcb7a6f871a94d53_MD5.jpg|House Rewire/attachments/ba6d511437fbcba4fcb7a6f871a94d53_MD5.jpg]]

In the end, it boils down to personal preference for the color temperature, your budget and product availability.

After researching and analyzing all the specs, I decided to go with these [Hyperikon 4,000K 4-ft LED linkable shop lights](https://amzn.to/2IMTtqR). They have 4,000 lumens per fixture and a CRI of 84. I would have liked to get a higher CRI, but given my budget and what was available to me in Canada, this was the best I could find at this price point.

As I try to adjust to the 4,000K, I question whether I should have gone with the 5,000K after all. The shop seems nice and warm, the light output is good, but the lighting is a bit on the yellow side. Nevertheless, it's bright, well-lit and I can now actually see what I'm doing!
