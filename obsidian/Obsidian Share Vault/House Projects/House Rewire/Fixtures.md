# Boxes

- [ ] What is the best way to put them in when I've already got a box for an existing switch or receptacle?  These are probably nailed to studs, so getting them outta there will make a big hole.  But can I do anything else?
- [ ] can I reuse the old boxes?
- [ ] can I leave the wires loose in the walls, instead of nailing them down
- [ ] when I run them through studs, do I need to put in those metal nail guards?
## Studless remodeling boxes
Anyway... assuming I'll be putting in some new holes, these seem easier (Nate said he did this, electrician in videos below said he prefers to nail them in, but he clear does remodel boxes too)

# Bathroom Fan

### Size needed

-
- Sizing calculation: I need at least 50 cfm
	- bathroom size: 7' x 5' = 35 ft^2
	- From table below, I need at least 50 cfm (formula for a bathroom > 50 ft^2 would say 35 ft^2

From: [Is Your Bathroom Exhaust Fan Powerful Enough? Haas and Sons Electric](https://haasandsons.com/is-your-bathroom-exhaust-fan-powerful-enough/#:~:text=We%20recommend%20at%20least%20an,reduce%20the%20risk%20of%20mold.)

| **Bathroom Size** | **Minimum Ventilation (CFM) Required*** |
| ---- | ---- |
| Less than 50 sq. feet | 50 CFM |
| 50-100 sq. feet | 1 CFM per sqare foot of floor space |
# Model Selection

-  [Broan-NuTone AE110 110 CFM 1.0 Sones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016UQ2YN8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) 
	- What I bought first
	- It's  more than 2X bigger than the minimum
	- It did a good job of clearing the steam.  I could even feel the breeze
	- But it was loud, and I didn't love the noise
- [Broan Flex Series 80 CFM 0.8 Sones](https://www.amazon.com/Broan-Ceiling-Mounted-Certified-CleanCoverTM/dp/B00NHJHQVC)
	- looks prettier
	- This is a newer model than the 80 CFM model linked to on the AMZ page where I bought the AE110
	- said to be quieter: 0.8 Sones vs. 1.0 Sones
	- still plenty big: 80/50 = **1.6X oversized**
	- Comparing parts lists, it seems like it would fit in the already box I've already installed for the AE110
		- [AE80K](https://shop.broan-nutone.com/parts/AE80K)
		- AE110
			- has two models: [Product Iterations](https://shop.broan-nutone.com/iterations/AE110)
				- shroud part numbers
					- [AE110-A](https://shop.broan-nutone.com/parts/AE110-A): *different part #* for shroud
					- [AE110-B](https://shop.broan-nutone.com/parts/AE110-B): *same part #* for shroud as for AE89K
				- but shrouds look the same
				- and other part #'s seem the same
		- So: **the AE80K almost certainly fits in the AE110 shroud**
### Installation
- [how to uninstall]() the Broan-Nutone 110 CFM fan bought
	- unscrewes side wing brackets, where the cover-holding springs go
	- put a big screwdriver behind the wings, wedged between the plastic parts and the metal housing, and gradually pry it out, alternating side-to-side, pulling it down by the fan hub as it goes.
