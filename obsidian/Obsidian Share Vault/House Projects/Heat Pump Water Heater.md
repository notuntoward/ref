### CO2 Impact
From [Rewire Projects $/CO2]([Rewire projects: $/CO2](onenote:https://d.docs.live.net/4bbd96b3698748f8/Documents/OneNote%20Notebooks/Scott's%20Notebook/House.one#Rewire%20projects%20$/CO2&section-id={6F22C67C-5080-4F4C-B55A-DD060731E1AA}&page-id={29CAAA00-2A29-48FC-9256-296E9269FFB8}&end)  ([Web view](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=4BBD96B3698748F8%21214&id=documents&wd=target%28House.one%7C6F22C67C-5080-4F4C-B55A-DD060731E1AA%2FRewire%20projects%3A%20%24%5C%2FCO2%7C29CAAA00-2A29-48FC-9256-296E9269FFB8%2F%29)))
- 620 kg CO2/year
- I think it was the (distant) 3rd best project CO2/$
### Heat Pump Models
- Rheem 50 Gal. Platinum: [$1700](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Rheem-Performance-Platinum-50-Gal-10-Year-Hybrid-High-Efficiency-Tank-Electric-Heat-Pump-Water-Heater-XE50T10H45U0/312742081)
### Cost

If I can get the incentives...

- Payback time (optimistic): **11 years**
	- $1700/$158 = 10.8 years
- Install cost (optimistic): $2200 - $500 = **$1700**
	- purchase and install: **$2200**
		- $1700 + $500 install = $2200
		- *Assuming* I can make it fit in the **100A breaker box**
	- incentives: **$500** ($1160 if I could have gotten the federal credit)
		- coupon: $500
		- federal: 0.3*$2200 = $660 
			- I don't think I qualify
			- I *think* the rule is that you must make < 150% of regional median
- Energy Savings (optimistic): **$158/yr**
	- Home Depot [says](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Rheem-Performance-Platinum-50-Gal-10-Year-Hybrid-High-Efficiency-Tank-Electric-Heat-Pump-Water-Heater-XE50T10H45U0/312742081) "Hybrid electric heat pump saves up to $315 in annual energy costs"
	- [I use about half the energy of homes the size of mine](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGwJccLgmShXGtSRtBSRDSlcxGX). 
	- Also, the Home Depot number is probably average sized homes.  My house is 1130 ft^2; the [US average is 2,185](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/mortgages/articles/how-big-is-your-home-here-is-the-average-home-size-by-state/).
	- Still, just cut it in half: $315/2 = $158
