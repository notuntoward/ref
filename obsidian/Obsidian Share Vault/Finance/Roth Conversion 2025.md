I thought I might reduce taxes with an early Roth conversion. If I get a job very soon, a conversion probably won't work, but I should still add my standard $8k yearly limit to my Roth.  If it takes me very long to get a job, I should do both.
# Why do an early Roth conversion?

You pay taxes on whenever you withdraw money from a 401K, either cashing it out, or converting it to a Roth.  Money (always deposited post-tax) grows within a Roth, so you don't pay for taxes when you withdraw it.  So it's like a 401K, I think, except that you pay taxes at different times, and at <u>different tax brackets</u>, depending upon the Roth withdrawal year income.

If your current tax bracket is lower than your expected retirement tax bracket, then it may make sense to do an early Roth conversion:
- **benefit**: you pay your 401k taxes in a lower bracket
- **potential cost**: depends (at least) on how you pay your 401k withdrawal taxes
	- if you pay by withdrawing 401k investments, then you don't continue earning on those investments, and this could bump up your tax bracket
	- if you pay with cash outside of the 401k, then it can't bump up your withdrawal-year tax bracket, but you won't earn (taxable) interest and/or dividends on it either.

##### Likely Retirement Money Needs and Taxable Income
In retirement, how much money would I need to withdraw from my 401k?
- I've estimated somewhere that I'd need about $70k/year expenses
- My 70 year old soc. sec benefits are $3155/mo = $37860/yr
	- So, I'd withdraw $70k - $37860 = $32400/yr
- SocSec is taxable income so doesn't matter: **retirement income $70k/yr** (22% tax bracket)
##### 2025 Tax Bracket Scenarios
###### Tax bracket if I get a job soon
I'm unemployed for at least half of 2025 (as of June 2025, and it's not looking good).  Optimistically, I could earn half of my last year's pay which, with a $20k bonus, would have been $200k.  

Let's say, for 2025:
- earned income: $80k
- unemployment benefits: $20k
- *Optimistic 2025 taxable income*: **$100k/yr**

This means I'd have filled the 22% tax bracket, which ends at at $100k.  This is higher than my retirement tax bracket. So **a Roth conversion doesn't make sense.**

###### Tax Bracket If I don't get a job in 2025

If I don't get a job, my tax bracket will be determined by my unemployment benefits

- *No job 2025 taxable income*: **$20k/yr**

This means I'd be in the 12% tax bracket and could stay in it with a total taxable income up to $47.15k.

It would make sense to convert $47.15k - $20k = **$27.1k**

##### Conclusion

**No matter what, I can put $8k of cash** (I have a lot) into a Roth. 

*If I get a job soon*, a Roth conversion wouldn't make sense, but **putting in $8k** into a Roth would still make sense, since I could withdraw it at age 59.5, and interest in there would accrue tax free.

*If I don't get a job at all*, then I could **convert $27.15k** and **add the extra $8k**
