# Combining 401Ks into Josh Tadke's Fund

## Funds to combine
- Alight
	- Siemens
	- kinda bad performance, maybe 12% over 2024
		- Fidelity Vaisala, Putnam was 25% or something.  Not sure about Fidelity GE
- Principle
	- CPR's old fund
	- they keep trying to get me out of it
	- Last year's return was 7.56 % (but I had those risk-averse funds)
	- will lose $3-4k since not totally vested when quit
- RCSR (was Rocky Mountain)
	- Hanwha's old fund
	- Return over 2024 was roughly zero???
		- won't print total return over 2024, says it's "unavailable"
	- Just to simplify
