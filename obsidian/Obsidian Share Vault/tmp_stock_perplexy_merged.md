Two notable defeats of right-wing populist governments have occurred in recent years:

## Poland
A broad coalition led by Donald Tusk defeated the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) in late 2023 ==[6](https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/right-wing-populists-would-win-poland-today)== [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]]. The victory came after PiS had held power for nearly a decade and had quadrupled their vote share between 2001-2019 ==[8](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/06/populists-in-europe-especially-those-on-the-right-have-increased-their-vote-shares-in-recent-elections/)==. The defeat was achieved through:

**Coalition Building**
- Three opposition parties formed a broad coalition of diverse political actors [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]]
- The unified opposition strategy proved effective against the incumbent PiS

## Finland
The Finns Party suffered a significant electoral defeat in the 2024 European Parliament elections:
- Dropped to sixth place nationally
- Lost 6.2% of their previous vote share [Herkman24LfinnPopulistLoss➔Z8X4PF32](zotero://select/library/items/Z8X4PF32)

## Attempted but Failed Defeats

**Spain**
Despite losing over 600,000 votes in the most recent general election, the far-right maintains influence due to high political polarization [Euronews24spainVoxRightEU➔UX6ZXAXR](zotero://select/library/items/UX6ZXAXR) ==[14](https://whogoverns.eu/in-polarised-spain-populists-win-even-when-they-lose-the-elections/)==. The country remains in a paradoxical situation where populist forces retain significant influence even after electoral defeats ==[14](https://whogoverns.eu/in-polarised-spain-populists-win-even-when-they-lose-the-elections/)==.

It's worth noting that the trend in most of Europe has been moving in the opposite direction, with right-wing populist parties gaining strength in countries like Italy (Brothers of Italy), Sweden (Sweden Democrats), and Hungary (Fidesz) ==[8](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/06/populists-in-europe-especially-those-on-the-right-have-increased-their-vote-shares-in-recent-elections/)==. Recent research indicates that 2024 may see one of the most significant challenges to liberal democracy since the end of the Cold War ==[9](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/12/26/right-wing-populism-are-set-to-sweep-the-west-in-2024/)==.

Several right-wing populist parties in democratic countries have experienced setbacks in recent years. Here's a look at some specific instances:

*   **Poland**: In Poland, the right-wing populist Law and Justice Party (PiS) lost its ruling position after a resounding victory of the Donald Tusk-led coalition in elections a year prior ==[6](https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/right-wing-populists-would-win-poland-today)== [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]]. The Law and Justice Party (PiS) had significantly increased its vote share between 2001 and 2019 ==[8](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/06/populists-in-europe-especially-those-on-the-right-have-increased-their-vote-shares-in-recent-elections/)==.

*   **Finland:** The Finns Party, a populist radical-right party, had a disappointing result in the 2024 European Parliament elections, losing 6.2% of their votes [Herkman24LfinnPopulistLoss➔Z8X4PF32](zotero://select/library/items/Z8X4PF32).

It's worth noting that despite some losses, right-wing populist parties have also seen successes in recent years ==[8](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/06/populists-in-europe-especially-those-on-the-right-have-increased-their-vote-shares-in-recent-elections/)==. For example, nine far-right parties have formed a new bloc called Identity and Democracy (ID) in the European Parliament ==[1](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36130006)==. Recent elections in Italy and Sweden have been successes for right-wing populist parties ==[8](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/06/populists-in-europe-especially-those-on-the-right-have-increased-their-vote-shares-in-recent-elections/)==. In Italy, Giorgia Meloni, a far-right leader, claimed victory in the election and is on track to become the country's first female prime minister ==[5](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63029909)==.

In the past five years, several democratic countries have seen the defeat of extreme right-wing populist parties due to various political, social, and demographic factors. Below are key examples and analyses:

## Poland
- **What Happened:** In 2023, Poland's ruling right-wing populist party, Law and Justice (PiS), lost power to a coalition led by Donald Tusk. This marked the end of nearly eight years of PiS dominance ==[6](https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/right-wing-populists-would-win-poland-today)== [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]].
- **Causes:** The defeat was attributed to growing dissatisfaction with PiS's authoritarian tendencies, corruption scandals, and controversial judicial reforms that alienated moderate voters. The opposition's ability to unite diverse political factions into a broad coalition was also critical [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]].
- **Campaign Effects:** The opposition focused on restoring democratic norms and improving relations with the European Union. High voter turnout, especially among urban and younger demographics, played a significant role [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]].
- **Demographics:** Urban voters, women, and younger generations were pivotal in rejecting PiS's socially conservative policies ==[6](https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/right-wing-populists-would-win-poland-today)== [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]].

## Finland
- **What Happened:** In the 2024 European Parliament elections, Finland's radical-right Finns Party suffered significant losses, dropping 6.2% in vote share and finishing sixth nationally [Herkman24LfinnPopulistLoss➔Z8X4PF32](zotero://select/library/items/Z8X4PF32).
- **Causes:** The decline was linked to internal divisions within the party and its inability to expand its voter base beyond its core supporters. Additionally, economic issues overshadowed identity politics during the campaign [Herkman24LfinnPopulistLoss➔Z8X4PF32](zotero://select/library/items/Z8X4PF32).
- **Campaign Effects:** Mainstream parties emphasized economic stability and climate policies, which resonated more with voters than the Finns Party's anti-immigration rhetoric [Herkman24LfinnPopulistLoss➔Z8X4PF32](zotero://select/library/items/Z8X4PF32).
- **Demographics:** Younger voters and urban areas leaned heavily toward progressive parties focused on climate change and equality [Herkman24LfinnPopulistLoss➔Z8X4PF32](zotero://select/library/items/Z8X4PF32).

## Spain
- **What Happened:** In Spain's 2023 general elections, the far-right Vox party lost over 600,000 votes compared to previous elections. It failed to expand its influence despite political polarization [Euronews24spainVoxRightEU➔UX6ZXAXR](zotero://select/library/items/UX6ZXAXR) ==[14](https://whogoverns.eu/in-polarised-spain-populists-win-even-when-they-lose-the-elections/)==.
- **Causes:** Vox's aggressive rhetoric alienated centrist voters while its association with controversial alliances weakened its appeal. The Socialist Party (PSOE) effectively mobilized progressive coalitions to counteract Vox's rise [Euronews24spainVoxRightEU➔UX6ZXAXR](zotero://select/library/items/UX6ZXAXR) ==[14](https://whogoverns.eu/in-polarised-spain-populists-win-even-when-they-lose-the-elections/)==.
- **Campaign Effects:** Campaigns highlighting economic recovery post-COVID-19 and social progress were more effective than Vox's focus on cultural issues [Euronews24spainVoxRightEU➔UX6ZXAXR](zotero://select/library/items/UX6ZXAXR).
- **Demographics:** Women and younger voters overwhelmingly rejected Vox's socially conservative platform, favoring progressive policies instead ==[14](https://whogoverns.eu/in-polarised-spain-populists-win-even-when-they-lose-the-elections/)==.

## Broader Trends
1. **Unifying Opposition Coalitions:** In both Poland and Spain, opposition parties overcame ideological differences to form broad coalitions against right-wing populists.
2. **Youth Engagement:** Younger generations increasingly favor progressive policies on climate change, equality, and democracy.
3. **Urban-Rural Divide:** Urban areas tend to reject far-right populism due to higher education levels and exposure to diversity.
4. **Economic Concerns:** In Finland and Spain, economic issues overshadowed identity politics, weakening far-right narratives.

These cases illustrate that strategic coalitions, targeted campaigns focusing on democratic values or economic stability, and demographic shifts can effectively counter extreme right-wing populism in democratic societies.

In the last five years, several democratic countries have witnessed the defeat of extreme right-wing populist parties or leaders. Here are some notable examples:

**Poland**: The 2023 elections in Poland marked the end of right-wing populist rule. The Law and Justice Party (PiS), which had been in power since 2015, was defeated by a broad coalition of opposition parties. This coalition included the Civic Coalition, the Third Way, and the New Left, which together secured a majority in the Sejm, Poland's lower house of parliament. The defeat of PiS was attributed to several factors, including voter fatigue with the party's policies, a desire for change, and effective mobilization by the opposition. The opposition's campaign focused on restoring democratic norms, judicial independence, and media freedom, which resonated with a significant portion of the electorate [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]].

**Finland**: In the 2024 European Parliament elections, the populist radical-right Finns Party experienced a significant setback, coming in sixth place nationally and losing 6.2% of its vote share compared to the previous election. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including internal party strife, a shift in voter preferences towards more centrist or left-leaning parties, and possibly a backlash against the party's more extreme positions [Herkman24LfinnPopulistLoss➔Z8X4PF32](zotero://select/library/items/Z8X4PF32).

**Spain**: While not a complete defeat, the far-right party Vox in Spain lost over 600,000 votes in the country's latest general election. However, the political landscape in Spain remains highly polarized, and Vox has an opportunity to regain ground in the upcoming European Parliament elections. The loss in the general election was partly due to strategic voting by the electorate to prevent a far-right government, as well as the influence of other parties' campaigns focusing on unity and moderation [Euronews24spainVoxRightEU➔UX6ZXAXR](zotero://select/library/items/UX6ZXAXR) ==[14](https://whogoverns.eu/in-polarised-spain-populists-win-even-when-they-lose-the-elections/)==.

**Demographic Factors**: 
- **Poland**: The opposition's success was partly due to mobilizing younger voters and urban dwellers who were more likely to support democratic values and were disillusioned with PiS's governance style [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]].
- **Finland**: The decline of the Finns Party might be linked to demographic shifts, with younger voters and those in urban areas showing less support for radical right-wing parties [Herkman24LfinnPopulistLoss➔Z8X4PF32](zotero://select/library/items/Z8X4PF32).
- **Spain**: The demographic factors influencing the election results are less clear, but the polarization suggests that age, education, and urban-rural divides play a role in voter preferences [Euronews24spainVoxRightEU➔UX6ZXAXR](zotero://select/library/items/UX6ZXAXR) ==[14](https://whogoverns.eu/in-polarised-spain-populists-win-even-when-they-lose-the-elections/)==.

**Campaign Effects**: 
- **Poland**: The opposition's campaign was effective in highlighting the need for democratic reforms and judicial independence, which appealed to voters concerned about the erosion of democratic norms under PiS [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]].
- **Finland**: The Finns Party's campaign might have been undermined by internal divisions and a failure to adapt to changing voter priorities [Herkman24LfinnPopulistLoss➔Z8X4PF32](zotero://select/library/items/Z8X4PF32).
- **Spain**: The campaigns of other parties, particularly those advocating for unity and moderation, likely influenced voters to strategically vote against Vox [Euronews24spainVoxRightEU➔UX6ZXAXR](zotero://select/library/items/UX6ZXAXR) ==[14](https://whogoverns.eu/in-polarised-spain-populists-win-even-when-they-lose-the-elections/)==.

These examples illustrate that while extreme right-wing populism has seen significant gains in some parts of Europe, there are also instances where democratic forces have successfully pushed back against such movements through effective campaigning, voter mobilization, and addressing key demographic concerns.

# o3mini.md
In the past five years, several democratic countries have seen the defeat of extreme right-wing populist parties or leaders in elections. These defeats often stemmed from high voter mobilization, strategic coalitions among opposition parties, and demographic shifts favoring progressive values, especially among younger voters. Below are key examples:

## **1. Poland (2023 Parliamentary Elections)**
The populist Law and Justice Party (PiS), which had ruled Poland since 2015, lost its majority in the October 2023 elections. Despite receiving the largest vote share (35%), PiS was unable to form a government due to a coalition of opposition parties led by Donald Tusk's Civic Coalition.

### **Causes of Defeat:**
- **Youth and Female Mobilization:** Record voter turnout (74.4%) included a surge in participation among young voters (69%, up from 46% in 2019) and women, many motivated by dissatisfaction with PiS's restrictive abortion laws and anti-LGBTQ+ policies [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]] ==[46](https://theconversation.com/young-female-voters-were-the-key-to-defeating-populists-in-polands-election-providing-a-blueprint-to-reverse-democracys-decline-216397)==.
- **EU Influence:** PiS's conflict with the European Union over rule-of-law issues and frozen EU funds alienated many voters who valued closer ties with Europe ==[58](https://www.cidob.org/en/publications/polands-democratic-comeback-and-spectre-national-populism)==.
- **Strategic Opposition Unity:** A coalition of pro-democracy parties effectively campaigned on restoring democratic norms and improving EU relations ==[31](https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/warschau/21049.pdf)== [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]].

### **Impact of Campaigns:**
Grassroots efforts, particularly targeting young voters and women, played a significant role. Civil society organizations and opposition leaders framed the election as a fight for democracy, resonating with urban and progressive demographics ==[46](https://theconversation.com/young-female-voters-were-the-key-to-defeating-populists-in-polands-election-providing-a-blueprint-to-reverse-democracys-decline-216397)==.

## **2. Spain (2023 General Elections)**
In July 2023, Spain's far-right Vox party suffered significant losses, dropping from 52 to 33 seats in parliament. This setback prevented the conservative Popular Party (PP) from forming a coalition government with Vox, allowing Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez to remain in power.

### **Causes of Defeat:**
- **Strategic Voting:** Many centrist and conservative voters shifted from Vox to the PP to avoid empowering far-right extremism ==[32](https://www.csis.org/analysis/whither-spain-july-2023-general-election-results-and-beyond)== ==[59](https://ggr.hias.hit-u.ac.jp/en/2023/12/27/2023-general-elections-in-spain/)==.
- **Rejection of Extremism:** Vox's hardline stances on immigration, gender rights, and regional autonomy alienated moderate voters ==[10](https://www.populismstudies.org/populism-in-2023-the-year-in-review/)== ==[29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party))==.
- **Historical Context:** Older generations who remembered Franco's dictatorship were wary of Vox's nationalist rhetoric ==[59](https://ggr.hias.hit-u.ac.jp/en/2023/12/27/2023-general-elections-in-spain/)==.

### **Impact of Campaigns:**
The PP ran a more moderate campaign, appealing to voters disillusioned with Vox's polarizing agenda. Additionally, Sánchez's government emphasized economic stability and progressive policies, which resonated with urban and younger voters ==[29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party))== ==[10](https://www.populismstudies.org/populism-in-2023-the-year-in-review/)==.

---

## **3. Italy (Local Setbacks for Far-Right Parties)**
While Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party leads the national government, far-right populists have faced challenges at local levels. For example, in some mayoral elections, moderate coalitions have successfully countered right-wing populist narratives.

### **Causes of Local Defeats:**
- **Fragmentation on the Right:** Rivalries among far-right parties like Brothers of Italy, Lega, and Forza Italia diluted their influence in some regions ==[11](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2022/09/how-a-far-right-victory-in-italy-might-ripple-through-the-eu?lang=en)== ==[55](https://www.promarket.org/2024/05/10/the-political-economy-of-populism-in-italy/)==.
- **Economic Concerns:** Rising inflation and dissatisfaction with national-level governance have sometimes weakened far-right support locally ==[60](https://theins.ru/en/economics/276464)==.

---

## **Demographic Factors Across Cases**
1. **Youth Voter Mobilization:** Younger voters overwhelmingly supported progressive or centrist parties in countries like Poland and Spain.
2. **Urban-Rural Divide:** Urban areas tended to reject far-right populism due to higher education levels and exposure to diverse populations.
3. **Women's Voting Patterns:** In Poland especially, women were pivotal in opposing PiS due to its restrictive social policies.

---

## **Broader Lessons**
The defeats of extreme right-wing populists highlight several key trends:
- High voter turnout is essential for countering populism.
- Opposition coalitions can effectively challenge entrenched populist governments.
- Campaigns emphasizing democratic values, social inclusion, and economic stability resonate with diverse demographics.

These cases demonstrate that while right-wing populism remains a potent force globally, it is not invincible when met with organized resistance and high civic engagement.

# PerPlexPro.md
In the last five years, extreme right-wing populist movements have faced notable electoral defeats in democratic countries such as Brazil and France. These cases illustrate the interplay of political strategies, demographic factors, and public sentiment in curbing the rise of far-right populism.

## **Brazil: Bolsonaro's Defeat in 2022**
In Brazil's 2022 presidential election, leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva narrowly defeated incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, marking a significant setback for far-right populism. Lula won with 50.9% of the vote, leveraging a broad coalition to counter Bolsonaro's polarizing rhetoric and governance ==[4](https://globalaffairs.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/brazils-systemic-mistrust-elections-and-democracy)== ==[79](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-votes-heated-bolsonaro-vs-lula-presidential-runoff-2022-10-30/)==.

### **Causes of Bolsonaro's Defeat**
1. **Public Discontent with Governance**: Bolsonaro's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and environmental policies alienated many voters. His administration was also criticized for corruption and economic stagnation ==[4](https://globalaffairs.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/brazils-systemic-mistrust-elections-and-democracy)== ==[79](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-votes-heated-bolsonaro-vs-lula-presidential-runoff-2022-10-30/)==.
2. **Broad Coalition Building**: Lula successfully united diverse ideological groups, appealing to voters across socioeconomic classes who viewed Bolsonaro as a threat to democracy ==[118](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12022)==.
3. **Demographic Shifts**: Bolsonaro retained support among wealthier and rural voters but lost ground among lower-income groups and urban areas that had previously supported him ==[120](https://jacobin.com/2022/10/brazil-first-round-presidential-elections-jair-bolsonaro-lula-da-silva)==.

### **Impact of Campaigns**
Lula's campaign emphasized restoring social mobility and democratic norms, resonating with voters disillusioned by Bolsonaro's divisive leadership. International confidence in Brazil's electoral system also played a role in legitimizing the results ==[118](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12022)==.

## **France: Blocking Marine Le Pen's National Rally in 2024**
In France, Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) party made significant gains in the 2024 European and legislative elections but failed to secure power due to strategic opposition coalitions. Despite winning a record number of seats in the National Assembly, RN was blocked by a "Republican front"—a coalition of centrist and left-wing parties aimed at preventing far-right governance ==[72](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/fastthinking/the-far-right-suffers-a-shocking-defeat-in-france/)== ==[121](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-french-voters-formed-a-republican-front-to-block-the-far-rights-path-to-victory)==.

### **Causes of RN's Setback**
1. **Strategic Alliances**: Centrist and leftist parties withdrew candidates in key constituencies to consolidate votes against RN in the second round of elections ==[121](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-french-voters-formed-a-republican-front-to-block-the-far-rights-path-to-victory)==.
2. **Public Resistance**: Many French voters remain wary of RN's historical ties to racism and extremism, despite efforts by Le Pen to rebrand the party ==[121](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-french-voters-formed-a-republican-front-to-block-the-far-rights-path-to-victory)== ==[124](https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/transatlantic-policy/articles/20240919-the-national-rallys-electoral-success.cfm)==.
3. **Economic Concerns**: RN capitalized on issues like immigration and cost-of-living crises but faced criticism for its divisive policies and potential economic risks ==[119](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/30/nx-s1-5024254/france-elections-far-right-national-rally-leads-macron-le-pen)== ==[124](https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/transatlantic-policy/articles/20240919-the-national-rallys-electoral-success.cfm)==.

### **Demographic Factors**
RN gained traction among younger voters (18-25 years old) and rural areas but faced resistance in urban centers where progressive coalitions were stronger ==[124](https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/transatlantic-policy/articles/20240919-the-national-rallys-electoral-success.cfm)== ==[126](https://www.statista.com/topics/9604/far-right-politics-in-france-2022/)==.

### **Campaign Effects**
The "Republican front" strategy proved effective, as it mobilized voters across ideological lines to block RN from achieving a parliamentary majority. This approach underscored the importance of unity among mainstream parties in countering far-right movements ==[121](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-french-voters-formed-a-republican-front-to-block-the-far-rights-path-to-victory)==.

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **Unified Opposition Matters**: Both cases highlight the effectiveness of broad coalitions (Brazil) or strategic alliances (France) in defeating far-right populists.
2. **Public Sentiment Against Extremism**: Discontent with divisive policies and governance failures often drives voters toward moderate or progressive alternatives.
3. **Demographic Shifts**: Urban-rural divides and generational differences play critical roles in shaping electoral outcomes.
4. **Campaign Framing**: Emphasizing democratic values, economic stability, and inclusivity can counteract far-right narratives.

These examples demonstrate that while far-right populism remains a potent force globally, strategic political coordination and public resistance can effectively limit its rise in democratic systems.

In recent years, several democratic countries have successfully countered far-right populist movements through electoral defeats. Below is an analysis of key cases, focusing on causes, campaign strategies, and demographic factors:

---

## **Spain (2023)**
### Defeat of Vox
- **Context**: The far-right Vox party surged in 2019 but underperformed in the July 2023 snap elections, losing 19 seats and failing to enter a coalition with the conservative Partido Popular (PP) ==[10](https://www.populismstudies.org/populism-in-2023-the-year-in-review/)== ==[133](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/spain-election-pedro-sanchez-analysis/)== ==[35](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spains-vox-party-stumbles-testing-limits-european-far-right-advance-2023-07-24/)==.
- **Causes**:
  - Vox’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, opposition to LGBTQ+ rights, and anti-feminist policies alienated urban and younger voters ==[128](https://www.politico.eu/article/spanish-government-pedro-sanchez-defeats-no-confidence-vote-brought-by-far-right-vox/)== ==[188](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/21/europe/spain-vox-womens-rights-intl/index.html)==.
  - Strategic mobilization by left-wing parties (PSOE and Sumar) framed the election as a defense of democracy against extremism ==[146](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/world/europe/spain-election-vox-party.html)== ==[152](https://jacobin.com/2023/07/spain-election-right-wing-defeat-vox-sumar-pedro-sanchez)==.
- **Campaigns**:
  - Progressive coalitions emphasized Vox’s threat to social liberties, leveraging slogans like *“No pasarán!”* (They shall not pass!) from Spain’s antifascist history ==[133](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/spain-election-pedro-sanchez-analysis/)== ==[152](https://jacobin.com/2023/07/spain-election-right-wing-defeat-vox-sumar-pedro-sanchez)==.
  - Grassroots movements and feminist organizations highlighted Vox’s regressive gender policies, mobilizing women and youth ==[188](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/21/europe/spain-vox-womens-rights-intl/index.html)== ==[192](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10081776/)==.
- **Demographics**:
  - High turnout among women (74.7%) and voters under 35, particularly in urban areas ==[133](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/spain-election-pedro-sanchez-analysis/)== ==[185](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/spain-has-stopped-far-right-vox-party-now)==.
  - Vox’s support skewed toward older, rural voters with lower education levels, while progressive parties dominated cities like Madrid and Barcelona ==[189](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2020/07/30/who-are-vox-and-who-are-their-voters/)== ==[61](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/122078/1/Kuppers_the_far_right_in_spain_published.pdf)==.

## **Poland (2023)**
### Defeat of Law and Justice (PiS)
- **Context**: The national-conservative PiS party lost its parliamentary majority after 8 years in power, replaced by a coalition led by Donald Tusk’s Civic Platform ==[134](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-bye-to-pis-and-hello-to-donald-tusk/)== ==[161](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/polands-democratic-resurgence-from-backsliding-to-beacon/)== ==[182](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/11/europe/poland-pis-confidence-vote-tusk-intl/index.html)==.
- **Causes**:
  - Backlash against PiS’s erosion of judicial independence and restrictive abortion laws, which triggered mass protests led by women and youth ==[161](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/polands-democratic-resurgence-from-backsliding-to-beacon/)== ==[174](https://europeandemocracyhub.epd.eu/the-end-of-polands-illiberal-experiment/)== ==[46](https://theconversation.com/young-female-voters-were-the-key-to-defeating-populists-in-polands-election-providing-a-blueprint-to-reverse-democracys-decline-216397)==.

## **Estonia (2023)**
### Defeat of EKRE
- **Context**: The far-right Conservative People’s Party (EKRE) lost ground in the March 2023 parliamentary election, finishing second to Prime Minister Kaja Kallas’s Reform Party ==[135](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20230305-estonian-prime-minister-s-center-right-party-wins-general-election)== ==[145](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/estonian-prime-ministers-reform-party-gains-big-victory-in-parliamentary-election)== ==[186](https://geopolitique.eu/en/articles/parliamentary-election-in-estonia-5-march-2023/)==.
- **Causes**:
  - EKRE’s ambivalence toward Russia and opposition to aiding Ukraine alienated voters amid heightened security concerns post-invasion ==[157](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/five-takeaways-from-the-estonian-elections-where-security-trumped-inflation-by-a-landslide/)== ==[163](https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2023-03-06/estonia-reform-party-wins-parliamentary-election)== ==[187](https://www.populismstudies.org/the-impact-of-the-russia-ukraine-war-on-right-wing-populism-in-estonia/)==.

- **Campaigns**:
  - Kallas’s Reform Party emphasized Estonia’s NATO ties and framed EKRE as a threat to national security ==[148](https://www.euronews.com/2023/03/06/estonia-election-analysis-why-the-liberals-won-the-far-right-lost-and-other-key-takeaways)== ==[186](https://geopolitique.eu/en/articles/parliamentary-election-in-estonia-5-march-2023/)==.
  - Fact-checking initiatives countered EKRE’s disinformation on immigration and economic policy ==[148](https://www.euronews.com/2023/03/06/estonia-election-analysis-why-the-liberals-won-the-far-right-lost-and-other-key-takeaways)== ==[165](https://portal.vifanord.de/blog/estonian-general-election-2023-a-choice-between-mostly-centre-right-liberalism-and-far-right-populism/)==.

## **Key Patterns**
### Institutional Resilience
- **Checks and balances**: In Spain and Poland, constitutional courts and opposition coalitions limited populists’ power grabs ==[127](https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/915348)== ==[174](https://europeandemocracyhub.epd.eu/the-end-of-polands-illiberal-experiment/)==.
- **EU influence**: Frozen funds and pressure on Poland’s PiS to restore rule of law galvanized pro-EU voters ==[161](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/polands-democratic-resurgence-from-backsliding-to-beacon/)== ==[169](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/liberal-poland-is-back-the-impact-on-europe-of-the-2023-polish-vote/)==.

### Demographic Shifts
- **Youth and women**: Higher turnout among these groups consistently countered populists, driven by concerns over civil liberties and economic equity ==[133](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/spain-election-pedro-sanchez-analysis/)== ==[46](https://theconversation.com/young-female-voters-were-the-key-to-defeating-populists-in-polands-election-providing-a-blueprint-to-reverse-democracys-decline-216397)== ==[193](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/10/30/how-pis-lost-power-in-its-heartland/)==.
- **Urban-rural divide**: Populists retained rural strongholds but lost cities where education levels and exposure to progressive media were higher ==[189](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2020/07/30/who-are-vox-and-who-are-their-voters/)== ==[193](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/10/30/how-pis-lost-power-in-its-heartland/)==.

### Campaign Strategies
- **Coalition-building**: Opposition alliances (e.g., Spain’s PSOE-Sumar, Poland’s Civic Coalition) diluted populist messaging ==[152](https://jacobin.com/2023/07/spain-election-right-wing-defeat-vox-sumar-pedro-sanchez)== ==[166](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2023/10/24/what-we-learned-from-the-2023-polish-election/)==.
- **Narrative framing**: Linking populists to external threats (e.g., Russia in Estonia, authoritarianism in Poland) proved effective ==[148](https://www.euronews.com/2023/03/06/estonia-election-analysis-why-the-liberals-won-the-far-right-lost-and-other-key-takeaways)== ==[169](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/liberal-poland-is-back-the-impact-on-europe-of-the-2023-polish-vote/)==.

These cases illustrate that while far-right populism remains a potent force, democratic institutions, strategic opposition campaigns, and shifting demographics can curb its advance. However, continued vigilance is necessary, as populists often adapt by exploiting new crises or polarizing issues ==[140](https://www.socialeurope.eu/why-populists-are-winning-the-broken-promise-of-liberal-democracy)== ==[142](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/combating-populism)==.

# sonar.md
In the last five years, there have been instances where extreme right-wing populists have faced setbacks in democratic countries. Here are some examples:

## 1. **Poland**
In October 2023, Poland's ruling right-wing populist Law and Justice Party (PiS) lost power to a broad coalition of opposition parties. This shift was partly due to economic concerns and dissatisfaction with the PiS's governance style [[Gora23polandEndRightWing|Gora23polandEndRightWing]].

- **Causes**: Economic factors, such as rising inflation and living costs, played a significant role. Additionally, the PiS's authoritarian tendencies and conflicts with the EU contributed to its decline.
- **Campaigns**: The opposition's campaign focused on economic stability and restoring democratic norms, which resonated with voters.
- **Demographic Factors**: Urban voters and younger generations were key in supporting the opposition coalition.

## 2. **Finland**
In the 2024 European Parliament elections, the populist radical-right Finns Party experienced a significant decline, losing 6.2% of its vote share and coming sixth nationally [Herkman24LfinnPopulistLoss➔Z8X4PF32](zotero://select/library/items/Z8X4PF32).

- **Causes**: The party's internal divisions and lack of clear policy positions may have contributed to its decline. Additionally, the Finnish electorate's general satisfaction with the current government's performance could have reduced support for populist alternatives.
- **Campaigns**: The Finns Party's inability to effectively campaign on key issues like immigration and economic policies might have hindered its performance.
- **Demographic Factors**: The party traditionally draws support from rural areas and older voters, but these demographics may have been less mobilized in the European elections.

## 3. **Spain**
While not a complete defeat, Spain's far-right party Vox lost significant ground in the latest general election, losing over 600,000 votes [Euronews24spainVoxRightEU➔UX6ZXAXR](zotero://select/library/items/UX6ZXAXR). This decline suggests that Vox's populist appeal may be waning.

- **Causes**: Economic recovery and a shift in public opinion towards more moderate political options could have contributed to Vox's decline.
- **Campaigns**: The main parties focused on economic stability and social cohesion, which may have undercut Vox's populist narrative.
- **Demographic Factors**: Urban and educated voters tend to support more moderate parties, contributing to Vox's decline.

## Conclusion
The defeats of extreme right-wing populists in these countries often result from a combination of economic dissatisfaction, opposition to authoritarian tendencies, and effective campaigning by moderate parties. Demographic factors, such as urban vs. rural divides and generational differences, also play significant roles in shaping electoral outcomes. Empirical studies from institutions like Pew and academic journals highlight these trends, emphasizing the importance of economic stability and democratic governance in countering populist movements ==[7](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/12/11/global-elections-in-2024-what-we-learned-in-a-year-of-political-disruption/)== ==[8](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/06/populists-in-europe-especially-those-on-the-right-have-increased-their-vote-shares-in-recent-elections/)== ==[13](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-populist-challenge-to-liberal-democracy/)==.
