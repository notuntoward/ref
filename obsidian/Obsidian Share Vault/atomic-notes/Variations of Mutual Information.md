# Variations of Mutual Information
Several variations of mutual information exist, including:
- **Conditional mutual information**: Measures MI conditioned on a third variable.
- **Adjusted mutual information**: Adjusts MI for random partitions, yielding a scale from 0 to 1 based on distributions' identity.

These variations cater to specific analytical needs in different contexts.
