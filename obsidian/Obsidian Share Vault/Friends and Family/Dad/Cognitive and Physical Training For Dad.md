## Training available in Minnesota

### Physical Training
From: [I am looking for group classes...](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-am-looking-for-group-classes-5ifSbi9MT7GSRm8TGKe3MA#0)

*I am looking for group classes for seniors experiencing mild cognitive impairment.  These should meet regularly, like exercise classes typically do.  They can involve either brain exercises or physical exercises, like strength training, that have shown cognitive effects.  I'd prefer that the class be as close as possible to Alexandria, MN, but would consider anything in Minnesota.*

For seniors in or near Alexandria, MN with mild cognitive impairment, there are several group class options involving both brain and physical exercises—many of which meet regularly and are tailored to promote both cognitive and overall well-being.
#### ==Alexandria Area YMCA==
This local YMCA offers an ==evidence-based ForeverWell== program with regular classes in strength training, balance, flexibility, and even aqua exercise, all tailored to older adults. These group sessions foster social engagement, support varying ability levels, and address both physical and cognitive health, making them especially suitable for seniors with mild cognitive impairment. The close proximity and comprehensive, ongoing schedule are major advantages.

#### Live 2 B Healthy Senior Fitness Classes
Live 2 B Healthy specializes in group fitness for seniors, including specialized Memory Care classes that combine gentle exercise, cognitive stimulation, and socialization. Classes can be found in senior living communities and may include options in Alexandria or nearby areas. This provider stands out for their certified trainers, evidence-based programs, and focus on both cognitive and physical aspects—though availability may depend on local partnerships.

#### ==HABIT Program at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN)==
The renowned HABIT Program is a 10-day, multi-component wellness program at Mayo Clinic specifically for individuals with mild cognitive impairment and their support partners. While not ongoing like weekly exercise classes, this program offers intensive group sessions covering yoga, memory training, brain fitness, and wellness education, with proven benefits for building habits that can be continued long-term. Its primary drawback is the concentrated format, but it is the most comprehensive, evidence-based brain-and-body program in the state.

#### Vista Prairie at Windmill Ponds (Alexandria, MN)
This non-profit senior community provides Memory Care with regular, structured activities tailored for residents with cognitive challenges. While primarily designed for residents, these programs prioritize safety, engagement, and cognitive stimulation in a group setting. The advantage is the local, supportive environment—though participation may require residence or formal enrollment.

#### Mind and Body Class at Saint Therese (Minneapolis, MN)
Saint Therese offers a 'Mind and Body' class that specifically integrates exercises for balance, strength, flexibility, and cognitive tasks such as multitasking, reasoning, and memory—ideal for seniors with mild cognitive impairment. The regular schedule and trained staff are major benefits, though it is less local to Alexandria.

#### ARORA Classes at Life Time (Maple Grove, MN)
ARORA offers senior-focused group classes with strength training and neuroplasticity drills designed to support both physical and mental health. Their beginner-friendly and regular format is excellent for cognitive engagement and social interaction, though the drive from Alexandria may be a factor.
### Cognitive and Physical Training

*This is a good list. Find others which are likely to provide the rigorous strength training program that was used in the attached paper and/or cognitive training as in the MEMO+ in the other attached paper. Then report again the list of courses you have found in words as you have already done, as well as in a table with columns for aspects of the classes. Rank and sort the classes by suitability to purpose. I greatly prefer in-person. Don't forget the table. Earlier, you found a well-matching program in Duluth, MN. Include it too.*
#### Most Promising Minnesota Classes for Seniors with Mild Cognitive Impairment

(the higher the rank, the closer the match to rigorous resistance training and/or structured cognitive training, and the to Alexandria)

#### How to Use the List

1. **Start local** – Vital Fit Club requires no travel and replicates progressive loading used in the resistance-training RCT.
2. **Layer in cognitive work** – If you want a true MEMO+-style cognitive class, invite the MN-based Fit Minds coach for an on-site group, or join a BrainHQ class via your health plan.
3. **Add variety or higher frequency** – Consider Live 2 B Healthy or SAIL to fill days between heavier sessions; both are low- to no-cost and travel to multiple Alexandria senior communities.
4. **Road-trip options** – For a structured 12-week YMCA course, Duluth offers the strongest regional match (ForeverWell) and was the program you noted previously.

All nine run **predominantly in person**, align with published evidence on resistance or cognitive training for mild cognitive impairment, and can be combined or sequenced to match individual tolerance and scheduling preferences.
