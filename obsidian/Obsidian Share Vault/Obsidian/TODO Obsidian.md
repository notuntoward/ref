# Zotero interface
- [ ] [[2024-02-25#Zotero Integration Plugin|Zotero Integration Plugin]] template is getting the pdf and html attachment filenames from the displayed zotero attachment name, not the citekey.
# Obsidian Navigation and Linking
- [ ] Get rid of (incorrect) "web view" text in links to OneNote pages
- [ ] Hotkey for Advanced URI to block.  Is "to page" also needed?
- [ ] Replace bookmarks I made in [[House Rewire Permit Procedure Steps]] with advanced URI to block links
- [ ] Macro that links to block similar to my dedicated target elisp in Emacs: Maybe both for external links and internal 
      See: [Every USEFUL Markdown Syntax That I Use in Obsidian](https://youtu.be/d8fXEhWy_rY?t=196)
- [ ] Find all useful Obsidian commands that can be hotkeyed.  Is this it?

- [ ] Reply to HTML-importer guy (Obsidian as Evernote)
- [x] Reply to other Obsidian plugin author
- [ ] Obsidian feature request for Obsidian as Evernote: mention Zotero7 storing html, on principle
- [ ] Obsidian feature request for allowing text between bullets (can do text between headlines, but I also want it between bullets)
- [ ] Find headline/bullet navigating commands in Obsidian  ^bes3
	- [ ] get list from my comment: [Obsidian <-> org-mode rosetta stone - Help - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-org-mode-rosetta-stone/65019/2?u=scotto)
	- [ ] request them from the [obsidian-editor-shortcuts](https://github.com/timhor/obsidian-editor-shortcuts) plugin
		- [ ] collapse/expand all H1s is nowhere near the list
		- [ ] need multilevel (like some other blog commentor mentioned)
		- [ ] also do the same for obsidian **Bullets**

# Attachments
-  If I make a .attachments folder, it's ignored, and attached pdfs to into the top of the vault. #bugObsid 
- zotero integration pdf paths are absolute #todoObsid
- no good way to do a simple TODO list #todoObsid
