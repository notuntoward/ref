From: [(4) How to resize a pasted image? : ObsidianMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/mi52wl/how_to_resize_a_pasted_image/)

At least two ways:

1. **Link Editing**: If the pasted image is linked like so: \[\[imageURL.png\]\]  then you just add '|' and the pixel width you want at the end of the UR e.g. for 500 pixels, you'd edit the link to  
   
         \[\[imageURL.png|500\]\]   
   
2. **Mouse Wheel**: Use [mousewheel image zoom plugin](https://github.com/nicojeske/mousewheel-image-zoom) : Â hover over the image, press alt and scroll mouse, the image size adjusts accordingly
