# Disc Brake Pads

## Fin Brake Pads for German Cube Gravel Bike

I originally bought the now-discontinued Shimano LO2A Resin Pads; the replacement (10/2/24) is [said](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-replacement-part-f-Sulf7n6.RimcYFBDg5nxOg) to be the [Shimano L05A-RF](https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/service-upgradeparts/shimano/WO-EBPL05ARFA.html)

Here's the **<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">LO2A package</span>**, which has dimensions and stuff on it.
