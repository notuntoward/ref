I asked:

> I am planning to move literature notes inside of zotero to my Obsidian vault.  The obsidian integration plugin will help with part of this; it will copy the zotero literature notes to new obsidian literature notes. The problem is the zotero: links.  The literature notes copied to obsidian will still have zotero: links in them but with everything moved to obsidian, those links show now point to the new obsidian literature notes.  In addition, I have many existing obsidian pages that which have zotero: links which  should also point to obsidian notes instead.

> How have people solved this problem?  Are there obsidian or zotero plugins that could help?  Are there python libraries that people have used for this?

## Copilot
There are several ways to integrate Zotero and Obsidian, and some of them might help you solve your problem:¬†
1. Zotero Integration Plugin: This plugin allows you to import citations, bibliographies, and PDF annotations from Zotero into Obsidian[1](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd)[2](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration). It's essential for workflows that involve moving literature notes from Zotero to Obsidian[1](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd).
2. Zotero to <span style="color:#ffc000">Readwise Python Library</span>: The zotero2readwise Python library retrieves all Zotero annotations and notes and automatically uploads them to Readwise[12](https://bing.com/search?q=how+to+move+Zotero+notes+to+Obsidian). Although it's not directly related to Obsidian, it might be useful if you're using Readwise to manage your literature notes.¬†
3. <span style="color:#ffc000">Obsidian Tools Python Library</span>: The obsidiantools Python library provides structured metadata about your Obsidian notes and analyses your vault[13](https://obsidian-zotero-docs.vercel.app/getting-started/basic-usage/annotation-import). It might be useful for managing your notes after they've been moved from Zotero to Obsidian.¬†
4. Manual Export and Import: You can manually export your Zotero notes to markdown files and then import them into Obsidian[11](https://ricraftis.au/obsidian/how-to-integrate-zotero-with-obsidian/). This method might be time-consuming, but it gives you full control over the process.¬†

There are a couple of approaches to tackle the broken Zotero links in your Obsidian vault after migrating literature notes:

**Plugins:**
- **Obsidian Zotero Integration Plugin (formerly Obsidian Zotero Desktop Connector):** This plugin you already mentioned can be helpful for part of the solution. It offers a "literature note" creation feature that automatically creates new Obsidian notes based on Zotero entries. While it won't fix existing broken links, it can ensure future notes have the correct Obsidian internal links.
- @ **Pandoc Filter with Obsidian Pandoc Plugin:** This approach requires some technical knowledge. You can use the Obsidian Pandoc plugin along with a <span style="color:#ffc000">custom Pandoc filter written in Lua</span> to remove or convert the "zotero:" prefix in your links. This will transform them into standard Obsidian internal links. Resources like the Obsidian forum discussions can help you find existing Lua filter code for this purpose.

**Manual Search and Replace:**
- This is a simpler option, but can be time-consuming for large vaults. You can use Obsidian's built-in search and replace functionality to find all instances of "zotero:" and replace them with the correct format for Obsidian internal links (usually double square brackets with the filename).

**Python Libraries:**
For a more automated solution using Python, libraries like "obsidian-api" or "zotero.py" can be explored. These libraries allow you to interact with your Obsidian vault and Zotero data programmatically. However, this approach has a steeper learning curve and requires some Python coding experience.

Here are some additional resources you might find helpful:
