# Manual
 Copy a zotero link in zotero, then paste it into obsidian and build the link by hand.  This is one way of making a link to pdf instead of to zotero entry.
- Install zutilo (zotero pluging)
- create a [link](https://youtu.be/VqOc9OsMX_s?t=1131)
	- cursor on entry for entry
	- cursor on pdf for pdf
	- right click --> "copy select item links"
## Totally Manual: type your own markdown syntax
- paste zotero link into obsidian and hack
	- edit link to make complete markdown link
		- entry: will open zotero entry
		- pdf: won't open the pdf, will only point to zotero attachment entry
	- make it open pdf on a page with [extra link edit](https://youtu.be/VqOc9OsMX_s?t=1180) (I didn't get this to work)
- More info on this in the org-mode howto.org Zutilo heading
## Semi-Manual: paste over existing text
Avoids messing with markdown syntax.
- Select some text on the obsidian page. 
	- This will be the link link text
	- You can type this first and then do the paste
- Paste
- A link will be created (via one of the zotero plugins I've installed, too lazy to look it up)
