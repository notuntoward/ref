Mutual information (MI) is a measure of the mutual dependence between two random variables. It quantifies the amount of information obtained about one variable by observing the other[4]. In other words, MI measures how much knowing one variable reduces uncertainty about the other[6].

Key points about mutual information:

1. It detects any type of relationship between variables, not just linear associations[2].
2. MI is measured in units such as bits, nats, or hartleys[4].
3. It is always non-negative and symmetric[4].
4. MI is zero if and only if the variables are independent[4].

To calculate mutual information from data:

1. For discrete variables:
   - Estimate joint probabilities from the frequency of co-occurrences[5].
   - Calculate marginal probabilities for each variable.
   - Use the formula: MI = Î£ p(x,y) * log(p(x,y) / (p(x) * p(y)))[4].

2. For continuous variables:
   - Use methods like binning or kernel density estimation to discretize the data.
   - Apply mutual_info_regression from scikit-learn[2].

3. For mixed variable types:
   - Use mutual_info_classif from scikit-learn, specifying discrete_features parameter[2].

Python example using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_regression, mutual_info_classif

# For continuous variables
mi_continuous = mutual_info_regression(X, y)

# For discrete variables
mi_discrete = mutual_info_classif(X, y, discrete_features=True)
```

Mutual information is a powerful tool for feature selection and understanding relationships between variables in machine learning and data analysis[2][7].
