# Sheet Plus Plugin
From: [GitHub - ljcoder2015/obsidian-...](https://github.com/ljcoder2015/obsidian-sheet-plus)
- [ ] try it
# Task List Plugin
From: [GitHub - chrskerr/task-list-ka...](https://github.com/chrskerr/task-list-kanban)

I thought it had too much popup stuff, and that it intruded too much into the note.  Maybe if I got really serious about task management...

Also see [[2024-07-18#Task List Kanban Plugin|Task List Kanban Plugin]]

**Uninstalled.** Reconsider if I ever get serious about tasks.

# Leader Hotkeys Plugin
From: [GitHub - tgrosinger/leader-hot...](https://github.com/tgrosinger/leader-hotkeys-obsidian)

I don't know what this is supposed to do -- even after I installed it -- but it was recommended as some kind of a workaround by  [[2024-06-18#Emacs Text Editor Plugin|Emacs Text Editor Plugin]]

**Uninstalled.**
