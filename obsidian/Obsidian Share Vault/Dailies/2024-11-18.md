# Obsidian Web Clipper Plugin
From: [GitHub - obsidianmd/obsidian-c...](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-clipper)

Official obsidian web clipper browser extension with documentation that seems to say it can save all web page text (markdown with no pictures) and the highlights. But I can only get it to save highlighted text alone — that may come eventually.

# Literature Search and Analysis Tools
## ResearchRabbit web service
From: [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/)

Makes a graph of papers with authors as edges, but doesn't immediately give cited/refed papers like [[#Connected Papers web service|Connected Papers web service]] or [[#Litmaps web service|Litmaps web service]]. Seems like it has buttons for it, but they're grayed out. Does sort by earlier work and later work

- totally free
- imports categories categories and paper entries from Zotero
- can get pdfs from this
## Litmaps web service
From: [Litmaps | Your Literature Revi...](https://www.litmaps.com/)

Give it a paper and it will find citers and citees. Is a freemium, and the free version is pretty limited, while the paid versions seem quite expensive for what this is. I signed up to try it.

## Elicit web service
From: [Elicit: The AI Research Assist...](https://elicit.com/)

Type in your question and will find related papers, and put them in a table with descriptive columns you describe with genAI prompts.  

- I tried it and my first result was ==*very impressive*==
- Free version is pretty limited, most expensive paid is expensive

## Connected Papers web service
From: [Connected Papers | Find and ex...](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)

A lot like [[#Litmaps web service|Litmaps web service]] except doesn't literal refs and cites, but refs and cites of the cluster your target paper is in (I think that's right). This seems better.

- Free version very limited; medium expensive non-free
- Guess I'd tried this b/f but I forgot about it

## docAnalyzer.AI web service
From: [docAnalyzer.ai | AI that works...](https://docanalyzer.ai/)

Similar to Google's [[NotebookLM]] ([[Forte24googleNotebookLM]]), but is more strict about prompt specificity. You ask a question and it answers based on the set of papers you've uploaded to it.

- points to the *page* of the paper that has the info justifying its answer, not the sentence, like [[NotebookLM]]
- Free is less limited than usual (but [[NotebookLM]] is totally unlimited); basic is not too bad: $6/mo.
- Not sure if its context window is huge like NotebookLM — unlikely since everybody says NotebookLM is the biggest
- Paid version has an API, unlike [[NotebookLM]]
- At least on free version, uses the mini versions of LLMs
- non-API pdf upload is tedious, like in [[NotebookLM]]
- page is it's a Beta version.
- I managed one unimpressive chat, and then I could not get it to chat again. Not sure if was a Free plan limit or a bug

## Lens.org web service
From: [The Lens - Free & Open Patent ...](https://www.lens.org/)

A kind of old fashioned joint patent and literature search tool, seems keyword base, but has real-time dashboard of keywords or something.

- there is a free non-profit pro license or a free open public one
- A chunk of video about it: [AI Just Made Literature Review...](https://youtu.be/cN_gqxLMkNY?t=206)
## Semantic Scholar
From: [Semantic Scholar | AI-Powered ...](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)

Like google scholar, totally free

- guy below says many of the lit review services actually use this at the bottom

## Storm Stanford Lit research
From: [https://storm.genie.stanford.e...](https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/)

A paper finder with a chat interface, but I couldn't get it to work. Sent a bug report. A too-experimental experiment from Stanford.
