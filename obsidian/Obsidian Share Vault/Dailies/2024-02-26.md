# # G-PST/ESIG Webinar: Advances in the Use of Probabilistic Resource Adequacy Methods

## My Notes

- Speaker: Aidan Tuohy, EPRI
- Many EPRI reports on what was covered in this talk are [here](https://www.epri.com/search#q=resource%20adequacy&t=research&sort=relevancy).
- long term resource adequacy has increased in NAm.  
	- Where
		- High risk in what looks like MISO, 
		- the West has elevated risk; 
		- SE US looks good.
	- A lot is winter capacity
	- Causes
		- more variable capacity (RES)
		- less firm available
		- increased electricity reliance
		- transmission "interactions"
- So, there's  big "resource adequacy initiative"
	- lots of orgs, like NYISO, MISO, Duke Energy
	- Will do case studies and tactical initiatives (I think)
		- 6 foundational case studies: Western US, TX, MISO, ...
			- can download them from epri.com
			- about: climate, storage, transmission, metrics, ...
- Today's focus: tactical
- Resource Adequacy Modeling
	- Level I-III: levels of accuracy/complexity
		- examples of what is at each level for thermal gen and transmission
		- in Q&A he said ISO's are more level II now
- Storage Modeling
	- SPP/TX/Western case studies were done
	- studied e.g. impact of lookahead in storage (scheduling, I think)
		- "lookahead" means perfect forecast for x hours ahead
	- TX scheduling
		- different PLEXOS dispatch optimization goals
			- time of shortfall
			- depth of shortfall
			- ...
			- in Q&A, he says that probably need multiple metrics: systems w/ same LOLE can have very different outage behavior: good or bad
		- weather dependent outages increase LOLE
	- Western US long-duration (multi-day) penetration modeling
		- they thought a week of foresight was realistic for optimization window
		- study showed that needed a depletion penalty (battery dump) to prevent something
		- Looked at sensitivity to hydro and weather years
			- showed: combo of bad weather and bad weather resulted in really big shortfalls
			- high VRE / "multi-day storage" decresed # bad years but shortage events much larger compared to high VRE + "storage"
				- I wasn't sure why this would be
				- was it b/c of what optimization was done?
- Data available
	- summary slides, and model levels
	- but I'm not sure where to get it, or which will actually be downloadable when study complete
- Software 
	- This is in some document on EPRI page today
	- a survey of software tools
		- a few were open source
	- Outage modeling
		- summary slide on best practices
		- maybe relevant to AEMO price forecasting?
	- Tool selection criteria: cost, interface, CPU, ...
	- 
- Gaps document
	- stuff we don't know how to do, not just that we haven't done yet
	- says they are load forecasting, ... I suppose this is years-ahead, not hours-ahead

About the Webinar: Ensuring resource adequacy – a measure of whether the current, or projected, resource mix is sufficient to meet capacity and energy needs for a particular grid– is crucial for ensuring a reliable energy transition. Probabilistic approaches have traditionally been used to assess resource adequacy, but in light of the changing nature of the resource mix, increased demand participation and the recent implications of extreme events, there is a need to revisit how resource adequacy is assessed. As recent events have shown, existing methods, models and tools for assessing resource adequacy do not always accurately portray risk and identify the potential for shortfalls, particularly during periods of extreme system stress such as cold weather. In this webcast, we will hear about the recently completed EPRI Resource Adequacy for a Decarbonized Future Initiative (www.epri.com/resource-adequacy). This project, which ran from mid-2021 to end of 2023, addressed a number of issues and challenges related to resource adequacy (RA). As resources such as wind/PV, batteries, demand flexibility and hybrids, as well as future resources such as hydrogen and long duration storage, enter the system, models and tools need to be able to include their characteristics compared to traditional resources. EPRI’s project built on other ongoing industry work, including the ESIG Resource Adequacy Task Force, and focused on a few main workstreams. A Process workstream focused on the metrics, criteria and scenarios used in RA studies. Here, recommendations on metrics to be assessed and the insights they provide were described, while methods for identifying short and long term scenarios to be studied were developed. A Models and Data workstream investigated existing and emerging approaches to model supply and demand side resources, as well as data required to characterize these resources. Recommended approaches were then provided, with different levels of detail based on how important a given resource type is to the system being studied. A Software Tools workstream surveyed existing and emerging tools for RA assessment, with the result being a greater understanding of current capabilities of commercial and research grade software, as well as new approaches and gaps. Underlying all of these workstreams, Case Studies of 6 different North American systems were used to support the material developed and identify how risk is evolving in each area.
