# HTML Reader Plugin
From: [GitHub - nuthrash/obsidian-htm...](https://github.com/nuthrash/obsidian-html-plugin)

Paste an html file into and obsidian vault, and this plugin will display it.

**Installed**  I use it all the time to read stored SingleFile web pages from Zotero.

# YTranscript Plugin
From: [obsidian-yt-transcript](https://github.com/lstrzepek/obsidian-yt-transcript)

Puts up a configurable, timestamped transcript.  You can drag this into your notes.  It's good.

- type-in popup for YT URL, or gets it from selected URL text
- can copy ALL into your note
- a click on the timestamp and it pops up a new browser tab at that time (**duplicate browser tabs are annoying**)
- [attempts at combining](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/takeing-video-notes-via-media-extend-and-obsidian-yt-transcript/74926/2) it with [[2024-04-03#Media Extended plugin]]
- [tips/feature request for opening a media-extended side pane](https://github.com/lstrzepek/obsidian-yt-transcript/issues/52#issue-2392909989) instead of a new browser tab
	- just replaceÂ `&t=`Â withÂ `#t=`Â in the timestamped links

**Installed**, it's not bad
# Reclipped Original Plugin
From: [GitHub - tech-reclipped/ReClip...](https://github.com/tech-reclipped/ReClipped-Obsidian-Official)

The companion obsidian plugin to the [reclipped browser extension](https://reclipped.com/) that I thought was the best of breed for browser extensions, maybe last year.   On Browser, you download whole transcript, past screenshots, etc.  and this can all be synced to a single obsidian folder in markdown.  You can paste that into your lit note (or append, I think there's and obsidian plugin for that too).

- Using it would be a little like using SingleFile as an html editor
- except that the plugin's Obsidian `Sync you data now` command only copies your annotations; any edits you do in obsidian aren't synced back.
- Can paste in screenshots either on the web page or later in the obsidian note
- Will show you the transcript, But I don't see a way to download the whole thing
- Chunks of transcripts can be "highlighted," causing them to "sync" down to Obsidian when you run the command
- When you open synced obsidian note, an obsidian video side pane opens, and responds when you click on timestamps

- You can paste chunks of the notes into any note, and the pane will response to the timestamps there, but you have to have the pane already opened and to the right video
	- Seems to open the panel based on you clicking on the note it makes and syncs -- not the note you have pasted it to.  Annoying b/c I don't like that "all notes of the same type in the same folder" organization
	- not as good as [[2024-04-03#Media Extended plugin]] because the only way the right side pane opens is if you open the synced note, not any other note.
	- [x] would the right panel open if I embedded the notes in the lit note?
		- Nope.  The timestamp buttons are clickable but it doesn't change the panel

### Are These Trump Voters Getting What They Voted For? (with Mark Leibovich) | The Focus Group Podcast

![Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/aA0a3YjcVxQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

ðŸ‘¤ [The Bulwark](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG4Hp1KbGw4e02N7FpPXDgQ)  ðŸ”— [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA0a3YjcVxQ)
#### Summary
The podcast episode features Sarah Longwell and Mark Leibovich discussing Donald Trump's first 100 days in office after being elected again, focusing on how voters, particularly those who switched from Biden to Trump, are reacting. The conversation covers Trump's approval ratings, the perceived lack of direction from the Democratic party, and the impact of Trump's communication style. They analyze voter reactions to Trump's speeches, the normalization of Trump's behavior, and the potential negative consequences of his policies, such as tariffs, on the economy.
#### Key points
- Voters are split regarding Trump's first 100 days. Some are hopeful and appreciate the action, while others are concerned about the economy and the speed of changes.
- Many voters are more focused on their negative perceptions of the Democratic party than on the substance of Trump's policies.
- Voters who switched from Biden to Trump are starting to express concerns about the fast pace of changes and potential negative impacts on the economy.
- Tariffs are a significant concern for voters, especially regarding their potential impact on the automotive sector and consumer prices.
- The Democratic party is perceived as lacking strong leadership and effective messaging.
- Trump's communication style, although unconventional, has created a parasocial relationship with his voters, filling a void left by the Biden administration's more reserved approach.
- Trump's economic policies may have adverse personal consequences to real people.
#### Technical terms
- **[[LIFO (Last In, First Out)]]**: A method of inventory valuation where the last items added to the inventory are the first ones to be sold or used. In the context of the podcast, it is used as a metaphor for the voters who most recently joined the Trump camp, suggesting they are the most likely to swing back.
- **[[Parasocial relationship]]**: A one-sided interpersonal relationship in which one party invests time, energy, and emotion while the other party is unaware of their existence. In the context of the podcast, it describes the kind of relationship Trump has with his voters due to his media presence.

#### Conclusion
The initial reactions to Trump's return to office are mixed, with some voters enthusiastic about the changes and others expressing concerns about the economy and the speed of policy implementation. The Democratic party needs to find new leaders and improve their communication strategy to effectively challenge Trump. The long-term impact of Trump's policies, particularly tariffs, remains to be seen and could significantly influence voter sentiment.

# Transcription Plugin

A transcription-from-file plugin.  So I guess you could download a youtube video?  Maybe good for lecture, zoom, or meeting transcription?
