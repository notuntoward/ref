# HTML Reader Plugin
From: [GitHub - nuthrash/obsidian-htm...](https://github.com/nuthrash/obsidian-html-plugin)

Paste an html file into and obsidian vault, and this plugin will display it.

**Installed**  I use it all the time to read stored SingleFile web pages from Zotero.

# YTranscript Plugin
From: [obsidian-yt-transcript](https://github.com/lstrzepek/obsidian-yt-transcript)

Puts up a configurable, timestamped transcript.  You can drag this into your notes.  It's good.

- type-in popup for YT URL, or gets it from selected URL text
- can copy ALL into your note
- a click on the timestamp and it pops up a new browser tab at that time (**duplicate browser tabs are annoying**)
- [attempts at combining](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/takeing-video-notes-via-media-extend-and-obsidian-yt-transcript/74926/2) it with [[2024-04-03#Media Extended plugin]]
- [tips/feature request for opening a media-extended side pane](https://github.com/lstrzepek/obsidian-yt-transcript/issues/52#issue-2392909989) instead of a new browser tab
	- just replaceÂ `&t=`Â withÂ `#t=`Â in the timestamped links

**Installed**, it's not bad
# Reclipped Original Plugin
From: [GitHub - tech-reclipped/ReClip...](https://github.com/tech-reclipped/ReClipped-Obsidian-Official)

The companion obsidian plugin to the [reclipped browser extension](https://reclipped.com/) that I thought was the best of breed for browser extensions, maybe last year.   On Browser, you download whole transcript, past screenshots, etc.  and this can all be synced to a single obsidian folder in markdown.  You can paste that into your lit note (or append, I think there's and obsidian plugin for that too).

- Using it would be a little like using SingleFile as an html editor
- except that the plugin's Obsidian `Sync you data now` command only copies your annotations; any edits you do in obsidian aren't synced back.
- Can paste in screenshots either on the web page or later in the obsidian note
- Will show you the transcript, But I don't see a way to download the whole thing
- Chunks of transcripts can be "highlighted," causing them to "sync" down to Obsidian when you run the command
- When you open synced obsidian note, an obsidian video side pane opens, and responds when you click on timestamps

- You can paste chunks of the notes into any note, and the pane will response to the timestamps there, but you have to have the pane already opened and to the right video
	- Seems to open the panel based on you clicking on the note it makes and syncs -- not the note you have pasted it to.  Annoying b/c I don't like that "all notes of the same type in the same folder" organization
	- not as good as [[2024-04-03#Media Extended plugin]] because the only way the right side pane opens is if you open the synced note, not any other note.
	- [x] would the right panel open if I embedded the notes in the lit note?
		- Nope.  The timestamp buttons are clickable but it doesn't change the panel

# YouTube Video Summarizer Plugin
From: [GitHub - mbramani/obsidian-yt-...](https://github.com/mbramani/obsidian-yt-video-summarizer)

- similar to [[#YouTube Summarizer Plugin]] but based on Google Gemini, and is newer
- gets transcripts, but doesn't seem to show you them, ever.
- You can specify a prompt which I later used to force a transcription, almost.
- See [[#YouTube Video Summarizer Plugin Test]] below
- It's not terrible, but I still worry about its summarization missing or misinterpreting.
- I made a [[Dailies/2025-03-27.md#Transcribe Then Summarize Prompt |Transcribe Then Summarize Prompt]] that transcribed and summarized, and it looks like it worked quite well on l [on this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx0J7dIlL7c) when using Gemini 1.5.  But the transcript part cut off at about 7 minutes, warning about token limits.
- ? Gemini is free; I wonder how much the equivalent would cost on OpenAI (this won't allow it)
- I had to use chrome for this, not Brave
	- Need to put timestamps etc. in to "summary notes", otherwise you get an unreadably huge amount of timestamps in the "highlights"
	- Need to log in to see this, but on the youtube page in Brave the plugin wouldn't detect that I was logged in
		- said I need to enable 3rd party cookies 
		- I did this and then nothing worked (so I went back to disabling them)
	- But it works fine in Chrome (maybe I have cookies enabled there?  I never checked).

**Installed**: see if I use it
# Transcription Plugin
From: [obsidian-transcription...](https://github.com/djmango/obsidian-transcription)

A transcription-from-file plugin.  So I guess you could download a youtube video?  Maybe good for lecture, zoom, or meeting transcription?

**Think about it**
# YouTube Summarizer Plugin
From [GitHub - ozdemir08/youtube-vid...](https://github.com/ozdemir08/youtube-video-summarizer)

- Uses OpenAI ChatGPT3.5 to summarize a video.  I don't see a transcript option, though
- I dunno, interesting?
- Didn't work.  Had an error popup
# You Tube Summarizer Plugin Appendix
## Transcribe Then Summarize Prompt
This quite well [on this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx0J7dIlL7c) when using Gemini 1.5, but the transcript part cut off at about 7 minutes, with the message:
  
  [The transcript continues for a considerable length. To avoid exceeding token limits, the rest is omitted here.  You would continue to process it in the same manner demonstrated above.]

**The Prompt**

```
You are a specialized assistant for creating accurate, timestamped transcriptiosn for from subtitles. The subtitles have been automatically generated by YouTube and may contain transcription errors, especially with technical terms, software names, and specialized vocabulary.  The timestamps must be retained in the note as clickable timestamps.

## Task

Merge or split the text beteen the timestamps in such a way that logics sements start with a single timestamp.  You don't have to create timestamps but you will need to delete some.  Ideally, timestamps in your output will start at the first word of a speaker 's"sentence" with no timestamps until the end of a speaker's "paragraph", unless the speaker is interrupted.  

If there is an interrruption, start timestamping the next speaker's speech in the same way.

## Handling Transcription Errors

- Correct obvious transcription errors based on context and your domain knowledge
- Pay special attention to technical terms, software names, programming languages, and IDE plugins which are frequently misrecognized
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most likely one based on the video's context
- but you must be very careful maintain the transcript to be as accurate (vs. actual words said) as possible.  Don't summarize in the transcription section.

## Output Structure


## Timestamped transcript
An accurate as possible transcript here, with timestamps selected or deleted as described above.  The timestamps should be clickable markdown lnks that open the youtube video at the time of the original timestamp.  This format is  commonly called  a"YouTube timestamp link".  DO NOT produce links like this:
[00:10:44] 

instead, produce links like this:

[[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx0J7dIlL7c&t=144s)

where the leading part of the URL is derived from the video's URL, using google;s algorithm.

#### Are These Trump Voters Getting What They Voted For? (with Mark Leibovich) | The Focus Group Podcast

![Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/aA0a3YjcVxQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

ðŸ‘¤ [The Bulwark](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG4Hp1KbGw4e02N7FpPXDgQ)  ðŸ”— [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA0a3YjcVxQ)
##### Summary
The podcast episode features Sarah Longwell and Mark Leibovich discussing Donald Trump's first 100 days in office after being elected again, focusing on how voters, particularly those who switched from Biden to Trump, are reacting. The conversation covers Trump's approval ratings, the perceived lack of direction from the Democratic party, and the impact of Trump's communication style. They analyze voter reactions to Trump's speeches, the normalization of Trump's behavior, and the potential negative consequences of his policies, such as tariffs, on the economy.
##### Key points
- Voters are split regarding Trump's first 100 days. Some are hopeful and appreciate the action, while others are concerned about the economy and the speed of changes.
- Many voters are more focused on their negative perceptions of the Democratic party than on the substance of Trump's policies.
- Voters who switched from Biden to Trump are starting to express concerns about the fast pace of changes and potential negative impacts on the economy.
- Tariffs are a significant concern for voters, especially regarding their potential impact on the automotive sector and consumer prices.
- The Democratic party is perceived as lacking strong leadership and effective messaging.
- Trump's communication style, although unconventional, has created a parasocial relationship with his voters, filling a void left by the Biden administration's more reserved approach.
- Trump's economic policies may have adverse personal consequences to real people.
##### Technical terms
- **[[LIFO (Last In, First Out)]]**: A method of inventory valuation where the last items added to the inventory are the first ones to be sold or used. In the context of the podcast, it is used as a metaphor for the voters who most recently joined the Trump camp, suggesting they are the most likely to swing back.
- **[[Parasocial relationship]]**: A one-sided interpersonal relationship in which one party invests time, energy, and emotion while the other party is unaware of their existence. In the context of the podcast, it describes the kind of relationship Trump has with his voters due to his media presence.

##### Conclusion
The initial reactions to Trump's return to office are mixed, with some voters enthusiastic about the changes and others expressing concerns about the economy and the speed of policy implementation. The Democratic party needs to find new leaders and improve their communication strategy to effectively challenge Trump. The long-term impact of Trump's policies, particularly tariffs, remains to be seen and could significantly influence voter sentiment.
