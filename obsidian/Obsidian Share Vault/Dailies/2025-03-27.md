# HTML Reader Plugin
From: [GitHub - nuthrash/obsidian-htm...](https://github.com/nuthrash/obsidian-html-plugin)

**Installed**  I use it all the time to read stored SingleFile web pages from Zotero.

# YTranscript Plugin
From: [obsidian-yt-transcript](https://github.com/lstrzepek/obsidian-yt-transcript)

Puts up a configurable, timestamped transcript.  You can drag this into your notes.  It's good.

- type-in popup for YT URL, or gets it from selected URL text
- can copy ALL into your note
- a click on the timestamp and it pops up a new browser tab at that time (duplicate browser tabs are annoying)
- [attempts at combining](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/takeing-video-notes-via-media-extend-and-obsidian-yt-transcript/74926/2) it with [[2024-04-03#Media Extended plugin]]

**Installed**, it's not bad
# Transcription Plugin
From: [obsidian-transcription...](https://github.com/djmango/obsidian-transcription)

A transcription-from-file plugin.  So I guess you could download a youtube video?  Maybe good for lecture, zoom, or meeting transcription?

**Think about it**
# YouTube Summarizer Plugin
From [GitHub - ozdemir08/youtube-vid...](https://github.com/ozdemir08/youtube-video-summarizer)

- Uses OpenAI ChatGPT3.5 to summarize a video.  I don't see a transcript option, though
- I dunno, interesting?
- Didn't work.  Had an error popup

**Uninstalled**

- You can specify a prompt
- I dunno, interesting?
- See [[#YouTube Video Summarizer Plugin Test]] below
- It's not terrible, but I still worry about it missing or misinterpreting.

**Installed**: see if I use it
## YouTube Video Summarizer Plugin Test

ðŸ‘¤ [The Bulwark](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG4Hp1KbGw4e02N7FpPXDgQ)  ðŸ”— [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA0a3YjcVxQ)
#### Summary
The podcast episode features Sarah Longwell and Mark Leibovich discussing Donald Trump's first 100 days in office after being elected again, focusing on how voters, particularly those who switched from Biden to Trump, are reacting. The conversation covers Trump's approval ratings, the perceived lack of direction from the Democratic party, and the impact of Trump's communication style. They analyze voter reactions to Trump's speeches, the normalization of Trump's behavior, and the potential negative consequences of his policies, such as tariffs, on the economy.
#### Key points
- Voters are split regarding Trump's first 100 days. Some are hopeful and appreciate the action, while others are concerned about the economy and the speed of changes.
- Many voters are more focused on their negative perceptions of the Democratic party than on the substance of Trump's policies.
- Voters who switched from Biden to Trump are starting to express concerns about the fast pace of changes and potential negative impacts on the economy.
- Tariffs are a significant concern for voters, especially regarding their potential impact on the automotive sector and consumer prices.
- The Democratic party is perceived as lacking strong leadership and effective messaging.
- Trump's communication style, although unconventional, has created a parasocial relationship with his voters, filling a void left by the Biden administration's more reserved approach.
- Trump's economic policies may have adverse personal consequences to real people.
#### Technical terms
- **[[LIFO (Last In, First Out)]]**: A method of inventory valuation where the last items added to the inventory are the first ones to be sold or used. In the context of the podcast, it is used as a metaphor for the voters who most recently joined the Trump camp, suggesting they are the most likely to swing back.
- **[[Parasocial relationship]]**: A one-sided interpersonal relationship in which one party invests time, energy, and emotion while the other party is unaware of their existence. In the context of the podcast, it describes the kind of relationship Trump has with his voters due to his media presence.

#### Conclusion
The initial reactions to Trump's return to office are mixed, with some voters enthusiastic about the changes and others expressing concerns about the economy and the speed of policy implementation. The Democratic party needs to find new leaders and improve their communication strategy to effectively challenge Trump. The long-term impact of Trump's policies, particularly tariffs, remains to be seen and could significantly influence voter sentiment.
