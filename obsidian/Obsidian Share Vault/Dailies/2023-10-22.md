# Vault Changelog plugin
- [GitHub - badrbouslikhin/obsidian-vault-changelog: Plugin for Obsidian to maintain a changelog of recently edited files in your vault.](https://github.com/badrbouslikhin/obsidian-vault-changelog)
- problem, you have to give an absolute path to the changelog.md file.  Doesn't work between Windows and MacOS
- My addition to a feature request: [[Feature Request] Mobile Path Support - Absolute paths · Issue #17 · badrbouslikhin/obsidian-vault-changelog · GitHub](https://github.com/badrbouslikhin/obsidian-vault-changelog/issues/17#issuecomment-1774237873)
# Show File Path plugin
- [GitHub - ravimashru/obsidian-show-file-path: Obsidian plugin to show the file path of the current file in the status bar](https://github.com/ravimashru/obsidian-show-file-path)
- **Pretty nice!**  I like that clicking on the status bar gives the copies the absolute path, *if you have it configured to show the base filename*.
