# University Research / MSFT Meeting w/ JonD (7/9/24)
## My points
### AEMO
- Results for hyperparam tuning
- next steps
- James Donn: next 2-4 weeks until Athena/AEMO data sprint
### University Research
- Main thing is Mukunda is not doing the job: passive, not consulting, letting things happen, but insisting on being in control anyway.
- tell Mukunda about our agreement w/ prob forecast, contextual opt.
- need info on funding
- need to define what that is vs. MSFT stuff
### MSFT
- get both of us involved in MSFT stuff now
	- there will be substantial adjustment required e.g. TypeScript
	- can't let data engineering handle this, else get a poor MLops environment
	- not just forecasting
	- this will involve research?
- If they want to do automl, they need to test it with non-experts
	- idea is to not use expertise
	- see how that goes immediately
## TODO
- [ ] Scott: set up Mukunda meeting
- [ ] Jon: consider whether to take part in MSFT strategy
- [ ] Scott: look into doing my own optimization -- Jon will help me set it up
- [x] Scott: [Ask Thomas Tsui about a new laptop](https://growingenergylabs.slack.com/archives/D07BQQ91N4B/p1720566700980129).
