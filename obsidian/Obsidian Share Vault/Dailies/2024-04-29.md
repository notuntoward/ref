# Note Toolbar plugin
From [here](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar)

A toolbar that shows up based on metadata content (I think), note type, or note folder.  Can add special purpose links, buttons, queries, etc.  Interesting examples [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-iiVfuLTX0).  Probably fun to play with but I don't have an immediate need.  Maybe if I used obsidian on a tablet or phone, this would be useful enough for the complication.

**Think about it...***
