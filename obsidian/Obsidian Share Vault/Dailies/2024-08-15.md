## Presentation Notes
- Overall
	- 5 markets recently increased reserves to maintain reliability
	- PNW had record peak demand last summer
	- says deeper analysis of factors affecting reliability, instead of simple, broad reserve capacity
	- new demand may cause
		- delayed retirement
		- more peaking capacity
		- market changes e.g. in ERCOT
	- PJM has made a hard turn to address reliability
	- "SPP" increased reserve rqts from 13% to 15%
		- says green generation benefits the most
	- CAISO
		- 15% --> 17% reserve margin increase
		- no impact to net zero goals (96.5% by 2040)
		- expect offshore wind to help w/ emission goals, nukes decline gradually
		- net load growth flat until 2029
		- some retained peaking
		- less "hybrid" activity; "retail" increase helps
		- he says they're somewhat overdoing reserve capacity
	- ERCOT
		- reserve around 31-32% "long term" estimate
		- moderate scarcity this summer, even though new peak demand records
		- operating reserves provided hour-to-hour
		- more support for "scarcity pricing" over time
		- results
			- a pivot to gas generation
			- higher build/retention of coal, combined cycle, peaking gen
			- ! reduced solar and storage
			- 10-15 GW additions by 2030 (I think it was)
	- NYISO
		- net zero goals dominate NYISO
		- offshore wind, balance similar to CAISO
		- in future years, expect green-vs-green competition: some curtailment
			- could limit progress to 100% zero emissions w/o gas --> hydrogen, etc.
		- great peak retention
		- reduced combined cycle cap.
		- BUT: offshore wind delayed, due to rebid
	- Nationally
		- increase in storage, driven by PJM
		- more coal retained in MISO and ERCOT, for reserves
		- greater aggregate peaking gen displacing combined cycle build
		- battery "about the same" by 2040
		- continued boost for solar and wind generation, "as a function of reserve providing capability?
- PJM capacity market (Kristen Larsen, of 3TIER)
	- their forecast for PJM capacity market prices: biggish increase
		- 14 to 17% capacity increase
		- near term shortfall
		- forecast largish increase in capacity market prices: 
			- I think $300 --> $350, or something like that
		- some argument of demand curve evolution that I didn't understand, she muffed the animation, it seems
	- capacity price forecast: ~ $200 --> $300 by 2029
		- even bigger capacity price increases later
	- generation
		- will benefit gas peakers and battery
		- coal, legacy peaking retained
		- adding a lot of stand-alone storage, gas peaking
		- some solar/wind increase
	- combined cycled gas plants get much larger margin (profit margin, I think), varies on project, though
		- underlying cost of gas is why varies.  e.g. Hanging Rock plant has way cheaper gas, higher profits
		- Hanging Rocks also has high capacity factor (10% higher)
	- wind and solar
		- Virginia and Ohio 
		- solar: better than 12% equity return
		- wind: exceeds 12% return
		- but neither as profitable as gas combined cycle plants
		- but higher prices in states w/ high renewable goals, much better return, so an "excellent" PJM investment
		  ![[2024-08-15-20240815094348321.webp]]
	- overall
		- big benefits to storage and peaking gen
		- expect much investment flow into renewable energy
- They also sell wind and nodal pricing forecasts (I think)
- Q & A
	- how make renewable progress if no dispatchable RES progress?
		- 4 hr batteries help a great deal when get to late hour peak demand but only supplement gas
		- in 'critical hour,' need longer duration storage to handle, so need conventional gen until long dur. storage is implemented
	- when will storage mkt decline, esp. ERCOT?
		- ERCOT favors more dispatchable gen
		- says battery storage mkt is approaching saturation in ERCOT
		- don't see it declining
		- if ORDC creates sustainable return something will infuence
		- says they're really forecasting a quarter-over-quarter decline in storage mkt, but not a "decrease"?  I didn't understand this point
	- battery storage "looks pretty good in PJM"
		- location matters in PJM: higher profits if more expensive gas (profits for storage?)
	- if have high RES requirements, don't see high build of combined cycle as economic, I think Kristin said.
	- assumption of 10 years ago, that combined cycle was bridge to future is under question (outside of ERCOT)
		- higher PJM capacity will help existing combined cycle, but some qualifier on that, I guess.
	- "ELCC" whatever that is, changes stuff
	- Impact on user energy prices, esp. residential?
		- PJM: downward pressure on wholesale prices b/c of more capacity rqts (I think he said)
		- so could make retail prices higher?
		- says last several years prices have been low, though
		- so I think he's saying the prices are a "correction"
	- PJM prices over next 20 years?
		- increased reserve margin with "lower ELCC values"
		- this drives higher capacity prices in 20 years
# Forecasting Group Meeting
- AS utilization forecast is UP TO date, NOT A good place for me
	- Amir says just use prob AS realizations
- says lots of work done on deterministic, so use that
- Hirsh wants more quantiles
- current quantiles are too conservative, maybe need Q99 (I think he said?), low is P0.1
- pretty much all features are used by all the models
- Conclusions
	- start by making quantiles from existing RT deterministic forecast
		- ask Hirsh what he wants for that
	- use existing AS realizations
	- [ ] if want correlated RT price and AS realizations, will have to make new AS realizations
