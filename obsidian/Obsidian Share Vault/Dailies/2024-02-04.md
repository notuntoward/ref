# Images getting deleted problem

When I paste a [Bing Copilot response](https://sl.bing.net/eVYLr6kTKBU) into a page, the images are copied, and then eventually, they are removed, and the links say the image cannot be found.  Three suspects are:
- Consistent attachments and links
- [[Dailies/2025-03-02.md#Image Converter Plugin |Image Converter Plugin]] (although probably not, since I already had it turned off)
- Local Images plus (most likely, since problem was still there w/ consistent attachments and links turned off)
When I turned all of these off, the problem went away
- [ ] Figure out this bug, and report it
