# Tags and Properties Plugins
Related to [[My Tabs and Properties Obsidian Plugin]]
## Better Properties Plugin
From: [GitHub - unxok/obsidian-better...](https://github.com/unxok/obsidian-better-properties)
- last update was 5 months ago
- Guy says it's beta release, still doing integration testing
- uses undocumented obsidian api feats, so seems likely to break
- Has some stuff I don't care about, probably

**Not installed** 
## Page Properties Plugin
From: [GitHub - necauqua/obsidian-pag...](https://github.com/necauqua/obsidian-page-properties)
- last update 2 years old
- [similar to logseq](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/page-properties), if you want them
- 44/100 popularity

**Not installed**
## Metadata Menu Plugin
From: [Metadata Menu](https://mdelobelle.github.io/metadatamenu/)
- looks long in the tooth
- seems like it's made to create all kinds of properties, maybe before the new obsidian properties interface was created

**Not Installed**
## Tags Overview Plugin
From: [GitHub - christianwannerstedt/...](https://github.com/christianwannerstedt/obsidian-tags-overview)

- This is an improvement over [[2024-04-08#Tags View Core Plugin]], but it's not as pretty.
	- [prettying advice](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-like-the-pane-views-that-obs-3Nl.sT19QpG2JwRi6xnhRA#1)
- Adds a tag viewing sidebar that has simple [[Evernote to Obsidian and Zotero|Evernote-like]] boolean tag searching, 
	- Better tag searching than [[#Tags Overview Plugin]]
	- with file links, last modified dates, sorting, etc.  
- Kinda nice.  
- No command for it, activate with the tag icon on the ribbon.  
- Could use it as a prototype for building a pane view for the [[My Tabs and Properties Obsidian Plugin]]
- doesn't get `/` tag hierarchy, unlike [[2024-04-08#Tags View Core Plugin]]
# Breadcrumbs Plugin
From: [breadcrumbs/V4.md at master Â· ...](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/blob/master/V4.md)

Some kind of relationship graph, but it doesn't do much in 7/25.  There's a BRAT-ready prototype V4, but who has time?

**Uninstalled**
