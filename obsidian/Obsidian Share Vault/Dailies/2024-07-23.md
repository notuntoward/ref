# Amir Stopgap Forecast Work Meeting & Followup w/ JonD Meeting

Mukunda says cancel AEMO, find something that produces a result by the end of this year -- optimization not an option.

## My Goals for Stopgap

- Do optimization anyway
- Don't increase GHGs (ERCOT)
- Probabilistic
- Avoid routine stuff
- Learn some MLOPS tools, get on the cloud?
- Learn new techniques
- Finish concept drift idea
- Something I work on with JonD
## Tolerable things

- CAISO: has the ingredients, not ERCOT
- Something GraphNN about LMP?
- CCI but real stochastic opt. (would require getting JonD to modernize considerably)
- Something Chariot?

## My points
- Looking for something JonD and I can work on together
- What is "transcript" or "transit"? TransGrid (a company we're developing a optimization)
- Chariot?  JonD says there's something there
	- Block trading?
		- average price over a certain # of hours
	- take "market clearing" into account?
		- Byron is working on that
			- JonD: yes, it is a supply/demand curve problem
				- can get anonymized curves from ERCOT after 90 days
				- Byron's building a market model clearing
				- Jon wants the whole price curve
				- could do bi-level optimization ^s1j9
					- [ ] like [SaezGallego17invOptFrcstElecMktPrice](SaezGallego17invOptFrcstElecMktPrice.md)?
					- [ ] like [[Zhao24uncertInformBilevRESsched]]? 
				- we don't operate real sites, so we don't have info about how much this could save
				- but we know there are supply curves
				- especially ancillary service markets, since one battery could supply whole market e.g. ERCOT
				- [ ] I should follow up w/ Byron
				- [ ] two important decisions
					- currently only do market floor, self scheduling, price taker.  Want to get out of that.  
					- would like to offer curve 
					1. DA when lock in ancillary services tomorrow
					2. Gen DA decisions, how handle RT mkt
						- [ ] CAISO better than ERCOT for this b/c ERCOT batteries mostly go to DA; CAISO more RT market
							- [ ] could be RL (tried in ERCOT, but didn't work)
							- [ ] Markov decision problem
							- [ ] more complicated forecasts: forecasts conditional on
								- [ ] curve is price/Watts curve, conditional on what price you assume
		- we're assuming our bid will get cleared
	- Amin has done good work on formulating problem closer to what Chariot wants, I could work on that
	- connection to Ai4Opt, in some what that's a high priority I didn't understand
		- JonD
			- from Ai4Opt:he thinks that's what Mukunda wants
			- Mukunda doesn't know enough to understand the value
- CAISO
	- My points
		- LBMP modeling?
		- graphNN?
		- Peak finding?
		- "portfolio,"  Atlas?
	- Amir: they're doing price forecasting
		- 1st version is out already
		- I could work on next steps
		- Need help 
		- 4 or 5 forecasting streams by (sept?)
			- has a plan for this already, Stephen has a model
			- one doesn't have data
			- I'd do next version
- CCI
	- prob forecasts
	- modernize it to ERCOT standards?
- Battery model?
- Amir:
	- Chariot: new formulation 
		- but Amir's is already good
		- it's very stressful, Chariot attacks
	- CCI
		- I could lead modernizing
		- JonD sez:
			- CCI MLOPS modernization
				- Cloud people must consider cost first
				- in past, haven't used lambda b/c of cost
				- resi and CCI now: chron job avoids AWS managed services, just use (other?) services
			- Says we s/ do algorithm stuff, load forecast is most imp
			- There is a chance to do fancy stoch opt in CCI
				- he was hired to do that
				- what he did was that KNN thing, which got good. results on demand charges, wanted demand response insterad
				- sat on shelf for 4 years
	- But he can make room on CAISO too
		- it's not mature
	- ERCOT
		- Says ERCOT is so mature, I may not be able to do much
		- JonD:
			- build stoch model w/ forecasts of all different services
			- this idea could also work on CAISO
			- he's OK w/ either CAISO or ERCOT
			- wants to do more looking into ERCOT and CAISO to see where ripe problems are, what we could do
- JonD: way out there idea
	- use PV for ancillary services w/o batteries
	- if *very* confident in forecast and energy cheap
	- then curtail PV
		- then sell reg up
		- or contingency response
	- would need to simulate to compare w/ const of solar
	- would need to consider future market prices, forecasts, 10 years from now
		- QCELLS does buy 30 year price forecasts form consultants
	- a DOE project was done on this, he could look it up
	- CA 100% RES studies: no storage really needed until about 85% RES
