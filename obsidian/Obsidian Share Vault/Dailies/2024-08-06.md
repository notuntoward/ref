# Consistent Attachments and Links Plugin
From:[GitHub - dy-sh/obsidian-consis...](https://github.com/dy-sh/obsidian-consistent-attachments-and-links)

Updates links when you move around pages or attachments.  Recommended by the Orange British guy. I've been using it for months, and it works great, as far as I can tell.

# Backlink Cache Plugin
From: [GitHub - mnaoumov/obsidian-bac...](https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-backlink-cache)

Speeds up backlinks page for large vaults (only.  According to its own docs).  Recommended by the [[#Consistent Attachments and Links Plugin|Consistent Attachments and Links Plugin]]. 

**Installed**.  I didn't notice slowness on the backlinks page, but maybe this does help the [[#Consistent Attachments and Links Plugin|Consistent Attachments and Links Plugin]].
