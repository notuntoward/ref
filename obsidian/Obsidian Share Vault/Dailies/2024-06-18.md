# Webinar: Gridmatic ERCOT Storage Report

A webinar about [Gridmatic's 2023 Annual Storage Report](https://www.gridmatic.com/insights/).  CAISO was mentioned but it was almost all about ERCOT.

- ERCOT: batteries w/ high failure to provide power also had higher profits (worst was best!).  I guess this is a market failure.
- Pareto Boundary
	- they operate on the "AI-optimized frontier" of risk (failure to provide) vs reward
	- found (across all batteries) opportunity for better pareto tradeoff with better optimization
	- says its important to know where you are on pareto
- says their opt would have 32% "uplift" (increase in profit) across fleet
- market risk is "held by owner".  They just sell optimization to them.
- @ forecasting if ECRS will result in being called upon to provide power, I guess.  **A new kind of forecast**
- doesn't know how FTP of thermal plants compares to batteries
	- NREL (?) study: perfect resource would provide 2X "something" than thermals
	- batteries are near perfect (I think he said 97% availability somewhere, not sure about what mean FTP was)
- reduced ancillary service revenues last year, I think.  Probably b/c more energy arbitrage participants.
- $54M "storage fund" somehow "collateralizes" batteries
- ERCOT warned that it might impose stricter FTP penalties
	- not clear if they are doing that already, as ERCOT apparently doesn't say
- rebound peak events?  
	- question: could mass battery charging create another peak event ("rebound peak event")
	- guy says scarcity pricing would make disincentives for battery operators to do this.
- LDES: will it ever "pencil?"
	- guy says short duration batteries now are handling it now OK.
	- doesn't know future
- **Slides and Report will be shared**
	- report already on their website
# Emacs Text Editor Plugin
From: [GitHub - Klojer/obsidian-emacs...](https://github.com/Klojer/obsidian-emacs-text-editor)

- [Commands it provides](https://github.com/Klojer/obsidian-emacs-text-editor?tab=readme-ov-file#example-of-keybindings-configuration), with suggested keybindings
- See [[#My Emacs Hotkeys|My Emacs Hotkeys]] from this plugin (and then some)
- Is afflicted by Obsidian's [[Obsidian Sync#Windows/MacOS hotkey conflict and overwrite|Windows/MacOS hotkey conflict and overwrite]]
- [Issues known to creator](https://github.com/Klojer/obsidian-emacs-text-editor?tab=readme-ov-file#known-issues)
	- Move to beginning of line command (Ctrl + a) conflicts with select all action. Solution: Use emacs/End + Shift.
		- Not a problem.  In emacs I didn't use a "select all"
	- Conflicts with existing hotkeys. Solution: use additional plugin for custom bindings, for example [[2024-07-06#Leader Hotkeys Plugin|Leader Hotkeys Plugin]].
		- An annoyance
		- that plugin adds a prefix map, so you can avoid conflicts by putting certain emacs or standard keys behind a prefix.
		- Leader hotkeys plugin author uses `ctrl + b`
	- Absent support of "kill-ring". Solution: use plugin [paste-from-history](https://github.com/Karakaz/obsidian-paste-from-history) with `Alt + y` keybinding
		- Not a problem?
		- [ ] would the [Kill and Yank plugin](<2024-06-16.md#Kill and Yank plugin>) do this too?  Answer: **No**
	- Absent support of scroll-up/scroll-down commands. [Solution is not found](https://github.com/Klojer/obsidian-emacs-text-editor/issues/1)
		- An annoyance
		- yeah, that's too bad.  Workarounds ^m0z2
			- arrow keys
			- pgup/pgdwn keys
			- emacs style centering still works, which I use a lot (`ctr + l`, in emacs)
	- Absent support of holding shortcuts. [Solution is not found](https://github.com/Klojer/obsidian-emacs-text-editor/issues/2)
		- An annoyance: keyboard repeat doesn't work, have to hit a key for each character
		- plugin author [recommends](https://github.com/Klojer/obsidian-emacs-text-editor/issues/2#issuecomment-1986849718) trying [this plugin](https://github.com/dsedivec/obsidian-emacs) but I don't see it on the obsidian community plugins setting list
		- Works on MacOS, but not on Windows.  My bug: [Keyboard repeat works on MacOS...](https://github.com/Klojer/obsidian-emacs-text-editor/issues/6) ^byra
- My Issues
	- `Ctrl + y` (Emacs text editor yank), when pasting a URL, doesn't activate [[2024-04-17#Auto Link Title plugin|Auto Link Title plugin]], like default Obsidian paste
		- so link title not gotten
		- but maybe that's OK:  ^xnm7
			- even on Emacs, yank, bound to `C-y`, just pastes the URL
			- I use `org-cliplink`, separately bound to `C-c y` to specifically to paste get the title
	- [x] My `ctrl + g` feature request: [ctrl + g doesn't cancel search...](https://github.com/Klojer/obsidian-emacs-text-editor/issues/7): not implemented, not in Obsidian API.
	- [set mark command doesn't work on MacOS ...](https://github.com/Klojer/obsidian-emacs-text-editor/issues/8) ^f8gl
	- [x] kill word doesn't put word in kill ring: [kill word doesn't put word in ...](https://github.com/Klojer/obsidian-emacs-text-editor/issues/9): implemented
	- Emacs text editor recenter doesn't work inside of a table
	- ctrl + e in a cell doesn't go to end of cell, but to end of table
	- keyboard auto repeat: [[#^byra|Works on MacOS, but not on Windows]]

Table below started from [Example of keybindings configuration](https://github.com/Klojer/obsidian-emacs-text-editor#example-of-keybindings-configuration).  I didn't take all the recommendations.
