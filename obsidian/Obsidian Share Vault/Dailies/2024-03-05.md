# Zotero / Obsidian / Pandoc: Lit Review and Export

A couple very good articles on this.  Zotero by itself has too many limits in the Notes section, while plain zotero links in obsidian are neither friction free, nor exportable to a .docx or whatever.  These articles go a long way to using zotero and obsidian together, more conveniently and comprehensively.  

I should fully read them and give this setup a shot:

- [ ] [An Updated Academic Workflow: Zotero & Obsidian | by Alexandra Phelan | Medium](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd) ^3f568b
	- [ ] modify my template to be similar to hers
	- [ ] use @ in note title.  Does her template do this?  I tried it and it didn't, although there were error messages when I imported a zotero item. (Guo23Curious*)
		- [ ] [[2024-03-26#ZotLit plugin]] has some support for [pandoc @key links](https://zotlit.aidenlx.top/getting-started/basic-usage/citation-insertion) ^1dbd58
	- [ ] import tags?
	- [ ] import relateds? (this already works in zotTemp_LSQ_SDO*)
	- [ ] collapse related callout
	- [ ] store complete full metadata, like in her template?  Why not?  Nice to have but info duplication.
	- [ ] **more important**: include links to any file, for example, the html in this [zotero entry](zotero://select/library/items/PV43V6D4)
		- works in done in zotTemp-LSQ-SDO-html, but...
		- [ ] Don't show "Local" when there's no html or pdf, etc.
	- [ ] close zotero notes callout, or just remove callout, so zotero note its easily merged w/ what I add  later in obsidian.
	- [ ] images copied by me into zotero note not copied to Obsidian.  Example: [Amid explosive demand, America is running out of power](zotero://select/library/items/UCFF33VA)
	- Phelan's template preserves your notes: [[2024-03-09#Zotero --> Obsidian note merging (not overwrite)|Zotero --> Obsidian note merging (not overwrite)]]
	- Here template might be fine, but I'm not sure I like that here @cites don't go anywhere when you click on them.  This allows simpler citation export for publication, but doesn't result in clickable links 
		- [ ] (does it?)
		- but maybe that's OK, b/c you can still link across literature notes, and make obsidian topic notes which interlink.  It's just at the publishing phase where you make the @pandoc links, (right?)

- [ ] [Literature Reviews using Zotero & Obsidian | by Alexandra Phelan | Medium](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/literature-reviews-using-zotero-obsidian-66eba1565d78)
- [ ] [Working with Related Items â€“ Mastering Zotero](https://pressbooks.library.yorku.ca/masteringzotero/chapter/working-with-related-items/) 
	- Better in zotero or in obsidian?  Both? Zotero once and quickly; add to relateds once in Obsidian note?)
- [ ] [Pandoc plugin](https://github.com/OliverBalfour/obsidian-pandoc) 
	- may do export to a powerpoint 
	- currently fails I have an image on the obsidian page
