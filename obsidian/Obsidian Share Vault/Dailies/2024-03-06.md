# Pandoc Export Plugin
- An obsidian plugin that exports you page to all kinds of stuff, and is used in [[2024-03-05#Zotero / Obsidian / Pandoc Lit Review and Export|Zotero Integration Page Export]]
- Pandoc Export Plugin kinda works but fails if the page has an image.
- HOWEVER, I can export to pdf using built-in obsidian command: **Export to PDF** and this can be exported to Word and/or powerpoint (I think)
## Ingredients
- choco installed pandoc
- choco installed texlive
	- this required installing all latex packages (see howto.org)
- whatever other stuff was in that article
## What it can export to
- Word (works well)
- Latex
- PowerPoint
- pdf (some problems with that (see howto.org))
# Another headline, just to see how powerpoint export works
- bullet 1
- bullet 2
- looks like bullets are bullets in Powerpoint
- text is text
- H1 is slide title, one slide per title
- BUT ppt export fails if there is an image on the page.  Error message disappears before I can read it carefully
- Word export finishes, but image is binary junk
