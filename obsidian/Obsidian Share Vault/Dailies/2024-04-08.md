# Strange New Worlds plugin
From [here](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-strange-new-worlds)

Little numbers show how many times a note, or a block in a note, has been linked to (backlink count).  Better yet, shows the backlink count for each link in the note.  Numbers are pretty inobtrusive.
- Tons of options, hover editor, if you like, can drag to side pane.  
- Can activate either by mouse hover only by a hover *only* with a 'modifier' key (ctrl, or alt?).  
- Makes it easy to see if a link is a link to a note vs. a raw Zotero link, or a URL, which is nice
- [ ] one setting is supposed to display selected properties somewhere, but I don't see it (I tried displaying the property `type`)
- Little numbers don't show up on a headline that's linked to from somewhere else in the same note as that headline:  
	- [x] Somebody else reported this bug: [Heading references are not cou...](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-strange-new-worlds/issues/142)- 
- [x] does this interfere w/ cursor movement i.e. does it make a popup when the cursor goes near a note?  Answer: **NO**
- [x] do I want hovers *only* w/ the modifier key? Answer: **Yes**.  It's better to intentionally press ctrl and hover.

# Tag Wrangler plugin
From [here](https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler)

Nice utility to rename tags, etc.

- my [feature request to add tag to all open tabs](https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler/issues/130)
- Last update 2 yrs ago, although license update 2 mos. ago (From 7/25)
- Rename/search/toggle tags from inside of tags view.
- I think it's enhancing the [[#Tags View Core Plugin]], which I like

**Installed**

# Multi Properties plugin
From [here](https://github.com/fez-github/obsidian-multi-properties)

Can add multiple properties to multiple files in the file explorer.  But not to open tabs.

- my [Feature Request: add property to all open tabs](https://github.com/fez-github/obsidian-multi-properties/issues/17)
	- guy originally rejected it w/o comment
- I submitted a PR to work on all notes in a tab group
- no response on my PR yet (July 2025), and I've already changed my mind on implementation details

**Disabled.**
# Tags View Core Plugin
From: [Tags View core plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/tags): 

Nice hierarchical tags view, searchable list, finds all notes w/ tag, similar to [[#Properties View Core Plugin]] but specifically w/ tags

**Installed** 
# Properties View Core Plugin
From: [Properties View core plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/properties)

Fantastic for single notes
