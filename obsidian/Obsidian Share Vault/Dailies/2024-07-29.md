# Jon Mtng
- Jon's goals for forecasting stuff
	- Markov forecast of some kind, discretized power
	- some kind of fan, which is different that the above
		- seems like either could just be derived for a huge number of scenarios.
	- corr between how much AS being utilized and energy price (I think)
		- AS uncertainty may be more important than price uncertertainty.
