I'll test transclusion here:
![[2023-09-20#^4caff6]]
It works!  It's not editable, which maybe is OK.  Can make it editable using one of the plugins below

* how to transclude
	* bookmark a chunk of text but `^blockname` at the end of the paragraph or whatever (blockname is something you can pick, or let obsidian bookmarks do it, or some other way I don't recall)
	* in the place where you want to transclude enter `![page#^blockname]`
