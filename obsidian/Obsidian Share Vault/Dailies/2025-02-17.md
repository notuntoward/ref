# Numerals Plugin
From: [GitHub - gtg922r/obsidian-numerals: An obsidian plugin which turns a math code block into a full featured calculator](https://github.com/gtg922r/obsidian-numerals)

Calc with variables, unit conversion and math-tex.
- Lots of options
- seems like you must to go source mode in order to edit it.  
- Cool, and maybe I'd use it?

**Calculator**
```math
# Costs
lemons = $3
sugar = $2
firewater = $3
water = $0 # unless Evian
total = lemons + sugar + firewater + water

# Revenue
sales = 30
price = $0.50
revenue = sales * price

# Profit
profit = revenue - total
```

**math-tex**
```math-tex
sqrt(75/3) + det([[-1, 2], [3, 1]]) - sin(pi / 4)^2
1/2*(9.81 m/s^2) * (2s)^2 + 3 m/s*2s in ft
$1,000/day * 48 hrs
```

**Installed**

# Structured AI queries

A youtube video showed how to constrain openAI using pydantic somehow.  It's a way to do RAG, build knowledge graphs, and so on.  Of course it looks simple.

- video: [Pydantic is all you need: Jason Liu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj-wSRJwrrc)
- python package: [GitHub - instructor-ai/instructor: structured outputs for llms](https://github.com/instructor-ai/instructor)
- [ ] ! put this in my AI outline sometime?
