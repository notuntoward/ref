# Replace Block Embed Plugin Idea
- I asked for it in Logseq and [got it ~2 years later](https://github.com/vipzhicheng/logseq-plugin-move-block/issues/8#event-12850048807)
- [ ] Ask for it in Obsidian
# DiagramGPT

Website(s) where you type in a flow description plain language or other ways, and it will spit out a diagram of it.

- [DiagramGPT](https://diagram-gpt.fraserxu.dev/): 
	- output is mermaid, 
	- need OpenAI key
	- I didn't try
- [DiagramGPT â€“ Eraser](https://www.eraser.io/diagramgpt): 
	- worked reasonably well on my fake problem
	- Reviewer really likes it, if you make it do the boring part: [DiagramGPT - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=DiagramGPT&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:fd15cd8d,vid:Tz84qAH_7bM,st:0)
	- no OpenAI key needed, 
	- draws right away, but is low res
	- need to sign up (free?) to export
	-
