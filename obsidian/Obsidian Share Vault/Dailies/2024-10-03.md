# Enhanced Image Plugin
From: [GitHub - situ2001/obsidian-enh...](https://github.com/situ2001/obsidian-enhanced-image)

Adds a bunch of right-click context menu functions to images, like copy, save as, show in finder, ... I

**Installed**

# Diagram Zoom Drag Plugin
From: [GitHub - gitcpy/diagram-zoom-d...](https://github.com/gitcpy/diagram-zoom-drag)

# Diagram Pop Plugin
From: [GitHub - gitcpy/obsidian-diagr...](https://github.com/gitcpy/obsidian-diagram-pop)

Can zoom, etc. on many diagram types e.g. a Mermaid. Looks less intrusive than [[#Diagram Zoom Drag Plugin|Diagram Zoom Drag Plugin]], but is only installable with brat (10/4/24), isn't yet in the obsidian plugin library.

**Monitor this and try it when it's in the obsidian plugin library**
