# Smart Typography Plugin
From: [GitHub - mgmeyers/obsidian-sma...](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-smart-typography)

Automatically expands hyphens to em/en hyphens; makes arrows; curly parens; ellipses, inequalities etc. A large number of automatic conversions.
- Nice but not totally configurable.
- Last commit (on 10/24): 2 years ago

**Uninstalled**, as the [[#Enhanced Symbols Prettifier Plugin|Enhanced Symbols Prettifier Plugin]] is much newer and better.

# Enhanced Symbols Prettifier Plugin
From: [GitHub - noam-sc/obsidian-enha...](https://github.com/noam-sc/obsidian-enhanced-symbols-prettifier)

An expander like [[#Smart Typography Plugin|Smart Typography Plugin]] but has far more expansions that I want, and doesn't have some I don't want e.g. curly parens.  

- Last commit (on 10/24): 1 month ago
- seems totally configurable
- has configurable hotkeys, although I don't see where they are, at the moment
- can expand words e.g. w/o → without
- backspace to undo the expansion
- learns word-use frequency, can do auto subs for these, somehow
- importable/exportable configuration ⇒ a community

**Installed.**
