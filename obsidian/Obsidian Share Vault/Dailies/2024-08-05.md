# Research Group Meeting
JonD, Mukunda

- Agenda: [2024-08-05 Meeting notes](https://growingenergylabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ARG/pages/9523396932/2024-08-05+Meeting+notes)
- Discussed [draft plans](https://growingenergylabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ARG/pages/9494659948/Draft+Project+Plan+Stochastic+Optimization+for+Real+Time+Energy+Market+Bidding#%5CuD83D%5CuDD17-Reference-materials)
- Conclusion
	- switch off CAISO unless you find the data soon
	- verify no significant ERCOT overlap
		- Muk's biggest concern is that we're starting behind ERCOT, and they might make a prob forecast before we do, or one that's better.
	- OR make another plan
- [x] [Call Nace](https://growingenergylabs.slack.com/archives/C07CWG2TZSM/p1722901437918519), check the forecasting roadmap, are they planning more prob forecasts soon?
- [x] [Ask Forrest](https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model) to ask NRG about the data
