# List callouts plugin
From [here](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-list-callouts/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+preview)

Put one of many symbols after the list bullet e.g. `~` and the list line gets one of many colors, and optionally, symbols.  This would be quite nice but for me
- but, it only works in live preview mode, not in preview ([my bug comment](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-list-callouts/issues/7#issuecomment-2020796604)). 
- probably not a bug, but a conflict with another plugin
	- b/c of my [[2023-12-02#org-mode like bullets w/ css snippets|org-mode like bullets w/ css snippets]]?
		- I turned off my fancy bullet symbols CSS but this didn't improve things, so probably not that.
- [ ] My Feature Request: [Feature Request: command to remove callout character · Issue #71 · mgmeyers/obsidian-list-callouts · GitHub](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-list-callouts/issues/71)

**Installed**: I use it a lot.
# Make.md plugin
From: [here](https://github.com/Make-md/makemd)
- not obvious how to use many of the functions
- adds some editing popups
- adds a `\` after you make a headline
- crashed all of obsidian on something I tried
- one nice thing could be that it allows you to edit embeds with the "flow" editor, if I could figure out how to run that.
  
Has the annoying effect of VSCODE hinting, with irrelevant popups (which a lot of coders like, and maybe they are the people who like this plugin).  Because of the crash, and the lack of clarity about how to use it, I **uninstalled**.

# ZotLit plugin
From [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-zotlit/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file), [Documentation](https://zotlit.aidenlx.top/)

Does bulk export of literature notes, unlike [[2024-03-09#Zotero Integration Plugin Working out the details|Zotero Integration Plugin]], but is "under active development" features subject to change, maybe not fully developed.
``
Seems to be a simpler, more direct interface to Zotero.  I'm not sure if it has advantages over the [[2024-03-09#Zotero Integration Plugin Working out the details|Zotero Integration plugin]], and I may never know.  I tried to install it on Windows, and it told me I had to install some squlite3 thing.  I clicked the "auto-install" button and it hung forever ([my bug report](https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-zotlit/issues/327#issue-2208773046)).  There was a manual sqlite3 install option, and it didn't work either.  For now, we'll see how Zotero Integration goes.  If it's bad, I might try ZotLit again, but for now, ZotLit is **uninstalled**.

- has [[2024-03-05#^1dbd58|support for @key notation]] used by by [[2024-03-05#^3f568b|Phelan's template]]
- also [[2024-02-25#ZotLit plugin]]

# Better embeds

How to make them match better?
- they're rendered in view mode, not live preview so fonts are a lot smaller and different: jarring for most of the time I'm using obsidian
- indents don't match embedee's hierarchy indent (bullets, mainly)
- that blue line to the left is annoying too
### Embed Test
- stuff above
	- an indent to see if it matches (nope)
![[#Make.md plugin|Make.md plugin]]
stuff below

# Dynamic Embed plugin
From [here](https://github.com/dabravin/obsidian-dynamic-embed)

Treats embed like content of embedee, so should be less intrusive.  Can import CSS, templates, notes.  *However*, it seems that you can <u>only embed whole files</u> -- not what I want, so I didn't try it.

# Obsidian Citation Zotero plugin
From [here](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin)

An Obsidian plugin that parses the .bib file exported by Zotero's [[Obsidian/Zotero 6 to 7.md#Better BibTex |Better BibTex]] and hen makes an Obsidian literature note of its own form to a single, pre-specified Obsidian vault folder.  Its [templates are very static](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api?tab=readme-ov-file), and apparently don't have a way to do conditional, or loops, like you can with the [[2024-03-09#Zotero Integration Plugin]], and its [[2024-03-09#Zotero Integration Template]]. 

This doesn't seem better than the [[2024-03-09#Zotero Integration Plugin]],

***Note installed.***  Doesn't seem as good as the alternatives.

# CircuitJS plugin
From [here](https://github.com/StevenGann/obsidian-circuitjs?tab=readme-ov-file)

Can embed the code and graphics of the free [circuitsjs1](https://github.com/sharpie7/circuitjs1) (?) circuit simulator.  Seems a little like spice?  Animations are [quite cool](https://falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html) e.g. look at the op amp high filter chirp and impulse response with (apparently) animated current jiggling on the wires.  If I ever want to do that, I should *give it a try*.
