# VDER 20 year simulation Meeting
- My points
	- VDER probably won't make sense in 20 years: what if sim says that?
	- assumptions need to be made
		- peak flatness
		- how long the program lost
		- assumptions about algorithm accuracy
	- lots of work to discuss the assumptions
	- Gabe: just use top 10
		- means we'll always succeed in getting ICAP
		- so just a constant loss of DRV
		- instead: assume get N peaks where the N peaks are within distinguishability
	- Assmption question
		- relationship between number of algorithm disharged days and actual peak days
		- just say apriori know how many true peaks must be discharged in year to get ICAP
			- guaranteed ICAP
			- variable DRV loss
			- Gabe: fixed number
			- Scott: this needs to respond to long term (20 year) load flatness
				- need function of true load flatnes vs. # peaks needed to catch ICAP peak
					- either train this function on past algorithm resultsor relate # of or assume 
				- OR say it's apriori known number of NYISO daily forecast load peaks
			- OR (JASIME) pick discharge based on daily peak quantile in year.  This is the same as picking the number of yearly peaks
				- this is same as saying a constant # of peaks per year, no matter what the load shape is
		- OR (Scott) say simulated VDER peak of year algorithm fires if forecasted peak is within X stds of acausally known NYISO daily forecast peaks
	- if do this, why do we need MPC?
		- Billy says wouldn't know LIMBP summer time revenues
		- Emma says it's not driven by arbitrage w/ LMBP in summer, since ICAP and DRV is so big
