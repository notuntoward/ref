# Annotator Plugin
From: [GitHub - elias-sundqvist/obsid...](https://github.com/elias-sundqvist/obsidian-annotator)

A pdf and epub reader/annotator.  It probably worked, but I needed the epub reader but there was no way to disable it's pdf reading function, which conflicted with [[2024-03-16#PDF++ plugin]].

**Uninstalled**

# ePub Reader Plugin
From: [GitHub - caronchen/obsidian-ep...](https://github.com/caronchen/obsidian-epub-plugin)

An ePub-only reader, which has decent navigation and seems well-maintained (7/25).

**Windows Default ePub Reader**
- @ To have a Windows default OS epub reader, I installed calibre
	- `winget install --id=calibre.calibre -e`
	- In windows, I associated .epubs with calibre reader instead of the full program, because in the full program, it always wanted to look into its own library folder
- I also tried Icecream Ebook Reader
	- `winget install --id=IcecreamApps.IcecreamEbookReader -e`
	- but it didn't a have a viewer option like calibre, and it also then wanted to open up its own private library folder

**ePub Reader Plugin and Calibre installed**
