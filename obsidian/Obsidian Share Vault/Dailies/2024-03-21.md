# Hide \%\% Comments 

**Why do this?:** For hiding the persistent directives which prevent Zotero integration plugin from overwriting stuff I've added to my Obsidian literature note.  The best solution is: [[#Hide live-preview comment unless cursor is on it|Hide live-preview comment unless cursor is on it]]

## Hide live-preview comment unless cursor is on it
From: [my question on Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/hide-comment-in-live-preview-but-not-in-source-mode/79078) 

**Perfect**: Works in live preview only, leaving it always hidden in viewing mode (as before), and always displaying it in source mode (as before).  In live preview, the comment is hidden (but a blank line remains) unless the cursor is on the line.

.is-live-preview .cm-line:not(.cm-active):has(.cm-comment-start, .cm-comment-end) * {
    visibility: hidden;
}

I put it in Obsidian Share Vault/.obsidian/snippets/hide_comments_in_preview.css

<u>Example</u>: See the comment on the line immediately below by clicking on it:
%% a comment %%
There is a comment on the line immediately above.

## Hide all comments everywhere
From: [CSS Hide comments in Live Preview - Help - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/css-hide-comments-in-live-preview/47108)

Hides all of comment, including the line,  in all modes.  Problem is that it also hides comments in Source Mode, so you can never see what's there, if you want to.  (visible in emacs, I suppose, though)
``
.cm-line:not(.cm-active) .cm-comment
    { display: none; }
## Hide just \%\%
From: [Hide comment markdown? : r/ObsidianMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/18ivxlh/comment/ke1pfia/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Displays the content of the comment but not the \%\% delimiters.  Is less distracting, but still uses up vertical space.  Also, this does still hide \%\% in source view, which I don't want.

.cm-line:not(.cm-active) .cm-comment.cm-comment-start,
.cm-line:not(.cm-active) .cm-comment.cm-comment-end {
  display: none;
}
## Hide comments everywhere but don't delete comment line
Almost what I want, but it hides it in both preview *and* source mode. Uses opacity instead of visibility  directive.  Not sure what the difference is, as neither delete the line.  Seems like display:none deletes the line.

.cm-line:not(.cm-active) .cm-comment {
  opacity: 0; /* Adjust opacity value as desired (0 for fully transparent)
}

# Manually convert lit note cites to Word cites & bib
From: [How I research and write in Obsidian - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEYp0BJL7MU)

Could build bibliography via pandoc and csl, etc. (as in [[2024-03-05#Zotero / Obsidian / Pandoc Lit Review and Export|here]]) but this simpler approach just uses Zotero.

**Start with an Obsidian draft page containing links to (Obsidian page) lit notes:**

1. Export draft to Word [using pandoc](https://youtu.be/zEYp0BJL7MU?t=1216)
2. [overwrite your lit note link w/ Zotero link](https://youtu.be/zEYp0BJL7MU?t=1244)
3. [Add a bibliography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEYp0BJL7MU&t=1251s) to end of word doc
