# Tag Folders Plugin
From: [GitHub - vrtmrz/obsidian-tagfo...](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-tagfolder)

With the right config, this looks like it could be link zotero's collections -- in fact it might be possible to run literature note tagging with zotero, and let it overwrite obsidian tags (for lit notes, at least, but do I really want that)
