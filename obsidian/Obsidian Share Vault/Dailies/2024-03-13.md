# View meeting on AEMO bid stack
- retailers not allowed to bid: they're willing to pay $15k (ceiling price)
- only scheduled loads can set price
	- large scale battery
	- pumped hydro\
- scheduled loads are settled first
	- can't schedule too low or won't get server
- retailers: they're always served, their price is highest
- small batteries are price takers, like other loads
- large scale batteries: >= 30 MW
- what that paper talked about: not what NEM is doing now
- [ ] View to see if paper is describing what AEMO reform will look like
- current method described in ==Guide to Scheduled loads== pdf from AEMO
- large scale battery 
	- energy bids
	- battery DUIDs for same battery:  HPRL1 (load), HPRG1 (gen)
	- when they want to 
	- price bands are opposite sides for gen and loads (bigger/smaller/  different order?  what did I mean?)
	- they set their prices to gen when they want to; charge when they want to
	- [ ] View thinks NEM won't pick both charge and discharge.  She'll look at what the rules are to prevent this
	- [ ] she'll make a numerical example
- %VRE question
	- table that has totaldemand: predispatchis
	- semischeduled generation: all VRE
	- also report separately as wind and solar (SS means semi-scheduled)
	- small scale solar is semi-scheduled: farms >= 30 MW
	- so.. doesn't include rooftop solar
	- is a forecast since is in TOTAL DEMAND
	- [ ] she'll look for the tables used in that %VRE table.
	- realtime measurements
		- dispatchIS she sent link on slack
		- is 5 mins
		- same lag as 
		- price arrives at 10:01, covers price from 10:00-10:05
		- dispatch table descriptions says that it's based on bids, but they can rebid 5 mins before: is that an explanation for TOTALDEMAND non-divergence (price does diverge)
- [ ] interconnectors: she'll look to see if it's changed much lately
	- look for something that might indicate price spikes
	- she guesses that no big changes in interconnectors since 2010
