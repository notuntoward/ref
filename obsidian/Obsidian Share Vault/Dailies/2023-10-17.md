# Latex / MathJax
From: [Comprehensive Overview | LaTeX Mathjax Equation In Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA0z7oR7OWc)

- **inline** equations are LaTex surrounded by single $ symbols
- **centered** equations start on a separate line, and are surrounded by double $ 

**Test**:  Here is an inline $\pi$ symbol. 

But $\pi$ is really small until you change the Obsidian style CSS.  I think you can do it locally, per page, but I just changed it globally.  I followed these [CSS snippets](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets#:~:text=To%20add%20a%20CSS%20snippet,file%20that%20contains%20your%20snippet.) instructions, adding a snippet file here: 

> Obsidian Share Vault/.obsidian/snippets/bigEquations.css  

with the contents (from the video above):
```
.MJX-TEX {
  font-size: 125%;
} 
```

Here's a centered equation:
$$S (\omega)=\frac{\alpha g^2}{\omega^5} \,
e ^{[-0.74\bigl\{\frac{\omega U_\omega 19.5}{g}\bigr\}^{-4}]}$$

# Options for YouTube Video Notes

**My Conclusion**: [Timestamp Notes Plugin](https://github.com/juliang22/ObsidianTimestampNotes) looks best to me, but I could consider [Readwise Official Plugin](https://github.com/readwiseio/obsidian-readwise) too, if I want [yet another subscription](https://readwise.io/pricing).  Also maybe Media Extended plugin, if it is ever updated.

From: [Taking notes from YouTube videos in Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjWq4ck2-0o)
## Manual Embed
- Right click on video
- "copy embed code" 
- paste into obsidian:
  
<iframe width="341" height="192" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qjWq4ck2-0o" title="Taking notes from YouTube videos in Obsidian" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- need to resize height and width (in source mode) to get reasonable size
- is also ugly in preview edit mode (looks OK in view mode)

## Media Extended plugin (old 2023 review)

I tried it again in 2024, and liked it.  See [[2024-04-03#Media Extended plugin]]

- command "Media Extended: Open Media from Link"
- paste embed code from clipboard, as above, into the popup, will paste video into Obsidian
- Media Extended : get timestamp from player command gets the timestamp, as you're playing the video (she made a hotkey for it)
- paste it in, and then type in your description
- but clicking on timestamp link sends you to the web browser
- can't stop play while you write your note
- Brian Jenks liked this in 2022: [best obsidian video timestamp annotator - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=best+obsidian+video+timestamp+annotator&oq=best+obsidian+video+timestamp+annotator&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCTEyNjc5ajBqNKgCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:58a3402c,vid:GQXVWtNkeZw,st:0), but says it has some annoyances.
- But it seems to be dead code: [last update was in 2021](https://github.com/aidenlx/media-extended) (in 10/23)

## Timestamp Notes Plugin
From [here](https://github.com/juliang22/ObsidianTimestampNotes)
Functional but I hated the big buttons that weren't organizable, outlineable.  In the end, I wanted simple timestamp links, like others.  I eventually disabled it, and gave its hotkeys to [[#Media Extended Plugin|Media Extended Plugin]].
- Timestamp Notes: Open video player
- paste link (normal link, I think) in bullet that's made for you
- this makes an embed for you in a **sidepane**, not inline (better, more vertical space for notes)
- use the command for timestamping for this plugin
- giant buttons are clickable, bring you to sidepane
	- My comment on a [feature request to make them smaller and inline](https://github.com/juliang22/ObsidianTimestampNotes/issues/21#issuecomment-2033197529).
- can pause video in sidepane, so this is easy to do
- setup details: [[#Setup for Timestamp Notes Plugin|Setup for Timestamp Notes Plugin]]
- My test is below: [[#Video How To Use Obsidian Properties, DataView, & ONE HUGE PROBLEM TO AVOID|Video How To Use Obsidian Properties, DataView, & ONE HUGE PROBLEM TO AVOID]]
- below, when I tried to use it, I found out that you need to have the note with the youtube stamps on it in preview mode in order for the hotkeys to work.
- My Example Test:  [[2023-08-08#Timestamp Notes plugin good for YouTube notes]]
- My feature request: [Feature request: don't take over youtube links, add a youtube link to media viewer](https://github.com/PKM-er/media-extended/issues/325)

**Disabled, maybe eventually uninstalled** 

## TEST SPOT 3

## YiNote
- a chrome browser extension, similar to the one I installed on Brave, that works fine.
- video pauses when you start typing a note (nice)
- **annoying sponsor popup!**
- she likes the auto screenshots (annotatable) that it makes when you type
- Export to markdown, paste into obsidian
- don't see all the nice screenshots, etc. in Obsidian
- clicking in obsidian sends you to the browser

## Readwise Reader
- click on yellow R icon in browser (this is a Chrome extension)
- will print a transcription and highlight it as it video plays (nice for language learning, I think)
- syncs to obsidian via *Readwise Official* plugin
- looks pretty good, with metadata on top
- see text highlights, but *don't get a timestamp* to where the highlight was
- she likes it anyway, and also how they are adding AI, etc. to it.
	- ghostreader: it makes automatic text from your highlights, the usual chatGPT trick
	- generates thought provoking questions for you to answer while watching video
	- etc.
	- she says it's like the [shortform](https://www.shortform.com/) book summarizer but for videos
- ## Her Conclusion
	- she uses Timestamped Notes if she has a big screen
	- Readwise might be what she uses the most in the future, for now, it's handiest when she's on a tablet (or phone, I suppose), uses it like a "read it later" thing, but better b/c fo text.
# Setup for Timestamp Notes Plugin

See GitHub: [Timestamp Notes Plugin](https://github.com/juliang22/ObsidianTimestampNotes) 
## TEST SPOT 1

## Hotkeys

I set up the hotkeys as recommended in the plugin page shown in Obsidian:

- Opening the video player (my default is cmd-shift-y)
- Opening a local video (my default is cmd-shift-l)
	- you really have to paste the video URL into a note
	- highlight it
	- Ctrl + shift + y
- Inserting timestamps (my default is cmd-y)
- Playing/pausing video (my default is ctrl-space)
- Seeking forward/back (my default is ctrl-arrows)

#### My Hotkeys (Windows)

Except for the mystery open sample modal command, which I left blank for now (my bug report
#### Default Hotkeys 
(what they were after plugin install)

## Other options to set up
- Colors of the url, url text, timestamp button, and timestamp text
- Title that is pasted when 'Open Video Player' hotkey is used
- How far you want to seek forward/back

 [How To Use Obsidian: Properties, DataView, & ONE HUGE PROBLEM TO AVOID - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFUvhtT2Nsc)
 ```

A bumbling non-coder introduction to the [[2024-04-11#Dataview plugin]].  The kicker is that property names can't have spaces in them.

```timestamp 
 04:33
 ```
- Update to Obsidian means you don't need a template with headlines

```timestamp 
 05:52
 ```
 - command: show file properties
 - show properties sidebar (blank if no properties for this note)
 - add properties there and/or property values
 - I think you have to a "show properties" setting enabled to see it on the note as the same time as you edit them in the sidebar
 - If have dates, type full date for "date", or just the year if you want it as a string
 - tag values are already available, so less risk of making extra tags due to misspellings
 - somehow define that a property is numeric (I missed it when he explained how)

```timestamp 
 12:58
 ```
- **Now, you'll want to use the dataview plugin**

```timestamp 
 14:53
 ```
- Dataview plugin settings

```timestamp 
 15:12
 ```
- Making a new dataview page, for, I guess, all the files in a folder
```timestamp 
 16:32
 ```
- he then cargo cults in a dataview statement from somewhere he does not explain, and then modifies it
- example is just searching for all notes in folder that have the tag 'action'
```timestamp 
 23:16
 ```
**The PROBLEM**: Property names *can't have spaces between them*.
