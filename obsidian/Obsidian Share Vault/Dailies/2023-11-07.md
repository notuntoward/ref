# Work
- Commented on [MC data in Athena Reorg](https://growingenergylabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DE/pages/8746696805/MC+data+in+Athena+Reorg)
- 90 day review inputs
- AEMO price forecast: FINALLY was able to plot error vs. horizon, and it looks like you'd expect, w/ error increasing w/ horizon, and RMSE much bigger than MAE.  MAE starts out in the neighborhood of 2X the mean average price -- this is near horizon 0, and is similar to what I got on EPEX over *all* horizons out to 24 hrs, I think.  Part of this is due to the 5 min sample periods, rather than the smoother 15 min (?) EPEX, but still the AEMO forecasts are pretty bad.
# Life
- [my suggestion](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-open-pdf/issues/5) for opening an external pdf reader from zotero (to the plugin author who has already made this easier with his plugin)
