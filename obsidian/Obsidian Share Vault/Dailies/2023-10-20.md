# Undoing/Redoing jumps within the same page
- built-in navigation between pages is useful, but when I'm jumping to locations within the same page, and want to move forward and backward between those jumps
- [Navigate back (Alt-Left) to previous cursor position on the same page for intra-page links](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/navigate-back-alt-left-to-previous-cursor-position-on-the-same-page-for-intra-page-links/20647/7?u=scotto) : somebody mentioned the plugin below
- [[Dailies/2025-03-12.md#Navigate Cursor History Plugin |Navigate Cursor History Plugin]] might have worked in 2023
	- In 2025, try [[Dailies/2025-03-12.md#Cursor History Plugin |Cursor History Plugin]] 
# Editing toolbar plugin
- looks good: [obsidian-editing-toolbar](https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-editing-toolbar/commits/master)
- I'd still like modal highlighting, though.  
- [x] submit modal highlighting feature request, like I did for [highlightr]() and [color-text](https://github.com/erincayaz/obsidian-colored-text/issues/28).  **Done**:  here's the request: [Modal highlighting, as in most pdf readers · Issue #118 · PKM-er/obsidian-editing-toolbar · GitHub](https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-editing-toolbar/issues/118)
- [ ] bug report.  highlighter color doesn't change if I change it in the palette.
- [ ] **clear formatting seems to be modal**

# Custom sort plugin
- [obsidian-custom-sort: Take full control over the order and sorting of folders and notes in File Explorer in Obsidian](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort?source=post_page-----4a7576b2db84--------------------------------)
- I could have a "latest first" sort order in a lit folder, like I do in Evernote.
- [must create a "sortspec" note](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort?source=post_page-----4a7576b2db84--------------------------------#basic-scenario-1-set-the-custom-sorting-order-for-a-specific-folder) w/ special yaml for individual control
- [ ] not so bad if it's in a giant lit folder; annoying in a project folder.  Delete plugin if this isn't OK.
- [ ] [advanced-README.md](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/blob/master/docs/advanced-README.md)
# Colored Tags plugin
- [GitHub - pfrankov/obsidian-colored-tags: Colorizes tags in different colors.](https://github.com/pfrankov/obsidian-colored-tags?source=post_page-----4a7576b2db84--------------------------------)
- Interesting autocoloring of tags, w/ special treatment for heirarchy.  If I have a hundred tags, does this help anything?
