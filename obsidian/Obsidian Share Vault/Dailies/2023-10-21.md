# File Hider plugin
See: [GitHub - Oliver-Akins/file-hider: A plugin for https://obsidian.md that allows hiding specific files and folders from the file explorer.](https://github.com/Oliver-Akins/file-hider)
- I'd use this for hiding attachments folders
- But it doesn't look like you can tell it "hide all attachments folders"
- have to do it manually
- My feature request: [Any chance to programmatically hide files? · Issue #37 · Oliver-Akins/file-hider · GitHub](https://github.com/Oliver-Akins/file-hider/issues/37#issue-1955756570)
