# Zotero <--> Obsidian Links

Zotero _Better Notes Add-on has a way of two-way syncing Obsidian Markdown_ notes.  It worked but then it broke (Oct. 2023).  Would be nice to get 2-way syncing working, but in the meantime, here are simpler ways.

## Plugins
### Zotero Plugins


#### MarkDB-Connect Plugin
- see [[Zotero 6 to 7#MarkDB-Connect Zotero Plugin|MarkDB-Connect]]
#### Better Notes Plugin
- [zotero-better-notes](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-better-notes)
- 2-way markdown sync?  Fragile?  Lots of other stuff I'm not sure I care about
### Obsidian Plugin
* **Roll your own**: [Linking from Obsidian to Zotero](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/linking-from-obsidian-to-zotero/29128)
* [[2024-02-25#Zotero Integration Plugin|Zotero Integration Plugin]]: seemed best to me in 2023
* [obsidian-citation-plugin](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin): was this was broken in 2023
* [[2024-03-06#Zotero Link|Zotero Link]] is the easiest
