# Zotero <--> Obsidian Links
- See [[lit/refwrangle/Zotero to Obsidian to RAG.md#Zotero <--> Obsidian Links |Zotero <--> Obsidian Links]]


Zotero _Better Notes Add-on has a way of two-way syncing Obsidian Markdown_ notes.  It worked but then it broke (Oct. 2023).  Would be nice to get 2-way syncing working, but in the meantime, here are simpler ways.

## Plugins
### Zotero Plugins

#### PDF Download
From: [GitHub - syt2/zotero-scipdf: D...](https://github.com/syt2/zotero-scipdf)
Downloads hard to find pdfs, I think from scihub.  I don't know if this is working or not yet, but at least I'm not getting error popups all the time, like I was with a scihub downloader on Zotero6.

- Settings: I changed the schihub URL to https://sci-hub.se/

 **installed**
#### Zotero Preview
From [GitHub - dcartertod/zotero-plu...](https://github.com/dcartertod/zotero-plugins?tab=readme-ov-file)

Adds a preview of the bibliography item in the bibtex style of your choosing -- easy to copy and paste.  Don't forget to get the [Zotero 7 version](https://github.com/dcartertod/zotero-plugins/releases).

- Settings
	- Preview style: MLA 9
	- Position: Bottom
	 **installed**
#### MarkDB-Connect Plugin
- see [[Zotero 6 to 7#MarkDB-Connect Zotero Plugin|MarkDB-Connect]]
#### Better Notes Plugin
- [zotero-better-notes](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-better-notes)
- 2-way markdown sync?  Fragile?  Lots of other stuff I'm not sure I care about
#### Actions & Tags Plugin
From: [GitHub - windingwind/zotero-ac...](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-actions-tags)

Among other things, lets you run javascripts in zotero by just pasting them into this plugin.  Can be run by menu or by keyboard shortcut.  Many contributed scripts.

I'm using it to make a [[Zotero to Obsidian to RAG#Less tedious Zotero --> Obsidian Lit Note process]].
##### Javascript API (for Action & Tags plugin?)
Presumably, the javascript can use the [Zotero JavaScript API](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/client_coding/javascript_api), or at least maybe: the[ plugin author helpfully told me to read the Zotero code](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-actions-tags/issues/474#issuecomment-2715451204).

### Obsidian Plugins for Zotero Interface
### Obsidian Plugin
* **Roll your own**: [Linking from Obsidian to Zotero](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/linking-from-obsidian-to-zotero/29128)
* [[2024-02-25#Zotero Integration Plugin|Zotero Integration Plugin]]: seemed best to me in 2023
* [obsidian-citation-plugin](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin): was this was broken in 2023
* [[2024-03-06#Zotero Link|Zotero Link]] is the easiest
