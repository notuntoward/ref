# Video: How to REALLY BOOST note taking with SMART Obsidian Templates!
From [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_b1KrheJ4)
Good ideas for meeting note templates.  I'm using some of them already, but not all.
- Meetings template w/ more stuff than usual, some, maybe...
- Task plugin + Checklist plugin (puts TODOs in a sidepane)
- He uses tp.file.cursor().  I tried it again, and now it works in my daily note template.  Huh.
- I like the idea of categorizing TODOs e.g. for me, or for others (followup or "fup")
	- [ ] But how to prevent the intrusive Task plugin menu popup on every single TODO, *everywhere*?
	- I don't want it, e.g. for brainstorming during drafting
	- can it be document/folder/document class - specific
- [Multi-column markdown plugin](https://youtu.be/b2_b1KrheJ4?t=521)
	- save vertical space by making perfunctory, short info multicolumn.  Good idea. 
	- **However**, it's only multi-column in reading mode, I think.  That doesn't help.  I'm always in edit mode, where this would [still be displayed in single-column](https://youtu.be/b2_b1KrheJ4?t=609) (is "edit mode" both preview and source?)
# Video: # Obsidian Web Clipper (how I do it)
From [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQF7Dw0cVP8)
A crude way to do it, almost as good as Evernote `simplified article` clipper, which means not great but functional. Capture nowhere near as good as SingleFile browser extension, but doesn't have the editing-later problems it has (plain markdown is not a terrible option).

- Obsidian CEO's web clipper, a bookmarklet
- Shows how to edit it to change stored properties
	- [ ] which properties of a web page are available?
	- [ ] can it find author, date, etc on browser, like Evernote sometimes can, but Zotero mostly can't?
- dumps it into a folder of clippings
- images seem to be missed sometimes 
	- [ ] if at top of page?
	- sometimes stored but in the wrong place
	- are live links, so could use something like [[2023-10-23#Local Images Plus plugin]] to download them
- [ ] Is this better than the Markdownload browser extension, or other options?

# Smart Connections plugin
From [here](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections)

Note similarity and Q&A. Just the similarity finder would be great, 
- [ ] but can it parse pdfs?
- [ ] can it sync w/ new notes automatically, or do I have to run something to make it happen?

# Text Generator plugin
From [here](https://github.com/nhaouari/obsidian-textgenerator-plugin)

Q&A of your notes, is (maybe?) less locked into OpenAI than [[#Smart Connections plugin|Smart Connections plugin]], but pastes crap in your notes.  Do I like that?  Video Notes: [[Hofferber24noteTakingAEobsidian|The AI Note Taking Powerhouse]]

**Think about it, maybe sometime**
# Excalidraw plugin
From [here](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)

Drawing program w/ deep ties into Obsidian notes.  People use it to mindmap them.  Can also use AI to generate website mockup html: [[Hofferber24noteTakingAEobsidian|The AI Note Taking Powerhouse - Obsidian]]
**Installed on occasion** 
# Autocomplete plugin
From [here](https://github.com/Yeboster/autocomplete-obsidian)

Autocomplete words as you type, luckily no longer maintained.  I would hate this but [[Hofferber24noteTakingAEobsidian|this guy]] likes it
**Never install**
# Languagetool plugin
From [here](https://github.com/Clemens-E/obsidian-languagetool-plugin)

Online grammar and spellchecker interface, is in "maintenance mode".  I don't love these things, and anyway, there's probably something out there that's in an active state.  [[Hofferber24noteTakingAEobsidian|this guy]] likes, it, though.
**Never install**

# Matter plugin
From [here](https://github.com/getmatterapp/obsidian-matter?tab=readme-ov-file)

Another highlight grabber, this time with the [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/) app, says it's a better read-it-later.  It's browser based, so I suppose it works on desktops as well as phones.
**Don't install** 
# Dataview plugin

The SQL-like note querying database.  Very nice, although it sounds like a future built-in Obsidian [datacore](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore) may subsume dataview, but I'm not sure

# Booksidian plugin
From [here](https://github.com/MichaBrugger/booksidian_plugin)

Syncs something from [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/), a book recommender site, with discussion chats and stuff.  I signed up, but I don't know if I need this, as I already have too many books to read, and the recommender will add a bunch more.
**Think, but don't do anything, about it**
