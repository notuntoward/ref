# Task List Kanban Plugin
From: [GitHub - chrskerr/task-list-ka...](https://github.com/chrskerr/task-list-kanban)

Works on checklist TODO's, doesn't require (or allow?) you to use [[2024-07-06#Task List Plugin|Task List Plugin]]. Collects all the tasks from folders you specify and puts them in a Kanban.  tags right on the TODO in the notes can specify which Kanban, and which board within, a task should be placed; changes make on Kanban are synced back to original TODO.

## Bugs or Shortcomings
- Can't click on a TODO in the Kanban and be sent to the TODO in the source note
- Can't seemingly move a task back to its original card, once you've moved it to a new empty card

**Disabled**, see if it gets updated enough.
