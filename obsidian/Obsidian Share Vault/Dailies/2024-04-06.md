# Daily Notes Template Video

Following this video, [PART 2 - Daily Template](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txTRBNpaiSk&list=PLV3aPPnTIVj5_6uwyz2gWWO8lKWmFhEgM&index=2), I set up a daily notes template, installed [[#Periodic Notes plugin|Periodic Notes plugin]], and made a daily notes template, which I pointed to both tine the [[#Periodic Notes plugin|Periodic Notes plugin]], and in the Obsidian setting for a daily notes (necessary for the ribbon calendar icon to create the same kind of daily note as the calendar).  I left the core Daily Note plugin enabled so that this icon would work (against the advice of the video author).

- daily note breadcrumb is nice, 
	- but if go to future note, must run `Daily Note Template` after clicking on it, to fill in the empty note.
	- [**Solution**](https://youtu.be/-PYyO7y0aBs?t=534): make a Templater folder template, that runs `Daily Note Template.md`. This **works**.zo
- properties for dates, and `type` will make this more quarriable sometime.
# Calendar Plugin
From:[GitHub - liamcain/obsidian-cal...](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin)

Makes a little calendar in the sidebar that puts a dot where you have daily notes. Very simple but works.

- Most recent update was 2 years old in Nov. 2023
- Daily notes-only, which is good (that's what I use it for) but bad because it would be nice to display other notes updated on that day too, like the [[2024-11-03#Chronology Plugin|Chronology Plugin]]

**Installed** 
# Periodic Notes plugin
From [here](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes)

Creates a new daily note from the Calendar (calendar plugin), and add makes it handy to make summary weekly, monthly and yearly(?) notes.  So far, I'm only using dailies, but this was recommended in the [[#Daily Notes Template Video|Daily Notes Template Video]], so I installed it.  
- Seems like the only thing I get out of it is the "new note from calendar" part.
- That's nice, but I don't need this desperately
- Meanwhile, Obsidian is desperately sluggish.  I need to narrow down on plugins

**Uninstalled**: reinstall if I miss it
# Meeting Notes
## Meeting Notes Template Video

I watched [Meeting Notes Template in Obsidian. Let's build out a project framework together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXqoLmU13C4), and this is a good starter, but in addition I want
- automatic links starting from daily note
- not sure if I want meetings separated from projects
- collects TODOs, makes them queryable (I think this was in there)
	- Project page [where TODOs are collected](https://youtu.be/IXqoLmU13C4?t=1598)
		- [dataview statements](https://youtu.be/IXqoLmU13C4?t=2537) collecting done an undone TODOs
	- Meeting note template [where TODOs are made](https://youtu.be/IXqoLmU13C4?t=1816)
- [ ] # Get this working.  Seems useful.

## QuickAdd plugin
From [here](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd)

Can use this to create a meeting note and leave a link to it in your daily note.  Good video on this: [Using the Obsidian Quick Add Plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrQVQ37y6IU)
- [ ] # I need to create a meeting notes template. 
	- decent template in video above
	- The [[#Meeting Notes Template Video|Meeting Notes Template Video]] had a good starter

# Google Calendar plugin
From [here](https://github.com/YukiGasai/obsidian-google-calendar)

This plugin requires fussy setup, while the alternative -- [[2024-04-07#Custom Frames plugin]] -- does google calendar w/ no setup.  Does google keep as well so use that instead of this.

- with this plugin, must do [cloud API setup](https://yukigasai.github.io/obsidian-google-calendar/Setup)
- I decided I didn't want to mess with that for now

**Uninstall**
