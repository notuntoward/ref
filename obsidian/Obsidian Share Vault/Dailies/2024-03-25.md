# Remember Cursor Position Plugin
From: [GitHub - dy-sh/obsidian-remember-cursor-position: Obsidian plugin. Remember cursor position for each note](https://github.com/dy-sh/obsidian-remember-cursor-position)

Remembers cursor position!  Also remembers if the editor was in source, preview, or view mode.  The alternative was [obsidian-remember-file-state](https://github.com/ludovicchabant/obsidian-remember-file-state), which was updated 4 months ago, just like RCP.  But RCP has been around longer, has far more stars and downloads, and was written by the guy who wrote "consistent attachments," which has been a champ.

So I installed RCP, and **it works!**
