# Change Case plugin
From: [GitHub - dbrockman/obsidian-ch...](https://github.com/dbrockman/obsidian-change-case)

Has many separate case commands, so could have separate commands, rather than toggle, as in [[2024-03-09#Toggle Case Plugin|Toggle Case Plugin]].  However, it doesn't move a word forward after changing case, like Emacs does.
