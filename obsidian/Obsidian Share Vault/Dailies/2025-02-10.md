# Header Navigation Plugin
From: [GitHub - talwrii/obsidian-header-navigation: An obsidian plugin to navigate around and toggle folding on headers](https://github.com/talwrii/obsidian-header-navigation)

org-mode inspired heading folding and movement that's up-to-date (most recent commit was 2 mo. ago, as of 2/2025).  But the parts I'd use are redundant with aloready existing commands.

I've so far preferred to fold first and then navigate across folded stuff instead of navigating to wherever the next thing is, so the **Toggle header folding** command is useful, but the **Toggle fold on the current line** does the same on headers as well as lists (which I prefer)

## Commands for this plugin
- **Toggle header folding**
- Jump to next heading at the same level
- Jump back to heading
- Jump to parent heading
- Jump to the first child of current header
- Jump to previous heading at the same level
## Related, already-existing commands
- **Toggle fold on the current line**: does headers and list, mapped to `ctrl+enter`
- **Fold less**: nice, does both headers and lists, already mapped
- **Fold more**: nice, does both headers and lists, already mapped
- **Fold all headings and lists**: Nice, already ma
- Fold the list: list-specific, don't really need

**Disabled** Maybe someday this will remind me that I want to navigate by header?
