# Header Navigation Plugin
From: [GitHub - talwrii/obsidian-header-navigation: An obsidian plugin to navigate around and toggle folding on headers](https://github.com/talwrii/obsidian-header-navigation)

org-mode inspired heading folding and movement that's up-to-date (most recent commit was 2 mo. ago, as of 2/2025).  But the parts I'd use are redundant with aloready existing commands.

I've so far preferred to fold first and then navigate across folded stuff instead of navigating to wherever the next thing is, so the **Toggle header folding** command is useful, but the **Toggle fold on the current line** does the same on headers as well as lists (which I prefer)

From the author of [[#Plugin repl Plugin]].  Also see [[Dailies/2025-03-31.md#Gotoheading Plugin |Gotoheading Plugin]]

- My hierarchical move feature request: [hierarchical move commands (dw...](https://github.com/talwrii/obsidian-header-navigation/issues/5)
- also [[Arrow and Tab Key Mapping]]
## Commands for this plugin
- **Toggle header folding** (stock **toggle fold on current line** also does bullets)
- Jump to next heading at the same level
- Jump back to heading
- **Jump to parent heading**: I did *think* of using this in org-mode but this one not that useful, doesn't scroll cursor if jump off screen ([my comment](https://github.com/talwrii/obsidian-header-navigation/issues/4#issuecomment-2766746198))
- Jump to the first child of current header
- Jump to previous heading at the same level
## Related command already in Obsidian
- **Toggle fold on the current line**: does headers and list, mapped to `ctrl+enter`
- **Fold less**: nice, does both headers and lists, already mapped
- **Fold more**: nice, does both headers and lists, already mapped
- **Fold all headings and lists**: Nice, already mapped
- Fold the list: list-specific, don't really need.

**Disabled** Keep it around so I'll see if the author improves it
