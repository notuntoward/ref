# Open Editors Plugin
From: [GitHub - shows the opened groups and the tabs inside them. Allow to close groups or all tabs at once.](https://github.com/4Source/open-editors-obsidian-plugin)

What I'm looking for is a vscode "close editor group" function, sort of described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1atadhv/keybinds_to_manage_tab_group_layout_or_carrying/).  This is very β and doesn't have it anyway.  But I thought I'd ask...

- Feature request:  [[FEAT]: vscode "close editor group" for obsidian · Issue #6 · 4Source/open-editors-obsidian-plugin · GitHub](https://github.com/4Source/open-editors-obsidian-plugin/issues/6)

**Disabled** but installed so I'll notice changes

# Spacekeys Plugin
From: [GitHub - jlumpe/obsidian-spacekeys: Obsidian plugin to define hotkeys based on sequences of keypresses.](https://github.com/jlumpe/obsidian-spacekeys)

For doing spacemacs things, but for now, I only want to split windows `ctrl+x 2` and `ctrl+x 3`. Seemed like the most maintained plugin that can do this.  Maybe I'll eventually want to do something like my emacs hydra?

**Installed**  It's great.  Lot's of things I could add to this
