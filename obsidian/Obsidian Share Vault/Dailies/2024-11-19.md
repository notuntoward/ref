# Monitor Brightness Control with Surface Pro 11 connected to external dissplay 

When I'm in dual display, I can't change brightness on either the computer or the external monitor (Dell 3223QE). I found 2 solutions
## Monitorian Windows Store App
From: [GitHub - emoacht/Monitorian: A...](https://github.com/emoacht/Monitorian)

**This is the best method.** It worked the first time.

**Install**:
```
winget install Monitorian -s msstore
```

Then there will be an icon in the "Taskbar Notification Area":

Click it and there will be sliders for both the internal and external displays. Works perfectly!
## Display Settings Shortcut
From [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/on-my-surface-pro-11-how-do-i-rpthVGmtSn6XCYxDU_10YA#3)

You can change the internal display brightness with this, as well as a lot of things involving *both* monitors. But there's not slider for changing the *external* monitor; the [[#Monitorian Windows Store App|Monitorian Windows Store App]] is a better solution. But is good for other monitor settings.

**Install**:
1. Right-click on an empty area of your desktop.
2. In the context menu, select New > Shortcut.
3. In the "Type the location of the item" field, enter the following:

   ```
   ms-settings:display
   ```

1. Click Next.
2. Give your shortcut a name, such as "Display Settings", and click Finish.
# RCV LDL Roundtable Zoom Call

## Points
- [x] what if they don't know yet?
	- could email natalie, ask him to call back
	- add the notes
- [x] what does `Volunteer interest for direct candidate support?` button mean?
	- Kari will deal
- [x] leave message?
	- do, but put in notes
	- but do not click the left message box, under the could not reach button
- [x] does "call" mean just dialed?
	- literal dials: copy Luke's tab
- [x] how avoid double calling?
	- no mechanism to do this
	- would have to be a manual step, I don't think it will happen
- keep track of calls made by yourself
	- so can add to table
	- check Luke's tab to see how he modified his list
- Luke will forward my name/number to any LDLs he gets for me; I do the same for him
- [x] I was on the list D36; but those aren't my leads
	- can sign them up for whatever dist they way, email this district's captain
- [x] I should add my email and phone number next to my summary table
	- yup
