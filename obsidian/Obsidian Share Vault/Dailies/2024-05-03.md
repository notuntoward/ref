# Share PV Simulator project details w/ AIDT meeting

- Jackson, Jon D&L, Billy Hayes
- Jackson talking...
- Biz
	- Axio bought in 2022, and X
		- Axio: resi sales and install for resi
			- 99% of time will sell QCELLS hardware, software... total package 
		- Nfin
			- financier: mostly lease, sometimes loan
			- customer paid for generation
			- hardware from Aurora solar, I think
			- they want to know what to offer for kilowatt-hour price
			- TPO: third party ownership
- sys architecture
- sim
	- data we get for sims
		- we s/ have design data (geometry etc.) we should have
	- inputs OpenEI, NRSDB, NREL CEC DB
	- PySAM is simulator, I think
	- AngleView might be an input (open interface planned, I think)
	- Aurora has battery modeling
		- they model self-consumption
		- [ ] how do they do that?
	- Jackson talked to NREL about improving PySAM
		- Billy says we're productionalizing it
		- [ ] we're hacking it?
- Aurora will be the design and proposal tool
	- so, we'll get PV and battery data from them
	- QCELLS wants it's own sim, Aurora too expensive
	- we get params, and repeat their sim
	- they use OpenEI
	- Jackson wants us to use Arcaidia instead 
		- rates from Genability
	- Aurora is design engine, PySAM is sim engine
- JonL
	- anything NREL produces won't be realistic
	- Jackson: load will be like SSDD (one day persistent)
	- thinks our battery dispatch won't match ours, how validate
	- Jackson: need to validate that NREL is comparable to our stuff.  
		- resi accuracy not that important, so not worried
- Billy
	- roadmap has better PV modeling
	- but stopgap meas. in place ("Doug's work was stopped"?)
- JonL
	- what is horizon of revenue forecast
		- Jackson: 
			- 25 years
			- mostly about 1st year, extrapolated w/ degradation model
	- logic for degradation from SAM:
		- % per per year for PV
		- some curve for battery degradation
	- opt in VPP?
		- we're doing it somehow
- Aug 30 is biz goal for validated sim service, bankable
- VPP comes in later, I think
