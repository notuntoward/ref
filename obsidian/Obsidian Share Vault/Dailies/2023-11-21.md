# NEM Missing Data Bug
- [Can't download October 2022 Predispatch forecast · Issue #56 · UNSW-CEEM/NEMSEER · GitHub](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/NEMSEER/issues/56#issuecomment-1813701125)
	- response was that this is a NEM problem, contact AEMO
- Message I sent to the [AEMO data contact page](https://aemo.com.au/en/contact-us)
  
	Can't download October 2022 Predispatch forecast
	
	Following NEM data file naming conventions, I'd expect the October 2022 Predispatch table contents to be in:
	
	http://www.nemweb.com.au/Data_Archive/Wholesale_Electricity/MMSDM/2022/MMSDM_2022_10/MMSDM_Historical_Data_SQLLoader/PREDISP_ALL_DATA/PUBLIC_DVD_PREDISPATCHPRICE_202210010000.zip
	
	However, that file isn't in that directory.  Instead, there is a file with basename:
	
	PUBLIC_DVD_PREDISPATCHCONSTRAINT1_202210010000.zip
	
	Is this the only data available for October?  And if so, what does data in this file mean?
	
	If there is other data, could you add it to this directory?  Our automated downloading services expect one with the basename:
	
	PUBLIC_DVD_PREDISPATCHPRICE_202210010000.zip
	
	Thanks,
	
	Scott
