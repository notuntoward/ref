# Automatic List Renumbering Plugin
From: [GitHub - OmriLeviGit/Automatic-Renumbering-Obsidian: Automatically renumber numbered lists in Obsidian as you edit them.](https://github.com/OmriLeviGit/Automatic-Renumbering-Obsidian)

I'm not sure what this does.  The only thing new I can see in the docs is that you can preserve a starting list number other that 1.  But that doesn't seem to work...

**Uninstalled**  Doesn't sem to do anything I want to do.
