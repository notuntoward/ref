# Minimal theme kills pdf reader

My bug report: [scrolling a pdf slows, then st...](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal/issues/751).  

The first solution was:
- Go to **Style Settings → PDFs → Blend PDFs** in light mode and set to **OFF**
- You do this if you want the pages to blend into the background color, e.g. on warm schemes like flexoki
- Since I'm using light backgrounds, I don't need to do this.
- Also, some say that using [any custom theme can slow down obsidian](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1cjxnnn/comment/l8bbwqp/?%24deep_link=true&correlation_id=b4faa852-d744-45a2-8d46-6e640d161144&ref=email_comment_reply&ref_campaign=email_comment_reply&ref_source=email)
- [x] Unfortunately, this worked on only one doc, and failed on the next: reopen the bug.
