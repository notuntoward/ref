# CustomJS Plugin
From: [GitHub - saml-dev/obsidian-custom-js: An Obsidian plugin to allow users to reuse code blocks across all devices and OSes](https://github.com/saml-dev/obsidian-custom-js)

When invoked, it's supposed to pop up a list of your custom javascripts to run, but all I've been able to get was an empty pane that said "no results found".  My plan was to use this to make toggle panes for properties and outlines, following [perplexity advice]([https://www.perplexity.ai/search/in-github-is-there-a-way-to-re-_reqeXbiRQml.ck0N4AQdg#0](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/in-obsidian-many-commands-open-DEDjamHuR1uYhkTACkTahw#8)).

- My bug report: [Can't find custom java scripts...](https://github.com/saml-dev/obsidian-custom-js/issues/97)

**Disabled** don't waste time with this unless plugin author responds.
