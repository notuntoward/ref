# Streamline Your Literature Reviews: A Powerful Reading Workflow for Academics Using Obsidian and Zotero
From [here](https://share.note.sx/e612da498b038c3e5e367043782e2b59)
- Kanban driven autodownloader from Zotero
- looks nice, but lots of configs and plugins required
**Take note but skip for now**
# Editor Width Slider plugin
From [here](https://github.com/MugishoMp/obsidian-editor-width-slider)
- puts a slider at the bottom that controls end of line word wrap
- nice to usually have
- narrow pages for readability
- but also nice to have wide tables
- so this offers useful flexibility
- **However** it has no effect when I'm using [[2024-04-02#Minimal Theme plugin]], which I'm liking.
- **Does** work on Anappucin theme, though, which I'm also liking.

**Disabled but keep it around if I switch to some non-minimal theme**

# Force View Of Note Plugin
From: [here](https://github.com/bwydoogh/obsidian-force-view-mode-of-note)

A bit of yaml in a note forces it to open in source, live, or preview mode.  Could be useful for forcing [[2024-04-11#Dataview plugin]] query pages to be live when you open them e.g. [[Lit Note Summary]].  *But is a plugin really needed for this?*

**Remember this, but don't install yet**

# Literature Note Improvements
## Dataview Table / Note Class

The [[2024-04-11#Dataview plugin]]  table [[Lit Note Summary]] is fine, but I might want to do something fancier.  Since the automatic [[2024-03-09#Zotero Integration Plugin]] has its own nunjucks templates, I *probably don't want something that makes its own templates*, especially if I have to click on them separately.

1. `status` property s/b specific to literature notes e.g. `LNstatus` or something, in order to avoid collisions w/ all the other possible uses of a "status" property.
2. **OR** I could leave it as `status`, which looks better in the table, but I need some idea of a property namespace.
3. Would be nice to have a fixed set of values for `status`: read, unread, partly read...
4. This could probably be done with some kind of `document class`, like what I believe is available in [Metadata Menu](https://mdelobelle.github.io/metadatamenu/).  But as suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1awzv0z/metabind_meta_data_menu_or_database/), there are alternatives to consider:
	1. [Metadata Menu](https://mdelobelle.github.io/metadatamenu/)
	2. [Projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects)
	3. [Meta Bind](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin): puts field in a note; spreadsheet-like calcs
	4. [Database Folder](https://rafaelgb.github.io/obsidian-db-folder/): maybe not, though, as it seems to make the whole doc, not just look at properties
## Better dates in Zotero Integration nunjucks template

Consider:
- created: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}
- instead of read/unread, have "date read".  Thing is, I want a single click which sets it to today.
## Author-Programmer

Fix [[Lit Note Summary]] so that it has a `firstAuthor` for `Programmers`, as in [Hughes23VectaraHallucLdrBrd](app://obsidian.md/lit/lit_notes/Hughes23VectaraHallucLdrBrd.md)

# Media Notes plugin
From [here](https://github.com/jemstelos/obsidian-media-notes?tab=readme-ov-file)

An alternative to [[2023-10-17#Timestamp Notes Plugin]] that leaves small timestamp links that you can move around, put in an outline.  Might be worthwhile, but alternative [[2023-10-17#Media Extended Plugin]] might be fancier than this in the future.
- one catch: must add `media_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFXWY8TqSWw` to the note's properties, where the URL is pasted in manually
- to run the video, you install a bookmarklet that triggers the timestamp being posted in your obsidian page.
- but links are bare text markdown, so OK if this plugin dies
- last update was 2 weeks ago (from 4/3/24)

**Try it sometime...**
# Media Extended plugin
From [here](https://github.com/PKM-er/media-extended)

An alternative to [[2023-10-17#Timestamp Notes Plugin]] that makes bare links in bullets that you can move around. Far more elaborate than TSP, or [[#Media Notes plugin|Media Notes plugin]], with paid AI features, etc., if you want them, and more built-in media controls.  It works well enough.  But the video interrupted by [incredibly long advertisements](https://github.com/PKM-er/media-extended/issues/340) -- I'll have to uninstall it if this continues.

**Installed**
## Media Extended plugin points of interest
- shows video in a sidepane, is reopened if you click on a timestamp after you open it
	- open it w/ command `Open media`
- clicks on star makes a bulleted timestamp
- click on camera makes a screenshot and a tiemstamp (screenshot is tiny, but you can expand it to fullsize.
- this goes in a page it creates for you, but I guess you could copy them out
- to put links in some other note, run the commands from there e.g. `Take timestamp` makes a link (must make some hotkeys for this) 
- [ ] this is rather fiddly: there must be a better way...
- has a **bunch** of commands, 20 of them
- to put notes in some other 
- can pin media player tab so it's the only one links will open, even if you're clicking on several different videos
- works on local files or various websites
- If I uninstall the plugin and click on the a video link, it just goes to YouTube, so it's future proof.
- last update was 2 weeks ago (from 4/3/24)
- My [request to not take over youtube links](https://github.com/PKM-er/media-extended/issues/325#issuecomment-2040912151)
- My bug report on [advertisement interruptions in media player](https://github.com/PKM-er/media-extended/issues/340).
## Hotkey: Media Extended plugin
It has none out of the box.  Here are my initial mappings:

### Media Extended Hotkeys

| shortcut      | command           |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| ctrl-shift-y  | open media        |
| ctrl-[        | Take timestamp    |
| ctrl-spacebar | pause and restart |
| ctrl-right    | foreward 1s       |
| ctrl-left     | back 5s           |
