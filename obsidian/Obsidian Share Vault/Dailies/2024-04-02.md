# Better Export PDF plugin
From: [here](https://github.com/l1xnan/obsidian-better-export-pdf)

Another pdf exporter, comparable to [[2024-03-27#Enhancing Export plugin]] for pdfs. It works well on pdfs.  
- Links work, zotero lit notes w/ callouts and stuff are OK (exported expanded), etc.
- If import that into word, link work, headlines collapse and expand.
- Is this needed?  [[2024-03-06#Pandoc Export Plugin]] works well on both Word and PDF exports.  Easier to keep just one thing going, avoid confusion

**Uninstalled**

# Minimal Theme plugin
[Documentation](https://minimal.guide/home)

- [ ] How do deal with [widths](https://minimal.guide/features/block-width)
- [ ] Is there a slightly less faded, higher contrast light [color scheme](https://minimal.guide/features/color-schemes)?
	- [E-ink mode](https://minimal.guide/features/eink) (beta) comes is total black and white, so high contrast, but some menus don't render
- Easy settings navigation with the [[2024-03-22#Style Settings Plugin]]
- Embeds can blend into rest of text, if set the whatever-it-was minimal setting
### Embed test (this works great!)
