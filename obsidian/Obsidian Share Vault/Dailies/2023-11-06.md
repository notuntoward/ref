### Workspaces in Obsidian
- I made a feature request: [Workspaces save folder open/closed configuration in files sidebar](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/workspaces-save-folder-open-closed-configuration-in-files-sidebar/70828)
### Mtng: AEMO Price Forecasting w/ View
- Immediate need
	- gen and forecasted
	- summed to region
	- Hydro
	- Util Solar
	- Wind
- Next
	- "outage information" predictive of high prices
- View points
	- PASA data
		- it's forecast
		- "dispatchable": includes hydro
			- forecast on capacity
				- [ ] she'll look into how reliable it is
				- it's in PASA data
				- medium term DUID
				- 7 days outlook (usually the def'n of "short term")
				- [ ] she'll look into definition
			- [ ] view will look into composite forecast that has hydro, gas and coal
		- [ ] View will look for something net-demand, max capacity shortage forecast
		- opennem software: they can sort this out but DUID table is manual
			- [ ] I'll help look into code to see if they have a smarter DUID
			- opennem can only look at back-looking or PASA, which 
			- they have backlooking hydro but not forecast
		- summed forecast that has hydro in it: 
		- forecasts in PASA are capacity forecast not generation
		- semi-scheduled (exclusively wind and solar)
		- util scale wind and solar
			- 24 hours (1/2 hr res) and 1hrs (5min res)
			- short term: 1 wk ahead (hourly)
			- [ ] medium term: coarser, she'll check
		- [ ] PASA -> SHORT TERM PASA -> are actually regional
		- non-scheduled generator
- [ ] View will look at rule changes on STPASA
- she'll be out from this coming Friday for weeks to come
