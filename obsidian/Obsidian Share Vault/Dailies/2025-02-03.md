# Pane Relief Plugin
From:[GitHub - pjeby/pane-relief: Obsidian plugin for per-pane history, pane movement/navigation hotkeys, and more](https://github.com/pjeby/pane-relief)

I wanted a simple `duplicate tab` command and one for `unsplitting` split windows.  Not sure this did that, and also, there is overlap with newer obsidian functions, like sliding windows (or something like that).   

The [perplexity advice](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/the-obsidian-pane-relief-plugi-HVsy8b.ATH.xDOHZ.nIqiQ#1) is to disable features on this plugin that overlap with new obsidian stuff, but there are options: only hotkeys it makes, which I guess I can disable: I disabled the ones for `ctrl+PgUp` and `ctrl+PgDwn` since they overlapped.

But in the end, it doesn't have the two functions I was looking for.

**Uninstalled**
