# Pane Relief Plugin
From:[GitHub - pjeby/pane-relief: Obsidian plugin for per-pane history, pane movement/navigation hotkeys, and more](https://github.com/pjeby/pane-relief)

I wanted a simple `duplicate tab` command and one for `unsplitting` split windows.  Not sure this did that, and also, there is overlap with newer obsidian functions, like sliding windows (or something like that).   

The [perplexity advice](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/the-obsidian-pane-relief-plugi-HVsy8b.ATH.xDOHZ.nIqiQ#1) is to disable features on this plugin that overlap with new obsidian stuff, but there are options: only hotkeys it makes, which I guess I can disable: I disabled the ones for `ctrl+PgUp` and `ctrl+PgDwn` since they overlapped.

But in the end, it doesn't have the two functions I was looking for.  Maybe what I really need is the [[Dailies/2025-02-03.md#Vertical Tabs Plugin |Vertical Tabs Plugin]]

# Tab Shifter Plugin
From: [GitHub - jsrozner/obsidian-tab-shifter](https://github.com/jsrozner/obsidian-tab-shifter)

Has a "next tab" function that goes across tab groups (panes you get when you split), and a "tab shifting" function that moves a tab to the other group.  I can imagine that the later is useful?

**Try it** 

# Vertical Tabs Plugin
From: [GitHub - oxdc/obsidian-vertical-tabs: An Obsidian plugin that displays open tabs vertically, allowing users to group and organize tabs for a better navigation experience.](https://github.com/oxdc/obsidian-vertical-tabs)

Makes a tab list in a side pane, probably easier to see what's going on, and to move tabs around. Was a [runner up for Obsidian's Best New Plugin of 2024](https://obsidian.md/blog/2024-goty-winners/).
