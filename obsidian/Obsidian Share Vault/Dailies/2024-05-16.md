# Numbered Headings plugin
From: [GitHub - onlyafly/number-headi...](https://github.com/onlyafly/number-headings-obsidian)

Add Heading numbers like 1.4.2, once you use the command for a page.  Settings are stored per-page in the frontmatter property, `number_headings`, but these aren't documented on GitHub.  See Obsidian install page for them.  

Headlines are kept up-to-date if you add the 'auto' property

**Disabled.  I'm ambivalent**
