# Pandas Tricks
From: [6 Things That You Probably Didn’t Know You Could Do with Pandas](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/6-things-that-you-probably-didnt-know-you-could-do-with-pandas-ac64751917e3)

## Custom methods using pandas-flavor library

It's easy to add a pandas method.  I could use this.

```
import pandas as pd
import pandas_flavor as pf

@pf.register_dataframe_method
def add_row(df, row):
    
    df.loc[len(df)] = row
```
## Create DataFrame from list of DataClass objects
^xz3qlq

Instead of building a list of pd.Series, and then concatenating to a dataframe, one could build a list of dataclasses, and just declare a dataframe.  Column names are dtypes (which can be different, unlike with pd.Series, are defined in the dataclass.  One thing I don't like is that this is far from a oneliner, and that the class declaration relies on argument ordering (does it?).

```
import pandas as pd
from dataclasses import dataclass
@dataclass
class Point:
    x_loc: int
    y_loc: int
    
points = [Point(1, 2),
          Point(4, 5),
          Point(3, 7)]

pd.DataFrame(points)
```

**Note**: [DataClass isn't much faster or slower](https://www.evernote.com/l/AA3SgmHs2PZPtYAKK5_rJUO/) than other fancy classes, but much slower than dicts, and especially tuples.  So dataclass --> pd.DataFrame is likely comparable, speed-wise, to concatenating a list of pd.Series, for example.  And when doing it with dataclasses, you get heterogenous dtypes, and compact dot notation assignment e.g. `dc.x_loc = 30`

# Tools for inserting code blocks

For the moment, [[#Insert Code Block (obsidian command)|Insert Code Block (obsidian command)]] is adequate, but [[#Code Block Plugin|Code Block Plugin]] and [[#Codeblock Customizer Plugin|Codeblock Customizer Plugin]] would be simpler and prettier, with tweaking.

## Insert Code Block (obsidian command)
From: obsidian built-in

An obsidian built-in that inserts a code block that you can paste your code in.  When pasting from web, avoid html confusion by pasting with `Ctrl + Alt + V`

## Code Block Plugin
From: [GitHub - paddan/code-block-plugin](https://github.com/paddan/code-block-plugin)

Auto-recognizes the language of the code chunk you paste, indents and highlights.  Correctly handles htmlized code pasted from web.

**Works!**

- Code Block: Paste code block
	- does almost exactly what I want
	- only problem is the fruity highighting colors it uses by default
		- OK in dark theme, but not great in light
		- Adjust with [[#Codeblock Customizer Plugin|Codeblock Customizer Plugin]]

- *For the moment,* until I'm doing a lot of code blocks, I'll just use [[#Insert Code Block (obsidian command)|Insert Code Block (obsidian command)]], which is decent.

## Codeblock Customizer Plugin
From: [GitHub - mugiwara85/CodeblockCustomizer: Codeblock Customizer plugin for Obsidian](https://github.com/mugiwara85/CodeblockCustomizer)

**Works!**

- Lets you customize code block colors
- Turn off "enable editor active line height" in basic settings
- built-in Obsidian and Solarized themes (both dark and light)
- simple to make your own custom theme
- can highlight bits of code, etc.
- handy companion for [[#Code Block Plugin|Code Block Plugin]]

# Excel to Markdown Table Plugin
From: [obsidian-excel-to-markdown-table](https://github.com/ganesshkumar/obsidian-excel-to-markdown-table)

**Works!**

Simply copy Excel table into Obsidian.

1. Select a square of Excel
2. copy (Excel shortcut)
3. paste (Obsidian shortcut, can paste single column if use `ctrl + alt + v` or command via `ctrl + P`)
- Result in obsidian is markdown, so loses Excel formatting.  
- But you can edit it using built-in obsidian commants
- But you still have that source Excel file lying around (somewhat easier to edit spreadsheets in Excel than in obsidian, so its likely that it *will* be laying around)

**Test** (pasted from an Excel file)

| Shortcut           | Action    | Object   | Comment                                      |
| ------------------ | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ctrl + shift + up  | Move up   | Bullet   | Good hierarchy handling, not numbered lists  |
| ctrl + shift + dwn | Move down | Bullet   |                                              |
|                    | Move up   | Numbered | Nothing                                      |
|                    | Move down | Numbered |                                              |
| tab                | Indent    | Bullet   | Same hotkeys for bullets and numbered. Good. |
| shift + tab        | Outdent   | Bullet   |                                              |
| tab                | Indent    | Numbered |                                              |
| shift + tab        | Outdent   | Numbered |                                              |

# Excel Plugin
From: [obsidian-excel](https://github.com/ljcoder2015/obsidian-excel)

It's a bit two-step, not quite as nice as OneNote or Evernote Excel embedding, and it has a bug: For now, **I've disabled it**.

- You must create a "sheet file" on a separate obsidian page
	- Create the .sheet file using `Create Excel` command.
	- can manually import/export from real Excel sheet 
		- Will lose some formatting 
		- e.g. cell fill colors, both from/to .sheet file
	- .sheet file is editable
- Then, embed the .sheet file on a normal obsidian page
- Too bad you can't edit the embed
- Can leave two other "Excel" files are lying around: the original Excel source, if there is one, and the .sheet file
- [Bug](https://github.com/ljcoder2015/obsidian-excel/issues/45): sheet looks fine in live preview, but in View, shows only one column
- In the meantime, just use the same simple cut and paste in [[#Excel to Markdown Table Plugin|Excel to Markdown Table Plugin]]

# Better Command Palette Plugin
From: [better-command-palette: A better command palette for obsidian](https://github.com/AlexBieg/obsidian-better-command-palette)

Makes command palette more like the modern emacs M-x, with frequent commands bubbling up, can pin commands, etc. Also merges in searches and quick not switching, so fewer keys to hit.

**My current hotkeys**
`ALT + X` Better command palette (like Emacs `M-x`).  See [[2024-06-18#My Emacs Hotkeys]]

**My initial hotkeys**
`ctrl + p`: Better Command Palette
`ctrl + shift + P`: Stock Command Palette

<u>Current uses (more coming)</u>
1. Use backspace to close the palette
2. Recent choices bubble to the top
3. Built in quick switcher by typing `/` or using the hotkey
4. Built in tag search by typing `#` or using the hotkey
5. Search files with specific tags
6. Macro commands
7. Hide less useful Commands, Files, and Tag, but quickly see them again with `cmd+i`

One thing I'd like is if it had VIM-style command navigation that's optional in [[#Omnisearch plugin|Omnisearch plugin]]
- [x] My request: [Feature Request: VIM navigation to match Omnisearch · Issue #109](https://github.com/AlexBieg/obsidian-better-command-palette/issues/109)
- [ ] Is the heading search broken as of 7/5/2024?
# Omnisearch plugin
From: [GitHub - scambier/obsidian-omnisearch: A search engine that "just works" for Obsidian. Supports OCR and PDF indexing.](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch)

Far better searching than stock vault search (although stock All File Search, `ctrl + shift + f` is not bad).  I like it's VIM-style navigation of search results too.  

I do prefer the stock file search, `ctrl + f` so I haven't replaced it with Omni File Search. 

**My hotkeys**
`ctrl + o`: Omnisearch Vault Search
`ctrl + shift + o`: stock Find All Files

# Refactoring / Editing Hotkey plugins
## Keyshots plugin
From: [obsidian-keyshots](https://github.com/KrazyManJ/obsidian-keyshots)

A ton of shortcuts in one place.  If I used this, I could delete some plugins, and get a couple new shortcuts, like a bunch of multi-toggles, regexp replacement.  Has an option to clear all hotkeys, so I can avoid a ton of conflicts, and add the hotkeys I like one-by-one.

- [ ] <span style="color:#ffc000">Try it</span>

## Smarter MD Hotkeys
From: [smarter-md-hotkeys](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/obsidian-smarter-md-hotkeys)

For one, it has a headline toggle.  Finally!  A bunch of other good things too, comparable but slightly different than [[#Keyshots plugin|Keyshots plugin]].

- [ ] <span style="color:#ffc000">Try it.</span>

## Keyboard Analyzer plugin
From: [keyboard analyzer](https://github.com/cogscides/obsidian-keyboard-analyzer)

Maybe a better way to deal with hotkey conflicts and organization?  Comparable to [[2024-03-23#Hotkey Helper Plugin]]

- [x] Tried it.  Seems useful.

## Editor Commands Remap plugin
From [here](https://github.com/c4ctus5/editor-commands-remap)

Exposes some hidden Obsidian commands.  Maybe

- `toggleFold` : fold or unfold item at current position

is worth looking at?

- [ ] <span style="color:#ffc000">Try it.</span>
