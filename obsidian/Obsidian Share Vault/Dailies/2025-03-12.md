# Navigate Cursor History Plugin
From: [GitHub - heycalmdown/navigate-...](https://github.com/heycalmdown/navigate-cursor-history)
- This was close but not quite
	- So I submitted this feature request: 
	  [Navigate "views" in addition to cursor position · Issue #20](https://github.com/heycalmdown/navigate-cursor-history/issues/20)
- my "does this work? question": [Does this still work? · Issue ...](https://github.com/heycalmdown/navigate-cursor-history/issues/24#issuecomment-2716956903)
	- answer from somebody seems to be "no".  Instead, try [[Dailies/2025-03-12.md#Cursor History Plugin |Cursor History Plugin]]
# Cursor History Plugin
From: [GitHub - fgubler/obsidian-curs...](https://github.com/fgubler/obsidian-cursor-position-history)

- maybe a working version of [[Dailies/2025-03-12.md#Navigate Cursor History Plugin |Navigate Cursor History Plugin]]
- also remembers cursor position the last time you were in a note
	- like [[Dailies/2024-03-25.md#Remember Cursor Position Plugin |Remember Cursor Position Plugin]] (which I have been using, and works)
	- but Cursor History Plugin works too, so if its cursor history part works, I could avoid an extra plugin
- the cursor position history does work
	- ! when going from one document to the next, I think it doesn't return to the last position in the old doc.  A bit flakey...
- [ ] @ find a keyboard mapping for cursor history
