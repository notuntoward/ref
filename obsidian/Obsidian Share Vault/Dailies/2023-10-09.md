### Excel-like tables in Obsidian

**Problem**: Editing markdown tables is a mess, column content skips around, is misaligned.  Worse than emacs, far worse than Evernote, and far far worse than Excel.  *Can I just make a starter table and copy it into Obsidian?*

**Conclusion** Yes.  Start with excel-to-markdown-table plugin

- Plugin: [obsidian-excel-to-markdown-table](https://github.com/ganesshkumar/obsidian-excel-to-markdown-table)
	- copy in Excel; paste into Obsidian (Ctrl-Alt-V ?)
	- result is plain old Markdown table, with all its limitations
	- works as long as
		- you don't have blank column headers
		- merged columns (column name spanning two sub-columns under it)
	- [Obsidian - Excel to Markdown Table - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-4TDppWM1w)
- Plugin: [obsidian-excel](https://github.com/ljcoder2015/obsidian-excel)
	- put Excel sheet in Vault
	- an view it in Obsidian
	- from docs, looks good (maybe) but adds a javascript lib dependency, markdown will probably be a mess
	- plugin looks brand new, untested?
	- uses x-spreadsheet javascript tool
	- not clear if you can mix Excel view of the table with markdown on the page
