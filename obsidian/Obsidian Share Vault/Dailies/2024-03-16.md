# PDF annotating in Obsidian
- good video: [PDF++: The Best PDF Plugin For Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dU6WXULSqg)
## Built-in Obsidian PDF annotator

<u>It's not bad</u>: a couple ways to get a link to an exact location in a pdf, very much like links to an obsidian page block.  But unlike with obsidian block annotation, this doesn't leave anything in the original document; in the pdf itself, selection highlights just disappear when you select something else, or close the pdf.

The links you paste into an obsidian page are in plain markdown.  Markdown doesn't a standard for this that I can find, so this must be an Obsidian-specific format.  But they look easy to parse them if you ever wanted to get out of obsidian.
### Test built-in
- Test *without PDF++ plugin installed*
- open a pdf that's in the vault
- highlight something, and right click to select type of copy, the paste

**copy**: just get the string
	utual information is a fundamental measure o
	
**quote**: get the quote, with a clickable link back to the pdf
> Remark 10.1 (Comments) Note the following:

[[PDFAnnotationTestDoc.pdf#page=1&selection=115,0,117,19|PDFAnnotationTestDoc, page 1]]

**link** to election: just get a clickable link 
  [[PDFAnnotationTestDoc.pdf#page=1&selection=144,0,144,57|PDFAnnotationTestDoc, page 1]]

### PDF++ plugin
From [here](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-pdf-plus)

Can paste many kinds of links into an Obsidian page.  The highlights you min the pdf persist, either in some obsidian DB, or in the pdf itself (but maybe the obsidian highlight DB remains no matter what.)  
- Highlights can be four customizable colors, with a nice pallet to click on
- "select text to copy" mode will copy link right after selection is done, which I prefer.  Otherwise, must both select and then click on the color pallet (or right click) to copy the highlight.
	- There's a LHS ribbon highlight icon for setting/unsetting this mode.  The icon is configurable in settings
- weird that highlights don't show unless you paste them into Obsidian -- **I don't want that!**
- quotes on obsidian page have same color as pdf highlight (nice)
- "quoting callout" type allows you to type your own comment within the callout.
- <u>Underlines</u> instead of highlights are optional, but you you have to change that in the settings, and when you change that *all* of you highlights will be switched to (kinda thin & hard to see) underlines, even ones you made previously.  So not fantastic.
- Backlinks
	- **pdf backlinks**!  double click on a highlight in a pdf and you'll go to the obsidian page where the link to it is stored.
	- bot obsidian page and pdf have links and backlinks to each other
- rectangular selection is handy, resizable w/ the image plugin I already have installed.  There are many options for what gets pasted 
	- [x] look @ rectangular selection options
- autofocus-autopaste setting pastes link to obsidian page immediately after selection is copied.
- highlights, etc. *aren't written to pdf by default*, you must set something: 
- can split large pdfs; links will be automatically updated
- when link is copied you can automatically 
	- focus an obsidian page (many options for which page)
	- video guy shows another option that also pastes it, but that seems to be gone now.
	- there's an icon on the LHS ribbon allowing you to toggle this mode.
- Can configure hover editor popup on pdf when you mouse over a link that's not already opened; click on link to open pdf (setting "how to open markdown file when not opened).  
	- see pdf if just hover on obsidian page
	- in pdf, you see page if hover w/ control
	- I like this.
- all pdf annotations show up in obsidian pdf viewer e.g. text boxes, ink, etc.
- They also show up even if you haven't linked them back to the note, which would be good b/c I could do init markup w/ external pdf editor and then go back and copy some links back to obs page
- Getting external pdf annotation into obsidian note
	- click on them and a copy/edit/delete icon pops up; if copy, you can paste into obsidian, and everything works
		- [x] different behavior later: make a GitHub Issue
			- [x] external highlights copied to obsidian
				- double click goes to page
				- single click gives a link edit menu (can comment, edit delete) 
				- middle click: nothing
			- highlights made by ++PDF
				- double click: go to page
				- single click: nothing
				- middle click: change color menu
			- Note that you don't see these behaviors on existing links (either external or ++PDF) if "select text to copy" mode is turned on. 
	- there's a ++PDF command to extract ALL existing highlights from pdf from another annotator
		- you then paste them into your note
		- colors in obs page and pdf backlinks work on these
		- This will be thousands with my usual definition thing, so individual (above) is probably best most of the time
- [x] No way to delete a link made by PDF++?
	- odd b/c can delete external links, I think.
- [x] "Enable PDF Editing" setting is supposed to write your annotations to the pdf file, but it only works sometimes.  Not clear to me if it's supposed to save all, all the time, or some, when it's turned on or what.
	-  clicking the "add highlights to file directly" icon, so it's darkened doesn't do anything.
- page editing commands
	- Add, insert, remove or extract PDF page (works even if don't have pdf editing enabled?)
## Bugs and Feature Requests: PDF++
- [x] Submit a GitHub issue
	-  When making a pdf++ highlight, you can write by selecting the right button "write" menus, but there's not a way to reliably do this all the time, for all annotations.
- [x] [Search arrow points in wrong d...](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-pdf-plus/issues/244)
- [ ] auto copy of link doesn't work when highlight.  Does sometimes?  but I can't figure out when.
- [ ] Better if R-menu had the "copy link" icon on it, instead of buried under a 2nd thing in the single-click menu.  Even better would be hotkey to do this (next)
- [ ] Need delete and copy highlight keys
- [ ] Need a single button to save all highlights.  The blank flash with the auto-save is too annoying and sluggishly slow.
