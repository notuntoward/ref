# JonD Mtng: AEMO price forecast types/timing/horizons: 2023-11-03

^1fbcg0

This started with questions I came up while doing this OneNote doodle: [AEMO price forecast features](onenote:https://d.docs.live.net/4bbd96b3698748f8/Documents/Geli/priceFrcstAEMO.one#AEMO%20price%20forecast%20features&section-id={7D480E6A-BF05-4D0A-AA7B-D26AB3EFF72D}&page-id={BC93D8AD-0991-4E73-BBAC-8E81C2AD3306}&end)

- horizons
	- 2 spikes per day @ duck curve
	- [ ] Scott study # spikes/day, possible charging gaps between
- battery discharge power
	- 2 hr ==> divide by 5 min periods
	- Jon's thought: weight top N prices (2 hours worth (discharge))
- less temporal precision wrt horizon
	- not necessary to have uniform time resolution
- problems
	- forecasted price higher in near future but they're actually lower in future
	- kind of a 4 hours timespan
	- opt going for abs best solution but 
- charge policy
	- how often
		- right now: 
			- 10-12:00: dumb self-consumption.  charge of solar, discharge locally
			- anything allowed (configurable): 5-10pm (highest prices 6:30-8:00pm)
			- but they probably don't charge during 5-10pm
		- actual price known for current periods for only a minute or two
		- will charge between 5-10, if it makes sense.
		- battery charged by 50% by 5pm 
	- timing?
	- policy
	- battery is ~ 2 hours long
	- customers didn't like battery jumping up and down a lot: solution
		- constrain behavior: charge once per day
		- free to do what you want between 5-10 pm (he'll check with Yixhen to see if we're restricted there)
- battery hours @ max charge power?
- probabilistic
	- expected value for foreseeable future is what's wanted
	- but maybe useful: chance of a price spike over some threshold
	- ERCOT might use stock prices but Gerrit only "working on it"
- prefer sliding 24 hour window or constant clock time forecast window
- priorities
	- 1st forecasted price is the most important
	- they're trying to short circuit the current forecast now b/c it's so bad
	- 1st 5-15 mins is most imp
	- 2-4 hours-ish out
		- b/c it's the duration of the peak period
		- price peak: 6:30-8:00pm is where very high prices exist, mostly
- forecast horizon length
	- sliding window, fixed length
	- max horizon: 6 hours is OK for most use
	- they'll tack on pd if necessary themselves
- Running sims
	- I put forecasts in "analytics database"
	- separately run forecast, fake it, by calling it a KNN forecast (that already exists)
	- optimizer gets forecast from database and runs over it
	- the optimizer looper over time, exists in analytics somewhere
	- when have candidate prototype optimizers
		- one branch per optimizer version
		- no switch 
		- all optimizers (ERCOT, VDER, ...) are all in each branch
		- configuration: 
			- tells you what variables and constraints to construct
			- config is in a json file (and other options), goes to a configuration object
			- could *possibly* construct multiple optimizer versions based on starting it w/ different configs
	- thinks we should make a text file interface for foreasts (Amir did)
