# Yearly Review Goal Weightings Meeting w/ Nace

Regarding the weightings he needs for this year's goal.  Here's the list and his preliminary table

![[2023-12-07-20231207104526046.webp|815]]
- Nace says
	- VDER succeeded
	- batt modeling: succeed
	- long term forecasting support removed
	- AEMO not productization
		- says productization a extra credit
	- MLOPs only 10%, will consider extenuating circumstances
	- I'm absolved of software arch goal
	- I won't get a "2" this year
	- I'm allowed to set up meetings w/ Ben and Abhi to find out what's going on
# Gotion Meeting
- mystery meeting I was CC'ed on the invite to
- Gotion is apparently a Chinese battery maker that QCELLS had plans to buy batteries from. Seems like it might happen by 2025
- Devon Wilson, of Devon was the speaker
- Gotion has a 300Ah cell, 
- developing a 316 Ah cell
	- will be 1st US product
	- 5MWh battery back: GRID 5047 BESS
	- this will be a domestically (US) produced cell
	- will be made in China first ~ sept 2024
	- US cell production ~ Q4 2024.  Mateno IL, USA
	- containerization A1 2025
	- will get it UL certified in China 1st
- Means QCELL must move from 330 Ah cell to 316 Ah cell, if wants US produced
- Kyle Moore (QCELLS?): need a bunch of info on 330 Ah pack (will QCELLS still use it somewhere?)
	- QCELLs wants a "long cell," seems like 316 is that
	- has "thirst for design data," like how to integrate it w/ QCELLS cooling, etc.
	- wants weekly tech meeting
- Wilson: US team as a hard time getting design info from China
	- They're worried about info getting back to other Chinese manufacturers
- Moore: use Chinese made 316's 1st (for engineering development?  I wasn't clear on why), then will US 316's be the same?  Wilson says yes, will be UL certified in China, so won't change
- Moore: says domestic content is why we went with the 330?  So it won't be anymore: is this a change?  (to the 315)
- "short pack 3.42" will be containerized in US starting 4/1/24, will get the containerization process working in the US first.  But packs are made in China.
# Forecasting Group meeting
- [ ] add confluence page about Gotion meeting
- Abhi will have sagemaker environment for AEMO ready next week
- Amir a price peak/trough picker algorithm that somehow is nearly as good as Enverus in terms of RMS, but better at getting timing right.  Tests is somehow w/ Optimization's Julia optimizer.
- Nace points out that this optimizer isn't what the AEMO optimizer does, so this is probably not going to work.
