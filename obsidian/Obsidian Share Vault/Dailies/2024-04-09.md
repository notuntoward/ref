# Collecting Lit Note TODOs

Using hints from [[2024-04-06#Meeting Notes Template Video]], I made [[Lit Note TODOs]], which worked on the first try, amazingly.  The dataview queries were:
# `TODOs`
`dataview`
 `TASK`
 `FROM "lit/lit_notes"`
 `WHERE !completed` 
# `Done TODOs`
`dataview`
 `TASK`
 `FROM "lit/lit_notes"`
 `WHERE completed` 

**Above, I removed the triple quotes so it won't run here.**
# Move Meeting note out of daily, leaving link
## Templater Quick Capture with Hotkey

I don't want to do this, but [this video](https://youtu.be/9w_BQHH3ptY?t=1164) shows how Templater can make a hotkey that adds the thought you type into the prompt to the end of a global Quick Capture Note.

**For me**, points of interest in the video are:
- prompts
- hotkey to template
- somewhere (this video), it shows how to move a note.
## Select all (meeting note) text under headline

For selecting what to move out of daily note.
- [ ] # In templater, how to select all under a (enclosing?) headline
## Project structure
Where should the meeting note be moved to?  
- See [[2024-04-06#Meeting Notes Template Video]] for a clue
