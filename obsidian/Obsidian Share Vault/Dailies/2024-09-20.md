# Advanced URI Plugin
From [GitHub - Vinzent03/obsidian-ad...](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri)

More specific links, links that can do commands, esp. good for putting Obsidian in external programs e.g. OneNote.

- used for [[2023-10-08#OneNote <--> Obsidian Links|OneNote <--> Obsidian Links]]
- Advanced URI plugin is useful for finer links than page ^k4t6gw
	- **However**: [[2024-03-28#Links plugin|Links plugin]] (copy link to element command) is very nice for headline and block links 
	- [obsidian-advanced-uri: Advanced modes for Obsidian URI](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri) ^iuo48e
	- Makes URI links usable by external programs ^mgc1lg
	- Has other functions too ^dunzt4
	- Links plugin is better for linking to headlines, but advanced URI's are better than using bookmarks ^mnpcmg
		- since [obsidian-consistent-attachments-and-links plugin](https://github.com/dy-sh/obsidian-consistent-attachments-and-links) will keep them updated. ^upggc6
	- Could make an advanced URI plugin link hotkey like my Emacs dedicated target thing, but again, Links plugin copy-link-to-element is better ^ubmj74

**Installed**
