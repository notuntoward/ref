# Tasks Plugin
From [here](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)

Collect tasks across pages using a dataview (?) query. My test page ([[Task Summary]]) uses a query from [here](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks?tab=readme-ov-file#create-your-first-tasks-search).

- Annoying popup every time you do `- [ ]`
	- makes you select a date or something
	- if you don't, it doesn't show up on the query page.
- Gemini or Copilot had advice about how to avoid the popup, but who knows if it's correct.
