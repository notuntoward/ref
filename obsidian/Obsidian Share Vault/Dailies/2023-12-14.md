# AEMO catchup meeting w/ View
- View's next step: look for outages in blogs, see what features she can find, affect price spike
- Short price spikes last week: she thinks it's market gaming
	- a gen puts high price
	- reach peak demand, slips into high demand and this high price gets into the marginal price
	- predictive features could be forecasted demand
	- would look at published AEMO from AEMO: but that comes before 
	- individual bids are available a day late
	- so two features
	- View will think about it some more
- View's opinion about getting new price forecast
	- she's talked to nectar about us working on it, but no time
	- not urgent/urgent but will help the product
	- but she says a month later is fine, as no pressure from customer
- Price spikes right now in AUS:
	- yesterday: 37C
