# Checklist Progress Plugin
From [checklist-progress](https://github.com/acidghost/obsidian-checklist-progress)
- Kind of like the [1/3] tasked completed in org-mode, which I like,
- Syntax is
	- `(/)` or `(-/)` for completed or incomplete counts
	- (%) or (-/) for completed or incomplete percentage
- but 
	- hierarchy doesn't work correctly
	- doesn't do anything if `()` is on a bullet; does something if it's on a bare line
	
**Disable but watch for bug fixes**.  It's a new plugin, and I sometimes like this in emacs.
# Smart Connections Visualizer Plugin
From:[GitHub - Mossy1022/Smart-Conne...](https://github.com/Mossy1022/Smart-Connections-Visualizer)

Like a local graph view, but distance from current note to related note is proportional to relevance, as determined by [[2024-04-11#Smart Connections plugin|Smart Connections plugin]]. At the moment, all you can get is a "spokes on a wheel" graph (no 2nd order nodes, or organization my mutual organization clusters).  But fancier stuff is [promised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbFRyJBkxS0&t=2s).

**Disable for now** Not usefulness added to the connections ordered link list, but watch for improvements.
# Lineage Plugin
From [GitHub - ycnmhd/obsidian-linea...](https://github.com/ycnmhd/obsidian-lineage?tab=readme-ov-file)

Sort of a graphical outliner based on blocks, a clone of the [ginkowriter](https://gingkowriter.com/) word processor. Is supposed to encourage you to work on small, doable chunks, and I can imagine this works for people who like cards.  But when zoomed back, and looking at a deep level, it's hard to read all the small text.

It's all text based, so it its own markdowny syntax to the document, and it's compatible with whatever markdown you have started with.  You can export back to markdown, too, which works fine, although I might have found a bug during my tinkering.

Since Lineage is just an outliner, I think I'd prefer Emacs org-mode, or even ordinary Obsidian, if I ever get the heading and bullet folding, and so on, to work to my satisfaction.

**Disabled** It's is kind of interesting. See what the updates rae.
