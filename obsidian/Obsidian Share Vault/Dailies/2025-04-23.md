# Headings in Explorer Plugin
From: [GitHub - patrickchiang/obsidia...](https://github.com/patrickchiang/obsidian-headings-in-explorer)

Makes clickable headings in note explorer, so it's all in one place, which could be nice.  But headings always visible (don't like that), and it's been 11 months since the last update.

**Disabled**: if I ever see updates, I'll know it's not abandoned, and worth trying more.
