# Harper Plugin
From: [GitHub - elijah-potter/harper-...](https://github.com/elijah-potter/harper-obsidian-plugin)

A crude grammar checker with all the code running inside of obsidian. Looks very configurable.

# Geulo YouTube liked video plugin
From: [GitHub - zzunebye/obsidian-goo...](https://github.com/zzunebye/obsidian-google-liked-video)

Fetches your liked YouTube videos, and helps you organize them. ⇔ 

**Interesting. Try it sometime.**

# Lazy Plugin Loader
From: [GitHub - alangrainger/obsidian...](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-lazy-plugins)

Speeds up obsidian startup by selectively delaying plugin loading, kind of like what I did in my `.emacs`

**Try sometime** if obsidian startup time becomes a problem. Maybe it would be a big deal on mobile?

# KeepSidian plugin
From: [GitHub - lc0rp/KeepSidian](https://github.com/lc0rp/KeepSidian)

Will eventually sync Google Keep and Obsidian, but for now, it's only a one-way download.
- I'm only interested in syncing, especially since [standard obsidian can already import from Keep](https://help.obsidian.md/import/google-keep)
- And, I can already display Keep in obsidian with the [[2024-04-07#Custom Frames plugin|Custom Frames plugin]]

**Install but disable** so updates will remind me, alert when syncing is implemented.

# Spellcheck Toggler Plugin
From: [GitHub - julzerinos/spellcheck...](https://github.com/julzerinos/spellcheck-toggler-obsidian-plugin)

I'm using this to turn off spell checking for external links. Gets rid of ugly red jagged lines in, for example, links to GitHub repos.

<u>Options</u>
- "Enable spellcheck for external links" - enable the spellcheck behavior for external links (default: off)
- "Enable spellcheck for internal links" - enable the spellcheck behavior for internal links (default: off)
- "Enable spellcheck for html comments" - enable the spellcheck behavior for html comments (default: on)

**Installed**
