# Quick Capture (with Google Keep)
From [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eic-SmIMG2Y)

Uses GK to capture on phone in a bunch of ways, then opens it up on his PC and copies it into Obsidian
- video commenter, Gourav Verma, says he uses [[#Quick Frames plugin|Quick Frames plugin]] to embed GK in Obsidian
- video guy likes the idea, did it, [tweeted a screenshot](https://twitter.com/zsviczian/status/1539485302368129024) 
	- it's what he does now.
- [ ] I might want to use google keep widget on my phone
- Note that [standard Obsidian Import can import from Google Keep](https://help.obsidian.md/import/google-keep)

**This works**

# Custom Frames plugin
From [here](https://github.com/Ellpeck/ObsidianCustomFrames)

Allows you to embed web apps e.g. Google Keep, into an obsidian frame -- has [presets](https://github.com/Ellpeck/ObsidianCustomFrames?tab=readme-ov-file#-presets) for that, and Google calendar. Used, at least for [[#Quick Capture (with Google Keep)|Quick Capture (with Google Keep)]].

- Not really integrated w/ Obsidian, but makes them easy to view @ same time as relevant Obsidian page w/o rearranging Windows or MacOS windows: Useful.
- [Pane Mode](https://github.com/Ellpeck/ObsidianCustomFrames?tab=readme-ov-file#-pane-mode): `Custom Frames:Open`
- [Markdown Mode](https://github.com/Ellpeck/ObsidianCustomFrames?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-markdown-mode): triple tick think to put in on a page
- Doesn't totally work on Mobile: a setting can turn it off there
- Both calendar and keep work perfectly w/ almost no setup.
- Makes [[2024-04-06#Google Calendar plugin]] unnecessary.
- [x] Pane icons, hotkeys?
	- **Icons**: briefcase: keep; calendar w/o number: google calendar; calendar w/ number: today's calendar
	- **Hotkeys**: `alt+k`: keep; `alt+c` google calendar

**Installed**

# Tasks plugin
From [here](here)

Collects tasks from all pages, I think, by looking for hierarchical tags.  Can put them in many pages, summarizable by project, topic, etc.  Powerful but bulky.  Worth it?

- kind of an annoying popup when you make a list TODO
	- [ ] disableable?
- you need to type a lot of stuff before the task is "entered"
- it's already possible to collect and query meeting notes todos. See [[2024-04-06#Meeting Notes Template Video]]
- One way to use it: [From Chaos to Control: GTD Hacks for Note-Taking Task Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWBmfoXnbFw)
	- suggests turning off auto-suggest for some reason
- [ ] Getting [[2024-04-06#Meeting Notes]] templates, daily notes links working first.
- [ ] ? interaction with [[Dailies/2025-02-20.md#Markdown table checkboxes Plugin |Markdown table checkboxes Plugin]] ?

**Disable, but maybe come back to this some time**

# Copilot plugin
From [here](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot)

LLM interface to Obsidian vault.  Connects to many models, including [[Morrison24ClaudeTopGPT4|Claude 3]] and Claude Haiku (soon).  Seems still beta (4/5/24) but could be worth trying.  Indexing seems fairly cheap.

# Share My Plugin LIst plugin
From [here]([GitHub - Benature/obsidian-share-my-plugin-list: Share the obsidian plugins that is using currently](https://github.com/Benature/obsidian-share-my-plugin-list)

Pastes a table or list of active / inactive plugins into current note.  I used it to give some info to the developer of 

# Symbols Prettifier plugin
From [here](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-symbols-prettifier)

Replaces symbols like "-->" and "<==>" with `-->`  and `<==>`.  But only, it seems, if you surround them with backticks.  Not clear from GitHub docs, so I didn't understand this, and [commented on a bug report](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-symbols-prettifier/issues/8#issuecomment-2041267107).  I'm also waiting to verify that backticks are supposed to be needed....
