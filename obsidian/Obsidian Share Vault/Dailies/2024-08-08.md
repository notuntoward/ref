# ERCOT vs. CAISO for research project: Meeting w/ Amir

- My points
	- I've been trying to avoid ERCOT
		- I've been trying to avoid ERCOT b/c of overlap w/ Amir
		- Mukunda says don't do ERCOT	
	- CAISO doesn't have the data to do good RTM scenarios
		- Byron and Jon have been saying it doesn't have the data, do ERCOT
		- basically DA forecasts and RTM prices for ST persistence
		- no "RTM" forecasts
		- seems to be missing bid curve info
		- Bids are also 1 hour resolution: too coarse relative to prices (5 min)
		- You'd need to do your own additional forecasts before doing stoch opt. scenarios
	- So: your OK to do ERCOT?
