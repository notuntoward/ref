# Zotero Integration Plugin
From [here](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration)

Working out the details...Back at settling on one that is:
- Has compact headings and callouts that don't get in the way
- handles tags reasonably from: obsidian, bibtex, zotero, (future) Evernote
- merges convenient quick notes made in Zotero with the obsidian notes I write for the entry
- [ ] [[2024-03-23#^68a237|Decide where to store Kindle and Zotero notes]]
- [ ] Integration with Obsidian is messy, could be improved
	- See [[lit/refwrangle/Zotero to Obsidian to RAG.md#Less tedious Zotero --> Obsidian Lit Note process |Less tedious Zotero --> Obsidian Lit Note process]]
- `Zotero Integration: Plugin Explorer` command is a nice way to test templates.  
	- 'prompt for select' brings up zotero chooser box, for you to pick some citation from
	- 'preview import format' (and select template) shows you what your import template will do.  
		- At least in source mode: not in preview or view mode.
		- cannot cut and paste the source mode rendering to an empty note in order to see the real thing  
## Zotero Integration Template

### attachment paths

In the nunchucks templates attachments are absolute on whatever machine you're running on 
- ==> won't work for MacOS and Windows.
- ==> need relative path
- environment path pointing to folder of pdfs
	- I don't know how to do that in nunchucks.
- [ ] put pdfs in obsidian vault
	- a simple wikilink can index pdf with no path spec at all (requires pdfs with unique citekeys, which is hopefully not a problem)
	- can put those pdfs anywhere in the obsidian vault w/ no path spec ==> can rearrange in the future w/o messing up lot notes
	- **PROBLEM**: OneDrive seems to be making two copies of all the pdfs, etc. in ref/zotero, even if I'm linking them.
	- [ ] **Solution**: point Zotero to the common pdf dir within the Obsidian vault.  That way, there's only one copy of the file in OneDrive.
#### link zotero pdf to obsidian vault

**Windows**

In an admin cmd window:
```
cd C:\Users\scott\OneDrive\share\ref\obsidian\Obsidian Share Vault\lit
mklink /D sources C:\Users\scott\ref\zotero
```

**MacOS**
```
do something linuxy
```


TOOO:
- [x] get html attachments
- [ ] new lit dirs
	- [ ] lit/notes
	- [ ] lit/sources
- [ ] put link to OS-absolute path to pdfs into obsidian fold (TEST this)
- [ ] use attachments.title to get pdf basename (use that for the wikilink)
- [ ] persistence
- [ ] relations are citekeys
- [ ] closer spaced callouts
- [x] fix authorname and date at to
- [ ] get rid if ~ in metadata author list
- [ ] get other attachments

## Zotero --> Obsidian note merging (no overwrite)
- Allow merging in new Zotero item changes while not overwriting obsidian notes
	- Mainly by using persist tags to prevent overwriting certain sections (and maybe allow metadata, etc. to be overwritten)
		- templates that persist successfully (so far):
			- [[zotTemp-PersistExample]]
			- [[zotTemp-LS-SDO]]
			- [[Zotero Template for Obsidian#Custom Zotero Template YouTube|Zotero Persistence Explained]]
	- [ ] **serious jankiness** in copying note for 1st time.  Only partial sometimes, and sometimes cannot change what is in the imported note, even after you've deleted the obsidian lit note and changed the next in the zotero note.  **WHY?**  Can I ever trust this?
	- [How do I prevent sections of my templates from being overwritten](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration/blob/main/docs/Templating.md#how-do-i-prevent-sections-of-my-templates-from-being-overwritten)
	- Example: [Obsidian zotero template for use with "obsidian-zotero-integration" plugin ¬∑ GitHub](https://gist.github.com/QWxleA/c7f08e8feded332736a6b376045d0fe4)
		- this one has \% code showing up when in edit mode (not read mode)
		- I didn't test much
		- template name: zotTemp-QWxlea-240307.md
	- [[2024-03-05#^3f568b|Phelan's template]] also preserves your notes.  She [says](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd):
	  
	  >You can then edit the document, and edits will be preserved. If you subsequently add more notes and annotations in the relevant PDF, they will be added in separate entries when you re-run ‚ÄúZotero Integration: Create Literature Note‚Äù.

# Underline Plugin

This adds several features.

![[2024-03-09-20240318095934863.webp|695]]

So far, I've mapped **ctrl+u** to <u>underline</u>. The link block/heading functions conflict with a refactor plugin (I think), which is probably a more complete way to do this, and I don't use centering that much

The only thing I don't like about this plugin is that adds html, and not plain markdown, but I [markdown doesn't have an underline](https://www.markdownguide.org/hacks/#:~:text=A%20couple%20of%20applications%20like,doesn't%20natively%20support%20underlining.), so it has to.

Note that I've mapped [[#Toggle Case Plugin|Toggle Case Plugin]] to `Alt + u`
# Toggle Case Plugin
From: [GitHub - MatthewAlner/obsidian...](https://github.com/MatthewAlner/obsidian-toggle-case)

Does `lowercase`¬†=>¬†`Title Case`¬†=>¬†`UPPERCASE` with each call.  I remember that I tried a couple related plugins and liked this one the best, some time in 2024.

I've mapped it to `Alt + u`, in the neighborhood of my GNU Emacs mappings: In emacs upper-case `Alt + u` does upper case; `Alt + c` does capitalization.

- [ ] @ consider plugin with separate upper case and capitalization functions, so I can match emacs, and not keep typing the wrong thing in Obsidian. This would be especially nice if some other plugin also advanced forward one word, like the Emacs uppercase and capitalize commands do.
- [ ] @ consider at least mapping to `Alt + c` instead, since that's what I always want to type
- [[2024-08-01#Change Case plugin|Change Case plugin]]: separate case commands, but no emacs-style word forward after case change

# Prominent Bookmarked Files Plugin

^ga8fkc

**Not reliable.**  The bookmark symbols appear only if you enable the CSS below (which makes an ugly and redundant symbol) and then disable it, leaving a reasonable default symbol of some kind.

**What it (should) do**:

[Prominent Bookmarked Files](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.05+All+Community+Expansions/Plugins/obsidian-prominent-starred-files): Puts a bookmark symbol next to bookmarked files in file explorer.  Helps find the tree in the forest.

> To customize the appearance of Bookmarked Files in Obsidian, you can modify the CSS class¬†`.prominent-decorated-file`. This class controls the layout and style of the Bookmarked Files pane in the Obsidian file explorer.

[Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) is [said](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/list-of-internally-supported-icons/36377?u=scotto) to show all the Obsidian icons.  I made this snippet *prominentBookmarkedFileSymbol.css*:

`.prominent-decorated-file::before {`
    `content: "üîñ"; /* Replace with your desired symbol (emoji or text) */`
    `color: #FF5733; /* Replace with your desired color */`
    `font-size: 16px; /* Adjust font size as needed */`
`}`

**However**, this only put a symbol to this spec next to the bookmark symbol Obsidian had already made in File Explorer -- it didn't replace it.  So, I deactivated this snippet, but left it in place, in case I find out something different.

# Better Link Editing

It's super annoying when a giant link opens as you move the cursor through the the line.  I guess, in the old days, you'd need to open it by ctrl+clicking it, so the current behavior was an [unpopular behavior change](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/ta9o1l/comment/i020za1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
- *Link editing*
	- *Middle click link edit*: If you middle click a link, an "edit link" menu item appears.  This allows you to more easily move the cursor to the right part of the right part of a link.  But a popup box that you let you quickly delete all of either the link text or the URL would be better, and this is the way it is on a lot of editors e.g. OneNOte
	- *cumbersome link editing workaround*: is to drag (link in highlighting) over the link.  Then you can at least move the cursor to the right place for editing.
- Traveling through text with links in it.
	- *But* the editing hacks don't deal with the terrible cursor movement through links.

# Blockier Plugin

[Blockier](https://github.com/blorbb/obsidian-blockier?tab=readme-ov-file) adds a couple nice things: a better "select all" (just the block) and simple way to switch between numbered and ordered lists:

- [Select Block](https://github.com/blorbb/obsidian-blockier?tab=readme-ov-file#select-block): With no modifications, Blockier maps `ctrl+a` to a smart kind of "select block," which, for lists, selects only the text and not the bullet or number.  I like that, but I want to reserve `ctrl+a` for the [[2024-06-18#Emacs Text Editor Plugin|Emacs Text Editor Plugin]] "move cursor to beginning of line."  So, I've mapped remapped Blockier's "select block" to  `ctrl+SHIFT+a`: obsidian's original "select whole page."  Note that this remapping won't work unless, in Blockier settings, you've unchecked to box for the `ctrl+a` behavior.
- [Block Edit](https://github.com/blorbb/obsidian-blockier?tab=readme-ov-file#block-edit): Can change the type of block by moving cursor to the start of a bullet, numbered list, or checkbox, and typing the symbol for the new block.  For example, you can change a numbered heading to a bulleted (unordered) list by typing `-`; to turn a unordered list to a numbered list, type e.g. `1.`.  I'm not sure what the checkbox thing does, but it works for bullets and numbers.  
	- Also see [[#Mapped to ctrl+l+* bullet toggles and window centers|Mapped to ctrl+l+* bullet toggles and window centers]]
- [Custom Checkboxes and Callouts](https://github.com/blorbb/obsidian-blockier?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-checkbox-and-callout-suggestions): The checkboxes didn't do anything, probably b/c I have only one checkbox type, currently; the callouts duplicated (I think) behavior already in Obsidian, so I disabled it in the plugin's settings.
# Mapped to ctrl+l+*: bullet toggles and window centers
- The Obsidian command *toggle bullet list* toggles between plain test block and a bullet. 
	- I've mapped this to `ctrl+alt+l`
	- It also *works on a region*.  Nice.
- Additionally, I've mapped `ctrl+l` to *cycle bullet checkbox*, which toggles between bullets and and checked/unchecked TODOs.  I do this more often than turn bullets to plain text.
- And, almost matching Emacs, I've mapped `ctrl+shift+l` to the [[2024-06-18#Emacs Text Editor Plugin|Emacs Text Editor Plugin]] *center window about cursor* (or something like that 
- **What would be really nice** is the emacs function that cycles all four things with the same command, but I can't find a command or plugin that does that.
- Also see [[Blockier]] for an easy typing way to change a block from bullet to numbered to text
# Heading Shifter Plugin
From: [Heading Shifter](https://github.com/k4a-l/obsidian-heading-shifter) 

Works like emacs demote/promote headlines for demoting and promoting the headline the cursor is on, or all headlines in selection. **Very Useful**

- I mapped **ctrl+SHIFT+rightArrow** to increase heading number; **ctrl+SHIFT+leftArrow** to decrease heading number
	- shifting to 0 turns headline into plain text (I enabled this in settings)
- [Setting](https://github.com/k4a-l/obsidian-heading-shifter?tab=readme-ov-file#settings) `Enable override tab behavior` setting makes `TAB` and `Shift + TAB` work like it does for bullets!
	- **works** well, does not seem to override [[2023-08-19#Outliner plugin|Outliner plugin]]'s use of `TAB` to indent/outdent?
	- documentation warns about this interfering with other plugins, and I thought that it messed up bullet indenting with outliner
		- But I was confused: see my **mistaken** [Feature request](https://github.com/k4a-l/obsidian-heading-shifter/issues/17).
	- Note that I also requested emacs-like `TAB` cycling folding: [[2023-08-19#Creases plugin]]
- Can **convert a line / bullet / numbered list into a heading** at a specified level 
	- e.g. commandz
	- I could just `Insert Heading at current level` and then shift it appropriately (only use one hotkey)
- [ ] My Bug Report:["Insert Heading at one level d...](https://github.com/k4a-l/obsidian-heading-shifter/issues/26)  Fixed

**Installed**
