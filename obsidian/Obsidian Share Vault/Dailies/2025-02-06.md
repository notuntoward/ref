# SQLSeal plugin
From: [GitHub - h-sphere/sql-seal: Qu...](https://github.com/h-sphere/sql-seal)

- Does Obsidian --> SQL --> Obsidian
- queries your obsidian files
- can read csv or json files, and make tables out of them in an obsidian note
- can autoupdate when ever that file changes, *I think*
- somehow use for [[lit/refwrangle/Zotero to Obsidian to RAG.md#Zotero <--> Obsidian Links |Zotero <--> Obsidian Links]]
- Documentation: [Obsidian SQLSeal](https://hypersphere.blog/sql-seal/)

**Try it**
# Smart Context Plugin
From:[GitHub - brianpetro/smart-context-obsidian](https://github.com/brianpetro/smart-context-obsidian)
- For copying selections of notes in bulk
- Used for creating AI context for queries
- By creator of [Dailies/2024-04-11.md#Smart Connections plugin ](<Dailies/2024-04-11.md#Smart Connections plugin >)

**Think about it**: seems like it could be useful, but for nothing that is specific right now.

# Atomizer Plugin
From: [GitHub - Binxly/Atomizer: An AI-Driven Obsidian plugin designed to turn lengthy text into insightful atomic notes. Perfect for turning source notes into ideas in a Zettelkasten workflow.](https://github.com/binxly/atomizer)

- AI to breaks a note into zettelkasten-style atomic notes
- Stores them in a separate folder of all atomic notes
- I tried it on an obsidian capture of the [Wikipedia Mutual Information Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) and wasn't overwhelmed
	- Not sure these are atomic in the zettelkasten way
	- Have titles like "Relationship to Entropy" which gives you no idea what the relationship is to
- No link from generated atomic notes back to original source notes, a dealbreaker
- uses OpenAI
- My feature request: [Atomic notes need link back to source note · Issue #2 · Binxly/Atomizer · GitHub](https://github.com/Binxly/Atomizer/issues/2)
- My feature request: [More informative titles · Issue #3 · Binxly/Atomizer · GitHub](https://github.com/Binxly/Atomizer/issues/3)

**Disabled**: I wouldn't use this without a link back to the original source, nor without meaningful atomic note titles.  But I'll only disable it so that I'll see any changes.
