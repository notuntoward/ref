# SQLSeal plugin
From: [GitHub - h-sphere/sql-seal: Qu...](https://github.com/h-sphere/sql-seal)

- Does Obsidian --> SQL --> Obsidian
- queries your obsidian files
- can read csv or json files, and make tables out of them in an obsidian note
- can autoupdate when ever that file changes, *I think*
- somehow use for [[lit/refwrangle/Zotero to Obsidian to RAG.md#Zotero <--> Obsidian Links |Zotero <--> Obsidian Links]]
- Documentation: [Obsidian SQLSeal](https://hypersphere.blog/sql-seal/)

**Try it**
# Smart Context Plugin
From:[GitHub - brianpetro/smart-context-obsidian](https://github.com/brianpetro/smart-context-obsidian)
- For copying selections of notes in bulk
- Used for creating AI context for queries
- By creator of [Dailies/2024-04-11.md#Smart Connections plugin ](<Dailies/2024-04-11.md#Smart Connections plugin >)

**Think about it**: seems like it could be useful, but for nothing that is specific right now.

# Atomizer Plugin
From: [GitHub - Binxly/Atomizer: An AI-Driven Obsidian plugin designed to turn lengthy text into insightful atomic notes. Perfect for turning source notes into ideas in a Zettelkasten workflow.](https://github.com/binxly/atomizer)

- AI to breaks a note into zettelkasten-style atomic notes

**Try it**.  Interesting!
