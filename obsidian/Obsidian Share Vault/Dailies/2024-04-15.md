# Multi-Properties plugin
From [here](https://github.com/fez-github/obsidian-multi-properties)

Can add, remove properties to the files in a folder, selection of notes, or search results.  If adding, and if the property already exists in a file, then by default, it will only add to the list of that property's values, rather than overwrite it.  Set `overwrite existing text` to True if you want to overwrite instead.

This is like Zotero's Manage Tags add-on, which is very useful.  So I'll try it here, too.

- [My bug report](https://github.com/fez-github/obsidian-multi-properties/issues/19) on property editing in search results
- [My feature request](https://github.com/fez-github/obsidian-multi-properties/issues/17), asking for an option to add properties to all open tabs.  I asked the same for the [[2024-04-08#Tag Wrangler plugin]] but the author said it was impossible.

**Installed**
