# SmartHelio Meeting
- they sell diagnostics for PV
- mostly large, moving to < 1 MW systems
- Jaspreet says our focus is larger, since we're going to own and operate (next is 1 GW)
- SmartHelio benefits
	- asset management
	- brings speed
	- typical pe
		- performance alertt
		- send maintenance guy to plant
		- diagnose with that guy online
	- MPPT level data isolates faults e.g. soiling, shading, inverter
		- both DC side and inverter
		- but not "all the way to the grid"
		- 49 kinds (I think) of faults they can classify
		- 35 factors looking at (I think)
- Laks Sampath (QCELLS)
	- pain points
		- solving DC side will solve 95% of his problems
		- simple to notice converter ineffficiency (I think he said)
		- problem is stuff that takes out strings
		- degradation is what he's worried about
		- solar is "death by a thousand cuts," all DC side
		- he doesn't care about alerts and alarms. He doesn't need them, they're binary, he can figure it out himself
			- 0.5 is what's hard
		- he's interested in economic analysis: what does it cost to have one string down?
			- so he can decide what to fix, I think he said.
			- not interested in "problem notifier" alert
		- big problem w/ so many alerts he gets, can't address them, too many
	- doesn't want multiple services, wants to "rely on this for everything"
- Shankaransh (SmartHelio)'s response
	- ID'd module degradation in France, and 7 of 8 (I think) diagnoses were correct
	- duration needed detect degradation
		- after 2 mo of data
		- b/f, it was after 1 year
		- I think he said their was a combo of ML and physics?
	- They get their data from a "monitoring company"
	- They use MPPT level data (max power point tracking)
	- calculates $/kWh losses, cumulatively
	- 2 compares: 
		- compare against best performing (input?) 
		- and what's expected from irradiance
	- doesn't currently have alert filtering
	- "steer away" from threshold game, will let you know the moment the problem starts
	- Govinda (SmartHelio) says: detected seasonality will reduce alert priority
	- Yash Shah (QCELLS) asks what you do w/o module level data
		- answer: algorithm adjusts to data level granulariety
		- e.g. say he get the sum of 20 strings: 
			- this will delay the fault detection
			- he didn't say it couldn't be detected
	- Jaspreet says inverter failure is worst
		- I think he means predict the failure, and how soon
		- answer: 
			- looks at model of inverter
			- says failure rates are different
			- inverter cabinet temperature data helps
			- this is done automatically
			- Govinda says there are also experts monitoring, to avoid disturbing client with false alarms
	- says your plant faults could be detected on first day of operation
	- wants a report of likely hit we'll take based on weather forecast
- Govinda (SmartHelio)
	- says platform is evolving, features, etc.
	- he'll share the reports
	- they have some function that predicts when an asset needs to be cleaned, and it will also tell you the impact
		- even tells you if its financially worth it if its a month where there will be a lot of rain anyway
	- says best thing is for them to install at a pilot plant, and then discuss results
		- this would speed up the process (of them buying from the, I think)
- My Questions (I didn't get to ask them, but some were answered anyway)
	- site startup
	- what design info do you need for this to work?
	- weather instrumentation required?  e.g. onsite irradiance meas?
		- uses site
		- clear sky models
		- takes data from 3rd party sources
		- does quality control on site data
	- handling module manufacturing differences vs. Faults (would mess up compare if didn't consider, says Laks)
		- look at manufacturer's tolerances (did he say that?)
		- lists possible reasons for discrepancy to test
		- bring your own weather data?
	- how do you get info about all the components?
		- Yash asked if he uses component data from other customers
		- answer: they do global learning and local learning, where they look at all inverter modules at all customers
			- they 
	- can we get a breakdown of what data you need for what quality, speed
# Custom Forecasting Pipelines Mtng
attendees: JonD, Amir, Nace, Emma, Haley, Purboday
- Emma
	- have structure of getting forecasts from S3
- Amir
	- LTRM solution is a one-off
	- wants to use solution for all BOP (?)
	- likes his args/predict/train(?) class idea
	- Byron and Garret have been working
- JonD
	- wants to do this for everything that can be forecasted
	- pull data from S3 location
	- same as for ERCOT and FOM
	- remove forecasting roadblocks
- Purboday
	- for FOM
		- have configs that define files
	- for load and PV use a different path
- Emma
	- market forecasting is simpler for load and PV (sim wise)
	- don't need to consider load and PV for now
	- need to extend what's there
### Conclusion
- go w/ Amir's S3 struct, args, pred, train objects
- S3 struct not in any DTO
- March (end of?) will be when it's implemented
- I said it was OK to not do an AEMO sim until then
