# Various Compliments plugin
- Maybe useful if you want to make a lot of links fast, otherwise, probably annoying
- What it does
	- like programming autocomplete but with words
	- As you type, it makes a popup of all the notes that fuzzy-match the word you are in the middle of typing.
	- click on one of them and it will turn your word into a link to that note
	- handles aliases too.

# Local Images Plus plugin
- Useful: when you paste in chunks of a web page, this plugin downloads the images and stores them locally.
- I've set it up to copy Obsidian global attachments setting, to it goes into ./attachments folder.
- Problems
	- supposed to remove orphaned attachments but this does not seem to work
	- saved images filenames are pure hashes.  But something else has been making attachment filenames from the name of the note it's attached to.  This could be right for a long time, so I think that's preferable, but I don't know how to set this up.
