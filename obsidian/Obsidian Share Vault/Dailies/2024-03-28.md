### Links plugin
From [here](https://github.com/mii-key/obsidian-links)
Tons of useful link functions.  I've sprinkled many of them in the [[#General Link Commands from Viable Plugins|General Link Commands from Viable Plugins]] table above

- Compare with
	- [Transporter Plugin](2024-03-23.md#Text%20Transporter%20Plugin)
	- [[#Insert Heading Link plugin|Insert Heading Link Plugin]]
- [x] Can this solve the "link to daily notes problem?"  
	- Can it autocomplete/search for a headline inside another note that it has already completed? 
	- [x] *Nope*
- last update was 2 days ago (3/28/24)
- Many useful functions.  
	- link changing functions 
		- use when have cursored into a link and it blows up to long markdown
		- on context menu and command pallet when cursor in link.  Hot keys make them accessible always.
		- [Edit link text](https://github.com/mii-key/obsidian-links?tab=readme-ov-file#edit-link-text)
		- [Edit link destination](https://github.com/mii-key/obsidian-links?tab=readme-ov-file#edit-link-text)
		- and a bunch of other link editing commands
	- Also See Links plugin entries in [[#General Link Commands from Viable Plugins|General Link Commands from Viable Plugins]]
- [ ] figure out best way to use link changing commands
- [[2024-04-17#Auto Link Title plugin|Auto Link Title plugin]] does something very similar to this plugin's `Create link from clipboard` command, although Links's command selects whole word automatically: no need to select it yourself.,
	- [x] I've mapped `create link from keyboard`: [[2024-06-18#My Emacs Hotkeys|My Emacs Hotkeys]].
- My Feature requests for Links Plugin
	- [x] [My feature request](https://github.com/mii-key/obsidian-links/issues/25#issuecomment-2097092356) for a Copy Link DWIM command:  implemented
	- [x] [[2024-05-19#Obsidian Links plugin feature request inhibit link expansion]]:author says he can't do it
	- [ ] [[2024-05-19#Obsidian Links plugin feature request copy link to search result]]
	- [x] [[2024-05-19#Obsidian Links plugin feature request Markdown link for Copy link to heading]]: implemented 
	- [x] Make selection link description: [Feature Request: Set link desc...](https://github.com/mii-key/obsidian-links/issues/43)
	- [x] *I didn't ask*: Short Links config changed, and started working after I adjusted it.
		- ask author to implement the broken [[#Short Links plugin]] other-note, subheading link shortener.'
			- he does make wikilink title when I click on a header
			- the ask is that he intercepts the stock `\[\[##` obsidian action to also insert the wikilink title there.
	- [ ] Feature Request: [rename-element...](https://github.com/mii-key/obsidian-links/issues/52)

**Very useful:** **Install**
### Insert Heading Link plugin
From [here](https://github.com/Signynt/insert-heading-link)

If you type \[\[\#, and then a number of \#'s, you can search for headings in the current or other notes.  E.g.  
- \[\[\# searches for any heading in your current doc
- \[\[\#\# searches for any heading in other docs
- and adds the link when you select one
- Solves problem of links to daily notes
	- their date names don't help you search for the heading
	- Answer: **Yes**: the command is `Add Heading Link`
- would be nice if it could search bullets too, but as is...
	- [x] [My Feature Request](https://github.com/Signynt/insert-heading-link/issues/1#issue-2214326837)
	- last update was 2 years ago (3/28/24) so I'm not hopeful

**Uninstalled**: useful but the more versatile [[#Links plugin|Links plugin]] did the same thing

### Short Links plugin
From [here](https://github.com/scottwillmoore/obsidian-short-links)

Automatically and sensibly shortens the display of links like this: `[](PageName#HeaderName)` & others
- shortens headers & block links
- option to not show link-type-defining icon also removes external link icons (good)
	- [x] I used that option, and turned off link icon: elegance before destination certainty
- works both in live preview and view
- [[#Links plugin]] makes manual fixing easier w/ set_link_text, etc. makes manual fixing easier w/ set_link_text, etc.
- This used to work well, but now it puts a `#` in front of any link to a heading
	- My bug report: [Show hash option doesn&#39;t work on links to headings · Issue #23 · scottwillmoore/obsidian-short-links · GitHub](https://github.com/scottwillmoore/obsidian-short-links/issues/23)
- The [[Dailies/2025-02-20.md#Link Headers Directly Plugin |Link Headers Directly Plugin]] Could be another way, but doesn't work in live preview mode
- [ ] ? Could this be implemented in the [[#Links Plugin]]?

**Disabled** until the `#` bug is fixed

### Open Link With plugin
From [here](https://github.com/MamoruDS/obsidian-open-link-with)

Gives a choice menu for opening an external file.  Could be a good way to open pdfs w/ either Drawboard or PDF Xchange.  [Custmomization](https://github.com/MamoruDS/obsidian-open-link-with?tab=readme-ov-file#customization) for a secondary, OS-specific handler, selectable with a modifier key.  Multiple options for modifier.  Uses "system default" if no modifier, doesn't have to be hardcoded, so inherently cross-platform?

- click opens system default browser (instead of obsidian) with no configuration
- [ ] **TODO**: complicated config for cmdline starting of Windows Store Apps like Drawboard
- [ ] **TODO** [2024-03-16](2024-03-16.md#PDF++) pdf opening conflicts?

**Installed** just for the default browser; deal w/ potential PDF++ probs; config for drawboard

### @ Symbol Linking plugin
From [here](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-at-symbol-linking)

@ starts a link dialog, which brings up a note selection.  Selection could be narrowed to a folder.  Useful for specifically linking to literature notes, for example?

Try it: [@Baru23predMaintLife3ways](../lit/Baru23predMaintLife3ways.md)

**Leave it installed**: Good for focusing on `lit` dir, for example.  Don't need it now, but maybe w/ pandoc or something?
## Zotero DB Link Plugins

### Topic Linking plugin
From [here](https://github.com/liammagee/obsidian-topic-linking)

Several functions for mass convert of files, including but not limited to Zotero DB.  Something in there could be good.  Recommends [#Bibnotes plugin](#Bibnotes%20plugin) for a subset of the tasks it does.
### Bibnotes plugin
From [here](https://github.com/stefanopagliari/bibnotes)

Another mass move of Zotero notes to obsidian.  Recommended by [#Topic Linking plugin](#Topic%20Linking%20plugin).  Not yet official, so *complicated custom install*.

### [[2024-02-25#ZotLit plugin]]: also does DB download but is currently broken

## Link Exploration plugins
### Link Tree plugin
From [here](https://github.com/joshuatazrein/obsidian-link-tree)

Makes a clickable side pane showing forward and backlinks of the current document. It's *compact* and more quickly *scannable* than standard `Open Local Graph` but not as easy to navigate.

- if click on the `...` 
	- can see where a forward link goes
	- but not the place in the current doc that made the link (which I'm interested in)
		- [ ] Make a feature request?
	- can also follow linkee links too (dark dot shows when they have deeper links)
	- can click on the linkee to open it
- can't see the place in the doc that made the link
- links are only across notes, not links internal to notes
- Comparable to [#2Hop Links Plus plugin](#2Hop%20Links%20Plus%20plugin)?
- I think I might like the standard `Open Local Graph` better

**Try it for a while** see if I use it
## Holding pen links

Not rejected,  might want to look at them again someday
### Link Converter plugin
From: [here](https://github.com/ozntel/obsidian-link-converter)

Does 4 link conversions.  

- Vault: Links to Wiki
- Vault: Links to Markdown
- Active File: Links to Wiki
- Active File: Links to Markdown
- Says modified links can be converted to relative, but *I didn't get this to work* for a absolute (relative to OK) link

Can do on whole vault or just current note.  Maybe useful for when I'm exporting to word or something?  I don't know...  In any case, the [#Links plugin](#Links%20plugin) seems to do all of this and more. 

Link Converter is also a bit dangerous, as it can do bulk conversions.

So **Don't Install** for now

### Better File Links plugin (a.k.a. obsidian-file-link)
From: [here](https://github.com/marcjulianschwarz/obsidian-file-link)

A better picker for linking external files internal to obsidian.  Don't have to hunt around for links in obsidian explorer.  Can select multiple files, get their links in one call.

- See also [#Link Range plugin](#Link%20Range%20plugin), which can make links to multiple heading (but required clumsy manual link editing)
- Could use for this is probably digging out links to files in the `attachments` folders.
	- **Problem with that** is that links are absolute: [[<file:///C:\Users\scott\OneDrive\share\ref\obsidian\Obsidian Share Vault\dailies\attachments\2023-10-19-20231019204145508.webp>|2023-10-19-20231019204145508]]
	- So not cross-platform
	- Seems like it be possible to convert to relative w/ [#Link Converter plugin](#Link%20Converter%20plugin) but I didn't get that that to work
	- 
**Not installed** but could tinker more with this later when I really need its functions

**Installed**

### Multiple Notes Outline plugin
From [here](https://github.com/iiz00/obsidian-multiple-notes-outline)

From the creator of [[2023-11-18#Daily Notes Outline plugin]], but is about links and outline of current note.  Given the author, this might be good.
- what you display is very configurable
- [ ] compare w/ [#Link Tree plugin](#Link%20Tree%20plugin),  [#2Hop Links Plus plugin](#2Hop%20Links%20Plus%20plugin), and [2024-03-23](2024-03-23.md#Outline%20core%20plugin)
- [ ] File view is a fancier [2024-03-23](2024-03-23.md#Outline%20core%20plugin) except you can't move headlines, or collapse them

I don't understand what the file view does, even how to select it

**Disable for Now**
### Transcription plugin
From [here](https://github.com/djmango/obsidian-transcription)

Transcribes audio or video files into and Obsidian page (I think).  Uses OpenAI stuff.
### Spotify Link plugin
From [here](https://github.com/studiowebux/obsidian-spotify-link?tab=readme-ov-file)

Inserts a link to the song currently playing on spotify.  Interesting, and I might use it once in a while.

The setup instructions are step-by-step: [Step-by-step Illustrations | Obsidian Plugins Docs](https://studiowebux.github.io/obsidian-plugins-docs/docs/spotify-link/steps).  Afterwards
- I was able to connect to Spotify (according to obsidian icon color and "Spotify connected" text in LRS of obsidian window).
- I used the song_name template
- Fixed! [My Bug Report](https://github.com/studiowebux/obsidian-spotify-link/issues/5#issue-2214366198)
- Quote links chew up a lot of space
	- My feature request: [Compact links · Issue #9](https://github.com/studiowebux/obsidian-spotify-link/issues/9)
### Spotify Plugin Tests

**The result when I used a table template for podcasts**
*(Template is ignored, and I get a giant text blob of a link text.)*

### 2Hop Links Plus plugin
From [here](https://github.com/L7Cy/obsidian-2hop-links-plus?tab=readme-ov-file)

Shows you what links to a note and what links to that note, in a graph form.  Kindof already doable with the built-in page graph display, but card display of linked-to pages could be interesting b/c you don't need to click around

- [ ] But can you get rid of the card easily? 
- [ ] Comparable to [#Link Tree plugin](#Link%20Tree%20plugin)?
- couldn't figure out how to start it, and warning about package's low maintenance

**Uinstalled**

### Quoth plugin
From [here](https://github.com/erykwalder/quoth/commits/main/)

An alternative and parallel option to standard obsidian block embeds.  Slightly less obtrusive.  A little closer to my emacs dedicated tags hack.  Pretty <u>likely to break.</u> ^shrksg

Bad that it's an embed, but that it's the selection.  I haven't yet found a block copier that simply fills the link text with the block contents.  Maybe this is as good as it gets? ^lfaoi3

See what the author's response to <span style="color:#ffc000">feature requests</span> is.  Last update was 5 months old, on 3/25/24. ^nt0bm0

This kinda worked but I decided to limit the number of plugins buy using a similar but better function in the [[#Links plugin|Links plugin]]

- Somewhat close to my emacs dedicated tags: ^c0pif3
	- If select text and hit `Ctrl + shift + '`, you copy the embed ^cdo49k
	- It will appear where you paste it
	- but *can't* just put your cursor on a headline and copy: must select something
		- [ ] <span style="color:#ffc000">Feature request?</span>
- Embed appearance
	- Yes, the fonts match, unlike the standard obsidian beds, but the font size is smaller
	- more indent than obsidian embed but doesn't follow bullet indent
	- can't get rid of the blue line
		- [ ] <span style="color:#ffc000">Feature request?</span>
	- good symbols on RHS of embed: show code, copy contents, go to link
		- I like them
		- [2024-03-23](2024-03-23.md#Text%20Transporter%20Plugin) has a link for each line, is more robust to edits
- <u>Likely to break</u>
	- **Quoth could get out of date.  From Quoth settings**
	- ![829](2024-03-26-20240326111125208.webp)
	- [Fragile to editing of source](https://github.com/erykwalder/quoth/issues/20)
		- [x] I [suggested](https://github.com/erykwalder/quoth/issues/20#issuecomment-2021232309) obsidian's block IDs

- [ ] See alternatives in [](.md#Plugin%20Survey,%20mostly%20links%20but%20not%20all)

**Conclusion**: It could be brittle, and doesn't offer more than other plugins ([2024-03-23](2024-03-23.md#Text%20Transporter%20Plugin) offers most in robust block embedding commands).  

**Uninstall**

##### Quoth embed test

**Selected a bullet**

```quoth
path: [](2024-03-26.md#Make%20md%20plugin)
ranges: "- adds a `" to "a headline"
```

**Selected a whole heading**

- here's some text I typed so I can compare fonts.
	- an indent to see if it matches
		- another deeper indent.  Nope.
```quoth
path: [](2024-03-26.md#Make%20md%20plugin)
ranges: "# Make.md " to " run that."
```

### Copy Block Link plugin
From [here](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-copy-block-link)

This worked well, but I limited the number of plugins buy using a similar but better function in the [[#Links plugin|Links plugin]]

Similar to?
- [#Carry Forward plugin](#Carry%20Forward%20plugin)
- [Text Transporter](2024-03-23.md#Text%20Transporter%20Plugin)
- [#Quoth plugin](#Quoth%20plugin)


*Summary*
- copy link to block just copies ref, not text.  Link looks like reI want text in the link
- copy block embed works fine.  Similar to others

**Uninstalled.** Other options equivalent or better
#### Copy Block Link plugin tests

**Copy link to block**
[Zotero Template for Obsidian](Zotero%20Template%20for%20Obsidian.md#^921j8c)

**Copy Block Embed**
![](Zotero%20Template%20for%20Obsidian.md#^eqmh1c)
### Carry Forward plugin
From [here](https://github.com/jglev/obsidian-carry-forward)

Similar to [#Copy Block Link plugin](#Copy%20Block%20Link%20plugin) & friends but more functions?

[Four commands](https://github.com/jglev/obsidian-carry-forward?tab=readme-ov-file#screenshots-and-usage)
1. Carry Forward: Copy selection with each line linked to its copied source
2. Carry Forward: Copy selection with first line linked to its copied source
3. Carry Forward: Copy link to line
4. Carry Forward: Copy embed link to line

*Middling OK*
- [#Carry Forward plugin tests](#Carry%20Forward%20plugin%20tests) are adequate, but not amazing
- last update about a year ago, on 3/28/24
- I tried to delete `Carry Forward: Copy link to line` template, so whole line copied into link text (was `(see {{LINK}})`.  However, the plugin immediately filled it back in, so this did noting
	- [ ] <span style="color:#ffc000">Bug report?</span>

**Disable for the moment*, consider the alternatives.
#### Carry Forward plugin tests

**Carry Forward: Copy selection with each line linked to its copied source**
- hashTags: zotero tags (see [Zotero Template for Obsidian](Zotero%20Template%20for%20Obsidian.md#^ltkm7r))
- allTags: the other tags (from original bibtex?) (see [Zotero Template for Obsidian](Zotero%20Template%20for%20Obsidian.md#^co3mdc))

**Carry Forward: Copy selection with first line linked to its copied source**
- allTags: the other tags (from original bibtex?) (see [Zotero Template for Obsidian](Zotero%20Template%20for%20Obsidian.md#^co3mdc))
```timestamp 
 07:54
 ```
- original annotations are 'the original ones' ^kr39qg
- formatted annotations have highlight names, etc. ^72ri80

**Carry Forward: Copy link to line**

*Default template*
(see [Zotero Template for Obsidian](Zotero%20Template%20for%20Obsidian.md#^co3mdc))

*Blank template*
`copied nothing: was blank when I pasted the result`

**Carry Forward: Copy embed link to line**

### Link With Alias plugin
From [here](https://github.com/pvojtechovsky/obsidian-link-with-alias)

Creates a link alias w/ an editable name and leaves it in the text

- [ ] what happens if you click on this link?
- [ ] what is the alias an alias to?
- [ ] Is this like my emacs dedicated links?
- [ ] I don't know what this does, but [2024-03-23](2024-03-23.md#Text%20Transporter%20Plugin) already does alias links, so don't need it for sure.

**Not Installed**

### Bulk open selected links plugin
From [here](https://github.com/autohub7/obsidian-open-selected-links)

Opens links in selected range in a bunch of tabs, I think.  Could then waterfall them or whatever that obsidian thing is.  I can imagine that this would be useful.  

**Not installed**  I don't have a use case for this right now.  Maybe some day.
### Tabout plugin
From [here](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-tabout)

Tab to get out of the middle of long links you have accidentally cursored into.  
- By default also tabs out of `*`, `**`, \' , and `(, {`.  Can be changed.

Sounds useful.  But it [had a bug and didn't work](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-tabout/issues/15#issuecomment-2026276672). and will watch the updates to see if it's ever fixed. I'm not hopeful, as the last update was 2 years ago (as of 3/28/24).

**I disabled it**

### Link Range plugin
From [here](https://github.com/rmellmer/obsidian-link-range)

- Lets you link to a *range* of links (to headlines, I think).  A very special case, but in fact, I was just looking to do this.
- but you have to maually-edit the link to do this.  I'm probably not going to ever do that
- could tell that youtube bible guy about this
- For multi file links: [#Better File Links plugin (a.k.a. obsidian-file-link)](#Better%20File%20Links%20plugin%20(a.k.a.%20obsidian-file-link))

Interesting, but **uninstall**

### Link Headers Directly plugin
From [here](https://github.com/Signynt/link-headers-directly)

A link shortener like [#Short Links plugin](#Short%20Links%20plugin), which has more functions.  Last update was 3 years ago (3/28/24).  
**Don't Install**
