# Instant Above Divider Plugin
From: [GitHub - sedationh/obsidian-in...](https://github.com/sedationh/obsidian-instant-above-divider)

Adds a command to put a divider line somewhere around a heading, something it turns out I didn't want to do.

Instead, with stock obsidian, I can instantly insert a divider line wherever I want with `---<Enter>` at the beginning of the current line.

**Uninstalled**: didn't use, stock Obsidian was fine.
