# Heading fonts and sizes
These use up too much space, and are not adjustable in the Gitsidian theme, which is my favorite so far.

## Plain CSS Snipppets
So CSS.  I messed around with:

~/OneDrive/share/ref/obsidian/Obsidian Share Vault/.obsidian/snippets/heading_fonts.css

And this does have an effect.  I've disabled it for now and will come back to it.

Obsidian's CSS doc: [CSS snippets - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets)

## Style Settings Plugin
From: [obsidian-style-settings: A dynamic user interface for adjusting theme, plugin, and snippet CSS variables](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings?tab=readme-ov-file)

I already had this installed, for some reason, **but I don't understand it**. 

- Plugin programmers can apparently use it to add their settings to the settings list the style settings plugin makes.
- Some themes do this too.
- Somehow, you're also [supposed to](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings?tab=readme-ov-file#obsidian-style-settings-plugin) be able to change all the fonts, etc., by using [this CSS snippet](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings/blob/main/obsidian-default-theme.css).
	- I put it in: 
	  ~/OneDrive/share/ref/obsidian/Obsidian Share Vault/.obsidian/snippets/style_settings_plugin.css
	- But this had no effect, either on the page directly, or in what settings the Style Settings Plugin displays.
	- Weird that everything in that CSS snippet was commented out.  Seems like the SSP scans it?
