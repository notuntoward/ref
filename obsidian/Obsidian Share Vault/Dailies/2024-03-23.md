# Obsidian Kindle Plugin
From: [GitHub - hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin: Sync your Kindle notes and highlights directly into your Obsidian vault](https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin)

**Almost works !**

- downloads all your highlights in all your kindle books at once
- puts them in a folder, separate .md notes for each book
- book notes contain a copy of what you highlighted, for each highlight
- [ ] also has a link to the highlight: opens Kindle (on my PC) and goes to the highlight!
	- **Bummer**: gets stuck on the page of the last highlight you clicked on
	- *Workaround*: 
		- click on a highlight link from some other book.  
		- Then go back to the Obsidian page of the book you're actually interested in
		- Click on the link of the highlight you're actually interested in.
	- [ ] When I'm serious about using it, try to **debug it**.
- Downloads ("syncs") only when you run Obsidian command *Kindle Highlights: Sync Highlights* ?
	- [docs](https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#features) say that it  does "**Continuous, automatic syncing** — One button press to sync your highlights using your Amazon account via [Amazon's Kindle Reader](https://read.amazon.com/notebook)."
	- Test: highlight something and see if it automatically updates Obsidian: it doesn't
- Can source either from Amazon account or Kindle device 
	- I from device, you can get non-AMZ pdfs and books, I think
	- Amazon account seems to work fine
- last commit was about a year ago (from today: 3/23/2024)
- [ ] **Decide where to store Kindle and Zotero notes** ^68a237

# Backlinks and easier Block Links

I know of two ways to create a link to a non-headline block: 

1. **Cursor on Link Target**: Run *Advanced URI: copy URI for current block*
2. **Cursor on place where link will be put**: use *\[\[page#^blocktext]]* notation

The <u>first option</u> is fairly simple.  It has nearly the ease of use of my Emacs dedicated targets hack.  But making the link text is a little fussy.  It's not too bad to type link text in the destination doc, highlight it, and paste the URI, although better would be nice if it automatically copied the block text at the destination, or whatever text is selected, in the spirit of Emacs.  However, it <u>doesn't create a backlink on the source page</u>.

The <u>2nd option</u> is difficult and tedious, but it does produce a backlink on the linked-to page.

- [ ] **TODO**: submit a bug report for block URI's not making backlinks
- [ ] **TODO**: submit a feature request for *\[\[page#]]* notation to not distinguish between headlines and blocks, eliminating the need for *\[\[page#^blocktext]]* notation: Put headlines on top of completion options, then bullets, the numbered lists, and the plain text blocks: narrow selection by search with the same ordering priority.
- [ ] **TODO**: submit a feature request for the full functionality of my Emacs dedicated target hack.
- [ ] **TODO**: feature request to always treat bullets and numbered lists as headlines?  So folding is easier?  How would that work?  Anyway, refactoring outlines sux on Obsidian

Related: [[2024-03-09#Better Link Editing]]

# Better outline refactoring

## My Conclusions 

Source: [[RefactoringHotKeys.xlsx]].  Table below is copied from there.

### Moving
- Bullets
	- `Ctrl + SHIFT + up/down` are fine for moving *bullets* up and down at same level
		- moves hierarchies, too, if present
		- if move above parent, then keep at original level, which is OK
	- <u>Nothing moves numbered lists</u>, hierarchical or not.  Just cut & paste.
	- [ ] <u>Doesn't work on headings</u>.  <span style="color:#ffc000">Feature request?</span>
- Headings
	- <span style="color:#ffc000">nothing?</span>
### Indenting
- Bullets
	- `TAB and SHIFT + TAB` indent/outdent bullets and numbered lists
- Headings
	- [ ] `Ctrl + SHIFT + left/right`: I mapped to indenting *headlines* (make more sense <u>would make sense</u> for indenting *bullets*?.  <span style="color:#ffc000">Change This Mapping?</span>
### Folding
- Bullets
	- `Ctrl + Up/Down` fold and unfold lists (ordered and unordered)
- Headings
	- `click heading symbol` toggles individual heading's fold state
	- For <u>all headings</u>
	  Very Confusing, mostly obsolete (see [[2023-08-19#Creases|Creases]]), could use for whole doc init
		- [[#^0a7524|Fold More]] for all headings, except is incremental `decrease heading fold level`
		- [[#^bafd55|Fold Less]] for all headings, except is incremental `increase heading fold level`
		- stops folding ("more" or "decrease") when reaches level of your cursor ???
	- [x] [My request for a header toggle](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/issues/857#issuecomment-2016893862)
	- [x] [A forum request for a header toggle](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/toggle-hotkeys/3559/10?u=scotto)
- Both headings and lists
	- `Ctrl + Alt + Up`: Fold all headings and lists
		- `Ctrl + Alt + Down`: Unfold all headings and lists
	- For the <u>heading or list you're on</u> (no toggle, but [[2023-08-19#Creases|Creases]] are related)
		- [ ] Fold More (totally folds) ^0a7524
		- [ ] Fold Less (totally unfolds <span style="color:#ffc000">key conflict</span>) ^bafd55
- Zooming (not folding or unfolding) bullets or headings![[#Zoom Plugin Commands|Zoom Plugin Commands]]
- `Codeblock Customizer: Fold/Unfold all codeblocks`: And more. I haven't mapped them.
#### H41
##### H51
stuff
##### H52
stuff
#### H42

### Forward/Back
#### Within page ("navigate cursor" history plugin)
- `ctrl + shift + -`: back
- `ctrl + shift + +: `forward
##### H51
jamie
##### H52
stuff
#### Across pages ("navigate")
- `arrows` in upper left pane corner
- hotkeys
	- ` + left: `back
	- `alt + right`: forward
	- [ ] redundant: <span style="color:#ffc000">Use for indent or something?</span>
		- `ctrl + alt + left: `back
		- `ctrl + alt + right: `forward

### Refactoring / Refiling / Transclusion

Also see: [[2024-06-18#My Emacs Hotkeys]]
#### What I'd like:
- click on a block/heading/selection, "copy" this chunk somehow, and do one of several things at a location in this page or some other page
	- copy chunk to new location
	- move chunk to new location
	- move chunk to new location, leave a link to it at original location
	- move chunk to new location, leave an embed to it at original location
	- The new location is either specified by cursor, or by typing in a page name.
		- if that page doesn't exist, create it and do the right thing there
		- else append the right thing to the end of that page
	- I believe that [logseq](https://logseq.com/) had something like this, and emacs org-refile-tree, somewhat
#### What's doable now

- `![[block]]]` does transclusion ("embedding") on any block and what's under it.
- `click on RHS` of embed square to go to the source.
- `ctrl + click on RHS` of embed square opens the embed source in a new pane.  
	- To go "back," just go there.
	- Or, you can edit in the source location and, in the previous page, see what it looks like in the embed.
- `cut-n-paste.  
- `copy-link-to-element` from [[2024-03-28#Links plugin|Links plugin]] 
## Refactoring and Structure Navigating Plugins

### Outline core plugin

A barebones but usable outline viewing side-pane.

- not about lists; only headlines ^3jml
- I think it's better than [[#Quiet Outline Plugin|Quiet Outline Plugin]]
- Is different than [[2023-08-19#Outliner plugin|Outliner plugin]], which focuses more on lists ^b58b

**Installed**

### [[2024-03-09#Heading Shifter Plugin|Heading Shifter Plugin]]
Indents/outdents headlines. <u>Many</u> commands.  These defaults are useful:
![[2024-03-23-20240324105500148.webp]]
But I've changed them so that `TAB` and `SHIFT + TAB` change the heading levels, so has the same behavior as lists (due tor [[#Outliner Plugin|Outliner Plugin]] or is this just default Obssidian behavior?)

I also like the **assign header...** commands, because when they convert bullets, the get rid of the bullet symbols, unlike the stock `set as heading...` commands

- My feature request: [Fix bullet indentation after apply header command · Issue #33 · k4a-l/obsidian-heading-shifter · GitHub](https://github.com/k4a-l/obsidian-heading-shifter/issues/33)

**Installed**.  Very useful
### Zoom Plugin
From: [GitHub - vslinko/obsidian-zoom](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-zoom)

It's something like emacs M-x org-tree-to-indirect-buffer, except it doesn't make a new buffer, and leaves a breadcrumb trail to unzoom.  But it's not maintained: last update was about a year ago (from Mar 2024).
- Not to be confused with [[Dailies/2025-02-28.md#Size Zoom Plugins |Size Zoom Plugins]]
- It's missing step-by-step zoom/unzoom: [comment on the GitHub](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-zoom/issues/92#issuecomment-2016661334).
#### Zoom Plugin Commands
- `Ctrl + .` hides all but the bullet/ordered list / header the cursor is on, plus whatever's below it, hierarchically
- `Ctrl + SHIFT + .` totally unfolds *everything*.  
	- Better would be to undo just the last operation
	- I [commented on this on the GitHub page](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-zoom/issues/92#issuecomment-2016661334).
- `click on bullet: `hides everything but the bullet and its children (does nothing on the number of a numbered list)
- `click on bread crumb: `selectively unhide the hierarchy
- Simpler but not alternative [[2025-02-27#Focus and Highlight Plugin]]

**Disabled** since it's not maintained, and since it's missing step-by-step zooom/unzoom.  But leave installed, so if its ever updated, I'll hear about it.
### Quiet Outline Plugin
- [[#Gemini's answer|recommended by Gemini]]
- was initially buggy but but better on 7/2024
	- but still, clicking somewhere in the note, doesn't update the marker in the quiet outline display, showing which outline you're under.  Looks like it's supposed to do that -- the standard [[#Outline core plugin|Outline core plugin]] does it.
- I also don't so far see any other improvement.

**Disabled**: maybe some future update will fix the bugs, make it interesting? 
## My question to Gemini and Copilot:

> I like how emacs org mode can easily move outlines and their sub-outlines around in a document. The org-refile command is one of the many that are useful. In obsidian, it's very difficult to move groups of headlines or hierarchical bullets and numbered lists. Are there obsidian tricks or plugins that improve this?
### Copilot's answer

> Yes, there are plugins in Obsidian that can help with moving outlines and their sub-outlines around in a document. [One such plugin is the **Outliner**](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner)[1](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner).
> 
> [Here are some of its features](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner)[1](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner):
> 
> -  **Move lists and sublists**: You can move lists with children wherever you want without breaking the structure. The hotkeys for moving lists and sublists up and down are `Ctrl Shift ↑` and `Ctrl Shift ↓` respectively on Windows/Linux, and `Command Shift ↑` and `Command Shift ↓` respectively on MacOS.
> - **Indent and Outdent the list and sublists**: You can indent and outdent the list and sublists using `Tab` and `Shift Tab` respectively.
> - **Fold and unfold your lists**: You can fold and unfold your lists using `Ctrl ↑` and `Ctrl ↓` respectively on Windows/Linux, and `Command ↑` and `Command ↓` respectively on MacOS.

### Gemini's answer

> You're right, Obsidian's core functionality for outline manipulation can feel clunky compared to Emacs' org-mode. However, there are definitely ways to improve this! Here's a breakdown of options:
> 
> **Core Obsidian Features:**
> 
> - **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Built-in keyboard shortcuts like `Cmd + Shift + Up/Down` allow you to move entire sections of text with headings one position at a time.
> 
> **Plugins:**
> 
> - **Obsidian Outline (Core Plugin):** While this plugin shows the outline structure, it doesn't directly facilitate moving sections. However, understanding the visual representation can help you plan your reorganization.[
](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/pongamia-trees-grow-where-citrus-once-flourished-offering-renewable-energy-and-plant-based-protein/)> - [[#Quiet Outline Plugin|Quiet Outline Plugin]]: This community plugin offers a dedicated outline view where you can drag and drop headlines and their sub-outlines to easily rearrange your document.
> 
> **Alternative Techniques:**
> 
> - **Transclusion Links:** While not strictly for moving outlines, you can create transclusion links to specific sections within your vault. This allows you to "include" that section in another note, essentially replicating the content without physically moving it.
> 
> By combining these methods, you can achieve a more fluid outlining experience in Obsidian. Try out the [[#Quiet Outline Plugin|Quiet Outline Plugin]] for a drag-and-drop approach similar to org-mode's `org-refile` (that plugin wasn't great on 7/2024).

**These seem to be about moving lists, bullets or numbered.  How about headings?**

> You're absolutely right, some of the previous suggestions were more focused on generic outlines rather than specifically moving headings. Here are some options specifically geared towards moving headings in Obsidian:
> 
> **Built-in Functionality:**
> 
> - **Folding and Dragging:** While not the most elegant solution, you can leverage folding with dragging.
>     1. Enable "Fold Headings" in Settings > Core > Editor.
>     2. Fold the section containing the heading you want to move.
>     3. Click and drag the folded line to the new desired location within the editor pane. This will move the entire folded section (heading and its content).
> 
> **Plugins:**
> 
> - [[#Quiet Outline Plugin|Quiet Outline Plugin]]: As mentioned earlier, this plugin offers a dedicated outline view where you can drag and drop **headings**, not just lists. This provides a more intuitive way to rearrange your document structure.
> 
> **Alternative Techniques:**
> 
> - **Cut and Paste:** This might seem basic, but it's a viable option for smaller sections. Simply select the heading and its content, cut it, and then paste it in the desired location.
>     
> - **Heading Shifter Plugin:** This plugin allows you to **change the heading level** (number of "#" symbols) of multiple headings at once. While not directly moving the heading itself, it can help restructure your document by adjusting the hierarchy. [Search for Heading Shifter plugin on obsidian.md]
>     
> 
> While Obsidian doesn't currently offer a perfect equivalent to Emacs' `org-refile` for headings, these methods provide more efficient ways to manage and rearrange your document structure.

# Blockier Plugin
See: [[#Blockier Plugin|Blockier Plugin]]
- ctrl-a selects test *after* block type identifier e.g. '\#\#'
	- makes it easy to move stuff around
# Text Transporter Plugin
From: [GitHub - TfTHacker/obsidian42-text-transporter](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-text-transporter)
From: [How to use Text Transporter - TfT Hacker](https://tfthacker.com/Obsidian+Plugins+by+TfTHacker/Text+Transporter/How+to+use+Text+Transporter) ^60fh7n
### Useful

- **All Commands List** give you a menu of all TT commands ^qcfgsm
- Meaning of "actions"
	- "**Push**": *move* something **to** other file
	- "**Pull**": *move* **from** another file ^pzlpzf
	- "**Send**": send plain *links,* don't modify current file
	- "**Copy**": *don't modify source* file, do something w/ the copy/ref of it
- @ **Copy block embeds from this selection**: puts embed for selection into clipboard: paste it somewhere else and you see the embed.  Deserves its own shortcut ^0qbdaz
- **Pull lines from another file as block embeds**: you give it a file (easy completion) and it helps you select what to embed in that file, and copy it to current cursor position ^b4j80q
- **Push line/selection to another file as block embeds**: you select, it puts it in spec'ed file @ spec'ed place ^odkega
	- not clear to me what "block" it will send.  Seems to send a bigger embed than I meant, if it includes a headline.
- I would like to pull/copy <u>links</u> to blocks too ^dzifrk
	- [x] [Feature Request: link to block with link text from block · Issue #76](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-text-transporter/issues/76) ^zv2u3m
- A huge number of options and confusing documentation ^jke9d7
- Nice that you can <u>select block/heading after which to append</u>, or just insert at top
- Clutters the right mouse menu: a way to clean this up in the settings? ^kvw5ze
- Would be nice if push/copy/send commands made a destination file if one didn't exist, and inserted a link to it in the original source file
	- [x] [Feature Request: Option to create new file when copy/push/send to a non existent file, link to it · Issue #77](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-text-transporter/issues/77)

# Block Drag-n-Drop Plugin
From: [GitHub - artem-barmin/obsidian-block-drag-n-drop: Allow moving/copying/and creation embeds for blocks with drag-n-drop just like Logseq or Roam](https://github.com/artem-barmin/obsidian-block-drag-n-drop)

**Seems Dead**: message says its been archived.

It's not quite org-refile and friends so I didn't try it yet.  Main use would be to move chunks out of daily notes to their own pages or some project page.  That would probably require headline handling, and flexibility about which of source or destination end up being the embed location.

- Can drag and drop lists but not headers, 
- within or between pages.  
- Options to move, <span style="color:#ffc000">embed</span> or copy at the destination 
- options for handling what indentation looks like
# Note Refactor Plugin
Ffom: [GitHub - lynchjames/note-refactor-obsidian: Allows for text selections to be copied (refactored) into new notes and notes to be split into other notes.](https://github.com/lynchjames/note-refactor-obsidian)

Many ways to move chunks out of a note into a *new* note file(s), leaves a link(s) or a transclusion(s) in place.  Either by selection or by splitting.  Has templates.

- has option config to <u>leave transclusions instead of links</u>.  I want this!
- would like "select all children" option of some kind
	- [ ] can this be built w/ other obsidian/obsidian plugin "select all children" commands?
- Headline levels reset to 1st heading is level 0
	- but won't this mess up transclude?
	- [ ] workaround: replace headings w/ bullets in dest file; in source file, make link a heading or bullet?
- if destination file exists, will append.
	- would be nice if you could select heading in existing file to append to, litquieke [[#Text Transporter Plugin|Text Transporter Plugin]]
- destination selection kinda dumb
	- *Can* be configured to start w/ files in directory of source note
	- but doesn't autocomplete folders or filenames w/ TAB
- template would allow the auto creation of YAML header or properties or whatever (I think)
	- but I don't see a way to inherit properties e.g. tabs, from source document
- last commit was 6 months ago (3/29/24)
# Embed Xcel Plugin
From: [Obsidian Excel Plugin：easy to handle markdown table - Share & showcase - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-excel-plugin-easy-to-handle-markdown-table/66709) ^3dkar9

Embeds Excel file in obsidian.  I haven't tried it uet, but it looks like what OneNote and Evernote can do.  Can store and edit `xlsx` files in your vault.

Plotly Plugin
From: [GitHub - Dmytro-Shulha/obsidian-plotly: Obsidian plugin to embed Plotly charts into markdown notes.](https://github.com/Dmytro-Shulha/obsidian-plotly)

Plotly plots in your vault.  Static ones to start; interactive, DataviewJS, which I guess is compatible w/ Obsidian, maybe could be installed in it?.  Interesting, but I did not try.
- `toggleFold` : fold or unfold item at current position# Hotkey Helper Plugin
From: [GitHub - pjeby/hotkey-helper: Easily see and access any Obsidian plugin's options pane or hotkey assignments (including conflicts) from the Community Plugins tab](https://github.com/pjeby/hotkey-helper)

Helps deal w/ plugin and non-plugin hotkeys, somehow.  Recommended by [Pane-Relief](https://github.com/pjeby/pane-relief) plugin

I don't see much change, but two commands might be useful (find with ctrl+P)
- go direct to a plugin's settings (run it and select plugin)
- go direct to a plugin's hotkeys
- two other functions seem redudndant
# Command-URI plugin
From: [GitHub - deathau/command-uri-obsidian: Trigger any command palette command via an obsidian:// uri](https://github.com/deathau/command-uri-obsidian)
Runs an obsidian command from anywhere on your computer.  
- Can do something in obsidian by clicking on a link in OneNote or Zotero?
- daily note?
- a new zettelkasten (what author did this for)
- somehow, put this on your "browser speed dial"
- Could be interesting but I didn't try it
