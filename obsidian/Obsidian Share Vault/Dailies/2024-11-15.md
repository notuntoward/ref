# WorkOnClimate LinkedIn Group Meeting

## Points from the LinkedIn Person's Presentation
### LinkedIn Features
- LinkedIn has a Green Jobs Filter for job search
	- dig up screen shot
- follow companies
- use `opentowork` setting
	- some say it's cringy, but it does get results
	- doubles likelihood of recruiter contract
- has options to avoid sharing this message with your own employer
- can set alerts for jobs matching your preferences
- apply early: 13% more likely to get job if apply within 1st 3 pages of listing
### Linked in Profile
- is for ALL employers
- can be quite long vs. resumes
- endorsements, etc.
- have photo ===> 21X more views, 9x more connection requests
- headline: show why you're unique
- summary: 1-2 sentences about you; 3-5 sentences about experience
- 1-2 sentences about your goal, how people should engage with you
- skills filters are being used more often by employers
### Building network

- 4X mo0re likely to get hired at companies where have connections (I'd guess not layered by appropriate experience, etc.)
- can ask for informational interviews
