### ESIG Webinar: Advances in the use of Wind and Solar Forecasting
From: [G-PST/ESIG Webinar Series: Advances in the Use of Wind and Solar Forecasting - ESIG](https://www.esig.energy/event/g-pst-esig-webinar-series-advances-in-the-use-of-wind-and-solar-forecasting/)
Amber Motley, Dir. S.T forecasting, CAISO

- the usual forecasting stuff, comparable to DE 5 years ago, possibly.  Then...
- Probabilistic forecasting uses
	- Day Ahead
		- "situational awareness"
		- low confidence band goes into forward planning
		- RUC uncertainty 
		- Regulation rqts
		- "vendor optimization": picking the best forecast vendor for a given weather situation. 
	- Realtime
		- "operator awareness"
		- Potential Future: inside of Flexible Ramping Product
- Forecasting alerts ID future extreme weather events 
	- up to 365 hours ahead
	- meteorologist team
	- somehow use probabilistic forecasts, says they are "really critical"
- Advanced system health indicator warning
	- 8-10 day horizon
	- load
	- renewables
	- "RA" resources supply
	- transmission, etc.
- Uncertainty during ramps

- Multiple vendor optimization

  - sounds like they just pick the best one, even though they do "blends"
  - It's a manual choice by a meteorologist
- "Persistence Based Renewable forecast"
	- they do their own
	- eliminates 6 mins of lag due to data xfer to vendors, who also do persistence
	- helps a lot, I missed how that was measured.  "Half the error" at some horizon and some metric
- Storage
	- Hybrid resource: single ID for battery and solar (e.g.)
	- Co-located: 2 IDs, can be controlled separately
	- designation affects what kind of forecasting required by CAISO (optional for hybrid, I think, supplied by CAISO)
	- HSL
		- missed what this is
		- but somehow makes it possible to get telemetry when resource is being downregulated, I think.
- Q&A
	- Q: how important is event time vs. event magnitude
		- A: both e.g. setup for upcoming hurricane: time was important, could use uncertainties for magnitude uncertainty
	- Q: how use prob frcst for resource adequacy and risk assmt
		- A: I think they start planning using low end quantile, eventually put in expected value closer to power deliv time
	- Q: How present uncertainty to operators
		- A: confidence bands, must be done at net load (for grid operator)
	- Q: what events have higher error
		- A: 10 min forecast error: 1.2-1.4% MAPE (normalized MAE)

		- A: fog burnoff is hard, winter is hard b/c (like DE)
	- Q: how do forecasts figure into bids and offers
		- A: majority of resources "economically offer in"
			- forecast done by CAISO
			- dispatch done using this forecast
	- Q: something about insurance
		- A: prob frcsts used somehow in risk assmt, I think
