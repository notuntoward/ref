JonD, JamesD, Forrest

- AWS 'glue' figures out what tables to make new tables from CSV in S3
- does it automatically, if things change, somehow.
- produces tables you can query
- many have dups, one a recognizable tables and names; the other the same name w/ a long hash string appended
- Forrest wants to store everything as strings, leaving the conversion to me.  I said OK.
- TODOs
	- [ ] Table names from me to JonD
	- [ ] James: figure out why there are so many hashes
	- [ ] James: add time-of-storage variable
	- [ ] James: paste Archive and Realtime together, so it's a single query instead of 2
	- [ ] James: is data duplicated (he wasn't sure, Forrest thought it didn't matter, so I'm not sure this was on his list, actually, but I hope he figures it out)
