# Font Size Adjuster Plugin
From: [GitHub - RyotaUshio/obsidian-font-size: An Obsidian.md plugin to adjust font size via commands.](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-font-size)

Changes the note font size without changing the UI (like the default obsidian `Zoom In` command does).  Size change affects *all non-UI fonts.*

| Key       | Function                         | Plugin             |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| C-=       | increment font size              | font size adjuster |
| C--       | decrement font size              | font size adjuster |
| C-shift-= | reset font size                  | font size adjuster |
| C-alt-=   | zoom in                          | stock obsidian     |
| C-alt--   | zoom out                         | stock obsidian     |
| *alt--*   | *zoom out*                       | *Tabzoom*          |
| *alt-+*   | *zoom in*                        | *Tabzoom*          |
|           | *[reset font size]()*            | *Not implemented*  |
|           | *set custom zoom level for pane* | *Tabzoom*          |

# Simple Zoom Plugin
From: [GitHub - Maxymillion/simple-zoom: An Obsidian plugin which adds more zoom control.](https://github.com/Maxymillion/simple-zoom)

Does the same as [[#Font Size Adjuster Plugin]], but is in β,  must be installed with BRAT, and makes obnoxious popup messages every time you zoom.

**Uninstalled** 

# Tabzoom Plugin
From: [GitHub - huachuman/Obsidian-Tabzoom: Tabzoom! is an Obsidian plugin to adjust the text zoom level of individual tabs without affecting the interface or other tabs.](https://github.com/huachuman/Obsidian-Tabzoom)

Same as [[#Font Size Adjuster Plugin]] and [[#Simple Zoom Plugin]], except affects only the tab you're on, which seems better.  

But it's BRAT-only, very β, and has no options.  Note that "reset font size" in [[#Font Size Adjuster Plugin]] won't reset the font adjusted by Tabzoom.

- Obsidian froze a few minutes after Installed this. It even crashed after I disabled it, so now, it's uninstalled.
- feature request: [reset font · Issue #1 · huachuman/Obsidian-Tabzoom · GitHub](https://github.com/huachuman/Obsidian-Tabzoom/issues/1

	**Uninstalled** see if author updates it, fixes bugs
