# Plugin repl Plugin
From: [GitHub - talwrii/plugin-repl: ...](https://github.com/talwrii/plugin-repl)

For quickly testing out fragments of plugin code -- could be a way to ease into plugin writing.  This plugin came from an emacs user, who I guess misses org-mode, and tinkers with elisp in a scratch buffer.  He [says](https://github.com/talwrii/obsidian-header-navigation) "I make productivity tools and AI tools related to reading and research. If that sounds interesting you can follow me on twitter or bluesky."  Maybe I should. 
- He also wrote [[#Header navigation plugin]].

**Try the plugin sometime**
# Gotoheading Plugin
From: [GitHub - oin/obsidian-gotohead...](https://github.com/oin/obsidian-gotoheading)

Very similar to [[Dailies/2025-02-10.md#Header Navigation Plugin |Header Navigation Plugin]] but it has a switcher that lets you switch between headings in a note or a folder (but I might prefer the outline pane for its collapsibility and headline movability)

**Try it for a while** 
# Heading Decorator Plugin
From: [GitHub - dragonish/obsidian-he...](https://github.com/dragonish/obsidian-heading-decorator)

Similar to [[2023-08-19#Lapel plugin]] but with hierarchical heading level markers (and other things) instead.  The hierarchical numbers are slightly ugly, and take up more space than the lapel plugin markers, but they are more informative, and are arguably more subtle than with the [[2024-05-16#Numbered Headings plugin]].

I like that both the numbers and the indents give you a better clue about how deep you are in the hierarchy.
