# PJM 5CP P1 PRD Review Meeting
- will buy 1st; maybe build in 2nd stage
- zonal (utility) forecast
- something about solar: seemed like it's included?
- [ ] figure out what kind of load is being forecasted: w/ or w/o peak forecasting participants
	- PLC adds back DR contribution, does weather adjust
	- NSPL does not, no weather adjust
- [ ] meet w/ Jasmine to scope this out afterwards
- ConEd has highest charges, so will be 1st target
# Header Enhancer plugin
From [here](https://github.com/HoBeedzc/obsidian-header-enhancer-plugin).

Makes headers numbered, except for a title.  Can turn it off or on in the yaml.  I haven't tried it yet.
# Better Search Views plugin
From [here](https://github.com/jensmtg/influx)

Includes context and images if there are any, on the page around: 
- a backlink 
- around the hit,   
Seems to help omnisearch and regular search, although regular search doesn't blow out pictures.  Backlinks are definitely nicer. 

It works well, but here's my

**Installed**

# Enhancing Export plugin
From [here](https://github.com/mokeyish/obsidian-enhancing-export?tab=readme-ov-file)

An obsidian page to many formats.  Most interesting are: .docx, pdf, latex, but there are many more. I tested word for this daily note and it kinda works.  Uses Pandoc, I think?  But it's got bugs, doesn't work as well as other options.

- headers are OK
- bullets are OK, although some problems w/ my TODO squares 
- messes by badly on the dense test markdown header/bullet mixed stuff below.  Odd b/c it works on stuff on this page before that.
- exporting to .docx badly screws up on [[Gen AI Talk Ideas]].  Seems to fail when there are tons of bullets in a row.
	- [[2024-03-06#Pandoc Exportn Plugin]] works well exporting to docx
- PDF export works quite well
	-  initially failed to export that doc to pdf.
		- got a long error message popup, at the end said: `"LaTeX error: File xcolor.sty" not found.`
		- file was probably wiped out when I updated all my choco packages.
	- Solution was to use the latex program I installed with choco to simply install all latex packages running: `tlmgr install scheme-full` in a admin terminal (see howto.org)
	- [[2024-04-02#Better Export PDF plugin]] is slightly less fancy but output is roughly equivalent for pdfs

**Uninstalled**

# Header Size & Vertical Margin

Try to shrink headers to take less vertical space
