# AEMO arrival times / ATHENA setup
- w/ Forrest
- About arrival times, Forrest says
	- everything AEMO puts out is stored in Athena
	- they've added an ingestion time stamp there
	- BUT, none-of the forecasting services use the Athena connection, though, and it's been hard for him to get this migration going, sounds like this is going to take a while
- About Athena, Forrest says
	- Contact James Donn after 4pm today about reading Athena
		- [x] would make sense to follow on with [this Slack thread](https://growingenergylabs.slack.com/archives/C03EHN0JSQ1/p1708393277285999)
	- Before that, rejuvenate AWS connection so ready to read.
		- contact Cris
