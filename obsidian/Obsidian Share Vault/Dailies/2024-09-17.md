# Ryan Boesen call: what to do about Dad's fraud attacks?
- My questions
	- [ ] Can you see from data how the account is getting attacked
	- [ ] Do you have any hunches?
	- [ ] Where can I go to track this down?
## Explanation of Past Frauds
Seems to have been only two of them
- 5/31/24 Fraud
	- Dad gave his debit card number to fake Microsoft call
	- acct had to be closed out
	- I think this was the "Indian accent" one, after which Dad cancelled his Amazon account
- 9/24: a "fluke," for $1
	- they refunded it
	- it was from his MasterCard debit card
	- if it was denied, criminals move on to next number
- His theory for how frauds happened
	- his computer was hacked on the MS call
	- they could have gotten his AMZ and other autopay info from his laptop
	- Dad gets FDIC protection unless he willingly gives his account number (Bremmer acct. number) to a fraudster, and then Bremmer can't get the money back.
## Ryan's suggestions
- [x] I should sign up for remote account (done)
	- will need last statement balance, which is: $37,484.78 
	- acct number: 523623292
- [x] Dad should call to set up online payments (I told Dad)
- [ ] ? Dad should have credit (not Bremmer debit) card reissued, if the card number didn't change.  Did it change?
