# Research Team Kickoff Meeting
JonD, Mukunda
JonD says:
> I thought it would be a good idea to meet and discuss our new team’s mission/mandate, plans, and strategy.  Scott has a wealth of experience managing research programs in Europe so it would be good to get him up to speed and get his perspective on what we have going on so far.
# Mukunda says
- mandate is to explore new routes
- products have a lot of constraints, prevents exploration
- can't build everything internally
- put on long term deliverables hat
- create new, unique, collaborate
- US is best place to look (Amir's CA contacts didn't work)
- [ ] ? kick off Microsoft project: what is it?
- likes Byron's proposal AI4OPT at Georgia Tech
- JonD thought price-sensitive bidding
	- JonD had another variant
- no customer churn, factory pred maint not yet scoped
	- should be one step above time series data
	- more exploratory period for 3-6 months
- says we haven't done much on forecasting, nothing unique
- have no hiring budget
- were planning to hire 2 more: 
	- [ ] AI expert from MS ($800K/year?).  What was this?
- required to do external?
	- I'm not sure he knows
- Agrees that students are a good idea
- [ ] # find partners in the US
- Money is hard
	- modules are losing money
	- be careful as to committing a lot
	- AI4OPT: $200k for year, spread across 3 people
- [ ] # come up w/ list, brainstorm w/ JonL and Mukunda first, discuss
- [ ] look for Unis focused on energy, maybe other org
## My points

- Generative is hottest thing
- Current forecasting state for QCELLs kind of problem
	- LightGM still beating all in hourly forecasting
		- [[Manokhin23worksTSfrcstNixtla|What Truly Works in Time Series Forecasting — The Results from Nixtla’s Mega Study]]
			- A standardish time series method comes out almost as well: [[Challu22NHiTSNeuralHierarchical]]
			- The AI4OPT paper, [[Lim21TemporalFusionTransfr]], compared against some weak algorithms, hard to say how good it is.
		- Might be something in very short horizon forecasts.  Not much evidence for that.
	- Nagging forecasting problems
		- Biggest problem with forecasting is DATA
		- Dimensionality / feature selection (modern methods care less, if lots of data)
		- startup time is a problem
		- DS productivity
		- Startup time for new site (transfer learning, etc.)
- How research programs work
	- It's not like buying a software package
		- written to make papers
		- IP problems, since not good to them unless they publish
		- they're not rewarded for good quality, more for papers
		- they're looking for research grants, for research, not production code
		- novelty, not necessarily better than simpler methods
		- differences with buying from a company
			- lower quality, not production grade
			- compute performance
			- longer lead times
			- same data problems we have
		- getting PhD students is best
	- Why do it?
		- Goal has to be to get the know-how into the company: not just use it, not just provide data
		- Keep company engineers fresh
		- Add expertise you don't already have
	- How organize it
		- research proposal competitions better than buying (takes longer, though)
		- Industrial consortiums spread both cost and expertise (tricky IP problems) 
		- **DOE grants are a way to fund them**: it's how you get it cheap
			- DOE likes consortiums
# AI4OPT Meeting
This was the optimization research group that Mukunda and JonD had already started making arrangements with for research with QCELLS.
- Stephaine L Sigler, Pascal Van Hentenyck, JonD, Mukunda
- Stephanie discovered that: Juan Pablo "karabiene (sp?)", from QCELLs is already working on an NDA with the org
	- she'll figure out who he is
	- thinks we can nearly copy that agreement (NDA)
- IP: once published in the US, you have a year to get a patent
	- Mukunda cares b/c we're international
	- Pascal says: get a delay to publishing so QCELLs has time to file a patent first
		- he thinks they can publish around specific new things
		- adjacent problems, synthetic test cases
	- Mukunda: QCELLS is pantentee, write all this down
	- Pascal: they have an IP team too, and they'll discuss w/ QCELLS
- Pascal: NSF has 3 strong letters in favor of this research, doesn't need letter from Mukunda
- Pascal: does conformal pred, high dim forecasting.  He can show results.
	- he's hiring more people
	- are deploying w/ some partners
	- does massive ML in energy space
- Mukunda
	- we have to do due dilligence w/ other Universities e.g. Stanford
	- 4 projects in sequence
	- may do 1st internally, maybe they do day ahead
	- need more discussion w/ JonD and Scott before finalizing
	- Next: followup meeting; 
		- JonD will look @ it
		- get NDA cleared, just template for agreement
- Pascal
	- NSF doesn't fund X (industry?)
	- but he can go after DOE, etc.
	- "this is not unconventional at all," just send template
- Mukunda
	- where do you extremely excell
	- # Pascal: simulate whole market
		- did it w/ MISO
			- [ ] # price curves!
			- says they can simulate clear in seconds, or something like that
		- says CAISO is problem b/c of data
			- also weird market clearing algorithm, "a certain degree of complexit"
			- but they definitely want to do CAISO
		- Pascal: optimize a bunch of stuff
		- stochastic optimization
