Some plugins I looked into mentioned in: [The Top 4% of Obsidian Plugins - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVQGrn9gQKI) or which I found related to them.
# Outliner plugin
From: [outliner](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner)

Adds commands for navigating and creating *list* hierarchies, **not headings**.  Ideally, this would make lists foldable, movable, etc. with shortcuts, as in Emacs org-mode.  Has some synergy in this regard with  [[2024-03-09#Heading Shifter Plugin]] (`TAB` behavior). This plugin is different than the basic [[#Outline core plugin|Outline core plugin]], which was better than the [[#Quiet Outline Plugin|Quiet Outline Plugin]] at some point (7/2024).  These make an outline navigation pane, and that's about it.

- Options: I've turned all of them on.  Settings of note:
	- Stick the cursor to the content
		- controls how the cursor can more near bullet and checkbox
		- [ ] I've set it to: "stick cursor out of bullets and checkboxes": 
			- means cursor can't move on top of these, only between bullets
			- but if move cursor to beginning of line, can delete the symbol, 
				- makes kind of a mess
				- merges w/ previous 
				- breaks hierarchy
	- vertical indentation lines are set up, s/ collapse if click on them
		- But I can't get the clicking to work
		- I originally though this was b/c of my special bullet symbols? [[2023-12-02#org-mode like bullets w/ css snippets|org-mode like bullets w/ css snippets]]
		- But docs say the vertical lines only work on default theme.  
		- But the lines are visible on the Anappuccin theme, and just the right amount of subtlety.
- Nice that there are hierarchical `move lists and sublists` up/down commands, but they only work on lists, not headings!
	- [ ] My feature request to hierarchically move headings too: [option to mov...](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner/issues/561) ^l2va
- Turns that the [[2024-03-09#Heading Shifter Plugin]] can make `TAB` and `SHIFT+TAB` indent/outdent headings
- also see my [[#Creases plugin|Creases plugin]] fold/unfold feature request

**Installed**: I use it all the time
# Hotkeys++ plugin

This works fine, but there are [[2024-03-24#Refactoring / Editing Hotkey plugins|other plugins]] that might be better, so I **uninstalled** it.

# Text Format plugin
* [GitHub - Benature/obsidian-text-format: Format seleted text in Obsdidian.md](https://github.com/Benature/obsidian-text-format)
* a grab bag of things, mainly about fixing up text you'ved copied from somewhere else
* could do the case toggling [GitHub - MatthewAlner/obsidian-toggle-case: Obsidian plugin to toggle between \`lowercase\` \`UPPERCASE\` and \`Title Case\`](https://github.com/MatthewAlner/obsidian-toggle-case)
	* which I've already installed

# Lapel plugin
From: [obsidian-lapel](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-lapel)
* Makes a little `H*` mark, letting you know what heading level you're at.
	* I'm setting its size in `.obsidian/snippets/lapel_heading_markder_size.css`
* Get a level change menu if you click on them
* Only in editing mode, so it doesn't clutter up reading view
* Can also [give each level a different symbol](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-lapel?tab=readme-ov-file#-customization).  
	* Maybe easier to see than `H1`, `H2`, ...
	* [ ] Could try `H*` with different levels of size, boldness, color, translucence,...
* From the same guy who wrote [[#Creases|Creases]]
* Also see [[Dailies/2025-03-31.md#Heading Decorator Plugin |Heading Decorator Plugin]], which can also make H1, H2, etc. type headers, and more
* Also see [[2024-05-16#Numbered Headings plugin]]
# Creases plugin
From: [obsidian-crease](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-creases)
* somehow helps you fold headlines if you add a magic bit of code to your page
* couldn't figure out what it did
* Also, does it interfere with other folding commands
* Mostly confusing, partly obsoleted, and maybe unnecessary
	* mixes actions on headings & lists with Obsidian Fold More / Fold Less
		* only headings
		* Obsidian Fold More/less works on bot headings and lists
	* "folding up to level current level" business requires too much thinking
	* saving folding configuration in search not really that necessary
		* works on *all headings*
		* current Obsidian search unfolds to the level of what it finds, 
			* doesn't mess up folding where you were
			* so not too bad to collapse
		* folding config is also now saved by Obsidian, so don't need to crease
			* [ ] possibly, <span style="color:#ffc000">you do lose it when you kill obsidian??</span>
* <u>One useful use</u>
	* incrementally unfolding/folding headings on the whole page
* Creases seem to be a way to manually save and restore folding at the current state.  *Useful?*
* Is written by the same guy who wrote [[#Lapel|Lapel]], which is a nice little thing,  He's also an Obsidian dev, I guess.
* Would he make an emacs incremental folder that cycles?  
	* [x] My feature request for emacs folding: [Feature Request: cyclic folding · Issue #57 · liamcain/obsidian-creases](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-creases/issues/57#issue-2204597862  *No response in 1 year*  
	* Also see my [[2024-03-09#Heading Shifter Plugin]] `TAB` override request
