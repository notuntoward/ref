# University Forecasting Research (JonL meeting)
- My points
	- update on Mukunda's
		- brainstorming
		- plan w/o discussion?
	- how did you make your plan?
	- look @ opt in loop stuff?
		- better robust
	- define forecast priorities?
- How plan was made
	- U defined ahead
	- 10 research projects that were things you wanted to investigate via opt. group
		- Mukunda wanted to prioritize FOM
		- made list smaller than 10
		- defined ones you wanted to work on yourselves
		- so GAtech got 5-6 lists
		- assumes some prob frcst
- [ ] do joint forecast and opt brainstorm
	- inputs to optimization
	- optimization in loop
	- Gurobi solver can use NN as constraint
	- battery wear: QCELLS currently only have X cents/charge cost
		- JonD says simple model for long-term revenue modeling
		- JonD: for big battery, probably want to model degradation
		- [ ] find out about UW battery paper
	- aggregate VPP
		- JonD: don't know rules of game yet
		- JonD: chariot: TX retail company, price forecasting now.  
		- Maybe want customer aggregate load forecast
- Opt prior
	- Load forecasting sucks
	- RF forecasts: 
		- no extrapolation
		- optimizer already set up to prob load forecast, but no prob forecast
			- scenarios of load or pv
				- combos and permuations of load and PV scenaris not done on optimization
				- old work: nearest neighbor scenario generator
			- takes N scenarios.
				- shared 1st decision across all 3 optimizer copies
				- then indep operation on scenarios for now
				- tree structure
	- polyhedrals could be on brainstorm list
- [ ] optimization/forecast brainstorming meeting
	- JonD wants to represent optimization project
	- [ ] coordinate w/ Amir for brainstorming meeting
	- [ ] take Amir's list seriously
	- [ ] JonD thinks GA tech could be THE early forecast
- [ ] jonD to walk through old work talk
## My thoughts from this meeting

- main optimization concern is "should I charge at this (possibly expensive price) in order to discharge at some (possibly profitable) time in the future
- A OneNote scratch space to scribble ideas: [Optimizer Decisions given a price forecast](onenote:https://d.docs.live.net/4bbd96b3698748f8/Documents/Geli/priceFrcstAEMO.one#Optimizer%20Decisions%20given%20a%20price%20forecast&section-id={7D480E6A-BF05-4D0A-AA7B-D26AB3EFF72D}&page-id={6F795C70-2FBD-4EB6-B0F2-A26A2BF4B7DB}&end)
- [ ] # read a paper on battery arbitrage

# AEMO Price Forecast Mtng (YiXin and JonD)
- my points
	- max horiz
	- temporal resolution after 55 mins
	- format
- answers
	- 24 hr forecast horizon
	- want high prices or low prices in next few hours
	- 10-20 mins off is OK
- target idea
	- % prob of it being greater than X dollars in some duration
