# Quick Explorer Plugin
From: [GitHub - pjeby/quick-explorer:...](https://github.com/pjeby/quick-explorer)

A bit like the windows explorer directory bread crumbs.  No need to open Obsidian's File Explorer LHS pane. Instead, you can click on any part of the path at the top over your note to view the contents of a folder at or above the one your note is in.  There are also shortcuts.

- I mapped `Explore Vault` to `Alt + E`
- Right now, though, I prefer clicking on the breadcrumbs, as `Explore Vault` opens up a hard-to-navigate thing jammed against the left screen.
- [x] My Windows Snap Bug Report: [Doesn't work with Windows Snap...](https://github.com/pjeby/quick-explorer/issues/97)  **Fixed**

**Installed**
