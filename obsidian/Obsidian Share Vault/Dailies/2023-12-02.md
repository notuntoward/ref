# org-mode like bullets w/ css snippets
- a css snippet response to [my feature request](https://github.com/lilian-pouliquen/obsidian-custom-list-character/issues/2)
- make org-mode superstar-like bullets
- works, except in reading view
- seems to mess with text size in notes but I'm not sure if it really does
- to adust tweak .obsidian/snippets/emacs_unordered_list.css
# CSS snippet archive
- lot's of them here: [GitHub - Dmytro-Shulha/obsidian-css-snippets](https://github.com/Dmytro-Shulha/obsidian-css-snippets)
- Interesting ones
	- [Resizable Mermaid Diagrams.md](https://github.com/Dmytro-Shulha/obsidian-css-snippets/blob/master/Snippets/Resizable%20Mermaid.md)
		- But also see [[2024-10-03#Diagram Zoom Drag Plugin|Diagram Zoom Drag Plugin]]
	- [Embeds.md](https://github.com/Dmytro-Shulha/obsidian-css-snippets/blob/master/Snippets/Embeds.md): several attempts to make transclusion look normal, snipped following this one had something about pdf export of transcluded snippets.  I tried a couple but couldn't get them to work.  Didn't try everything.
	- [Markers.md](https://github.com/Dmytro-Shulha/obsidian-css-snippets/blob/master/Snippets/Markers.md): part of it (trailing spaces) might be nice, at least I like this in emacs
