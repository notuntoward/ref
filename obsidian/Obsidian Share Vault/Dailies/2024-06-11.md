# PDF++ hang bug report
- Bug report of pdf++ hanging obsidian on ink-heavy pdfs?
	- e.g. this [file](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Share%20Vault&file=lit%2Flit_sources%2FLi18HyperbandNovelBanditbased.pdf)
	- doesn't happen when only pdf++ is in a sandbox vault
	- I turned off smart connections and it still happens (in my normal vault)
	- **Actually**, the problem is that: [[2024-06-12#Minimal theme kills pdf reader]]
