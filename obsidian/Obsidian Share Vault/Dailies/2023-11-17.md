# Report on VDER Launch Performance: 2023 (meeting)
- Got $1.7 M in 2023 revenue 
	- for Geli, or for customer, I didn't understand 
	- see [[#^0ce25f|revenue sharing]]
- VDER most profitable battery type in NYISO market 
	- for customer?
	- for Geli too?
- 74% of possible VDER revenue was captured by QCELLS in 2023
	- assuming $200/kWh DRV
		- value for last year
		- don't know yet about 2024
	- main reason it wasn't 100%: battery health
		- availability as low as 56% during DRV windows (Aug, Littlefield A); 
		- best was 90% (Sept. Littlefield B)
	- Also, missed some DRV b/c of late site commissioning
- Raw Yearly Peak Prediction Performance
	- 100% ICAP revenue (hit ICAP peak hour at full discharge)
	- Discharged almost 100% on all of top-10-in-year hours 
		- exception was Sept 6
		- 4th ranked hour wasn't discharged on (by design), and that was the top 10 peak
		- 5th ranked hour on that day got partially discharged on, b/c it was already a DRV hour, but purposely wasn't discharging @ 100% (I think.  Maybe I missed this point)
	- DRV revenue
		- 98.7% capture rate of DRV, looking purely at peak detection performance
		- 3 predicted peak hours cost some DRV, I thin
- 2 hour battery performance (not in production)
	- Hit ICAP for the year
	- Got 64% of total VDER revenue gotten
		- Lost 1/3 ICAP b/c of discharge conservatism
			- ICAP was discharged over 3 hours, so power 2/3 of max power
		- DRV losses
		- Causes full DRV window miss, so lost more DRV
		- DRV was 7-11pm, so will lose DRV revenue anyway
	- Could get 76% of DRV capture if did something I missed (non-conservative approach?)
- Weekend discharge
	- 2023: weekend discharges so far
	- 2022: 3 weekend discharges
	- [ ] Jasmine to verify weekend rule (didn't she already?)
	- [ ] Me, to figure out what to do about weekends
- Next
	- known upcoming NYISO VDER projects for 2024
		- Basset Ave (2 hour, 7-11pm (1st one we've had))
		- Delavan (4 our, 2-6pm (hopefully like 4-8pm window in 2023))
	- Had 55 project requests, from customers, I think
	- New VDER configs: probably none in 2024, I think
		- not much business interest in solar+VDER
		- so far, all sites are load-less
		- Currently, we're selling a fixed subscription, but moving towards revenue sharing ^0ce25f
	- 2024 will be a good VDER year
		- only competitor will be STEM, so we're "experienced" compared to others
	- 2025 might be huge for VDER
	- will be some VDER marketing activity this summer, 
		- maybe some conferences.  
		- No mention of who.
	- Non-VDER Coincident Peak sites
		- what Jasmine talked to me about a month ago, not exactly VDER projects but similar
		- paid for consumption (reduction?) during peak hour (5 coincident peak)
		- 1st project: Q3 2024 (PJM)
