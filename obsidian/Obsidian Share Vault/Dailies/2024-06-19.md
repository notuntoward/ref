# Cursor Visibility CSS
From: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/control-the-cursors-appearance/59340/2?u=scotto 

With [[2024-06-18#Emacs Text Editor Plugin]], I found that, for some reason, not using the arrow keys made it harder to see where the cursory was, even though the cursor was the same size.  So I copied CSS from the link above, and put it in cursor_styles.css.  

I need to tweak this some more.
- I don't like the blinking but don't know how to turn it off
- it's too high, even after I hacked it.
- [ ] # the css worked for a while, but then highlighting failed entirely.
- [Supposedly](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/The-cursor-in-gle5D9IlSbWBNFc1J6v58Q), Ninja Cursor will make cursor css work but it didn't for me
- I could possibly just get by with the `AnapPuccin theme` `File Editor & Markdown Elements --> active line highlight` settings, with "borders-only"
- [ ] Anuppuccin feature request: [Feature Request cursor app...](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin/issues/296)

**Disable this CSS for now**, make do with AnaPuccin setting above.
# Ninja Cursor
From:[GitHub - vrtmrz/ninja-cursor](https://github.com/vrtmrz/ninja-cursor)

Idea was to make cursor more visible, but this was annoyingly flashy -- [[#Cursor Visibility CSS|Cursor Visibility CSS]] seemed a better solution.
