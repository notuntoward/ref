# Databricks Seminar from Royal Cyber
Leverage Databricks Predictive Analytics to Enhance Power and Energy Infrastructure: [link](https://global.gotowebinar.com/join/3368453265561101910/888484739)

- Generative AI: they do it: transformers, text, images... (for power systems?)
## Databricks wind turbine anomaly detection / predictive maintenance
- a bunch of data munging (downsampling, merging, ...) done in .ipynb files
- much done with SQL queries in notebooks
- DEs do all this and pass it on to ML engineers, who do the turbine predictive maintenance stuff
- ML eng gets it as a table
- actually runs AutoML, so no code written
	- is trained to predict anomalous sensors
	- after a model chose, it get registered, stored in a catalog
- In inference time
	- I'm not clear on how realtime data is fed in, if those DE notebooks are rerun
		- but he said a "sparkbook has run"
- data admin governance
	- has all data, volumes, models
	- can allow, deny what can be read and written (DataBricks "unity catalog" feature, I think)
	- Flow graph through notebooks (I think) shows
		- processing flow for an output, shows intermediate tables
		- data version (I think)
	- admin can automatically, or manually trigger this graph to run
		- nice plot showing job process status
		- when done, click on a "predictive dashboard"
			- revenue
			- num. faulty parts
			- shows revenue impact of faulty parts (THIS IS WHAT THAT crusty QCELLS guy wanted.  See old meeting notes)
			- maintenance recommendations
- seems like they did predict when a turbine part would fail, but I'm not sure
- says that this DataBricks avoids siloing, allows all to see where data came from, etc.
