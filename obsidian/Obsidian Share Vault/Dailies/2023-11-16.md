# Webinar: U.S. Large-Scale Solar Photovoltaics Database - Release of a new geospatial dataset
- [Webinar invite](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/webinar/FMfcgzGwHftwtjcGcwzwwdrFnBbtPPDr)
- DB contains only location, azimuth, tilt, etc. and "technology" 
- only large, ground-mounted panels e.g. "large rooftop" facilities were excluded
- [x] could we find physical parameters about QCELLS sites in the US with this? Probably not, give the above.
- [ ] Does AUS have something similar for households?
- described in paper: [United States Large-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Database (ver. 1.0, November 2023) - ScienceBase-Catalog](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/6442d8a2d34ee8d4ade8e6db)
- Accessible in many ways, including online web browser viewer, or API via Jupyter Notebook
- The DB: [U.S. Photovoltaic Database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uspvdb/)
- How it was built
	- Was built using data from existing data projects: 
		- EIA Form 860
		- LBNL
		- EPA InSPIRE Agrivoltais
		- Maxar Satellite
	- can be extended beyond this set: updates for new 2022, 2023 sites are in progress, don't know when it will be ready. Would like to eventually get to updates 2X/year. Have funding for the next 3 years.
	- 4.7K facilities selected from 4,460 (operational as of 2021, had imagery, ...)
	- satellite images georectify plant location
		- hard to know which nearby solar arrays belong to which plants, had a given technology
			- looked at images over time, so see when stuff was built
			- looked at EIA data, which described technlogy
			- space between blobs of panels
			- many heuristics
			- 3.7K polygons was for errors by >= 2 humans, all by at least 1
		- gave confidence number about how sure boundaries were correctly found
			- mean confidence is 3.9 out of 4, so fairly confident across plants
		- tried to ID inverter location too, it sounds like
	- merge polygons, EIA data, etc. w/ land type, etc
#  Virtual All Hands Meeting
- [ ] Data needs to Mukunda
	- [ ] PV & inverter module info (talk to JonL)
	- [ ] Install information
		- [ ] location, azimuth, shading,...
	- [ ] Battery data
- [ ] PTO plans for Christmas to Nace
