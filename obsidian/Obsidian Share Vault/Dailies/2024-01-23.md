# AEMO PRICE forecast meeting w/ JonD
* Jon's points
	* both export and import matter
	* relative to each other
	* rank would help most of the time
	* would like to know if this is an extreme price or not
	* could have separate classification: is price high e.g. does hit the market ceiling or close to it would be good
	* knows that price dynamics are different in different regions
	* Jon's more curious about inputs from other regions
		* but if not ready to run opt., maybe don't focus on form of output
		* OK with it if it makes forecast easier
	* would like to see results on NSW, VIC, QL
		* one gets a lot more neg prices
		* he'll check w/ View
	* thinks it would take no more than a week to get my forecast into mkt connector (backdoor)
		* same way as doing for ERCOT
* My Q's
	* are import prices the same scaling?
		* import pay sum of market and distribution ($80)
		* many $300 dollar market prices in the data
	* how would you use rank?
		* normalize it to some price: map rank to price
		* so do calcs on a version of price
		* would chose mapping so it's smart relative to distribution prices
			* i.e. makes sense relative to average behavior
			* could train on battery discharge results from some simulation
	* sliding window normalization
		* window length must be 24 hrs
			* not a strong justification, OK w/ other lengths
		* thinks it might be better than ranks
		* agrees that get more relative price ranks
* My TODO's
	* [ ] do a default-param LGBM run on all three regions
	* [ ] proceed with the window normalization
		* 24 hrs could be a good window length start
		* I can test normalized forecast accuracy by (oracle) price reconstruction of the normalized forecasted prices
		* I could pick windows based on accuracy (JonD wasn't firm on 24 hrs)
	* [ ] talk to Amir about schedule: really 1 month?
# JonL catchup meeting
- he told me that Korea PV forecast accuracy was good enough for some mainland electrical system org, and that the next step was an island: "jujung" or something
- main idea for new site startup was clustering by geography and household properties
- I told him about my AEMO price normalization, which I'm already starting to doubt
