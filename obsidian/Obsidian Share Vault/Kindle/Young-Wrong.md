The sorting of these distinct American political identities along primal sociodemographic and cultural lines means that our “political mega-identities” become an efficient sense-making shortcut in American politics and American culture. — location: [137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BWSNRCHT&location=137) ^ref-5328
