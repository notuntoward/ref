The 2020 BLM riots were effectively manipulated by R wing media to give the impression that the Left is overwhelmingly more violent than the Right, while the truth is the opposite.  Similar manipulation is starting for the No Kings rallies on June 14, 2025 and the LA ICE/immigration protests.  The author thinks that the D's can't change this "effective framing," but they can "theoretically" make protests big enough that they can't be suppressed by Fox News (I think this is one of the mechanisms mentioned by [[Chenoweth25protest35rule]] podcast, as well as [[Chenoweth24crowdCountCnsrt]])

The BLM protests were mostly peaceful and after them, Trump's approval rating and poll numbers dropped and he lost the 2020 election (a lot of other things happened in this time).  However, constant repetition of violent BLM protest episodes on right wing media left the impression that they were overwhelmingly violent (while they were mostly peaceful) and that the Left "consistently depended upon violence," while in fact, right wing extremists have caused 20X more deaths than left wing extremists.  The Jan 6 insurrection riots actually were violent, so BLM was also an excellent whataboutism for the Rs.

Similar "effective framing" is now manipulating the LA ICE protests (largely peaceful but with some violence) as well as the extremely peaceful No Kings protests:
- right wing media has the (limited) LA immigration protest violence on constant replay
- they are not reporting No Kings protests because there was no violence "that could be elevated"
- In protest news, Fox is much more likely to use words like clash, rioting, vandalism, looting
  
The results so far are:
- 66% of Rs think the LA protests were violent (37% of Ds)
- 86% of Rs think sending the national guard and marines is justified; 10% of Ds
- independents much less fooled than Rs

Strange conclusion:
> ... little to nothing they (the Ds) can do to affect how effective Republican framing is among Republicans. 

But I think it says, the only thing to do about this is to have marches big enough that they can be seen outside of R windows.  Or, at least, I guess, keep Ds and independents informed.
