>> **Abstract**
> Background and objective: Corrective exercise interventions are often utilized to manage subjects with thoracic hyper-kyphosis, yet the quality of evidence that supports their efficiency is lacking. In this study, the efficacy of local and comprehensive corrective exercise programs (LCEP and CCEP) on kyphosis angle was evaluated.  Material and method: A prospective, randomised controlled design was used in the present study. Sixty patients with postural hyper-kyphosis deformity (⩾ 42°) entered the study for 12 weeks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a LCEP (n=20), CCEP (n=20), or Control groups (n=20). Pre- and post-participation levels of kyphosis angle were measured by flexicurve ruler.  Results: Both the LCEP and CCEP groups demonstrated statistically significant reductions in thoracic kyphosis angle compared to the control group (p=0.001). Furthermore, based on Cohen's d-value, the efficiency of CCEP was larger than LCEP.  Conclusions: Considering the extremely large effect size of the CCEP, we recommend that this program be used in the correction of postural hyper-kyphosis deformity in future.  Keywords: Thoracic hyper-kyphosis; exercise interventions; postural correction.

Study of the efficacy of local and comprehensive corrective exercise programs (LCEP and CCEP) on [[Seidi14hyperKyposisExrcsEffic.pdf#page=4&annotation=165R|kyphosis angle]] (hunchback) finds both help, but CCEP is recommended, as it has an "extremely large effect size".  These appear to have been extended to include Postural perception training in [[Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP|Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP]], where they were found to be superior to a "thoracic exercise program."
- CCEP vs. (localized) LCEP
	- I *think* CCEP has more compound exercises
	- e.g. exercise 4
		- I'm calling it scapular adduction and upward rotation, prone
		- looking at [[AboGazia20scapulaAbdAddRot]], this works both adductor and elevator muscles at the same time: "[simultaneous](Seidi14hyperKyposisExrcsEffic.pdf#page=8&annotation=177R)" as in this paper
- CCEP has five exercises (way more in [[Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP]])
	- [[Seidi14hyperKyposisExrcsEffic.pdf#page=5&annotation=159R|chin tuck, erecting the thoracic spine and adduct scapulae]]
	- Shown in: [[Seidi14hyperKyposisExrcsEffic.pdf#page=7&annotation=171R|Fig. 5. The CCEP.]]
	- There's a 5 min warmup before and after them
	- But no times given for the exercises, num. reps, etc.
- Exercise )
	1. scapular rotate, supine 
		- foam roll progression: [[Seidi14hyperKyposisExrcsEffic.pdf#page=5&annotation=213R|15, 20, 25 cm]]
	2. neck extensor and chin tuck on ball
	3. pectoral stretch, supine
		- foam roll progression: [[Seidi14hyperKyposisExrcsEffic.pdf#page=5&annotation=213R|15, 20, 25 cm]]
	4. scapular adduction and upward rotation, prone
	5. scapular adduction and downward rotation and neck extensor, sitting
##### Exercise timings/reps/durations?
This paper doesn't explain, so make exercise name guesses from [[AboGazia20scapulaAbdAddRot]] and [Appendix B](Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=12&annotation=244R) and, as well as borrow [[lit/lit_notes/Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.md#Superset  |Superset]] definitions. Guess at the stretch/self-mobilization category from the [[#CCEP Exercise Pictures]].  Foam roll info progression is also from *this* paper.

The **total time** for this single "superset" is **6.5 mins**, with no resting in between.
The complete routine of [[Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP]] is *far longer and more complicated*, and takes nearly an **hour**!
