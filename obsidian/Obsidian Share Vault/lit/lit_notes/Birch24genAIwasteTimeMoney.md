Good slide screenshot, [[Birch24genAIwasteTimeMoney.pdf#page=3&annotation=170R|“Habsburg AI,”]].

AI has "playful uses," but will consume immense and scarce capitol and energy, and disruptive societal effect.  Yet it's not designed to solve read social problems.  We need social scientists to figure what to do with it.  Good money numbers.

- ChatGPT has playful uses: [[Birch24genAIwasteTimeMoney.pdf#page=2&annotation=137R|playful uses]]
- lots of energy
- consumes capital that could be used for meaningful innovation
	- [[Birch24genAIwasteTimeMoney.pdf#page=2&annotation=155R|fivefold between 2022 and 2023]]
	- [[Birch24genAIwasteTimeMoney.pdf#page=2&annotation=158R|US$22-billion]]
- good phrase: [[Birch24genAIwasteTimeMoney.pdf#page=3&annotation=170R|“Habsburg AI,”]]: From the Tweet: [[Sadowski23habsburgAI|Habsburg AI]]
- expensive and energy intensive band [[Birch24genAIwasteTimeMoney.pdf#page=3&annotation=185R|not really designed to address actual social problem]]
- need social scientists to guide our collective decisions about it.
