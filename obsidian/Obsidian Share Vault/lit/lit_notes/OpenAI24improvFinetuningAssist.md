___
OpenAI’s Fine Tuning options.

Interesting that they offer an **Assisted Fine-Tuning** service, where AI engineers meet with customers to help find tune for their applications.

Example was SK telecom got big improvements like this and much greater customer satisfaction: 4.5/5.  

**In talk, this could be a way to alternate applications with theory**

Could have applications of genAI, ending with customer service.

Note that the initial results were bad, but OpenAI personally helped them tune it (no fee mentioned).

Then could seque into what fine tuning is.
