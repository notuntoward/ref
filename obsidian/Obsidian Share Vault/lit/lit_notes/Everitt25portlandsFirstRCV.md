%% begin Obsidian Notes %%
___

Looks like Portland’s 1st RCV election (1 winner for Maysor, multi-winner for city council) was well-liked by Portlanders, and the results were more representative of the population.  There were a lot of points but a few were

- very few made more than 6 choices
- I think 3 was typical for mayor
- Progressives ranked more candidates than others

Is this contrary to what the guy in the Capitol cafeteria told me on 2025 Lobby Day?  He said it was a disaster, that they had a lot of marginal candidates that nobody wanted (or knew how to?) pick from.  He still could be right, I guess, but it does seem to have been popular.  Maybe later, flakey winners will make Portlanders less happy with it, but for now, the majority seems happy.

By the way, the Cafeteria guy said he’d studied voting systems a lot, and advocated for something like Alaska’s system, I think, so that people had to pick from fewer candidates.  This is was one of the options we (RCV) had in our bill.  I think I concluded that the Cafeteria guy was a Republican, but I’m not sure.
