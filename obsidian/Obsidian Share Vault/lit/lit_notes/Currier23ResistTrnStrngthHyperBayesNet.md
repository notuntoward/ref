For strength, its best do heavy loads, and for hypertrophy, do a lot of sets, but anything that increases strength will likely also increase hypertrophy.  Frequency (# sessions/wk) doesn't seem to matter, all else being equal?

*I guess this is why it's commonly said that runners should do high load strength-training (for higher strength ~ higher power).  I guess lower # sets too?  But it's said older runners should train for strength not power: [[Zillen24PowerNotStrengthOldRunner]]*

When considering strength routine load, sets and weekly frequency, it's quite clear that higher loads are best for strength.  To some degree, more sets mean more hypertrophy.  

This is most clear in [[Currier23ResistTrnStrngthHyperBayesNet.pdf#page=8&annotation=1351R|Figure 4]], where high loads are definitely most associated with strength, while both high a low loads are most associated with hypertrophy when there were a lot of sets.

A "set" was when reps were done to some exhaustion threshold, either "high load" (> 80% 1RM) or "low load"

This was a meta-analysis of lots of papers with different measurements and tests.  It's interesting how they used a Bayesian network to build the probability model used to determine effect association (probability) e.g. in [[Currier23ResistTrnStrngthHyperBayesNet.pdf#page=8&annotation=1351R|Figure 4]].
