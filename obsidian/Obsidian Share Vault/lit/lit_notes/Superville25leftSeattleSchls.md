A New Survey Suggests Answers.” _The Seattle Times_, 14 Feb. 2025, [https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/why-have-thousands-left-seattle-schools-a-new-study-suggests-answers/](https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/why-have-thousands-left-seattle-schools-a-new-study-suggests-answers/).
%% begin Obsidian Notes %%
___

A Seattle example of how liberals are bad at running cities.  60% have considered disenrolling their kids for Seattle Public Schools, 86% of those because of education quality.  42% said it was b/c of changes to the “capable cohort” program for advanced learners -- I think I read a few years ago that the new superintendent wanted to cancel them because the benefited white people too much (I don’t recall that her talking about improving all students, so they could get it).  Safety was another reason (don’t know the %).

Still, oddly, 86% said they were satisfied with their experiences in the district. Seems inconsistent.
