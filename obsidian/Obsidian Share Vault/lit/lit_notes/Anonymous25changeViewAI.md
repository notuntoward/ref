>> **Abstract**
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally transforming how humans  consume and interact with information, raising pressing ethical concerns about their broader  societal impact. Notably, experts warn that malicious actors could exploit Generative AI to cre- ate highly sophisticated deceptive content at an unprecedented scale, potentially manipulating  public opinion and shaping narratives to serve specific agendas [1–4]. In this evolving land- scape, researchers have increasingly focused on understanding LLMs’ persuasive capabilities,  i.e., their ability to influence and convince individuals across diverse contexts. Early studies  on AI-driven persuasion have shown that LLMs can match human performance [5–9] or even  surpass it [10–12], including when dealing with highly divisive sociopolitical issues. Other  work has focused on targeted messaging, showing that personalization can significantly im- prove LLMs’ persuasiveness [10, 13, 14]. Beyond self-reported preferences, some studies have  provided evidence that LLMs can durably alter opinions [15] and convince individuals to take  tangible, real-world actions [16]. Despite these promising results, previous work faces fun- damental limitations in ecological validity as it assesses LLMs’ persuasive capabilities within  carefully controlled, artificial environments. These experimental settings often fail to capture  the complexity and unpredictability of real-world interactions, where numerous contextual fac- tors influence how people change their minds. Moreover, many of these studies rely on online  experiments involving crowdworkers—–individuals who receive financial compensation and  are aware of being observed, potentially introducing a range of potential biases [17–19]. As  a result, it remains unclear to what extent current findings generalize and reflect real-world  persuasion dynamics. Present work. In this pre-registered study, we conduct the first large-scale field experiment  on LLMs’ persuasiveness, carried out within r/ChangeMyView, a Reddit community of almost  4M users and ranking among the top 1% of subreddits by size. In r/ChangeMyView, users  share opinions on various topics, challenging others to change their perspectives by presenting  arguments and counterpoints while engaging in a civil conversation. If the original poster (OP)  finds a response convincing enough to reconsider or modify their stance, they award a ∆(delta)  to acknowledge their shift in perspective.
