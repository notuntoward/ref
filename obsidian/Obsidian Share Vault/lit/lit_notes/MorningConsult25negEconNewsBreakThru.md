>> **Abstract**
> U.S. Voters were 32 points more likely to hear something negative than positive about the economy last week (52% to 20%), a record low for President Trump’s second term and the worst we’ve measured since January 2023.   Roughly 7 in 10 voters reported hearing about market volatility as the electorate’s negative sentiment about Trump’s handling of the economy saw no week-over-week movement.

"Have you heard about it" and "what have you heard about it" is maybe an "issue saliency feature"?  Anyway, at about 100 days into the Trump 2nd term, 70% have heard about market volatility, and the bad to good margin is 32%: 52% have heard bad; 20% good.

- U.S. Voters were ==32 points more likely to hear something negative than positive about the economy last week== (52% to 20%), a record low for President Trump’s second term and the worst we’ve measured since January 2023. 

- Roughly ==7 in 10 voters reported hearing about market volatility== as the electorate’s negative sentiment about Trump’s handling of the economy saw no week-over-week movement.
