Harris's problem wasn't low turnout or low persuasion; it was **both** of them.  Trump made big gains among Black's, Asians, young voters, and especially Hispanics (50% voted from Trump).  The White vote remained about the same.  

Turnout-wise, if turnout had been higher, the best result for Harris would have been "no change".   The truth is that people who didn't turn out in 2024 but had voted before slightly favored Trump, they were "switchers who just didn't make the journey all the way."

> She faced a meaningful defection from the Democratic base that was partially masked by gains in new voters, and she struggled to inspire the kind of enthusiasm needed to keep marginal supporters engaged.
