>> **Abstract**
> Reductions in latent inhibition (LI), the capacity to screen from conscious awareness stimuli previously experienced as irrelevant, have been generally associated with the tendency towards psychosis. However, "failure" to screen out previously irrelevant stimuli might also hypothetically contribute to original thinking, particularly in combination with high IQ. Meta-analysis of two studies, conducted on youthful high-IQ samples. demonstrated that high lifetime creative achievers had significantly lower LI scores than low creative achievers (r(effect size) = .31, p = .0003, one-tailed). Eminent creative achievers (participants under 21 years who reported unusually high scores in a single domain of creative achievement) were 7 times more likely to have low rather than high LI scores, chi2 (1, N = 25) = 10.69, phi = .47. p = .003.

People with low ability to inhibit stimulation of some kind (low `latent inhibition`) have both a higher probability of being creative and a higher probability of psychosis.  *I believe* this study also finds that `eminiently creative` individuals have low latent inhibition too, but also a high IQ (> 120) (not sure about psychosis).  

A possible explanation is that low latent inhibition provides a person with extra amounts divergent information -- some of which originally seemed irrelevant -- and that a high IQ provides the horsepower to not be confused but to process something meaningful out of it.  
### Tidbits

- @ A high Big 5 Openness score predicts high creativity (openness was my highest score (see Evernote)), but I don't notice that I'm especially creative.
	- Openness [is also associated](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/do-people-with-a-high-big-5-op-C0A21Zf6SemiOZxd0HydPw#0) with lower latent inhibition, and at extreme levels, with psychosis, which has the same underlying mechanism
- 3 kinds of tests for creativity: interesting
- ? one test of low inhibition (I didn't quite understand it, would have to read again)
- ? metanalysis used to combine tests.  I'm not sure why they just didn't compute a joint distribution (or is that what [[Lin21evalSMDmeta|meta analysis]] is?
- ? Have to admit that I didn't quite follow the logic about the eminently creative separation, but I think I got it.  Would have to read again to be sure.
