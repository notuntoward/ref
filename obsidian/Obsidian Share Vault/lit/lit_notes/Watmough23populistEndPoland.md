I haven't read this yet but here's a good quote:

> [[Watmough23populistEndPoland.pdf#page=7&annotation=96R|Policymakers in Poland and elsewhere are on notice: both the  style  and the  substance  of policy must meet voters where they are at. The impending green transition and the need to address workforce gaps and demographic issues are vital and unavoidable policy moves. But if these policies are communicated ineffectively, and the cost of implementation falls most heavily on those least able to afford it, the forces of  populism  will have their opening.]]
