___
The fact that Trump gave up on Gay Marriage and Abortion is said to show that liberals have won.  Also, his majority was small: 231 k people in the decisive swing states.

Argument is that this worked for Trump because the voters who cared about that were also Trumpsters because of  Trump's stances on immigration, and because the R’s shifted their attention to trans people.

The “Harris is for they/them; Trump is for you.” worked against Harris.

The anti-abortionists were also unlikely to know any trans people, unlike with gay people.
