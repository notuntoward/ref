Examples of a message that is weak on its own can strengthen some other strong message.  The R culture war messages might have been weak (see other saved pages) but it was said to successfully enforce their strong econ message.  The D weak Jan 6 and pro-democracy (weak for working class) is also said to have strengthened the R strong econ message.

The argument is that the D’s lost the working class vote, especially the white working class vote because the D’s gave the impression they didn’t care about them.  D messaging prioritized things the working class considered irrelevant, or were simply hostile to, while at the same time the WC were most worried about being able to afford things. This was **grating** and made them **angry**.   Blue collar whites -- “Pro-labor, pro-life pro gun” -- abandoned the D’s.

This might be the same for some suburbs, who were really worried about schools, not necessarily the economy: Goldstein24SchoolBattlesMay  This is kind of like the Island County R vice chair, who I met while observing the Lands Commissioner recount.  Was mad about educational programs being cut, but the first thing she said was something about “pornography being taught.”

Recommendation is for D’s to “embrace a clear economic message that includes confronting corporate power and fighting to defend unions”

##### Hazy Memory of Trump’s first term

- they remembered Trump’s 1st term as a good time, economically (I’ve read elsewhere that they didn’t thing COVID was his fault, but think the D’s made it worse, I think)
- See Medina24amnesiaAboutTrump

##### Examples of misprioritization backfiring

- The R trans add was “the ultimate earworm this cycle,”
    - ended with “Kamala’s for they/them.  President Trump is for you.”
    - fired on both cylinders
        - anti-gay, or at least superfluous, silly
        - Trump has a relevant priorities
    - lost a large demog group, and pleased a tiny demog group
- D’s targeted suburban R never Trumpers
    - did get a slight bump from the target suburban areas
    - But working class doesn’t know, doesn’t care
- I would have to say that the WC is accurately perceiving my city-dwelling blue friends
- 2023 study (Lux23strategyFactoryTowns) found that a D econ. message beat R culture war messages, but an R econ message was very dangerous.
    - seems like Biden’s big Infra plans were made to address this
    - but I think, the R’s managed to successfully use their weak culture war to strengthen their strong econ message
