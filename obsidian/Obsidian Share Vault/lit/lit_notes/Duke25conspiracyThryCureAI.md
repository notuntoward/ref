AI somehow trained to refute conspiracy theories reduced them by 20%, as well as increasing intentions to ignore conspiracy-inducing information sources (social media,...) and to argue against conspiracy theories.  The effect lasted at least a month later.  This agrees with (something in Evernote where people would change their minds based on logic and evidence) and disagrees with YYYY.  There are about 70 years of attempts at conspiracy theory reduction.

The article author (not the [[Costello24durablyReduceConspiracyWithAI|researchers who did the two studies]]) thinks AI worked because it was perceived as objective, and not a threat to identity (one of the big conspiracy theory factors in [[Young23wrongAppetiteMisinfo|Young23wrongAppetiteMisinfo]] ), but doesn't give empirical evidence, other than stories of how hard conspiracy believers stick to their belies, in spite of scientific and physical evidence, and financial incentives to be change beliefs when wrong (financial analysts).
