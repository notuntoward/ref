Says something about Decoder-only Encoder-only models and what their uses are.  Dunno if this is the best article.

Mainly, is says that, in the genAI world, **“autoregressive” means “decoder-only”**, which clears up some confusion I had when reading [[Wodecki24yannLeCunDitchGenAI|Meta’s Yann LeCun Wants to Ditch Generative AI]]

- [[Gueddari23decOnlyGenAI|The Dual Worlds of Decoder-only Transformers: Training vs. Inference]] has a short and seemingly clearer explanation of decoder-only.
