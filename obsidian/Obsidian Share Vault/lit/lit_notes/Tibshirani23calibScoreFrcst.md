> **Abstract**
> In this lecture, we cover a topic that sits adjacent to conformal prediction in a sense, which is calibration. We will cover the perspective(s) on calibration from the forecasting literature, where it is arguably the most developed. Instead of focusing solely on calibration, we‚Äôll cover some of the broader theory of forecasting, pertaining to scoring rules, calibration, and ensembles. There is a rich literature on forecast scoring and calibration. This literature has roots in statistics, but over the years it has been expanded and driven by applied forecasting disciplines, primarily weather forecasting. It is still quite an active area in terms of development: new results that seem foundational in nature are still being discovered year to year. As per our usual comment, what we cover in this lecture is only a sample of what is known in the theory of forecasting. Unlike other topics, we are not aware of a book that gives a modern and comprehensive treatment of forecast scoring rules, calibration, and so on. (Perhaps this would be premature, as these topics are still in active development, and such a book will come later.) One of the most active and influential researchers in forecasting theory today is Tilmann Gneiting, and much of what we cover will be drawing from his work with collaborators, such as Gneiting and Raftery (2007); Gneiting et al. (2007); Ranjan and Gneiting (2010); Gneiting and Ranjan (2013).

> Some versions of the interval scores commonly used in conformal prediction papers are both are proper, and tightly related to CRPS and QS. ¬†But then it seems to me that the log score might be better than any of these for rare events (also see ([Taillardat et al., 2023](zotero://select/library/items/S9UBBYVG)) for more). ¬†Also, details about Bregman intervals and a lot on calibration (TODO: read that part)
> 
> ### Scores
> 
> ##### Relationship between CRSP, QS and interval scores
> 
> The interval score, IS, often used in conformal forecasting, does already both reward for sharpness and penalize miscoverage. ¬†A composite metric for a set of interval forecasts is the officially proper weighted interval score, WIS. ¬†Is WIS what I‚Äôve always computed ([‚ÄúEvalcast Docs: weighted_interval_score‚Äù, 2024](zotero://select/library/items/E8STYAAN)), but I just called it ‚ÄúCRPS?‚Äù
> 
> Anyway, CRPS can be used to define WIS/QS, but I don‚Äôt quite get that either.
> 
> Finally, this paper has a refined CRPS derivation that shows that it‚Äôs the integrated QS -- I have the older, apparently not-quite-correct derivation in energy.bib somehwere. ¬†TODO someday: find that paper and link it.
> 
> ##### Other scores
> 
> - log score (proper)
> - quadratic score (proper)
> - log score aggressively penalizes rare event underconfidence
> - but CRPS is more ‚Äúmodern,‚Äù but in DE, I found that it was not so good at rare events.
> - what about the Energy Score? ¬†TODO an link to that, as Steven V found this was better for rare events, if I remember correctly.

> ### Calibration

> ### Also
> 
> - See ([Bosse et al., 2023](zotero://select/library/items/3Q9LXI8M)) about the need to log (or something) normalize predictions before calculating CRPS/WIS on exponentially changing epedimiological data.
> - See ([Taillardat et al., 2023](zotero://select/library/items/S9UBBYVG)) for CRPS modifications which fix its weakness on assessing extreme event performance.
