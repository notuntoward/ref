Mostly about gov’t inefficiency, and failure to adopt software lifecycle, but a few AI use cases:

- in 2023 the IRS answered only 29% of the calls it received.  From annual report by the Office of the National Taxpayer Advocate. ([Rappeport, 2024](zotero://select/library/items/9C3IXQMG))
- Human-based eligibility decisions for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, have a 44 percent error rate.  Says LLMs could do better but no cite for that.
- Could have better service in:  veterans benefits, student loans, unemployment, social security and Medicare.
- Chase has 1000’s rules per business: cut redundant, contradictory by 60%: ([Tyrangiel, 2023](zotero://select/library/items/8LA3FYDH))
-  [6,392 veterans died by](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/data-sheets/2023/2023-National-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Annual-Report-FINAL-508.pdf) suicide in 2021, the most recent year numbers are available. A [ProPublica review](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-veterans-affairs-fails-mental-health-patients) of inspector general reports found VA employees regularly “botched screenings meant to assess veterans’ risk of suicide or violence; sometimes they didn’t perform the screenings at all.”
