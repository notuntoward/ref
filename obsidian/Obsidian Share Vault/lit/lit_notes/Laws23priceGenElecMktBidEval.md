>> **Abstract**
> This work presents a novel method for generating electricity price scenarios from statistical  properties of past electricity prices using a hybrid statistical and reduced-form stochastic model.  Previous work in applying stochastic differential equations (SDE) to model electricity prices has  focused on daily average prices. To extend stochastic price generation methods to hourly or sub- hourly pricing, we address several weaknesses in the state-of-the-art: (1) we replace the mean- reversion component of the SDE with an ARIMA process that is better able to characterize the  daily and weekly trends; (2) we extend the price-spike, or jump process to account for  conditional probabilities of price spikes occurring in consecutive time steps by replacing the  traditional Poisson process for modeling jumps with a generalized point process model inspired  by brain neuron models; and (3) we replace the traditional method of estimating spike intensity  with empirical variance with a Markov process based on observed price spike intensity  transitions. The method is demonstrated with electricity prices from the US ERCOT market and  a use-case example is provided for bidding an energy storage unit into the day-ahead and real- time energy markets of ERCOT using stochastic optimization methods. Results show that the  synthetic price model out performs a (naive) persistence forecast model by resulting in 24% to  47% more in profits over 168 simulated days.
