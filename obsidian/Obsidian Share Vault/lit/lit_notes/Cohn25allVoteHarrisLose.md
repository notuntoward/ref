2024 Non-voters probably preferred Trump by large margins (six estimates range from Trump +1 to Trump+20), so better (party-agnostic) turnout wouldn't have helped Harris.  This breaks a long-time assumption that voters who stay home are more Democratic, agreeing with [[Clement25demsNonWhiteVote24|Clement25demsNonWhiteVote24]] 
- Also, young non-white and irregular defected to Trump in the millions.
- Dems alienated voters they've assumed would support them but he ==doesn't say what they were alienated about.==
- Harris would have won only 72% of non-voters who were *registered Democrats!*
- Democrats had hoped to mobilize young, non-white voters to form a new progressive coalition, but those voters *swung for Trump*, and appear to be *the new swing voters* that moderates usually target
- Yet, Cohn says, a moderate message won't persuade young, non-white voters because they are dissatisfied by the status quo and want big changes
