>> **Abstract**
> Openness/intellect is perhaps the broadest, most contentious, and most quintessentially human of the Big Five personality traits. Capacity for imagination and artistic and intellectual curiosity, central components of the openness/intellect dimension, are part of what defines and advances our species. The openness/intellect domain encompasses traits ranging from intellectual abilities to aesthetic interests to potentially maladaptive tendencies. In this chapter, the authors argue that openness/intellect is at the core of the creative personality. The chapter reviews the history and facets of the construct, summarizes empirical findings regarding its relation to creativity, and differentiates the typical associations of openness (arts) and intellect (sciences) with creative achievement. The authors also discuss cognitive, motivational, and neurobiological mechanisms that may explain the link between openness/intellect and creativity.
