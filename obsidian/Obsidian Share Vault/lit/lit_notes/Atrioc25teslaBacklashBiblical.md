A jokingly vicious source for attack ads on Elon Musk personally, and on Tesla stock fundamentals, for the short-sellers.  A motherlode of lies and hypocrisy by Musk, and much schadenfreude at the fall of Musk's reputation.  Great graph showing he's now destroying the gov't agencies that were investigating Tesla, and is also protecting Space-X by trying to get more gov't biz for it. Is also quietly extracting money from Tesla and funneling it into Space-X and some AI thing that he owns way more of, and which Chinese can secretly invest in (I think it says) (and now Musk says China should have Taiwan (I think his Ukraine messages probably also please Beijing)).  Video says Musk's gov't involvement is an escape hatch, to get away from the huge, unsustainable Tesla stock bubble.

He points out that when Tesla stock crashes, your 401K in gonna crash, while Musk goes on with Space-X and other secret stuff, with little damage.

For details, clip stuff out of the YT transcript.

Interesting that China sales are down 49% or something, even though they still "think he's cool," indicating that part of the problem is Tesla's cars are getting less competitive.  But, I say, in the other 10 Tesla's biggest sales countries, the rapid decline almost certainly indicates that Musk's political acts are also the problem.

Odd: the video guy constantly laughs at his own jokes like that Russian youtuber.  Are they copying somebody or one, the other?

**Video is impressive** with the amount of facts he covers in a short time in a visually interesting way, and with his really American jokey delivery.  How does he get all that research done?  The presentation is very logical and coherent, if you pay attention to that. You can see the wheels working behind his eyes, but you have to think about that first.  He's also a biz major, and attacks the stock on that ground too (ridiculous P/E ratio, study says the value of Musk's hype is > ~$800B, while estimated true value is ~$80B, so that's why they cant get rid of him), adding to his credibility, I think.  **Really good**
