>> **Abstract**
> Background Recently, much attention has been paid to the role of neuromuscular function in long-distance running performance. Complex Training (CT) is a combination training method that alternates between performing heavy resistance exercises and plyometric exercises within one single session, resulting in great improvement in neuromuscular adaptation. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of CT vs. heavy resistance training (HRT) on strength and power indicators, running economy (RE), and 5-km performance in well-trained male distance runners.  Methods Twenty-eight well-trained male distance runners (19–23 years old, VO2max:65.78 ± 4.99 ml.kg−1.min−1) performed one pre-test consisting of: maximum strength (1RM), counter movement jump (CMJ) height, peak power, a drop jump (DJ), and RE assessments, and blood lactate concentration (BLa) measurement at the speeds from 12–16 km.h−1, a 50-m sprint, and a 5-km running performance test. They were then divided into 3 groups: complex training group (CT, n = 10), that performed complex training and endurance training; heavy resistance training group (HRT, n = 9) that performed heavy strength training and endurance training; and control group (CON, n = 9) that performed strength-endurance training and endurance training. After the 8 weeks training intervention, all participants completed a post-test to investigate the training effects on the parameters measured.  Results After training intervention, both the CT and HRT groups had improvements in: 1RM strength (16.88%, p < 0.001; 18.80%, p < 0.001, respectively), CMJ height (11.28%, p < 0.001; 8.96%, p < 0.001, respectively), 14 km.h−1RE (−7.68%, p < 0.001; −4.89%, p = 0.009, respectively), 50-m sprints (−2.26%, p = 0.003; −2.14%, p = 0.007, respectively) and 5-km running performance (−2.80%, p < 0.001; −2.09%, p < 0.001, respectively). The CON group did not show these improvements. All three training groups showed improvement in the 12 km.h−1RE (p ≤ 0.01). Only the CT group exhibited increases in DJ height (12.94%, p < 0.001), reactive strength index (19.99%, p < 0.001), 16 km.h−1 RE (−7.38%, p < 0.001), and a reduction of BLa concentrations at the speed of 16 km.h−1 (−40.80%, p < 0.001) between pre- and post-tests.  Conclusion This study demonstrated that CT can enhance 1RM strength, CMJ height, 12 and 14 km.h−1REs, 50-m sprints and 5-km running performances in well-trained male distance runners and may be superior to HRT for the development of reactive strength and 16 km.h−1RE, and reduction of BLa concentrations at speed of 16 km.h−1. Young male distance runners could integrate CT into their programs to improve the running performance.

Putting heavy weight exercises in a superset with "complex" exercise is a time-efficient way to get the running improvements associated with both.  In some ways, it's superior to doing heavy weights by themselves, for example, in greater "reactive" strength and lower blood lactate levels at speed (I think).  I don't know if the benefits are huge, but the routine looks easy, and would be a time-saving way to try out this neuro stuff.

- This is probably related to the neuromuscular work Andy O, the ultramarathoner from from Clean Power Research, did to improve his running.  
- The mechanism is possibly that heavy weight increase neural excitability, setting optimal conditions for the plyometric exercise in the superset pair.
- Improvements come with no change to body weight, fat free mass or BMI, so they are thought to come from neural adaptation.
- Conclusion says this combined routine is superior to heavy weights alone (both combined with endurance training) but I didn't dig in enough to know if those were big improvements, or ones that I care about.
- But the routine is simple, and clearly laid out in [[Li19cmplxTrainRunNeuroEcon.pdf#page=8&annotation=712R|Table 3 Strength training program during study]]
