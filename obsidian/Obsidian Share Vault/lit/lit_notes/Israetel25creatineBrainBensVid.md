___
Creatine's benefits are turning out to be low-to-moderate but significant, so they are really there -- Israetel says it'll get you a couple extra reps when you're on rep 8 or 10, and a little less fogginess when you're tired at the end of the day.  The other benefit is memory, attention  and cognitive speed -- [3-8% improvement](https://youtu.be/yatLOwL7Ncc?t=1015).

Much better results for vegans (and vegetarians I think he said too?), and especially for people over 65 ([timestamp](https://youtu.be/yatLOwL7Ncc?t=475)):

> About a "3- to 5-year rewind" in age-related recall speed for seniors; for young lifters the bump is ~"one extra item" on digit-span.

Also for people under stress, short on sleep.

Effects might be too subtle for you to notice
#### Creatine Mental Improvements
- memory (moderate), attention time and speed better
- but not
	- overall cognition
	- executive function
#### Mechanism
[Study](https://youtu.be/yatLOwL7Ncc?t=679) by EU regulators says the cognitive enhancement evidence as "insufficient" and the "mechanism is week".  But Mike says they're insanely conservative.

#### Last study
- there were five
- [start timestamp](https://youtu.be/yatLOwL7Ncc?t=783)
- 6 wks dose, then measure 6 weeks after that, so check washout affect
- found 
	- borderline small effect on working memory
	- Raven's progressive matrices test: 
		- robust deep pattern matching ability
		- no effect
#### Criticisms of studies discussed here
- small sample size
- different study designs
- not "ecologically relevant" e.g. tests on remembering numbers backwards, which is not a real world problem.
	- although he says they're *related* to real world problems
- a bias study alert on [[Prokopidis23creatineMemoryMeta|Prokopidis23creatineMemoryMeta]] 
- [[Prokopidis23creatineMemoryMeta|Prokopidis23creatineMemoryMeta]] should have been done 5-10 weeks after creatine start
	- trials only 6 wks duration (creatine needs 4 weeks before takes hold)
- washout study was too short of a washout
#### Also
- the 3-5 year bump in senior recall speed: [[Prokopidis23creatineMemoryMeta|Prokopidis23: Effects of creatine supplementation on memory in healthy individuals: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials]]

[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=0) creatine doesn't help you with reps 1 two or three but with reps 8 nine and 10 it will help get another extra rep potentially if you're really tired long
[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=7) day of work and you guys know after a day of work and towards the end of the day your boss is like "Hey do this." And you're like "Ah my brain is mush." Your brain will be less mush on creatine than
[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=16) it would be without it helping you in that last mile so to speak maybe something like I don't know half a coffee but without the jitters not terrible looks like creatine does
[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=26) something for the brain it's pretty good stuff hey folks Dr mike here for RP Strength lots of talk lately about creatine for brain gains for memory for attention for
[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=42) cognitive enhancement of all kinds what's the deal does creatine make you smarter let's find out i worked with OpenAI's 03 mega hyper super intelligence to
[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=54) aggregate a bunch of information i'm going to spill down your throat baby burn style if you just let me just let me help you i looked at four of the best literature
[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=67) reviews on the subject which take a bunch of studies together and look at all of them at the same time and for our last slot I looked at the single biggest randomized control trial a direct study
[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=79) itself on the effects of creatine on various cognitive parameters let us find out what I discovered time to get science get the lube and the tissue 3 2 1 lube tissue
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=0) first systematic review was published in 2018 by Agarinos at all and associates it was published in the journal of experimental
[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=106) gerontology which is going to be a theme because older folks seem to be a big target of creatine research nowadays the systematic review looked at six
[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=118) total trials six experiments were included with a total sample size of 281 individuals which is pretty decent they took between 5 and 20 gram of creatine per day it's kind of a lot and the
[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=131) trials were conducted for between one week to figure out acute effects to six weeks to figure out more long-term medium-term effects and short-term memory and reasoning
[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=146) had improved in creatine versus placebo in four out of the six trials which gives us an overall pulled effect size rated as small to moderate so something is almost certainly happening it's not a
[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=163) huge deal for short-term memory and reasoning but it is a deal they tested other domains things like attention span long-term memory and executive function your ability to kind of stay on on task
[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=178) and coordinate multiple things going on at the same time and those results were either mixed results where some of the studies found benefits others didn't or null where none of the studies really
[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=186) found any benefits in these studies an interesting situation occurred which is vegetarians folks that don't eat meat showed larger gains in their short-term memory and reasoning than omnivores who
[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=200) did also consume meat when the two went headto-head in trials that's curious because we know that vegetarians probably undereat creatine which in a natural diet mostly occurs from meat
[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=211) sources unless you supplement it this is going to be a theme recurring vegetarians seem to be able to benefit more from creatine than meateers which doesn't say creatine is bad for meat
[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=222) eaters it's also good but it's probably saying vegetarians really should consider creatine if not just for the muscle growth stuff but potentially for some of the brain gains as well and so
[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=232) the realworld application of this is you essentially like have a boost that's noticeable in the lab subtle in daily life but will definitely help not in a way that you can tell but
[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=249) real world you won't be able to be like "Oh I'm extra sharp today cuz of the creatine." But it will be working in the background and the effect is going to be most obvious and most helpful when
[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=258) you're in a high mental fatigue state so like creatine is similar in the brain as it is in muscles creatine doesn't help you with reps 1 2 or three but with reps 8 9 and 10 it will help get another
[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=270) extra rep potentially if you're really tired long day of work and you guys know after a day of work and towards the end of the day your boss is like "Hey do this." And you're like "Ah my brain is
[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=278) mush." Your brain will be less mush on creatine than it would be without it helping you in that last mile so to speak and you get the best effects here if you have a low baseline brain
[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=289) creatine which is to say if you're vegan often if you're female or if you're on an energy restricted diet so if you're vegan female on an energy restricted diet supplementing creatine is starting
[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=300) to look pretty awesome now what are the downsides here the caveats the takeaways or the the the sort of uh the constraints on our uh ability to conclude it's only six studies they're
[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=312) not gigantic either so it's not amazing there's a high heterogeneity of studies which is good if you want to reach broad conclusions but if you want to lens in on something actually real it's not good
[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=322) and because there's not a lot of studies in small sample sizes the heterogeneity here is not ideal um most of the tasks uh presented have what's what's called low ecological validity which means the
[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=333) task they test you on it's like here's a string of numbers tell this to us backwards and write it down really quickly you got 5 seconds to look at it 5 seconds to wait and then 5 seconds to
[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=343) write them all down that there's nothing like you do exactly like that in the real world these are tests designed to measure abstract reasoning and attention span abilities they do map on to the
[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=354) real world but not very strongly so you could be like not so great at any of these tests but still be a baller in the real world so when creatine improves these tests can we say confidently that
[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=362) it's going to improve real world intelligence and cognition not so confidently but a little bit confidently so there is room for some hope here in this situation all right that's just one
[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=372) meta analysis that was in 2018 now we  have another meta analysis from 2023 it's by Barapidius at all which I say only
[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=384) pronouncing in Russian because I think it's a Greek and good God knows how those people with their love affairs with men pronounce things in any case so this was a memory focused meta analysis
[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=394) it was done in the journal Nutrition Reviews they looked at 10 randomized control trials so 10 separate studies their combined subject pool was 404 people that's pretty decent and they
[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=406) were testing adults that were between 18 and 76 years old which is really important so you might be able to learn some things about how older folks respond here the poolled overall memory
[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=416) effect for creatine supplementation was in the low to moderate effect score category so the hedges G which is a statistical abstraction was a 27 which means that like it's definitely a thing
[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=430) that seems to work in these trials it's not crazy revolutionary but it's a bit of a big deal and the sub analysis here is really interesting adults over the age of 65 got double the benefit so
[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=445) their hedges Gcore was 0.45 which means what for over 65-year-old adults on average in these group of studies they got in their ability to recall things quickly
[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=460) a rewind of about 3 to 5 years of cognitive deterioration and old age so however good you are at about 64 years old this would rewind you back to age 60 levels of cognitive ability all things
[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=476) being equal that's a big deal for younger folks the bump is going to be like one extra item on a digit span score which means you're a bit better in memory but nothing crazy so it's nothing
[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=489) crazy for young people but something pretty meaningful though not crazy but very meaningful for seniors there was publication bias flagged not a big deal cuz the statistical treatment after
[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=500) still revealed effects but not ideal and unfortunately all of the trials were less than 6 weeks in duration and the thing is creatine in the brain takes 4 weeks to come up to its higher levels at
[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=512) which it plateaus so we actually might expect even better results if more of the studies were conducted in that 5 to 10 week range but pretty much none were some good findings here so far let's
[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=524) look at our next meta analysis this one  is from uh well I don't know how to say XU is it who at all or zu at all i have no idea chinese people let me know you
[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=535) all agree this was a broad adult meta analysis of the effects of creatine on cognition published in Frontiers of Nutrition Journal 16 randomized control trials no doubt some of the ones
[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=548) included in the other studies plus some more 492 total people analyzed which is really good ages 20 to 76 all with creatine monohydrate the most effective and vetted form of creatine
[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=559) improvements were seen in memory improvements were seen in attention time how much attention they could put to a task before they wavered and processing speed also improved
[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=572) with the biggest responders being females and folks that were 18 to 60 years old interestingly enough and clinical cohorts as well folks with
[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=584) uh fibromyalgia for example seem to respond better the real world situation here is as a creatine user you might experience something like a 5% quicker reaction
[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=597) time and uh a noticeable pop in your recall ability especially in multitask settings that fluidity of of brain and maybe something like I don't know half a coffee but without the jitters
[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=613) not terrible not terrible now the effect for memory attention time and processing speed was better but overall cognition and executive function were not significant so it's not like creatine
[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=627) boosts everything about your brain just some stuff and the effect for memory is moderate it's not high and unfortunately many of the subtrials they they did a poolled analysis but many of the
[10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=638) subtrials are quite underpowered so you know the median end size the median number of people they tested per trial was 24 people which means the probability each trial gives you an
[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=648) erroneous statement is decent so good news here some real good stuff on memory attention time processing speed nothing crazy but definitely detectable over and over in multiple
[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=659) studies looks like creatine does something for the brain it's pretty good stuff now we have our little uh number  four here our last um review of the
[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=669) evidence not its own study is the European Food Safety Authorities's scientific opinion on creatine and uh cognitive improvements published in 2024 the panel reviewed randomized control
[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=683) trials and mechanistic data so like how would this work if it did work molecule to molecule in the brain and they judged all of the evidence in total for any domain of cognitive enhancement as
[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=696) insufficient for creatine and they considered the mechanism weak damn Scott that's kind of insulting isn't it you were judged as weak that's some like that's some like 300 getting
[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=709) kicked into the pit type of in Europeans now here's the thing the European regulators basically said like "Oh cool like uh it's a nice idea but we need much
[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=721) more data to be certain about this the good news for creatine is that the European Food Safety Authority is insanely conservative you got to have a real real high bar with them to show
[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=733) that you have an effective supplement and so lots of effective supplements just don't meet the criteria it doesn't mean the supplements aren't effective it means the criteria is very high so can
[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=741) you scream at the top of your lungs to the European peoples while they're trying to club and eat sausages um everyone has to take creatine for brain gains it'll change your life no but does
[12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=752) creatine still help aspects of your cognition yes it seems that it does lastly number five the biggest randomized control trial single study in this group is by Sand Cooler at all yes
[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=766) also very European person uh Sand Cooler I know personally was smoking an elongated cigarette as he did the data analysis of the study he she I don't know well so in Europe was sort of
[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=777) beyond gender it's not very cool to talk about  123 omnivores and vegetarians and one giant pit to battle no that was a dream
[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=786) I had last night this was just them being tested to see if creatine enhanced their cognition they were given 5 g of creatine a day which is a good robust dose and the thing ran for 6 weeks and
[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=798) it was also a double blind crossover trial so they would do 6 weeks of creatine or placebo they didn't know they took 6 weeks off completely of any placebo or creatine then they did 6
[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=810) weeks of the opposite either creatine if they had placebo last time or placebo if they had creatine last time again they didn't know and then they measured at both uh pre-post pre-post so this is a
[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=820) very very robust study design and the only knock on the study design is a 6 week wash out with how long creatine takes to get into your brain and back out might be a little short but I think
[13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=829) it's pretty decent and what it showed was that working memory as measured by the backward digit span which ising really annoying test to take my OCD does not make me very good at that test
[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=840) showed that there was a borderline small effect on working memory and they also tested the uh users abilities to do the Ravens progressive matrices test a test I am personally brilliant at
[14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=854) mike uh brag more about your stupid tests okay so anyway this one time no sorry it was a joke uh Raven's progressive matrices is probably I would say the most robust test of deep pattern
[14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=867) matching intelligence abilities and it takes a long time to do it's usually not even timed they're like take take a few hours at some point you just won't be able to solve some of the problems and
[14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=877) there seemed to be no effect on the raven score so we probably rule out that creatine makes you in some deep way like smarter like if you talk to like uh if you have a like a special fancy account
[14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=887) with OpenAI they let you use the research preview of GPT 4.5 it's not going to take you to those places but on working memory it does have a small noticeable effect they did note some
[14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=898) side effects these are just regular people some people got GI upset they got bloating scott do you bloat from creatine do you get GI upset nope i feel great on I I've never met anyone who
[15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=907) actually gets these side effects yeah I I never have either yeah I can't even tell I'm taking creatine just saying completely transparent yeah um so uh these uh side effects were more common
[15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=919) than with placebo but they were also described as mild no big deal and uh it seems to be that if you uh are cognitively taxing yourself consistently really pushing your brain to the max
[15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=932) creatine might feel like a one rep upgrade in working memory not a new brain but I can use a rep here and there not bad not bad now here's the kind of complexity and this is why science is a
[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=946) mother in this best of all randomized control trials they found that there was no omnivore vegan interaction like vegans didn't do any better vegetarians didn't do any better with
[16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=960) creatine than omnivores did which a lot of the other studies do show so we still think it's an effect but this time it didn't show up which means it's probably not this enormous crazy psychotic effect
[16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=970) so across all five of these modes of  analysis which is four of the best review studies and the best randomized control trial what can we conclude about
[16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=981) creatine and the brain gains scott can you imagine like a little gif of like a little brain like but with biceps and he's like curling he's like "Yeah that's sweet." Yeah and then he's like "Man
[16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=992) should I like up the weight or should I up the trend or like what?" And then he's like "I wonder if Stacy's ever going to notice me when I get more jacked."
[16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1001) I'm just overthinking it i'm a brain you know anyway takeh homes the magnitude of creatine's effect on reaction time episodic and working memory and other
[16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1016) such subcategories of cognition is something like 3 to 8% improvement which isn't crazy it's small but it's not trivial it's not likely to be just statistical error it probably actually
[17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1030) helps those things for real at a deep mechanistic level and there are folks that can benefit probably a lot more and other folks that might benefit but a little bit less on the more benefit side
[17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1042) is people who don't eat a lot of meat or have vegan or vegetarian diets women especially when they're pmenopausal it seems folks that are in chronic sleep debt and look listen to Brian Johnson
[17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1053) don't be in chronic sleep debt if about 18 different other ways or folks that have metabolic and neurological conditions and especially older folks but if you're younger you're jacked
[17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1066) you're an omnivore and you already take take five grams of creatine per day just for the extra swollenness you can expect an uptick in your cognition but it's going to be very small and I almost
[17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1079) promise too subtle for you to notice it's still happening though but it's going to be very subtle dosing and timelines as far as if you want to take creatine to boost your
[18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1089) brain gains 3 to five grams per day though I would just go on the safe side and take five grams per day of creatine hydrate it's going to take four weeks to get
[18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1098) your creatine in your brain up to standard levels that really help the most so keep taking it you can take 20 grams of creatine per day for like a a week or two to really boost those levels
[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1108) up faster but it's going to lead to more GI distress and more wallet distress because it's a good way to piss away creatine like you should be taking creatine for months if not indefinitely
[18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1117) so just ramp up normally with 5 g per day set it forget it eventually your levels will be really good and then 4 weeks later you'll be like Superman thinking about no one's ever
[18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1127) thought about before they even thought about it that's right figure that one out so the bottom line here is this folks all jokes aside creatine is cheap creatine is safe it's already in your
[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1137) gym bag you're already using it to get jacked and it does help with that for most lifters for most of you guys it's really a why not if I'm already taking creatine or considering it for muscle
[19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1148) growth I might as well get a little brain boost and then it's an insurance policy it's awesome it's just a little bit of an enhancer kind of like going from 1080p resolution
[19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1159) to 1140p not crazy but for those adult videos you really like to zoom in on might make all the difference so does creatine boost brain gains yes is it a very small amount yes is it a real
[19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1172) amount yes so when people out there tell you creatine doesn't do for your brain they're probably wrong when people out there are trying to hawk their creatine supplement for five times the
[19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1181) normal amount because it'll revolutionize your cognition they're probably exaggerating but you know what isn't an exaggeration is that the RP Diet Coach app and the RP Hypertrophy
[19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1191) app together can not only make sweet love to you but that sweet love will result in a leaner physique a more muscular physique and you know what more happiness cuz why wouldn't you be happy
[20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1202) if you were more jacked and more lean links in the description for those digital products for you to purchase with your money and in the meantime be swell and take an extra scoop of
[20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatLOwL7Ncc&t=1212) creatine for Scott the video guy why not see you guys next time [Music]
