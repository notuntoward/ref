Seattle's cancellation of advanced math in schools is another example of lofty liberal goals followed by poor implementation and unconcern about results -- or even suppressing them.  Author says this is chronic in Seattle, similar to Defund The Police, laissez-faire hard drugs policy, and homeless encampments.  But at least SPS finally did back down on their plan, recognized failure, and adopted the more sensible approach they should have started with.

The advanced math cancellation plan eliminated advanced learning programs in schools. The idea was to make education more diverse by effectively prohibitively teaching math above grade level (according to some parents).  The idea was to "desegregate," as one virtue-signaling school board member put it, as is so common, tacitly accusing anybody who disagrees of racism.
### Results
- Hamilton middle school
	- 2016: 
		- 6 classes of geometry; one of algebra II
		- 150 students taking these classes
	- 2025: 
		- no algebra II, 1 geometry
- A Central district school, which must have been a target for "desegregation"
	- 2019
		- 60% students of color
	- 2025
		- 78% students of color
		- 102 fewer students
		- Asian enrollment dropped by 50%
- Citywide
	- Asian enrollment dropped by 17% since 2019
### Excuses and denial vs. reality
- Seattle School Leaders
	- denied that families might be pulling out of school b/c of schools
	- claimed that if enrollment was falling it was because of high housing costs (*similar to how homelessness is always blamed solely on high housing costs*)
- The truth ([[Kornahrens25enrollmentSPS]])
	- families "overwhelmingly" said they left b/c of school quality and curriculum
	- *only 3%* cited cost of housing
	- majority of current students were considering leaving b/c of academic quality
