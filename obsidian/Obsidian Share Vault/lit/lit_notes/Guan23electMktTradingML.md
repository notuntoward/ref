> **Abstract**
> Renewable sources have placed themselves as the preferred energy source while consciousness is growing about the environment, climate change andhealthimpacts of fossil fuel. In addition to these,renewable energy is also becoming cheaper to generate and store, blessedby the advent of modernmanufacturingmethods and scaleups. Renewable energy sources arebecominga financially viable alternative,not just aniche application. Energy Information Administration (EIA, USA) forecasts that from present to 2050, renewable energy will remain the fastest growing source of energy [1]. The Electric gridmodels are also undergoing changes to address this changed landscape. Many large scale energy farms as well as households are participatingin this complex energy delivery mechanism. This has ushered us into the smart grid. Smart grid allows for more data and insights into energy generation/consumption, andhas opened the door for application of more statistical tools and forecasts. Energy data arenow harvested at more granular levels, and with the proliferation of AI/ML, the gathered data cannow be utilized for forecasting more effectively. When it is viewed from the grid-level transmission and distribution perspectives,the available data and computationalpower allow all stakeholders to re-think the market dynamics.
