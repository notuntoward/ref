How an entrepreneur uses ChatGPT w/ Obsidian.  Mostly this is about Obsidian as a GTD for hooking together all your apps -- folders/notes/PARA or whatever.  But a little about GPT theory, GPT for learning Spanish, and a couple interesting ideas about Obsidian.
## Word probability display on chatGPT website
- [00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1220#t=20:19.58) chatGPT setup for showing word probs (shows temperature, colors for probs) 
- [00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1263#t=21:02.64) text colors indicate probs of next words
- [00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1300#t=21:39.88) says it's doing what we do: "how do I know what I think until I hear what I say?"
- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1387#t=23:07.07) it's mining our thinking, and reflecting it back to us
- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1401#t=23:21.15) shows how to play w/ "frequency penalty", etc, and see what regen does **good for demo talk**
- [ ] try this out, see if it gets more certain as it goes on
- [ ] [00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1568#t=26:07.92) he says he has a youtube video on setting this up: **look for it**
## chatGPT as a language learning tutor: templates chatGPT commands and system prompts.  *Interesting!*
- [00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1657#t=27:36.67) chatGPT MD is the plugin he uses
- [00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1683#t=28:03.09) templates spec chatGPT params, system_prompt ("system_commands")
- [00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1725#t=28:45.28) does Spanish translation on selected text and *explains the grammar*
- [00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1792#t=29:51.98) he moves the note the template it creates to some repository (of spanish lessons, in this case)
- [00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1824#t=30:23.61) templates for generating a blog in his style, etc
## What to do w/ old notes in old progs when you move to Obsidian
- [00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1881#t=31:20.58) how to start: drag all your files (old word files, pfs, exported Evernote, etc.) put it in his archive dir and then gradually move the stuff to where you eventually know where it goes (not chatGPT specific)
- [00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=1992#t=33:11.59) alternatively, could run old progs side-by-side w/ obsidian, and export gradually
- [00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=2019#t=33:38.84) *don't* try to look at ALL old notes, best to bundle it up and only retrieve what you remember (and I hope, need)
## Break up projects: Infinite discrete art studios, infinite kitchens
- [00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7iU-QCbrqg&t=2118#t=35:18.47) Da Vinci had separate studios for big art projects, left them set up w/ tools.  Equiv: and "infinite number of kitchens".  So, set up Obsidian like that w/ discrete project areas you can enter and leave easily
