Practical tutorial and review of some Obsidian plugins, and an argument that Obsidian is a great platform for trying all kinds of AI, but it seems to be mainly .  I'm pretty interested in the Smart Connections plugin, as it looks like it might a subsitute for the old Evernote note recommender.  Also, the note Q&AQ w/ source attribution could be good.

# Raw Notes
- Built in Obsidian
	- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=118#t=01:57.51) In obsidian, you can click on a tag embedded in a note, and it will search for everything w/ that tag.  I did not know!
## [[2024-04-11#Smart Connections plugin]]
- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=158#t=02:37.86) : smart connections plugin setup
- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=194#t=03:13.68) embed Jina as local model
- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=213#t=03:32.67) embedding only 34 notes takes a while....
- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=219#t=03:39.40) use chatGPT for actually processing the notes, I think
- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=233#t=03:52.96) sidepane shows most similar articles to the one you're on.  Nice, 
	- calls this "embedding similarity"
- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=275#t=04:35.40) chat with notes.  You ask it questions, and it generates an answer.
- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=311#t=05:11.39) can copy this to a note -- sound like a [[Gen AI Talk Ideas#AI data self-pollution]] disaster!
- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=333#t=05:33.18) but shows the chunks (context) of your notes, which were used to support the generated answer.  Nice
- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=339#t=05:38.74) clicking an eye icon puts all the details of your notes in collapsible quote blocks, 
	- somehow shows which part of response came from that chunk, I think?
	- [ ] ? would these copies in a note also be [[Gen AI Talk Ideas#AI data self-pollution]]?
- obsidian internal plugin page says pdfs "coming soon" (4/12/24)
## [[2024-04-11#Text Generator plugin]]
- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=377#t=06:16.50) Text Generator Plugin
- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=390#t=06:29.61) is more a command driven approach
- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=406#t=06:45.87) more open than smart connector
	- OpenAI centric, I think he said
	- But he uses chatGPT for text generator demo
- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=438#t=07:18.35) type the prompt directly into a note, 
	- a bit slow to start, 
	- then it pastes an answer into the note
	- **I don't like this!**
- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=484#t=08:03.94) but can put it in a chat bloc (callout) that's got an "AI" title on it
	- still, it's going to scan this
- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=503#t=08:23.17) Excalidraw (his favorite tool on this list)
- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=521#t=08:40.77) AI settings, just like the others
- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=536#t=08:56.13) install some 'excal AI' script, which generates code
- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=589#t=09:49.07) can generate a website based on your drawing
- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=619#t=10:18.83) It's not too bad, has styles, filled in names, etc.  A good mockup
- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=654#t=10:54.10) can copy out the html that it made for the website
## [[2024-04-11#Autocomplete plugin]]
- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=721#t=12:00.85) there's "autocomplete" coming from some tool
	- I'd hate this, and it's not maintined anymore
- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=757#t=12:36.81) 
## [[2024-03-23#Note Refactor Plugin]]
- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=770#t=12:49.77) Note refactor plugin (he loves it)
## [[2024-04-11#Languagetool plugin]]
- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=782#t=13:01.52) languagetool plugin
## [[2024-04-11#Matter plugin]]
- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=791#t=13:10.96) matter plugin: highlights of "articles", goes into your notes, but I'm not sure what was highlighted
## [[2024-04-11#Dataview plugin]]
- [00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=824#t=13:43.70) loves dataview
## [[2024-04-11#Booksidian plugin]]
- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=837#t=13:57.39) Booksidian: pulls goodreads book (lists?) into Obsidian
## Conclusion
- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=865#t=14:25.30) Obsidian lets you leverage AI w/o forcing you to always use OpenAI or whatever
- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr0H8nudgE&t=882#t=14:41.73) says Claude is "awesome these days" See [[Morrison24ClaudeTopGPT4|Claude takes the top spot in AI chatbot ranking â€” finally knocking GPT-4 down to second place]]
