Some kind of prob ramp forecaster and plotter.

# Perplexity [claims](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-there-a-tool-for-visualizin-.ieGocbySWCfqC4Bv5C5vw#1) it does the following:
The RAVIS tool integrates renewable energy forecasts into its visualizations through several key mechanisms:

1. **Site-Specific Solar Power Forecasts**: RAVIS incorporates site-specific solar power forecasts to provide detailed insights into the expected generation from solar resources. These forecasts are updated at a high temporal resolution (e.g., 5-minute intervals) to ensure accuracy and timeliness[1][2].

2. **Net Load Forecasts**: The tool also integrates net load forecasts, which represent the total load minus the contributions from wind and solar power. This helps in understanding the overall demand that needs to be met by other generation sources[1][2].

3. **Market Simulation Data**: RAVIS includes data from market simulations, such as nodal market clearing prices, transmission line utilization, and available generation flexibility. This data is crucial for understanding how renewable forecasts impact market operations and pricing[1][2][5].

4. **Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasts**: The tool provides probabilistic time-series forecasts, which include uncertainties in the renewable generation forecasts. This allows operators to assess the range of possible outcomes and prepare for different scenarios[2][5].

5. **Ramp Event Alerts**: RAVIS generates alerts for significant up or down ramps in renewable generation. These alerts help operators anticipate and manage sudden changes in generation, ensuring grid stability[2][5].

6. **Spatially Resolved Forecasts**: The tool offers spatially resolved forecasts, showing renewable generation predictions for specific sites and regions. This granularity aids in localized grid management and planning[2][5].

By integrating these diverse data streams, RAVIS provides comprehensive situational awareness, enabling grid operators to make informed decisions based on the latest renewable energy forecasts and market conditions.
