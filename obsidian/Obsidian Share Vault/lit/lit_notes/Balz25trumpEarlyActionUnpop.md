___

A couple months after Trump took power is net unpopular and it seems that is actual actions are even more unpopular than he is -- and Musk is a big negative.

Musk is one of many tack vectors the data in this article suggests.

- [ ] # Go through it rank attack vectors, as well as things that Trump gets good marks for e.g. some parts of his immigration policy (but by no means all!).  
	- e.g.
		- Musk ties within universal  resentment of rich
		- Of near-term interest is the widely held opinion that congressional R’s won’t stop Trump from breaking the law
			- and (from this article), many would not improve if Trump did, I think it says
			- would seem to be a great 2026 attack angle, since conservatives are supposed to want law and order
			- countintuitively, conservatives could be convinced that cutting of huge numbers of IRS workers is bad
				- R's want to make it **easier for the rich to cheat** while you do pay your taxes.
				- and for corporations to cheat you (see [[MorningConsult25agencyCutsFewSupport|MorningConsult25agencyCutsFewSupport| CFPB cuttability]]
