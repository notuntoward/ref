> **Abstract**
> Few states are as red as Iowa, and yet the legendary Iowa pollster Ann Selzer found that Kamala has leapfrogged over Trump to take the lead there. The turnaround is due to women—particularly women 65 and older, who previously tilted toward Trump, but now favor Kamala 63% to 28%. Iowa's new strict abortion law could be a factor. J. Ann Selzer joins Tim Miller for a special Sunday pod.  show notes Des Moines Register story on the Iowa Poll: https://www.desmoinesregister.com/sto...

> An example where weighting demographic poll response counts in order to match statewide demographic may make the underrepresented voter problem smaller?  If groups are _over_-represented it's because they're more likely to vote.  She doesn’t love the “recall vote” correction.
> 
> Anne Seltzer’s famously accurate at getting outliers that are correct Iowa poll doesn’t explicitly correct for voters who are underrepresented because they are unresponsive (don’t answer the phone).  However, she has something the could possibly reduce the problem, or at least, this is explanation she gave when asked about it:  She collects demographic stats for all poll respondents who have already voted or who say they will definitely vote (her definition of “likely voter”), and then, at the state level, she weights the group count totals so they match the known statewide distribution of those demo groups.
> 
> In this video, [Tim Miller asks Anne Seltzer](https://youtu.be/P-ysKh_Gyd0?t=450) how she handles the artifact pointed out by the NYT’s Nate Cohn, where “older voters who are Democrats are more likely to answer.”  She explains the statewide demo weighting above, but when pushed says she doesn’t explicitly correct for non-responsive , , but emphasizes that groups who are over-represented after correction are over-represented b/c they're more likely to vote. She doesn’t like the “recall vote” correction method explained in e.g. ([Cohn, 2024](zotero://select/library/items/N733ZT8K))
