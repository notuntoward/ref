>> **Abstract**
> This paper investigates the growing role of emotions in shaping policy views. Analyzing social citizens' media postings and political party messaging over a large variety of policy issues from 2013 to 2024, we document a sharp rise in negative emotions, particularly anger. Content generating anger drives significantly more engagement. We then conduct two nationwide online experiments in the U.S, exposing participants to video treatments that induce positive or negative emotions to measure their causal effects on policy views. The results show that negative emotions increase support for protectionism, restrictive immigration policies, redistribution, and climate policies but do not reinforce populist attitudes. In contrast, positive emotions have little effect on policy preferences but reduce populist inclinations. Finally, distinguishing between fear and anger, we find that anger exerts a much stronger influence on citizens’ policy views, in line with its growing presence in the political rhetoric.

___
People are angrier since 2013 (20% increase); anger best at affecting policy views (towards either right or left wing policies); pos. emots. slightly reduce populism.  Anger much more effective than fear. 

- [ ] ! authors say requires change in poly sci, which used to explain political movements by demographic groups, geography, union movements, ...  they say not it's organized by `emotional communities`.  Read to find this.
- [ ] ? is there an ML way to detect emotional communities?

I didn't read more than the abstract.
