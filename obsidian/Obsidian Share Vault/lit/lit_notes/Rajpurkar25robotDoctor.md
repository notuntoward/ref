The best AI medical team might have humans as AI feature generators (or the other way around) with humans as an AI post-processor.

Current AI, could save time and increase accuracy by safely removing obvious “healthy” X-rays from a radiologists workload.  It’s bad at diagnosing patients by Q&A, but good and analyzing Q&A done by human doctors. Humans would apparently be valuable at converting AI treatment suggestions into the final treatment plan, given a patient’s circumstances.

At least for Xrays, current AI is better than humans, but acting in tandem with doctors, there is almost no improvement (92% accuracy for AI, 72% accuracy for humans line, 76% for tandem)  But AI is bad at asking humans diagnostic questions: in some unidentified clinical situation, AI accuracy was 63% when it asked the questions and 82% when it was given apparently human-supplied Q&A.  AI is also a good Xray screener: for mammograms, it could reliably ID screen out about half of normal Xrays, leaving the more complicated cases for human diagnosis: 20% breast cancer detection with half the radiologist workload.
