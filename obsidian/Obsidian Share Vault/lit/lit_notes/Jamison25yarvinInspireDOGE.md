Curt Yarvin, a Silicon Valley North Star for DOGE staff and many other Trump plans, wants to destroy democracy and replace it with benevolent dictators.  JD Vance has signed on, and influential DC MAGAs are is acolytes.

CHe wants the world broken into a 1000 small governments, ideally run with no attention to the opinions of the people, ideally by one person.  He's disavows some of Trump's actions -- especially DOGE -- but researchers say it's clear that the problems they cause aren't because of poor implementation but of the ideas themselves.

Stunning quote from JD Vance:

> “There’s this guy, Curtis Yarvin, who’s written about some of these things,” Vance said on [a right-wing podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMq1ZEcyztY&t=1620s) in 2021. He went on to offer his advice to a then-hypothetical President Trump in his second term: “Fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, and replace them with our people. And when the courts — ’cause you will get taken to court — and when the courts stop you, stand before the country, like Andrew Jackson did, and say, ‘==The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.==’”
