> **Abstract**
> Generative AI has captured our imagination and is transforming industries with its ability to answer questions, write stories, create art, and even generate code. AWS customers are increasingly asking us how they can best take advantage of generative AI in their own businesses. Most have accumulated a wealth of domain-specific data (financial records, health records, genomic data, supply chain, and so on), which provides them with a unique and valuable perspective into their business and broader industry. This proprietary data can be an advantage and differentiator for your generative AI strategy.  At the same time, many customers have also noticed the rise in popularity of vector datastores, or vector databases, used in generative AI applications, and are wondering how these solutions fit in their overall data strategy around generative AI applications. In this post, we describe the role of vector databases in generative AI applications, and how AWS solutions can help you harness the power of generative AI.
