>> **Abstract**
> OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of donepezil combined with rehabilitation training for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its impact on nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). METHODS: This single center retrospective analysis was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical and Pharmaceutical College and included 184 patients with AD treated between January 2022 to May 2024. Of them, 92 patients who received donepezil combined with rehabilitation training (combined group) were matched in a 1:1 ratio with a cohort that received donepezil alone (donepezil group). The treatment efficacy, cognitive function, ability to engage in daily living activity before and after the treatment, serum NGF and BDNF levels, and incidence of adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The total efficacy of patients in the combined group was higher than that of the donepezil group (P<0.05). After the treatment, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and activity of daily living (ADL) scores of patients in the combined group were significantly higher than in the donepezil group (P<0.05). In contrast, the combined treatment method was associated with considerably lower Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores (P<0.05). Patients who received the combined treatment had significantly higher serum NGF and BDNF levels than those treated by donepezil alone (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with donepezil alone, the combination of donepezil and rehabilitation training is associated with significantly improved therapeutic effects and better serum NGF and BDNF levels.

Donepezil works by itself ([[lit/lit_notes/Yi25donepezilRehabCombo.md#^l027|or does it?]]) but it's more effective when combined with [[Yi25donepezilRehabCombo.pdf#page=2&annotation=242R|rehabilitation training]]: what might be called "cognitive training" plus some [[Yi25donepezilRehabCombo.pdf#page=2&annotation=265R|motor function training]] (not exercise, but breathing and stuff).  This is in terms of daily living, less cognitive degradation, and doesn't aggravate any donepezil side effects (actually found slight decrease).

- [[Yi25donepezilRehabCombo.pdf#page=4&annotation=295R|Fig.1: Comparison of cognitive function and activities of daily living]] shows that
	- Donepezil by itself Alzheimer's effect (ADAS-Cog) and improves measures of daily living
	- Donezepil + Rehab is  more effective (statistically significant and a squidge better than donepezil by itself)
- ? Does Donezipil by itself work or not?  Doesn't Fig 1 show that it does? ^l027
	- This paper says that [[Yi25donepezilRehabCombo.pdf#page=5&annotation=307R|numerous  studies  show  that  single-drug therapy cannot significantly alleviate the progression of AD]]
	- It also says this paper is [[Yi25donepezilRehabCombo.pdf#page=5&annotation=310R|confirming that the effect of oral administration of donepezil alone on daily living function and quality of life of AD patients is limited]]
- Combined treatment  [[Yi25donepezilRehabCombo.pdf#page=5&annotation=313R|slightly reduces adverse reactions  donepezil or at least doesn't aggravate them.]]  NotebookLM (I think) says this wasn't significant but my quick scan of this paper didn't find that in this paper.  
- Increased brain chemicals [[Yi25donepezilRehabCombo.pdf#page=5&annotation=324R|NGF]] and [[Yi25donepezilRehabCombo.pdf#page=5&annotation=330R|BDNF]], have known neural benefits
