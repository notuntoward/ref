Not a great writeup, but it does list some use cases and some embedding designs, namely Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, Top2Vec, BioVectors.  Look these elsewhere, along with how they are used.

Word2Vec description is too unclear to be useful.  The main things unanswered is what are the actual inputs and outputs of the NN, and where are the embeddings read off?  Seems the embeddings might be from the inside of an autoencoder, but who knows?

Similarly Vague

[[SwimmTeam24Tword2VecHowWork.pdf#page=9&annotation=512R|Top2Vec]]
A topic detector.  Not too clear.

[[SwimmTeam24Tword2VecHowWork.pdf#page=11&annotation=548R|BioVectors]]

Not clear what this was predicting.  But it uses a Word2Vec, trained on domain-specific bio corpora.  Uses are gene discovery, drug repurposing, predicting protein interactions
