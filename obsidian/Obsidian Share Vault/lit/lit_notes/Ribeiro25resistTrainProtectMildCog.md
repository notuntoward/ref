>> **Abstract**
> Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to cognitive alterations with preservation of functionality. Individuals with this diagnosis have a higher risk of developing dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical exercise, are beneficial for the cognition of this population. However, the impact of resistance training (RT) on the brain anatomy of older adults with MCI has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to investigate the effects of RT on cognition and brain anatomy in MCI. Forty-four older adults with MCI, 22 in the training group and 22 in the control group, were evaluated in neuropsychological tests and magnetic resonance imaging at the beginning and end of the study, which lasted 24 weeks. We used repeated measures ANOVA. The training group showed better performance in verbal episodic memory after intervention. The control group showed a decrease in gray matter volume in the hippocampus and precuneus, while the training group showed no reduction in the right hippocampus and precuneus. However, it showed a decrease in the volume of these regions on the left side and in the left superior frontal gyrus. In the analysis of white matter integrity, fractional anisotropy increased in the training group and decreased in the control group. Axial diffusivity decreased in the training group, while radial diffusivity increased in the control group, and mean diffusivity varied according to the tract evaluated. RT improves memory performance, positively influences white matter integrity parameters, and plays a protective role against atrophy of the hippocampus and precuneus in MCI.

Weight training improved verbal episodic memory in adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment to the extent that, at the end of six months of training, five of twenty-two test subjects no longer had mild cognitive impairment -- and none of them had lost memory-related brain volume vs. the control group, who had.  Several brain structure metrics also showed improvements, or lack of degradation, as seen in the control group.

Benefits like this come from any physical exercise, so it's not clear to to me how weight training compares to aerobic exercise in this regard. However, [[Ribeiro25resistTrainProtectMildCog.pdf#page=3&annotation=166R|other cited studies say that increased muscle strength is correlated with improved cognitive functions and a reduced risk of Alzheimer's.]]

#### Moderate to High Exercises In 
From paper: [[Ribeiro25resistTrainProtectMildCog.pdf#page=3&annotation=209R|Resistance Training Protocol]] (over 6 month testing period)

- **Two sessions/week**
	- 1 hr. duration each
	- done in mornings

- **Session**
	- **Three sets/session**
	- **1 min rest between sets**
	- **One set** (large muscle group exercises)
		- Exercises in set (alternate between upper/lower body)
			1. leg extension
			2. chest fly machine
			3. seated leg curl 
			4. lat. pull-down
			5. leg press
			6. seated row
			7. hip abduction machine
			8. standing calf raise
			9. reverse crunch
			10. sit-up
		- Ten repetitions of each exercise per set
			- load for each rep. is 80% of `1-RM` (1 rep max, max amount you can lift once)
			- load increases over time, as `1-RM` increases with training
				- [[Ribeiro25resistTrainProtectMildCog.pdf#page=4&annotation=957R|1-RM retested at 12 wk intervals]]
		- upper/lower body pair order chosen randomly at each session
