Guy says the D's must stop ranking and prioritizing people by the level of marginalization.

- has led D's to unpopular positions that were also wrong 
	- on crime, immigration and education.
	- non-white people
		- Asians 
			- Asian's had to pass much higher bars to get into schools than both blacks and whites
			- D's tried to abolish emissions exams, where Asians excelled
			- tried to remove advanced math courses to "level" the playing field 
				- [ ] ? didn't they actually do this in Seattle?
			- Result: Asian voters swung hard against the Ds 
				- [ ] ? I have a note on this somewhere, and I remember that they did, but not super-hard)
		- "diverse cities"
			- D's focus on criminals as marginalized people allowed high crime, a lot of disorder
			- The negative affects fell harder on non-whites in "diverse cities"
			- "diverse cities" swung harder against the Ds than whiter suburbs
		- Latinos
			- foreign migrants aren't citizens
			- "Biden administration presided over the entry of millions of migrants into the country in a way that was not in accordance with any intentionally enacted public policy" 
			- Some of the hardest-against-D swinging counties were Latino, on the US-Mexico border
		- BIPOC: "Black, Indigenous, and people of color” puts Latinos and Asians on the wrong end of the marginalization hierarchy.  And (I guess?) some knew it.
- **What to do**: change what you stand for, and stand up to the obsessive race categorists
