>> **Abstract**
> The representationof public preferences in public policy is fundamental to most conceptions of  democracy. If representationis effectively undertaken,we would expect to find a correspondence  between public preferences for policy and policy itself. If representation is dynamic, policy  makers should respond to changes in preferences over time. The integrity of the representational  connection, however, rests fundamentally on the expectation that the public actually notices and  responds to policy decisions. Such a public would adjust its preferences for 'more' or 'less' policy  in response to what policy makers actually do, much like a thermostat. Despite its apparent  importance, there is little research that systematically addresses this feedback of policy on  preferences over time. Quite simply, we do not know whether the public adjusts its preferences  for policy in response to what policy makers do. By implication, we do not fully understandthe  dynamics of representation. This research begins to address these issues and focuses on the  relationships between public preferences and policy in a single, salient domain.

Explains the form of the regression equation used in [[Wlezien95publicThermostatSpend|Wlezien95: The public as thermostat: Dynamics of preferences for spending]].  That paper gave this one a pub. date of 1995, but looks like it was actually published in 1996.
