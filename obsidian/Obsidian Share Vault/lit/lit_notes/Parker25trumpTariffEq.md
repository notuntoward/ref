Explains the Equation Trump Admin used to compute Tariffs.  Equation "derivation":  Calc the percentage of tariff change, $\Delta \tau_i$ for country $i$, needed to **decrease consumer demand in the US** so that the trade deficit.  This says nothing about tariffs, so there's not tariff "reciprocity," as the Trump admin claims.   

From [here](https://youtu.be/j04IAbWCszg?t=312):
![[image-1.png|512x284]]

Anyway, this equation requires that you know $\psi$, the fraction of the tariff passed to the consumer, and $\epsilon$, the elasticity of demand.  The paper the Trump admin used for justification is **actually nonlinear** and far more complex than this, and the Admin arbitrarily picked $\psi$ and $\epsilon$ so they'd cancel, giving the equation used.  They say they did that because it would be complex if not impossible.

But they didn't even use it!
- if it was positive, they [divided by 2](https://youtu.be/j04IAbWCszg?t=719)
- if it was < 10%, they made it 10%
- Even if the US had a *surplus* (so the equ. was neg.) [they still got a tariff increase!](https://youtu.be/j04IAbWCszg?t=719)

Aside from the fact that
- a surplus is not always good, and a deficit is not always bad
- it makes no sense to apply a country-wide tariff with these equations when US exports (aircraft) are totally different than imports from, say [New Zealand](https://youtu.be/j04IAbWCszg?t=854) (Wine).

He also hates the use of `*` for  for multiplication, and the fact that they have a [sign error](https://youtu.be/j04IAbWCszg?t=428), but they bodged this by defininig $\epsilon < 0$. He says they're writing this equation (but in a bad way) go give "mathiness" to their arbitrary approach.

The [average tariff (weighted by imports) is 41%](https://youtu.be/j04IAbWCszg?t=982).  By their logic ($\psi = 0.25$) , this means that this is equivalent to a [10.25% tax on all imports](https://youtu.be/j04IAbWCszg?t=1011). (although [Trump said Americans won't have higher prices](https://youtu.be/j04IAbWCszg?t=1030) but China, etc. will).
