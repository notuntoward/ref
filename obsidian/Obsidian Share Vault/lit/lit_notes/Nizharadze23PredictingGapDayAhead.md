> Predicting the price gap between the day-ahead Market (DAM) and the real-time Market (RTM) plays a vital role in the convergence bidding mechanism of Independent System Operators (ISOs) in wholesale electricity markets. This paper presents a model to predict the values of the price gap between the DAM and RTM using statistical machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks. In this paper, we seek to answer these questions: What will be the impact of predicting the DAM and RTM price gap directly on the prediction performance of learning methods? How can exogenous weather data affect the price gap prediction? In this paper, several exogenous features are collected, and the impacts of these features are examined to capture the best relations between the features and the target variable. An ensemble learning algorithm, namely the Random Forest (RF), is used to select the most important features. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used to capture long-term dependencies in predicting direct gap values between the markets stated. Moreover, the advantages of directly predicting the gap price rather than subtracting the price predictions of the DAM and RTM are shown. The presented results are based on the California Independent System Operator (CAISO)’s electricity market data for two years. The results show that direct gap prediction using exogenous weather features decreases the error of learning methods by 46%. Therefore, the presented method mitigates the prediction error of the price gap between the DAM and RTM. Thus, the convergence bidders can increase their profit, and the ISOs can tune their mechanism accordingly.
