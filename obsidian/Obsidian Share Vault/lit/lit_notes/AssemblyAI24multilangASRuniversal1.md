Good graph: “This is a chart of the Average Word Error Rate of AssemblyAI's Universal-1…”

Interesting points about new ASR, put in the “multilingual, translation” part, maybe next to OpenAI’s multilingual voice generation [[David24OpenAIVoiceCloning]].  Possibly before the part where I say that LLMs are multilingual, and have made the point about transformers, and call centers?  Was that why the S Korean phone company got so much better results ([“Introducing improvements to the fine-tuning API and expanding our custom models program”, 2024](zotero://select/library/items/VLKXDN9V)), or was that a text-only job?

- Really good numbers
- multilingual
- English no longer best (“I used to be an ASR researcher, and English used to be the best, but now Spanish is best, while German and French are comparable.  Would love to see other languages…)
