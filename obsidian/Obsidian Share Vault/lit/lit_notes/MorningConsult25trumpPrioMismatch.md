The biggest gap between what voters think Trump *should* prioritize and what they think he *is* prioritizing is Tarrifs: 29% more people think he's overdoing it.  The general gap theme is that voters expected Trump to attack rising costs and inflation (this "dominated" his campaign) and he is actually spending time on other things.

Is 29% actually a politically significant gap, given that nearly half of the country voted against Trump?  I don't know, but in close elections, tiny shifts do matter -- that is if the shifts are from people who aren't already on your side.

- ? Does Morning Consult distribute results with layering by political orientation, gender, age, location, etc?

This could be a gap dashboard, pared with how much media is covering these things, or how aware people are them could could be a [[Politics/Political Causality/US Elections 2024.md#Salient hypocrisy tracker |Salient hypocrisy tracker]] providing ammo for attacks.
