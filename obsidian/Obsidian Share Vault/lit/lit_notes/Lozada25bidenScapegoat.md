Biden's catastrophic 2024 candidacy was due to Democratic groupthink and conformity.  Many Ds knew of Biden's incapacity but did not object, threatened critics and even lied to Biden about it his own polling.  The public knew better.  Steamrolling Harris in as a replacement candidate was also a misfire because she wasn't a great candidate, and avoiding a primary also avoided a healthy Dem party policy debate.  The result is that the public doesn't trust the Ds, and the Ds are unable to present them with a solid case of what they stand for -- only that they are against Trump.

### Tidbits
- Biden's decline began when Beau Biden died, and reached an "inflection point" during Hunter Biden's legal troubles.
- Logic for Biden
	- "stick with a flawed and deteriorating candidate precisely because his victory is essential"
	- "if we admit that we can’t run the country, they won’t let us run the country"
- "What Biden and his team did not seem to grasp was that the campaign was becoming a referendum on Biden alone and that *<u>two numbers — the price of groceries and the age of the candidate</u>* — were moving in the wrong direction."
- Joe and Jill stayed in the race for selfish reasons.  Also spite against Obama (allegedly)
- Aids lying to Biden: 
	- "Donilon continued to tell him that the polling remained tight, that Biden was still competitive, even when the campaign’s pollsters disagreed"
	- "When Schumer told Biden in mid-July that the president’s pollsters believed he had only a 5 percent chance of winning, Biden had a one-word response: “Really?”"
- Harris not up to the job
	- "Biden’s advisers did not fully trust her,” Tapper and Thompson write, considering her too cautious, reluctant to take on politically tough assignments and overcomplicating simple ones."
	- "Ahead of a Washington dinner party with journalists and socialites, the authors report, Harris aides were so anxious that they held a mock party with members of her staff playing the role of the guests."
- Dems won't win if they simply scapegoat Biden
	- "easier to find a scapegoat than an identity. But self-definition is a critical challenge for a party that must offer something more than fervent anti-Trumpism, however crucial resistance feels today"
