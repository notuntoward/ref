Gen Z (19-29,I think) voted for Trump +14, a while their enthusiasm has dampened since he took office, their net approval is still +7 (vs. -24 for same-aged women, on YouGov).  That's the biggest gender gap across demos, but not the biggest pro-Trump demo, which is middle-aged men (+13).

### Why Soem theories:
- it's a backlash against feminism -- MeToo, etc., male pathologizing, etc.
	- [ ] # more info: [American Institute for Boys and Men](https://aibm.org/)
- young males are doing poorly compared to young men: 
	- lower academic achievement
	- more likely to live with parents
	- more opioid and suicide deaths
	- worse off than their fathers (Young men in low income households)
- Polarization by smartphone and alt-right podcasters
	- [ ] # more: [[Evans24techSplinterCulturalCtrl|Evans24: The Great Splintering: How Digital Tech Shattered Cultural Control]] 
- They like Trump's style: brash, machon, makes them feel welcome
# Yet maybe policy will eventually matter?
- overall men's policy preferences haven't changed much over the years (not specifically young men, but overall)
- Trump's policies seem unlikely to improve the state of young men
- hint: YouGov poll shows a recent dip in young men's Trump approval; Post-Ipsos poll now shows them neutral on him
