> **Abstract**
> Ranked choice voting (RCV) is an increasingly popular electoral
institution that has been posited by reformers and media outlets to
produce transformative eﬀects on elec- toral outcomes and
representation. However, there is little social scientiﬁc evidence
available that evaluates these claims. I test the eﬀects of RCV on
municipal ﬁscal out- comes and the ideological composition of city
councils. I also estimate RCV’s eﬀects on these outcomes relative to
public opinion—in other words, whether RCV narrows the gap between
outcomes and mass policy preferences. This article ﬁnds no empir- ical
support for the proposition that RCV changed ﬁscal outcomes or the
ideological composition of city councils—both on absolute terms and
relative to mass opinion. Fur- thermore, the roll-call based ideal
points of legislators serving before and after RCV did not change, and
the relationship between city district opinion and city legislator
ideology is unchanged post-adoption. Taken as a whole, this article
does not ﬁnd evidence that RCV has produced the types of
transformative political eﬀects that reformers have postulated.

No evidence for [[Ranked Choice Voting]] enhancing ideological moderation and policy responsiveness (and other stuff?), according to [[Morris25rcvFailOKpollBias|Morris25rcvFailOKpollBias]] who also says that it caused [[Drutman23updateRCVview]] to drop RCV support
