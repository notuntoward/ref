___
Tesla sales down a small amount in WA and in the US.  Far below drops in UK and DE (other articles)

- Evidence of WA  drop?
	- KUOW reported that Feb. Tesla sales were down 35% over Feb 2024 (don't say what happened to other cars or EV brands).  
	- before 2025, Tesla sales were "more than half of WA EV sales" but were 46% in Q1 2025.
- WA EVs: 20% of new vehicle sales are EVs in WA
- US Teslas: Q1 2025 sales down 9% from last year, so maybe they're down more in WA than in the rest of the US (comparison difficult b/c different time periods)
