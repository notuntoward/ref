This was a podcast largely about a focus group of 2020 Biden voters who didn't vote in 2024.

- Dems saw polls showing "democracy" was a salient issue, so the put some priority on it ([Longwell says](https://youtu.be/X2K7H6ZKuec?t=1839))
- Problem: a lot of that concern came from R's who thought the election was stolen, and so they weren't buying talking points from the D "stealers"
- This was given as a reason for why focus groups matter: they can clarify meaning
- [Longwell says](https://youtu.be/X2K7H6ZKuec?t=1899) Ds also screwed up by being "conservative" on comms -- I think this meant keeping Harris out of many public appearances.
- But she also that this is *the thing the have to figure out*: how to be good communicators
	- **Psaki** kind of agrees, Ds don't talk like real people
	- they don't pick "human" things they do
	- says they always want to sound the smartest (kind of true, but I'd say more "correct")
	- Psaki says "stay on message" or "answer the question you want to answer" is terrible media advice, as people see through it.  Wants candidates to say what they actually think, the way you'd talk to friends.  Don't be afraid to piss people off.
		- both did used to give this advice 15 years ago, but think that was a different time
- Both agree Harris did as well as possible, sort of agree the problem was Biden
- What 2024 focus group non-voters said about Harris
	- didn't 'know' Harris
	- Harris choice seemed like a "desperate effort"
	- A Seattle voter said she wasn't compelled, lived in a Blue state
	- Black guy didn't like her prosecutorial history 
	- Live interviews were bad, but now regrets not voting
	- 4 months wasn't enough time to see her as Pres
	- Her approach was gimmicky, reaching out to "all these factions" was not relatable to majority of Americans
	- Didn't like her positions on Gaza
	- Didn't like that she was always appointed to her positions
- Longwell and Psaki said about what they've heard
	- The quality, less the magnitude, of celebrities matters
		- a lot of black voters didn't like all the celebrities e.g. Megan The Stallion, or Beyonce (who "ain't paying my bills")
		- Longwell: thinks people don't think Taylor Swift doesn't know anything about politics, but they *do think* or did think that Elon Musk does, Psaki agrees.
			- also RFK Jr., Joe Rogan were considered more relevant
		- Psaki says the celebs got people out in big numbers, got them to register, etc. so there's a tradeoff, but risk of "jumping the shark."
- Psaki on Harris
	- thinks attention lost on Cheney took away from other topics that might have been more effective: another tradeoff
- "defense of rights" took up too much attention: "what I will do for you" would have been more effective
- Walz: "he disappeared for months" and Psaki thinks he was effective, underused (I think she meant)
- Do something right now
	- Both agree that the Ds should be running right now, less risk-averse
	- They both love Ds going to red districts to do town halls right now
- Longwell points out that these people were "shaking with anger" at Trump, but *didn't vote*!  
	- there was a general feel that Ds were "weak and woke"
- Psaki says "senority" focus in the Ds is killing the party (more or less), besides that they don't know how to talk.
- Coming up:
	- effort to extend high end tax hikes (not popular)
	- another funding fight in the fall
	- D's need to be getting out now
- Longwell says Musk is very unpopular (no number) than D's in congress (21% approval)
- More focus group
	- D's spent too much time arguing about pronouns instead of what people care about.  But this guy was really well-read, so maybe this is just what he was told.
	- they want fighters like Jasmine Crockett (but she's too young still)
	- want Ds to be more progressive, like Squad, Bernie, and Jayapal
	- one guy wants a non-politician, CEO
	- Longwell says: people have opinions on people who are out there talking
	- they want a fighter (which Psaki says make them feel good)
- Longwell says people need a frame, Ds need to "put stuff on the table,: ideas. 
- Psaki: people are tired of Ds attacking, want to know from Ds what they will do about it
- Longwell: people need to "see themselves" in talking points:  Americans see themselves in "America first," they see themselves in "Working people," because they work.
- Psaki: Ds are missing Social Security: Trump, Musk are saying terrible things about it, and Ds aren't capitalize on it.
- Longwell: Ds are paralyzed because they now believe that `#resist` was "bad" and now are afraid to do anything
