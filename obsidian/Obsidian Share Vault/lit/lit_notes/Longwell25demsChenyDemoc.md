___
- Dems saw polls showing "democracy" was a salient issue, so the put some priority on it ([Longwell says](https://youtu.be/X2K7H6ZKuec?t=1839))
- Problem: a lot of that concern came from R's who thought the election was stolen, and so they weren't buying talking points from the D "stealers"
- This was given as a reason for why focus groups matter: they can clarify meaning
- [Longwell says](https://youtu.be/X2K7H6ZKuec?t=1899) Ds also screwed up by being "conservative" on comms -- I think this meant keeping Harris out of many public appearances.
- But she also that this is *the thing the have to figure out*: how to be good communicators
	- **Psaki** kind of agrees, Ds don't talk like real people
	- they don't pick "human" things they do
	- says they always want to sound the smartest (kind of true, but I'd say more "correct")
	- Says "stay on message" or "answer the question you want to answer" is terrible media advice, as people see through it.  Wants candidates to say what they actually think, the way you'd talk to friends
