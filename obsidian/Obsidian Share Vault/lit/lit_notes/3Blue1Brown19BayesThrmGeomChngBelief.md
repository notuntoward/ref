Visual review of Bayes Theorem and Bayesian updating.  Nice.

## A handy visual

This is the famous Kahneman/Tversky farmer or librarian example, where the evidence `E` is that the person is shy and retiring.  The hypothesis you're to predict the probability of, `H` is that the person is a librarian.  There are way more farmers than librarians in the population, so almost all of the square enclosing the total population is farmers.  Even though `P(E|H) = 0.4`  and `P(E|~H)=0.1` (librarians are more shy than farmers), there are way more farmers, so if you see a shy person, the probability that this person is a librarian increases -- this is a `Bayesian evidence update` -- it is still much smaller than the probability that this person is a farmer, simply because there are so many farmers.
### Notation & Terms:
- P(E): `probability of the evidence` (here of anybody being shy)
- P(H): `prior`, the prob. of the hypothesis (here, being a librarian)
- $\neg$: `not`
- P(H): `prior` probability of the unconditional probability of the hypothesis (1/21)
- P(H|E): `posterior`, the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (shy)
- P(E|H): `likelihood`, a backwards posterior, prob of evidence given hypothesis (0.4)
## How question phrasing matters

People instinctively fail to consider that probabilities multiply, not recognizing that it's less likely that a person belongs to two subgroups than just one.  For example...
### Told this

Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.

### Asked: Is Linda a bank teller and feminist?

### If instead asked to count...

â€¦ then 0% got the answer wrong.

I guess this is why you often hear science communicators say "40 out of 100" instead of 40%?

## Simple Bayes Derivation: Counts or Proportion's
