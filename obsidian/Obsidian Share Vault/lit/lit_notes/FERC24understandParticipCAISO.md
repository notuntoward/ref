CAISO, one of 7 US ISOs in US, runs wholesale, large generator to electricity reseller market for 80% of CA & a bit of Nevada.  It handles XX minute day-ahead markets, and 5 minute RT markets, making demand forecasts for both (RES too?), handling demand response, and dispatching to compute prices.  Of the two markets, utilities mostly use the DA, to limit price risk.
# Points
- "wholesale" is what CAISO manages, is mkt between generators and power resellers
- "retail" is power sale from reseller to end user
- CAISO runs
	- Mostly high voltage transmission, including outside of CA
	- Realtime mkt
		- "immediate" power needs
		- every 5 mins
		- makes a RT demand forecast
		- [ ] ? who makes RT RES forecasts?
		- dispatch
	- Day-ahead mkt
		- "next day"
		- [ ] ? every ? minutes?
		- makes a DA demand forecast
		- [ ] ? who makes DA RES forecasts?
		- [[FERC24understandParticipCAISO.pdf#page=4&annotation=2294R|utilities meet most of their needs through DA, reducing price risk]] ^gpq2
	- Demand response
		- accepts bids from large customers to reduce their usage
		- can have a big impact on emissions
- # Things that affect CAISO Market Prices
	- ? demand (net, after RES?)
	- line congestion
	- plant outages
	- disaster
	- extreme weather
- CAISO doesn't have committees
	- A 5 member board, appointed by gov., decides
	- But the public can attend (most) meetings, comment, etc.
