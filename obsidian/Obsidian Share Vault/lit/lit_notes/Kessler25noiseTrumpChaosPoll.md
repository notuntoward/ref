>> **Abstract**
> Democrats have a historic and almost unprecedented opportunity to flip what appeared to be Trump’s strongest selling point into his chief liability on all things economic if Democrats separate the signal from the noise, use the right messages, avoid the wrong ones, and are relentless.

Best attacks on Trump are prices/econ, gov't cut safety risk, digital privacy risks and tariffs.  14% of Trump voters seem persuadable. Slides and article.

Trump's early actions are unpopular but even though voters think he's been worse than expected, his job approval ratings aren't horrific: 48-51% approve/disapprove.
Still, 14% of Trump voters are "soft and movable," tested messages reduced Trump approval: vote change not tested.

- Trump most vulnerable on breaking promises to middle class on econ and costs
- Immigrant mass deportation more popular than Trump himself!  54/43% approve/disapprove
- Defending Gov't: focus on specific, popular items: cancer rearch, vet progrs, SocSec, nuclear safety,...
- Musk is "box office poison", may also be a digital privacy angle against him
	- -16% favorable, all voters, but only 20% of Trump voters view him unfavorably
	- DOGE unpopular -11% favorable, unusual since gov't reform usually popular
- Taxes more salient than inequality?  
	- Rich guy tax cuts stronger than Rich guys "enriching themselves": Cutting taxes on billionaires and corps is unpopular, but "Trump enriching himself and his billionaire supporters didn’t poll as well "
### Messages that changed Trump-sympathetic Voters the Most
- test 17 messages; only 4 moved the needle, but they were *much* more effective
- the young, the non-college, and women more most moved
- characteristics of successful messages: **"hit close to home" or fail a morality or competency test.**
- Successful messages
	1. prices and economy
	2. safety risk due to gov't cuts
	3. digital privacy
	4. tariffs
