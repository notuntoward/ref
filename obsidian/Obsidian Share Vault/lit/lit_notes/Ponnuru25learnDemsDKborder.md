In 2024, voters prioritizing immigration were slightly more likely to vote Trump and those prioritizing abortion were slightly more likely to vote Harris.  But 2X as many voters  prioritized immigration.  

DK also had an immigration backlash, but the Left there moderated in order to preserve social trust, and to maintain support for the welfare state.  

Argument here is that the D's should also moderate.  They also shouldn't assume that anybody who wants stricter control of illegal immigration is ignorant or a racist, but may have legitimate concerns.  Also, if immigration policy matched voter opinions, it would not be brutal as the D's fear: the median US voter want asylum restrictions but opposes deporting all undocumented immigrants.
