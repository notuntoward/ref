>> **Abstract**
> Undoubtedly, evolving wholesale electricity mar- kets continue to provide new revenue opportunities for diverse  generation, energy storage, and ﬂexible demand technologies.  In this paper, we quantitatively explore how price uncertainty  impacts optimal market participation strategies and resulting  revenues. Speciﬁcally, we benchmark 2-stage stochastic pro- gramming formulations for self-schedule and bidding market  participation modes in a receding horizon model predictive  control framework. To generate probabilistic price forecasts,  we propose an autoregressive Gaussian process regression  model and compare three sampling strategies. As an illustrative  example, we study a price-taker generation company with six  unique generation units using historical price data from CAISO  (California market). We show that self-schedule is sensitive  to the error in the forecast mean, whereas bidding requires  price forecasts that cover extreme events (e.g., tails of the  distribution). We benchmark realized market revenue against  optimal bidding with perfect information and ﬁnd static bid  curve, time-varying bid curve, and self-schedule modes recovery  95.29%, 94.85%, and 84.87% of perfect information revenue,  respectively.
