___

Musk uses slang, references, and imagery that are popular in the online world of video gamers, and (said to be) influential tech workers. It's tribal -- they're part of the revenge of the nerds -- and Musk uses it to bond with them.  It seems that they're conservative, anti-woke, anti-MSM, and are feeling their oats e.g. Gamergate.

When Musk communicates this way, he's seen as "authentic," as was Trump, when he tweeted incessantly in his 1st admin.  So again, "authentic" means "speaks my tribe's language."

It also seems like Musk's videogame references are a lot like Trump's ridiculous Superman posters and so on.  This makes that Trump stuff make more sense.

But I guess Musk is a little too imprinted on his first internet experiences, which seem to have been in 2010, and there may be a rising sense in Musk's internet circles that he's getting out of touch, or as they say, that he "fell off lowkey."
