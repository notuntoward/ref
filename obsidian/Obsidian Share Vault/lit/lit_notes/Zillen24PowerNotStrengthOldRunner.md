>> **Abstract**
> You get slower as you get older. One reason behind this is that your muscles are not able to deliver power in the same way as when you are younger. But the fact is that you don't lose as much in strength and muscle volume as you lose in muscle power. You lose more in power than strength. In this video, you'll learn the difference between training for strength or power or muscle growth, what the different terms mean, and what you as an older runner can do to prevent the decline as best you can.   __________________________________________________  Fredrik Zillén is an running technique specialist that has over the years helped thousands of runners to a more efficient running technique - from the slowest beginners to members of the Swedish national team in running and triathlon who have participated in the World Championships and the Olympics. Fredrik also writes articles on effective running technique for Runner's World magazine.   Following the success of Fredrik Zilléns online course in Swedish, he has also produced an updated and improved version in English. You can find it here: https://www.fredrikzillen.com You find the Swedish version at: https://www.fredrikzillenonline.se  "Fantastic running course. Fredrik is an excellent teacher with a unique approach. I highly recommend this course to runners of all levels." Kevin, UK  "The best money I have ever spent. Great mix of humour, practical technique and theory. It’s brilliant and I have been telling all my friends about it. I’ve knocked 30 secs off my average pace to 4:30 and at 53 I’m absolutely astonished how relaxed I feel running. It’s also really helped my cycling my adapting similar techniques and visualisation. Thanks so much." Paul, UK  "Just wanted to say Im 2/3 through your running program and WOW what an insane difference". Runner, Texas, USA  ”I have done the first two audio lessons now. It's amazing what a difference you made for me. I ran 90 minutes yesterday and have never felt so fresh both during and after the workout, and then I have never run so fast with the same low heart rate. Thanks for that!!” Update from a runner after two of the six audio lessons  I can honestly say it is some of the clearest and best instruction I have ever recieved in any topic. After a year of shin splints I went for a run yesterday and was almost in (joyful) tears because I had zero pain, so thank you!! Andrew  ”I can't thank Fredrik enough for putting his running course out there. I couldn't run more than 3Km without my calves straining - within two or three videos, he'd got me running properly, and I'm now happily running half marathons. Your course is one of the best "fitness money" choices I've made. Money well spent!" John, UK  ”I got your online course and it almost instantly fixed my running form. I can prove that by having half an hour faster marathon finishing time.”  Runner, Indonesia  "I knew nothing about running other than put one foot forward in front of the other...and fast. Then I signed up for his course. Mind blowing!... and too cheap if you ask me. Totally recommend it." Runner   ”Oh my goodness!!! This is an absolutely FANTASTIC course !!! Ive always struggled to enjoy running......pains in knees, calves, hip flexors......it wasnt pretty. Then I found this course and was astounded at how much my running improved after each lesson and with less effort than I was using before. Im now kicking myself for wasting time bumbling around with random techniques when I could have gone straight to the expert!” Kerry, Australia    Read more testimonials here: https://fredrikzillenonline.newzenler...

___
I really do need to to power training.  Maybe jumps and other plyometrics (although kettlebell swings might be enough? ([[Lake12KettlebellSwingExplPow.pdf]]))

With age, you don't lose as much in strength and muscle volume as you lose in muscle power. You also lose more in power than strength. Strength training is still important, but guy also recommends plyometric types for reducing power loss.  I think power loss is also associated with falls (did he say that here?).
