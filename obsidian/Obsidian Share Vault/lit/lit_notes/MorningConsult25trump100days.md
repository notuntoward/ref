A clear visual (graph) of politization in voters' views of the economy.  When their guy is in charge, they think the economy is better; the other guy winning is an economic disaster.

R sentiment fell off a cliff around the time when Biden took office in 2020 and then shot up like a rocket when Trump took charge in 2025.  D and I sentiment dropped at the same time (must have been the COVID market crash), but the Ds recovered quickly, and was above what it had been during Trump's 1st term.  Around the start of Trump's 2nd term, it dropped to the lowest on this graph.

I sentiment fell in 2020, recovered a small amount and hasn't changed a huge amount since then, although they did follow the same, slow rising trend from 2022 to Jan 25 that the Rs and Ds also followed.
