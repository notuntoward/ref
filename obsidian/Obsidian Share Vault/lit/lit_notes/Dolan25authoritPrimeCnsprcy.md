[[Thomas25authoritPrimeCnsprcy|Short study]] in US and NZ suggests that belief in conspiracies doesn't cause authoritarianism, but rather, authoritarians are predisposed to believing conspiracies.  An increase in conspiracy beliefs didn't cause a change in attitudes towards gov't.

In general, conspiracy beliefs were associated with both support for authoritarianism and support for direct democracy: ideological opposites!  But perhaps both are attractive to people who are dissatisfied with traditional democracy.  Is this how former Dem, Joe Rogan ends up supporting Trump?

Study done with a "random intercept cross-lagged panel model," which I guess is a "A couldn't have caused B because A occurred after B" method for eliminating the possibility of a causal effect.  Interesting.
