Far fewer now think 27% BLM worked than those who thought it would in 2020; BLM support dropped very sharply in 2020 and has continues to drop (violent campaign reaction?) since; Blacks are discouraged about their changes for improvement.  Yet opinions on police behavior have nearly recovered to their 2016 levels (not stellar, but significantly better than in 2020).  A plurality think Trump makes race relations worse, but huge polarization on this between Rs and Ds.

### Did/Will BLM Work
- 27% now say has worked (in 2020 52% thought it would)
- BLM support dropped from 67% to 52%
- 49% now thinks Blacks won't achieve equality (39% in 2020)

### Police
- Approval for police has recovered to just below 2016 levels in 3 categories

![[image-11.png|375x442]]
- 87% say Black/police relationships are same or worse as before Floyd

### BLM Support
- Rapid drop in BLM support: 67%  in Jun 2020 to 55% in July (?) 2020; continued drop: 52% now
- But support remains high among Blacks, Democrats and young adults

### Attention to Race
- opinions on the amount of it are unchanged
- Ds are much more "angry" or "fearful" about it than Rs
- Rs are much more "uninterested", "hopeful" or "satisfied" than Ds
### Gone far enough of racial equality
- not enough: 49% in 2020; 43% now, so a small drop
### Trump's handling of Race
- Trump makes it worse (48% worse vs. 28% better)
- Bid difference between Rs and Ds
