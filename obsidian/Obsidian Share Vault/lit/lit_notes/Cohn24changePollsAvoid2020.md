Many changes to 2024 polling may reduce the Trump presidential vote underestimate of 2020, but it's possible that the infrequent, unengaged voters who show up for presidential races — and especially for Trump — will still be underrepresented.
### Changes to 2024 Polling
#### Data Collection
- A move from phone sampling to randomized address mail sampling
- [Online probability panels](Lau23compareProbPanelsPoll): recruit by randomized address, [not clear](Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=3&annotation=475R) if better at getting Trump voters
- [Benchmark Surveys](Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=4&annotation=499R): large surveys that pay a lot to respond (see [[Lau23compareProbPanelsPoll|Lau23compareProbPanelsPoll]])
	- used to correct e.g. R/D balance in smaller, lower quality polls
	- [[Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=4&annotation=519R|30 percent response rate]] in Pew Benchmarks vs. 3% i similarly high quality polls.
#### Recall Vote Weighting
- weights R/D respondents by (inverse of, I think) [R/D balance in 2020 election](Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=5&annotation=547R)
- used by about [2/3 of 2024 polls](Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=5&annotation=553R), was avoided by 2020 gold standard pollsters
- respondents [[Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=5&annotation=565R|likelier to recall voting for the winner of the last election]]; recall weighting will somewhat correct that
- corrects the [[Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=6&annotation=590R|too many highly engaged voter]] liberal oversampling problem
- Not loved by famously correct Iowa Pollster: [[Miller24harrisDominate|Miller24harrisDominate]] 

#### New Data
- 2020 had [[Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=7&annotation=720R|highest- turnout modern race]], which didn't match pollster's historic expectations; for 2024, 2020 is now in their training data.
- In 2020 early mail voters (both R and D) were more likely to vote against Trump; 2024 pollsters now used different weights for people who say the voted early.
- In 2020, many Trump voters weren't registered as R's; now [[Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=7&annotation=654R|Trump supporters have gradually been registering as Republicans.]]
#### Pollsters Coming and Going
- many bad pollsters will skid the presidential race in 2024 e.g. [[Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=8&annotation=660R|Monmouth]]
- [[Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=8&annotation=675R|Three Democratic firms]] are producing far fewer polls (so I guess they'll show up less in time-weighted averages?)
- [[Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=8&annotation=702R|Many more nonpartisan]] pollsters this year
- the R/D balance of 2020 pollsters [underestimated Trump by 4.2 %](Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020.pdf#page=8&annotation=711R); Extrapolating to 2020, the underestimate is **3.2%**. So less but still not eliminated.
### Also
- [[Lau23compareProbPanelsPoll|Lau23: Comparing Two Types of Online Survey Samples]] : online probabilistic panels seem 2X more accurate than opt-in surveys, but still may not represent unengaged voters.
