> **Abstract**
> In the United States, an independent system operator (ISO) controls and monitors the operation of the electrical power system within a given perime- ter. In California, CAISO also acts as the electricity market operator. In this project we focus our attention on the day ahead market (DAM) for electric- ity. This market takes place one day prior to the operating day and consists of scheduling the quantities and marginal electricity prices (wholesale) for each hour. We will denote p ∈ R24 the DAM price for a given day. The marginal clearing price corresponds to the intersection between the supply and demand curve: these curves are formed by CAISO who receive bids from all the market participants (essentially: electricity retailers, gener- ators, and virtual bidders). Figure 1 gives an overview of the DAM market process, while Figure 2 illustrates the obtainment of the market clearing price for a given hour. CAISO has the specificity of having different clearing prices based on lo- cation, this is done with the purpose of including externalities of electricity losses (around 6% on the transmission grid [6]), and electricity congestion in the final price [7]. All in all, the clearing price in the DAM is specific to a location (or node), and is referred to as Local Marginal Price (LMP). It is essential for a market participant to be able to predict the DAM price before submitting it’s bid to CAISO. That is why in a first step we decided to build a prediction model for the DAM price (average price in the system, not the LMP). It is also important for the market participant to understand the underlying risk when making a bid: that is why we studied the error between our prediction and the realized price. In a second step, we examined and visualized the LMP behavior, which is particularly interesting if we want to understand the local market power an agent can have.

Apparently class project report on CAISO price prediciton using simple statistical models.  Interesting b/c an intro to basic mkt behavior, solves a convex optimization problem, and clusters nodes.
