>> **Abstract**
> Donald Trump won back the Oval Office and took charge of the government amid the strongest poll numbers of his political career, but as the 100-day mark of his presidency approaches, Americans’ views of what he’s done so far have turned deeply negative, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds.

___
Trump has bad 100 day poll: similar to other other 100 day polls e.g. [[Balz25trumpApprovSink]].  Has nice graphics showing decline.  
# Identity Politics and out-of-touchness
One interesting tidbit: of issues tested, Trump's approval is positive only one: trans and gender identity
- "51% approve of his handling of that matter, including 90% of Republicans, 48% of independents and 16% of Democrats."
	- CNN video shot on this poll is good ([timestamp](https://youtu.be/VbUkYqp3dXI?t=115)):
	  ![[image-5.png]]
	 
- Kind of coincides with another 100 day poll ([[Balz25trumpApprovSink|Balz25trumpApprovSink]]) which shows Trump losing on every issue except immigration, 
	- but the Ds still being considered a little [more out of touch than the Dem Party and trust Trump more than congressional Ds](<lit/lit_notes/Balz25trumpApprovSink.md#News not good for Ds, though >).
