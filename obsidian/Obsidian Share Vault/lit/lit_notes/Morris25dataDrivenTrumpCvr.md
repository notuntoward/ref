>  Morris, G. Elliott. Interview with Michael Podhorzer about a Data-Driven Approach to Covering Trump. 13 May 2025, https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/interview-with-michael-podhorzer.

A discussion between a data-driven journalist, E. Morris, and a long-time commentator, M. Podhorzer, a little before the election.  There are some misses, like their belief in the importance of abortion (I think it turned out to not be the most important thing in 2024), and the rule of law/democracy. But there was also cost/benefit of populism and poll following. 

I listened to this during a workout, and wrote down a timestamp where I remembered there being some juicy poll results about Trump policy vs. policy statements but I couldn't find it (I thought it was 36:40)
### Popularism plusses and minuses (for Democrats)
i.e. focusing only on issues perceived as most popular (by polling, I guess) and downplaying less popular ones.
#### Minuses of Populism
1. hard to know what's really popular [[lit/lit_notes/Morris25dataDrivenTrumpCvr.md#^3qtn |[00:20:00]]] 
2. you're always worried about saying wrong thing, not bold or inspiring [[lit/lit_notes/Morris25dataDrivenTrumpCvr.md#^cnbi |[00:20:19]]]
3. politics also about values and identity, not just policy [[lit/lit_notes/Morris25dataDrivenTrumpCvr.md#^2h63 |[00:20:34]]]
#### Plusses of Populism
1. corrective to left-wing politics completely indifferent to public opinion [[lit/lit_notes/Morris25dataDrivenTrumpCvr.md#^jxkb |[00:20:55]]]

### Video Transcript: Interview with Michael Podhorzer

**Host:** G. Elliott Morris
**Guest:** Michael Podhorzer

[00:00:00] **G. Elliott Morris:** Hello and welcome to the G. Elliott Morris podcast. I'm your host, G. Elliott Morris. Today I'm talking with Michael Podhorzer. He is the former political director of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the United States. He's also a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and an advisor to the Analyst Institute. For a long time, he has been a leading voice on electoral strategy for Democrats. Michael, welcome to the podcast.

[00:00:26] **Michael Podhorzer:** Thanks for having me, Elliott.

[00:00:28] **G. Elliott Morris:** So, I just gave a very short introduction there, but maybe you could talk to our listeners a little bit about your background and the work you do.

[00:00:36] **Michael Podhorzer:** Sure. Well, you covered the high points, but I think the thing that is probably most relevant to the conversation we're gonna have is that I spent 25 years at the AFL-CIO running their political program. I was very lucky to have gotten there at a time when the labor movement was investing a lot of new resources in politics and particularly in data and analytics. And so, during the course of a 25-year career there, I got to both build a pretty robust political program and then see the whole field of data analytics in politics grow from its infancy to where it is now.

[00:01:21] And, you know, it was just an incredible perch because we not only got to innovate things on our own, but we're at the table with all the presidential campaigns and all the other major players in the progressive ecosystem. So it was a great way to kind of learn about how politics works or doesn't work, which I guess will be the subject of our conversation. And then I think maybe just the other piece is that my background is as an organizer, as a community organizer, a labor organizer. So I kind of brought that perspective to the political work as opposed to a communications perspective or a campaign manager perspective.

[00:02:08] **G. Elliott Morris:** Right. And you're now at the Analyst Institute, you're a senior fellow there still, right?

[00:02:18] **Michael Podhorzer:** I'm an advisor there.

[00:02:20] **G. Elliott Morris:** Advisor.

[00:02:20] **Michael Podhorzer:** Yeah, the Analyst Institute is an organization that the labor movement helped found in the mid-2000s to basically take all of the experimentation that was going on in politics and put it in one place and professionalize it. And now it has a huge experimental program and is a repository for all the experiments that get run by progressives in politics. So I've had a long relationship with the Analyst Institute and that's just a great place for me to kind of keep up on what we are and are not learning about what works and doesn't work in politics.

[00:02:57] **G. Elliott Morris:** So let's talk about that a little bit, what does and does not work. You have a term that you use to describe the reaction to polls and to, you know, other sorts of political analysis that I think is pretty apt. So let's define "the freakout" for our listeners.

[00:03:16] **Michael Podhorzer:** So "the freakout" is something that I think a lot of people who are listening to this podcast have experienced personally over the last couple of election cycles. And that is this period, sometime in mid-October when polls start showing a tightening race and Democratic prospects dimming. And this is particularly acute for people who work in politics for a living. And so you get this flood of texts and emails and Slack messages about how we're blowing it and what we're doing is not working and we have to do something different.

[00:03:59] And this has been a feature of, I would say, the last, I don't know, half dozen cycles or so. It probably started, you know, in the modern era in 2016 when people had this certain sense of confidence about the outcome of the election and then were shocked when it didn't turn out that way. And ever since then, people who follow politics closely have had a bit of PTSD and have reacted very anxiously to any piece of data that suggests that things aren't going their way.

[00:04:40] And the thing is that that anxiety isn't just a personal failing. It actually affects the political discourse. So when there's a freakout, you see it on cable news, you see it in the headlines and the ledes of stories in our major news outlets. You certainly see it on Twitter, although that may be less of a thing now. And the problem with the freakout is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, right? It's like a run on a bank.

[00:05:15] And so I wrote a piece for the *New York Times* in 2022 that got a lot of attention, but I didn't actually coin the term “freakout” there. I coined it in a piece that I wrote in 2020 on my Substack, which is called Weekend Reading, in which I detailed this phenomenon. And there had been a freakout then. There was a big freakout in 2021 around the Virginia governor's race. And then, as I said, the mega freakout of 2022, which I think kind of set the stage for where we are now.

[00:05:51] **G. Elliott Morris:** It seems like there's a component of the freakout that is related to the people who are involved in politics, right? The types of people who are paying attention to polls in mid-October or even in, you know, June of the year before the election. These are not your average voters. So it feels like there is both, like you say, a supply of this discourse, right? There are people on cable news, there are journalists who are writing these headlines, but it feels like there's also a demand side for it as well among the political hobbyists and other people who are just chronically online. Does that seem right to you?

[00:06:27] **Michael Podhorzer:** I think that's definitely right. I mean, I think that the number of people who care about polls has certainly grown, you know, I think that the *New York Times* needle was kind of the beginning of that. People got very addicted to that. And then, you know, outlets like yours or *FiveThirtyEight* or, you know, have brought polling to the masses in a way that just wasn't true before. And so, yeah, I mean, I think the demand for it is quite high and also the stakes of our elections have grown. I think people feel a sense of existential dread about the outcomes of these elections, and particularly in the Trump era. And so when you combine those two things, you know, you get this very volatile situation.

[00:07:18] **G. Elliott Morris:** So, I want to talk about your view of what drives election outcomes. We've talked about what doesn't, or at least the thing that we overstate, which is, you know, the impact of campaigns and short-term news on public opinion polls and whatnot. But if you were to describe your theory of the case for what's going on in American elections right now, how would you put that?

[00:07:44] **Michael Podhorzer:** Yeah. So I would say that the starting point is what I call the Great Realignment, which is that over the last couple of decades, voters have sorted themselves out by party based on their cultural worldview. And so our parties are more homogeneous internally and more distinct from each other than they have been in our lifetimes. And the result of that is that there are very few people who are genuinely torn between the two parties, right?

[00:08:22] Most people feel quite at home in one party or another, which is not to say that they love everything about that party or agree with every position, but that on the whole, they are much more comfortable in one party than the other. And that has shrunk the number of what we would call swing voters or persuadable voters, right? So these are voters who either identify with one party but are willing to vote for the other, or they don't identify with any party and they're genuinely up for grabs.

[00:08:52] And that number has just gotten much, much smaller over time. You can just see that in the number of people who split their tickets. You can see that in the correlation between presidential results and down-ballot results, like for the Senate or the House. And so what that means is that the battlefield of an election has shrunk dramatically. And so most of what happens in an election is baked in before the election even starts. And so, you know, the most important thing to know about an election is what is the underlying partisan division of that electorate, and you can get a pretty good guess of what the outcome of the election's gonna be just from that.

[00:09:41] I'm not saying it's the only thing, but it's by far the most important thing. And so when you apply that to our current situation where the country is very narrowly divided, it means that our elections are going to be very close. And, you know, we've seen that in the last two presidential elections, which were decided by a very small number of votes in a very small number of states.

[00:10:08] And so, you know, the way I think about it is that there's this huge base of voters for each party who are pretty much locked in, and then there's this small sliver of voters who are actually in play. And the election is really about those voters. And so, you know, all the money and all the ads and all the media coverage is really focused on this very small group of people.

[00:10:35] Now, I wanna be clear, I'm not saying that campaigns don't matter, right? I think they matter a lot, but they matter on the margins. And in a close election, the margins are what matters. And so, you know, I think that the way that campaigns matter is not by persuading large numbers of people to change their minds, but by mobilizing their own base and by making sure that the small number of persuadable voters break their way.

[00:11:05] **G. Elliott Morris:** This is, I think, a point of, maybe not contention, but a point that requires some clarification for some of our listeners, because they might be hearing you say that, okay, these voters have sorted themselves into parties based on their cultural worldview. They might think, "Well, does that mean that everyone who's a Republican is a MAGA cultural warrior? And everyone who's a Democrat is, you know, a coastal liberal elite?" And that's not exactly what you mean, right?

[00:11:34] **Michael Podhorzer:** That's right. I mean, I think that there is a wide range of views within each party. And, you know, I think that the media often focuses on the most extreme elements of each party. But the reality is that there are a lot of moderate voters in both parties. But the key thing is that even those moderate voters are more comfortable in their own party than they are in the other party.

[00:12:01] And so, you know, a moderate Republican might not like Donald Trump, but they're still more likely to vote for him than for Joe Biden, because they see the Republican Party as being more aligned with their values and their interests than the Democratic Party. And the same is true on the other side.

[00:12:21] And so, you know, I think that the way to think about it is not that everyone in each party is a monolith, but that the center of gravity of each party has moved further apart. And so there's less overlap between the two parties than there used to be.

[0...12:40] **G. Elliott Morris:** So given that, given that these elections are so stable and that the outcomes are pretty predictable, right, you know, within a few points, let's say. Why is it that the discourse around politics is so volatile? Why do we have these freakouts?

[00:12:58] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think there are a few reasons. One is that, as I said before, the stakes are very high. And so people are very invested in the outcome. And so they're very sensitive to any information that suggests that things might not be going their way.

[00:13:17] I think another reason is that the media has a bias towards novelty and conflict. And so, you know, a story that says "the race is basically the same as it was yesterday" is not a very interesting story. A story that says "the race has tightened and the outcome is in doubt" is a much more interesting story. And so the media tends to amplify the noise and downplay the signal.

[00:13:46] And then I think the third reason is that there's a whole industry of political consultants and pundits whose job it is to explain what's happening in the election. And if the explanation is "it's basically baked in," then they don't have much to do. And so they have an incentive to create a narrative of a dynamic and unpredictable race.

[00:14:14] **G. Elliott Morris:** So it seems like there are two components to your theory, right? There is this long-term component, which is the sorting of voters into parties based on their cultural worldview. And then there's a short-term component, which is how campaigns and the media and other actors try to influence the outcome on the margins. Is that a fair way to put it?

[00:14:38] **Michael Podhorzer:** Yes, I think that's right. And I think that the important thing to understand is that the long-term component is much more powerful than the short-term component. And so, you know, the range of possible outcomes in an election is much narrower than the political discourse would suggest.

[00:15:00] **G. Elliott Morris:** So what does this mean for how we should think about the 2024 election? I mean, we're seeing polls now that show a very close race, some that show Trump ahead, some that show Biden ahead. How should we interpret those polls in light of your theory?

[00:15:18] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think the first thing is to not overreact to any single poll. I think you have to look at the average of polls. And when you do that, what you see is a very stable and very close race. And that's exactly what you would expect given the underlying fundamentals of the election.

[00:15:39] And so, you know, I think that the way to think about the election is that it's going to be very close and it's going to come down to a very small number of voters in a very small number of states. And so, you know, the outcome is very much in doubt. But it's not because the race is volatile, it's because the race is close.

[00:16:03] **G. Elliott Morris:** So what should we be looking for in the coming months? What are the things that could actually move the needle in a meaningful way?

[00:16:12] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think there are a few things. One is, you know, the performance of the economy. I think that's always a factor in presidential elections. I think another is the candidates themselves. You know, I think that both Biden and Trump are flawed candidates in different ways. And so, you know, how they perform on the campaign trail and in the debates could matter.

[00:16:38] And then I think the third thing is, you know, what I call "the vibes." And that is, you know, the overall mood of the country. And that's something that's very hard to measure, but I think it's very real. And so, you know, if people feel like the country is on the right track, that's good for the incumbent. If they feel like it's on the wrong track, that's bad for the incumbent.

[00:17:05] But again, I wanna stress that all of these things are happening on the margins. And so, you know, I don't think that any of them are likely to produce a landslide for either side. I think we're looking at another very close election.

[00:17:21] **G. Elliott Morris:** So, if you had to give advice to a Democratic campaign manager right now, what would you tell them?

[00:17:29] **Michael Podhorzer:** I would tell them to focus on the basics. I would tell them to focus on mobilizing their base and on persuading the small number of swing voters. And I would tell them to not get distracted by the day-to-day noise of the political discourse.

[00:17:49] And I would also tell them to be prepared for a very close election. And that means, you know, having a very strong ground game, having a very strong legal team, and being prepared to fight for every vote.

[00:18:05] **G. Elliott Morris:** And what about for the average person who's listening to this podcast? What's your advice for them? How should they consume the news and the polls over the next few months?

[00:18:16] **Michael Podhorzer:** I would say, you know, first of all, take a deep breath. You know, I think that it's very easy to get caught up in the anxiety of the moment, but it's important to remember that the race is very stable and that your personal anxiety is not going to change the outcome of the election.

[00:18:38] And then I would say, you know, focus on the big picture. You know, don't get bogged down in the day-to-day horse race. Think about what's at stake in the election. Think about the long-term direction of the country. And then, you know, make your decision based on that.

[00:18:57] And then finally, I would say, you know, if you're feeling anxious, the best thing to do is to get involved. You know, volunteer for a campaign, donate to a cause you care about, talk to your friends and neighbors. You know, taking action is the best antidote to anxiety.

[00:19:18] **G. Elliott Morris:** Let's talk about some of the different theories of the case for how Democrats could or should win in 2024, or at least how they could try to increase their odds of winning. You know, one of these is "popularism," which is a term that was coined by our mutual friend David Shor. What's your take on popularism?

[00:19:39] **Michael Podhorzer:** So, ==popularism is the idea that Democrats should focus on their most popular policies and downplay their less popular ones==. And, you know, on its face, it seems like a very sensible idea. You know, why wouldn't you want to talk about the things that people like and not talk about the things that people don't like?

[00:20:00] But I think that there are a few problems with it. One is that it's very hard to know what's popular and what's not. You know, you can poll these things, but polls are not always reliable. And public opinion is often very fluid and contradictory. ^3qtn

[00:20:19] Another problem is that it can lead to a very cautious and defensive style of politics. You know, if you're always worried about saying the wrong thing, you're never going to say anything bold or inspiring. ^cnbi

[00:20:34] And then I think the third problem is that it ignores the fact that politics is not just about policy, it's also about values and identity. And so, you know, you can have the most popular policies in the world, but if people don't feel like you're on their side, they're not going to vote for you. ^2h63

[00:20:55] And so, you know, my view is that popularism is a useful corrective to a certain kind of left-wing politics that is completely indifferent to public opinion. But I don't think it's a silver bullet. And I think that Democrats need to have a more holistic approach to politics that combines popular policies with a strong and clear and compelling message about their values and their vision for the country. ^jxkb

[00:21:28] **G. Elliott Morris:** So what would that message be? What is the vision that you think Democrats should be offering?

[00:21:34] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think it starts with the idea that we're all in this together. You know, I think that the fundamental divide in our country right now is between people who believe in a multiracial, pluralistic democracy and people who don't. And I think that Democrats need to be on the side of the former.

[00:21:58] And so, you know, I think the message should be about inclusion and fairness and opportunity for all. It should be about building a country where everyone has a chance to succeed, regardless of their race or their gender or their sexual orientation or where they come from.

[00:22:19] And I think that that's a message that can appeal to a broad majority of Americans. And I think it's a message that can unite the diverse coalition that is the Democratic Party.

[00:22:33] **G. Elliott Morris:** So it sounds like you're advocating for a more values-based and identity-based politics, as opposed to a purely policy-based politics.

[00:22:44] **Michael Podhorzer:** Yes, I think that's right. I mean, I think that policy is important, but I think that it has to be connected to a larger story about who we are and what we stand for. And I think that's what's been missing from a lot of Democratic politics in recent years.

[00:23:03] **G. Elliott Morris:** You wrote an article for *The New Republic* last year where you talked about the "MAGA base" and the need for Democrats to "break it." What did you mean by that?

[00:23:14] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, what I meant is that the Republican Party is now controlled by a faction that is fundamentally hostile to democracy. And that faction is the MAGA base. And as long as that base controls the Republican Party, our democracy is going to be in danger.

[00:23:36] And so, you know, I think that the long-term project for Democrats and for all pro-democracy forces in this country is to break the power of the MAGA base over the Republican Party. And that means a few things. It means, you know, defeating them at the ballot box, obviously. It means holding them accountable for their actions, including their attempts to overturn the 2020 election.

[00:24:06] And it also means, you know, trying to persuade some of the people who are part of that base to leave it. And I think that that's a very difficult and long-term project, but I think it's a necessary one if we're going to save our democracy.

[00:24:24] **G. Elliott Morris:** How do you do that? How do you persuade people to leave a political movement that is so central to their identity?

[00:24:32] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I don't think it's easy, and I don't think there's a magic formula. But I think it starts with understanding why people are drawn to that movement in the first place. And I think that there are a lot of different reasons. I think for some people, it's about economic anxiety. For others, it's about cultural resentment. For others, it's about a sense of grievance and victimhood.

[00:25:00] And so, you know, I think that you have to have a different approach for different people. But I think that the common thread is that you have to offer them a better alternative. You have to offer them a vision of a country that is more inclusive and more just and more prosperous than the one that Donald Trump is offering them.

[00:25:24] And you also have to be willing to engage with them. You know, I think that there's a tendency on the left to just write off these voters as deplorable and irredeemable. And I think that that's a mistake. I think that we have to be willing to have hard conversations with people who we disagree with.

[00:25:46] **G. Elliott Morris:** It sounds like a very difficult and long-term project.

[00:25:51] **Michael Podhorzer:** It is. And I'm not naive about the challenges. But I think it's the only way forward. I think that we can't have a healthy democracy in this country as long as one of our two major parties is in the grip of an anti-democratic movement.

[00:26:10] **G. Elliott Morris:** So, let's bring it back to the 2024 election. Given everything we've talked about, what do you see as the most likely outcome?

[00:26:20] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, as I said, I think it's going to be very close. And I think that either side could win. And so, you know, I'm not going to make a prediction. But I will say that I think that the fate of our democracy is on the ballot. And so, you know, I think that the stakes could not be higher.

[00:26:44] **G. Elliott Morris:** And what is your biggest fear for the next few months?

[00:26:48] **Michael Podhorzer:** My biggest fear is that we will have another freakout, and that that freakout will lead to a sense of despair and demobilization on the Democratic side. And that that will be the thing that tips the election to Trump.

[00:27:06] **G. Elliott Morris:** And what is your biggest hope?

[00:27:09] **Michael Podhorzer:** My biggest hope is that Democrats will stay calm and focused and disciplined. And that they will run a smart and effective campaign. And that they will win. And that we will be able to begin the long and difficult work of repairing our democracy.

[00:27:29] **G. Elliott Morris:** It seems to me that your argument about the Great Realignment and the stability of elections has some pretty profound implications for how we think about the role of persuasion in politics. You know, if most voters are locked in, then what's the point of trying to persuade anyone?

[00:27:49] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think that's a fair question. And I think that there are a couple of ways to answer it. One is that, as I said, even if the number of persuadable voters is small, in a close election, they can be decisive. And so, you know, it's still worth trying to persuade them.

[00:28:10] But I think the other thing is that persuasion is not just about changing people's minds about who to vote for in the next election. It's also about changing the broader climate of opinion. It's about changing the terms of the debate. It's about shaping the way that people think about the big issues facing the country.

[00:28:34] And that's a much longer-term project. But I think it's a vital one. And so, you know, I don't think we should give up on persuasion. I just think we need to be more realistic about what it can and can't do in the short term.

[00:28:50] **G. Elliott Morris:** So, if you were to look at the electorate and divide it up into different groups, who are the voters that you think are actually persuadable in 2024?

[00:29:02] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think there are a few groups. I think one group is what you might call "reluctant Trump voters." These are people who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, but they're not thrilled about it. They have some reservations about his character and his fitness for office. And I think that they are potentially persuadable.

[00:29:28] I think another group is "disaffected Democrats." These are people who are part of the Democratic coalition, but they're not happy with the party. They feel like the party has taken them for granted or has moved too far to the left. And I think that they are also potentially persuadable.

[00:29:48] And then I think the third group is "true independents." These are people who don't identify with either party and who really do make up their minds on a case-by-case basis. And, you know, that's a small group, but it's an important one.

[00:30:05] **G. Elliott Morris:** And how do you persuade those different groups? Do you need a different message for each of them?

[00:30:11] **Michael Podhorzer:** Yes, I think you do. I mean, I think that, you know, for the reluctant Trump voters, I think the message is about character and fitness for office. It's about saying, "Look, you may not love Joe Biden, but you know that he's a decent and honorable man, and you know that he respects the Constitution and the rule of law. And you can't say the same thing about Donald Trump."

[00:30:38] For the disaffected Democrats, I think the message is about delivering results. It's about saying, "Look, we know that you're not happy with everything that we've done, but we've made real progress on the issues that you care about, like healthcare and climate change and jobs. And we need you to stick with us so that we can continue that progress."

[00:31:02] And for the true independents, I think the message is about common sense and problem-solving. It's about saying, "Look, we're not ideologues. We're just trying to get things done. And we're willing to work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, who is serious about solving the problems that our country faces."

[00:31:26] **G. Elliott Morris:** It sounds like a very complicated and nuanced strategy.

[00:31:31] **Michael Podhorzer:** It is. But politics is complicated and nuanced. And I think that anyone who tells you that there's a simple solution is either a fool or a liar.

[00:31:44] **G. Elliott Morris:** So let's talk about the media's role in all of this. You've been critical of the way that the media covers politics. What do you think they're getting wrong?

[00:31:54] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think there are a few things. I think one is the focus on the horse race. You know, as I said before, I think that the media is obsessed with who's up and who's down, and they neglect the more substantive issues.

[00:32:12] I think another is the "both sides" fallacy. You know, I think that there's a tendency in the media to treat the two parties as if they are equally culpable for the problems in our politics. And I just don't think that's true. I think that one party has become a radical, anti-democratic force, and the other party has not. And I think that the media has a responsibility to make that clear to the public.

[00:32:42] And then I think the third thing is the focus on conflict and negativity. You know, I think that the media has a bias towards stories that are about division and discord and dysfunction. And they tend to ignore the stories that are about cooperation and progress and hope.

[00:33:04] **G. Elliott Morris:** What would you like to see the media do differently?

[00:33:08] **Michael Podhorzer:** I would like to see them focus more on the substance and less on the horse race. I would like to see them be more willing to call out lies and disinformation, regardless of which party it's coming from. And I would like to see them tell more stories that are about the things that unite us as a country, rather than the things that divide us.

[00:33:32] **G. Elliott Morris:** Do you think that's a realistic hope?

[00:33:35] **Michael Podhorzer:** I don't know. I mean, I think that there are powerful institutional and economic incentives that push the media in the other direction. But I think that we have to try. I think that a free and fair press is essential for a healthy democracy. And so we have to do everything we can to support the journalists and the news organizations that are trying to do the right thing.

[0t:34:04] **G. Elliott Morris:** Let me ask you about something that I think is on a lot of people's minds, which is the role of age in this election. You have two candidates who are older than any two major party nominees in American history. How do you think that's going to play out?

[00:34:23] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think it's a legitimate issue. And I think that it's something that voters are going to be thinking about. And I think that both campaigns are going to have to address it.

[00:34:36] For Biden, I think the challenge is to demonstrate that he has the stamina and the cognitive acuity to be president for another four years. And I think he's been doing a pretty good job of that so far. I mean, if you look at his schedule and his performance, he's a very active and engaged president.

[00:34:56] For Trump, I think the challenge is different. I think that his age is less of an issue than his temperament and his character. And I think that the more that people see of him, the more they are reminded of why they voted him out of office in the first place.

[00:35:16] So, you know, I think that age is a factor, but I don't think it's the determinative factor. And I think that, in the end, voters are going to make their decision based on a whole range of issues, not just the age of the candidates.

[00:35:32] **G. Elliott Morris:** What about the vice presidential picks? How much do you think they will matter in this election?

[00:35:39] **Michael Podhorzer:** I think they matter more than usual, precisely because of the age of the presidential candidates. I think that voters are going to be looking at the vice presidential nominees as potential presidents. And so, you know, I think that both Biden and Trump have to choose very carefully.

[00:36:00] For Biden, I think he has a very strong and capable vice president in Kamala Harris. And I think that she's going to be a real asset to the ticket.

[00:36:10] For Trump, it's a little more complicated. You know, he has a lot of different options, and I think that his choice will tell us a lot about what kind of president he would be if he were to win again. You know, is he going to choose someone who is a traditional Republican, or is he going to choose someone who is a MAGA loyalist? And I think that that choice will have a big impact on the election.

[00:36:38] **G. Elliott Morris:** Let's talk about some of the key issues in this election. What do you see as the most important issues for voters?

[00:36:46] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think there are a few. I think the economy is always at the top of the list. And, you know, I think that the Biden administration has a very good story to tell on the economy. You know, we have the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, we have strong wage growth, and we're seeing a manufacturing boom in this country.

[00:37:09] But I also think that there are a lot of people who are not feeling the benefits of that recovery. And so, you know, I think that Democrats have to be very clear about what they're going to do to address the cost of living and to make sure that the economy works for everyone, not just the people at the top.

[00:37:28] I think another key issue is abortion. I think that the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was a political earthquake. And I think that it has mobilized a whole new generation of voters who are determined to protect their reproductive rights. And I think that that is a huge advantage for Democrats.

[00:37:52] And then I think the third key issue is democracy itself. I think that there are a lot of voters who are very concerned about the threat that Donald Trump poses to our democratic institutions. And I think that that is a very powerful motivator for them to vote for Joe Biden.

[00:38:12] **G. Elliott Morris:** What about immigration? That seems to be an issue that Republicans are really leaning into.

[00:38:18] **Michael Podhorzer:** Yes, they are. And I think that it's a very potent issue for them. I think that they have been very effective at using it to stoke fear and resentment. And I think that Democrats have struggled to find a good answer to it.

[00:38:36] My view is that Democrats need to have a two-pronged approach. I think they need to be clear that they support a secure border and an orderly immigration system. But I also think they need to be clear that they support a humane and compassionate approach to immigration that is consistent with our values as a nation of immigrants.

[00:39:00] And I think that if they can strike that balance, they can neutralize the issue and maybe even turn it to their advantage.

[00:39:08] **G. Elliott Morris:** What is one thing that you think people are getting wrong about this election?

[00:39:14] **Michael Podhorzer:** I think the biggest thing that people are getting wrong is the idea that the election is about persuasion. As we've discussed, I think the election is much more about mobilization. It's about getting your base to turn out. And so, you know, I think that the campaign that does a better job of that is the campaign that's going to win.

[00:39:38] **G. Elliott Morris:** And what is one thing that you think people should be paying more attention to?

[00:39:43] **Michael Podhorzer:** I think people should be paying more attention to the down-ballot races. You know, I think that there's a tendency to focus all of our attention on the presidential race. But the reality is that there are a lot of other very important races on the ballot this year, for the Senate, for the House, for governor, for state legislature.

[00:40:06] And those races are going to have a huge impact on our lives. And so, you know, I would encourage people to get informed about the candidates who are running in their state and their district and to vote all the way down the ballot.

[00:40:22] **G. Elliott Morris:** We've talked a lot about the challenges facing Democrats in this election. What do you see as their biggest strengths?

[00:40:30] **Michael Podhorzer:** I think their biggest strength is their coalition. You know, the Democratic Party is a very diverse coalition of voters. It includes young people, people of color, suburban women, union members. And when that coalition is united and mobilized, it is a very powerful force.

[00:40:52] I also think that Democrats have a huge advantage on the issues. As I mentioned, I think they have a very strong case to make on the economy, on abortion, and on democracy. And I think that those issues are going to be very salient for voters in this election.

[00:41:12] And then finally, I think that Democrats have a huge advantage in their candidate. I think that Joe Biden is a decent, honorable, and experienced leader. And I think that he is a stark contrast to the chaos and the corruption and the cruelty of Donald Trump.

[00:41:32] **G. Elliott Morris:** And what about the Republicans? What do you see as their biggest strengths?

[00:41:38] **Michael Podhorzer:** I think their biggest strength is the intensity of their base. You know, the MAGA base is a very motivated and very loyal group of voters. And they will turn out to vote for Donald Trump no matter what.

[00:41:54] I also think that Republicans have an advantage in the current media environment. As we've discussed, I think that the media has a tendency to amplify their message of fear and division.

[00:42:08] And then I think that Republicans also have a structural advantage in our political system. You know, because of the Electoral College and the way that our congressional districts are drawn, they can win national elections even if they get fewer votes than the Democrats.

[00:42:28] **G. Elliott Morris:** So given all of that, if you had to put a number on it, what do you think the chances are that Donald Trump wins the election?

[00:42:36] **Michael Podhorzer:** I'm not going to put a number on it, because I think that that's a fool's errand. But I will say that I think it's a very real possibility. And I think that anyone who is not taking that possibility seriously is not paying attention.

[00:42:52] **G. Elliott Morris:** Let me ask you a final question. What keeps you up at night?

[00:42:57] **Michael Podhorzer:** What keeps me up at night is the thought of a second Trump presidency. I think that it would be a disaster for our country and for the world. I think that it would be the end of American democracy as we know it. And so, you know, that's what motivates me to do the work that I do every day.

[00:43:20] **G. Elliott Morris:** And what gives you hope?

[00:43:23] **Michael Podhorzer:** What gives me hope is the American people. I think that, at our best, we are a generous and a tolerant and a decent people. And I believe that, in the end, we will reject the politics of fear and division and embrace the politics of hope and unity.

[00:43:44] I'm also inspired by the millions of people who are working every day to make this country a better place. The organizers, the activists, the volunteers, the everyday citizens who are fighting for a more just and a more equitable and a more democratic society. They are the ones who give me hope for the future.

[00:44:08] **G. Elliott Morris:** We've been talking about the national political environment, but I want to zoom in a little bit on some of the key swing states. What are the states that you're watching most closely in 2024?

[00:44:20] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think the big three are the same as they were in 2020: Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. I think that those three states are going to be absolutely critical. And I think that the election is very likely to be decided in one or more of them.

[00:44:40] I'm also watching Arizona and Georgia very closely. Those were two states that Biden flipped in 2020, and I think they're going to be very competitive again this year.

[00:44:52] And then I think there are a couple of other states that are worth keeping an eye on. One is Nevada, which has been a swing state for a while, but it seems to be trending a little bit more Republican. And the other is North Carolina, which has been a perennial target for Democrats, but they haven't been able to break through there yet.

[00:45:15] **G. Elliott Morris:** What are some of the unique dynamics in those states? What are the things that make them different from each other?

[00:45:22] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, they're all different in their own ways. You know, Pennsylvania is a state with a large rural population and a large working-class population. And it's also a state with two big cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, that are heavily Democratic. And so the election there is always a battle between the cities and the rest of the state.

[00:45:46] Michigan is a state with a strong union tradition and a large African American population, particularly in Detroit. It's also a state that has been hit hard by the decline of the manufacturing industry. And so economic issues are always very important there.

[00:46:05] Wisconsin is a state that is very racially polarized. You have a very white rural and suburban population and a very diverse urban population, particularly in Milwaukee. And the politics of the state often revolve around that racial divide.

[00:46:24] Arizona is a state with a large and growing Latino population. It's also a state with a lot of retirees and a lot of independent voters. And so the politics there are very fluid and unpredictable.

[00:46:40] And Georgia is a state that is undergoing a rapid demographic transformation. You have a large and growing African American population, particularly in the Atlanta metropolitan area. And that has made the state much more competitive for Democrats.

[00:47:00] **G. Elliott Morris:** It's interesting how you describe the dynamics in those states, because it seems like it reinforces your broader theory about the Great Realignment. It's all about these demographic and cultural divisions.

[00:47:14] **Michael Podhorzer:** Exactly. I mean, I think that the story of American politics over the last few decades is the story of how these demographic and cultural divisions have come to define our parties and our elections. And you can see that playing out in each of these swing states in different ways.

[00:47:35] **G. Elliott Morris:** Let me ask you about a different kind of division, which is the division within the Democratic Party. We've seen some tensions between the progressive wing of the party and the more moderate wing. How do you see that playing out in 2024?

[00:47:52] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think that there are real differences of opinion within the Democratic Party, and I think that's a healthy thing. You know, we're a big tent party, and we should be able to have a robust debate about the best way forward.

[00:48:08] But I also think that, when it comes to the general election, Democrats are going to be united. I think that the threat of a second Trump presidency is so great that it will overshadow any internal disagreements. And I think that you're going to see progressives and moderates working together to defeat him.

[00:48:30] And I think that Joe Biden has done a very good job of bridging the divides within the party. You know, he's governed as a progressive, but he's also worked with moderates to get things done. And I think that he is a figure who can unite the entire party behind him.

[00:48:48] **G. Elliott Morris:** What about the Republican Party? Do you see any similar divisions on that side?

[00:48:54] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think that there is a division between the MAGA base and the more traditional establishment Republicans. But I think that that division is much less significant than the divisions within the Democratic Party. And the reason for that is that the MAGA base has completely taken over the Republican Party.

[00:49:18] And so, you know, there may be some establishment Republicans who are not happy with Donald Trump, but they have no power to stop him. And so, you know, I think that the Republican Party is going to be united behind Trump in the general election, for better or for worse.

[00:49:38] **G. Elliott Morris:** We've talked a lot about the challenges and the opportunities in this election. If you had to boil it down to one thing, what is the single most important thing that will determine the outcome of the 2024 election?

[00:49:52] **Michael Podhorzer:** I think it's turnout. I think that in a close election, the side that does a better job of getting its voters to the polls is the side that's going to win. And so, you know, I think that both campaigns are going to be laser-focused on their ground game and their get-out-the-vote operations.

[00:50:14] And I think that that's where the election will be won or lost. It's not going to be won or lost on Twitter or on cable news. It's going to be won or lost in the neighborhoods and the communities where people live.

[00:50:28] **G. Elliott Morris:** One of the things that I've noticed in my own work is that there's a growing disconnect between how political elites think about politics and how ordinary voters think about politics. Do you see that as well?

[00:50:42] **Michael Podhorzer:** Yes, I do. And I think it's a big problem. I think that there is a tendency for people who work in politics to get caught up in their own bubble. They talk to each other, they read the same things, they follow the same people on Twitter. And they can lose touch with the concerns and the priorities of ordinary voters.

[00:51:06] And I think that that's one of the reasons why we have so much political volatility and why we have so many surprising election outcomes. It's because the people who are running the campaigns and covering the campaigns don't always have a good understanding of what's actually happening on the ground.

[00:51:26] And so, you know, I think it's really important for people who work in politics to get out of their bubble and to spend time talking to real voters. And that's one of the things that I've always tried to do in my own work.

[00:51:40] **G. Elliott Morris:** So how do we fix that? How do we bridge that gap between the elites and the voters?

[00:51:46] **Michael Podhorzer:** Well, I think it starts with humility. I think that people who work in politics need to be more humble about what they know and what they don't know. And they need to be more willing to listen to people who have different experiences and different perspectives.

[00:52:04] I also think that we need to have a more decentralized and grassroots approach to politics. You know, I think that for too long, our politics has been dominated by a small group of consultants and pollsters and media figures in Washington, D.C. and New York City.

[00:52:24] And I think we need to empower local leaders and local organizations to play a bigger role in our politics. Because they are the ones who are closest to the ground and who have the best understanding of what's happening in their communities.

[00:52:40] **G. Elliott Morris:** It's a powerful vision. And I think it's a good place to end our conversation. Before we go, where can people find you and your work online?
