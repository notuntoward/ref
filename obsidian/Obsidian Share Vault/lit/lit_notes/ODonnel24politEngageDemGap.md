___
If all 2024 voters had paid "a great deal" to news media, Harris would have won by a 6% margin; if they had paid "none at all," Trump would have won by a 19% margin.  The article says the effect of news consumption "goes beyond" education polarization.

Unfortunately, "unengaged," "low propensity" voters: 
- turn out in presidential election years
- are motivated by material factors (bad for both Trump 2020 and Harris 2024)
- the little political content they get is from social circles or media bubbles
	- YouTube, Facebook, Instagram...
- Trump was very effective at getting his message onto these venues
#### What this means for campaigns
- **off-year races**: D's can rely more on traditional media, talk about cultural stuff, since low propensity voters won't be there (although author says this is also a time for economic issues (as opposed to presidential years, isn't it always a time for economic issues?))
- **presidential years**: D's must learn how to hit low engagement voters where they are with a more material campaign 
#### Question
- ? are "low propensity" voters the same as "unengaged" voters?  This article uses the terms interchangeably.
