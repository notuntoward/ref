> **Abstract**
> With almost all developers (92%) using or experimenting with AI coding tools,   AI continues to transform nearly every aspect of the software development lifecycle. Despite rapid technological advancements, the fundamental requirement to understand code remains unchanged, for developers and managers alike. Whether code is manually written by a developer or generated by AI, eventually, someone else will need to understand and interpret that code.

Good graphs showing developer knowledge sharing.  Not too much on how they would solve it, although Swimm's website has a demo video.
