> **Abstract**
> The US electrical grid has undergone substantial transformation with increased penetration of wind and solar forms of variable renewable energy (VRE). Despite the benefits of VRE for decarbonization, it has garnered some controversy for inducing unwanted effects in regional electricity markets. In this study, the role of VRE penetration is examined on the system electricity price and price volatility based on hourly, real-time, historical data from six independent system operators (ISOs) in the US using quantile and skew t-distribution regressions. After correcting for temporal effects, we found an increase in VRE penetration is associated with a decrease in system electricity price in all ISOs studied. The increase in VRE penetration is associated with a decrease in temporal price volatility in five out of six ISOs studied. The relationships are nonlinear. These results are consistent with the modern portfolio theory where diverse volatile assets may lead to more stable and less risky portfolios.
