Says¬†**first fully modern NN like in books today**¬†was [[Rumelhart86learnRepBackprop]]. ¬†NNs were first proposed in 1944 [[Hardesty17explainedNNs]], but the Rumelhart paper was concise, and its explanations are what we see in books and classes today. ¬†Was also followed-on by more papers that addressed Minsky‚Äôs NN objections, and further explained representation learning.

## This web page seems to be authoritative. Citing examples:
- [[Fradkov20earlyHistoryML]]
- Stanford : CS 486/686 Lecture 21 A brief history of deep learning
- U. of Waterloo: seem to have copied Stanford‚Äôs notes
