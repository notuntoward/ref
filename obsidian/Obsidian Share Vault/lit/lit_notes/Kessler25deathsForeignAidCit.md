Musk/Trump's elimination of USAID has already killed many people.

The [Impact Dashboard Estimate](Nichols25aidCutImpactDashbrd) is:
- 96,502 Adult Deaths so far (5/28/25)
- 201,363 Child Deaths so far
- <u>103 Deaths Per Hour</u>

But this fact checker seems to guess that the number is 100-200 k deaths.

Before Trump's 2nd term, US was world's largest aid provider in dollars, but <u>as a fraction of GDP US aid was near the bottom of major democracies</u> (it was 0.2% GDP vs. the 0.7% UN target, so we're shirking our duties like DE was for NATO)

In testimony, Rubio said this was a lie, and in a later statement, tried a whataboutism:  France and the UK also cut their aid, and China is not a big donor.

Thing is, even after the UK cuts, they were at 0.3 %, still more than the US.

Rubio keeps saying that the US will provide aid, but hasn't done it.
