> - doesn’t like LLMs
> - doesn’t like autoregressive models forecasting future behavior (gulp)
> - thinks JEPA is the way forward, which do more than text (“predicting text is simple)” but it’s decades away.
> - machine IQ > human IQ “not in the next 10 years or longer”

> Some choice quotes:
> 
> - “The future of AI, I tell you, is non-generative. It works for text, doesn't work for anything else.”
> - Predicting text is simple,”

> - Any 17-year-old can learn to drive a car with 20 hours of practice. We still don't have Level 5 autonomous cars
> - “Most of what we know … doesn't come
