Non-ideological voters are said to have believed that Trump was good for the econ because he was a successful businessman and b/c the econ was great in the 1st 3 yrs of his 1st term.  It seemed "logical."  Meanwhile, Biden's term had high inflation and high interest rates, perhaps cementing the idea that D's are terrible at the econ (but he paid more for it that Trump paid for the pandemic,  [[Boak23presToutsBidenomics|Boak23presToutsBidenomics]] )

But a couple months into Trumps 2nd term, voters are not liking what they see: On 3/13/25, Trump got is by far worst poll on the economy, with only 44% approving, a net -12% disapproval.

This is compared to Biden's 34% approval on the econ (not sure that net was).  [[Boak23presToutsBidenomics|Boak23presToutsBidenomics]] , so Ds didn't like it either, even though it was relatively good near end of Biden term.

Are Rs actually paying attention to evidence, are they being deprogrammed?
