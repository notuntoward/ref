___
Tutorial on [[RMoK Time Series Forecasting?]], with RMoK added to the [[Nixtla24openSrcTimeSeriesFrcst|Nixtla24: Open Source Time Series Ecosystem]] library (warns that not stable at time of writing).  Suggests that this might be the first decent KAN forecasting library, although improvements against baselines are tiny, and the baselines themselves are tranformerish, which [aren't great](Manokhin23worksTSfrcstNixtla) for forecasting, of the kind I've been doing, compared to boosted trees, like [[LightGBM]].

Also does [[Kim22ReversInstncNorm]] to handle nonstationarity.
