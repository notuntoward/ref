Scabs dry out wounds and block fluids that enhance healing, although they do protect from infection. Traditional bandages block infection, but allow wounds to dry.

New bandage, and other treatments, use hydrocolloid gel to allow wounds to heal while moist, yet still blocking infections.  Other wound treatments do similar.  Guy put the recommendations in the video description:
#### Recommended bandages, and other treatments
(from video description)

BANDAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
Tip for Hydrocolloid bandages: warm them up for 30-60 seconds in your hands before and after applying.  This helps it bond better with your skin. 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Best Bandage: Bandaid‚Äôs HydroSeal All Purpose
Long lasting, comfortable, versatile. I will always keep these on me and I‚Äôve given these as gifts.  Also available at Walmart or a pharmacy.

Amazon: https://geni.us/BandAidHydroSeal

2Ô∏è‚É£ Bandage Runner Up: Amazon Hydrocolloid
Slightly cheaper and the shape I find better on arms and legs - less ugly too!  Not as good for fingers.  Made in the USA, packaged by a Japanese company ASO Corp.  They also own Care Science, All Health and sell to CVS.   https://geni.us/AmzHydroBandage

3Ô∏è‚É£ Big Scrapes: ConvaTec DuoDERM Extra Thin
Thin enough that it won‚Äôt bother you but thicker than the super-thin versions that are better for acne or very light wounds.  Great for scrapes to your knees, faces and burns.  https://geni.us/DuoDermET

Backup: Dimora and Niceful Hydrocolloids are from one of the big 3 Chinese Healthcare companies.  I bought one, they seem good.  https://geni.us/DimoraHydro

4Ô∏è‚É£ Stops Bleeding: Calcium Alginate
Better than cotton at stopping nosebleeds and bad cuts as calcium ions encourage clotting.  I didn‚Äôt bleed enough to compare brands so I only got Med Pride which seemed to work.  BleedCease is one namebrand and the product has similar reviews.  

Med Pride: https://geni.us/MedPrideAlginate
BleedCease: https://geni.us/BleedCease

If you keep it on for more than a few hours you need to use a covering like transparent film to keep it from drying out - I use a roll of tegaderm which is also a cheap way to keep small wounds protected.

ü©∏ FIND BETTER WOUND CARE ü©∏
Wound education is one of the lowest priorities and many surgeons doctors and nurses are unaware of the latest practices. 
1) Search up ‚Äúwound care‚Äù + ‚Äúyour city / town‚Äù these might be clinics, or hospitals and in many cases you can self-refer.  Sometimes these are run by a trained nurse, other times a full department

2) Look up your local telehealth line and ask to be referred to a wound care clinic 

3) Desperate for a second opinion:   / woundcare    There are some great professionals there.
