100 day poll shows an increasingly, and broadly unpopular Trump, but the D's are hardly popular either.  Whatever, it's clear that Americans are producing increasingly unpopular presidents.  Also, a 100 day poll is a kind of consistent benchmark across the years, since all presidents undergo a popularity decline (maybe a good election prediction feature?)
# Trump's declining popularity
@ 100 days, majority disapproves on Trump on major issues; his disapproval is lower @ 100 days than any president (measured, I think), and his drop has been rapid (most rapid?).  Deporting illegal immigrants is slightly popular, though.
# News not good for Ds, though
Americans:
- trust Trump over congressional Ds (37 to 30%) on major problems
- see the Ds out of touch with concerns of common people (7 in 10)
- vs. 6 in 10 who say same about Trump
# Decline in 100 day approval over presidents since FDR
- a nearly linear drop of 100 day approval since FDR: Americans are less satisfied
	- b/c, before polarization, an elected R or D would have many policies approved by either Rs or Ds?
	- a clear graph showing how our elections are increasingly producing unsatisfactory presidents
	- or, are Americans just whinier now?
	- would  [[Ranked Choice Voting]] help?
