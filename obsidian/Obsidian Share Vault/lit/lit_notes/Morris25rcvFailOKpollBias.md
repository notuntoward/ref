[[Ranked Choice Voting]] doesn't always pick the Condorcet winner but is quick, understandable and more correct than plurality.  There are fixes and alternatives.  Also, the D's have a terrible brand while the R's have biased polls.
### How can Dems be winning 2025 Swings?
- 58% disapprove of D's, more than disapprove of GOP, and worse than b/f 2024 elections
- but 2025 D's are winning swings by a 6 pt. higher margin than 2016, 2018
	- 1/2 probably due to the D's becoming the educated party
	- 1/2 must be "fundraising, local party and candidate brands, and just plain old-fashioned campaigning."
### RCV criticisms
- `Condorcet Winner`: run a pair-wise race between all candidates and count the votes.  Sum the votes (or sum the wins? same?) for all pairs and the one who gets the most votes is the Condorcet Winner.  This is the ideal `most majoritarian candidate`.
- RCV (with instant runoff, like in Seattle) doesn't *always* pick the Condorcet Winner but picks it more often than the usual plurality system
	- 2009 Vermont failure example: [[Karthik24rcvGoesBadVT2009|Karthik24rcvGoesBadVT2009: When Ranked Choice Voting Goes Bad: The 2009 Burlington Mayoral Election]] 
	- RCV (`bottom-two-runoff`): "fixes" the problem (totally?) but is harder to understand by the voting public
- A paper ([[Vishwanath25rcvEffects|Vishwanath25rcvEffects]]) "found no evidence for the other supposed benefits of RCV, which include things like ideological moderation and policy responsiveness."
	- This guy stopped supporting RCV b/c of this: [[Drutman23updateRCVview|Drutman23: How I updated my views on ranked choice voting]] 
- Author likes [[Wikipedia25openListVote|Open list proportional representation]] but there are other alternatives
- Nice graph showing the RCV voting process:

### R polling firms are biased towards Trump
- way more Trump positive than others
- have had a pro-GOP house effect "for a long time" e.g. [[Gelman20estPollHouseEffects|Gelman20estPollHouseEffects]] (interesting graphic, e.g. Trafalgar).
