# Common Calorie Burning Beliefs

| Theory                                                        | True?         | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Men’s metabolisms are faster than women’s.                    | No            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Our metabolisms slow down in middle age.                      | No            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Exercising more means we’ll burn more calories                | No            | Not overall, but will decrease appetite, so                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| What is our metabolism?                                       |               | all the work that all 37 trillion of your cells do every day                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| And teenagers are burning the most calories?                  | Yes           | But pound for pound, nobody burns calories like a 3- or 4-year-old child.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Does an adult's metabolism slow down a lot during middle age? | No and Yes    | 20-50: same per pound<br>60+: yes, some slowing                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| The more calories I burn and the more weight I lose, No?      | Not long term | Body adjusts to more exercise by burning less elsewhere.  But maybe it *can* reduce eating (this weight loss) and turn fat into lean body loss ([[Health/Weight Loss.md#Exercise vs. Diet in Weight Loss \|Exercise vs. Diet in Weight Loss]]) |
| Can we boost our metabolisms with the right pills or foods?   | No            | high-carb, high protein, ... doesn't affect calories burned                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Daily brain burns same calories as 5k run                     | Yes           | 300 kcals, but doesn't matter if you're thinking or zoned out                                                                                                                                                                                  |
