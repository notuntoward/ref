From a continuous temperature graph or a scatter graph, people don't perceive abrupt climate change but they do if they're shown binary data, a binary "did the lake freeze or not" over time.  

- `shifting baselines`: problem: people have climate memory of 2-8 years, so have a hard time perceiving climate change by simple exposure to it.
- `climate stripes` are another way to show climate change in terms of cold and hot years (really a color map with blue shades for cold and red shades for hot, with white choseh somehow)
- climate was near bottom priority of 22 issues in 2024 poll
- The [[Liu25binaryClimateDataPerceive|paper]] appeared to do some kind of threshold detection, but I didn't read it.
