In 2024, congressional moderates (either R or D) did better than expected, given their district fundamentals (they don't explain how).  Extreme Maganists took the hardest hit, but Justice Democrats underperformed almost as much.  Note that the `New Democrats` are considered "establishment" D's while the `Bue Dogs` are considered "moderate."
