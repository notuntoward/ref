>> **Abstract**
> The Annenberg Civics Knowledge Survey, conducted since 2006, focuses on the public’s understanding of the Constitution of the United States. Since 2013, the civics knowledge survey has been conducted annually for Constitution Day (Sept. 17) as the Annenberg Constitution Day Civics Survey. Among the 2024 findings: A majority of U.S. adults cannot name most of the rights protected under the First Amendment: the only one with wide recognition is freedom of speech, which 74% could name. The other rights were known by under half of respondents — for example, freedom of religion was named by 39% and freedom of the press by 29%. See the survey for full results. While 65% in our survey could name all three branches of government (executive, legislative, judicial), 15% could not name any. The survey found strong public support for several potential reforms to the U.S. Supreme Court. These include term limits, mandatory retirement ages, and prohibiting justices from participating in cases in which they have personal or financial interests.
