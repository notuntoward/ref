If a recession follows Trump's tariffs, a D takeover of congress is plausible, or at least R fear of it might break some of their obedience to Trump:

1. Recessions are historically terrible for the party in power, and Trump is already getting terrible econ ratings
2. The R's did not win by large margins in 2024, even though this was the kind of election that advantaged Trump (infrequent, low info voters)
3. The D's historically do well in non-presidential-year elections (engaged, educated voters), and April 2025 special elections, already hint at this. They look like 2017, before the 2018 blue wave.
4. Already, a half a dozen R Senators joined the D's to pass an anti-Tariff bill (not the house, though)

Even before the tariffs, Trump's tariff talking points may have been why his approval ratings dropped.  Trump has historically gotten economic high approval ratings -- in 2024 40% over voters who switched to Trump in 2024 said econ and inflation were most important to them -- his economic ratings are even worse now (4/5/25) than his overall approval rating.   If his tariffs are seen to cause a recession, the R's are in big trouble:

> No party or politician is recession proof. Historically, even truly dominant political parties have suffered enormous political defeats during major economic downturns.

But this time the R's aren't dominant, and it's totally clear who will be responsible for it (unlike with Smoot-Hawley tariffs, where the president wasn't so clearly responsible).  This could make it possible for the D's to win back congress and the Senate
