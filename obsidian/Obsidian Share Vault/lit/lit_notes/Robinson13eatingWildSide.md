* Table of antioxidants of chokeberries versus modern blueberries, yet berries in the supermarket are antioxidants Superstars: about four times as much as Store-Bought fruits and 10 times more than vegetables. Page 241
* It took only 8 years to domesticate blueberries compared to hundreds or a thousand for other foods. Page 242
* Blueberry juice isn't refined as other juices. And is pretty good for nutrition. Page 46
* Frozen blueberries nearly as good as fresh, amicrowaving is the best way to thaw them, and cooked or canned are more nutritious than raw. Page. 247-8
* Peaches get mealy when exposed to temperatures under 50°. This is called a chilling injury. Page 279

* However, red fleshed, "blood peaches" available at farmers markets, etc, are far better than either white fleist or yellow fleshed. chart on page 281.

* The bulging in a navel (Washington) orange is an undeveloped second orange, a failed twin. Page 322
* It's difficult to find ripe Non-Organic oranges because they have mostly been degreened with ethylene. This is a bummer because they don't ripen after they're picked.

* The red fleshed Cara Cara orange has two to three times the nutrients as a naval orange. Page 326

* Orange juice is is closer to the nutritional value of the whole fruit and then our others because consumers affect the fact that the juice can be cloudy. While 'not from concentrate' is more nutritious, if you think it tastes better, it's probably because of the chemical additive that are necessary to keep it from decomposing. Page 331-2
