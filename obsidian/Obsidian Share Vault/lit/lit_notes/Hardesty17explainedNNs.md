> “Deep learning,” the machine-learning technique behind the best-performing artificial-intelligence systems of the past decade, is really a revival of the 70-year-old concept of neural networks.

The first ANN was proposed in 1944 and NNs have gone in and out of fashion a few times since.  

This article doesn’t note when the 1st NN that passed the Minsky test was, or the 1st paper that knew about backprop.  There's some of that in [[Kurenkov20briefHistoryNN|A Brief History of Neural Nets and Deep Learning]]
