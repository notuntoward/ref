> **Abstract**
> Many of us have seen microscopic images of neurons in the brain ‚Äî each neuron appearing as a glowing cell in a vast sea of blackness. This image is misleading: Neurons don‚Äôt exist in isolation. In the human brain, some 86 billion neurons form 100 trillion connections to each other ‚Äî numbers that, ironically, are far too large for the human brain to fathom.

 A source for the human brain having 100 T connections, 86B neurons.
> 
 - Yann Le Cunn likes to say 100T connections in [[Wodecki24yannLeCunDitchGenAI]] and elsewhere.
 - Compare with ~ 1.76 T connections in GPT-4 [[Cao24leCunCatSmarterThanAI]]

 This article is about how researchers are trying to find how every neuron is connected to every other neuron, creating a connectome. ¬†Then they layer cell type and activity pattern on top. (I wonder if/where stuff like dopamine fit in)

 They hope to model higher order connection activity between clusters of neurons.

 Idea that ‚Äúyou are your connectome,‚Äù argument being that when you sleep, your consciousness, thoughts and feelings are interrupted, and brain activity changes dramatically. ¬†But your connectome stays ‚Äúlargely intact,‚Äù and you wake up still being yourself.
