Six months of 2x/wk weight training <u>improved verbal episodic memory and brain structure health</u> in a study of 44 older people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment.  Five ended the study with *no cognitive impairment*; researches speculate *even better results after 3 years of training*.  Far cheaper than new anti-amyloid drugs costing $30k/yr (not clear if better, though). The study: [[Ribeiro25resistTrainProtectMildCog]].
#### Brain structure improvements
- protected volume of right side of hippocampus and precuneus against atrophy (<u>no reduction at all</u>, vs control did decrease in gray matter there (did they mean "white"?))
- improvements in white matter integrity
#### How exercise does it
- stimulates neural growth factor
- promotes global (whole body) disinflammation via its mobilization of T-cells
- this is true for any physical exercise
	- pro-inflammatory proteins released (during aging, I guess) increase risk of dementia by causing chemicals that eventually kill brain cells
	- author's currently analyzing irisin and BDNF chemicals stimulated by muscle contraction 
		- ? so weight training stimulates more of them?
		- anyway the paper itself says increased muscle strength related to better cognitive perf, or a lack of degradation.
