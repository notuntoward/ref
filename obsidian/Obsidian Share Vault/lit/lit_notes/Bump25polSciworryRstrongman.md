It's clear that the Rs don't care about democracy anywhere near as much as the Ds.  Also good data sources.

### Democracy and authoritarianism vs. party

Over half of the R's wouldn't mind a single elected strongman with no congress, while about 45% of Trump supporters wouldn't mind a pure dictator!  Looks like ~97% of like democracy and ~27% wouldn't mind a dictator (which also seems high).

The R's strongly approve of Trump's anti-democratic actions, *because* they affect democracy.  Luckily, most of both groups still think democracy is a "good" or "fairly good" a system of government, but 55% of Trump supporters say strongman, no congress leaders are good or fairly good.

Looking at Trump-caused events rated by a group of political scientists as serious or extraordinary threats to democracy, around 75% of R's *approve*!  They approved of no late actions (I suppose shaky) by Biden, none of which were rated as serious democracy threats.

### Data Sources
- [ ] [[BrightLineWatch25accelTrnsgrssnTrump|BrightLineWatch25: Accelerated transgressions in the second Trump presidency | Bright Line Watch]] : **way** more interesting detail than what made it into Bump's article.  Worth looking into sometime
