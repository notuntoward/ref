Huge deficit buster bill passed by house reps in May 2025.  Vast majority of deficit contribution is due to tax cuts.  Deficit reductions due to social, Medicaid, and climate  cuts are tiny in comparison.  Good graphs (snipped from web page below).  Huge tax cuts and huge increase in deficit.  Total R deficit hypocrisy.
### Budget Nastinesses
- 2017 tax cut extension
	- benefits concentrated on wealthy
	- biz tax cuts made permanent, while individual tax cuts expire in one year (so won't loss in time for 2026 mid-terms, I guess)
- Medicaid cuts: 8.7M lose coverage; 7.6M more uninsured (in next 10 years)
- non-citizens denied child tax credit (doesn't matter if they paid taxes)
- New University tax: 1.4-21% 
- tax cuts for private/home schooling @ same time as proposals to eliminate the Dept. of Education.
- remove Biden's EV tax credit, also clean energy incentives (Not clear from article thae later is in there).  At the same time as mandating new oil and gas on public lands
- Federal worker protections removed: must choose between protections (not at will) or being able to save less for retirement
- Raise the debt limit to $4T while the bill cuts, while cutting taxes by about $4.3T 
- $1T of tax cuts go to > $1M earners: [Trump Pushes DISASTER Bill and...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4)
