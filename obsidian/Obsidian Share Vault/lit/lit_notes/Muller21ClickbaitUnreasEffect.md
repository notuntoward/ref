%% begin Obsidian Notes %%
___
Good titles and thumbnails, in the experience of Veritasium, make a huge difference in # of views (one from being on track to being one of his worst to his best, with 14M or something like that views).  Says there are two axes of clickbait:

1. withholding information to drive curiosity
2. sensationalism

Overdoing both is egregious, but he says that doing them the right amount has driven him to produce more accurate titles that were also more successful.

He does this with A/B testing, where his team of "a couple bright people" try combinations of captions and videos and test them.  Mr. Breast, who I gather has a video with 40M views concurs.
