> **Abstract**
> Ancillary services have been a key component of  storage revenue stacks since batteries began coming  online, turbocharging returns for some operating  projects. However, this turbocharger has already  started to wane in CAISO and ERCOT and serves as  a harbinger for ancillary decline in other markets.  This decline is consistent with Ascend Analytics’  forecast of ancillary service prices, highlighting the  growing importance of geographic location and  bidding strategy as value drivers for storage projects  as revenues shift from ancillary services to energy  arbitrage.

**I don't understand this thing.  Read later and maybe then it will make sense.**

In both CAISO and ERCOT, ancillary service prices are dropping relative to energy prices -- evidence given for energy prices for SP15 (trading hub in S. CA).  Figure 1.

Figure 2 shows energy prices relative to ancillary service prices steadily increase with system-wide battery capacity until capacity goes beyond the size of the AS market.  It's not clear, but if this is "both energy and AS sold by batteries," then it means that *energy* prices drop relative to energy, which is the fricking *opposite* of what the previous paragraph says
