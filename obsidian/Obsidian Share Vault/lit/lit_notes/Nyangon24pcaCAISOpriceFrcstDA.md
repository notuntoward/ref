> Abstract             Electricity price forecasting is crucial for grid management, renewable energy integration, power system planning, and price volatility management. However, poor accuracy due to complex generation mix data and heteroskedasticity poses a challenge for utilities and grid operators. This paper evaluates advanced analytics methods that utilize principal component analysis (PCA) to improve forecasting accuracy amidst heteroskedastic noise. Drawing on the experience of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), a leading producer of renewable electricity, the study analyzes hourly electricity prices and demand data from 2016 to 2021 to assess the impact of day‐ahead forecasting on California's evolving generation mix. To enhance data quality, traditional outlier analysis using the interquartile range (IQR) method is first applied, followed by a novel supervised PCA technique called robust PCA (RPCA) for more effective outlier detection and elimination. The combined approach significantly improves data symmetry and reduces skewness. Multiple linear regression models are then constructed to forecast electricity prices using both raw and transformed features obtained through PCA. Results demonstrate that the model utilizing transformed features, after outlier removal using the traditional method and SAS Sparse Matrix method, achieves the highest forecasting performance. Notably, the SAS Sparse Matrix outlier removal method, implemented via proc RPCA, greatly contributes to improved model accuracy. This study highlights that PCA methods enhance electricity price forecasting accuracy, facilitating the integration of renewables like solar and wind, thereby aiding grid management and promoting renewable growth in day‐ahead markets.
