## Raw Video Notes
- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=116#t=01:55.80) Intro
- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=209#t=03:29.19) Thought that AI wouldn't replace creativity.  Thought that AI progress would replace:
	- blue collar
	- white collar
	- creative
- but that didn't happen like that
- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=368#t=06:07.82) Fourpotbot LLM comparison tool
	- prompt activated @ same time on N AIs
	- can see latency
	- can see risk aversion approach, don't want to answer the question
- [ ] # [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=498#t=08:17.82) What he thinks are biz apps: add these to [[Gen AI Talk Ideas]]
![[lit/lit_notes/attachments/920761842d66b935232047583791d128_MD5.jpeg]]


- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=548#t=09:08.12) optimizing price strategy: 
	- AI is good @ making summarizes of research, I think, that tell you how to set it
- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=578#t=09:37.58) synthetic data: 
	- ask AI question, get answer like real consumers would tell you.
	- esp. good for small countries e.g. Belgium
	- [ ] # AI good a representing average consumer: add this to creativity part of [[Gen AI Talk Ideas]]
		- [ ] **But**: Henry Ford phrase: "If he'd asked his customers what they wanted, the would have said faster horses"
		- not good at "leading users" or what role you company could play in future
- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=668#t=11:07.90) Baby steps AI
	- train AI to see what a baby sees:
![[lit/lit_notes/attachments/4fad7cbdfdefd610b638ebfa48163c95_MD5.jpeg]]

- AI learned "chair" and "ball"
- Simulated rooms e.g. Pampers demo room w/ oversized furniture, to give you a baby's view
- AI good and cost effective in giving (visual) simulations e.g. architects in [[Gen AI Talk Ideas]]
- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=748#t=12:27.71) His Koenbot: everything he's said, written, been on video
	- chatbot answers in voice w/ his simulated voice
	- says its precise, gives references, so I guess it's a RAG [[Gen AI Talk Ideas]]
	- he programmed it to ask follow-up questions so can stimulate other ideas, hone search further
	- hallucinations: sets creativity quotient to limit (set it to "5").  Also option to use ONLY from published research
- [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=1030#t=17:09.52) Car ads
	- fed AI all existing ads
	- AI generated adverts
	- humans scored them
	- On average AI ads scored better than human
	- Also better at every stage of the "purchase funnel"
- [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=1112#t=18:31.95) Air Canada screwup (article [[Belanger24airCanadaChatbot]])
	- not sure what his point was...
- [00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=1187#t=19:47.41) personalized shopping advice based on images of shopper when they enter the store
- [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=1211#t=20:10.74) towards the feeling economy
	- currently at the thinking economy (supplementing or replacing thinking jobs)
	- e.g. Robots helping elderly getting out of rooms and exercising
	- AI bot s/b considerate, observant, ...
- [00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=1293#t=21:32.99) Needed AI improvements
	- summarized by "Altman".  I suppose Sam Altman
	- accuracy
	- customization to user's assumptions, worldviews
	- safe way to use your own data
- [00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=1354#t=22:33.86) Democracy
	- Thinks future is human+AI
	- need to reorg companies.  
	- not sure what his point was
- [00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=1399#t=23:18.51) Serendipity
	- give user what he/she asks for
	- but also suggest/give one more thing, for novel discovery, being less boring
- [00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=1460#t=24:20.33) Auto MMM
	- Marketing advice
	- estimate all reasonable models
	- human expertise (coded into model output selection?)
	- open source:  from MMM labs
- [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXevyoeUD8&t=1696#t=28:15.82) Consumer preference: Accuracy vs. Creativity
	- says have research on this
	- explainable AI needed, including sources.
