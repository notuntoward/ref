Continually updated political polls and economic data.  Screen snapshot is from 6/30/25.

#### Strength in Numbers Index of US Economic Growth

Tries to predict the GDP changes that affect political outcomes.  Kind of a weird idea, maybe this is a joint prediction?  Has code: [[Morris25econIndexTracker|Morris25: Economic-data-tracker]].

Predicts econ growth similar to two Fed Bank GDP quarterly nowcasts:
- [New York Fed Staff Nowcast](https://resources.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/nowcast/#nowcast/2025:Q2)
- [Atlanta GDPNow  - Federal Reserve Bank](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow)

But this predicts *yearly* economic growth (index) based purely on features selected by:
- individual correlation with change in political support (of president?)
- ability of resulting index to predict change in political support

- [ ] ? If the idea is to look at econ factors that affect voting, wouldn't using something like a Shapley coefficient e.g. [[Bordt23nShapleyValsGnrlzd|Bordt23: From Shapley Values to Generalized Additive Models and back]] from a trained model be better?
