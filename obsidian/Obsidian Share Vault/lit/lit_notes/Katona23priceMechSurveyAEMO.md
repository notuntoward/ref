> **Abstract**
> The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is an energy-only zonal instance of the integrated pool model without a day-ahead market where a security-constrained economic- dispatch (SCED) engine controls dispatch and sets the price every 5 minutes. After a brief overview of pool markets across the world, this paper provides a detailed description of the NEM market design and price mechanism, drawn from a multitude of industry publications and the available auction data. Then to elucidate the NEM Dispatch Engine’s process of wholesale price determination, a bid stack–type modelling framework is constructed from first principles with its suitability and limitations discussed against real-world examples from the NEM’s SCED mechanism.

I thought this was a new and current paper explaining how prices are set, as it was referenced in [NEMSEER docs](https://nemseer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html#id23). However, View explained that it doesn't explain this, and couldn't understand the description of the bid stack for dual fueled generators (e.g. batteries) either.  The actual current approach (2024) is in [[AEMO21schedLoadGuide|Guide to Scheduled Loads]]
