Issues where Americans actually agree -- they're perceived non-partisan with easily understood solutions.  "Agreement Issues" could be another interesting thing a dashboard could monitor -- better than a total vote count because messaging on "agreement issues" if they're "salient," might gain more.
### What agreement issues have in common

- not perceived to be owned by any party
- have clear solutions: the voter can see how it would work, so it's easier to trust a candidate on it, even if not from your party. Examples:
	- tax credits
	- bans
	- subsidies
### How to use agreement issues
(according to me)

You'd have to be careful, because, the article says, people agree on them because they're not considered to be owned by the other party.  The message would maybe be something like "we all agree that AI is a danger:  Here is my plan." And maybe don't mention the R opponent.
### Actual Agreement Issues
(didn't get clipped by SingleFile so there they are)

- unity
- worker training tax credit
- business credit for family and medical leave
- social media age restrictions
- ADI
#### Poll Results on Agreement Isues
