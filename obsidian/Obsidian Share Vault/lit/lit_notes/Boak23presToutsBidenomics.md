___

Biden had a 34% approval on the econ in June 2023 (41% overall), even though 3.7% unemployment was a historic low, and inflation had fallen to 4% (still higher than target);  60% of D's approved while 10% of R's approved (vs. pandemic unemp. during Trump and the R "overwhelming" approval).

30% said the econ was good, in spite of Biden's data-driven argument e.g. inflation lower than rest of G7.  So even Ds had some perception problems (or did they?  [[Ludwig25votersCorrectEcon|Ludwig25: Voters Were Right About the econ]])
