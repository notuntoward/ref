>> **Abstract**
> The 2024 general election was a major opportunity for youth to exercise their democratic rights, use their political voices, and shape the future of the country.  As part of our work to understand young people’s civic learning and participation, we have been tracking major trends about the youth vote and sharing key data on election week about young people’s participation, priorities, and choices at the ballot box.
