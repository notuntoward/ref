The Ds lost considerable union voters while the Rs have gained -- in 2024, Trump had a 26% lean among un-degreed white union voters, and the Hispanic union voter support for D’s dropped by 35%.  Black Asian and Latino voters have shifted red in the last decade.  There are three explanations, one that the D’s have not materially supported workers with policy; that both R and D voters have become postmaterialist, voting on non-economic or defense issues, and instead on social and cultural aspects; and bad D candidates.  Based on history, the author predicts that D’s will pick up 5-9 points in 2026, but says that D’s need a few (and _only_ a few) simple-to-understand kitchen table policies -- and _perhaps_ to showily reject for left positions -- in order to attract the voters the lost in 2024
## I. Post Materialism and cultural issues

- 1st time: R coalition less wealthy than D coalition
- non-material priorities
	 - D’s vote on climate change, racial equality
	 - non-college voters on immigration, abortion and race
- alienating positions
	 - abortion: worked for the D’s in 2022; failed in 2024 (voters interested in “other issues”)
	 - immigration: D position alienated Latinos, who cared more about kitchen table issues, but *isn’t that “materialistic,” not post-materialistic?*
	 - unnamed D positions are more alienating (than immigration?) for small-c conservative Americans (traditionalists who resist change, but aren’t conservative (R) party members. Are these more persuadable for D’s than big C’s?)
- D’s far more educated and socially liberal than general public
- How to win on cultural issues
	 - How not to: Harris’s gun owner talking point had no impact
	 - How to:
		 - loudly rejecting some far-left D positions:  Fetterman, Gallego, Gluesekamp, Perez.
			 - but it’s also pointed out that this could alienate the D base
		 - save some coal plants???
## II. The argument for a Materialist explanation

- high prices listed as top concern
- D headlines on GDP growth , inequality, jobs, wages, inflation reduction did not dent voters’ trust in Trump (so bad D campaigns?)
- D’s shut down coal plant jobs
- Voter thought that the D’s were ignoring/gaslighting them (really?  For some this was true XXX, but was this just an excuse, justifying a cultural, postmaterialist position?)
	 - anyway, Harris should have criticized Biden’s inflationary policies (but maybe she was just being honest?)
	 - is said to have cost her votes, maybe election, as inflation did for incumbents around the world.
- Biden fumbled in explaining all his huge pro-labor infrastructure policies
	 - quote: “While voters across party lines strongly supported Biden’s populist economic policies, many were not aware that his administration had enacted them,”
	 - voters got specifics from Trump (tariffs, etc.); it wasn’t clear to voters what Harris stood for.
## III. Bad Candidates

- Biden’s age
- Harris’s lack of an “authentic connection to voters”
- D messaging about Trump’s bad character did not work for some unnamed reason
## IV. Kitchen Table Policies

- “ bill that caps the price of all prescription drugs at $25 a month, say, rather than a 19-point [policy white paper](https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf).”
- **working class** “kitchen table”
	 - **prefer predistribution to distribution**
		 - high min wage, not welfare
		 - pro-union, not refundable tax credits
		 - antitrust, not food stamps
		 - for moderate income voters: infrastructure-like spending e.g. pre-K, guaranteed jobs, public internet
