>> **Abstract**
> This study aimed to investigate the effects of a comprehensive corrective exercise program on the kyphosis angle and balance in kyphotic adolescents. A total of 62 male adolescents (between the ages of 10 and 18, mean BMI 21.7 kg/m2) with a thoracic kyphosis (TK) angle of ≥ 50° were divided into three groups using the simple randomization method: CCEP (comprehensive corrective exercise program), TEP (thoracic exercise program) and control group. The CCEP program consisted of corrective exercises plus postural perception training (PPT). Exercise programs were applied for 40−50 min, 3 days a week for 12 weeks. The kyphosis angle was measured using a flexible ruler, and balance was assessed using the Romberg index obtained from pedobarography. After training, a highly significant reduction in the kyphosis angle was observed in the CCEP and TEP groups (p < 0.001). Comparison among the groups showed a greater reduction in the kyphosis angle in the CCEP group (p < 0.020). Postural perception improved in the CCEP group versus other groups (p < 0.001). Improvement of the Romberg index (balance) was found only in the CCEP group upon within-group comparison (p < 0.001), with no difference among the groups (p > 0.05). The use of postural perception in combination with corrective exercise programs for thoracic kyphosis represents a comprehensive approach, and PPT can increase the effectiveness of the intervention.

CCEP (comprehensive corrective exercise program) as in [[Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP|Elpeze22: null]] [[Seidi14hyperKyposisExrcsEffic|Seidi14: The efficiency of corrective exercise interventions on thoracic hyper-kyphosis angle]], is better than TEP (thoracic exercise program) and a control.
### CCEP improvements
- best reduction in the kyphosis angle
- Best postural perception improvement
- Best and only improvement of the Romberg index (balance)
### Exercises
