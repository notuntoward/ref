>> **Abstract**
> This study aimed to investigate the effects of a comprehensive corrective exercise program on the kyphosis angle and balance in kyphotic adolescents. A total of 62 male adolescents (between the ages of 10 and 18, mean BMI 21.7 kg/m2) with a thoracic kyphosis (TK) angle of ≥ 50° were divided into three groups using the simple randomization method: CCEP (comprehensive corrective exercise program), TEP (thoracic exercise program) and control group. The CCEP program consisted of corrective exercises plus postural perception training (PPT). Exercise programs were applied for 40−50 min, 3 days a week for 12 weeks. The kyphosis angle was measured using a flexible ruler, and balance was assessed using the Romberg index obtained from pedobarography. After training, a highly significant reduction in the kyphosis angle was observed in the CCEP and TEP groups (p < 0.001). Comparison among the groups showed a greater reduction in the kyphosis angle in the CCEP group (p < 0.020). Postural perception improved in the CCEP group versus other groups (p < 0.001). Improvement of the Romberg index (balance) was found only in the CCEP group upon within-group comparison (p < 0.001), with no difference among the groups (p > 0.05). The use of postural perception in combination with corrective exercise programs for thoracic kyphosis represents a comprehensive approach, and PPT can increase the effectiveness of the intervention.

CCEP (comprehensive corrective exercise program) as in [[Seidi14hyperKyposisExrcsEffic]], combined with [postural perception training](Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=5&annotation=548R), is better than TEP (thoracic exercise program) and a control.  The exercise routine is pretty time intensive.
### Results: CCEP + posture
- best reduction in the kyphosis angle
- Best postural perception improvement
- Best and only balance improvement (Romberg index)
### Exercises
- [[Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=5&annotation=551R|40–50 min, 3 days a week for 12 week]]
- Reps/mins vs. Week in Program: [Appendix A](Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=12&annotation=243R)
- Exercise Progression vs. Week in Program: [Appendix B](Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=12&annotation=244R)
- [[Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=5&annotation=548R|Postural perception training]]: instructed about what good posture is, checks in mirror
- More exercises than [[Seidi14hyperKyposisExrcsEffic|Seidi14hyperKyposisExrcsEffic]] , and maybe different, judging by pictures.
- Exercise pictures (unclear what is what, though): [Figure 2](Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=12&annotation=244R)

### Exercise Program Progression
- [[Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=5&annotation=551R|40–50 min, 3 days a week for 12 week]] (max across 12 week program, since num/dur of exercises increases?)
#### Exercise Times/Reps/Duration 
Seems to be organized into supersets, each of which rotates through all exercises in [Appendix B](Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=12&annotation=244R).  The "Exercises" column in [Appendix A](Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=12&annotation=243R) seems to be (num. exercises in  [Appendix B](Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=12&annotation=244R)) X (num. repeats of supersets) (see [this](Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=5&annotation=166R), but actually, **I can't figure this out**)
##### Definition: stretching vs. self-mobilization
Different reps/durs for these types, which aren't defined, but I can use [this](Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=5&annotation=554R) to guess.
- there are both supine and standing versions of pec stretch and thorcic self-mobilizations (4 exercises in [[Elpeze22kyphosisAdolescCCEP.pdf#page=6&annotation=557R|Figure 2.]])
- but **I still can't figure it out**
##### Superset 
- stretching: 30 s x 3 reps  **1.5 mins**
- self-mobilization: 60 s x 2 reps **2 mins**
##### Superset repeats
