Trump won because of economic and identity insecurity.  COVID and post-COVID inflation eroded sense of self-control, which wiped out any kind of incumbent around the world.  There was also cultural/identity insecurity.  Both these have been stoked by many actors, including by big KGB budgets (great video clips of this), politicians, and the new Russian, etc. "KGBs."  

His solution is to create a kind of AI polling and policy proposing, which he hopes will help legislators do their jobs, and will people feel more in control -- somehow, this is more local control?

He's written a book on Trump, plans to write more about his AI idea.  Interesting...

- Reasons given:
	- insecurity
		- economic
			- from COVID
			- then from resulting inflation
			- incumbents wiped out in democracies around the world, regardless of party: Biden in US, conservatives in the UK
		- identity, cultural
			- guy says its a result of planned efforts by many entities
				- [Interesting video of KGB defector Yuri Bexmenov](https://youtu.be/074gEsTCLMY?t=342)
				- says **only 15% of KGB spent on espionage**; rest on overt campaigns anybody could see.
			- Trump offered a cure that was a toxin: joining him put them in superior category (MAGA), put them in control again
				- but this was really "extending" securities
				- created a community, hadn't seen that in hears
				- created an "out" group to look down on
- How to get Trump supporters back to reality
	- What KGB says [you can't change their minds, as KGB planned](https://youtu.be/074gEsTCLMY?t=752)
		- authentic info won't help
		- it's irreversible
	- This guy thinks you actually can do something about them
		- his example BREXIT
			- Pro-BREXIT slogan: "take back control" (from EU)
			- tapped into real feeling that don't have control (more of this coming in future, techno advances, etc.)
		- solution: deepen democracy, local control, **via AI!**
			- says AI can harvest opinions
			- distill a consensus agreeable to the majority
			- so I guess this is **AI polling** 
			- an enhanced feedback group
			- says this will answer the insecurity
			- he's writing a book about it
			- In a way, I just realized, this kinda worked, as Google's AI found this video for me, and I was truly interested in it
			- couldn't this just as easily increase polarization?
