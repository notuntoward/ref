It's long been thought that thinking without words is impossible, but new research suggests that most thinking uses non-language parts of the brain, and no words at all.  This may be why LLMs aren't good at thinking.  They're trained on language, and may now be learning to mimic how words are connected together -- the human brain language network, so they're very fluent, but aren't thinking.  What languages are tuned for is communication.
# They/them is a language fail
Gender neutral they/them is annoying: grammars are tuned over centuries for efficient communication, with minimal cognitive load, especially the most common words. They/them messes up this design with its ambiguity, and this is with the most commonly used words!  Dumb.
# Points
- Evidence Brain scans
	- [[Zimmer24thinkNeedLanguage.pdf#page=2&annotation=190R|certain brain regions that became active only when volunteers processed actual language]]
	- language areas stay in the same brain location, but (it seems although they don't say so) that they are different for different people.  Anyway, "[[Zimmer24thinkNeedLanguage.pdf#page=2&annotation=193R|“If I scan you today, and 10 or 15 years later, it’s going to be in the same place]]"
	- brain scans during diverse thinking tasks, like puzzles, make the brain work hard, but [[Zimmer24thinkNeedLanguage.pdf#page=2&annotation=199R|none of those things seem to engage language circuits]]
- Evidence from Brain injuries
	- people with brain injuries may have [[Zimmer24thinkNeedLanguage.pdf#page=2&annotation=215R|aphasia]] but [[Zimmer24thinkNeedLanguage.pdf#page=2&annotation=218R|can still do algebra  and  play chess]]
- Evidence that language is designed for communication
	- [[Zimmer24thinkNeedLanguage.pdf#page=3&annotation=233R|frequently used words are shorter,]]
	- [[Zimmer24thinkNeedLanguage.pdf#page=3&annotation=239R|rules of grammar put words close to each other]]
	- LLMs seem to be imitating language: [[Zimmer24thinkNeedLanguage.pdf#page=3&annotation=265R|very fluent grammatical text that may or may not have coherent underlying thought]]
