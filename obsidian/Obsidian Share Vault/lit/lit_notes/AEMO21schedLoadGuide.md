> **Abstract**
> Under the Rules, scheduled loads are net consumers of electricity that register to participate in the central dispatch and pricing processes operated by AEMO.  For the purposes of economic scheduling of electricity to meet demand, scheduled loads are essentially  treated on equal terms with scheduled generating units with no dispatch models designed to favour  scheduling from one type of unit over another. In this document the models described for scheduled loads equally apply for scheduled generating units unless otherwise specified.  Furthermore, the same participant interfaces are available for the bidding, dispatch and market reporting of scheduled generating units and scheduled loads.  However, market participants with registered scheduled loads should specifically be aware of:  - The expected structure of their dispatch bids and how the central dispatch process interprets these  bids;  - Market ancillary services offer data and how the central dispatch process interprets this data;  - The other data required by the central dispatch process;  - Modelling in the dispatch algorithm that is specific to scheduled loads;  - The interpretation of load dispatch instructions.

View says this is the current AEMO price forecasting practice ([[2024-03-13#View meeting on AEMO bid stack]]).  It was not, as I thought, [[Katona23priceMechSurveyAEMO|A Price Mechanism Survey of the Australian National Electricity Market]]
