Many interesting things (left in my browser tabs, for now), but, more of a comment

Just as Zak volunteered/confessed after interrogation:

- then [specific data at a lower learning rate](https://youtu.be/Kk8YhCpo1b8?t=1291)
- learning rate in combination w/ sequence of data “[seems to be quite an important piece in training these language models](https://youtu.be/Kk8YhCpo1b8?t=1307).”
- another leaderboard: [berkeley function calling leaderboard.](https://youtu.be/Kk8YhCpo1b8?t=1478) Important for agent models.  Claude3 is on top
- I think the air canada bereavement is in here.  
	- [[Nakajima23GenAIResearch.html]] says so.
	- notes w/ this might have been in a Kilcher24mlNewsYouTube240402 that I can no longer find, probably deleted
	- here's the original article: [[Belanger24airCanadaChatbot]]
