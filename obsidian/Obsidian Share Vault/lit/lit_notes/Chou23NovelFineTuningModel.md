> **Abstract**
> Future capacity prediction of lithium-ion batteries is a highly researched topic in the field of battery management systems, owing to the gradual degradation of battery capacity over time due to various factors such as chemical changes within the battery, usage patterns, and operating conditions. The accurate prediction of battery capacity can aid in optimizing its usage, extending its lifespan, and mitigating the risk of unforeseen failures. In this paper, we proposed a novel fine-tuning model based on a deep learning model with a transfer learning approach comprising of two key components: offline training and online prediction. Model weights and prediction parameters were transferred from offline training using source data to the online prediction stage. The transferred Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory with an Attention Mechanism model weights and prediction parameters were utilized to fine-tune the model by partial target data in the online prediction phase. Three battery batches with different charging policy were used to evaluate the proposed approach‚Äôs robustness, reliability, usability, and accuracy for the three charging policy batteries‚Äô real-world data. The experiment results show that the proposed method‚Äôs efficacy improved, with an increase in the cycle number of the starting point, exhibiting a linear relationship with the starting point. The proposed method yields relative error values of 8.70%, 6.38%, 9.52%, 7.58%, 1.94%, and 2.29%, respectively, for the six target batteries in online prediction. Thus, the proposed method is effective in predicting the future capacity of lithium-ion batteries and holds potential for use in predictive maintenance applications.
