ERCOT and CAISO take different generation incentivization approaches, but renewables and cheap NG have caused such low prices that the incentives are insufficient, and capacity markets aren't helping. 

*Note*: I can't find a date for this article so it might be a little obsolete -- latest year given 2016, well after the Texas winter disaster during storm Uri, in XX.

# ERCOT
- incentives
	- no capacity payments
	- max energy price of $9k/MWh
- pricing result
	- never > $1K/MWh (it got there in storm Uri, I think)
	- other prices spikes limited
		- $300 for 22 hrs
	- neg prices for 133 hrs
- NG avg revenues:$23-29 / kW-year
	- not even enough for existing gen (marginal cost, I guess)
	- new gen build needs $80-$96 per kW-year
- 3 coal plants retiring
# CAISO
- incentives
	- a "limited" competitive retail market
	- competitive wholesale market
	- no formal capacity auction
	- interconnects: PNW, AZ, NV
	- non-bid capacity procurement in one year chunks
- pricing result
	- - insufficient to attract new dispatchable generation
# Conclusions

Ancillary prices are insufficient to ensure generator profitability; capacity payments not enough to attract new generation.
