> ​no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success – at least not north of 120.​

**Note:**

---
> ​What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004).​

**Note:**

---
> ​Willpower is, as far as we know today,[2] a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, and Tice, 1998; Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister, 1998; Schmeichel, Vohs, and Baumeister, 2003; Moller, 2006).​

> ​Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time.​

---
> ​“I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.”​

**Note:**

---
> ​that self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2)​

---
> ​A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975).​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 6


---
> ​The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 6


---
> ​Having read more does not automatically mean having more ideas. Especially in the beginning, it means having fewer ideas to work with, because you know that others have already thought of most of them.​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 7


---
> ​simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. There is quite extensive empirical and logical research on this phenomenon (for an overview: cf. Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015).​

**Note:**

---
> ​They sort their notes by topics and sub-topics, which makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes very complicated. Plus, it reduces the likelihood of building and finding surprising connections​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 9


---
> ​Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 10


---
> ​Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly (cf. Mata, Todd, and Lippke, 2010).​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 10


---
> ​GTD never really caught on in academia, although it is very successful in business and has a good reputation among the self-employed.​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 11


---
> ​GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition.​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 11


---
> ​GTD requires projects to be broken down into smaller, concrete “next steps.”​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 11


---
> ​successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 11


---
> ​not necessarily the context it was taken from.​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 13


---
> ​one note was only as valuable as its context,​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 13


---
> ​“I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.”​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 15


---
> ​it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea.​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 16


---
> ​that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998).​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 18


---
> ​Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the​

---
> ​Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 20


---
> ​Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas,​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 22


---
> ​If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. And if we have to write anyway, why not use our writing to build up the resources for our future publications?​

**Note:** 
**Location:** Page: 23
