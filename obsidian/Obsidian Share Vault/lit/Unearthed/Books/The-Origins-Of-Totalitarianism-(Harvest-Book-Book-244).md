> <div style="background-color: #4682b4; padding: 12px;">​There is hardly an aspect of contemporary history more irritating and mystifying than the fact that of all the great unsolved political questions of our century, it should have been this seemingly small and unimportant Jewish problem that had the dubious honor of setting the whole infernal machine in motion.​</div>

But one should also bear in mind that lack of political ability and judgment have been caused by the very nature of Jewish history,​</div>
