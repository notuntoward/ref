I've written stuff to download and send timestamped [[Zotero to Obsidian to RAG#YouTube Transcripts to NotebookLM|YouTube Transcripts to NotebookLM]], but what I really want is them to be in Obsidian Literature Notes.  I haven't found a [[Zotero 6 to 7|Zotero]] plugin that can do this, but there are many Obsidian ones. 
# Transcription interfaces to Obsidian
There are [a few Obsidian methods](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-there-an-obsidian-plugin-th-DAp4uTevSx6NOF8DuMegZQ?0=d#0) can download YouTube transcripts.

- [[Dailies/2025-03-27.md#YTranscript Plugin |YTranscript Plugin]]: pretty good
- [[Dailies/2025-03-27.md#Transcription Plugin |Transcription Plugin]]: transcribe from files, though, though interesting
- [Glasp browser plugin](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-import-youtube-videos-transcripts-no-need-to-write-down-while-watching/44459): shows you the transcript as you watch.  
	- can only copy what you highlight to markdown
	- or *everything*
	- Guy uses it with [[2024-04-03#Media Extended plugin]]
- [[Dailies/2025-03-27.md#YouTube Summarizer Plugin |YouTube Summarizer Plugin]]
	- uses OpenAI to paste a summary into your notes
	- not transcripts, though.  Interesting?
	- Using Obsidian [[Dailies/2025-03-03.md#Companion Plugin and YouTube summarizer|Note Companion and YouTube summarizer]] somehow
- [[Dailies/2025-03-27.md#YouTube Video Summarizer Plugin |YouTube Video Summarizer Plugin]]
	- like [[2025-03-27#YouTube Summarizer Plugin]] but Google Gemini (free)
	- Interesting?
- [Create Perfect Summaries of Vi...](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/create-perfect-summaries-of-video-transcripts-with-ai-for-free/96851)
- Firefox: [youtube-transcript-to-obsidian...](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-transcript-to-obsidian/)
- [VidSumGPT](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-import-youtube-videos-transcripts-no-need-to-write-down-while-watching/44459): fee-per-month service summarizes many things, but can it give you clickable transcripts?
- [you-tldr.com](http://you-tldr.com/): paid youtube summarizer
- Just use my python stuff?
# Append transcript onto end of Obsidian Lit Note?
- maybe as a callout?
- is inconsistent with pdf, html, etc. attachment approach
- not directly visible in Zotero (although you could just open the obsidian note)
# Add a transcript attachment to an Obsidian note?
- editing markdown would be messy
- ? Then add that attachment back to Zotero
	- pyzotero is so slow...
