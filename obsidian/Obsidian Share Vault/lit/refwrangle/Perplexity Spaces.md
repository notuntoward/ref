A [[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]] system comparable to Google's [[NotebookLM|NotebookLM]]
### My uses

#### Refwrangle uses for Perplexity Spaces
I'm going to save my perplexity searches in a Space, so that I don't lose them if my browser crashes and loses all my perplexity tabs.  
- I'm probably going to save them as markdown and put them in obsidian (but not allow them to be AI'ed by Smart Connections
- [ ] @ Then I'll edit them to replace the numbered references with references items I've downloaded into my zotero DB
	- [ ] ? Is this a zotero citekey or an obsidian zotero note?
### Limitations
Perplexity Spaces have several restrictions and limitations regarding file uploads and queries:

#### File Upload Restrictions

Perplexity Pro users can upload up to 50 files per Space[9]. The supported file types for Internal Knowledge Search include:

- Excel (XLSX)
- PowerPoint (PPTX)
- Word (DOCX)
- CSV

Each file can be up to 25 MB in size[9]. While PNG and JPEG files cannot be uploaded as sources in a Space, users can still attach these image files directly to their queries[9].

#### Query Limitations

For free users, Pro Search is limited to five times every four hours. Pro subscribers get access to over 300 Pro Searches per day[9].

#### File Upload Limits

The total number of files that can be uploaded varies depending on the subscription level:

- Perplexity Pro users: Up to 50 files per Space[9]
- Enterprise Pro users: Up to 500 files total[10]

It's worth noting that these limits may be subject to change, as the company has indicated they might expand the file upload limit in the future[10].

#### Additional Considerations

- Free users can create and use Spaces to organize Threads and collaborate with others, but only Pro or Enterprise Pro subscribers can upload files and use them as sources in their searches[9].
- Users can choose to search files, the web, or both when making queries within a Space[9].
- Titles and summaries for uploaded files are auto-generated by a language model, which may contain inaccuracies[9].

These restrictions ensure efficient use of the platform while providing flexibility for different user needs and subscription levels.
