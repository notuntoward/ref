An exhibit had a pump ([[Pfeiffer old pump user manual.pdf|Old 4RJ39 manual]]) powering a shower, and the motor burned out.   He replaced it with a new model ([[Pfeiffer new pump user manual.pdf|New 3YU60A manual]]) there was too much pressure and blew the shower curtains and splattered on the floor.  What can he do?|

The pumps were both 115V/60Hz single phase, and the new one (I think both) has a split capacitor motor with a centrifugal start.  Motor tech at the pump seller ([Grainger](https://www.grainger.com/product/Universal-Thermostat-Guard-4NE39)) says this can't be controlled by changing voltage or freq. (would cause it to burn out)

They do carry an (expensive) pump/motor that seems like it would be a reasonable replacement.

- Granger Tech support 
	- Motor tech (Robert??) 
		- says that you can't control it because it's designed to start with 115/60 Hz and won't be able to start if you give it something else, and will burn out because it can't get up to speed or something like that.
		- There is some kind of single phase motor that could be controlled but it's rare, and I gather they don't carry it.
		- Would be hard to find a separate pump that connects to a motor they've got b/c of bolt patterns, so I guess need to buy a complete pump/motor package.
	- Pump tech: (Daryll): he had two options that would be in the pressure/gpm range
		- Pump 5HFA6: pressure controller, 2.9-13.4 gpm, fixed 25-38 psi
			- it's about 6 psi below the new pump's psi.
			- 115 V
			- Could be in NYC Thursday
			- $853
			- pump controls gpm by constricting flow, so he said you can't control pressure
				- but he said the pressure ranged over 25-39 psi, so it does change, and I'd guess that this depends on height (resistance to flow)
				- so it seems to me that there's some wiggle room to adjust the PSI with the shower head.
		- some other model for $22k and 30 days out, I think he said.
