The basement lighting partly runs on ungrounded metal shrouded cables (MC), which have to be replaced; fluorescent fixture wiring isn't code compliant; and some fixtures are broken. The stairs have no lights (out of compliance), and the basement is generally dim.  

Garage receptacles must be isolated on their own dedicated 20 A circuit, although they can be connected to a *to-be-installed* S. wall exterior receptacle.  Currently, they are connected to 15 A circuit, which runs through garage lights and also a laundry receptacle -- which itself, has to be on its own dedicated 20 A circuit.

When this job is done, the result will be compliant 20A receptacles, and a new, mostly Romex 15A lighting circuit, which covers the basement, basement stairs, and the garage.  All will be visible in pleasant, new lighting.

# Prep

Clear the work area, when necessary, getting stuff out of the way by moving it to the garage.

# Fixtures
1. Remove fluorescent strip lights
2. remove the two single-bulb fixtures by the laundry and in the W basement end Lx
3. install 4 LED strip lights, 3 over the shop (Lx, Ly and Lz) and one over the washing machine Lx.
4. install four single-bulb ceiling fixtures 
	1. two running between stairs and furnace: Lx and Lx
	2. two on W basement side: Lx and Lx
5. install two stair lights: Lx and Ly
6. convert the single gang garage door switch box, Lx, to a 2 gang switch, with one switch operating the garage doors; the other, the stair lights.  The stair light switch in Lx will be two-way with the upper basement stair switch Lx.  The garage switch is already two-way with the exterior garage door switch, Lx.
7. convert the upper basement stair switch, Lx, to a two-light switch with Ly.  New Romex replaces the ungrounded MC.  The easiest way to do this is probably to also replace the old metal box with an interior plastic old work box.
8. Add new 3 gang switch, Lx, to post at bottom of stairs.  The first switch controls the laundry strip LED light; the second, the group of three shop LED strip lights, Lx, Ly, and Lz; and the third, the four bare bulb fixtures Lx, Lx, Lx and Lx
9. convert the current shop 4 gang box to a 3 gang box, with 4 receptacles and one switch which controls the three shop LEDs
10. fasten new receptacle to the W basement wall
# Cables
1. Pull <span style="color:#00b050">breaker 15</span> (currently connected to all of the garage and a basement laundry receptacle)
2. Disconnect garage lights from existing breaker 15 cable (<span style="color:#00b050">breaker 15</span> will be the new dedicated garage and S wall outdoor receptacle circuit)
3. leave room to stub out a cable for an exterior S. wall receptacle (that receptacle hasn't arrived yet, and placing it will be complicated, so put it off for now).  The stub should be on the newly defined garage receptacle circuit (new <span style="color:#00b050">breaker 15</span>).
4. Disconnect 6-gang laundry receptacle from current breaker 15 (this must be a dedicated GFCI). <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> Consider wiring in the new laundry ckt</mark> at this point, so have a working plugin in the basement.  If so, that new breaker should be a 20 A dual GCFI and AFCI/CAFCI, use existing <span style="color:#2354e7">breaker 13</span>, as it's currently unused.
5. replace breaker in the number 15 slot with 20 A AFCI breaker
6. Fix the dangerous, unprotected Romex running to basement door switch, Lx, either by replacing it with MC, or surrounding it with a wooden box or wiremold.  MC is probably easier but uglier.  But a nice box would match the box that will hide the wires running down the basement stairs beam to switch Sx. (make just cable them both)
7. Run 4/3 MC from garage door switch around the stairway, through a whole drilled in the beam to the entry point for current MC that runs to the upper stair switch.  
8. Remove the prehistoric snarl of burglar alarm and doorbell wire <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">(This might be a good time to figure out how to fix the low voltage doorbell circuit)</mark>
9. Remove old, ungrounded MC.  Everywhere.
10. Run 14/3 MC from stairs post switch in the direction of the shop box, but terminate the MC in a junction box.  In the junction box, connect it to 14/3 ROMEX and run that to the junction box above the shop bench; finish the connection to the bench with 14/3 MC.
11. From stairwell post switch, run 14/2 or 12/2 MC to the same junction box as the shop MC went to.  Continue this connection to te laundry LED light
12. From the stairwell post switch, run 14/2 or 12/2 MC to the junction box in the previous item.  Run one Romex branch to the mid S and SW basement lights.  Run a second branch to the mid N and NW basement lights
13. From the bench junction box, connect the three shop LEDs
14. Figure out how to reroute and hide the speaker wire that's poking out a corner of the stairs.  It's fine, but it looks like lamp cord, and that will make the inspector nervous. We want a calm inspector.
15. From the shop 2 way switch, run 14/2 romex to the 3 shop LEDs
16. Connect
