# Amperage
### Lighting
- separate from receptacles
- all 15 A
### Receptacles
- all 20 A
- simpler, all the same stuff, have to replace outlets anyway
- have to replace all breakers anyway
- no future tripping nuisance
- 12 G romex is not that much more expensive than 14G
### Smoke Detectors
-  [[Wiring Rules#^4339ff|15 A, using my old 14 G wire if I have any]]
# Circuit grouping
- 2 separate 20 A in kitchen,
- Smoke detectors: [[Wiring Rules#^4339ff|dedicated plain 15A breaker on 14 G]]
# Stairs lighting
