- shut off power before doing anything

- Questions to answer before cutting holes and wiring
	- **Can cable be fished under bedroom floor?**
		- If so, can all top floor cable be fished up by the route I used for the kitchen.
	- **Can cable be fished from the S kneewall attic to the top attic for the lights?**  This is where Scout found the knob and tube going to the top attic.
		- If so, this is where the ceiling lights can go
	- **How to fish wire for the hall lights?**
		- circuit elements
			- lower switch
			- lower light
			- upper switch
			- upper light
		- It's a 3 way between upper and lower switches
		- Probable Circuit: 
			- power to lower switch
			- 3-conductor from lower to upper switch
			- upper switch to upper hall ceiling light
		- **Question: how route these wires?**
