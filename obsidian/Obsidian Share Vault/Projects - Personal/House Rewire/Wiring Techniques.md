	- don't use wire nuts (Wagos are better, smaller, easier)
	- mount to flat surface (mounting block) so get good gasket seal.

## Wiring Switches with one cable
From: [Wiring a Switch Loop - Fine Homebuilding](https://www.finehomebuilding.com/project-guides/wiring/wiring-a-switch-loop)

NEC now requires a real neutral in every switch box; the so if the power goes to the light fixture first, you can no longer use a two-wire switch loop; use must use a three-wire cable, and leave an open neutral in the box.
### When power goes to the switch box first

When the power comes into the switch box and only the black wire is switched, then there is a real neutral wire in the switch box, and you can [send a two-conductor cable to the fixture](https://www.buildmyowncabin.com/electrical/wiring-light-switch.html), like so:

![[Wiring Techniques-20240920194011746.webp|420]]
### When power goes to light fixture box first

You used to be able to use 2-wire switch loop, but not anymore.
#### Old School: Use a 2-wire cable (switch loop): <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">not allowd by modern NEC code</span>

When power goes to the light fixture first, most houses that have switches connected to single cables have old school switch loops, made with two conductor cable, where the white wire is colored black in the switch box, and is used as one end of the hot wire wire loop; there is no neutral wire in switch box.  <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">This is no longer allowed.</span>

![[Wiring Techniques-20231230095042769.webp|534]]
#### Modern Method: with neutral required for smart switch
When the power goes to the fixture first, NEC *now* requires that there be a neutral in every new switch box: for smart switches with energy saving or timing features.  Single-cable wiring that is now approved by NEC uses a 3 conductor cable (12-3 or 14-3), and the red and black wires carry power, while the white is left in the outlet and is capped off if not needed.

It looks like this:

# Bathroom GFCI/fan/light
Guy [says](https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/135828/140309) that NEC  Article 210.11 (C)(3) allows you to tap the bathroom 20A GFCI power inputs to power lights/devices in *same bathroom* (2108 post: **old?**). Like this:
![[Wiring Techniques-20231106161314690.webp]]
Be sure to [use matching Gauge](https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/135768/140309) wire to the other stuff, which s/b 12G.
- [ ] Look up that NEC article in the newer book.

# Exterior Lights
Guy [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/gylwyh/comment/ftb8yp6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that NEC allows exterior lights can be direct wired to a switch, don't have to be GFCI (unless they plug in outside).  This guy [says](https://www.fryeelectricinc.com/blog/2016/november/gfci-protection-needed-outdoors/) "all circuits," including lights, but does he mean plugin?
- [ ] look up NEC article

# Outdoor Receptacles
[Many agree](https://www.quora.com/Do-outdoor-outlets-need-to-be-on-their-own-circuit) that they don't have to be on a separate circuit, can be grouped with other receptacles.  Must be GFCI'ed or [AFCI'ed (?)](https://qr.ae/pKCstM), though.  Also, some argue that a separate ckt is still a good idea, to make debugging a tripped breaker easier. [Canada requires at least one dedicated outdoor outlet](https://qr.ae/pKCsnz); the rest don't have to be.  For the engine block heater?
- [ ] verify that interior circuit can go to exterior plugin
- [ ] verify that it doesn't have to be grouped only with receptacles, but other lights too
- [ ] AFCI required outdoor in Seattle?
