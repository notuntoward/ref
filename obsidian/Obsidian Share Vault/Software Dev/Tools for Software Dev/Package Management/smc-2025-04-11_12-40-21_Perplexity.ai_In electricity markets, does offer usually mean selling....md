In electricity markets, does "offer" usually mean selling power and does "bid" mean buying it? Also explain virtual bidding, and how could a virtual bid mean both buying and selling. Include footnoted references with URLs so I can look them up.

## AI answer
In electricity markets, **"offer"** typically refers to selling power (supply), while **"bid"** refers to buying it (demand). Participants submit price-quantity pairs: sellers specify the minimum price they’re willing to accept (offers), and buyers specify the maximum they’re willing to pay (bids) [1](https://www.epexspot.com/en/basicspowermarket) [2](https://flex-power.energy/school-of-flex/pay-as-clear-bid-power-trading/) [8](https://www.iso-ne.com/about/what-we-do/how-resources-are-selected-and-prices-are-set). These are matched in auctions to determine market-clearing prices and volumes.

Virtual Bidding: Financial Positions Without Physical Delivery
--------------------------------------------------------------

Virtual bidding allows market participants to take financial positions in **day-ahead (DA)** markets that are automatically offset in **real-time (RT)** markets. Unlike physical trades, virtual bids involve no actual power generation or consumption. Instead, they arbitrage price differences between DA and RT markets [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_bidding) [10](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/how-power-trading-works) [12](https://capital.com/virtual-bidding-definition).

Types of Virtual Bids
---------------------

1.  **Increment Offers (INCs)**:
    
    *   Act as virtual _sales_ in the DA market.
        
    *   Profitable if RT prices fall below DA prices (sell high, buy low).
        
    *   Example: A trader sells 100 MW virtually at the DA price and later "buys back" at the lower RT price, pocketing the difference [10](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/how-power-trading-works) [11](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/2020/financial-power-markets-trade-types).
        
2.  **Decrement Bids (DECs)**:
    
    *   Act as virtual _purchases_ in the DA market.
        
    *   Profitable if RT prices rise above DA prices (buy low, sell high).
        
    *   Example: A trader buys 100 MW virtually at the DA price and "sells" it at the higher RT price [10](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/how-power-trading-works) [11](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/2020/financial-power-markets-trade-types).
        

How Virtual Bids Enable Both Buying and Selling
-----------------------------------------------

A single virtual bid can represent either buying or selling depending on its type:

*   **DECs** simulate buying in DA and selling in RT.
    
*   **INCs** simulate selling in DA and buying in RT.
    

These positions are purely financial, allowing traders to profit from DA-RT price divergences without physical assets [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_bidding) [12](https://capital.com/virtual-bidding-definition). For instance, a DEC bidder effectively takes a long position (betting on rising prices), while an INC offer takes a short position (betting on falling prices) [10](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/how-power-trading-works) [13](https://www.chesterenergyandpolicy.com/blog/virtual-bids-convergence-bids).

Market Impact and Examples
--------------------------

*   **Price Convergence**: Virtual bids reduce DA-RT price gaps by incentivizing arbitrage [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_bidding) [13](https://www.chesterenergyandpolicy.com/blog/virtual-bids-convergence-bids).
    
*   **Risk Mitigation**: Generators and load-serving entities use virtual bids to hedge against price volatility [9](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/sufg/docs/publications/Juan%20Giraldo%20Dissertation.pdf) [13](https://www.chesterenergyandpolicy.com/blog/virtual-bids-convergence-bids).
    
*   **Liquidity**: Financial participants (e.g., hedge funds) add liquidity, improving market efficiency [6](https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5472&context=ele_comeng_facwork) [12](https://capital.com/virtual-bidding-definition).
    

For example, in the PJM Interconnection market, virtual bidding accounts for ~6% of transactions, helping balance supply and demand forecasts [9](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/sufg/docs/publications/Juan%20Giraldo%20Dissertation.pdf) [13](https://www.chesterenergyandpolicy.com/blog/virtual-bids-convergence-bids).

## User
What is virtual bidding, and in that case, how could a bid mean both buying and selling?

## AI answer
In electricity markets, **virtual bidding** refers to financial transactions where participants buy or sell electricity without the obligation to physically produce or consume it. These trades are settled based on price differences between the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) markets, acting as a form of arbitrage or speculation [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_bidding) [3](https://capital.com/virtual-bidding-definition) [4](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/how-power-trading-works).

How a "Bid" Can Mean Both Buying and Selling
--------------------------------------------

In virtual bidding, the terminology diverges from traditional market conventions:

*   **Incremental Offers (INCs)**: Function as virtual sales in the DA market, where participants agree to sell electricity at DA prices and automatically buy it back in the RT market [4](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/how-power-trading-works) [5](https://www.chesterenergyandpolicy.com/blog/virtual-bids-convergence-bids). This resembles a "sell now, buy later" strategy.
    
*   **Decremental Bids (DECs)**: Function as virtual purchases in the DA market, where participants buy electricity at DA prices and automatically sell it in the RT market [4](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/how-power-trading-works) [5](https://www.chesterenergyandpolicy.com/blog/virtual-bids-convergence-bids). This mirrors a "buy now, sell later" approach.
    

Here, the term "bid" (as in DECs) refers to a financial commitment to _buy_ in the DA market, while "offer" (as in INCs) refers to a commitment to _sell_. However, both positions are reversed in the RT market, effectively allowing a single "bid" to represent a combination of buying and selling across different timeframes [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_bidding) [5](https://www.chesterenergyandpolicy.com/blog/virtual-bids-convergence-bids).

Purpose and Mechanics
---------------------

Virtual bidding aims to:

*   Reduce price disparities between DA and RT markets [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_bidding) [2](https://bitar.engineering.cornell.edu/papers/IFAC17MBP.pdf).
    
*   Improve market efficiency by allowing financial entities (without physical assets) to participate [3](https://capital.com/virtual-bidding-definition) [4](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/how-power-trading-works).
    
*   Hedge risks for physical market participants [5](https://www.chesterenergyandpolicy.com/blog/virtual-bids-convergence-bids).
    

For example, a DEC bid profits if the RT price exceeds the DA price, while an INC offer profits if the DA price is higher [5](https://www.chesterenergyandpolicy.com/blog/virtual-bids-convergence-bids). This duality allows "bids" to encapsulate both buying and selling strategies depending on the market phase [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_bidding) [4](https://blog.yesenergy.com/yeblog/how-power-trading-works).
