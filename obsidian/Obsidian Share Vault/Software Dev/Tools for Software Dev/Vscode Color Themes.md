GitHub, and NetBeans specifically say they're customizable, but perplexity says all VS Code themes are, if you go to json:

```
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
  "[ThemeName]": {
    "sideBar.background": "#347890"
  }
}
```

You can also customize all light or dark themes using wildcard syntax like [*Light*] or [*Dark*].

This seems to be true: [[Vscode code display customization syntax]]
# Good Themes
## sema 
light:
Good, less colorful so maybe not as pretty, but good readability and not jarring.  Background still not as bright as I would like

light chroma:
not sure how diff from "light"
## NetBeans light
good toned down gray comments, bolded function declaration names, docstrings palish orange (tolerable, would prefer to change), non-obnoxious squigglies.  Background a bit dim.
## Visual Studio light
I think what I was using (3/22/25).  This ain't bad, except for the red docstrings, red squigglies are still red. 
## Github
light:
sharp, easy to read, but slightly dim background.  Is I could style it to get rid of the red keywords

light default:
not sure what the difference is
# Meh Themes
## Blue light
NOt bad but lavender keywords, still a bit gray and hardish to read

- blucco ligtht italic or not
slighlty grayish background, I like the dimmed and (optionally) italic comments.  Yellow docstrings a bit pale, but OK.  Gray screen, though.
## Blue light 2022
a little more red color.  Not terrible but ordinary "blue light" is better
## calm days:
day:
not offensive, has gray background and powder colors, a bit hard to read.

day sky:
more readable than day, but still gray background

dark themes:
tend to have bright colors, don't like
# Nope Themes
## Material 
lighter:
way too pale, powder text. Nope.

high contrast:
same prob, not relly high contrast. Nope.
## Quiet Light
lots of pale lavender and pale green, on outside interface, too. Not awful, but nope.  Vcode theme, though, so can't uninstall
## Visual Studio high contrast
Good white background but underlined, obnoxious squigglies (sometimes blue, at least.  Red keywords.  Nope
## Light modern
lavender keywords, dull red strings.  Nope.
## light+
Nope
## sema 
(but other sema themes are good)

same as light but dim gray bacground.  Nope.

soft choma:
Nope, still dim gray background
## Slack
I remember not liking these from before, and I still don't
## Solarized
I remember not liking these from before, and I still don't. Are they all vscode?

too much red. Nope

very white background, docstrings look same as code, squigglies are super obnoxious. Nope
