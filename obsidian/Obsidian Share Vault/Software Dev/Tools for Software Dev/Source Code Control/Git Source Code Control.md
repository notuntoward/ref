## Splitting refwrangle off of ref
Obsidian note updates in an code repo was unmanageable, so I created refwrangle as a new repo.

- [x] remove old refwrangle from ref
- [ ] ! Rename new refwrangle master branch to main.  
	- I accidentally created it as master while bitbucket's top page is main.  main also has a README.md
# Submodules in Git
## Obsidian Git Submodule
Obsidian's [[2024-07-30#Git Plugin]] has a way to use submodules, so I was thinking I could put the `refwrangle` code in one of those, under `ref`.  But I decided to instead keep it simple, and to make a new `refwrangle` repo.
