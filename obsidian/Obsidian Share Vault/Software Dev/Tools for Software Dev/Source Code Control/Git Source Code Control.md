## Splitting refwrangle off of ref
Obsidian note updates in an code repo was unmanageable, so I created refwrangle as a new repo.

- [x] remove old refwrangle from ref
- [ ] ! Rename new refwrangle master branch to main.  
	- I accidentally created it as master while bitbucket's top page is main.  main also has a README.md
