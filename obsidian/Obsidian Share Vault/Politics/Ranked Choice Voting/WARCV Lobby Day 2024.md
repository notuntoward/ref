## One objection to the bill and the response

From Tim White, on the 1/29/25 FairVote WA Lobby day call

> Hearing criticism from OSOS Stuart Holmes (?)claimed RCV auditing not possible because cast vote records are exempt from disclosure.  
> This was taken as fact by others who repeated it.  
> The claim is false.  
> Here's the law:  
> RCW 42.56.425 Election security. ...  
> (e) Voted ballots, voted ballot images, copies of voted ballots, photographs of voted ballots, facsimile images of voted ballots, or cast vote records of voted ballots, starting at the time of ballot return from the voter, during storage per RCW 29A.60.110, and through destruction following any retention period or litigation. ...  
> (3) The exemptions specified in subsection (1) of this section do not prohibit an audit authorized or required under Title 29A RCW from being conducted.

(Stuart Homes is Sec. State Assistant for elections, ran for State Auditor a couple elections ago.  TW says he knew he was lying)

From Luke Walton
> You'll be looking at Section 15 for this workgroup of experts

Also (Eric Bildstrup)
> I recall also hearing about Risk Limiting Audits for RCV are also available

TW says
> Eric is correct. RLAs are designed and ready for auditing RCV in all its various versions.
