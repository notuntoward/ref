# TODO
- graph showing all the information loss sources from a good D policy to a voter's decision about it, rational or not.
- same graph of info loss from polls to D policy and messaging decision
- graph showing all sources of polling error
- examples of compounding policy errors
- ranking of factors affecting a vote e.g. of fear (I did a perplexity on this but it's not saved in zotero)
	- note: [fear can turn liberals into conservatives and safety can turn conservatives into liberals](https://share.evernote.com/note/4fa1a1d3-c603-48fb-b04d-d33eec4d0370)
- dig into economic literature on irrational consumer behavior
- dig into the list of cognitive errors (both voters, R's and D's make them)
# Why did the Democrats fail?
## Harris Demographic, Geographic underperformance
- [[Votes Harris Lost Compared to Margin of Trump Win]]
- Geographic voting patterns: [[Woodland24electAmericanNations|Woodland24: The 2024 Presidential Election and the American Nations]] 
## Factors Contributing to Harris Loss
### Biden
What I think: One of the biggest.  He should have not run, should have dropped out sooner, and should have showcased here during his 1st term.
- [[Tapper25bidenHandedTrumpPres|Tapper25: How Joe Biden Handed the Presidency to Donald Trump]]: the too-old denial
- Many thought Biden shouldn't run and with ample reasons: [[Lozada25bidenScapegoat|Lozada25: Biden Is a Scapegoat. The Democrats Are the Problem.]] 
### Harris
Was she a crappy candidate?  A little, I think.
- Her aids tried to improver her social skills with a practice dinner part: [[Lozada25bidenScapegoat|Lozada25: Biden Is a Scapegoat. The Democrats Are the Problem.]] 
### Crime, disorder, homelessness
I think this was fairly big.  Ds earned a rep for incompetent.

- Tolerance of crime and disorder pissed off people, D's lost much in "diverse cities"  [[Barro25demsNeedToCleanHouse|Barro25demsNeedToCleanHouse]] 
- BLM protests
	- [[Bump25protestsNotHelpTrump|Stating the obvious: Mass protests are not going to help Trump]]
### AI
What I think: AFIK, this wasn't too important.  But the Tech Oligarch funders of Trump campaign esp. [[#Musk as traitor to America]] are getting what they paid for ([[Brody25techAccountBigBeautBill|Brody25techAccountBigBeautBill]] )
#### Examples of AI in politics

### The Chinese
### The Russians
- KGB 85% of budget on overt destruction of US society: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]] 
### The Jews
- ? were they miffed in a way similar to Asians?   [[Barro25demsNeedToCleanHouse|Barro25demsNeedToCleanHouse]] 
### The Gays
### Lying Republicans
- in Dawson23cognitiveAbilityVotingEU the UK higher cog. voters were more likely to vote remain during Brexit. Authors speculate that lower cog. voters are vulnerable to misinformation
- Trump was great at it: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]] 
- People like Bannon are probably happy with their transparently dumb arguments: [[Sartre44antisemiteJew|Sartre44: Anti-semite and jew]] 
### The Great Trump
Trump is really the best president ever.
### People forgot how bad Trump was
- Medina24amnesiaAboutTrump
### COVID
- COVID + post-COVID inflation wiped out incumbents everywhere: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]] 
### Ukraine
### Groupthink
- [[Lozada25bidenScapegoat|Lozada25: Biden Is a Scapegoat. The Democrats Are the Problem.]] 
### Political Correctness
- the word wokeness as toxic as "socialism" for general electorate: Yokley23wokeVoterPerception
- wokeness exposes elite lack of priority on lower class issues (Gorman says): Bedford21GOPFindsSuccess
- leftist proposals most closely associated with wokeness aren’t widely popular: Bedford21GOPFindsSuccess
	- 18% of people in the United States support defunding the police (USA today poll)
	- 56% of them, opposed sports teams or leagues using their public platform to advocate for social or political change. 
	- Fifty-eight percent of all voters said they opposed corporations using their platforms to advocate for social causes.
	- Carville flagged wokeness as a D problem
	- A pretty good quote from Sen. Tim Scott:
	  
	   “It’s backwards to fight discrimination with different discrimination. And it’s wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present.”
	   
	   and
	   
	   "It is a progressive conception of diversity that does not include diversity of thought. It is discrimination falsely marketed as inclusion,”
- D's shaming Rs with different opinions
	- Lewis24demsGenderID
- WA state low income 0-interest loans
	- [[FAIR24fairVsWalkerLoanDiscrim|FAIR24: FAIR v. Walker]] 
	- excludes Japanese, Jews and whites
	- ? Does WA may have more poor whites than any other group? If so, this is politically stupid. In any case, seems nasty, if the idea is to address poverty.

- Only 27% think BLM worked in 2025, and BLM support dropped in just a couple (?) months after Floyd  [[Horowitz25policeBLM5yearsFloyd|Horowitz25: Views of Race, Policing and Black Lives Matter in the 5 Years Since George Floyd’s Killing]] 
#### Seattle Handsoff Protest
I couldn't hear much, but I think the first speaker started talking about Native American being victims of white colonization.  Given the market tank, all the worries on the protestors poster, this was a total non-sequiter, and nobody near was cheering for it, but there were dutiful liberals scattered clapping and cheering: taking their medicine, probably worried about not clapping.
- [ ] get the transcripts of the speakers, who were Pramila Jayapal, Justin Gill, Hamdi Mohamed
	- organizations involved e.g., Seattle Indivisible, Planned Parenthood, Evergreen Resistance
	- [according to Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/where-can-i-find-a-recording-o-Q4lmSsJyTUq.JFAL5xdufw#0)
### Democrats were bad communicators
- language and stuff
- Harris & D's didn't say much: [[Longwell25demsChenyDemoc|Longwell25: Did Democrats Have a Liz Cheney Problem? (with Jen Psaki)]] 
### The Economy
#### Economy really was bad
- [[Ludwig25votersCorrectEcon|Ludwig25: Voters Were Right About the Economy. The Data Was Wrong.]]
- [[MorningConsult25priceSurpriseIdx|MorningConsult25: price surprise index]] 
- bad economy and interactions: [[Politics/Political Causality/US Elections 2024.md#Issue/Message Interaction Examples |Issue/Message Interaction Examples]]

- Inflation and Biden's age were what voters tracked: - [[Lozada25bidenScapegoat|Lozada25: Biden Is a Scapegoat. The Democrats Are the Problem.]] 
#### Weak economy doomed D's
- many posts say so
- but some say it was actually a perceived strong economy doomed the D's, rather than a weak real/perceived econ (Pastor24greatBidenEconHelpedTrump)
- COVID + post-COVID inflation wiped out incumbents everywhere: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]] 
#### Postmaterialism: when a bad economy matters less
Both R's and D's vote less on economic issues and more on values: 
- [[Lowrey24RiseUnionRight|Lowrey24: The Rise of the Union Right]] 
- or social insecurity: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]] 
### Immigration
- 2X more voters prioritized immigration than abortion: [[Ponnuru25learnDemsDKborder|Ponnuru25: What Democrats can learn from Denmark’s left-leaning border hawks]] 
- D's heavily lost Hispanics on the US-Mexico border: [[Barro25demsNeedToCleanHouse|Barro25demsNeedToCleanHouse]] 
- I kind of loss of control of borders, increasing insecurity which in general, helped Trump: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]] 
- Mass immigrant deportation more popular than Trump himself: [[Kessler25noiseTrumpChaosPoll|Kessler25noiseTrumpChaosPoll]] 
- Immigrants went R: [[Nowrasteh25natImmigVotedRep|Nowrasteh25: Naturalized Immigrants Probably Voted Republican in 2024]]

- 100 day polls: deporting illegal aliens still gets small majority support [[Balz25trumpApprovSink]]
### US Culture
### Random Bad Luck
### Anti-Incumbency Cycle
- COVID + post-COVID inflation wiped out incumbents everywhere: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]]
### Racism / Sexism
- Declare R racism b/c 100 days: MAGA still loves Trump on immigration? [[Salvanto25trump100dayPollTariff]]
### Trump is what the People Wanted
- yes, they wanted to feel in control and better about themselves: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]] 
	- [ ] @ find empirical evidence for or against this idea
	- yes, e.g. mass immigrant deportation more popular than Trump himself: [[Kessler25noiseTrumpChaosPoll|Kessler25noiseTrumpChaosPoll]] 
- 100 days: R's happy with Trump policy, think he did what he promised [[Salvanto25trump100dayPollTariff]]
### Global Trend
- COVID + post-COVID inflation wiped out incumbents everywhere: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]] 
- global inflationary pressure: [[JoeBlogs25usSupplyChainMeltDown|JoeBlogs25: USA Supply Chain Meltdown]] 
### Loss of trust in experts, institutions
- people don't believe experts, media, etc. Go to friends
	- I have more than one article on this, I think
	- odd example: [[Verma24muskPoliticsEcoCar|Verma24: Musk’s politics hadn’t seeped into Tesla. Then he axed its eco car of the future.]]
- Musk trades in this: [[Isaac25internetCringeMusk|Isaac25: Elon Musk’s Internet: So Based, Much Wow. So Cringe?]] 
- Brazilians didn't trust democracy, but eventually removed an authoritarian: [[Ivanova22systemicMistrustBrazil|Ivanova22: Brazil's Systemic Mistrust of Elections and Democracy]] 
- I'm guessing modern KGBs helped this: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]] 
- Conspiracy belief (probably) doesn't change attitude towards democracy: [[Dolan25authoritPrimeCnsprcy|Dolan25: Authoritarian minds may be primed for conspiracy beliefs, study suggests]] 
- Voters trust Trump and Media *equally*! (37%): [[MorningConsult25trustTrumpVsMedia|MorningConsult25: Americans trust Trump as much]] 
- Fibbing about Biden's brain hurt trust in Ds: [[Lozada25bidenScapegoat|Lozada25: Biden Is a Scapegoat. The Democrats Are the Problem.]] 
## Lack of D party enthusiasm/turnout
- was the D loss due to poor Democratic turnout or to Ds switching to R?
- 100 day polls e.g. [[Balz25trumpApprovSink]]: D's still not popular, and Ds not satisfied Ds, unlike Rs who *are* satisfied with Trump
- Blacks not optimistic about progress?  [[Horowitz25policeBLM5yearsFloyd|Horowitz25: Views of Race, Policing and Black Lives Matter in the 5 Years Since George Floyd’s Killing]] 
- They didn't pick Harris: [[Lozada25bidenScapegoat|Lozada25: Biden Is a Scapegoat. The Democrats Are the Problem.]] 
## Abortion overemphasized, not important
- abortion a concern of young women, not old?
- more concern about economy
- do the graph votes associated with ranking combinations of issues
## Overreliance on demographic groups
### Demographic Info Sources
- PBS24keyVoteGroupsInteract : interesting but can't search since must operate interactively
### Student loans & youth vote
- voters who have student load debt
	- 780k people have (Habeshian24trumpStudentDebtWA)
	- 140 M total 2024 voters: PBS24keyVoteGroupsInteract (not final yet)
#### Student loans as political liability?
Young people e.g. student loans was a liability (Trump tried to enrage the larger working class) for small amount of student voters. Also an example of issue interaction: (maybe made upper class students happy, working class mad) ^i6p3
- young people were 14% of 2024 voters (CIRCLE24youthVote2024), 38% of them had no college experience
	- so the affected young people vote was 14% * 62% = 8.68% of voters
- ~ 42% of eligible voters aged 18-29 cast ballots in the 2024 presidential election, lower than in 2020 (17%) and 2016 (19%) (CIRCLE24youthVote2024)
- Young voters favored Kamala Harris over Donald Trump by 6 percentage points (52% to 46%) (CIRCLE24youthVote2024, I think)
- smaller margin Biden't 2020 25% in 2020 (CIRCLE24youthVote2024, I think)
- Young voters w/o college education went for Trump by 10%;  with some college for Harris by 12%, college grads 14 % (Arrojas24collegeAgeVote, I think) 
- college-experienced voters cast about 62% of the 2024 vote
	- 40% of the voting-eligible youth population are young people without college experience (CIRCLE24youthVote2024)
	- 38% of all youth votes were cast by young people without college experience (CIRCLE24youthVote2024)

## Attacks
- [[Politics/Political Causality/US Elections 2024.md#Polarization Enhancement Your fellow R is evil (algorithmic)|Polarization Enhancement: Your fellow R is evil (algorithmic) ^q98mss]]
### Tariffs: he and the Rs are not on your side
- Tariffs are aimed at YOU
	- the lies: these are reciprocal, fighting back against other countries's unfair tariffs
	- the true: equations asked, how much do we have to raise taxes on consumers to force them to stop buying
	- and ven these equations were botched, due to Trump & Co's incompetence
- R politicians knew this was BS, but were afraid of Trump, wanted to bigger careers, and went along, even praised Trump!
- 100 days: R's happy with Trump tariffs & immigration [[Salvanto25trump100dayPollTariff]]
### Republican Deficit Hypocrisy

	- see [[Schasfoort25tariffChaosSense|Schasfoort25: Why Trump's tariff chaos actually makes sense (big picture)]] 
#### Musk as traitor to America
- Musk donated $100M to Trumps 2024 election, but he’s very vulnerable to China’s gov’t actions, making him a vehicle to manipulate Trump, in order to forward his own interests, maybe at the cost to American workers and national security (Bradsher24muskNeedChina)
- Musk unfairness
	- how much money he as vs. average American: Is he really worth 1.6M X the average American?
	- his interests aren't your interests
	- He employs XX Americans; other industries employ YY
	- He adds XX to American economy; other industries add YY
- Musk danger
	- his interests and vulnerability to China make his influence questionable, esp. Chinese network-connected cars, if Trump cuts Biden's tariff
	- look what he did to Twitter
- Message evolution
	- attack Musk as being born rich, get resentful MAGA heads nodding, then emphasize that Trump was born rich too
- [[Verma24muskPoliticsEcoCar|Verma24: Musk’s politics hadn’t seeped into Tesla. Then he axed its eco car of the future.]] 
- A Musk attack, since he wants all AI?[[Palmer23llmsArgueConvincing|Palmer23: Large Language Models Can Argue in Convincing Ways About Politics, But Humans Dislike AI Authors: implications for Governance]] 
- Musk is very unpopular, and he's barely started: [[Balz25trumpEarlyActionUnpop|Balz25: Many of Trump’s early actions are unpopular, Post-Ipsos poll finds]] 
- He may also be becoming uncool to his fans: 
	- Musk trades in this: [[Isaac25internetCringeMusk|Isaac25: Elon Musk’s Internet: So Based, Much Wow. So Cringe?]]

- Tesla sales down a bit in UW and WA: [[Buhain25waOutOfTeslaLove|Buhain25: Is Washington state falling out of love with Tesla?]] 
- Trump's White House promotion of Tesla is a good "he's not for you" attack
	- tons of video of Trump saying EVs are bad, maybe even EV people are bad
	- he's actually for Elon Musk, the richest guy in the world
	- [ ] ? I'm sure this has been thought of, but how to reach the right audience and would it work?  Do a search on this

# Questions
## How to get and keep attention
- the two axes of clickbait and A/B B testing: [[Muller21ClickbaitUnreasEffect|Muller21: Clickbait is Unreasonably Effective]] 
## Making Important Issues Salient and relevant
### Definitions: Salient, Relevant, Important
From here:
- **Salient** is about what you notice first.
- **Relevant** is about what connects to the topic.
- **Important** is about what matters most.
### Issue Measurements: Salience, Relevance, Importance
- "Important" is hard to measure, not objective?
- Measurement of Issue Salience and Relevance
	- population-level measures (a kind of poll)
		- "Have you heard about it" poll:  [[MorningConsult25negEconNewsBreakThru|MorningConsult25: Negative economic news is increasingly breaking through with Americans]] 
- Biden didn't get that inflation and his age were his most important numbers: [[Lozada25bidenScapegoat|Lozada25: Biden Is a Scapegoat. The Democrats Are the Problem.]] 
- [[#Salient hypocrisy tracker]]
###### Trump Voter Satisfaction (post-2024 election)
- [[Longwell25areTrumpVotersGetAsk|Longwell25: Are These Trump Voters Getting What They Voted For? (with Mark Leibovich)]]
	- answer: Yes: 100 days: R's happy with Trump policy, think he did what he promised [[Salvanto25trump100dayPollTariff1]]
- [[Politics/Political Causality/US Elections 2024.md#Trump 100 Day Polls: Term 2 |Trump 100 Day Polls: Term 2]]: Rs are satisfied, especially MAGA Rs, but not the rest of the public ^d9y3
## How voters weight different policies in their voting decision (sensitivity analysis)
- Econ most imp by far: [[Klein25demsFaceTrumpWon|Klein25: Democrats Need to Face Why Trump Won]] 
- 100 days: Econ and Immig most important: [[Salvanto25trump100dayPollTariff|Salvanto25trump100: Trump's first 100 days seen as bringing big changes, but still too much focus on tariffs  — CBS News poll]] 
- [[#Issue Measurements Salience, Relevance, Importance]]
## Media effectiveness
- e.g. Yurieff24trumpUsedInfluencers : did this really work as claimed here?
- ? how do advertisers measure or (get proxies of) effectiveness of media message --> purchase
- [[Bump25protestsNotHelpTrump|Stating the obvious: Mass protests are not going to help Trump]]: R media framing turns R/L violence comparison upside down.
## How to communicate comparative government performance
- US low taxes, high GDP, a better COVID recovery and lower inflation that peers
- ? Displaying an inflation "weather map?"
	- would this have helped?
	- across countries
	- also time graphs
	- ? but would have to consider that low income people were hit harder than high income people
		-  put that in the map?
- same thing with gun deaths
- health insurance costs
- etc.
## Convincing the need for short-term sacrifice
- R's say 100 days not long enough to judge Trump's tariffs, by is this a mirage? [[Salvanto25trump100dayPollTariff]]
## New Proxies
Just more predictor variables for various things. Things similar to education, which predicts poll response, vote likelihood, party lean. What other information is there that is gettable?  Could this be a long list of things, with missing feature imputation when not available?

- turnout proxies
- poll response proxies
- party vote lean proxy
- Pederson volatility (Pedersen79dynamPartyVolatileEU), used e.g. in (Qvortrup24neurosciVoteEmotion and many others)
## What factors make a person accept facts from somebody he dislikes
- i.e. how to persuade through rural anti-intellectualism
## Do words in polls mean what you think they mean?
- e.g. questions like is the country going in the "wrong" direction?'
	- "wrong" means very different things to different people
	- example from [[Longwell25demsChenyDemoc|Longwell25: Did Democrats Have a Liz Cheney Problem? (with Jen Psaki)]] :
		- D's apparently made democracy a talking point, put Cheney on, etc. because polls seemed to say that "democracy" was salient
		- But R's didn't want to hear D democracy talking points b/c the Ds who "stole" the election.
	- **Indea**: after an election, ask poll issue questions is a bunch of ways
		- train a model to predictive model of the vote
		- jointly tune an LLM that learns to ask the most predictive questions for each issue
		- somehow, how do model how the candidates stood on the issue, though...
# Destructing Conspiracy Theories
- facts don't seem to work, can reinforce existing opinion (references..)
- conspiracy theory attractions
	- makes your life simple ==> make your conspiracy make your life complicated
	- convinces you that you are good ==> make it make you look bad (a common tactic, I think)
	- AI works

- Musk's internet language and imagery looks "authentic" to online gamers : [[Isaac25internetCringeMusk|Isaac25: Elon Musk’s Internet: So Based, Much Wow. So Cringe?]]

# Predictive Models and Analysis Techniques
- market sentiment indexes predicted by economic variables (Weber24implicitCoordInflateShock).  Could be *voter* sentiment predicted by other variables
	- more on econ features: [[MorningConsult25priceSurpriseIdx|MorningConsult25priceSurpriseIdx]] 
- economic features
	- inflationary pressure: [[JoeBlogs25usSupplyChainMeltDown|JoeBlogs25: USA Supply Chain Meltdown]] 
	- ? are economists good about predicting inflation well in advance?
		- if so, then no need to look at fundamental econ features, just use economist predictions.
- bulk features built from the poll difference between a presidential candidate and same-party state/county/city candidates. Or, look at post-election results for election autopsies
- during election autopsies analyzing across elections in different years, try to factor out the effect of each (modellable) variable so you can see which thing by itself — inflation, war, … — caused the big changes.  
	- See example of doing this in words in [Ezra Klein Speaks Frankly Abou...](https://youtu.be/vkXJiEzWxFs?t=1484)..
	- His wife's article is cited. Did she use numbers?
- Predicting district lean: [[Jain25moderatesOverperform|Jain25: The real overperformers of the 2024 election might rankle you]]
- time-lagged causality elimination technique: [[Dolan25authoritPrimeCnsprcy|Dolan25: Authoritarian minds may be primed for conspiracy beliefs, study suggests]] 
## 100 Day Polls
About polls 100 days into a term.  Factors out the fact that most presidents lose popularity over time, difference between day 1 and day 100 could be a kind of detrended features, kind of like % gain of different stocks over time.  I saw a graph like that for Trump vs. other presidents, but I'm not sure I have it.

# Questions / Hypotheses to test
- [ ] @ Take a look at all the paper's at this guy's lab:  Kolbert25oneEmotionEthics
- [ ] [[#Do words in polls mean what you think they mean?]]
## Education realignment around D's
- [Klein says](https://youtu.be/vkXJiEzWxFs?t=1511) it's happening globally, that there is theorizing about why
- My theories
	- [ ] ? Could it be the smarter people who can understand more complex arguments of the kind that the D's make? Dawson23cognitiveAbilityVotingEU says cognitive limitations affected political choice but I haven't read it yet. Does this interact with other cognitive loads, say stress from losing a job or higher prices?
		- [ ] do low IQ people need more shortcuts? Rubin24demsLowInfoVoterShortcut or is it just busy, low information voters?
- [ ] Are "low information voters" often really high information voters who know a lot about conspiracy theories (JV Last kind of says this in TheBulwark24isAmericaSerious) i.e. are many just crazy? How distinguish? Campaign-wise, is it worth distinguishing them?

- Disaster of not doing so: [[Lozada25bidenScapegoat|Lozada25: Biden Is a Scapegoat. The Democrats Are the Problem.]] 
## How specifically does Trump sound like an honest, real person?
- non-politically correct, says what they're thinking but others are afraid to say it?
- just says what they already think? He's not persuading but got in front of their parade?
- is inarticulate, as in most conversations?
- [[Frankfurt86onBullshitEssay|Frankfurt86: On bullshit]] 
## How communicate policy to voters who know nothing?
- Voters know shockingly little and this was who Harris needed to convince: Rubin24demsLowInfoVoterShortcut
- [ ] # ID features that are salient to low info voters just before election, when they pay a little attention: Rubin24demsLowInfoVoterShortcut
	- [[#Issue Measurements Salience, Relevance, Importance]]
## Are there ideological fractures in Trump coalition that could be exploited by D's?
- or are new Rs "tolerant" and so they won't have ideological fights?
- one guy's take: Walther24barstoolConservatism
- I keep hoping Christian conservatives will have a falling out with the libertarians, right wing business people, the white supremacists, and the Nazi types.
## Was 2024 not a revolt against D politicians but against D voters?
- D politicians didn't talk much about the Left, but D voters still did (Wells24electionMythsLessons)
	- If true, then D politician messaging won't help, unless it's a Bill Clintonesque Sister Souljah moment?
	- ? how true are these points?
- related:Lewis24demsGenderID 
- [[Young23wrongAppetiteMisinfo|Young23wrongAppetiteMisinfo]] : now there's *affective* polarization
## Auto-detection of political messaging/conversation themes and their importance
- Sentiment analysis was used to shape messages, etc. in 2024. maybe earlier
- how are representative of general population
- how important to the people who are talking about it
- Proposes AI polling/policy making: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]] 
- [[Frankfurt86onBullshitEssay|Frankfurt86: On bullshit]] 
## Auto-detection of misinformation and disinformation
- [[Frankfurt86onBullshitEssay|Frankfurt86: On bullshit]] 
## Issue half-life
- given a set of issues, predict how "important", "salient" they will be in the future
- a factor useful to know if an issue will be important by the time of the election
## Persuadable Voter Prediction
A lot of polling is important only as a clue to how you can actually change the vote.  So this is predicting that a voter is not on your side but has some probability of being persuaded in your direction.  Training data would be past elections where this voter is known to have been (in my case) leaning R and eventually voted D (or said her or she would).  I bet David Shor's company does have this kind of data.
## Polling by sentiment analysis
- first, do [[#Auto-detection of political messaging/conversation themes and their importance|Auto-detection of political messaging/conversation themes and their importance]]
- then, [[#Issue half-life|Issue half-life]]
- then estimate representativeness of total voting population (like polling respondent weighting)
- also [[Gen AI Talk Ideas#Sentiment Analysis|Sentiment Analysis]]
- Proposes AI polling/policy making: [[Razzaque25trumperBelievePsych|Razzaque25: Why TRUMP Supporters Really Believe]] 
## Polling for agreement
Bipartisan issues that can make your candidate look good if strongly pushed
- [[#Agreement Issues]]
## Detect when people are so tired of a message that they ignore it
- so know when to switch adverts
- to settle arguments about whether somebody's interest (mens rights, womens rights, global warming) has been beaten for the death for the moment
## Issue/Message interaction tester
- an issue/message that most voters might find uninteresting e.g. wokeism (see studies I found stating this) might be potent which combined with some other issue/message
### Why interactions can matter
- Trump polls badly on every issue except gender identity, yet the *public thinks he is more in touch* with regular people's concerns than Trump is
	- e.g [[#100 Day Polls]]
	- e.g [100 day polls](<Politics/Political Causality/US Elections 2024.md#^d9y3 >)
		- Trump underwater on all issues tested *except gender ID* ([[Agiesta25trump100dayWorst7decades]]), while another 100 day poll found Trump underwater on everything except immigration, yet voters thought the Dem Party was a little more out of touch than Trump, and trust *him* more than congressional Ds! ([[Balz25trumpApprovSink]])
		- Is this a little like people trusting people more who look like them?
	- gender id: 
		- Lewis24demsGenderID : D's can't explain
		- Peters25policySupportMoreThanTrump :  majority is OK with limit how doctors can treat children struggling w/ gender ID
		- Edsall25deepWoundDems : transgender was in top 3 Trump campaign talking points (I see polls told him where the public stood)
### Issue/Message Interaction Examples
- actual 2024 election examples
	- wokeism and working class economic worries
		- Glueck24endWhiteWorkingDems, Yudkin24perceptGapIDpolit, Chait24ModerateNotSurrender
		- Top reason why "swing voters" (decision was up in the air somehow, see definition) went to Trump was D's too focused on cultural issues, more imp. than inflation: Cass24WhyChoseTrump as well as Bennett23wokeUseAsDistraction
	- Liberal Asians going Right b/c of crime
		- Seattle: CID (Chinatown) b/c of crime: Cabahug24seattleCIDshiftTrump
		- San Francisco: Kang24youngMaleVoters
			- believed Dems "equity-driven school policies" was not a good reaction to hate Crimes, Dems seen as looking after their interests
			- they fled from SPS too:  [[Westneat25disaprTopStudentsSPS|Westneat25: Seattle was told it was ‘disappearing’ its top students]] 
	- [[#Student loads as political liability?|Student loads as political liability?]] 
	- Roaring stockmarket as liability: Weber24implicitCoordInflateShock
	- suburban R never trumper emphasis vs. working class economic worries:
		- [[Glueck24endWhiteWorkingDems|Glueck24: Is This the End of the White Working-Class Democrat?]] 
		- wokeism vs. school worries during COVID: 
			- [[Goldstein24SchoolBattlesMay|Goldstein24: School Battles May Help Explain Why Democrats Declined in Some Suburbs]] 
			- [[Editorial23cheerMediocWAschools|Editorial23: Cheerleading mediocrity is not good enough for WA's education department]] 
			- Seattle schools too
				- for some reason: [[Superville25leftSeattleSchls|Superville25: Why have thousands left Seattle schools? A new survey suggests answers]] 
				- advanced math cancellation (actually, before COVID, too): [[Westneat25disaprTopStudentsSPS|Westneat25: Seattle was told it was ‘disappearing’ its top students. Did SPS hear?]] 
	- anti-Israel vs. concern for order, econ: The very least popular reason for voting for Trump was Harris was too pro-Israel (Cass24WhyAmericaChose) but the R's made hay of campus riots 
		- [ ] ? but didn't the D's also lose MI arab votes b/c of Israel?
	- trans: [[Dionne24hiddenVictoryProgrssiv|Dionne24: The lessons in progressives’ hidden 2024 victories]]
- speculative examples
	- Abortion backfire theory?: TheBulwark24bulwarkHelpTrump
		- State initiatives might have been a turnout tool for pro-abortion/anti-immigration Trump voters
		- [ ] ? check with studies done months after the election if this is true
	- [ ] ? COVID restrictions vs. working class economic worries: a guess, I don't have a source
	- [ ] ? Were young feminists Grose24youngWimynWillTalkSexistm in an unfortunate interaction?
	- if trans+economy was bad for Harris, how about Mike Johnson's new trans bathroom ban (Solender24transBathroomBanMikeJohnson). Doesn't he have more important things to do that the working class expects to get done?
	- R abandonment of Gay Marriage and Abortion was OK b/c immigration was a strong issue for anti-GM, anti-Ab people. They were also distracted by the R's anti-trans antidote. Dionne24hiddenVictoryProgrssiv
- idea: do a message testing survey of the type in Blueprint24pollPosHarrisCase where conjoint analysis is done with Trump attacks and Harris rebuttals. 
	- But idea here is to pair *same-candidate* issues/messages and measure effects.
	- This could get combinatorial fast: could the test be approximated by:
		1. making compressed LLM-style tokens of messages and issues
		2. randomly sample a multivariate message/issue token space
		3. for each realization, generate a test paragraph that contains this exact combination of message/issue
		4. actually test these synthetic messages during polling
	- Like doing [[Hyperparameter Tuning]] but modern instead of grid
		- Blueprint24pollPosHarrisCase is like a grid search
		- Instead do randomized or something fancier like [[Zygmunt17fastHyperband|Zygmunt17fastHyperband|Hyperband]] 
		- Could tailor to compute (survey time) budget:[[Eggensperger22hyperparamOptHPOBench]] 
		- the optimal survey could be found iteratively
			- with the message adjusted to the by the tuning algorithm on each test
			- a poor man's reinforcement learning
	- somehow would have to get rid of the poll-responder underestimate effect
		- maybe try to adust them with paid benchmark surveys e.g. [[Lau23compareProbPanelsPoll]],  discussed in [[Cohn24changePollsAvoid2020]] 
	- use [[#Detect when people are so tired of a message that they ignore it|Detect when people are so tired of a message that they ignore it]] so know for sure when switch to new message

	- [[Politics/Political Causality/US Elections 2024.md#Issue Measurements Salience, Relevance, Importance|Measurement: Salient, Relevant, Important]]
- Current/forecasted economy, electoral consequence forecast
	- Economic buying power of different socio-econ groups
		- realtime cost of living indicator
		- somehow put that in context with different levels of class income (which will change too)
		- different in different areas: rural vs. suburbs vs. city vs. bad neighborhoods
		- [[MorningConsult25priceSurpriseIdx|MorningConsult25: price surprise index]] 
	- Estimate of marginal effect on each class, and on regions
		- [ ] consider: Grose24youngWimynWillTalkSexistm, won't acknowledge young feminist saturation, yet this was only 9% of population (according to her article's comments, but I can check this)
	- Estimate of marginal effect on candidate/party/incumbent popularity, turnout, vote consequence
	- besides raw econ numbers, consider how this is perceived e.g. the "country's good/bad direction," etc. Like in McMann24mornCnsltRateDefMeth
- something about campaign timing: I think I zotero'ed something about timing, but I can't find it at the moment
- something about party unity, since that seems to matter
- a candidate's purity rating
	- how out of step he/she is with the electorate
	- how possible would it be to backtrack during the general?
	- forecast of ultimate electorate effect

### Salient hypocrisy tracker
Gaps in public perception of where Trump is spending his time vs. what people think he should prioritize,
e.g. [[MorningConsult25trumpPrioMismatch|MorningConsult25: Imposing tariffs is the biggest mismatch]].  Also fuse with issue importance, media coverage, etc., for finding promising attack vectors, and demographic factors indicating if the gaps occur in the population of voters that need persuading.
