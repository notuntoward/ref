# Describe the current state of Seattle's Burke Gilman missing link bike trail, and explain how it reached its current state.

---
The "Missing Link" of Seattle's Burke-Gilman Trail remains incomplete as of February 2025. This 1.4-mile section in Ballard, connecting the existing trail segments, has been delayed for over three decades due to ongoing legal battles, community opposition, and logistical challenges. Despite being a priority in Seattle's Bicycle Master Plan since the 1990s, the Missing Link has faced resistance from local businesses along the proposed route and extensive litigation under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), which opponents have used to delay progress[^1][^4][^9].

### Current State

- **Unfinished Section**: The Missing Link spans 1.4 miles around Salmon Bay, east of the Ballard Locks. Cyclists must navigate busy streets or alternative routes to bypass this gap[^1][^9].
- **Proposed Alternatives**: In response to persistent opposition, Seattle's Department of Transportation (SDOT) is exploring a new alignment along NW Market Street, Leary Avenue NW, and 17th Avenue NW to connect the trail segments. This alternative seeks to minimize conflict with local businesses while providing a safer route for cyclists[^1][^7].
- **Litigation and Delays**: Legal challenges have stalled construction repeatedly, making it one of Seattle's most prolonged infrastructure disputes[^1][^9].


### How It Reached This State

1. **Historical Background**: The Burke-Gilman Trail was initially developed on a former railroad corridor and opened in sections starting in 1978. While most of the 27-mile trail is complete, the Ballard segment has remained contentious due to its industrial setting[^5][^10].
2. **Legal and Community Opposition**: Since the 1990s, lawsuits and environmental reviews have hindered construction. Local businesses argue that the trail would disrupt industrial operations and increase liability risks[^1][^9].
3. **City Efforts**: Successive city administrations have allocated funds and conducted studies to close the gap. However, these efforts have been met with resistance, forcing SDOT to consider alternative routes[^7][^9].

The Missing Link remains a critical gap in an otherwise seamless multi-use trail that serves thousands of commuters and recreational users daily. While progress has been slow, recent proposals aim to resolve the impasse and complete this vital connection[^1][^7][^9].
