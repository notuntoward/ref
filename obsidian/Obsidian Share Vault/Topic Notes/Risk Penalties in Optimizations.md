# Variance penalty
Just subtract off the weighted variance of scenarios, given decisions from 1st stage of stock opt.  
- Somewhere, I read it was associated with higher long term return in finance (source?)
- Is double sided, so not specifically sensitive to downside risk, unlike, say [[#Semi-Deviance]]
# Semi-Deviation
