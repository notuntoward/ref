About pacemakers, drugs that often go with them, and Jack and Dad's experience with this stuff.
# Flutter / Afib / Flubber
- `flutter`: consistent, steady arrythmia
	- only controllable by ignoring atrium, pacing
- `afib`: atrium is just noisy, varying in frequency, amplitude
	- not pacemaker controllable
- `flubber`: both flutter and afib
# Drugs vs. Pacemaker
- The purpose of Jack's pacemaker is to prevent the drug that controls his flutter/afib/flubber from calming his heart so much that it stops.
- flutter/afib/flubber aren't controllable by pacemaker, only by drugs
	- Jack thinks his doctor thinks this
	- [ ] ? is it true that drugs being the only way to control? Doesn't Dad's pacemaker control afib with no drugs?

# Jack's hyperactive pacemaker

The history, as I understand it, is that afib was bad enough that it caused clotting and a small stroke, so doctors tried to ablate some bad nerves twice, which wasn't successful.

They also gave Jack a drug, solitol (sp?) 

- [ ] ? did they try the drug first, and then do the ablation?

Whenever the drug happened, it messed up his biking -- his CO was slow that he could barely climb big, long hills, and at the top, he was miserable, with a ghostly pale pallor. He also fainted once in a while (remember at Karen's couch, I think after this drug started).  Worse, the drug was so powerful enough that it almost stopped his heart.

So, they installed a pacemaker to make sure HR never went to zero.

But the pacemaker caused problems:
- racing heart when he put on his shirt (see [[Lau89snglChmbrCardiacPace]] about arm swinging effect)
- clipped maximum heart rate below the setting in the pacemaker (related to refractory period in [[Mond88rateResponsPace]]?)
- [ ] ? one other thing?

Pacemaker tweaking didn't help, so he switched to a new drug, flacinol (sp?), which worked worse than solitol (sp?), so he switched back and the doctor changed dosage, which didn't help either.  This is so far, as of 10/2/24, but he's hoping for improvement once the effect of the return to dosage at the original, most successful dosage, has settled in (but I don't think that the pacemaker settings were restored).

Latest conclusion: after another exam, the Dr. gave him two options: another ablation, or yet another drug, which required 3 days in the hospital for a test run. As of 10/2/24, Jack's going for the new drug. It will be another month before the hospital test run.

- [ ] ? name of the hospital drug?
# Dad's Pacemaker

Seems to be working well, so far, as of 10/2/24
