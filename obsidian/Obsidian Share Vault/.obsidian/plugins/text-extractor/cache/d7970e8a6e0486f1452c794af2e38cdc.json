Box 2291 Omaha, NE 68103-2291 Scott Otterson 2836 NW 63rd St Seattle, WA 98107 8/29/2024 Dear Scott Otterson: As your life events change, we know how important it is to remain covered by health insurance and that comparing all of the options can be confusing. While continuing your current coverage may be your best option, many Americans want to understand if they are eligible for tax subsidies under the Affordable Care Act to lower the cost of coverage. As part of our service to help you better understand your options and eligibility for subsidies, we have partnered with eHealth to provide a dedicated website and care center to assist you in exploring your options in addition to coverage under COBRA. eHealth is the country’s most complete online portal for finding health insurance. Please visit www.ehealth.com/Igoe or call 866-209-3360 to speak with a eHealth representative for more information. COBRA Continuation Coverage Election Notice Instructions On 8/20/2024, you experienced an event of a/an Termination which constitutes a qualifying event under the Growing Energy Labs Inc. group health plan(s). As a result, your coverage, and that of your covered dependent(s), if any, will end on the date(s) set forth on the COBRA Continuation Election Form accompanying this letter. This notice has important information about your right to continue your health care coverage. Please read the information in this notice very carefully before you make your decision. Under the provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) this entitles you and your covered dependent(s) if any, to elect to continue coverage (referred to as COBRA coverage) under the plan(s) enrolled as active member(s). The first day of COBRA coverage and the maximum continuation period is determined by plan. Please refer to your COBRA Election Form enclosed to determine your first day of COBRA coverage and maximum continuation period (\"Last Day of COBRA\"). Please note that qualified beneficiaries for COBRA are listed on the Election Form contained herein. How to Elect COBRA Coverage Under COBRA, you have a limited number of days to elect continuation coverage. Your election window is determined by the plan and is calculated from the date your coverage under the plan is lost because of the event described above or the date this notice of your election rights is sent to you, whichever is later. To elect COBRA coverage, you must complete and submit the enclosed election form to Igoe Administrative Services no later than the Election Period End date (\"Last Day to Elect\") listed on the enclosed COBRA Election Form. This same notice is being sent separately to your spouse, if any and if residing at a different address; however, only one of you needs to elect continuation coverage for your spouse and dependent child(ren), if any, who wish to continue coverage. Furthermore, because COBRA gives you the right to elect coverage independently, you, your spouse or dependent child(ren), if any, may elect single coverage and not include those individuals who do not wish to continue coverage. Other Health Coverage Options In addition to COBRA coverage, other health coverage options may be available to you, such as coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace at www.healthcare.gov or 1-800-318-2596. You may also be eligible to enroll in coverage through Medicaid or another group health plan (like a spouse’s plan), if you request enrollment within 30 days of the loss of coverage. Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. Page 1 of 14 1GDE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES 00136 013 0001898031 You should compare your other coverage options with COBRA continuation coverage and choose the coverage that is best for you. For example, if you move to other coverage you may pay more out of pocket than you would under COBRA because the new coverage may impose a new deductible. When you lose job-based health coverage, it’s important that you choose carefully between COBRA continuation coverage and other coverage options, because once you’ve made your choice, it can be difficult or impossible to switch to another coverage option. Can I enroll in Medicare instead of COBRA continuation coverage after my group health plan coverage ends? In general, if you don't enroll in Medicare Part A or B when you are first eligible because you are still employed, after the initial enrollment period for Medicare Part A or B, you have an 8-month special enrollment period to sign up, beginning on the earlier of - The month after your employment ends; or - The month after group health plan coverage based on current employment ends. If you don't enroll in Medicare Part B and elect COBRA continuation coverage instead, you may have to pay a Part B late enrollment penalty and you may have a gap in coverage if you decide you want Part B later. If you elect COBRA continuation coverage and then enroll in Medicare Part A or B before the COBRA continuation coverage ends, the Plan may terminate your continuation coverage. However, if Medicare Part A or B is effective on or before the date of the COBRA election, COBRA coverage may not be discontinued on account of Medicare entitlement, even if you enroll in the other part of Medicare after the date of the election of COBRA coverage. If you are enrolled in both COBRA continuation coverage and Medicare, Medicare will generally pay first (primary payer) and COBRA will pay second. Certain COBRA continuation coverage plans may pay as if secondary to Medicare, even if you are not enrolled in Medicare. For more information visit https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-and-you. Payment of COBRA Coverage Premiums The current amount of this premium and the due date for payment are explained in the enclosed COBRA Election Form. The premium may change in the future. We have used the information supplied by Growing Energy Labs Inc. to calculate your maximum continuation period under the plan(s) you were insured under prior to your qualifying event. If there is a discrepancy between our calculation and the underwriting insurance carrier, the insurance carrier always governs. Please contact your insurance carrier(s) to determine the exact end of your maximum continuation period. Length of COBRA Coverage Period If you and your spouse or dependent child(ren), if any, elect coverage, it can last for a maximum continuation period (\"Last Day of COBRA\") described in the enclosed COBRA Election Form beginning on the date of your qualifying event, or loss of coverage, whichever is later. The first day of COBRA coverage will be determined by the plan. The continuation period may be extended for the following reasons: 1. Death of employee, divorce, legal separation or change in dependent status If these events occur during the original maximum continuation period of COBRA coverage, the period of coverage for your spouse and dependent child(ren), if any, may be extended. These events extend the original maximum continuation period of COBRA coverage only if they would have caused your spouse or dependent child(ren), if any, to lose coverage under the plan if the original qualifying event had not occurred. Note that to receive this extension, you and/or your spouse and dependent child(ren), must notify the Growing Energy Labs Inc. Plan Administrator within 60 days of the occurrence of these events. 2. Medicare entitlement of employee If you became entitled to Medicare BEFORE your qualifying event, COBRA laws allow you to remain eligible for up to 18 months of COBRA coverage. However, your spouse and dependent child(ren), if any, may receive extended COBRA coverage for up to the greater of either: (a) 36 months from the date of your Medicare entitlement; or (b) 18 months from the date of your qualifying event, or loss of coverage, whichever is later. Page 2 of 1400136 013 0001898031 If you become entitled to Medicare AFTER your qualifying event but within the original maximum continuation period of your qualifying event, your spouse and dependent child(ren), if any, may receive an additional 18 months of COBRA coverage. Note that a person generally has become entitled to Medicare when he or she has applied for Social Security income payments or has filed an application for benefits under Part A or Part B of Medicare. 3. Disability determination If it is determined that you and/or your spouse or dependent child(ren), if any, were determined to be disabled (by the Social Security Administration) during the first 60 days of COBRA coverage and you are still disabled at the end of your original maximum continuation period of coverage, the original maximum continuation period may be extended for an additional 11 months for all individuals covered under COBRA coverage from the date of the qualifying event. This extension only applies if the Growing Energy Labs Inc. Plan Administrator is notified within 60 days of a disability determination and before the end of the original maximum continuation period. Federal law requires that you notify the Growing Energy Labs Inc. Plan Administrator of a determination by the Social Security Administration that you, your spouse, or dependent child(ren) are no longer disabled within 30 days of such a determination. Growing Energy Labs Inc. can be reached at (510) 612-7257 during business hours. 4. Bankruptcy filing If the employer files for bankruptcy reorganization and retiree health coverage is lost within one year before or after the bankruptcy filing, COBRA coverage could continue until the death of a retiree (or a surviving spouse of a deceased retiree) or for 36 months from the retiree's death (after the bankruptcy filing) in the case of the spouse and dependent child(ren). Newborns and Adoptees A child who is born to or placed for adoption with you during a period of COBRA coverage will be eligible to become covered under the plan. In accordance with the terms of the Growing Energy Labs Inc. group health benefits plan and the requirements of Federal law, these qualified beneficiaries can be added to COBRA coverage upon proper notification to the Growing Energy Labs Inc. Plan Administrator of the birth or adoption. Early Termination of COBRA Coverage COBRA coverage may terminate early if: (1) The required premium payment is not paid when due. (2) After the date of your COBRA election, you and your spouse or dependent child(ren), if any, become covered under another group health plan. (3) After the date of your COBRA election, you, your spouse or dependent child(ren), if any, become entitled to Medicare benefits. (4) All of Growing Energy Labs Inc. group health plans are terminated. (5) If coverage is extended an additional 11 months due to disability, a determination that the individual is no longer disabled. (6) COBRA coverage may also be terminated for any reason the plan would terminate coverage of a participant or beneficiary not receiving COBRA coverage (such as fraud). Continuation coverage under COBRA is provided subject to your eligibility. The Growing Energy Labs Inc. Plan Administrator reserves the right to terminate your COBRA coverage retroactively if you are determined to be ineligible for coverage. To be sure that you, your spouse and your dependent child(ren), if any, receive the necessary information concerning your rights, you should keep Igoe Administrative Services informed of any address changes. If you sign up for COBRA continuation coverage, you can switch to a Marketplace plan during a Marketplace open enrollment period. You can also end your COBRA continuation coverage early and switch to a Marketplace plan if you have another qualifying event such as marriage or birth of a child through something called a “special enrollment period.” If you terminate COBRA continuation early without another qualifying event, you’ll have to wait to enroll in Marketplace coverage until the next open enrollment period and may be without health coverage in the interim’. When you’ve exhausted COBRA continuation and the coverage expires, you’ll be eligible to enroll in Marketplace coverage through a special enrollment period even if the Marketplace open enrollment has ended. If you sign up for Marketplace coverage instead of COBRA, you cannot switch to COBRA continuation coverage. Please be advised of your right to obtain a copy of the Summary Plan Description (SPD) for your group health plan by contacting the Growing Energy Labs Inc. Human Resource Department at (510) 612-7257. The SPD contains a complete description of your benefits. Page 3 of 1400136 013 0001898031 This notice is a summary of your COBRA rights.

The Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 – Annual Notice The Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA) was signed into law on October 21, 1998. The law includes important new protections for mastectomy patients who elect breast reconstruction in connection with a mastectomy. WHCRA amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and is administered by the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services. Among other things, WHCRA requires that group health plans and health insurance issuers, including insurance companies and HMOs, notify individuals at three separate instances (after the enactment of the Act, upon enrollment, and annually) regarding the coverage required by WHCRA. The one-time notification provision required plans and issuers to inform participants and beneficiaries no later than January 1, 1999 of the coverage required by WHCRA. The permanent notification provision requires plans and issuers to notify participants upon enrollment and annually thereafter of the benefits required under WHCRA. The Departments believe that employers, unions, and health insurance issuers play a key role in educating participants, beneficiaries, and covered individuals and should have some flexibility in determining how best to educate consumers about their rights under WHCRA. As part of our plan’s compliance with this ACT, we are required to provide you with this annual notice outlining the coverage that this law requires our plan to provide. 1 If you are receiving this notice as a result of a COBRA Qualifying Event, this deadline does not apply to you. You have the full COBRA election period to make your initial election choices as well as your open enrollment choices. 00136 035 0001898031 Page 9 of 14 Our group health plan has always provided coverage for medically necessary mastectomies. This coverage includes procedures to reconstruct the breast, on which the mastectomy was performed, as well as the cost of necessary prostheses (implants, special bras, etc.) and treatment of any physical complications resulting from any stage of the mastectomy. However, as a result of this federal law, the plan now provides coverage for surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to achieve a symmetrical appearance and any complications that could result from that surgery. The following benefits must be provided if benefits are provided for a mastectomy: 1. Coverage for reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy is performed. 2. Coverage for surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance with the breast on which the mastectomy is performed. 3. Coverage for prostheses and physical complications resulting from any stage of the mastectomy, including lymphedemas. These benefits are subject to the same deductible, co-pays and coinsurance that apply to mastectomy benefits under the plan. If you have any questions regarding this Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Notice please contact your medical insurance carrier. Premium Assistance Under Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) If you or your children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and you’re eligible for health coverage from your employer, your state may have a premium assistance program that can help pay for coverage, using funds from their Medicaid or CHIP programs. If you or your children aren’t eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, you won’t be eligible for these premium assistance programs but you may be able to buy individual insurance coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. For more information, visit www.healthcare.gov. If you or your dependents are already enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and you live in a State listed below, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office to find out if premium assistance is available. If you or your dependents are NOT currently enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, and you think you or any of your dependents might be eligible for either of these programs, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office or dial 1-877-KIDS NOW or www.insurekidsnow.gov to find out how to apply. If you qualify, ask your state if it has a program that might help you pay the premiums for an employer-sponsored plan. If you or your dependents are eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP, as well as eligible under your employer plan, your employer must allow you to enroll in your employer plan if you aren’t already enrolled. This is called a “special enrollment” opportunity, and you must request coverage within 60 days of being determined eligible for premium assistance. If you have questions about enrolling in your employer plan, contact the Department of Labor at www.askebsa.dol.gov or call 1-866-444-EBSA (3272).
