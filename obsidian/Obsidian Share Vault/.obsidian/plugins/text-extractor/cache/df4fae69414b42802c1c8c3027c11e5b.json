LaPaglia* and Jason C. K. Chan‡ A number of recent studies have found that recalling details of an event following its occurrence can increase people’s suggestibility to later presented misinformation. How- ever, several other studies have reported the opposite result, whereby earlier retrieval can reduce subsequent eyewitness suggestibility. In the present study, we investigated whether differences in the way misinformation is presented can modulate the effects of testing on suggestibility. Participants watched a video of a robbery and some were questioned about the event immediately afterwards. Later, participants were exposed to misinformation in a narrative (Experiment 1) or in questions (Experiment 2). Consistent with previous studies, we found that testing increased suggestibility when misinformation was presented via a narrative. Remarkably, when misinformation was presented in ques- tions, testing decreased suggestibility. Copyright # 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. In a recent New Jersey ruling, there was a reformulation of juror instructions aimed at clarifying how eyewitness testimony should be evaluated (Weiser, 2012). The new instruc- tions educate jurors on ﬁndings from decades of research demonstrating the fallibility of eyewitness memory. Indeed, memory for an event or perpetrator can be drastically altered when witnesses are exposed to misleading post-event information (the misinformation effect; for a review, see Loftus, 2005). More relevant to the present research is a counter- intuitive ﬁnding that has been reported in a series of studies; namely, that recalling the details of an event can increase eyewitness suggestibility to later presented misinformation (e.g., Chan, Thomas, & Bulevich, 2009; Chan & LaPaglia, 2011). This ﬁnding, termed retrieval-enhanced suggestibility (RES), is surprising because retrieval often enhances retention of an event (i.e., the testing effect; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006). Given that retrieval practice is such a powerful memory enhancer, the logical pre- diction is that completing a recall test for a witnessed event soon after its occurrence should enhance retention of that event and thus protect witnesses from later suggestions. Consistent with this idea, having a better memory for a witnessed event is often associated with lower susceptibility to misinformation. For example, improved encoding of a witnessed event can reduce the misinformation effect (Lane, 2006; Pezdek & Roe, 1995). Similarly, the impact of misinformation is weaker when the witnessed event is still “fresh in the mind” than if forgetting has set in (e.g., Chan & Langley, 2011; Loftus, Miller, & Burns, 1978). However, contrary to the prediction that testing would reduce *Correspondence to: Jessica A.

A two-factor account has been proposed to explain the RES phenomenon. The ﬁrst fac- tor suggests that initial testing may paradoxically enhance learning of the subsequent misinformation (Gordon & Thomas, 2013), thus increasing its likelihood of being recalled later (e.g., Zaragoza & Mitchell, 1996). For example, after watching a bank robbery video, participants may be asked about the amount of time the robber gives the police to gather the ransom. Later, when participants heard misinformation regarding this detail, the initial test question may inadvertently draw attention to, and thus enhance the encoding of, this misinformation. The second factor suggests that performing retrieval may trigger recon- solidation of the original memory, thus allowing the misinformation to update the original memory trace and making later recall of the original memory more difﬁcult. A growing body of evidence has suggested that previously consolidated memories re-enter a labile state upon retrieval and must be reconsolidated, and the reactivated memories are partic- ularly susceptible to disruption during this reconsolidation window (Chan & LaPaglia, 2013). Indeed, reconsolidation-based memory updating has been suggested to play a central role in false memories in humans (Hardt, Einarsson, & Nader, 2010). Although the RES effect shows that testing can be detrimental to the accuracy of eyewitness memory, several studies have reported the contrary, such that initial testing can protect eyewitnesses from misleading suggestions (e.g., Gabbert, Hope, Fisher, & Jamieson, 2012; LaPaglia & Chan, 2012; Memon, Zaragoza, Clifford, & Kidd, 2010; Pansky & Tenenboim, 2011; Saunders & MacLeod, 2002). Numerous methodological differences between these sets of studies likely contribute to the disparity in the effects of testing on suggestibility. For example, compared with studies demonstrating RES, the studies that showed a testing effect used different to-be-remembered materials (faces instead of events; LaPaglia & Chan, 2012), types of misinformation suggested [central details instead of peripheral details (Gabbert et al., 2012); self-fabricated misinformation instead of experimenter-provided misinformation (Memon et al., 2010)], and type of initial test administered (the Self-Administered Interview instead of a standard recall test; Gabbert et al., 2012). It is beyond the scope of the present study to address the potential contribution of all of these variables, so we focus on one factor that might determine whether initial testing enhances or exacerbates eyewitness suggestibility. Speciﬁcally, we examined whether variations in the way misinformation is presented (i.e., in a narrative or misleading questions) modiﬁes the inﬂuence of prior testing on suggestibility. This variable is of particular interest because studies that have found initial testing to reduce suggestibility often presented misinformation in questions (Pansky & Tenenboim, 2011; Saunders & MacLeod, 2002), whereas studies that have demonstrated RES always presented misinformation in a narrative. In an experiment conducted by Saunders and MacLeod (2002), participants read two written narratives describing separate burglaries. After the encoding phase, participants were tested on half of the items from one of the burglaries, while all remaining items were not tested. Participants then completed a free recall test for all the studied items before misinformation was introduced via misleading questions. For instance, one narrative mentioned that the burglars stole a necklace that was next to the sink. During the misinformation phase, participants responded to the question, “When the burglars stole the earrings that were next to the sink in the kitchen, they knocked some items on the ﬂoor breaking them. What did they break?” Performance was then measured in a forced-choice 594 J. A. LaPaglia and J. C. K. Chan Copyright # 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Behav. Sci. Law 31: 593–606 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/bsl recognition test. Unlike studies reporting RES, Saunders and MacLeod found that participants were less likely to select the misinformation for the tested items than for the non-tested items. Three key differences between Saunders and MacLeod’s (2002) study and studies that found RES might have contributed to these contrasting ﬁndings. First, initial retrieval accuracy was far higher (~89% of questions were recalled correctly) in Saunders and MacLeod’s study than was typically observed in studies that reported RES (~55% initial test accuracy). This is important because highly recallable items (i.e., easy items, central items) are more resistant to the RES effect than items that are more difﬁcult to remember (e.g., peripheral items; Chan & Langley, 2011; Wilford, Chan, & Tuhn, 2013). So it is possible that Saunders and MacLeod’s critical items were easily remembered and thus not susceptible to the RES effect. Secondly, because all participants had completed a free recall test before they were exposed to misinformation, there was no true no-test control condition in this study. Thirdly, and of particular relevance to the current study, the misinformation was presented within misleading questions (as opposed to a narrative). Retrieving information while being exposed to misinformation is different from passively listening to or reading misinformation presented in a narrative, and this may play a key role in determining whether testing would increase or decrease subsequent suggestibility. In Pansky and Tenenboim’s (2011) study, participants viewed a slideshow as their critical event and then took a test over some of the information before they were exposed to misinformation. A ﬁnal test was given 48 hours later. Pansky and Tenenboim found that participants were less suggestible for the tested items than for the non-tested items. This study is of particular interest because its methodology is highly similar to the studies reporting RES. In an attempt to explain the inconsistencies between their results and those reported by Chan et al. (2009), Pansky and Tenenboim (2011) pointed to four methodological differences: the length of the event video; initial testing manipulated within versus between subjects; a 48-hour versus 30-minute retention interval; and misinformation introduced via questions versus narrative. Based on current knowledge, the ﬁrst three differences are likely irrelevant, because the RES effect has been demon- strated across different witnessed event lengths (Chan et al., 2009, 2012), retention intervals (Chan & Langley, 2011), and in both within- and between-subjects designs (Chan & LaPaglia, 2011). We are thus left with the fourth methodological difference – that Pansky and Tenenboim presented their misinformation via written questions, whereas studies showing RES presented misinformation in a narrative. As is apparent from this brief review, initial testing can reduce or increase suggestibility, although the processes underlying the opposite patterns of results are unknown. We suspect that these discrepant ﬁndings are related to the way in which misinformation is presented. Here we examine whether variations in how misinformation is delivered (namely, via questions or via a narrative) alter the inﬂuence of testing on eyewitness suggestibility. Several studies have investigated the impact of the misinformation presentation method on suggestibility, and the results are mixed. For example, Zaragoza and Lane (1994) found that presenting misinformation in questions increased suggestibility relative to presenting misinformation in a narrative. Similarly, Saunders (2009) reported that misleading questions are more effective at inducing false memories than is a narrative, although this effect was only observed for misinformation regarding central details and not peripheral details. Gobbo (2000) showed that presenting misinformation in questions alone produced a smaller misinformation effect than presenting misinformation in both Testing and suggestibility 595 Copyright # 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Behav. Sci. Law 31: 593–606 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/bsl questions and a narrative (such that the misinformation was repeated). Unfortunately, it is impossible to disentangle the effects of misinformation repetition and presentation method in this study. Moreover, presenting misinformation in questions that do not presuppose the truth of the misinformation, but rather questions its existence (e.g., “I used the Dove soap, was it Dove?”) can eliminate the misinformation effect altogether (Lee & Chen, 2012). In sum, if we were to draw a preliminary conclusion based on extant ﬁndings, it appears that question-based misinformation might be more effective at inducing false recall than narrative-based misinformation, though this effect is far from universal. More important for present purposes, however, is that we know virtually noth- ing about whether testing would alter this tentative relationship. The Current Study In two experiments, participants watched a video of a bank robbery. Afterwards, partici- pants in the test condition took an initial recall test over the contents of the video. For instance, one critical detail in the present experiments is the amount of time the bank robber gives the police to meet his demands. In the initial test, participants were asked, “How long does the robber give the police to get him the money?” The correct answer to this question is 2 hours. After a short delay, they either listened to a narrative containing misinformation (Experiment 1) or responded to new questions containing misin- formation (Experiment 2). If the misinformation was presented in a narrative, participants heard: “The robber demands that the police get him his money and a car in 1 hour.” If the misinformation was presented in a question, participants were asked: “In addition to the money, the robber gives the police 1 hour to also get him what?” Later, all participants completed a ﬁnal recall test over the video. The question here was whether an RES effect would remain when misinformation was presented in questions. We hypothesized that, compared with presenting misinformation in a narrative, presenting misinformation in questions may result in an elimination of the RES effect. Attempting to answer a question, as opposed to passively listening to a narrative, could encourage participants to engage in more effortful processing (Carpenter, 2009; Pyc & Rawson, 2009). More concretely, research has shown that taking a recall test can some- times trigger spontaneous retrieval of related information in memory (Chan, 2009). When placed into the present context, answering the misleading question about what the robber demanded (a getaway car) may lead participants to covertly retrieve the related detail (i.e., he needed the car in 2 hours). This would increase the likelihood that one would detect a discrepancy between one’s memory (from either the video event itself or from the response produced during the initial test, or both) and the misinformation (e.g., the robber needed the car in 1 hour), thereby reducing the inﬂuence of the misinformation (Tousignant, Hall, & Loftus, 1986). In fact, based on this logic, it is possible that presenting misinformation in questions might not only eliminate the RES effect, it may reverse it, such that testing would reduce the misinformation effect. Notably, we believe that question-based misinformation would reduce suggestibility relative to narrative- based misinformation only for participants who have received an initial test. Speciﬁcally, we believe that participants would be far more likely to notice contradictions between their memory and the misinformation in the question if they have produced an overt response of that very detail during the initial test. A further prediction from this logic is that testing would reduce question-based misinformation only if participants can recall the critical detail correctly during the initial test. 596 J. A. LaPaglia and J. C. K. Chan Copyright # 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Behav. Sci. Law 31: 593–606 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/bsl EXPERIMENT 1 In the ﬁrst experiment, we attempted to extend the RES effect with narrative presentation to a new set of witnessed event materials. Although a number of studies have demon- strated RES, most have used the same 40-minute-long video of a terrorist attack as the witnessed event (e.g., Chan et al., 2009; Chan & LaPaglia, 2011). One other published study has demonstrated the effect with a 10-minute video event of a museum burglary (Chan et al., 2012). Here we developed a new video featuring a bank robbery, and the length of the video was somewhere between the longer (40 minutes) video and the shorter (10 minutes) video. Therefore, ﬁnding RES with this new set of materials would further ascertain its generalizability. Method Participants and Design Experiment 1 used a 2 (test vs. no test) × 2 (post-event information: neutral vs. misled) mixed design. Test vs. no test was manipulated between subjects. Post-event information was manipulated within subjects. There were 20 participants in each between-subjects con- dition for a total of 40 participants (23 males). Their mean age was 19.50 years (SD = 1.18). Participants were undergraduate students from a Midwestern university who took part in this experiment for partial course credit. The experiment consisted of four main phases. First, participants completed the encoding phase in which they viewed the witnessed event video. Secondly, participants completed the no-test/test phase. Here, they either performed a distractor task or a recall test. Thirdly, participants were exposed to misinformation via an audio narrative. Finally, participants were administered the ﬁnal recall test. Materials and Procedure Participants began by watching a 25-minute video from an episode of the television show Flashpoint. The video depicted a bank robbery by a disgruntled former employee. Participants were given intentional encoding instructions. Speciﬁcally, they were told to pay close attention to the video, including the actions and surrounding environment, because their memory would be tested later. Following the video, participants in the no-test condition played the videogame Tetris for 7 minutes as a distractor activity, whereas partic- ipants in the test condition took a cued recall test over their memory for the video. This test consisted of 14 open-ended, non-leading questions (e.g., “How long does the robber give thepolicetoget himthe money?”). Participants were given 30 seconds to answer each question and the initial test phase lasted 7 minutes. They were told to be as accurate as possible and not to guess. No corrective feedback was given. Once participants completed the initial test or Tetris, they were shown another video to ﬁll a retention interval. The video was a clip from the BBC show Spooks. It depicted a terrorist plot against abortion doctors and lasted approximately 20 minutes. Participants were told that they should pay close attention to the video, but they were not told whether their memory for the video would be tested later. Following the distractor video, participants were presented with misinformation embedded within an audio narrative via headphones. The audio narrative lasted roughly Testing and suggestibility 597 Copyright # 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Behav. Sci. Law 31: 593–606 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/bsl 6 minutes. All 14 critical details queried in the initial test were included in the narrative. The critical details were either presented as a misled item or a neutral item. For example, one critical detail was the amount of time the robber gave police to get him the money. If this detail was presented as misinformation, the participants heard that the robber gave the police 1 hour (when he had in fact given them 2 hours). If this detail was presented as a neutral item, participants heard that the robber asked for money, but the amount of time was not speciﬁed. Half of the items were misled and the other half were neutral. Whether a detail was misled or not was counterbalanced across participants. Following a 25-minute ﬁlled retention interval in which participants completed the Reading Span working memory task (Unsworth, Heitz, Schrock, & Engle, 2005) and played Tetris, they took the ﬁnal test (which was identical to the initial test). Participants were told to answer the questions based only on their memory for the video. Immediately after each question, participants were asked to rate their conﬁdence in their response from 1(“I guessed”)to 5 (“Iamverysure”). After the ﬁnal test, participants completed a short demographic questionnaire. Results and Discussion Initial Test Responses in the initial and ﬁnal tests were classiﬁed as correct, matching the misinformation presented later (i.e., spontaneous misinformation recall), no response (i.e., a blank response or “Idon’tknow”), or an other response (i.e., any response that was incorrect but did not match the misinformation). Correct recall probability was similar to previousRES studies(M = 0.64) and spontaneous misinformation recall probability was, as expected, very low (M = 0.07) (see Table 1 for the complete data on the initial test). Final Test We focus our data analysis on the correct and misinformation recall probabilities (see Figure 1). For the sake of completeness, data regarding the “other” and “no response” types are given in Table 2. Correct Recall. A 2 (no test, test) × 2 (post-event information: misled, neutral) ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant interaction [F(1, 38) = 4.14, p =0.05 , ηp 2 =0.10]. Speciﬁcally, the tested participants recalled fewer correct details (M = 0.35) than the non-tested partici- pants (M = 0.52) for the misled items [t(38) = 3.35, p =0.002, d = 0.80] but not for neutral items (t < 1, p = 0.73). That is, initial testing reduced accurate recall when participants were misled – a reversed testing effect. There was also a signiﬁcant main effect of post- event information, such that participants recalled more correct details for neutral items (M = 0.59) than for misled items (M =0.44) [F(1, 38) = 10.51, p = 0.002 , ηp 2 =0.22]. The main effect of initial testing was not signiﬁcant [F(1, 38) = 2.83, p =0.10, ηp 2 =0.07]. Table 1.

A 2 (no test, test) × 2 (post-event information) ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant interaction [F(1, 38) = 13.72, p = 0.001, ηp 2 = 0.27]. Testing nearly doubled the misinformation recall probability for the misled items [t(38) = 3.35, p = 0.002, d = 1.05], which was an RES effect (M = 0.47 for test and M = 0.24 for no test), but (as expected) not for the neutral items (t < 1, p = 0.44). Not surprisingly, there was a signiﬁcant misinformation effect overall, with greater misinformation recall probabilities for the misled items (M = 0.35) than for the neutral items (M =0.07) [F(1, 38) = 70.99, p < 0.001, ηp 2 = 0.65]. The main effect of testing was also signiﬁcant [F(1, 38) = 6.93, p = 0.01, ηp 2 =0.15]. During testimony, a witness may be prompted to respond only when they are highly conﬁdent. Using the conﬁdence data collected in the ﬁnal test phase, we examined misinformation recall probability only for responses in which participants were highly conﬁdent (a conﬁdence rating of 4 or 5, corresponding to “Iam sure” or “Iam verysure”, respectively). Remarkably, even among these highly conﬁdent responses, the RES effect remained intact (M = 0.48 for tested and M =0.25 for non-tested) [t(38) = 2.37, p =0.02, d = 0.77]. To further investigate the effect of initial testing on later suggestibility, we performed a conditional analysis examining ﬁnal test accuracy depending on whether .00 .10 .20 .30 .40 .50 .60 .70 Neutral Misled Neutral Misled Correct Recall Misinformation RecallRecall Probability No-Test Test Figure 1.

Behav. Sci. Law 31: 593–606 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/bsl the participant successfully recalled an item on the initial test. Not surprisingly, tested participants who were initially incorrect for a given item were more likely to recall the misinformation on the ﬁnal test (M = 0.56) than otherwise (M = 0.43 for initially correct items), although the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant [t(19) = 1.29, p =0.21, d = 0.37]. However, more surprising is the fact that being able to recall an item correctly during the initial test by no means protected one from the inﬂuence of RES, as the misinformation recall probability for these initially correct items was still far greater than that in the no-test condition (M =0.24) [t(38) = 3.76, p < 0.001, d = 1.19]. Moreover, misinformation had a powerful negative effect on retention of these initially correct items, dropping correct recall probability on the ﬁnal test from 0.88 (neutral items) to 0.54 (misled items) [t(19) = 3.29, p =0.003]. EXPERIMENT 2 In Experiment 1, we generalized the RES effect to a new set of materials. Experiment 2 included the same four phases as Experiment 1 (i.e., encoding, no test/test, misinfor- mation introduction, ﬁnal test), except that the misinformation was embedded in ques- tions instead of a narrative. Method Participants A total of 40 participants (25 male) were tested, with 20 each in the no-test and test conditions, respectively. Their mean age was 19.65 (SD = 2.09). Materials and Procedure The materials and procedure of Experiment 2 were identical to Experiment 1 with the exception of the misinformation phase. During the misinformation phase, participants were presented with 14 questions, each querying a non-critical detail about the video. Seven of the questions included a piece of misinformation (misled items), whereas the remaining questions presented no misleading information (neutral items). Participants were given 30 seconds to answer each question. One question that included misinformation was “In addition to the money, the robber gives the police 1 hour to also get him what?” In this case, like Experiment 1, the misinformation was the time (1 hour) the robber gave the police. Note that participants were always asked about the non-critical details during the misinformation phase. Results and Discussion Initial Test Initial and ﬁnal test data were coded in the same manner as described in Experiment 1 (see Table 1 for initial test recall probabilities). Not surprisingly, the correct recall proba- bility was similar to Experiment 1 (M = 0.58) and spontaneous misinformation recall probability was again low (M =0.03). 600 J. A. LaPaglia and J. C. K. Chan Copyright # 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Behav. Sci. Law 31: 593–606 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/bsl Misleading Questions Phase In Experiment 1, the misinformation was presented in a narrative that did not require any responses from participants. In Experiment 2, the misinformation was introduced in a memory test of the non-critical details. Responses from the misleading questions were coded as either correct, no response,or other responses. Recall probabilities are presented in Table 3. Correct recall probability was marginally lower for the tested par- ticipants (M = 0.76) than the non-tested participants (M = 0.82) [t(38) = 1.78, p = 0.08, d = 0.55}. Tested participants had more “I don’t know” and blank responses (M = 0.08) than non-tested participants (M = 0.04); this difference was again only marginally signiﬁcant [t(38) = 1.88, p = 0.07, d = 0.55]. These data suggest that completing the initial test might have disrupted recall of related information, a ﬁnding known as retrieval-induced forgetting (Anderson, 2003). However, we caution against any strong conclusions here because the difference was small and only marginally signiﬁcant. We consider the possible cause for this pattern more thoroughly in the general discussion. Final Test Correct Recall. Correct and misinformation recall probabilities are presented in Figure 2 (see Table 2 for data in the “other” and “no response” categories). A 2 (test, no test) × 2 (post-event information) ANOVA showed no signiﬁcant interaction or main effects of testing and post-event information (all F < 2.52, p > 0.12). Table 3.

Sci. Law 31: 593–606 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/bsl Misinformation Recall. As expected, a 2 (test, no test) × 2 (post-event information) ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant misinformation effect, with participants reporting more misinformation for the misled items (M = 0.20) than for the neutral items (M = 0.02) [F(1, 38) = 27.34, p < 0.001, ηp 2 = 0.42]. Far more interesting, however, is the fact that a testing effect, instead of RES, was observed [F(1, 38) = 12.34, p =0.001, ηp 2 = 0.25] such that overall misinformation recall probability was higher for the non-tested participants (M = 0.14) than for the tested participants (M = 0.08). Moreover, these main effects were qualiﬁed by a marginally signiﬁcant interaction [F(1, 38) = 3.00, p =0.09, ηp 2 =0.07], which is driven by the fact that testing substantially reduced misinformation recall proba- bility for the misled items (M = 0.14 for the test condition and M = 0.26 for the no-test condition) [t(38) = 2.40, p =0.02, d = 0.78], but (unsurprisingly) not for the neutral items [t(38) = 1.44, p =0.16]. Like Experiment 1, we examined misinformation recall probabilities for the highly conﬁdent responses and again found a protective effect of testing (M = 0.08 for tested participants and M = 0.26 for non-tested participants) [t(37) = 2.41, p =0.02, d = 0.78]. We also performed a conditional analysis examining ﬁnal test accuracy depending on whether the participant successfully recalled an item on the initial test. Misinformation recall probability was very low (M = 0.10) for the initially correct items but remained quite high for the initially incorrect items (M =0.31) [t(18) = 2.36, p =0.03, d =0.77]. We again examined the effects of encountering misinformation on retention of the initially correct items. Unlike the result in Experiment 1, presenting misinformation had no effect on ﬁnal test correct recall probability here (M =0.93 for neutral and M =0.87 for misled) [t(19) = 1.39, p = 0.18]. GENERAL DISCUSSION In the present experiments, we sought to discover factors that govern whether retrieval exacerbates or reduces eyewitness suggestibility. We found that testing increased suggest- ibility when the misinformation was presented in a narrative; however, it protected against suggestibility when the misinformation was embedded in questions. These results help to clarify why, despite the apparently similar methodologies used in prior studies, testing has produced conﬂicting ﬁndings regarding its effects on eyewitness suggestibility. More broadly, the present data provide an important empirical advancement to our knowledge regarding the complex interplay between retrieval practice and suggestibility. In particular, the conditions under which witnesses encounter misinformation can have a profound impact on their suggestibility. Along these lines, prior research has shown that people are far less susceptible to misinformation delivered by a peer than by an authority ﬁgure (Ceci, Ross, & Toglia, 1987; Dodd & Bradshaw, 1980; Lampinen & Smith, 1995; Smith & Ellsworth, 1987; Underwood & Pezdek, 1998), and that repeatedly encountering misinformation can increase its likelihood of being reported later (Foster et al., 2012; Mitchell & Zaragoza, 1996; Zaragoza & Mitchell, 1996). As indicated in the introduction, some research has also shown that encountering misinformation from a narrative or a question can inﬂuence its effectiveness at altering memory reports, but the results are somewhat mixed. In the present study, a quick comparison between data from the two experiments reveals that presenting misinformation in a narrative or a question had virtu- ally no impact on eyewitness suggestibility when no initial test had taken place. However, far more interestingly, initial testing dramatically altered the relationship between 602 J. A. LaPaglia and J. C. K. Chan Copyright # 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Behav. Sci. Law 31: 593–606 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/bsl misinformation presentation method and its effectiveness in inducing false recall. Whereas testing exacerbated suggestibility when misinformation was presented in a narra- tive, it reduced suggestibility when misinformation was presented in a question. How can we account for these results? We hypothesized that testing might reduce suggestibility if misinformation is presented in a question because attempting to answer a question may cause participants to retrieve other related information in memory, and the tested participants would be more likely (than the non-tested subjects) to notice the inconsistency between the misinformation and what they remembered from the witnessed event. Consistent with this hypothesis, the testing effect in Experiment 2 was found only for items that were correctly recalled dur- ing the initial test. This ﬁnding suggests that conﬂict detection is driven primarily by people comparing their memory of what was recalled on the initial test (and not just what was seen in the video) with the misinformation. This remains a viable explanation for our ﬁndings. In an attempt to keep our experimental design as consistent as possible with former studies, the misinformation was presented in a story-like audio narrative that recapped much of the witnessed event in Experiment 1. By contrast, the misleading questions were presented in a similar fashion to previous studies that demonstrated a testing effect (e.g., Pansky & Tenenboim, 2011). Here, the questions were presented visually, partic- ipants were given 30 seconds to answer each question, and the 14 questions appeared without any background or contextual information about the story of the witnessed event. Owing to these differences, we cannot ascertain that the retrieval requirement in the questions was the sole contributor to the reversal of the RES effect. We are currently conducting follow-up experiments to further examine the mechanisms under- lying this interesting reversal. 1 An intriguing ﬁnding in Experiment 2 was that the tested participants displayed poorer performance on the misleading questions (for which they needed to recall the non-critical details) than the non-tested participants. One interpretation of this ﬁnding is that retriev- ing the critical details during the initial test might have impaired recall of the related, non- critical information (i.e., retrieval-induced forgetting). However, we cautioned against such an interpretation for three reasons. First, as described earlier, the impairment in re- call performance for the tested participants relative to the non-tested participants was only marginally signiﬁcant. Second, our materials were highly coherent and interconnected in nature, and materials like these are highly resistant to retrieval-induced forgetting (Chan, 2009; Chan & LaPaglia, 2011; Migueles & Garcia-Bajos, 2007). Third, and perhaps most intriguing, the decrement in performance for the tested participants might be the result of these participants noticing the inconsistencies between their memory of the video and the misinformation. Speciﬁcally, this conﬂict detection might have drawn attention away from the task at hand – retrieving the non-critical detail that was requested by the ques- tion. Such diversion of attention would thus lower performance during the misleading question phase. 1 A potential limitation is that we are making comparisons between studies. That is, the participants in Ex- periment 1 could differ from those in Experiment 2 because data for the two experiments were not collected simultaneously. However, we believe this is unlikely to have caused the different effects of testing in Experi- ments 1 and 2, because data for both experiments were collected within a 4-week period. Moreover, all par- ticipants were from the same university, participating for course credit, and the mean age of the participants did not differ between the experiments (t < 1, p = 0.69). Testing and suggestibility 603 Copyright # 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Behav. Sci. Law 31: 593–606 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/bsl CONCLUDING REMARKS Perhaps due to the popularity and excitement surrounding the idea that testing is a pow- erful retention enhancer (e.g., Rawson & Dunlosky, 2011; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006), there has been a recent surge of interest in applying retrieval practice to reduce eyewitness suggestibility and to improve eyewitness memory performance in general. In line with this notion, testing has been shown in some studies to be an effective means to reduce suggest- ibility, and the common explanation here is that testing boosts retention of the witnessed event, which in turn allows witnesses to reject subsequently presented misinformation (e.g., Pansky & Tenenboim, 2011). More surprisingly, however, is the fact that testing can sometimes produce the opposite effect – it can make witnesses far more susceptible to misinformation (e.g., Chan et al., 2009). The stark contrast of these ﬁndings raises the question of how to account for this empirical puzzle. In the present experiments, we found that a different misinformation presentation method can be a powerful driving force behind whether retrieval enhances or reduces suggestibility. Although the exact mechanisms that underlie these disparate results remain to be elucidated, we believe the present ﬁndings represent an important step toward a fuller understanding of the relationship between retrieval and eyewitness suggestibility.
