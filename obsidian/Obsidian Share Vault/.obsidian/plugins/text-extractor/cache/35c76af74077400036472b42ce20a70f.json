Ruiz UWIG Workshop on Variable Generation Forecasting Applications Tucson, AZ, February 8, 2012 Private and Confidential 1 Outline • Deterministic forecasts: always wrong! • Probabilistic forecasts: get it right! • Using probabilistic forecasts: higher reliability and lower costs! • Illustrative example on PSO: trading operations • Concluding remarks Private and Confidential 2 Deterministic Forecasts • Traditional forecasts provide a central tendency indication • Forecasts used in decision making as if they accurately represented individual future outcome realizations • Users don’t get the full value of the forecast Source: Jacques Duschesne, Wind power forecasting in Alberta, 2011 UWIG Forecasting Workshop Source: Jorge Ribot Vallejo, Wind generation forecasting system SIPREOLICO, 2011 UWIG Forecasting Workshop THE FORECAST IS ALWAYS WRONG!!! Private and Confidential 3 Deterministic Forecasts • Traditional forecasts provide a central tendency indication • Forecasts used in decision making as if they accurately represented individual future outcome realizations • Users don’t get the full value of the forecast Source: Jacques Duschesne, Wind power forecasting in Alberta, 2011 UWIG Forecasting Workshop Source: Jorge Ribot Vallejo, Wind generation forecasting system SIPREOLICO, 2011 UWIG Forecasting Workshop THE FORECAST IS ALWAYS WRONG!!! Private and Confidential 4 Probabilistic Forecasts • Available wind power is a dynamic, stochastic process • Multiple metrics must be used to describe it, continuously updated • Autocorrelations and cross correlations are critically important GET THE FORECAST (ALMOST) RIGHT MOST OF THE TIME!!! Source: Jacques Duschesne, Wind power forecasting in Alberta, 2011 UWIG Forecasting Workshop Private and Confidential 5 Probabilistic Forecast Information • Statistics: time-varying, updated – Expectations, moments – Percentile information: bounds for normal operations – Probability information: likelihood of complex events • Scenarios: focus on most important aspects – Random scenarios: lots of them! – Challenging conditions: reliable operations – Representative conditions: economic normal operations – Set of scenarios need to be consistent with the forecast statistics! Source: David Maggio, Using probabilistic information in real life, 2011 UWIG Forecasting Workshop Private and Confidential 6 Use of Probabilistic Forecasts • Adapt business processes and decision making approaches to fully utilize the information in the forecasts • More transparent and explicit management of uncertainty • Adaptive ancillary service requirements – Based on off-line studies – Dependent on system conditions • Multiple scenario/probabilistic approaches to economic dispatch, unit commitment and trading decisions – On line use of scenarios generated by probabilistic forecasts – Robust decisions GOAL: IMPROVE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY Private and Confidential 7 3-unit Illustrative Example Understand Optimal Bidding Strategies in Trading - 3 Cycle Decisions Day-Ahead: 12 hours prior to start of the day, 48-hour decision horizon (hourly for Day 1, bi-hourly for Day 2). Hour-Ahead: 30 mins prior to start of the hour, 2-hour decision horizon (eight 15 min periods). Real-Time (5-Min-Ahead Dispatch). - Only the Wind Forecast changes by Cycle. - Previous decisions will be honored and adjustments of generators made towards fulfilling previous decisions. Generators adjusted to fulfill Day-Ahead Sales commitment. Generators will be backed down to provide necessary reserves. Purpose Assumptions 3 Units (2 Gas, 1 Dispatchable Wind)  Marginal Cost. Wind < Gas 1 < Gas 2 Red < Blue < Brown (based on fuel cost and unit heat rates)  No ramp limit modeled by unit. 10 Min OR capability based on max capacity.  Start-up cost modeled by unit. $500 for gas.  Max/min gen modeled by unit. 300/150MW for gas. wind is dispatchable up to the forecast value. System Requirements  Regulation: None.  10 Min Operating Reserves: 50MW ramp up/down from online units within 10 mins for Day Ahead and Hour Ahead. Private and Confidential 8 3-unit Example: Deterministic Forecast and Realization Forecast Wind (1) Deviation from Forecast Wind (2) Forecast Wind (1) Realized Wind (3) (3) = (1) + (2) above Private and Confidential 9 3-unit Example: Perfect Foresight Deterministic Approach Day-Ahead Results (Financial commitment to sell in Day-Ahead Market) Anticipated Wind Gas 2 generation held back to secure 50MW of 10 Min OR. Total quantity sold Day-Ahead. Anticipated to be a price taker in the market ($60/MWh). Private and Confidential 10 3-unit Example: Forecast Uncertainty Forecast Wind (1) Sample deviations from Forecast Wind (2) Sample wind realizations Private and Confidential 11 Total quantity sold Day-Ahead 3-unit Example: Deterministic Monte Carlo Approach Scenarios: A B C Generation schedule varies by Scenario Dispatch with Forecast Monte Carlo Dispatches Private and Confidential 12 3-unit Example: Uncertainty Bound Scenarios Wind forecast uncertainty bounds to introduce caution in the dispatch solution Forecast Wind (1). Forecast Wind (1). Scenarios: High Forecasted Low Bound Deviation from Forecast Wind (2). Actual Realized Wind (3) (3) = (1) + (2). Private and Confidential 13 Total quantity sold Day-Ahead 3-unit Example: A Probabilistic Dispatch Approach Generation schedule varies by Scenario; Quantity sold Day- Ahead is the same Scenarios: Low Forecasted High Dispatch with Forecast Probabilistic Dispatch Private and Confidential 14 • Current use of forecasts is inconsistent with what forecasts are, and does not extract all the potential forecast value • Intelligent use of probabilistic forecast information can significantly improve market and system operations • Technology is ready for some applications – Dispatch and commitment of small systems – Market participant problems • Research questions remain – Market design – System size – Scenario selection – Ancillary service requirements Concluding Remarks Private and Confidential 15 Pablo A.
