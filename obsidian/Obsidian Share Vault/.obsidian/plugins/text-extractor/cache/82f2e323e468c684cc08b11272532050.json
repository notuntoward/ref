Commercial Energy Codes • IECC 2009 – Requires multi-level, dimming, or automatic shutoff control for most spaces • ASHRAE 90.1 – 2010 – Requires multi-level or dimming control for most spaces. No longer excepts spaces that have occupancy sensors – Requires automatic multi-level daylighting control for daylit zones, skylight zones> 900 ft2, and sidelight zones > 250 ft2 – Allows increases to the nominal W/ft2 if advanced controls that meet and exceed mandatory requirements are used Commercial Energy Codes • California Title 24 – 2008 – Requires multi-level or dimming control for spaces > 0.8 W/ft2 – Requires automatic multi-level daylighting control for daylit zones > 2,500 ft2 • California Title 24 – 2014 – Significant changes to certification, lighting alteration, and lighting controls requirements – Multi-level lighting control requirements no longer allow checkerboard/ alternate row switching; each luminaire must comply. – Multi-level lighting requirements vary by technology – LED luminaires, LED source systems, GU-24 sockets rated for LED require continuous dimming from 10%-100% Why phase-cut dimming is important for LEDs • Large U.S. installed base – NEMA estimates >150M – Mostly “analog” (no neutral) • Simplest retrofit – Replace light source (and maybe dimmer) – No new wires – No/minimal configuration or commissioning • Mature control technology – Widespread availability – Broadest manufacturer and product feature choices – Generally most cost- effective 91% 8% 1% Analog Digital ELV What’s working: Dimming today’s LEDs Shouldn’t this be easy?

So far, no evaluated MR16 LED replacement lamp can light the gallery without flicker or other poor performance.

Varying “extended” DALI standards may, however. DMX512 overview • One-way communication (RDM added feedback) • Originally developed by the US Institute of Theater Technology and released in 1988 for theatrical applications – specifically RGB light sources • Standardized as ANSI E1.11-2008 “DMX512-A - Asynchronous Serial Digital Data Transmission Standard for Controlling Lighting Equipment and Accessories” • Requires two low-voltage differential wires which carry a high speed signal, daisy-chained across one or more devices • Easy to assign individual control devices to one or many light sources without added wiring. • Available in wireless implementations as well (WDMX) DMX512 features and challenges Features – Serial data stream sent over a balanced cable system connected between a data transmitter and a data receiver. – Addressing of up to 512 channels per data link or “universe”, at data rates of up to 250 kbits/second – Systems typically consist of a one or more data transmitters (typically a lighting console) connected to a variety of data receivers Challenges – Requires unique wiring and wiring practices – Complex addressing and programming of multiple channels – Typically costly controls, luminaires, and wiring – Can create mixed-color white, but not well suited for general lighting Typical DMX512 system DMX data receivers • Dimmers, control gear • Mechanical color changers • Color changing light sources • Lasers, strobes • Smoke, confetti machines, other theatrical devices DMX512 Lighting Console PWM • Separate AC power and control signal • Analog one-way communication • Originally developed for linear fluorescent systems as part of IEC 60929 (Annex E) • Requires two low-voltage wires which carry a pulse-width encoded 1kHz signal • Impossible to assign individual control devices (dimmers, sensors) to one or many light sources without added wiring Switched Hot (power) PWM +/- AC Power Hot Neutral PWM features and challenges Features – Cost-effective control – Control zones can be run separate from power zones – Less sensitive to long wire runs Challenges – Typically requires line-voltage switching – Costly wiring requirements – Primarily adopted in Japan; rarely found elsewhere, so fewer equipment options Controlling current in simple (resistive) loads • Resistive loads have linear current-voltage relationships – I = (1/R) x V – For AC input, only care about Vrms – Time independency: Irms = (1/R) x Vrms • Resistive loads are bidirectional – Applying ±Vrms results in the same Irms – Irms = (1/R) x |Vrms| +Vrms +Vrms Irms Irms 0 25 50 75 100 0 1 2 3 4Irms Vrms Incandescent sources are simple (resistive) loads • Incandescent sources electrically behave like resistors (unlike pretty much every other lighting technology) • Incandescent sources effectively only care about Vrms – Constant R at steady state – R is a function of filament temperature • Incandescent sources are bidirectional – Applying ±Vrms results in the same Irms – Irms = (1/R) x |Vrms| • Important caveat: thermal persistence – If I(t>0)0 in resistor, no power consumption – If I(t>0)0 in incandescent source, light output continues as long as filament is hot (10s to 100s of milliseconds) +Vrms +Vrms Irms Irms Dimming incandescent sources • Inherently dimmable (don’t need to specify “dimmable”) • Compatible with all phase-cut dimmers • Dimmable to less than 1% on all phase-cut dimmers • Smooth dimming • Shift in color towards warmer white, lower CCT, reddish chromaticity as they dim • Thermal persistence of filament minimizes flicker Controlling incandescent light output Vrms = 120V Vrms = 120V Vrms = 120V Vrms = 120V Vrms = 120V Vrms = 60V 50% light output Same (average) light output High performance Inexpensive Vrms adjuster Determines dimming performance! Incandescent sources have similar dimming curves with different phase-cut dimmers Incandescent sources lose efficacy when dimmed Summary: Dimming in the old world • The majority of the dimmed lighting in the existing built environment consists of incandescent sources on phase- cut dimmers • The majority of phase-cut dimmers installed in the existing built environment were designed to dim incandescent light sources using forward phase-cut, TRIAC based circuitry • “Dimmable” means dims like an incandescent source • Dimming curves and other dimming performance features determined solely by dimmer design Controlling current in complex loads • Complex loads contain complex electronic devices (e.g. capacitors, inductors) • Complex loads contain devices which store energy • Complex loads contain devices with non-linear current-voltage relationships • Complex loads contain devices with time-dependencies (e.g. dv/dt, di/dt, on/off switching) Capacitors store energy in electric fields Inductors store energy in magnetic fields LEDs are complex loads • LEDs are non-linear devices – Different current-voltage relationships in different regions of operation – Small change in voltage can equal large change in current – (Average) current must (typically) be controlled • LEDs are unidirectional – (Forward) current only flows in one direction – Light output only for forward current • Important caveat: fast response – If I(t>0)0 in diode, no power consumption – If I(t>0)0 in LED, no light output – Careful attention to time where I≈0 +Vled>Vth +Vled>Vth Iled I≈0 VledIled Controlling LED light output Different (average) light output Controls current to LED Black Box High performance Inexpensive Vrms adjuster Determines dimming performance!

PWM or CCRDimming Old World New World Old world vs. new world of dimming • “Dimmable” typically doesn’t have to be specified – All incandescent sources are inherently dimmable • Dimming implies incandescent performance – All light sources turn on at same time/rate – Smooth and continuous dimming to 0.1% – Dim to warm extra text extra text • Dimming doesn’t cost extra • “Dimmable” must absolutely be specified – Some LED sources dim, some do not • Dimming performance is unclear or indeterminate – Some light sources may have a delayed start – Unknown dimming curve and range – Unknown or no CCT shift during dimming • Dimming adds cost to the solution If you remember nothing else … 1. The LED driver determines dimming performance – Dimming range (20%, 10%, 5% …) – Dimming curve (linear, logarithmic, measured, perceived …) – Dimming smoothness 2. LED driver compatibility with the dimming control determines to what degree it can deliver upon its designed performance – MANY technical issues affect performance, and must be addressed (by someone) – Systems with separate AC power and control signals minimize some, but not all issues Things to think about • What are your real, specific dimming requirements? • How much control do you have over the full design to commissioning cycle of the lighting systems in your projects? – System: light sources, transformers, controls, wiring – Design to commissioning cycle: architects, lighting designers, manufacturer services, electricians, contractors • How much do you rely on proven solutions, standards? • What kind of pre-specification testing can you (afford to) do? • You are going to have to learn new things; how far are you willing to go?

– dimmer position – energy consumption – measured light – perceived light Source: IESNA Lighting Handbook, 9th Edition 20% measured 45% perceived Demonstration: Dimming Range & Curves Technical details that affect phase-cut dimming performance of LED sources • Dimmer switching element characteristics • Dimmer standby current requirements • Dimmer timing element characteristics • Availability of neutral wire at the dimmer • LED source inrush current • LED source repetitive peak current • LED source input RMS current • Low-voltage system interface characteristics Signs of LED dimming problems • Flicker • Pop-on • Drop-out • Popcorn • Flashing • Ghosting • Poor dimming curves • Dead travel • Audible noise • Inoperability • Premature failure Dimming performance terminology • Flashing – Light source is intermittently on when it should be off • Ghosting – Light source is at a low-level on state when it should be off • Pop-on – Dimmer setting needs to be raised above low-end level in order to get light output at turn-on – Light should be able to turn-on at any dimmer setting • Drop-out – No light output at the bottom of the dimming range – The light should only turn off when the switch is turned off • Popcorn – Different turn-on times for different light sources on a dimmed circuit • Dead-travel – Adjusting the control without a corresponding change in light level Anatomy of a phase-cut dimmed LED system “Advanced features”  RFI Element  Timing Element  Switching Element Hot Dimmed Hot Neutral RFI Element  PFC Element  DC-DC Element  LEDs  Anatomy of a phase-cut dimmed LED system • RFI Element: minimizes and filters electrical “noise”, and (tries) to reduce current spikes • Switching Element: the power-handling device which controls current to the load • Timing Element: a circuit which determines when the Switching Element should turn on (and, in some cases, off) • Advanced Features: power supply circuits needed to allow operation of internal microcontrollers, radio receivers, occupancy sensors, etc. • PFC Element: Power Factor Correction • DC-DC Element: Circuit which regulates current to the LEDs Dimmer switching elements • Electronic switches – TRIAC (most common) – SCR • The “Gate” of an electronic switch controls whether the switch is open or closed • The Gate is actuated by an electronic signal • A specified minimum “holding” current through the switch is required to keep some electronic switches closed • What the #$&@! is a TRIAC anyway? “Gate” Switching Element Minimum TRIAC currentCurrent 30mA -30mA Incandescent LED TRIAC Minimum TRIAC dropout for LED load Switching Element TRIACs vs. SCRs • Conducts current in both directions, allowing a single device to handle AC operation • Single device can unintentionally latch into next half cycle – Sometimes a problem for LED loads • Single device typically fails bi- directionally (open or closed in both directions) – No potential to harm most loads • Conducts current in only one direction, so two are needed for AC operation • Device pair cannot unintentionally latch into next half cycle • Single SCR failure results in uni-directional device pair (open or closed in one direction only) – Will harm magnetic loads TRIAC: SCR: Switching Element Dimmer switching element issues • Switching element minimum holding current requirements contribute to “minimum load” requirements for dimmers • Most existing phase-cut dimmers require a minimum load of 25-40W • Timing circuit and “advanced features” current requirements can add to the minimum load (current) requirement Switching Element Dimmer standby current • Dimmers without neutral need to use LED source for return path to keep “advanced features” circuitry running • Most LED sources can not pass standby current required by dimmer “Advanced features”  Load DimmerHot Neutral Night Light Small current flow through load even when dimmer is “off” Dimmer standby current issues • LED source flashing – LED source gets/accepts enough current to start, but not maintain operation • LED source ghosting – LED source gets/accepts enough current to start, and maintain (low-level) operation • Dimmer inoperable or malfunctioning – LED source does not accept enough current to maintain proper operation of the dimmer control – Most problematic for advanced dimmers “Advanced features”  “Issue” or “feature”? “Advanced features”  Dimmer timing element • The timing element for phase-cut dimmers without neutral are designed to operate through the load, and expect “resistive” load characteristics • LED load input impedance characteristics are typically not resistive, and may change as it is dimmed. Timing Element  Load Dimmer Hot Neutral Timing Circuit Timing circuit in series with load Dimmer timing element issues • Timing element problems cause the switching element to turn on at the wrong time, aperiodically (not at consistent intervals), or both • Any change in the switching element behavior directly affects light output – Turning on or off at wrong time will raise or lower light level – Turning on or off aperiodically causes the light level to change from cycle to cycle, likely resulting in objectionable flicker Timing Element  Neutral benefits • Dimmers with neutral can direct current for “advanced features” to neutral, rather than through the LED source Requires neutral wire present in backbox! “Advanced features”  Load DimmerHot Neutral Night Light No current through load when dimmer is off Neutral benefits • Dimmers with neutral have a well-defined path for timing circuit current Timing Element  Requires neutral wire present in backbox!

Inrush Current Turn on Current Voltage I peak = 104A! LED load: 36W, 120Vrms, 0.3 Arms RFI Element  PFC  Phase-cut voltage Input Current LED source inrush current issues • Excessive wear on switch or relay contacts • Premature failure (welding) of switch or relay • Large chokes can be designed into dimmer to minimize inrush to dimmer, but may create issues of their own Relay contacts 120VAC, 16A 50k cycles Mechanical and electrical wear (high inrush) Primarily mechanical wear (no inrush) RFI Element  PFC  LED source repetitive peak current • Created by forward phase-cut, occurs every half-cycle • Relevant for forward-phase dimmers (only) • Commonly 5-10x Irms; can be much higher Repetitive Peak Current Dimmer at 50% light level LED Current Resistive Current Voltage 50% Conduction Angle Phase-cut voltage LED load: 15W, 120 Vrms, 0.13 Arms I peak = 3.75A RFI Element  PFC  LED load current LED source repetitive peak current issues • Varies significantly across LED products • Often major factor determining maximum dimmer loading • Major contributor to audible noise in light sources and controls • Major contributor to potentially reduced control lifetime RFI Element  PFC  LED source RMS input current Forward Phase Dimming Curve 0 mA 20 mA 40 mA 60 mA 80 mA 100 mA 120 mA 140 mA 160 mA 180 mA Maximum Minimum Dim m er PositionInput RMS Current Max Irms Forward phase dimming curve Incandescent dimming curve Irms may not immediately decrease as source is dimmed. 20%-50% increase is not uncommon Dimmer Position LED dimming curve RFI Element  PFC  LED source RMS input current issues • Higher current in control can cause excessive (unexpected) heating of components in control or LED source • Excessive heating can cause component stress and premature failure • At any dimmed level – If Irms has gone up more than Vrms has gone down … – Then Pave = Irms x Vrms can go up! RFI Element  PFC  Low-voltage system interfaces • Huge issue for very popular MR16 lamps • Two compatibility requirements – LED lamp/luminaire and step-down transformer – Step-down transformer and dimmer • Step-down transformer characteristics are often not known (and not locatable) for retrofits • Step-down transformer loading must sometimes be accounted for • Both magnetic and electronic transformers designed for LV systems were designed for resistive loads – Pairing MLV dimmer + magnetic transformer or ELV dimmer + electronic transformer no guarantee of success with LED loads Low-voltage system interface issues • Both dimmer and step-down transformer (ELV or MLV), may have loading requirements Minimum load requirements both here and here All step-down transformers are not equal Switched 120V input12V ELVTransformer 112V ELV Transformer212V MLV Transformer 50% Dimmed input 10% Dimmed input Imbalance may be perceived as “shimmer” in light output Nitty-Gritty summary • The LED driver determines dimming performance • LED driver compatibility with the dimming control determines to what degree it can deliver its designed performance – System variations can lead to performance variations – Actual dimming performance can only be determined by looking at the potential compatibility issues in the system • Try to identify and separate issues that… – You have some control or influence over, and can address – You have little or no control over, or cannot address Recommended practices for dimming today’s LEDs Dimming LEDs is possible, today • Terminology • Questions to ask • Latest products – Power electronics IC – Driver – Dimmer • Mock-ups • LED source, by design – dimmability – control type – control guidance • Control loading • Get help making matches • Have backup options Learn new things Do your homework Selecting the right (or best) control 1. Is the LED product a lamp or luminaire? – Lamp • Typically retrofit, standard base • Integral, non-replaceable driver • Constrained to phase control – Luminaire • Often has driver options • Driver options yield control options: (e.g. phase control, 0-10V, DALI, proprietary) 2. What is the designed, claimed, (i.e. best-case) dimming performance of the LED product? – Dimming range (20%, 10%, 5% …) – Dimming curve (linear, logarithmic, measured, perceived …) – Dimming smoothness Selecting the right (or best) control 3. Was the LED product designed for a specific type of control signal? – Many different dimming methods (forward, reverse phase, 0- 10V, etc) – Very little (true) standardization 4. Does the LED product offer any control selection guidance? – Recommended dimmer list? If so, use it! – Control type? i.e. forward, reverse phase? – Dimmer loading? i.e. max/min number of sources per control? – Beware expectations of exactly the same results from any/all guidance – Will they ensure performance claims are met? Dimmer loading re-cap • Minimum load – LED loads can not draw enough current to keep dimmer switching element(s) closed, leading to erratic behavior – LED loads can create series impedances which disrupt dimmer timing element(s), leading to erratic behavior – LED loads in off state may not pass dimmer current in a manner which keeps dimmer advanced features functioning while remaining in off state • Maximum load – LED loads can create stresses on dimmers above and beyond what their rated (incandescent) wattage indicates, leading to reduced dimmer lifetime Dimmer loading rules have changed • Minimum load varies by dimmer • Maximum load varies by dimmer and LED source Dimmer Source Possible loading 600W incandescent 60W incandescent 1-10 600W incandescent 12W LED 1-50? 600W ELV 50W halogen 1-12 600W ELV 10W LED 1-60? 3-10 2-30 Dimmer ratings 2 load ratings!

Mock it up • All sources • All combinations • Full circuits • Especially if maintaining ANY existing equipment • Best risk mitigation Demonstration: Mock-UpFixing dimming problems • Often there are no good solutions once products are installed • Common “fixes” – Change the LED source (ouch!) – Use a different driver (if possible?) – Use a different control (different performance?) – Add incandescent or dummy load (efficiency loss?) – Add additional wires and/or interface devices (costly!) • Who is responsible? Who pays? • Compatibility must be determined BEFORE products are ordered and installed!
