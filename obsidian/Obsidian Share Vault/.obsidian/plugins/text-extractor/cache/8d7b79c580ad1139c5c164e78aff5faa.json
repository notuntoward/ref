Minute ventilation, the product of respiratory rate and tidal volume, correlates directJy with oxygen consumption, cardiac output, and heart rate. An impJantable pacemaker has been developed which allows variation in pacing rate in response to measured changes in minute ventilation. This single ciiamber system measures transthoracic impedance between the tip electrode of a standard bipoiar lead and the pulse generator case. Low ampli- tude current pulses fl mA for 15 fisec) are generated each 50 msec between the ring electrode and the case. In the adaptive mode, the pulse generator calcuiates a rate response factor or slope after maximal exercise. This slope, which describes the relationship between pacing rate and minute ventilation together with the pacing rate limits are the only programmabJe rate responsive features. Minute ventilation rate responsive systems have been impianted in 12 patients (8/emaJes, 4 males], of mean age 63 years. Indications were His bundie ablation (6), acquired compiete heart biock (4), and sick sinus syndrome (2). At post-implant exercise testing, pacing rate rose witiiin tiie first minute. Peak rate and time to upper rate were dependent on woricioad. After exercise, pacing rate remained at peak for up to 2 minutes before a gradual fall to resting rate. Comparative studies of the minute ventilation and the activity sensor pacing systems in the same patients confirmed that the minute ventilation system more closely parallels normal sinus response to activity. The minute ventiiation rate responsive pacing system is simple to programme, no special lead is required and the system is highly physiologic.

The use of respiratory rate alone as a variable for a sensor driven rate responsive system is limited particularly at low workloads.'\"^ Nappholz et al.^ initially evaluated transthoracic impedance measurements using an intravenous quadripolar catheter positioned in the superior vena cava. A linear relationship was found hetween tidal volume and the measured electrical impedance with correlation coefficients between 0.94 and 0.98. The impedance signal also showed inflections corresponding to changes in breath direction allowing measurement of respi- ratory rate. From these measurements, changes in minute ventilation were derived. Subsequent re- finement of the Nappholz system has allowed the development of a minute ventilation sensor using 1866 November 1988, Part II PACE. Vol. 11 MINUTE VENTILATION, RATE RESPONSIVE PACING a standard bipolar pacemaker lead, without a need for a special auxiliary sensor. Minute Ventilation Rate Responsive Pacing System The Telectronics META MV^\" (metabolic, minute ventilation) Model 1202 (Telectronics Pty. Ltd., Sydney. Australia] utilizes changes in min- ute ventilation as the sensed variable for adjust- ing pacing rate. The single chamber bipolar pace- maker is multiprogrammable and suitable for both atrial and ventricular use. In addition to the rate responsive and non-rate responsive VVI or AAI modes, an adaptive mode is used for deter- mining the rate response factor. The adaptive mode provides non-rate responsive VVI or AAI pacing together with a minute ventilation sensing function. Thus, although analysis of changes in minute ventilation by the sensor takes place, there is no rate responsive pacing in this mode. To obviate the need for a special lead, a tri- polar system was developed using a standard bi- polar lead and the pulse generator casing. The algorithm was obtained from the pooled data of 200 animal and human studies. Comparison with sinus rhythm yielded a correlation of 0.85 and the time delay in rate response was 45 sec.^ A low energy pulse (1 mA for 15 Aisec at 20 Hz) for mea- surement of the transthoracic impedance is gen- erated between the ring electrode of the lead and the pulse generator case. The pulse is less than 10% of the threshold energy required for ventric- ular capture and well below the levels which could induce dangerous ventricular arrhythmias. Measurement of impedance is performed be- tween the tip electrode of the lead and the pulse generator casing each 50 msec (Fig. 1). Transthoracic impedance increases with in- spiration, decreases with expiration, and its am- plitude varies with the tidal volume. The imped- ance signal thus comprises two components rep- resenting tidal volume and respiratory rate. The pulse generator circuitry identifies the two signals and processes them to derive minute ventilation. Two signal averaging processes operate within the pulse generator; one with a short time con- stant of about 30 sec which allows for smooth rate changes and the other with a long time constant of approximately 1 to 2 hours. The difference be- Pace Sense Figure 1. Diagram of the minute ventiiation transtho- racic impedance sensing system. A standard bipolar lead lies at the apex of the right ventricle. Low energy puJses are generated at (he ring electrode and measure- ment o/transthoracic impedance occurs between the tip electrode and the pulse generator casing. tween these two signal averages is used to moni- tor the changes in minute ventilation which is continually updated. During prolonged exercise, the value of the long time constant could \"catch up\" to the short time constant and inappropri- ately reduce the pacing rate. To prevent this, the long-term data collection is frozen when the short-term value reaches 50% of the maximum impedance change. When the value falls below this threshold, both registers resume data process- ing. The relationship between the two time con- stants allows the short-time constant to maintain the upper rate limit during extended exercise and also allows for rapid and maximal exercise changes if exercise is recommenced after a short rest. Programming the Rate Responsive Function Programming the minute ventilation rate re- sponsive system is simple and requires a single exercise test. Apart from the upper and lower pacing rates, only one other function requires pro- gramming and this is automatically calculated by PACE, Vol. 11 November 1988, Part II 1867 MOND, ET AL. the pulse generator. This is the rate response fac- tor or \"slope\" which determines the change in pacing rate in response to changes in minute ven- tilation. Fifty-nine slope values are available. The higher slope values produce marked changes in pacing rate for only a small change in minute ventilation whereas lower slope settings require large changes in minute ventilation to produce small changes in pacing rate (Fig. 2). The optimal slope value can be determined for each patient: this is called the peak exercise function. Following pacemaker implantation, the pulse generator is programmed to the adaptive mode and the patient is asked to rest for at least 1 hour prior to exercise testing. In this mode, the rate responsive sensing circuit adapts to the pa- tient's individual respiratory impedance charac- teristics. After an hour, with the pulse generator still in the adaptive mode, a near maximal exer- cise test is performed. The suggested optimal slope value based on the patient's respiratory characteristics during exercise is then calculated hy the implanted pulse generator and program- mer and displayed by the programmer. This is a recommended slope value only and the physician may choose a slope value on either side of this, each level representing a change of about 10%. The algorithm will respond to respiratory rates between 3 and 60 breaths per minute and to changes of 50% in minute ventilation within 35 seconds. At the time of slope programming, the minimum or low rate (50-150 beats per minute) and maximum or upper rate (80-165 beats per minute) must be set as well. If the slope value, minimum heart rate, and maximum heart rate are not entered when the minute ventilation rate responsive mode is programmed, nominal values are chosen automatically (minimum rate; 70 beats per minute, maximum rate, 100 beats per minute; slope, 11). The simplicity of the system is such that once the three functions have been pro- grammed, no further adjustments should be nec- essary. In both the adaptive and the rate respon- sive modes, the signals used to measure transtho- META MV COMPARISON OF RATE RESPONSE FACTORS MIN.RATE 70. MAX.

Results Twelve ventricular minute ventilation rate responsive pacing systems have been implanted in suitable recipients over a 6-month period from October, 1987. There were eight females and four males with the mean age being 63 years (range 45-85). The indications for pacing were His bun- dle ablation in six patients (atrial fibrillation, three; AV node reentry tachycardia, three), ac- quired complete heart block, four, and sick sinus syndrome, two. The implantation procedure was routine with the cephalic vein being used in all cases. Standard bipolar Telectronics model 284 leads were used in seven cases and Medtronic model 4012 or steroid-loaded model 5026 leads in the remaining five. There were no operative complications. The only postoperative complication was an exit block probably due to lead perforation of the right ven- tricle. The lead required remanipulation 4 months post-implantation. Following implantation, the patients were divided into two groups. The objective was to allow 3 months in either the non-rate responsive mode or 3 months in the rate responsive mode, conduct respiratory and exercise testing and then program to the opposite mode for an additional 3 months when the studies were to be repeated. Seven of the patients were left in the non-rate responsive mode rate 70. Two of these patients presented within 4 weeks of implantation with shortness of breath or poor exercise tolerance and were exercised and programmed to the rate re- sponsive mode. In both patients, there was an al- most immediate subjective improvement in exer- cise tolerance and well being. Five of the patients were exercised and programmed to the rate re- sponsive mode. The studies have not been com- pleted. PACE, Vol. 11 November 1988, Part II 1869 MOND, ET AL. Treadmill testing in the minute ventilation rate responsive mode has demonstrated an excel- lent physiologic response to exercise. As demon- strated in Figure 4 the early rate response to ex- ercise is rapid and the rise to the peak rate is dependent on the amount and length of exercise or work load. High pacing rates are maintained until the cessation of exercise, then for a further period of at least 1 minute following it. Figure 4 also demonstrates the difference in exercise times in one patient while in the non-rate responsive mode and subsequently in the rate responsive mode. The patient had chronic rapid atrial fibril- lation refractory to all medications and elected to have His bundle ablation. Following ablation, the patient occasionally increased his heart rate to 80 beats per minute, thus overriding his pacemaker in the non-rate re- sponsive mode. There was, however, a marked improvement in exercise time in the minute ven- tilation rate responsive mode and the patient re- fused to remain in the non-rate responsive mode because of marked symptoms with exercise. Figure 5 demonstrates the close correlation hetween measured minute ventilation and the cardiac pacing rate during both exercise and re- covery. Following cessation of exercise, the pa- tient continued to hyperventilate and the pacing rate rose to the programmed upper rate. The ac- tual correlation coefficients in this case demon- stration are shown in Figure 6. During exercise, the r value was 0.84 but during rest it rose to 0.89 confirming the success of the sensor and the pre- pared algorithm. The 24-hour mean heart rate from the ambulatory monitoring is demonstrated in Figure 7. During exercise testing, the patient demonstrated angina at a pacing rate of 130 beats per minute and consequently an upper rate of 120 beats per minute was chosen. The suggested slope of 22 was not programmed but rather a lower slope of 17 in order to prevent rapid pacing rate changes with exertion. The ambulatory monitor- ing showed rises in pacing rate from 70 to 100 beats per minute throughout the day. The patient did not experience angina during the 24-hour pe- riod. In Figure 8, the pacing rate response to in- creasing workload is again shown.

See text for detaiJs. minute ventilation rate responsive system is compared with the activity rate responsive sys- tem (Activitrax™, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) with the studies being performed simuitaneously. The activity puise generator was tightly strapped to the chest wall and the activity settings of low activity threshold and a rate response of 7 were programmed. Using the external pulse generator, these settings appear to correspond to the widely used implanted settings of medium activity threshold and rate response 7. A marked differ- ence between the two rate responsive systems was seen. At the commencement of exercise, the activity rate responsive system increased its rate to near 120 pulses per minute within the first minute despite the low workload. This is because the activity sensor has an all or none response heing dependent on vibration and not workload. With increasing workload, the pacing rate of the activity rate responsive system actually fell before it reached another peak at about 130 beats per minute, far below the set upper rate of 150 beats per minute. Upon cessation of exercise, the rate response fell to the low rate within the first min- ute. In contrast, the minute ventilation rate re- sponsive system increased its pacing rate accord- ing to the physiologic workload and in view of the initial programming exercise test was able to reach the upper rate limit of 150 bpm at peak exercise. The maximum rate response is main- tained following cessation of exercise for about 2 minutes before a rapid return to the programmed minimum rate. Discussion The advent of rate responsive cardiac pacing has been the most dramatic pacing event of the 1980s. Currently, only the activity rate responsive system is widely availahle on the international market with the respiratory rate and QT interval rate responsive systems limited to Europe and some centers in Asia.

A standard Bruce protocol was then performed, See text /or details. tricular dP/dt, minute ventilation and ventricu- lar depolarization gradient, have been incorpo- rated into rate responsive pacing systems and are undergoing clinical evaluation with limited inter- national clinical availability. Of all the sensor based pacemakers, only minute ventilation stands out as a highly physiological system which appro- priately alters the atrial or ventricular pacing rate in response to a given workload in patients with and without heart disease. The system is ex- tremely simple to program while the exercise test in the adaptive mode allows the system to cater to individual patient requirements and helps achieve the upper pacing rate at peak exercise. The comparative studies performed at the same time in the same patients between the min- ute ventilation and activity rate responsive sys- tem highlight the superiority of the minute venti- lation sensor in rate responsive pacing. Both sys- tems have a rapid response time, but activity cannot discriminate between different work- loads^ at most usual settings, and the upper rate cannot be achieved at any level of exercise. The rapid fall in pacing rate at the end of exercise is also a disadvantage of the activity rate responsive system. This feature hopefully will be overcome in future models. Theoretically, the minute ventilation rate re- sponsive system appears superior to the central venous temperature rate responsive system. The central venous temperature sensor requires a spe- cial pacing lead and is slow to respond to exercise, particularly at low workloads.^ To some extent, this can be overcome by the algorithm, although this makes the system cumbersome and difficult to program. The central venous temperature rate responsive system also appears to have limita- tions in patients with advanced heart disease. The QT interval or ventricular endocardial paced evoked response uses a standard unipolar pacing lead but not all leads provide suitable en- docardial T wave sensing.'\" The response time of the system is slow^' and repeated exercise testing, ambulatory monitoring and reprogramming are frequently necessary for the desired physiological response.'^ The system requires ventricular pac- ing for QT measurements and at this time cannot be used in the atrium. The alterations in QT in- PACE, Vol. 11 November 1988, Part II 1873 MOND, ET AL. terval by drugs, myocardial infarction and otber pathological situations have limited the use of this system. The respiratory rate responsive system has had a very limited use mainly in Europe. This is due to the need for a special auxiliary sensor lead which has had a number of reported problems including nonsensing, fracture, migration, and skin erosion.^•^^•''' The minute ventilation system correlates more closely with changes in heart rate than does respiratory rate alone, particularly at low workloads.'\"^ Very limited information is available on the ventricular depolarization gradient and right ven- tricular dP/dt sensor based pacing systems. Tbe ventricular depolarization gradient rate respon- sive system is very attractive as a standard pacing lead can be used and the system is essentially closed loop, obviating tbe need for complex pro- gramming. Like the QT interval rate responsive system, pacing is necessary for the rate response. The right ventricular dP/dt rate responsive sys- tem is limited by a special lead. The rate response of both these systems in the presence of heart disease is still unknown. In conclusion, early experience with the minute ventilation rate responsive system has demonstrated that the use of minute ventilation to drive a rate responsive pacemaker is highly physiological. No special implantation technique is required and the system is easy to program. There have been no significant system defects demonstrated and no contraindications to this type of pacing in patients requiring rate respon- sive pacing systems.
