The reserve required to accommodate the net load forecast error is estimated using a probabilistic criterion based on the expected load not served. The net load is deﬁned as the total system demand minus the wind generation. The proposed reserve determination model is specially tailored to the Danish pool market organization, which comprises several power and energy trading arenas sequentially arranged from one day ahead to real time. The uncertainty associated with the system load and wind production is dealt with by means of the multivariate treatment of the forecast errors. Speciﬁcally, the cross-correlogram of load and wind power forecast errors is analyzed with a view to identifying a structure easily exploitable. 2 Market Organization We assume a sequentially arranged market organization for short-term energy and reserve transactions that comprises the following two basic trading ﬂoors: 1. An availability market where generators commit themselves to place a bid fore a certain volume at the regulation market for a compensation. This way future availability of reserves can be ensured. 2. Energy market, in which the production schedule of every unit in the system is deter- mined. 3. Reserve market, cleared after the previous one and close to the actual power delivery. In this market, enough reserve from market agents is guaranteed to absorb power system uncertainties. The reserve determination model proposed in this report is aimed to provide either the availability market or the reserve market, or both, with the downward- and upward-reserve needs to be covered through such markets. Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate diﬀerent alternatives for the reserve and energy scheduling. Note that RDM in these ﬁgures stands for ”Reserve Determination Model”. If an availability market is included in the market organization, the reserve determination model is to be run twice (see Fig. 2): 4 Energy market RDM Reserve market R U’, R D’ Availability market Production schedule RDM R U, R D Figure 2: Sequential arrangement of the energy and reserve trading including an availability market 1. First, prior to the clearing of the availability market. In this case, the reserve deter- mination model yields the reserve needs, RU and RD, to be satisﬁed by means of this market. Moreover, in this stage, the reserve determination model should account for an estimation of the costs derived from the production schedule that results from the subsequent energy market. 2. Second, before the clearing of the reserve market. The reserve needs are reassessed based on the production schedule resulting from the energy market and the update of the uncertainty modeling. It is important to note that since the uncertainty associated with the forecast errors diminish as the forecasting horizon decreases, the reserve requirements computed in the previous step are expected to be more conservative than the reserve needs provided by the RDM in this second phase. 3 Formulation The reserve determination model is an adjusted version of the model presentet in [3] and is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem with an objective function as Minimize R U,R D,P S i ,ui,pi(m),Sω,Lshed ω EC = RÛgU ( RU) + RD̂gD ( RD) + NΩ∑ ω=1 πw [ uiP min i ≤ P S i ≤ uiP max i , ∀i (4) uiP min i ≤ P S i + rU iω − rD iω ≤ uiP max i , ∀i, ∀ω (5) NG∑ i=1 (P S i + rU iω − rD iω) + ̂P W + θW ω − Sω = ̂L − Lshed ω + θL ω, ∀ω (6) NG∑ i=1 P S i + ̂P W = ̂L, (7) 0 ≤ Lshed ω ≤ ̂L + θL ω, ∀ω (8) 0 ≤ Sω ≤ ̂P W + θW ω , ∀ω (9) 0 ≤ rU iω ≤ uiτ RUP i , ∀i, ∀ω (10) 0 ≤ rD iω ≤ uiτ RDN i , ∀i, ∀ω (11) NG∑ i=1 rU iω ≤ RU, ∀ω (12) NG∑ i=1 rD iω ≤ RD, ∀ω (13) ui ∈ {0, 1}, ∀i. (14) The optimization problem (1)–(13) constitutes the mathematical implementation of a single-period security-constrained market-clearing model based on a single-node represen- tation of the power network. The objective function (1) is the expected cost of the power system operation, which is made up of the following terms: • The estimated allocation costs of the up- and down- reserves, ̂gU(·) and ̂gD(·) respec- tively • The estimated costs of the up- and down-reserve requirements, ̂f U(·) and ̂f D(·), re- spectively. • The expected cost of the production schedule, ∑NG i=1 λGi(m)pi(m), and • the cost of the expected load not served, ∑NΩ ω=1 πwV LOLLshed ω . Observe that the reserve determination model (1)–(13) does not deal with the problem of how to allocate reserves to market agents in an optimal fashion. This problem is assumed to be naturally settled later by the market. In addition, the proposed model for reserve determination assumes that estimates of the marginal cost functions of generating units are available. These marginal cost functions, which are modeled by factors λGi(m), are needed to account for the priority order in which productions units will be committed and dispatched in the energy market, thus stating a criterion to diﬀerentiate the reserve service from the energy product. In this respect, if the RDM were to be run after the clearing of the energy market, the production schedule would be then known and thus, introduced into the RDM as input data. Consequently, the term∑NG i=1 λGi(m)pi(m) could be removed from the objective function (1) as it would have no impact on the optimization problem solution. Constraints (2) and (3) model unit cost functions by piece-wise linear approximations. Constraints (4) and (5) enforce the generation capacity limits of the production units. Con- straint (6) constitutes the single-node power balance equation, which is contingent on the 6 wind power and load forecasts, ̂P W and ̂L, and their associated errors, θW ω and θL ω, respec- tively The modeling and inclusion of the multivariate relationship between the forecast errors θW ω and θL ω is not addressed in this ﬁrst formulation of the problem. The inclusion of this relationship is nevertheless a key issue and should be incorporated in the problem in later iterations. In principle, the multivariate analysis to be carried out will focus on the linear dependencies (cross-correlations) existing between both stochastic processes. These dependencies are expected to arise from both the reciprocal eﬀect of load and wind and the forecast assembling process itself. The inclusion of constraint (7) into the optimization problem is motivated by current market practices, according to which reserve services are exclusively aimed to accommodate unpredictable disturbances such as net load forecast errors or unexpected equipment fail- ures. If reserves are allowed to be deployed under purely economic criteria, the predicted wind power in this constraint, ̂P W, should be replaced by a slack variable, which could be interpreted as the scheduled wind power production. Constraints (8) and (9) impose natural limits on the amount of load that can be involuntarily curtailed and on the amount of wind power production that can be wasted, respectively. Constraints (10) and (11) enforce ramp limits of units and therefore, restrict reserve providers to those generators capable of un- dertaking ramp excursions for reserve deployment within a time frame τ . Constraints (12) and (13) establish the reserve needs as the upper bounds of the summation of the reserve deployment actions. Lastly, constraints (14) declare the commitment status variables ui as binary. 4 Functions for the Reserve Costs In the following, the reserve cost functions ̂gU(·), ̂gD(·), ̂f U(·) and ̂f D(·) are elaborated on. Since the functions are intended to enter the objective function and not to directly forecast the regulation costs as such, they have to have some speciﬁc properties in addition to reﬂect the costs well. Below the main properties these function should exhibit are listed: 1. Function ̂f U(·) should be monotonically increasing and positive because: (a) This is a condition imposed by the rules governing the reserve market and the reserve oﬀering submission process in this market. (b) Deploying up reserve translates into increasing operation costs due to fuel con- sumption, startups, equipment wear, etc. 2. Function ̂f D(·) should be monotonically increasing and mainly negative (except for cases with negative electricity prices) because: (a) Deploying down reserve translates into decreasing production levels, thus reducing fuel costs, to increase, for example, the contribution of wind generation to the energy supply. (b) The regulation down costs stem then from the fact that, by default, the required decrease in the power output of production units would give more money back to the system if performed in the energy market (forward market) than if managed through the reserve market (closer to real-time). This fact should be taken into account when estimating the reserve cost function ̂f D(·). Speciﬁcally, the function estimate should be likely conditional upon the energy market price in the form of a constraint stating that the down-regulation price should be smaller than or equal to the energy market price. 7 3. Function ̂gD(·) and ̂gU(·) should be monotonically increasing since the allocation of reserves does under all circumstances imply additional operational cost. 4.1 Modeling ̂f U(·) & ̂f D(·) The functions ̂f U(·) and f D should describe the cost of reserve deployment as a function of the deployed volume. Hence, since the reserves are deployed in real-time through the regulation market, the associated cost is indeed the regulation price for the corresponding direction. Constructing ̂f U(·) and ̂f D(·) thus translates to model the up- and the down- regulation price as a function of the deployed volume. In the short run, the regulation price in a given hour is of course heavily dependent on which generators are active on the regulation market which in turn is, to a great extent, determined by the produced wind power and the consumption during that same hour[2]. This aside, the fact that the up- and down-regulation prices by deﬁnition never deceed or exceed the spot prices respectively makes the spot prices inﬂuential as well. It therefore seems as an appealing idea to model ̂f U(·) and ̂f D(·) conditioned upon these factors. Doing so while still maintaining the properties listed before is however a non-trivial task which takes a considerable eﬀort to solve. It was therefore decided to settle for a simpler unconditional model for the time being and leave the construction of a conditional model for the functions as a future task. The construction of such model is nevertheless elaborated on towards the end of this note. It seems reasonable to assume that ̂f U(·) and ̂f D(·) are non-linear and dependent on the time of the day. Thus a model on the form f (X) = α1X α2 + α3 (15) is proposed for each hour of the day where the α’s are parameters to be estimated. The appeal of this model structure is ﬁrst and far most that it allows for some non-linearity while monotonicity is guarantied. The regulation prices are plotted against the regulated volume hour-by-hour in Figures 3 & 4. In the same ﬁgures, an hour speciﬁc model is plotted in red. The parameters in the models (15) are estimated by a least squares criteria using data for the DK-1 grid area in Denmark during 2008 and 2009. The estimated parameters can be seen in Table 2 in Appendix. Generally it seems as the models capture the average price conditioned upon the volume quite well as the residual RM SE is signiﬁcantly lower than that of the price series as can be seen in Table 1. Whereas the quality of the model is suﬃcient for the purposes of this note, it is clear that it will take more eﬀort to derive a model that would be applicable in practice. Interestingly, there seem to be two alternating patterns in during the peak consumption hours for the up regulation prices and during the night for the down regulation prices. As will be elaborated on further towards the end of this note, our hypothesis is that this can to some degree be explained by the interaction between wind power and the rest of the system.

As for the down regulation reserves goes, allocation is extremely rare which leaves us with only few useful observations for each hour. The few data points of use however suggest that there is some relationship between the volume and the compensation. On the other hand, Figure 6 reveals that there is very weak relation between the allocated up regulation reserves and the compensation paid – At least unconditionally. Prompted by these observations it is decided to represent ̂gU(·) and ̂gD(·) by a constant for which will be varied in the optimization. 9010002000Hour: 1 0 200 400 600 800 Hour: 2 Hour: 3 0 200 400 600 800 Hour: 4 Hour: 5 Hour: 6 Hour: 7010002000Hour: 8010002000Hour: 9 Hour: 10 Hour: 11 Hour: 12 Hour: 13 Hour: 14 Hour: 15010002000Hour: 16010002000Hour: 17 Hour: 18 Hour: 19 Hour: 20 0 200 400 600 800 Hour: 21 Hour: 22 0 200 400 600 800 Hour: 23010002000Hour: 24Up Regulation Cost Regulated Volume Up Regulation Cost vs. Volume Figure 4: Up regulation prices against volume hour-by-hour 5 Simulations Results 5.1 Model Setup Simulations determining the reserve need for a single hour where individual components of the model are speciﬁed/varied as follows: The parameters of ̂f U(·) and ̂f D(·) are set to be those estimated for the 11th hour of the day.

Scenarios of forecast- ing errors are simulated using 9 diﬀerent correlation coeﬃcients ρ ∈ [−0.2, −0.1, . . . , 0.6]. For each value of ρ, 40 independent sets of 100 scenarios are used where each set is derived by reducing 10000 scenarios using the technique described in [4]. The initial 10000 scenarios are simply drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with the ap- propriate Variance-Covariance matrix. For simulations with ﬁxed correlation, ρ = 0.2 is used. Technical speciﬁcations of the generation units like marginal costs, ramp rates etc. are obtained from the IEEE test system [6] 11 Allocated VolumeCompensation 0 200 400 600 0 100 200 300 Hour: 19 Hour: 20 0 100 200 300 Hour: 21 Hour: 22 0 100 200 300 Hour: 23 Hour: 24 Hour: 13 Hour: 14 Hour: 15 Hour: 16 Hour: 17 0 200 400 600 Hour: 18 0 200 400 600 Hour: 7 Hour: 8 Hour: 9 Hour: 10 Hour: 11 Hour: 12 Hour: 1 0 100 200 300 Hour: 2 Hour: 3 0 100 200 300 Hour: 4 Hour: 5 0 100 200 300 0 200 400 600 Hour: 6 Figure 6: Allocation costs against allocated up regulation reserves hour-by-hour The value of lost load is varied between V LOL = 10β, β ∈ [1, . . . , 10] . For simulations where V LOL is ﬁxed, V LOL = 10000$/M W h is used. The currency used in the IEEE system is US dollars while the regulation functions are mod- eled in Danish krona. In order to obtain some sort of compatibility between the currencies, DKKs are converted to USD at a ﬁxed rate of 5.5 DKK/USD. Obviously the system here described does not compare to a real-life system in complexity and non-linearity. However as the purpose of the simulations is merely to demonstrate the conceptual applicability of the model, rather than inferring on the result obtained, the simpliﬁcations should be in order. 5.2 Numerical Results Simulations are made as if the none of the markets have been cleared thus yielding reserve variables, RU & RD, that indicate how much reserves should be allocated given the allocation compensation. The simulations are made such that three out of four of the variables that are to be inspected are kept ﬁxed while the remaining one is varied. Then the results are summarized by plotting the obtained expectancies for 1) the operation cost of the system, 2) the spillage of wind power, 3) the lost load, 4) the allocated down regulation reserves and 5) the allocated up regulation reserves. The 40 simulations made for each value of each variable are used to construct quantile conﬁdence bands which have a nominal probability coverage indicated in the legend. 12 −0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6270002800029000300003100032000 ρExpected Cost 100 % 60 % 20 % Figure 7: Expected cost of the system for diﬀerent ρ’s. At ﬁrst simulations are made for diﬀerent correlation between the forecasting errors of wind and load while all other variables are kept ﬁxed at their default values. In Figures 7 - 8 the expected system operation cost and the expected wind spillage are plotted respectively. Both quantities seem to be reduced by increased ρ and whereas the variability of the wind spillage is almost constant, the variability of the cost generally decreases along with the mean. Both behavior are as to be expected since the more positive correlation between the error there is, the more of the reserve need is taken care of automatically by the system. The linear reduction in the two measures mainly explained by the assumption of Gaussianity of the residual and is therefore probably not realistic. These simple and unrealistic scenarios could however be substituted by more realistic ones, accounting for both linear and non- linear components of the serial- and cross-correlation of the series, without having to alter the model structure. Uninterestingly, the expected lost load was 0 for all but one out of the 40 · 100 · 9 simulations made. Only in one instance for ρ = −0.1 a non-zero expected loss of load was obtained or E [ Lshed ω ] = 0.14. For this reason a plot for the expected loss of load is omitted. The allocated down- and up-regulation reserves for diﬀerent ρ’s are shown in Figures 9 & 10 respectively. Whereas the allocation of down regulation reserves seems to be almost entirely dependent on the set of error scenarios, there seems to be a decreasing tendency in the allo- cated up regulation reserves for the aforementioned reasons. Again it should be emphasized that nothing should be read out of the fact that the decrease appears as a linear one. 13 −0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.610152025 ρExpected Spill 100 % 60 % 20 % Figure 8: Expected spillage of wind power in the system for diﬀerent ρ’s. −0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6100120140160180200220 ρReserve Down 100 % 60 % 20 % Figure 9: Required down regulation reserves for diﬀerent ρ’s 14 −0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6300350400450500 ρReserve Up 100 % 60 % 20 % Figure 10: Required up regulation reserves for diﬀerent ρ’s 15 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 3529000300003100032000330003400035000 Availability Compensation − DownExpected Cost 100 % 60 % 20 % Figure 11: Expected cost of the system against diﬀerent allocation costs for down regulation reserves Next the value of ̂gD(·) is varied as speciﬁed earlier in this section. The same quantities are plotted as before and in the same order in Figures 11 - 13. Here, even less variability in the expected lost load is observed as it never surpassed 0. According to expectations, higher compensation yields higher expected operation cost along with a marginal increase in the variability between scenario sets. Meanwhile, the expected spillage of wind power is constant for almost all compensations tried. Only for the 4 lowest compensation values, less wind is expected to be spilled, on average. And even for these 4 values, the diﬀerence is very small. The reason for this lack of variability is to be found in the same for the allocated down regulation reserves. That in turn is a result of that only for a very low compensation, the model is willing to allocate reserves instead of spilling wind. Thus when the compensation is suﬃciently high, we run the risk of having to spill all the extra wind power. Naturally, the amount of up regulation reserves depends entirely upon the set of scenarios as the compensation is constant. 16 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 351520253035 Availability Compensation − DownExpected Spill 100 % 60 % 20 % Figure 12: Expected spillage of wind power in the system against diﬀerent allocation costs for down regulation reserves 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 356080100120140 Availability Compensation − DownReserve Down 100 % 60 % 20 % Figure 13: Required down regulation reserves for diﬀerent allocation costs for down regula- tion reserves 17 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 3530000350004000045000 Availability Compensation − UpExpected Cost 100 % 60 % 20 % Figure 14: Expected cost of the system against diﬀerent allocation costs for up regulation reserves 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 350.00.10.20.30.4 Availability Compensation − UpExpected Loss of Load 100 % 60 % 20 % Figure 15: Expected load shedding for diﬀerent allocation costs for up regulation reserves Now the compensation for allocating up regulation reserves, ̂gU(·), is varied while other variable are kept constant. This yields constant expected wind power spill and allocated down regulation reserves, both for which plots are omitted. The expected cost evolves in the same manner as for the varying down reserves allocation compensation and can be seen in Figure 14. 18 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35350400450500 Availability Compensation − UpReserve Up 100 % 60 % 20 % Figure 16: Required up regulation reserves for diﬀerent allocation costs for up regulation reserves More interesting is to see that the expected lost load increases to above zero when the availability compensation is increased. Naturally the allocated up regulation reserves decreases with increased cost of allocation. Finally, the results obtained by varying the value of lost load are shown in Figures 17 - 19. Whereas the expected spillage and allocated down regulation reserves are unaﬀected (plots omitted), the other quantities are. The model chooses between shedding load or allocating up regulation reserves based on which is cheaper resulting in increasing reserve allocation and cost together with decreasing load shedding until the value of lost load is suﬃciently high. Thereafter the all quantities are constant since load shedding already has been avoided. 19 2 4 6 8 102200024000260002800030000 Value of Lost Load ExponentExpected Cost 100 % 60 % 20 % Figure 17: Expected cost of the system against diﬀerent allocation costs for value of lost load.

Therefore it can be concluded that an appropriate base model has been formulated that can serve as a base for further developments. This aside, nothing much can be concluded from the results due to the simplistic assumptions made. Obviously there is a long way to go before a practically applicable model is obtained. First of all the functions, ̂f D(·), ̂f U(·), ̂gD(·) and ̂gU(·), could be modeled more appropriately. Some attempts were made for constructing a conditional parametric model for the prices as a function of regulated volume and the time of day. The result is shown in Figures 20 - 21. The problem with this approach is that monotonicity is not ensured and must therefore be enforced afterwards by e.g. the method presented in [1]. Before that is tried however, it would be interesting to investigate whether conditioning upon wind and load would be of any help. These to quantities namely control a lot when it comes to determining the generation mix for a given hour and thereby the resulting spot price and which generation units are available for providing reserve power. More precisely, the regulated volume is on average higher during hours of large wind power production than during hours of low wind power production. Meanwhile, the large share of the demand supplied by wind power prompts cheaper regulating power as more cost eﬃcient units are able to provide it. This could be one of the reasons for the observed lack of monotonicity in Figures 20 - 21. This being said it should be emphasized that using any type of model that does not by its deﬁnition ensure monotonicity would require some correction on that point as post processing. Therefore it seems as an intuitively appealing idea rather to condition the parameters of model (15) upon the previously mentioned factors. Finally weather variables could be of interest for the functions for the availability market as they heavily aﬀect the operation of the decentral 22 Reg V ol.

The correlation structure between wind and load forecast errors also has to be mod- eled properly. To this end taking reliable prediction intervals from which quantiles can be obtained and subsequently use the method described in [5] would be a likely road to success. 23 A Parameters for the regulation price model Table 2: Parameter estimates for model (15) [5] Pierre Pinson, George Papaefthymiou, B.
