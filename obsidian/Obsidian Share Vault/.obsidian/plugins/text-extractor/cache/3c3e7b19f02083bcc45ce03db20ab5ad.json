{"path":"House Projects/House Rewire/attachments/afci-and-gfci-requirements-by-state-dec2020.pdf","text":"AFCI and GFCI Requirements State-by-State Data Arc-fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs) have been on the market since about the year 2000. They differ from ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), which were introduced into the NEC in the 1960s. Where GFCIs are designed to protect people from shock if parts of an electric appliance or tool become energized due to a ground fault, AFCIs are designed to protect branch circuit wiring from arcing faults. NFPA 70, National Electrical Code (NEC), first required AFCIs in the 1999 edition. Subsequent editions added locations which were required to be covered. 1999 NEC: Branch circuits serving dwelling unit bedrooms needed to be covered by AFCIs as of January 1, 2002. 2008 NEC: The use of AFCIs expanded to family rooms, dining rooms, living rooms, parlors, libraries, dens, sunrooms, recreation rooms, closets, hallways and similar rooms or areas. 2014 NEC: Kitchens and laundry areas to the list of required areas. The list has remained unchanged in the 2017 and 2020 editions of the NEC. The maps and table on the following pages detail the status of AFCI and GFCI requirements in each state. The table includes hyperlinks to state building code agencies as well as relevant documents.
