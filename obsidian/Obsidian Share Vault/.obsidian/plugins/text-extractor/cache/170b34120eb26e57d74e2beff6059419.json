It has been reintroduced along with the increasing concern about the environment issue. This recent diffusion is surrounded by lots of dynamic changes and uncertainties. However, most current studies focus on political, financial as well as infrastructure factors but neglect factors like the technology especially how people perceived it. Therefore, this study mainly research into how the technology development impact on the diffusion of battery electric vehicle. To achieve this aim, a model based study was conducted targeting Swedish electric vehicle market. In the research, customers are considered to be the target objective because they are the one who perceive the technology and make decision for adoption directly. In order to know the relationship between them, researches have been conducted through qualitative and quantitative approach. Empirical work including interviews and survey were conducted through tripartite aspect to investigate the customer needs and related technology. The investigation indicates the environmentally friendly performance is the key driving force perceived by the early adopters. Meanwhile, range issue, total cost of ownership and safety & technology reliability are identified as the top three critical concerns that hold back customer purchasing decision. A modified classic model for the innovation diffusion has been proposed which is used to evaluate the technology’s perception based on historical data. Two BEV- related technologies were chosen as examples to prove and illustrate the relationship between technology development and electric vehicle diffusion. The results showed that the BEV-related technologies, which have potential ability to address critical customer demand, are able to impact on the customer adoption positively through valid perception by customer. Taking technology development and perception into consideration, the diffusion process should be accelerated to some extent. Technologies which can be more easily perceived tend to have more impact in the diffusion process.

Det har återinförts tillsammans med den ökande oron för miljöfrågan. Denna nya diffusion är omgiven av dynamiska förändringar och osäkerheter. Men de flesta av dagens studier fokuserar på politiska, ekonomiska och infrastrukturella faktorer, men försummar faktorer relaterat till tekniken framför allt hur människor uppfattar det. Därför undersökte denna studie främst hur den tekniska utvecklingen påverkar spridningen av batteridrivna fordon. För att uppnå detta syfte, gjordes en modell baserad kring en studie av den svenska elbilsmarknaden. I forskningen anses kunderna vara målet målgruppen eftersom de är de som uppfattar tekniken och tar beslut om införandet direkt. För att veta förhållandet mellan dem, har kvalitativa och kvantitativa undersökningar genomförts. Empiriskt arbete inklusive intervjuer och undersökningen genomfördes genom tre olika aspekter för att undersöka kundernas behov och relaterad teknik. Undersökningen visar att miljövänlig prestanda är den viktigaste drivkraften som uppfattas av early adopters. Samtidigt har räckviddsproblematiken, totala ägandekostnaden och tillförlitlighet i säkerhet och teknologi identifierats som de tre kritiska problemen som tillbakahåller kunden från ett köpbeslut. En modifierad klassisk modell för innovationsspridning har föreslagits som används för att utvärdera teknikens uppfattning baserad på historiska data. Två BEV-relaterade teknologier valdes som exempel för att bevisa och illustrera förhållandet mellan teknikutveckling och elbilsdiffusion. Resultaten visade att BEV-relaterad teknologi, som har potential förmåga att ta itu med den kritiska efterfrågan från kunderna, kan påverka kundacceptans positivt genom giltig uppfattning av kunden. Om teknikutveckling och uppfattning beaktas, bör diffusionsprocessen påskyndas i viss utsträckning. Teknik som lättare kan uppfattas tenderar att ha mer genomslag i diffusionsprocessen.

Introduction The chapter is going to present a general background to the adoption of Electrical Vehicle which contains the implication of potential research problem and followed by the research purpose and question formulations. At last, the delimitation and an overall proposition of the thesis will also be discussed. 1.1 Background Automobile industry proved to be one of the largest and most important industries in the world. Currently, there are more than 1 billion automobiles in use worldwide. The boom of automobile industry, on one hand, is satisfying huge demand in daily life; on the other hand, causing a series of major environmental issues such as air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, energy shortage and so on. In order to tackle these environmental issues, the European Commission (2012) formally proposed an average CO2 emissions target of 95 g/km for 2020, which translated into fuel consumption equates to about 3.8 liters/100km. The target supposes to be achieved by realizing a series of sub-target in different sector by year. The diagram below shows different member states’ performance in terms of passenger car sector. Even the average emission is already below the 2015 target, there are still several states have high potential to improve towards the target (ICCT, 2015). Figure 1-1 Passenger cars CO2 emissions and market share by member state (2013) Behind these numbers, is a new trend occurring in the passenger car industry: decarburizing transport is gaining its popularity. Among all, Electric Vehicle (EV) represents the latest solution to environmental issues in transport sector. Interestingly, BEV has been introduced to the market twice in history and then got wiped out due to the lower costs, better range, and superior infrastructure of gasoline cars. Concerns and demands of BEV have been shapely increased after 2010. The awareness of environmental sustainability promotes and the decreasing fuel price challenges, causing the development of BEV at the same time. Under the new technology content and a sharply increasing need of sustainability, BEV started to rise again. Also, in order to promote this sustainable and eco-friendly product, many countries provide financial and non-financial support for vehicle purchases and BEV R&D. Most of predictions show a 20 positive trend in the BEV market. For instance, the following diagram represents the forecast of BEV which was made by EVI (Electric Vehicles Initiative) in 2012. Figure 1-2 BEV sales target (source: EVI 2013) However, sales data represents a pessimistic image. Take Sweden for example, 1266 battery electric vehicles out of 324037 vehicles (0.39%) were sold in 2014 (SCB, 2014). Also, Energy Information Administration (EIA), an organization of US department of energy, forecasted that the vast majority of cars will still use gasoline in the year 2040. According to the group's 2014 Annual Energy Outlook, a staggering 78 percent of light duty vehicles will still be sold with gasoline engines in 2040, compared to just one percent plug-in hybrids, one percent full electric vehicles (Hollister, 2013). As the emergence of BEV is a result of increasing sustainability concern, the policy support would be strong driving force to the diffusion at beginning. Policy support can decrease the initial purchase price and promote infrastructure construction etc. However, the support could only afford at the entering stage and the impact could hardly last for long-term. For example, along with the increasing registration of electric cars in Sweden, the government budgets for subsidy of purchasing BEV will run out in the end of July in 2015, again (Bilsweden.se, 2015). Also, the high uncertainty and decreasing power of policy support require progressive technology development for BEV, especially when it plays the role as a potential substitute role of fuel vehicle in mass market. Therefore, to be able to win the competition in future, BEV development needs to create more competitive edge of meeting the customers’ need, at least fulfill the basic transportation need. At current stage, the BEV-related technology can be considered as a weak point which has great potential improving space and future impact along the diffusion process. 1.2 Problem Formulation It is essential for a product provider to be aware of the possible future customer reaction when introducing a new product in the marketplace. However, the dynamic environment and the high-speed development of EV technology reveal high level of uncertainty in EV market. Thus, it is a challenge today to manage strategies based on a profound understanding of the relation between EV technology changes and electric vehicle diffusion. As a promising environmental innovation at its early stage, the research about how identified superior technology development affects the diffusion of EV is impending. Among all, the updated technology factor is a relatively unexplored field in relation with customer behavior, regarding its importance and 21 rapid change. Therefore, it is very interesting to investigate into how market probably reacts to the EV technology development through (potential) customer decision. 1.3 Purpose and Research Question This study is committing to provide logical analysis and modeling about how the customer decision towards battery electric vehicle would be affected along with certain technology change. In order to meet the objective, the content of this research will be based on the answers of the following question: Main research question: How does technology development impact customer adoption of battery electric vehicle? The research question can be broken down into 2 sub questions: 1. What are the customer expectations towards BEV, correlated with the practical performance of technology? 2. What is the result of the electric vehicle diffusion modeling, considering the perception of representative technology performance as independent variable? 1.4 Delimitation Since the study should be conducted in a planned schedule and the analysis of EV diffusion is rather complex, several delimitations have to be made in advance. First of all, this study only focuses on electric passenger cars. Heavy electric vehicles (such as buses, heavy trucks) are not in the focused category. This delimitation was made because the user, technology and diffusion of heavy EV differ largely from personal BEV. Secondly, this study only focuses on 100% cell EV (pure battery electric vehicle). There are different kinds of EVs existing in the market, such as micro hybrid electric vehicle, mild hybrid electric vehicle, full hybrid electric vehicle, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, and electric vehicle. Each of them has a different set of data and requires different approaches. Thirdly, forecasting diffusion in a very long period may decrease the validity of the study since there will be lot of uncertainty. Meanwhile, a short period forecast will be less useful. Under this situation, the thesis will discuss on the upcoming ten years. Fourthly, the thesis will focus on Swedish circumstance but still provide implication for other markets. Despite considerable interest in electric mobility, consumer demand which is showed by the data of new registration electric vehicles in Sweden remains very low. Meanwhile, the Swedish government has made an ambitious goal of creating fossil fuel free cities by 2030. The big gap between the current situation and the goal makes investigating the case of Sweden diverse from other cases such as Norway and U.S. Besides, the Swedish government has announced a favorable policy of providing a subsidy of 40000 SEK for every purchasing BEV. This policy only has the impact on the initial price making it easier to investigating other factors without much interference of government-backed stimulus. Therefore, Sweden is a representative case of studying technological factors. Lastly, since the study initiates from BEV provider perspective, customer psychology and behavior at present will be elaborated but the dynamic view of them will not be discussed. Also, the technology we are going to analysis excludes the area of infrastructure and other substitution of vehicle because many BEV providers do not produce BEV infrastructure. 22 2. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework The chapter lists all the concepts and theories will be used in this paper from previous literature. The introduction of electric vehicle started by general historical view description and followed by market and customer description; at last the two representative technologies will be simply presented. In terms of innovation diffusion theories and its application, the key concepts will play a theoretical guidance role and selected model will be used as the tool for the overall thesis work. 2.1 The Electric Vehicle Electric mobility relates to electrification of the automotive powertrain, refers to EVs (electric vehicles) as all vehicles for which an electric motor is the primary source of propulsion. This includes plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Among these cars, the main distinction identified is the powertrain system. BEV is the one using huge energy battery with power electronics and E-motor, replacing the traditional fuel tank and combustion engine. It is a purely electric drive vehicle with short-medium range which can only charge the battery from the grid while stationary (McKinsey, 2014). 2.1.1 The Historical View The first BEV was built by Thomas Davenport in 1834; even a few decades earlier than the first Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicle. The first vehicle to surpass the 100 km/h barrier was also a battery vehicle, namely the ‘Jamais Contente’ which was driven by Camille Jenatzy in 1899 (Chau and Wong, 2002). In comparison with ICE vehicles, BEVs were comfortable, quiet and clean. However, due to the limited energy storage capacity of the battery, the range was very limited, and at the same time, the ICE was improving dramatically. As a consequence, the BEV almost vanished by the 1930s (Hybrid vehicles and the future of personal transportation, 2009). But, due to the energy crisis and oil shortage in the 1970s, automakers and policymakers started to re-think the BEV, as it offered high energy efficiency and allowed the diversification of energy resources, as well as having zero local emissions and helping to improve urban air quality. 2.1.2 Definition and characteristic Battery vehicles use an electric motor for traction instead of an ICE, and use batteries for their energy source instead of liquid fuels. BEVs have many advantages over conventional ICE vehicles, such as no tailpipe emissions, high efficiency and potential for independence from fossil fuels and quiet and smooth operation. The characteristics of the BEV and HEV battery packs are very different. The BEV battery pack has high specific energy while the HEV battery pack has high specific power. Since the motor in a power-assist (grid-independent) HEV is used intermittently and must be capable of producing high power for short periods of time (e.g. during maximum acceleration), its battery pack should be optimized for high power. The battery vehicle drive train consists of three major sub-systems: • Electric motor propulsion system—vehicle controller, power electronic converter, the electric motor and transmission; • Battery system—batteries, Battery Management System (BMS) and charging unit; • Auxiliary system—heating/cooling, electric pumps and other electronic auxiliaries. The principle of the BEV is very straight forward, based on the control inputs from the accelerator and brake pedals, the vehicle controller provides proper control signals to the electronic power converter, which functions to regulate the power flow between the electric motor and battery. The motor can also 23 play the role of a generator, converting the braking energy to electrons and charging the battery. The energy management unit cooperates with the vehicle controller to control the regenerative braking and its energy recovery. The electric motors produce a great amount of torque from rest to give amazing performance. In terms of acceleration and power, BEVs are superior to IC vehicles. 2.1.3 Current challenge While significant progress has been made in developing automotive batteries, major challenges remain, as follows: • Reducing cost—currently a Lithium battery with 35 kWh storage capacity costs around $30,000 to manufacture, while a few organizations (ANL, IEA, EPRI, CARB) project future prices around one-third of this. Reducing the cost of battery packs is therefore the key challenge for BEV development (BERR & Department for Transport, 2008) and the development of technology is the key to reduce the cost. • Improving safety—Current lithium batteries may suffer from the potential issue with overcharging, voltage control and battery fire. Some solutions such as Lithium iron phosphate cathodes can prevent these issues, but they will inevitably increase the battery cost further. • Prolonging the life-span—as an automotive battery, it should last at least 10 years or 150,000 miles under a variety of conditions, whereas e.g. the current average life of vehicles registered in the UK is 14 years. • Shortening the charging time to a matter of minutes, and providing better charging facilities. • Reducing the size and weight of the battery pack. 2.1.4 The Market Context Overall, there are 2748 registered BEV in Sweden until the end of first quarter of 2015 according to Statistics Sweden (SCB). In Sweden, the best-selling battery passenger cars are Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. In general, Swedish customer has been considered as early adopter to new technology and is environmental friendly preferable. Internal organizations like Stockholms Stad and Vattenfall (a state owned energy provider) conducted a pre-study on market analysis for the BEV introduction in Sweden indicates that Swedes are early adopters of technology and that the general level of environmental awareness is high (Stockholms Stad & Vattenfall, 2010). Outsiders such as U.S. Commercial Service Global Automotive Team (2012) came out of the similar conclusion that ‘the Swedish market is exceptionally favorable for environmental initiatives’ and ‘Swedes in general are early adopters of new technologies’. All those facts indicate that Sweden could have favourable market conditions for BEVs regarding its high potential consumer demand. When it comes to the specific BEVs, Craven’s study about the electromobility in Sweden refers to two set of data about demand and preference of Swedes (Craven, 2012). One is the Accenture’s global survey (2011) measured global customer attitudes and preferences toward EVs, using randomly selected participants. The result shows 64% out of 500 Swedish respondents (global average: 58%) were very much in favor of BEVs replacing conventional cars over time. But the real purchase demand is a bit lesser, 53% Swedes (average 60%) indicated they would consider an EV or PHEV for their next car 24 purchase. Another study was conducted by utilities provider which reveals that nearly 37% Swedes surveyed believed they would buy an EV within ten years (Fortum, 2011). Even though Sweden has been identified as high potential market, stakeholders should not to be over- confident about the market performance and always pay more attention to customer demand. The real market performance can be one reflection of the customer demand. In Europe EV market, the early adoption took off in 2012, a comprehensive research about its prospect given by Amsterdam Roundtable Foundation and McKinsey & Company (2014) identified Norway and Netherlands as market leader or pioneer. Even Sweden has caught up a little from 2014; it still has a long way to catch up compare with the two giant markets. As we can see in the figure below, the uptake rate of EVs increased obviously, but mostly because of the mass growth of PHEV rather than BEV. This performance drew the attention of the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) when analyzing the global market. Compare to the average EU 28 market, Swedish uptake of HEV exceed the EU28 average more than 50% from the first day (2004) while the BEV market performance tend to be ordinary, which is very close to the average (ICCT, 2015). More specifically, the growth of EV sales in Sweden is the success of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV in the first half of 2014. Sales of this newly launched, competitively priced hybrid SUV almost doubled every month (except May), and it was the second-best-selling SUV in June (ICCT, 2014). Figure 2-1 2012-2014 Market shares (new sales) of electric passenger cars (ICCT, 2014) From both outsider and insider’s perspective, Sweden has been identified as a very promising market for future BEV adoption regarding its favorable market condition. The real market performance proved Swedish market potential for environmental friendly car in general, but also show Swedish customer’s preference of PHEV rather than BEV. All these facts depict a bright and challenged future in front of Swedish BEV adoption. 25 2.1.5 Customer Adoption Study Early Adopter From two worldwide researches conducted by Accenture in 2011 and McKinsey in 2014, we are able to summarize the typical early BEV adopter characteristic and user experience. The typical customer is a mid-30s to early-40s years old well-educated people, who has primarily high-income, and is expecting his second car be able to save money, or to be environmental friendly, or both. The electric car can basically serve customer’s daily driving requirements with tempering range anxiety (Accenture, 2011; Amsterdam Roundtable Foundation and McKinsey & Company, 2014). Since there is no complete empirical study about BEV customer in Sweden, we learnt from the pioneer BEV diffusion country - Norway. A survey has gathered 1,858 BEV users experience. The typical Norwegian BEV user identified as a middle education and income citizen who owns a Nissan LEAF as one of two cars. He drives his electric car on a daily basis instead of a traditional petrol or diesel car. And he agrees that his electric car saves him money and time and he is very satisfied as a BEV owner (Haugneland and Håvard Kvisle, 2013). Norwegian image is quite similar to the worldwide ones, with the only difference in saving time. It might due to the special policy support by Norway government such as free toll roads and access to bus lanes. As the report also summarizes that the broad package of incentives convinced the BEV user to buy his electric car (ibid). Recent research concludes that the most frequently cited barriers to BEV adoption by the broader customer pool are high costs, range anxiety and low awareness (ibid.). Similar result can be found from a global study by Accenture (2011), a European survey by Deloitte (2011) and a Swedish investigation by SIKA (2006). Range Anxiety However, in terms of the range anxiety, all those researches reveal the same fact that respondent expect far more range (more than 400 km) of BEVs than their practical daily basis driving need (27km in Sweden). Although current BEV can technically provide far more range than customer need, the range anxiety occur by the comparison with traditional ICE car, inconvenient charging and the special condition (Craven, 2012). The Total Cost Ownership The total cost ownership consists of vehicle’s initial purchase price, maintenance and fuel costs, the infrastructure costs over the lifespan of the automobile, and the resale value. Sometimes, insurance and financing costs are also included (Kampman et al., 2011). In terms of BEV, the expensive battery is the main reason that lead to the high initial cost compare with similar combustion engine car. Low Awareness The low awareness can be interpreted as the unfamiliarity of the product / technology, which is a common problem in the early diffusion stage for an innovation. In a global research, 36% of Swedes (average 30%) thought they understand enough about electric vehicles when making a decision on their next purchase (Accenture, 2011). Even Swedes are identified as high environmental awareness and be relatively more willing to try new technology; they still have great potential to improve their familiarity of the product. The awareness could be directly increased by marketing effort such as advertising and promotion event, but hardly by technology development. However, the increasing visibility of the public recharging 26 infrastructure can act as both a way of increasing awareness and familiarity of electric vehicle as well as a means of providing reassurance against range anxiety (Craven, 2012). Safety and Technology Reliability Safety is always being considered as a necessary criterion when choosing a vehicle no matter which engine it use (Plötz, Gnann and Wietschel, 2014). Even the restriction influence not appears to be very significant for BEV right now; it will affect the adoption especially for new product once a negative picture shows out. For example, the Tesla mode accident draws massive attention to the safety concern of battery car. In 2013, a Tesla model S burning video shaved $2.4 billion off the company's market value in 2 days (Klayman, 2015). It was the reflection of the stakeholders certain faith losing and the public goes panic. Technically, this factor is worried by scientist as well. They believe that the amount of possible failure modes occur during operation increase along with the higher electrification of BEV than traditional device with higher level of electrification (Wanner, Jonasson and Wallmark, 2015). It is not just a scientific concern about also people’s stereotype about electrified product as well. 2.1.6 The Technology of Electric Vehicle Since the researchers decided to use a mathematical model to visualize the answer of research question, 2 representative technologies were chosen as examples of technological variables. The choose process will be presented in chapter 5.2 while the basic review of these technologies would be presented in the following text as a knowledge foundation. The Battery A battery is an electrochemical cell (or Galvanic cell) that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy; it consists of an anode and a cathode, separated by an electrolyte (anionic conductor which is also an electronically insulating medium). Electrons are generated at the anode and flow towards the cathode through the external circuit while, at the same time, electro neutrality is ensured by ion transport across the electrolyte (Pollet, Staffell and Shang, 2012). The two main types of battery used in BEVs are nickel metal hydride (NiMH) and lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. NiMH batteries are, in most cases, used as secondary energy sources in HEVs whereas Li-ion batteries are used as primary energy sources in BEVs. Since this thesis focus on BEV, lithium-ion batteries will be discussed mainly. Lithium-ion batteries Lithium-ion batteries are light, compact and operate with a cell voltage of ∼4V with a better energy density compared with other batteries. The diagram below shows the comparison of the various battery technologies in terms of energy density. 27 Figure 2-2 Battery energy density (source: Tarascon and Armand, 2001) Battery energy density (Wh/kg) is a key measurement how much energy a battery can hold (Batteryuniversity.com, 2010). Higher energy density means a battery is capable to provide more energy with even less weight. R&D of battery energy density is well-focused. Large funding is provided to Battery energy density project (Howell, 2014). The battery energy density development is in a very promising situation that draws attention of lots of governments and battery manufacturers. In practical, this technology has developed quickly over these years. The diagram below shows the variation of energy density of different commonly used battery in BEV (Red line: Panasonic 18650 Li-ion Cells which are used in Tesla Model S (Straubel, 2014). Although Huggins’ (2009) study shows that there will be a bottleneck of Lithium battery energy density in the future, the calculations of Huggins study indicate Li/CuCl2 cells have an MTSE of 1166.4 Wh/kg which is 5 times the capacity of current batteries. Figure 2-3 the battery energy density trend (Straubel, 2014) The Battery Management System (BMS) As one of the “invisible” technology, BMS plays a very important part in BEV energy system. A battery management system (BMS) is an electronic regulator that monitors and controls the charging and discharging of rechargeable batteries (Haughn, 2014). The purpose of the BMS is to guarantee safe and reliable battery operation. To maintain the safety and reliability of the battery, state monitoring and 28 evaluation, charge control, and cell balancing are functionalities that have been implemented in BMS. (Xing et al., 2011) Moreover, BMS can also prolong the life of the battery; protect the battery from different kinds of damages and achieve a series of function that maintain the battery in a good state. (Mpoweruk.com, 2015) More specifically, Xing et al. (2011) stated that a comprehensive BMS should include the following functions: • Data acquisition • Safety protection • Ability to determine and predict the state of the battery • Ability to control battery charging and discharging • Cell balancing • Thermal management • Delivery of battery status and authentication to a user interface • Communication with all battery components • Prolonged battery life Currently, NiMH batteries and Lithium battery are the main choices of BEV battery, as mentioned above. And Lithium battery is getting a bigger and bigger portion in the market. But some characteristic of Lithium battery shows a need of BMS to keep the performance at a high level. In EVs and HEVs, batteries are wired in parallel to form a block to satisfy the requirement of high capacity while several blocks (or cells) are connected in series to provide a high voltage. However, the quickly dropping voltage when lithium batteries discharge to a certain stage have a negative impact on stability. The diagrams (Figure 2-4) below show that lithium batteries have a fairly flat discharge curve with sharp shoulders. Figure 2-4 Lithium battery discharge curve (Enerdel, 2012) As one of the functions of BMS, battery balancing provides a tolerance system to avoid the batteries reaching the sharp-losing-voltage area. It creates a charge / discharge cycle to insure all the batteries are charged / discharged at similar level. This function guaranteed the stability of the batteries usage. BMS also have some communication and interactive functions. A fully discharged lithium battery will be badly destroyed. BMS can inform the user the low battery power and shutdown the battery pack before the 29 batteries get fully discharged. This function would extend the lifespan of the batteries and save cost in an indirect way. Researches also show that the lithium battery performance varies when the temperature is too high or too low. When the temperature is high, the battery pack tends to lose much more power which will massively lower the capacity of the whole battery pack (Mpoweruk.com, 2005). The diagram (2-5) below shows a protection mechanism to control the temperature of the battery pack and avoid the battery failures. Figure 2-5 cell failures, consequences and protection mechanisms (Mpoweruk.com, 2005) Besides the regular battery protection, BMS also responds to unexpected conditions by going to failsafe model or complete shutdown depending on the circumstances. For example: over-temp, suddenly cell failure, and crash. 2.2 The Innovation Diffusion and Technology Adoption The initiator for diffusion research is a French lawyer - Gabriel Tarde (1903) who suggested the “The laws of imitation” and presented the S-shaped diffusion curve, which concept was far ahead of his time. And the real exploration of innovation research took place from Rogers book “Diffusion of Innovation”, published in 1962, which is still the most cited work in the field of diffusion (Roback, 2006). Definition In Rogers work, he defined that “Diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system (see figure 2-3).” And he 30 emphasized that the four main elements - innovation, communication channels, time, and the social system are identifiable in every diffusion research study and in every diffusion program (Rogers, 2003). Figure 2-6 the Diffusion Process (Rogers, 2003) Apart from Rogers’ definition, the “diffusion of innovation” can also be considered as the third stage of technological change in which the innovations spread across the potential market, regarding the Schumpeterian trilogy (Stoneman, 1995). The Technology Adoption Lifecycle In the very early diffusion process model study by Joe M. Bohlen, George M. Beal and Everett M. Rogers (1957), they made an extension model called the “technology adoption lifecycle”. This sociological model (see blue line in figure 2-4) aims to describe how new ideas and technologies spread in different cultures and frequently. The Bell-shaped curve shows how cumulative number of adopters in the social system change on a frequency basis, while the yellow line represents the aggregative amount. The rate of adoption is a numerical indicator of the steepness of the adoption curve for an innovation. One of the definition for it is “the rate of adoption is the relative speed with which an innovation is adopted by members of a social system. It is generally measured as the number of individuals who adopt a new idea in a specified period, such as a year” (Rogers, 2003). Figure 2-7 Rogers’ idealized diffusion and adoption curves 31 The Categories of Adopters Arts et al. (2011) have stated that customer characteristics could affect the innovation adoption, and psychographics such as attitudes and aspirations have shown to be useful in relation to innovation adoption as well. Thus, it is essential to know the categories of adopter, such as what has shown in the figure 2-5, Rogers (2003) has identified 5 types of innovation adopters: 1) Innovators, 2) Early adopters, 3) Early majority, 4) Late majority and 5) Laggards. Those adopter categories are divided according to their adoption period and each has its own behavioural and mental characteristics. Rogers’ classification has become very commonly used within innovation diffusion and adoption study, although some alternative names are used sometimes, for example technology enthusiasts, visionaries, pragmatist, conservatives and skeptics respectively for the categories listed above (Mohr et al., 2014). The Variables Determining the Rate of Adoption A couple of attributes of innovation have been argued to affect the rate of diffusion of innovation and also the prospects of future adoption. In Rogers’s book (2003), those variables can be summarized by considering customer as the key decision maker for deciding the rate of adoption. Under this case, it is essential to identify what are the different factors that affect the rate of adoption. Many of the researchers taking about the innovation itself always focusing on the perceived attributes of innovation, which are as (1) relative advantage, (2) compatibility, (3) complexity, (4) trialability, and (5) observability. Among all, the innovation perceived as having most relative advantages were adopted more rapidly while the other attributes have less contribution to the rate of adoption (Fliegel and Kivlin, 1966). Other variables like the type of innovation-decision, communication channel, nature of social system and extent of change agents' promotion efforts also play important role in determine the adoption rate but beyond the delimitation of this paper. The classification of different variables that can give theory support for identifying what influence factors are, while the application of modeling innovation diffusion process is able to answer how these factors influence the customer decision throughout the time period. Since the purpose of this study is to test the significance of the relationship between the technology variables and the customer adoption of BEV. Instead of going deep into the mechanism of innovation diffusion, this research will use modeling as tool to conduct the test of impact, meanwhile to get visualized and numerical result. 2.3 The modeling of innovation diffusion In terms the modeling of innovation diffusion, the market penetration model can be considered as the application in marketing which serve not only the purpose of our research question but also help firms to make critical decision when developing and introducing new products into the marketplace. The battery electric vehicle as a new product introduced in Swedish market recently, applying market penetration model could be very applicable and beneficial to its diffusion study. In order to choose a correct model, Frenzel-Baudisch and Grupp (2006) has conduct a comprehensive summary and evaluation among 10 types of most commonly used diffusion model, in which gave a very clear understand and complete knowledge. Their result indicates that the Bass model is the one has the best forecasting abilities of all the compared models. Not only proved by theoretical investigation, the reliability of Bass Model’s market forecast had also been tested by analyzing different consumer durable goods during these 4 decades (Evans et al., 2006). 32 Besides conducting reliable forecast, Venkatesan and Kumar (2002) indicated the Bass model can also provide attractive behavioral implication regarding customer motivation which could assist managerial decision-making. Thus, several big U.S. corporates is in favor of using Bass model to study the new technology’s market penetration, including IBM, Sears and AT&T (Rogers, 2003). On empirical level, many researchers have used (derived) Bass model for the market forecasting of alternative powertrain technologies adoption under chosen factor’s influence in automobile market. For example, Becker (2009; electric vehicles in the United States), Muraleedharakurup et al. (2010; hybrid electric vehicles in UK), Park et al. (2011; hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in Korea), Brauer (2011; hybrid heavy duty vehicles in Europe), and Kong and Bi (2014; electric vehicles in China). 2.3.1 Bass Model The Bass Model, or namely Bass Diffusion / Forecasting / Prediction Model, is raised by a marketing professor Frank Bass, to estimate the rate of adoption of new consumer durables by deducing the timing of initial purchase of new products (Bass, 1969). As one the most popular model in the field of marketing, because it offers some plausible answers to the uncertainty associated with the introduction of a new product in the marketplace. A second important contribution of the Bass model is to provide a mathematical formula for predicting rate of adoption (Rogers, 2003). Premise and basic assumptions: ● The probability that an initial purchase will be made at time T given that no purchase has yet been made is a linear function of the number of previous buyers. ● Over the period of interest (life of the product), there will be m initial purchases of the product. Modified from the 5 following adopter categories raised by Rogers: (1) Innovators; (2) Early Adopters; (3) Early Majority; (4) Late Majority; (5) Laggards, Bass classified adopters into two main groups depends on their degree of innovativeness and the degree of imitation among adopters. To describe more specific, the initial purchases of the product are made by both ‘innovators’ and ‘imitators’. The important distinction between an innovator and an imitator is the buying influence. Innovators (refer to group 1) are not influenced in the timing of their initial purchase by the number of people who have already bought the product, in other words, they decide to adopt an innovation independently of the decision of other individual on a social system. Apart from innovators, imitators (aggregate groups 2-5) are influenced by the number of previous. Imitators ‘learn’, in some sense, from those who have already bought and by the pressures of the social system. Figure 2-8 the product adoption process under Bass Model (Rogers, 2003) 33 According to Bass’ behavioral rationale for assumptions, the importance of innovators will be greater at first but will diminish monotonically with time; the number of new adopters can be illustrated as the figure above. Its curve fit the bell-shape like general product adoption model, distinguishing two different types of adopter whose decision change along with time. Model formulation Mathematically, the basic Bass Model as a Riccati equation with constant coefficients is given by the equation: 𝑓(𝑇) 1−𝐹(𝑇) = 𝑝 + 𝑞𝑞(𝑇) (1) where f is the likelihood of purchase at time T, and F is the cumulative penetration, mathematically 𝑞(𝑇) = 𝑑𝑑(𝑇)/𝑑𝑑 . On the right side of the equation, p represents the coefficient of innovation and q is the coefficient of imitation (Bass, 1969). We defines m as the total number purchasing during the period, 𝑆(𝑇) as the timing sales at T. Thus, we have 𝑆(𝑇) = 𝑚𝑑(𝑇). The 𝑌(𝑇) is the cumulative sales at time T, equaling to 𝑚𝑞(𝑇). Considering equation (1), the relation between the cumulative sales and timing sales is: 𝑆(𝑇) = 𝑑𝑌(𝑇)/𝑑𝑑 = 𝑝[𝑚 − 𝑌(𝑇)] + ( 𝑞 𝑚)𝑌(𝑇)[𝑚 − 𝑌(𝑑)] (2) The meaning of 𝑝[𝑚 − 𝑌(𝑇)] refers to the number of “innovators” while the ( 𝑞 𝑚)𝑌(𝑇)[𝑚 − 𝑌(𝑑)] represents the number of adopters who are influenced by the number of previous buyer, so called “imitators”. 2.3.2 The Generalized Bass Model (GBM) However, researchers criticized the original bass diffusion model fail to consider external variables which can affect the market penetration of new products such as marketing effort and cost reduction, so the Generalized Bass Diffusion Model (GBM) was proposed by Bass and other researchers in 1994. The key advantage of the GBM is its flexibility which promote the accuracy of the researches, although it is relative more complicated to deal with. It has proven itself to be as good as or better than the original Bass model in almost every case while the original model can be consider as a special case for GBM (Bass et al., 1994). For example, a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy formulated a new innovation diffusion model dedicated studying fiscal support as external factor that impact renewable energy technology diffusion, which is the modification result of GBM (Evans et al., 2006). The GBM is the one of the most obvious generalization that p and q are permitted to vary with time. Bass suggest the new equation below, reminding the fundamental character of equation (1): 𝑓(𝑇) 1−𝐹(𝑇) = [𝑝 + 𝑞𝑞(𝑇)]𝑥(𝑇) (3) Here x(T) is called \"current marketing effort\" reflects the current effect of dynamic marketing variables on the conditional probability of adoption at T. Although it is called \"current marketing effort,\" the 𝑥(𝑇) can represent the effects of lags in the decision variables. Under this case, we can have \"carryover 34 effects\" like advertising and other lagged effects being mapped to 𝑥(𝑇) (Bass et al., 1994). Accordingly, the timing sales 𝑆(𝑇) at T become: 𝑆(𝑇) = 𝑑𝑌(𝑇)𝑑𝑑 = {𝑝[𝑚 − 𝑌(𝑇)] + (𝑞/𝑚)𝑌(𝑇)[𝑚 − 𝑌(𝑑)]} ∗ 𝑥(𝑇) (4) Specifically, 𝑥(𝑇) is made up of the sum of time-dependent decision variables, standardized so that relative changes in these factors affect the curve. Graphically, 𝑥(𝑇) horizontally stretches and squishes the s-curve, but as it is time-variant, it does not do so uniformly. The standardized changes are also weighted by variables β1, β2..., so that the relative importance of the decision variables can be accounted for (Evans et al., 2006). In order words, any factors that changes along with time and has a predictable effect on the demand for a product is able to be modeled by the GBM. One of the standard application of the GBM is to use price and advertising as current marketing effects in the𝑥(𝑇). The complicated function for 𝑥(𝑇) showed as below in discrete time: , or (5), where 𝑃𝑃(𝑇) and 𝐴𝑑𝐴(𝑇) are defined as price and advertising functions (data), respectively. Because a negative change in price expected to affect the slope of adoption rate positively, the 𝛽1 is supposed to be a negative number. Under the similar deduction, the sign of 𝛽1is also expected to be negative (Bass et al., 1994). Even these numbers are arbitrary correlated with the model, that the model keeps track of is the “change” in price and in advertising. Be aware that, the market potential m is not visible in this rate of adoption model. Thus, the Generalized Bass Model could be used with settled market potential which will not be influenced by decision variables directly (𝑚 = constant) as in the original Bass Model, or it could be treated as a function of decision variables (𝑚 = m(T)) and estimated in conjunction with the parameters of GBM. In summary, the original Bass Model is a high level reliable tool for analyzing new technology’s introduction to marketplace by estimating adopter’s behaviours while the GBM is a developed model with the time-dependent external variables consideration. Regarding decades of empirical works for analogous technology, a modified GBM could feed the need of this particular research, since our purpose is to analysis how the adoption of BEV react to the development of predominated technology through the impact on customer perception. 35 3. Methodology This chapter describes which methodology has been chosen during the overall research approach, from literature review to empirical data collection and analysis. The explanation about how they serve the need of the research purpose in a scientific way will be presented as well. 3.1 Research approach Since this research is to understand how the technology as variable impact on customer adoption, several methodologies were taken based on different needs in the data collection and data analysis approaches respectively. For the sake of decreasing data source bias (Jick, 1979) and greater validity and reliability (Denzin, 1978), this thesis used triangulation as the primary methodology in general. With this methodology, more than one method could be used for data collection and analysis, and more than one source of data will be collected for one topic as well (Collis & Hussey, 2009). It also means both the qualitative method like interview and quantitative approach such as modeling will be used in this research. In the overall approach, literature review worked as the main secondary data resource and supplementary information supplied along the whole research process. Firstly, scientific reports and websites have been used to map the history and current situation of BEV diffusion. A rough background was generalized by then. Scientific reports also supplied a general understanding of the theoretical framework such as bass diffusion model. Vehicle parameters and sales which were used for analyzing and calculating were mainly gathered from official website such as SCB and BEV supplier website. Other documents or relevant source provided multiple stories and phenomena to support and explain some of the customer behaviour and mentality. The keywords used for the literature search in the area of EV were: ● Electric Vehicles ● Pure Battery Electric Vehicles ● The electric motor ● Electric battery for vehicle The keywords used for the literature search in the area of innovation diffusion were: ● Innovation Diffusion ● Technology Adoption ● The Rate of Adoption ● Market penetration model ● Customer behaviour The source of literature review is on one hand from online databases such as KTH Library service Primo, Google Scholar and other available database and on the other hand in form of documentation such as books, previously published studies and conference papers. When the secondary data is collected through literature review, the primary data are collected through empirical work. The main empirical works we have done are 5 semi-structure interviews and 226 customer surveys that presented below in detail. 36 3.2 Empirical Data Collection When the data triangulation methodology is decided to be used, data should be collected at different times or from different sources in the study of a phenomenon (Smith and Dainty, 1991). Therefore, the significant part of the data in this study was collected from multiple sources. Such as the information about BEV customer in Sweden are designed to collect from sources of different perspective: the customers themselves, the BEV provider and the independent technology specialist. 3.2.1 Semi-structured Interview Five semi-structure interviews have been taken in total. Four interviews with KTH experts in BEV-related field were face-to-face while the interview with company EV manager was conducted through telephone. The reason for choosing this particular method is to access more perceived or non-literal facts from the interviewee’s practical experience. It is considered as the optimal research method which explores “data on understandings, opinions, what people remember doing, attitudes, feelings and the like, that people have in common (Arksey and Knight 1992)”. All interviews were semi-structured because this approach allows interviewers to provide some guidance that ensures that key questions are asked, and also provide them flexibility to follow up on interesting aspects that were unknown in advance of the interview (Blomkvist and Hallin, 2014). And in order to mitigate interviewer misinterpretation, we arranged two interviewers to each interviewee. When two people conduct an interview, one can take notes and one can lead the interview or both can take notes (Eisenhardt, 1989). In order to involve the BEV-related independent researchers in this research, we gathered the information about the potential interviewee through KTH website as well as the recommendation from supervisor or participants. Fourteen selected experts from different BEV projects have been invited for a 45-minute interview through email and four of them agreed to participate. Fortunately, these four experts are from different department with different focused area of BEV, covering the field of structure battery for BEV, vehicle’s composite material, electric machine, power electronic and the control, electric drive train in the EVs, clean energy product, the HEV market diffusion regarding industrial dynamics, and on-road charging solution. Their field of research and experience are able to provide relative comprehensive and profound information for this thesis. The BEV supplier side interview was provided by Nissan which is one of the biggest BEV providers in Sweden (Nissan Leaf is the best-selling BEV in Sweden at present). The Nissan Nordic EV fleet manager, with 8 year marketing experience in automobile industry, gave the thesis another perspective to analyze and avoid bias. The interview guidance for the four technology experts was developed based on the pre-study of literature and structured into four themes: interviewee’s field of research; opinion of electric vehicle customers’ demand; technology that serve the customer demand and their opinions of the current market. In the process, the information gain from the last one has been treated as the input to adjust the question of next one. Since the interview with EV manager has been conducted at last, the interview questions are more close to the customer survey but from a supplier side, under the experience of the four conducted interviews. 37 The interviews with experts provided an insight on BEV-related technology in the experts’ fields. Meanwhile the interview with Nissan Nordic EV fleet manager helped us to understand the mechanism that how the practical performance affects the customer and how the EV provider interprets the customer behaviour. During the process, ethical issue will be focused, confidential agreement will be mentioned before the interview and a full anonymity will be provided. It is important for us to make sure the environment is trustful (Alvesson, 2003). (The interviewee information and interview guided line with suggested question please refer to Appendix 1 and 2) 3.2.2 Customer Survey Survey is considered to be the main empirical instrument for primary data collection from end customer. It was designed to gain first hand opinions and expectations from potential Swedish customer towards the purchasing decision of BEV passenger car on individual level. Although several surveys have already been conducted related to BEV customer worldwide, the purpose of this very survey is to update the first hand data dedicated to Sweden. Since the amount of sample could probably be not big enough, we used the survey result more as qualitative rather than quantitative data and comparison of the consistence with previous research was evaluated then. Regarding the design of questionnaire, the sets of interrelated variables in the survey have been carefully chosen based on the knowledge from literature review as well as observation. Since using survey has been considered more like a positivist approach, in which closed questions are very convenient and usually easy to analysis (Collis & Hussey, 2009). Thus, the overall survey consists of closed multiple questions as majority and few open questions as selective answer. In order to know the customer with different background, we designed the survey targeting different type of customers. With the help of Internet technic, the survey with different questions is sent to the people in different catalogs: BEV user, Non-BEV user with other vehicle, Non-BEV user without vehicle. We ran a beta version before officially distribution. The beta version survey has been tested by small amount of people which is essential to spot potential problem and elicit reliable responses (ibid.). After gathering their feedback and finishing corresponding modifications through pretests, the formal version survey has been sent out via Internet. To reduce unnecessary redundancy, we distribute the survey mainly to certain groups of people instead of being randomly. Besides traditional ways of sending out the QR code which linked to our survey in the street, we also post the survey advertisement on the page for Swedish people, mainly in Swedish. The web pages are Swedish Electric Car Forum, different automobile brand’s public Facebook page in Sweden, the automobile related Facebook group in Sweden. Several organization and company even helped us to share the advertisement in their public page or within their company, including Tesla Sweden Club, Volkswagen Sverige, Mitsubishi Motors Sverige, Världsnaturfonden WWF etc. This distribution method helped us get a highly-correlated data under the condition of BEV user being a very small fraction of the population. The same as the interviews, confidentiality and anonymity will be posted at the beginning of the survey and the participant will be informed that the information collected will for academic use only. 38 (The major questions and answers of the survey can be found in Appendix 3) 3.3 Data Analysis According to Yin (2003) the analysis of case study evidence is one of the least developed and most difficult aspects of doing case studies wherefore much depends on the investigator's own style of rigorous empirical thinking and careful consideration of alternative interpretations. Consequently, since the results in this thesis consist of both qualitative and quantitative data, it was necessary to restructure the data in a more comprehensive way and to contextualize it into a diagram (Collis & Hussey, 2009). Before the analysis, we presented the data gathered from the empirical work in the ‘empirical findings’ chapter, in which key information have been extracted and compared respectively. Firstly, the findings from the literature review along with empirical findings were compared and discussed to identify the factors in the aspect of technology that potentially can affect the adoption of BEV. The chosen dimensions with comparison result would be illustrated in a radar chart format. It gives a general idea of relationship in between rather than the concise evaluation number. Secondly, based on the information gathered from qualitative result, the fact about the relationship between customer adoption and the technology development will help us to modify a dedicated diffusion model. The historical data of analogy make us be able to calculate original coefficients of the model, while the study about Swedish customer behaviour and market context became the additional input for coefficient calibrations. Finally, in terms of the application of the adjusted model, control variable method has been used by considering two representative technology as independent variables while the rate of adoption as dependent variable. The other variables like price fluctuation have been set as plausible constant. 39 4. The Empirical Findings Three empirical works will be summarized and presented in this chapter in a qualitative way. Their different perspective supports each other for providing a comprehensive knowledge for the same research question. The findings are mainly from customer survey, interview with EV manager and interview with independent technology specialists. 4.1 The Customer Survey Overall, there are 226 (potential) electric passenger car customers in Sweden participated in our customer survey online, giving valid answers. 71 of them are battery electric vehicle users, 104 are regular car users and the rest of them do not have passenger car. Averagely, the participants are 40 years old, owned 1.6 passenger cars within the family and have approximately 9 years driving experience. Since different questions are designed dedicated to different customers, the result will also be presented in two main groups: 1) battery electric vehicle user, and 2) non-battery electric vehicle user. For those who are early adopters of BEV, it is very interesting to know their common characteristic and user experience. And for those who did not own BEV, it is important to find out their main concern which caused the restriction of adoption as well as their possibility to adopt in future. Furthermore, the comparison of their opinions is a way to get extra valuable information about customer perception and expectation. 4.1.2 Battery Electric Vehicle User By gathering the basic information and opinion from the 71 BEV users out of survey respondents, we are able to depict a general image of a typical Swedish battery electric vehicle owner, who probably contains those characters as listed below. ● Very possible to be a man (68 out of 71 are male) ● Around 44 years old ● Owns a bachelor degree or above ● The BEV is the second cars in his family ● Has more than ten years driving experience ● Has relative high income Their typical opinion/choice towards BEV is: ● He chose to buy the car mostly because of environmental friendly and low running cost reason, a certain part of comfort & convenience concern as well ● Drives Tesla model S or Nissan Leaf which was purchased around the May of 2013 ● Feel very satisfied with his car, and is expecting more convenience for the battery recharge and more range per charge like 320km (if not a Tesla owner) ● Normally, he drives the car on daily basis such as commuting from home to workplace or to the supermarket, sometimes for leisure purpose ● He will definitely recommend BEV to his friends ● When considering purchasing next car, he has very high level possibility to buy another BEV The general picture of Swedish adopter is quite in line with the brief description from two worldwide researches mentioned in literature review, with elaborated information (e.g. the range issue is more significant in winter time). In additional, these battery car users also specified several expectations 40 besides better range performance. Such as more options in different price ranges vehicle-to-vehicle communications, self-driving, smart internet integration etc. 4.1.3 Non - Battery Electric Vehicle User When being asked about their willingness of buying a BEV, only 28% of non-BEV user chose ‘Certain’ or ‘High chance’ and 35% of them chose 50-50. Even though it is not unexpected to notice their purchasing likelihood is much lower than the BEV user (97% have more than high certain chance to purchase a BEV for next car), the future picture doesn’t seem to be very positive. To separate the answers by whether the respondent owns a passenger car, we find out that the people who own a car has higher willingness to purchase BEV than people who doesn’t have car, which might be the result of car owner’s higher vehicle interest and familiarity. In order to identify the reason behind the unwillingness, questions from different aspects help us to find out their concern. In summary, the most cited dissatisfaction and future expectation about BEV can be interpreted as “Range Anxiety”, “Total Cost of Ownership” and “Technology reliability and safety”. Around 70% non-BEV user identified range as an issue. More specific, it is the summary concern of terms like range/battery capacity limitation, infrastructure limitation or recharge convenience etc. More than half of respondents consider the total cost of ownership hold back their purchasing, and show primary concern about the initial cost while less of them consider the maintenance or running cost as big concern. Although it is not surprised to find out people who are more sensitive to TCO has lower income, it gives a rational explanation for the great attentions on initial cost under the fact that the electricity is much cheaper than fuel. Although the technology reliability and safety factor is not emphasized as much as the two above in our survey, it is still considerable. About 30% of them don’t think the electric vehicle technologies are safe and reliable enough. Regarding 43% of non-BEV users consider safety in the priority list when choosing a passenger car in general, this factor is worth being discussed. Beside the three major concerns, around 15% non-BEV users in our survey are dissatisfied about the appearance / aesthetics or too little choice in the market. Interestingly, there are 13% of respondents skeptical about BEV’s environmentally friendly performance. This opposite opinion compared with early adopter might be a result of the lithium battery pollution and national energy structure concern. 4.1.3 The Comparison All customers were initially asked a question about their decision priority toward passenger in general. This question is duplicated from another similar survey in Germany (Plötz, Gnann and Wietschel, 2014) which conclude that the purchase price, vehicle size and safety are top three customer decision factors towards passenger car. These three criteria are also being considered as priority in our survey; with more attention on the fuel consumption. This is not only a question to get customer opinion we need but also a way to test the validity of our survey through comparison with previous valid work. After separating and comparing the result with the two different consumer groups (figure 4-1), we are able to figure out the difference between these two main customers. 41 Figure 4-1 Result for ‘What are the criteria that you value the most when you buy a passenger car? (Choose three options)’ Overall, the safety and vehicle size is no doubt the major concern, without much difference between BEV and non-BEV user. The main differences are in the aspects of fuel consumption/type, emission standard and the purchase price which are the main distinctions between BEV and regular engine car. In addition, although the acceleration is not much emphasized, the obvious difference also reflects the acceleration advantage of BEV somehow. These differences imply that in current market the BEV is just an alternative to customer who has different need and mindset, not a product for mass market yet. To analysis the range anxiety, the most critical concern identified by both BEV and non-BEV user, we compared their driving habit and range expectation. The pie charts below describe the comparison of people’s driving habit of driving a regular car with driving BEV. For non-BEV user For BEV user Figure 4-2 the comparison of non-BEV and BEV user’s driving habit from survey Unexpectedly, BEV users drive their car not only more frequently but even for longer distance than regular car users. Furthermore, BEV user has lower expectation of BEV range (320.6 km) than non-BEV user (410.9 km). It is to say, the range anxiety is not just caused by technology limitation but also by the 42 gap between consumer’s high expectation and realistic need. We can assume that the BEV users are people who are more objective about their unrealistic expectation that leads to fewer range anxiety. But unlike range anxiety, the BEV owner’s expectations towards safety remains high, compared with Non-BEV users’. This means BEV user actually have high sensitiveness of safety (refer to figure 4-1). Thus, the worries about “technology reliability and safety” are even more affected by people’s perception rather than the real capability of a technology, since the more censorious users are quite satisfied with the technology and safety performance. In summary, our survey finds out what kinds of person are easy to become BEV user and how they feel about the vehicle, which is useful to analyze ‘innovator’ in next chapter. And several reasons which restrict the adoption of electric vehicle have been identified, including the range anxiety, TCO and technology reliability and safety as top three. More importantly, besides the technology limitation, another reason behind the BEV not being able to meet mass demand is the gap between customer’s perception and the technology performance. (The specific result of different question from the survey please refer to Appendix 3) 4.2 The interview with company EV manager Since the company has no research and development department in Sweden, the EV manager with 8- year marketing experience gave us insight of customer analysis from a supplier perspective. According to the company strategy, the electric vehicle is aiming for the specific group of people in the market as an alternative instead of replacing the regular car. She identified the target customers were people being conscious of environment. In terms of the competition, since it is still a blue ocean market without intensive competition, two vehicle models of Nissan launched in the market already give them competitive edge for offering choices in different segments. At current stage, the competition existing between different battery car suppliers has not much difference. Thus, their targeted customer group (green car interested people) has not been divided very carefully in the market. When answering the main difficulties of selling an electric vehicle, the Swedish supplier summarized three factors, ranked as 1) Range, 2) Policy uncertainty, and 3) Low awareness. However, the cost is not an issue in their eyes but an advantage to some extent. Range The range is the biggest obstacle when it comes to selling the car, it is especially more significant in an extreme climate country such as Sweden. Take the best-selling BEV for example, the technically range is maximum 199km, but in practical it cannot even reach 150km in Nordic countries. Because other functions of the car will consume the electricity, such as the heating in winter time. A survey for evaluating their consumer satisfaction in Linkoping indicates that the participants feel extremely satisfied and the only exception is the higher range. However, they found out people were not anxious about range as much as they believed before, through a recently initiated leasing programme. The success of the leasing programme implies that Swedish customer has big interest with less range anxiety towards BEV, considering the rent of BEV is more expensive than petrol car. 43 Policy Uncertainty Suppliers’ worry about the future policy uncertainty since the news covered that in the end of July, it will be very possible the second time that Swedish government run out of subsidy for green car. The 40,000 SEK subsidies for each electric vehicle are considered to be a very essential for purchasing the car. There are no solving proposal raised by Swedish government yet, therefore the future policy about BEV will be ambiguous. Low awareness As being introduced in Sweden since 2011, the BEV is considered as an innovation. The very common problem for this kind of product and market is that people are lack of knowledge about it thus it is even harder to make purchase decisions. According to the EV manager’s word “people barely know what electric car is and how it works”. The company intends to put more effort on educating their customer as well as more promotion and they believe the awareness can be increased along with the adoption. TCO Not like what the customers believe, the EV manager considered the TCO as an advantage rather than weakness of BEV. Because in her calculation for BEV in general, with 60% saving in fuel consumption and 40% in maintenance, plus 2000 SEK insurance, a BEV could help the customer save around 11% cost compared with similar petrol car. The conversation with the EV manager helped us to know the current EV market is still at the infant stage with very concise focus group. The range anxiety has been raised as the top one difficulty again that emphasizes its extreme significance while the low awareness issue is an important supplementary point which we are not able to find out from customer survey. And the opposite opinion from customer and supplier towards TCO shows the gap between customer perception and the practical performance. 4.3 The interview with independent technology specialists 4 interviews were conducted to gather the view of how different EV related technology impact on costumer's demand from technology specialist’s perspective. Questions were mainly categorized into 4 aspects: Interviewee’s field of research; opinion of electric vehicle customers’ demand; technology that serve the customer demand and their opinion of the current market. To summarize, environment performance and better driving experience are identified as well accepted relative advantage of EV. And 3 key customer demands can be extracted from the interviews and find out to be highly correlated with the survey results. Their explanation and discussion of these factors are mainly from technical angle. 4.3.1 Opinion of Market future Future vision of electric vehicle is quite different according to different interviewees. Some showed a very optimistic attitude towards electric vehicle diffusion in 10 years. Meanwhile some expressed a relatively pessimistic opinion. For example, interviewee A said it was very likely that the electric vehicle will take a large portion of the vehicle market in 10 years and interviewee B believed that it is very unrealistic that the electric vehicle will become a majority in Sweden and worldwide. The following aspects are mentioned as evidence to support their opinion. 44 1. Policy support. Policy support is considered the most important drive factor to diffuse electric vehicles. (A , B & C). On one hand, favorable policy provides financial support such as subsidy; on the other hand, government may issue policy to limit the gasoline cars. 2. Technology impact. Technology factors could change the customer concern. (A & D). For example, with the development of electric road, range will not be a key concern. And the range is part of shortcomings of electric vehicles. Customers’ attentions may switch to other area and this may promote the diffusion. 3. Other countries activities. To understand the Swedish market, interviewee A,B & C all explained the importance of other countries activities. Key vehicle manufacturer will design and development more electric vehicle if the big market showed large demand. Then it provides more option for the Swedish market and promotes the diffusion in Sweden indirectly. 4.3.2 Customer Demands Environmental concern and Driving experience Environmental concern and better driving experience are the demands that BEV is able to satisfy. Interviewees interpret the environmental concern from different levels. They believed it showed environmental enthusiasm, city environmental problem solution, and personal statue of being the pioneer of environmental protection. The sensational driving experiences (such as quietness and engine performance) that a BEV can provide also became one of the factors that contributed to the customer satisfaction. Range performance All the interview candidates highlighted the importance of the range performance. Apparently, the performance of electric vehicles in the market at present is not good enough. Also, interviewee A mentioned that electric vehicle purchasing is a mentality thing. Since BEV is different from other vehicles, people tend to focus on the unique features such as range limitation other than the traditional quality criteria. Furthermore, he believed EV range performance could satisfy 99% population but when it came to purchasing decision, what an electric vehicle is capable to do is much more important than what the customer would use for. In terms of solving this demand through technology development, the interviews’ results indicate several research directions. Weight reduction has always been a key element of automotive industry R&D, which is also the field of study of interviewee A. He stressed that a way to decrease the weight could result at better performance and sustainability. With lower weight, the vehicle reduces energy consumption which leads to fuel-saving and somehow the manufacture cost-saving because of less materials being used. It is important for all vehicles while BEV would gain more benefit from this kind technology improvement. Because basically each BEV carries a huge battery pack which weighs as much as ¼-⅓ of the total Vehicle weight. To make a car lighter, interviewee A listed 3 ways: use lighter structure material like composite material (e.g. BMW i3), cut unnecessary component (e.g. Automatic braking system instead of crash protection metal), or develop multifunctional product (e.g. structural battery). Different researches are going on in parallel and most of them could have potential to apply to all types of vehicle, therein the structural battery research is the one dedicated to BEV weight reduction. It is a promising solution for BEV range issue, but according to interviewee A, the maturity of the structural battery itself and the specific vehicle issue restrict the real implementation in BEV industry in 45 a near future. Even their demonstration show good result, as a high risks innovation, the structural battery will still take researchers 15-20 year to further develop approximately. Another revolutionary method to extend the range of BEV is providing alternative way of recharging emphasized by two interviewees. Traditional charging system requires BEV parking at a specific place and waiting for 8-30 hours. Although the development of super charging station make the time as short as half an hour, the time consumption is still not widely acceptable. Electric road creates a vision that can benefit the BEV user in several aspects. If it gets implemented, the charging equipment such as the plug and long wire will be no longer needed; there will be no waiting time. The charging process will simultaneously start when a BEV enter this road; since the energy mainly come from the external road, smaller battery could be used to reduce the weight of the vehicle. However, according to interviewee D, the electric road will not be massively implemented within 50 years because of the immaturity of this technology. Cost Cost of the electric vehicles is also one of the most important factors. And the battery cost takes a very large portion of the total cost. Interviewee C believed that electric vehicle now is mostly accepted by rich or enthusiastic people. For people with low income, electric vehicle is hardly to be an option because of the high initial cost. Therefore, the initial price of electric vehicle will hinder the diffusion of electric vehicle if the price stays at such a high level. What’s more, the relatively cheap gasoline price promotes the purchase of gasoline vehicles which are the main competitor of electric vehicle. Besides the tradition way of cost reduction, 2 more methods were mentioned. Weight reduction as mentioned above is one way to reduce the running cost because it reduces the energy consumption to some extent. Meanwhile, according to interviewee A, the battery replacing cost which is currently very high will be also considered. Therefore, to prolong the battery lifespan is also an indirect path to cost reduction. Safety concern Safety concern is stressed in some of the interviews. Interviewee B mentioned that the fault in electric drive as well as the battery pack overheating can lead to serious accident. The Tesla catching fire in 2013 draws lots of attention. Interviewee A interpreted safety concern from a different angle. As mentioned above, crash protection module can be simplified as long as the safety level staying in certain level. In this area, interviewee B had a project of analyzing the impact of failure modes and the degree of in- built fault-tolerance for different vehicle control strategies in hybrid electric and pure electric vehicles. This research indicated a technical solution towards electric vehicle safety. By using sensors and actuators, vehicle control strategies are developed for electric vehicles. This can play a vital role in in- wheel motor vehicles. 4.3.3 Summary and Implications The interviews with technology specialists provided an insight of customer demand from researcher’s perspective. They also illustrate the trends of BEV technology and the dynamic of customer demand. Under each adoption issue, they listed several promising projects which seem to have great impact on future market. However, the conversations helped us to know the fact that, not all technology development can be perceived by customer perfectly. Because there are certain inevitable limitations that hinder the perception by end customer: 46 1. Some of the technology is far away from being mature. According to the experts, minimum 15 years are needed and it is beyond our thesis delimitation (e.g. structural battery, electric road). 2. Some technology will benefit for all vehicles in general which are not dedicated to particular electric ones. The customer expectation will get higher along with the overall automotive industry improvement. Such as using the composition material for reducing weight, even the battery is more sensitive in range performance; the regular car is more sensitive in fuel consumption as well. 3. Some of the technologies belong to revolutionary innovation. If these technologies are ever got implemented, the new vehicle is hard to be considered as the same product of current electric vehicle. The validity of this thesis will be decrease if the research target can lead to revolutionary change. 4. Some technologies cannot be perceived by customer easily because their function only works under small probability circumstance. For example, the crash protection is more like a mandatory requirement which can only be perceived when an accident happens. 5. Some technologies cannot reveal its significance without certain technologies being implemented. For example, electric drivetrain failure tolerance shows its high importance in in-wheel-motor vehicles. But in-wheel motor is barely used in reality because of its high cost and some disadvantages. As this research is going to study representative technology’s impact within a decade from its historical data, those limitations should take into account in technology selection. Although the mentioned research project are not selected to apply in modeling study, the well interpreted relationship between technology development and customer adoption which can be used for the following analysis. 47 5. The Analysis This chapter contains three parts of analysis based on the previous literature study and empirical findings presented above. The customer analysis maps out customer expectation compare with product practical performance and the following representative technology analysis will explain the mechanism of how they impact on customer. Finally, the modeling works as the tool to test the significance between representative technology and customer adoption by forecasting the battery electric vehicle diffusion in Sweden. 5.1 Customer Analysis The analysis in this section is trying to figure out the pattern based on the information gathered from previous research, customer, product supplier as well as technology specialist. Customer expectation is a result of previous technology performance perception as well as the foundation for future adoption decision. Thus, it would be interesting to compare it with BEV’s practical performance. As identified before, several criteria are the most frequently cited factors that impact on the customer adoption on positive or negative way. Among all, the low awareness issue is important but can neither be defined as a customer demand nor be comparable with product performance. It is more about the external evaluation for customer knowledge and related to market effort like advertising and promotion. Therefore, the range, TCO benefit, safety and technology reliability, better driving experience and environmentally friendly have been selected. Focus on these five dimensions; we are able to draw out the comparable relationship between customer expectation when it comes to the purchasing decision and BEV’s practical work. More specifically, the customer expectation can be easily extracted from the three perspectives empirical findings about customer critical demand combined with the literature study of BEV adoption (refer to chapter 2.1.4 & 2.1.5). It is obvious that the ‘Range’ is the biggest concern for both early adopter and non-user while the ‘better driving experience’ trait of BEV has not been perceived well. And the level of technology was positioned based on the analysis result of customer expectation integrated with discrete information from interviews as well as literature study about the scientific fact. It is rather a comparison result focused on the difference than a solely positioning work. Such as the EV manager stated TCO of battery car is an advantage rather than disadvantage, which make the performance of this dimension a little bit higher than the customer perspective. Considering previous study (2.1.5), comparison of BEV and non-BEV user regarding the range issue, and the interviewee A’s statement about the average range performance of BEV can serve most of real driving demand but hardly meet the expectation. It indicates that this dimension would be relative lower. As showed below, a radar chart has been developed to illustrate the difference between customer expectation and practical performance. The number from 1 to 5 represents the expectation level from low to high regarding customer expectation as well as the BEV’s practical capability. Both the customer and BEV in the chart are summarized in general without division into sub-category. Be aware that the chart is being used for illustrating the contrastive relationship rather than concise quantitative evaluation. 48 Figure 5-1 the radar chart of customer expectation and practical performance (Proprietary analysis) To read the chart separately, we can get the basic picture of customer demand and the current BEV property respectively. It is more interesting to analysis the difference between each dimension by comparison. The reason for causing these gaps can be draw out from the empirical and literature work presented above. Higher Practical Performance As we can see, the environmental friendly and better driving experiences are the two dimensions where the BEV practical performance exceeds the customer expectation. It implicates that these two factors are considered to be relative advantages from customer’s perception of electric vehicle. It is a positive variable drive the rate of adoption according to Rogers’ theory, but it seems to be not well received. The environmentally friendly is the attribute that BEV has already been achieved on almost the highest level, but customer’s expectation or demand for a green car is not comparable. Only the people who are concise about emission or fuel scarcity issue might pay attention to this attributes and part of those people has become early adopters. The better driving experience (e.g. quick acceleration and the quiet engine) compared to regular car is part of driving force as well. But it is perceived by even smaller fraction of people according to the customer analysis. Since the driving experience still has large potential to increased, the position of this dimension is much lower than the environmental performance. Once the driving experience get developed in the overall automotive industry, it is very possible to assume the standard of this dimension will get stricter. Higher Customer Expectation For those who already well received the relative advantage of BEV, the reason for not becoming an early adaptor is the huge dissatisfaction of the rest of dimensions. These factors can not only be considered as the relative advantage of existing product, but also represent the potential directions that electric vehicle as an innovation should be improved. 49 The gap is the combined result of technology limitations and the mental deviation of perception. The technology limitation we discussed is not only the practical capability of one technology, but also the limitations affect the perception of technology according to specialist interviews. As we learnt from those interviews, several promising technology projects are going on in parallel to address each of those unsatisfied customer expectation. We also learnt that there were some restrictions that limited the perception by customer as mentioned above. The mental deviation exists in all these three dimensions. From both the previous study and our customer survey reveal the same fact that customers expect much more range than they need when it comes to battery vehicle. And according the EV manger’s calculation, the TCO of battery car is 11% lower than a regular car in general. Even the supplier aspect of opinion has certain bias, it can still reflect that people might not fully perceive the TCO benefit but pay too much attention on initial cost. From our customer survey, the BEV users are more sensitive with safety and are very satisfied. It reflects that the non-BEV user’ concern about safety and technology reliability is not completely objective. Implication The development of technology always intends to have positive impact on customer adoption, but the customer doesn't seem to perceive and accept this effort in a direct way. On one hand, people can hardly have very objective and accurate expectation based on their real need, especially for a new product. On the other hand, there are lots of limitations that weaken the technology’s observability or compatibility. Thus, the ‘urgent’ technology customer demand or ‘visible’ technology customer can perceive could have relative more impact on customer adoption. 5.2 The Representative Technology 5.2.1 The Selection of Representative Technology In order to illustrate the mechanism of technology influence, this thesis will choose two technologies to analyze. Due to the thesis’ delimitations and the applicability to the model, the technology we choose followed the rules as followed: 1) The development of the technology leads to the higher performance which matches the customer demand. 2) Technologies are possible to implement in the near future. 3) The technologies are relatively independent. 4) The historical data within the selected scope of time is available to access and study With all these criteria being considered, the Battery Management System and Lithium Battery Energy Density are decided to be analyzed. And these two technologies are representative because both of them have a great impact on some of the customer high ranking demand. Besides that, Tesla, as the electric vehicle leader in the market, has multiple patents about BMS which are considered as the core competitiveness of this company. And the battery they use is well known as its high energy density. Therefore, BMS and lithium battery energy density are the proper technologies in the analysis. In the Bass model, current market effort is considered as we mentioned above. Actually, the market effort involved a factor of customer perception. For example, cost variation has less impact on low price 50 sensitivity people. In other words, the effort of reducing cost gets less effect among people who don’t care much about the money. Technology, as one important perception factor, should be in consider when discuss the current market effort. Similar opinions are also expressed in the survey. Some potential customers showed their willingness to buy BEV as long as the technology performance meets their expectation. 5.2.2 The Battery Density The battery energy density reflects the capability of energy stored in a given weight battery. Higher battery energy density, on one hand, provides more energy source to an electric vehicle, on the other hand, reduce the total weight of the vehicle. Energy density development meets the need of range as well as environmental concern. The battery energy density stands for one of the most efficient method to increase the range of electric vehicle with sustainability. The performance of this technology can be easily interpreted as the increasing number of range or the decreasing number of vehicle weight. Therefore, it is very easy for customer to understand and perceive. 5.2.3 The Battery Management System BMS is capable to feed customers’ top ranking demand to some extent. As we mentioned before, BMS provided a safety protection function which allows more batteries in the battery pack without increasing the risk. Thermal control and cell balancing functions guarantee the battery performance being stable. This will certainly raise the range performance of electric vehicle. What’s more, battery charging and discharging control function protect the battery pack from internal damage. This function prolongs the battery life and lowers the TCO to some extent. Also, safety and reliability are achieved since BMS have functions that can lower the risk of battery fire or electric leakage in some extreme scenarios such as crash. BMS development is also easy to understand and precept by customers because it have a result of range growth. However, as identified above, the safety and battery protection function especially function for extreme scenarios draws less attention. And increasing electric vehicle range by implementing more batteries in one vehicle which will enhance the overall vehicle weight is not sustainable. 5.3 Modeling the BEV diffusion considering representative technology impact This section is a combination study of qualitative analysis (of product, customer, market condition, adoption factors) and quantitative analysis (calculate the future adoption rate based on the regression of historical data and assumption of future scenarios). The modified GBM works as the tool to test the relationship between representative technology and customer adoption mathematically. To be aware that it is a study concentrate more on the relative relationship between different variables instead of the accurate number of forecast. One of the major assumptions of Bass model is that it considers only the initial purchase of a new product. The diffusion of BEV in Sweden is applicable because the introduction of BEV in Sweden took place from 2011 and the lifespan for its automotive batteries last approximately eight to ten years. We can safely assume that there will not be considerable replacement purchase in our focused period of time. 51 5.3.1 Model Modification The modification is based on the GBM, where the so called “carryover effects” 𝑥(𝑑) contains two lagged decision variables pricing and advertising, recall the mathematical definition: Bass and other researchers modified different decision variables according to different data need. Such as the study conducted by Evans et al. (2006) has modified the decision variables to be ‘saving’, ‘pricing’ and ‘advertising’ for analyzing how different fiscal policy impact on the diffusion of renewable energy technology in the United States. In the research, they redefined these three decision variables to their specific need, the ‘saving’ is the financial benefits of the renewable energy not directly including the price (e.g. tax rebate, annual tax saving, etc.). Similar in this study, we modified the GBM by analyzing the (potential) adopter’s characteristic and need, considering the two representative technology development we selected, we redefined three major decision variables: ‘total cost ownership’, ‘the perception of energy density performance’ and ‘the perception of BMS performance’ under our own interpretation. The choice of these three variables is the result of the customer analysis under the consideration of research purpose. Since the x(t) is kind of time-dependent ‘carryover effect’ which have potential to impact on the adoption throughout the process, we assume the variable which have impact on narrowing the gap between customer expectation and practical performance have the potential to affect the adoption rate most. Considering the purpose of this modeling study, we choose to not only consider the two representative technologies which have potential to narrow the gap but also include the decision variable for one critical demand – TCO. The TCO is an adjusted concept for formal ‘price’ variable while the representative technology as decision variables are new introduced, so we should provide our own definition under this research context to avoid ambiguity. Total cost ownership (TCO): is the total cost cover the life-span of the battery car, using the same definition presented in previous chapter. Perception of energy density: customer’s perception of the practical influence of battery car performance that the energy density development leaded to. Perception of BMS: customer’s perception of the practical influence of battery car performance that the BMS development leaded to. After the modification, the adjusted carryover effects 𝑥(𝑑) can be formulated as: 𝑥(𝑑) = 1 + � ∆𝑃𝑃(𝑡) 𝑃𝑃(𝑡−1) − ∆𝑃𝑃(𝑡) 𝑃𝑃(𝑡−1)�𝛽𝑇𝑇𝑇 + � ∆𝐸𝐸(𝑡) 𝐸𝐸(𝑡−1)�𝛽𝐸𝐸 + � ∆𝐵𝐵𝐵(𝑡) 𝐵𝐵𝐵(𝑡−1)�𝛽𝐵𝐵𝐵 (6) where the 𝛽𝑇𝑇𝑇, 𝛽𝐸𝐸, and 𝛽𝐵𝐵𝐵 are the weight for the total cost ownership, the perception of energy density and the perception of BMS, respectively. Different variable data has been chosen considering data representativeness and the feasibility of data collection. Pv refers to the relative price of vehicle, equal to the ratio of BEV price to similar ICE at time t, thus Pv = the price of BEV/the price of ICE at time t Pg = the price of gasoline at time t 52 ED = the best technology level of Energy Density at time t BMS = the cumulative BMS utility patent at time t Considering the reality of customer reaction to different variables, we expect the increasing of Pv and the decreasing of Pg will have negative impact on the adoption, which leads to negative 𝛽𝑇𝑇𝑇, while we assume the customer will be more satisfied when perceived the changes by Energy Density or BMS development, the 𝛽𝐸𝐸, and 𝛽𝐵𝐵𝐵 are supposed to be positive. 5.3.2 Determining Coefficients The application of the model is to build a specific simulation model with coefficients dedicated to Swedish BEV diffusion in order to provide insight as to the effects of technology development on the market penetration through affecting adopter’s decision. Data preparation One of the greatest difficulties when applying the model to a real problem is that no sufficient data available for the model parameters estimation because the forecasting usually target to a new introduced product in the market. According to relevant research, the method of analogy is a valid and common used way to determine the coefficients. It requires the researcher to select and collect data from an analogous product (Kong and Bi, 2014). For this reason, we used the Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) as the analogy product and collected its data in American market. This very selection has been proved to be valid enough for other GBM application about fuel cell vehicle and electric vehicle (Park, Kim and Lee, 2011; REN et al., 2012; Kong and Bi, 2014). The scope of time for historical data varied from 9 to 15 years in previous studies, so here we choose the time period from 2000 to 2013 since HEV was first introduced in 2000. Accordingly, a series of consistent data has been carefully collected for model application. Historical Sales of Hybrid Electric Vehicles: We use the HEV annual sales in America (Block and Harrison, 2014) from 2000-2013 as the historical sales data, stand for Y(T) in the equation. Vehicle Price: In a similar study conducted by Park et al. (2011), suggests using the Toyota Prius and Toyota Corolla as the typical hybrid electric car and similar ICE car to compare. They are ideally representative because the Prius has been the best-selling HEV since it entered the U.S. market while the Corolla belongs to the same sub-segment of passenger car market and both of them are produced from the same Toyota 330N platform. The selected pricing data is the average Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price of the Toyota Prius and Corolla models each year over this period (CarGurus, 2015). Gasoline price: Gasoline as one of the most popular automotive fuels, we use its price (dollars per gallon) to present the EV’s alternative energy source price (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2015) Battery Energy Density: The timing energy density [Wh/l] of the Panasonic 18650 Li-ion cell has been chosen as the representative for the Li-ion battery energy density development. Data gathered from: (Straubel, 2014; 53 Panasonic website). It is one of the common used Lithium batteries in electric vehicle (e.g. Tesla passenger car) in the world and has been developed very actively during these years. BMS technology development: The cumulative number of utility patent related to BMS could be considered as the analogy of the development level of battery management system technology. Data gathered from: (Google.com, 2015) All the prepared data has been displayed in the table below: Year Annual Sales of HEV Prius (USD) Corolla (USD) Gasoline price (USD) Energy Density [Wh/l] Number of Cumulative BMS Parents 2000 9350 19258 13986 1.51 390 154 2001 20282 19995 13366 1.461 450 202 2002 36035 20480 13370 1.358 450 247 2003 47600 20480 14740 1.591 490 277 2004 84199 20810 14837 1.88 490 305 2005 209711 21815 15828 2.295 525 328 2006 252636 22345 16833 2.589 580 357 2007 352274 23243 16477 2.801 580 379 2008 312386 22165 15690 3.266 620 406 2009 290271 23215 17550 2.35 620 439 2010 274210 25454 17670 2.788 620 480 2011 268755 25254 17633 3.527 620 534 2012 434645 26124 17897 3.644 730 596 2013 495530 26324 19080 3.526 735 672 Regression Analysis In terms of optimization algorithms to regress more than two coefficients, the genetic algorithms and ant colony algorithm are increasingly applied in the innovation diffusion. Venkatesan and Kumar (2002) believe that the parameter estimation result of genetic algorithm is better than other methods. Since this case is a non-linear which contains 6 coefficients, we used genetic algorithms as the regression method in the coefficient calculation. Before operating the genetic algorithm programme with our data, we tested the programme’s accuracy by using data from another BEV diffusion research (REN et al., 2012) and get similar regression result 54 with much higher coefficient of determination (R2= 0.97). Since the coefficient of determination ranges from 0 to 1represents the percent of the data that is the closest to the line of best fit, it proves that the genetic algorithm programme we designed is able to get relative valid and reliable result for solving GBM equation. The result of regression analysis is: 𝑅2 m p q 𝛽𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝛽𝐸𝐸 𝛽𝐵𝐵𝐵 0.8513 6691999 0.0069 0.2269 -0.3140 0.6025 0.3508 The line graph below illustrates the actual sales (S (t), blue line) and sales predicted (S (t)*, red line) by regression. Figure 5-2 the actual sales and sales predicted by regression The coefficient of determination is 0.85, which means the regression result fit the actual data to 85%. It proved the result is reliable enough. It is relative low, comparing with the regression result in the introduction paper of the GBM (𝑅2 range from 0.86 to 0.99). And we think this reasonable deviation could be the result of the economic crisis to some extent. The coefficient of innovator turn out to be much smaller than the coefficient of imitator (even smaller than the average 0.001 suggested from previous study), it implies the technology of EV is hard to be accepted at the beginning, especially when no word of mouth effect happen. But along with the adoption, the imitator will be more and more easily encouraged (refer to figure 2-8). Also, the coefficient of imitation is also below the average (q=0.38) suggested by Mahajan, Muller and Bass (1995). It is also reasonable since the average number is from the result of original bass model application case, without the considering of time-dependent change of q. According to the sign of different weight of variables, the slop of adoption will increase with the decreasing initial cost; increasing gasoline price; rising of energy density and the development of battery management system to different level ( in proportion to the absolute number of the β). Coefficient Calibration As Bass suggested for the no-data case or the limited-data case in general, it would be possible for researcher to make plausible guesses of the parameters. The analysis of the potential market and the 55 buying motives should make it plausible to guess at the size of the market (m), and to the relative values of p & q. While the latter guess should be determined by considering buying motives (Bass, 1969). Therefore, several calibrations for different coefficient have been made to the calibrated result of different parameter according to the Swedish market and customer analysis above. Especially when no renewable energy technology has ever penetrated a market completely, calibrating these adjustments would be essentially guesswork. m - The potential number of adopters of the new product For renewable energy technology, it is desirable to be able to examine scenarios where an m value is mandated by the government, in other words, it is better to keep m as an input, rather than an output (Evans et al., 2006). As Bass, Trichnan, and Jain stated (1994) “when no data are available for estimation, it is probably intuitively more feasible than guesses about the influence of decision variables on m”. In our case, the estimation of m in Sweden is based on a projection made by The Swedish Energy Agency states that there will be proximately 480,000 electric vehicles (BEV and PHEV) in the Swedish passenger car fleet by 2030 under current control measures (The Swedish Energy Agency, 2009). Even the number combined BEV and PHEV, according to the fossil free goal by 2050, the diffusion of EV will last for at least 20 years more. Thus, we assume the potential number of adopter of BEV to be 480,000. Be aware that, this rough assumption is to give a stationary number for market penetration application, so the high level accuracy is not a requirement. p - The coefficient of innovation According to the adopter categorization by Rogers (1983), the innovators are a very small segment in the market. Furthermore, they play a rather limited role in diffusing the innovation to other segments. The imitators, in contrast, play the major role in diffusion of innovations in the marketplace and are a substantially larger segment. We therefore believe that for cross-country analysis, the coefficient of imitation will represent cross-country differences more clearly and distinctly than the coefficient of innovation (Takada and Jain, 1991). q - The coefficient of imitation The market context in literature review states that Swedish people have higher environmental awareness compared with other countries’. Morel and Kwakye’s (2012) investigation also concluded the Swedish are more sensitive to eco-friendly product regarding purchase intention compared with non- Swedish. We can safely assume the coefficient of imitation is higher for Swedish customer. 𝜷 - The weight of decision variables One assumption for a GBM model is when the model is accurate representation, the weight of the decision variables, ought to be nearly the same for a given product across different market segments, even across different policy environment (Evans et al., 2006). Thus, the calibration for the weight of decision variables only depends on the difference between HEV and BEV. Since the cost of these two kinds of vehicle is quite similar compare to regular car, we suppose the 𝛽𝑇𝑇𝑇 remain the same for our model. And because the battery and the management system technology cover much more percent of BEV than HEV, the 𝛽𝐸𝐸 and 𝛽𝐵𝐵𝐵 should be increased at least 25% conservatively. 56 The calibrated coefficients are showed as below: m p q 𝛽𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝛽𝐸𝐸 𝛽𝐵𝐵𝐵 480,000 0.0069 0.283615 -0.313980 0.753146 0.447548 Substitute these determined coefficients into equation (4) and (6), the annual sales 𝑆(𝑇) can be calculated by the equation as follow: 𝑆(𝑇) = {0.0069[480000 − 𝑌(𝑇)] + (0.283615/480000)𝑌(𝑇)[480000 − 𝑌(𝑑)]} ∗ �1 − 0.31398 � ∆𝑃𝐴(𝑑) 𝑃𝐴(𝑑 − 1) − ∆𝑃𝑃(𝑑) 𝑃𝑃(𝑑 − 1) �+ 0.753146 � ∆𝐸𝐸(𝑑) 𝐸𝐸(𝑑 − 1) � + 0.447548 � ∆𝐵𝐵𝑆(𝑑) 𝐵𝐵𝑆(𝑑 − 1) �� 5.4 The BEV Diffusion under Different Scenarios In order to differentiate the technology influence only, control variable method is chosen to be used. For each technology, we assume there will be 3 scenarios in the future: no development (stagnant), develop smoothly (increase at half of the annually historical increasing rate) and development takes off (increase at twice of the annually historical increasing rate). In the analysis, the price gap is assumed to remains the same. The stagnant scenario presents exactly the same results with the original bass model’s (figure 5-3) since all the variables equals to zero. For the forecasting under different scenarios, the time period 2015-2025 has been highlighted considering the validity would be relative weak after this decade. 5.4.1 Result This diagram shows the results of the bass diffusion model without external variables. Figure 5-3 BEV diffusion in Sweden forecast without external variables (original bass model) Figure 5-4 shows the diffusion of electric vehicle in consider of different technology development scenario of battery energy density. 57 Figure 5-4 the diffusion result under three energy density scenarios Figure 5-5 shows the diffusion of electric vehicle in consider of different technology development scenario of battery management system. Figure 5-5 the diffusion result under three BMS scenarios Figure 5-6 shows the diffusion of electric vehicle in considers of different technology development scenario of both energy density and BMS. Figure 5-6 the diffusion result under three BMS & Energy Density scenarios 5.4.2 Result Analysis In the previous qualitative analysis, mechanism of how technology impact on customer adoption has already been described, especially for the case of lithium battery energy density and battery management system. Mathematically, the result above tests the fact that taking technologies perception into consideration would lead to a different diffusion effect. Generally, the technology development will accelerate the diffusion process. With higher development speed, the diffusion process tends to be faster. 58 Under the same total number of adopters as assumed, the diffusion peak is brought forward as it showed in both diagram 5-4 and 5-5. There will be a roughly 2-years gap between technology developments takes off and technology development not being considered. The gap tends to be larger when 2 technologies are both considered as showed in diagram 5-6. However, the gap won’t be unlimited if more technologies are being used into the calculation. Because when more technologies are considered in the model, their weight of decision variables (ß) would be relatively smaller. Moreover, the diffusion peak is proved to be higher than what the original GBM will predict. And certainly the sales will be higher along with technology development in the early stage. And after the peak year, the sales decreased relatively sharply due to the market saturation. By comparing diagram 5-4 with 5-5, the results shows that energy density will promote the diffusion more significantly than BMS in both scenarios. This is caused by their weight differences. The difference between figure 5-4 and figure 5-5 illustrate that a higher promotion of the product is gained if the development of a technology can be perceived to covers more demand. In summary, explained from the meaning of the generalized bass model, the customer perception of lithium battery energy density (or battery management system) change along with the development of the technology, which effect on the demand of the product during the time period. Beyond the established scenarios, as we know the technology would not always develop at the same rate, thus the real adoption will not be as smooth as the diagram illustrate. Also, the emerging of a radical or revolutionary change will lead to significant fluctuation which will be discussed in the next chapter. 59 6. Conclusion and Discussion This final chapter is the overall summary of the whole research. A brief conclusion will be presented to recap the main findings at the beginning, and the critical analysis, limitation discussion and contribution summary are following. The last section provides several future research suggestions based on the limitation and delimitation of this study. 6.1 Conclusion The overall research has been conducted under the purpose of providing logical analysis and modeling about how the customer decision towards battery electric vehicle would be affected along with certain technology change. The main research question ‘How does technology development impact customer adoption of battery electric vehicle?’ can be answered briefly as: the BEV-related technology, which have potential ability to address critical customer demand, are able to impact on the customer adoption positively through valid perception by customer. The answer is concluded and supported from the finding result of the following qualitative and quantitative study. The logical analysis has been conducted in a qualitative approach in order to answer what are the customer expectations towards BEV, correlated with the practical performance of technology? By analysing the information gathered from three perspective empirical work compare with previous study. We identify that target Swedish customers are in favor of new technology and relatively more sensitive to eco-friendly product which indicates a promising BEV market in future. However, we find out the early adopters are certain group of people with very common characteristics and demand. In order to reach the mass market, several critical issues which hinder the purchasing should be addressed; most of the issues can be solved by different technology development effort, except low awareness. Regarding the three most significant concerns: range anxiety, total cost of ownership (especially initial cost) and safety and reliability, there are lots of technology development working from past to the future to improve. Even the battery cars are able to reach the certain real need of a passenger car user, the significant gap still existing between customer expectation and its practical performance which lead to the critical demands. We identify the gap as a result of technology limitation and the mental deviation of perception. The model based study was finalized in a combination of quantitative and qualitative way, using the qualitative analysis result as input. For the purpose of the study, the customer perception of technology has been taken into account as decision variables in the modified Generalized Bass model dedicated to Swedish BEV market. Firstly, a general forecast about BEV diffusion in Sweden is able to be developed under fixed potential market size. Furthermore, for testing the technology perception variables, two representative technologies have been chosen considering their continuously development and high potential to address critical demand. Both the modeling result of lithium battery energy density and battery management system validated their acceleration impact on customer adoption to different extent. 60 6.2 Discussion 6.2.1 Limitation of the study We proposed a new variable into Generalized Bass Model to interpret how technology has an impact on product diffusion. It is important to reflect whether this model’s limitation has or has not affected the results of this study. Bass diffusion model is very suitable in our case as we mentioned in the earlier chapter. But it also has some limitations. Firstly, the model indicates the sales number from the customer side instead of the manufacturer side. It may not be able to reflect the 2nd purchase and inventory in the sales chain. Secondly, the product definition in bass model is static, which means the product should stay at least similar. Finally, the model could be affected by the unexpected factors, for example, financial crisis. Furthermore, there might be some pitfalls about usage of regression analysis. In this thesis, we used historical data to get the coefficients by regression analysis. In the result, the coefficient of determination R 2 which indicates the significant level is 85.13%. This is relatively high but still the accuracy of the results is affected. The coefficients could vary in certain range meanwhile the equation still make sense. The main reasons in this case could be lack of enough data and unusual data in the year of 2008 and 2009 in which a global financial crisis happened. Also, in order to get more accurate results in the future work, there are some underlying assumptions needs to be mentioned and highlighted. Firstly, due to there is lack of historical sales data of electric vehicles, this thesis assumed BEV is very similar to HEV. Therefore, HEV’s data instead of BEV’s is used to analyze. Secondly, this thesis has an assumption that the electric vehicles will be diffused as the Swedish government suggested. But there is still a chance that the BEV will not survive in the market. Finally, in this thesis, second purchase is not considered as mentioned above. It could be a minor question since the thesis only focus on next decade meanwhile the lifespan of an electric vehicle is considered as nearly a decade according to Nissan and Tesla’s warranty. But still this will lose some accuracy in the model results especially after 2025. However, these limitations did not influence the validity much. In the delimitation chapter, we highlighted that the next decade is our concern. The researchers believed that within 10 years, there can be little change in electric vehicle and very few 2nd purchase. This means the limitation of bass model will not challenge the conclusion. Additionally, our research question focus on ‘how technology as a variable impact customer adoption of electric vehicle’ which is about mechanism rather than ‘how much technology as a variable can impact customer adoption of electric vehicle’ which is about accuracy. Therefore, the validity is relatively high in consideration of these limitations. 6.2.2 Validity and Reliability Validity Collis and Hussey (2009) defined validity as a concept to describe how well a test measures the phenomenon it is supposed to measure. In this thesis, the data we gathered is mainly qualitative and subjective. Moreover, the survey was partly distributed to certain group of people instead of random people. Therefore, the primary data which was used in this thesis may reduce the validity because of the subjectivity of the interviewees and the possible inaccurate interpretation of the researchers. Also, bias is inevitable in the survey result. 61 However, as researchers, we gathered data from different players in the market and always criticized which degree the data from the interview is bias since people tend to defend what they are doing or what they believe in. Besides that, we have discussed the possible reasons why different opinions towards the same thing presented from different perspectives. Therefore, opinions and data are evaluated by comparing to each other in the analysis to increase the validity. In addition, 2 researchers’ working together avoids the researchers’ bias as well as subjectivity of the interpretation to some extent. Reliability Reliability reflects the “absence of differences in the results if the research was repeated”, according to Collis and Hussey (2009). The reliability of this thesis is relatively high since the thesis data roughly matches the 2 key factors for increasing the reliability: transparency and replication (Gibbert and Ruigrok, 2012). However, there are also some factors that may lower the reliability of this thesis. The data is not fully presented in this thesis and the interviewees are kept anonymous. But we considered it as a minor problem because basically interviews are impossible to 100% presented in any academic thesis and in this thesis interviewees agreed us to use their title which can easily lead to their names. Moreover, the survey we conducted was not randomly distributed. This lowers the reliability because it is hard to find the same group of people if the research is repeated. But in this thesis, we used the survey results mainly as the qualitative data. This means the survey only focus on the broader image instead of individual opinions. What’s more, in order to test the validity of the collected data by comparing results, several survey questions are developed from previous valid questionnaire intentionally. The empirical findings chapter show the information collected through our survey are quite in line with previous study with reasonable deviation. Talking about innovation diffusion research in particular, Rogers (2003) summarized 4 critical issues that will affect the validity and reliability. Check the research issue by issue, none of the pro-innovation bias, individual-blame bias, or recall problem existed in this study. However, we overlooked the issue of equality in the diffusion of innovation. But we believe the adoption rate of electric vehicle is not big enough to widen the socioeconomic gaps (socioeconomic status may influence understanding of science) among customers too much. 6.2.3 Contribution Academically, this thesis contributes a new insight of electric vehicle diffusion. Unlike most previous literature, we studied electric vehicle diffusion from technology perspective instead of from political and financial angle. And a further discussion about how customer perceives the technology performance indicates a fact that the related technology development could accelerate the diffusion process at a different speed. A radar chart has been developed (figure 5-1) to summarize the relationship between customer expectation and practical performance. It can be used as a tool for similar researches in the future. We also implemented new decision variables into generalized bass model to test our focused variables and then calibrated it to the Swedish market. It implicates an alternative application which can be generalized to other factors study in innovation diffusion. Besides academic contribution, we also provided a series of empirical findings in this thesis. A survey we had conducted in Sweden showed a basic image of customer demand in Sweden. Additionally, the 62 survey also gave evidences of BEV awareness and driving habits. The semi-structure interviews for technology specialist and BEV provider also contributes the complementary insight of our topic. This thesis showed an approach to illustrate the possible diffusion process under different scenarios. Since product development cost mass resources especially in automotive industry, the thesis can be regarded as a reference for BEV manufacturers’ decision-making, in the aspect of funding the R&D, developing new vehicle model and recruiting new employees in their electric vehicles department etc. 6.3 Future Research Suggestion In order to get even more reliable result, the future research suggestions are mostly for extending our limitation and delimitation. Firstly, it is encouraged to conduct further customer study basic on the result of this research, regarding their dynamic and complexity. - To analysis the changes of the relationship between customer expectation and practical performance in the future. - Based on the result of this research, to conduct another customer survey by narrowing down the focus on the identified critical issues and elaborating the analysis. Secondly, since there are only two representative technologies have been tested for one product, it is recommended to test more representative technologies or products. - Choose and test more representative technologies apart from Energy Density and BMS, and to compare the relationship and pattern among them. The result could be valuable to develop future technology research strategy towards electric vehicle. Further analysis the competitive relationship between electric vehicle and alternative technology, such as PHEV and FCV. - The developed diffusion model is plausible to test the other external factors for electric vehicle or for other similar product. It require necessary redefinition of decision variables, formula updated equation and gather reliable historical data For researcher who intends to conduct an accurate market forecast of electric vehicle, we suggest to consider independent external variables as much as possible (e.g. infrastructure, advertising), use the genetic algorithm to filter non-significant variables (the one with small weight 𝛽). It is also important to set up more plausible future scenarios by considering society, economic, technology and policy tendency. 63 7. Reference Accenture, 2011.

What is your responsibility in the organization? ● Could you briefly talk about your experience related to electromobility: both academic research and empirical work (elaborate more about your experience in XXX) Part two: Positioning BEV in the world/Sweden market ● From your point of view, how likely do you think that BEV will become the majority or an important part in EU market in 10 years? ● If we narrow it down to the Swedish market, will you have the same answer? Why? ● What character does BEV have that makes you feel BEV have a strong competitive edge compared with other mobility? Part three: Customer level ● What do you think are the key forces that leading current customer adoption for BEV? ● What are the critical issues which may hinder the customer adoption? ● Are these factors the same 10 years ago? What makes these differences? Part four: Technological level ● What are the most promising technologies/ fields of study that you believe have the power to reshape the BEV market? And how? ● Regarding the Identified driving and restraining factors of BEV on customer level (brief summarize) which technology is dominant/have the greatest impact on them or could probably have in the upcoming decade? For each of the technology: ● The path of its influence? ● What limit/accelerate the development of this technology now and in future? ● Could you also talk about your field of study’s influence on customer level? ● Will there be a technology revolution / radical innovation in the upcoming decade? how? Backup question: ● Do you think there is still unexplored field of research about BEV technology which have great potential that worth future researchers to pay attention to? ● Do you see there will be a technology revolution (or radical technology change) in BEV (or in the field of your research)? Why? Part five: Swedish Market characteristic ● What is the unique characteristic of Swedish market? ● Which market is the most similar one to benchmark? ● What’s your attitude towards the Swedish government target in 2030 regarding the adoption of BEV, and why? ○ EV City by 2030 / Fossil fuel free by 2040 71 ● How do you understand the fact that Sweden is now lag behind Norway and Netherland regarding BEV adoption? ● Under which technology (or vehicle attribute) condition, do you believe BEV is mature enough to compete in the free market without regulatory support? 72 Appendix 3 Selected Part of Survey (Result) Questions for All Participants Questions for BEV users 73 Do you have any expectation for future Battery Electric Vehicle? • More charge points and faster to charge • The main problem is range in winter. 150km in summer becomes 50km in winter. This is a problem. 150km is perfectly fine while 50 is not. Especially with slow onboard chargers and missing high Power charging places. • Larger batteries, faster charging, extended range. • Longer range, preferably > 300 km. Ability to tow a trailer. Wider selection of models. Never more than a \"1/4 charge\" distance to the nearest quick charge station. (Today we have to use the fossil car for holidays and longer trips, and because of lack of quick charge stations we also need to keep two cars) • Longer driving range even in winter time • Lower purchase price and more range • Higher endurance, lower purchase price, common charging networks with normal prices and easy payments without membership demands • Higher range, more environmental friendly production and lower purchase price 74 • That the battery capacity will be even better and that we get more stations where we can recharge the battery. I would also like to see that the policymakers decided for better subsidies so the initial costs for the BEV's went down. • Good Economy Low emissions Low sound while driving Fun to drive • Better batteries Smartnet integration • Electrified roads for a possibility to have cheaper cars with longer range. • More options in different price ranges. This is the future not a question if but when everyone is driving an electric car. • Longer range, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, self-driving. • Longer range, 300 km + Fast charging infrastructure established making intra city travel possible/convenient Destination charging infrastructure established at workplaces, city centers, shopping areas etc. Questions for non-BEV users 75","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
