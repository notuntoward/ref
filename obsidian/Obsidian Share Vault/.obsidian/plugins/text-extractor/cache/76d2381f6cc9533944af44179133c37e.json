Besides the positive effects on the environment and on renewable technology development, the deployment policies for these technologies have also had negative consequences. For example, these policies have led to high economic costs and have partially endangered technological diversity by inadvertently locking out technological options that were not commercially competitive at the time of policy introduction. Yet above all, the high shares of intermittent and non-deterministic RETs (e.g., wind and solar power generation), which resulted from these policies, may challenge power security and quality. Of the technical options to address the intermittency resulting from high shares of RETs, stationary electricity storage (SES) – with its ability to decouple energy generation and consumption over time – is one of the most promising alternatives. In fact, policy schemes aiming to support the diffusion of SES have recently been implemented across several countries. The present dissertation aims to improve the understanding of how policy makers can support the diffusion of SES technologies by taking into account the characteristics of these technologies. In contrast to most RETs, SES technologies can create value in very different ways and for different stakeholders in the energy system, making them technologies that can serve multiple, distinct applications (i.e., multi-purpose technologies). This multi-purpose character is highly relevant for policy makers since it adds an additional dimension (i.e., the applications of a technology) to the question of how to support these kinds of technologies. While this dimension offers policy makers additional degrees of freedom, the implications for the optimal design and implementation of deployment policies for multi-purpose technologies are unclear from both a practical and theoretical point of view. To address this gap, while incorporating the experience with deployment policies for RETs, the present dissertation employs the example of SES in order to investigate the following research question: How can policy makers support the deployment of multi-purpose technologies while limiting the costs of support policies and maintaining technological diversity? In order to examine this research question, this dissertation builds upon and combines insights from the literature on innovation and evolutionary theory as well as from energy economics. To this end, it employs techno-economic simulation tools and regression analyses of patent data. Four papers are included in this dissertation, two of which focus on the costs of deployment policies and two focus on deployment policies and technological diversity. Specifically, the first paper investigates the life-cycle costs of several SES technologies - which impact the costs of deployment policies – across energy system applications, highlighting the high costs of SES in general as well as the strong variation in costs across applications. The second paper builds upon this finding on the technology level by iii incorporating the value of the applications served in the energy market. Based on the resulting profitability assessment, and taking into account the multi-purpose character of SES, this paper develops a strategy for policy makers to implement efficient deployment policies. With respect to the link between deployment policies and technological diversity, the third paper analyzes the determinants of knowledge diffusion within and across SES technologies (i.e., the determinants of the direction of knowledge flows). A main result of this paper is the limited amount of inter-technology spillovers in general, and more specifically, the limited amount of inter-technology spillovers between specialized knowledge on core parts of a technology which increases the risk of a lock-in through deployment policies. In response to this finding, the fourth paper investigates the degree of competition among SES technologies holistically in order to derive implications for a deployment policy for multi-purpose technologies that minimizes the risk of a technological lock-in. Several implications relevant to policy makers result from these findings. This dissertation shows that, in the case of multi-purpose technologies, policy makers can reduce the costs of deployment policies by sequentially supporting applications based on their profitability. Moreover, policy makers can avoid a premature lock-in into one technology by supporting applications with a high degree of competition among technologies or by adapting the specificity of deployment policies with respect to their targeted applications and technologies. Furthermore, policy support schemes that are likely to generate specialized and core knowledge can accelerate the development of existing technologies along established trajectories. Contrariwise, fostering activities that are likely to generate diversified and peripheral knowledge has the potential to increase technological diversity due to more inter- technology knowledge spillovers. This dissertation contributes to the extant literature in multiple ways. Theoretical contributions result from the definition and discussion of the concept of multi-purpose technologies as well as from the introduction of the application perspective in the lock-in literature. A further theoretical contribution lies in the, to the author’s knowledge, first study on the determinants of direction of technological knowledge flows, which is able to resolve inconclusive evidence of prior research and bridges the hitherto distinct literature streams of knowledge diffusion and product architecture. Methodological contributions include a heuristic to value SES technologies in the market, an indicator to assess the risk of lock-in through deployment policies, and the operationalization of the centrality of knowledge through the product architecture. Empirical contributions mainly comprise data and information on the emerging technological field of SES. In particular, this dissertation comprehensively assesses the costs and economic values of several SES technologies as well as presents a novel framework to define SES applications. iv Zusammenfassung Viele Länder haben in den letzten Jahren den Einsatz von erneuerbaren Energietechnologien (EE) gefördert um den steigenden Energiebedarf zu decken und gleichzeitig den CO2-Ausstoß sowie die Abhängigkeit von fossilen Energiequellen zu verringern. Diese Förderungsmaßnahmen („Nachfrageinstrumente“ oder „Nachfragepolitik“) haben zwar einerseits effektiv den Ausbau von EE ermöglicht, sowie positive Effekte auf Innovation und Kosten von EE hervorgerufen. Jedoch führten die Nachfrageinstrumente für EE anderseits nicht nur zu hohen Kosten, sondern verringerten auch die technologische Vielfalt. Alternative Technologien, die bei Einführung der Nachfrageinstrumente nicht kostengünstig waren, konnten sich nicht im Markt etablieren. Somit resultierten die Nachfrageinstrumente oft in einen „Lock-in“ der kurzfristig kostengünstigsten Technologie. Zusätzlich zu diesen beiden Effekten fordert der rasante Ausbau von stark schwankender Windkraft und Photovoltaik, welcher durch die Nachfrageinstrumente endstanden ist, Stromqualität und Netzstabilität heraus. Neben Netzausbau und Nachfragesteuerung, können insbesondere stationäre Elektrizitätsspeicher (SES) mit Ihrer Fähigkeit Stromproduktion und –nachfrage zeitlich zu entkoppeln, den weiteren Ausbau von EE ermöglichen. Tatsächlich wurden in den letzten Monaten Fördermaßnahmen speziell für SES in verschiedenen Ländern implementiert. Diese Dissertation zielt darauf ab das Verständnis zu verbessern, in welcher Weise der Gesetzgeber den Ausbau von SES fördern kann. Im Einzelnen wird untersucht wie die negativen Konsequenzen, die bei Nachfrageinstrumenten für EE beobachtet werden konnten (hohe Kosten und reduzierte technologische Vielfalt), im Fall von SES verringert werden können. Im Zuge dessen spielt eine Eigenschaft von SES eine besondere Rolle: Im Gegensatz zu den meisten EE, sind SES sogenannte „Multi-Purpose Technologien“ (MPT) da sie auf sehr verschiedene Weise und für viele verschiedene Anwender ökonomischen Wert erzeugen können und daher eine Vielzahl von unterschiedlichen Anwendungen haben. Obwohl diese Eigenschaft dem Gesetzgeber zusätzliche Freiheitsgrade in der Ausgestaltung der Fördermaßnahmen bietet, wurden deren praktische und theoretische Implikationen bisher nicht wissenschaftlich untersucht. Aus diesem Grund untersucht die vorliegende Dissertation die folgende Forschungsfrage: Wie kann der Gesetzgeber den Ausbau von Multi-Purpose Technologien fördern ohne die technologische Vielfalt zu reduzieren und gleichzeitig die Kosten dieser Nachfragepolitik begrenzen? Um diese Forschungsfrage zu eruieren, baut die vorliegende Dissertation auf Erkenntnissen der Ökonomie und Innovationswissenschaften auf und setzt techno-ökonomische Modellierung von Energiespeichern sowie ökonometrische Analysen von Patentdaten ein. Insgesamt werden hierzu vier verschiedene wissenschaftliche Artikel präsentiert von denen jeweils zwei die Kosten der Nachfragepolitik und zwei den Zusammenhang zwischen Nachfragepolitik und technologischer v Vielfalt adressieren. Dabei untersucht der erste Artikel die Kosten von SES in verschiedenen Anwendungen. Ein wichtiges Ergebnis ist, dass die SES Kosten – und damit auch indirekt die Kosten diese Technologien zu unterstützen – einerseits noch sehr hoch sind, sich aber andererseits sehr stark über verschiedene Anwendungen unterscheiden. Aufbauend auf diesen Ergebnissen, fügt der zweite Artikel den Kosten von SES eine Analyse über den ökomischen Wert der Anwendungen hinzu um Implikationen von für eine kostengünstige Nachfrageförderung von SES abzuleiten. Im Gegensatz zu den ersten beiden Artikeln, fokussiert der dritte auf den Zusammenhang zwischen Nachfragepolitik und technologischer Vielfalt. Basierend auf einer Analyse der Verbreitung von technischen Wissen zwischen verschiedenen Technologien, identifiziert dieser ein hohes Risiko eines Lock-ins, falls die Nachfrageförderung nur eine Technologie erreichen würde. Auf Grundlage dieses Ergebnisses untersucht der vierte Artikel seinerseits den Wettbewerb zwischen SES Technologien in verschiedenen Anwendungen um Ideen für eine Nachfrageförderung zu entwickeln, die das Risiko eines Lock-ins minimieren. Verschiedene Implikationen für den Gesetzgeber lassen sich aus diesen Ergebnissen ableiten. Die Kosten der Nachfragepolitik können im Fall von Multi-Purpose Technologien reduziert werden, wenn der Ausbau von Technologien sequentiell – basierend auf der Profitabilität der Technologien – in einzelnen Anwendungen unterstützt wird. Das Risiko eines verfrühten Lock-ins in eine einzelne Technologie kann dadurch reduziert werden, dass entweder Anwendungen unterstützt werden, die einen hohen Wettbewerb zwischen Technologien aufweisen, oder indem die Spezifität der Förderung im Hinblick auf Technologien oder Anwendungen angepasst wird. Außerdem kann eine Förderung von Forschungs- und Demonstrationsprojekten, die tendenziell spezialisiertes Wissen in Kernbereichen von Technologien generieren, die Entwicklung von einzelnen Technologien beschleunigen. Auf der anderen Seite würde eine Förderung von diversifiziertem Wissen in Randbereichen von Technologien den Wissensaustausch zwischen Technologien verstärken und dadurch das Lock-in Risiko reduzieren. Insgesamt bietet diese Dissertation verschiedene Beiträge zu der bestehenden Literatur. Theoretische Beiträge resultierten aus der Definition und Diskussion von Multi-Purpose Technologien sowie aus der Einführung der Anwendungsperspektive in die Lock-in Literatur. Ein weiterer theoretischer Beitrag liegt in der – nach Einschätzung des Autors – ersten Studie zu den Einflussfaktoren von Wissenstransfers innerhalb und zwischen verschiedenen Technologien. Diese Studie kann nicht nur bestehende Widersprüche in der Literatur zur Diffusion von technischem Wissen auflösen, sondern verbindet auch zwei bisher getrennte Literaturströme. Methodische Beiträge können in einem Ansatz den Wert von SES in verschiedenen Anwendungen zu schätzen, einem Indikator, der das Lock-in Risiko durch Nachfrageförderung beschreibt, und dem Operationalisieren der Zentralität von Wissen durch die Produktarchitektur gefunden werden. Schließlich könnten verschiedene empirische vi Ergebnisse dieser Dissertation, insbesondere in Bezug auf Wirtschaftlichkeit und Anwendungen von SES, von großem Wert für Entscheidungsträgern in Politik und Wirtschaft sein. vii viii Table of contents Acknowledgements i Abstract ii Zusammenfassung iv Table of contents viii 1.

Introduction In recent years, many governments around the world have introduced deployment policies to foster the diffusion of renewable energy technologies (RETs) (IPCC, 2007; IEA, 2011a; REN21, 2012). These policies have effectively increased the diffusion of these technologies (primarily wind and solar PV) and facilitated technological learning and innovation, resulting in strong performance improvements and cost reductions (IRENA, 2012a). However, these deployment policies have also led to considerable negative consequences. First, they have resulted in high economic costs (del Río González and Gual, 2007; Frondel et al., 2010) and, second, they have partially endangered technological diversity by locking out technological options that were not commercially competitive at the time of policy introduction (e.g., thin film solar photovoltaic) (Hoppmann et al., 2013). 1 Above all, the massive diffusion of renewable energy technologies induced by these policies has challenged power security and quality due to the non- deterministic and intermittent characteristic of most of these technologies (Georgilakis, 2008; IEA, 2011a, 2011b). Stationary electricity storage (SES), with its ability to decouple energy generation and consumption over time, is one of the most promising technical options to address intermittency resulting from high shares of RETs (Culver and Miller, 2010; IRENA, 2012b). Since extensions of transmission and distribution grids typically face high public opposition and the realizable potential of demand-side management is constrained (Hollinger et al., 2013), policy makers have started to introduce deployment support schemes for SES as well (Borden and Schill, 2013). The present dissertation aims to improve the understanding of how policy makers can support the diffusion of and innovation in SES technologies. Based on the experience with support policies for RETs and grounded in the literature on technical change and innovation, it employs techno-economic simulations, along with a regression analysis of patent data, to investigate innovation and market dynamics of specific SES technologies. From these analyses, recommendations are derived on how the deployment of SES can be supported at minimal economic costs while reducing the risk of a premature technological lock-in. 2 1 Adapted from the general definition of diversity (“pursuit of an evenly balanced reliance on a variety of mutually disparate options” (Stirling, 2010, p. 1622)), technological diversity is understood in this dissertation from a market perspective as a state of a techno-economic system in which several technologies with comparable service characteristics co-exist under market conditions and compete against each other. Moreover, technological diversity is a continuum rather than a binary indicator (van den Bergh, 2008). 2 In contrast to technological diversity, a “lock-in” into a technology can be defined as a persistent state of a techno-economic system in which this technology has a dominant position in the market while alternative technical options have only a small possibility of increasing their adoption rate without exogenous shocks (Unruh, 2000; Vergne and Durand, 2010; van der Vooren et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). A lock-in results from path-dependent processes that reinforce the leading position of the locked-in technology on both technology supply (learning-by-doing, economies of scope and scale, standardization) 2 The remainder of this introduction briefly describes the development of deployment policies and the diffusion of RETs (section 1.1), before shifting focus to stationary electricity storage as an enabling technology for energy systems with high shares of renewable energy technologies (section 1.2). This introduction ends with a presentation of the overall research question of this dissertation (section 1.3). 1.1 Deployment policies for renewable energy technologies in response to climate change On one hand, the provision of energy to their citizens is one of the most important challenges for modern societies. Energy lies at the core of basic human needs; it is required, for instance, for heating, cooking, light and mobility, and thus is arguably one of the pivotal factors in human development (Fouquet, 2008). Driven by both strong growth in the global population and by increasing living standards across countries, the worldwide demand for energy has risen sharply in the last decades. Total primary energy consumption increased exponentially between 1980 and 2010, with an average annual growth rate of 2% (U.S. Energy Information Agency, 2013), and most forecasts expect a continued rise in worldwide energy demand in the years to come (IEA, 2013). On the other hand, the current reliance on fossil-based energy is one of the primary factors behind increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, which are described as the main driver behind recent climate change by an overwhelming majority of climate researchers (Anderegg et al., 2010). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states clearly that the observed warming of the climate system is unequivocal and “unprecedented over decades to millennia,” continuing that, “the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased” (IPCC, 2013, p. 4). The combustion of fossil fuels accounts for 57% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, while the power sector was the largest contributor from a sector perspective (IPCC, 2007). In order to respond to the rising energy demand worldwide while simultaneously mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, many governments around the world have introduced deployment policies for clean energy technologies (REN21, 2012). These clean energy technologies aim to provide energy from renewable and low-emission sources, as well as to increase the overall energy efficiency of an economy, and thereby strive to meet energy demand while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A large share of the deployment policies for clean energy technologies are targeted at renewable energy technologies (RETs) such as solar power, wind power, and biomass. Since 2005, the number of countries that have implemented support schemes for RETs has more than doubled, reaching 109 countries in 2012 (REN21, 2012). and market demand sides (decreasing uncertainty, learning-by-using, network externalities, economies of scale in consumption) (Katz and Shapiro, 1985; Arthur, 1989; Sandén and Azar, 2005; van den Bergh, 2008). 3 These deployment policies for RETs have effectively increased the share of renewable power generation: renewable energy sources now account for more than 20% of global electricity production (REN21, 2012). 3 In some regions, RETs constitute the vast majority of new power capacity additions. For instance, renewables represented 71% of total capacity additions in the European Union, pushing the share of renewable power generating capacity in this area to more than 31% in 2011 (REN21, 2012). The capacity additions of RETs have increased massively in other areas as well, including China and the United States. However, the strong increase in energy produced by RETs also led to negative consequences. The next section derives the role of stationary electricity storage (SES) as a promising response option to cope with the challenges induced by RETs. 1.2 Stationary electricity storage as enabling technology for a renewable energy systems Although the diffusion of RETs is typically acknowledged as beneficial from a climate change perspective, it also bears potential challenges. The rising share of RETs in total power generation stems mostly from wind and solar power, which accounted for about 40% and 30% of worldwide renewable power capacity additions in 2011 respectively (REN21, 2012). However, the rate of power production of these technologies fluctuates constantly in response to meteorological conditions, creating a challenge in terms of power stability and security, since power supply and demand must be continuously balanced in modern energy systems (IRENA, 2012b). In fact, the intermittent and non- deterministic character of most RET generation capacity is often perceived as one of the major bottlenecks for a transition towards a more sustainable energy system (Kohler et al., 2010; IEA, 2011b; Krajačić et al., 2011a). Among the technical levers to cope with the challenges induced by intermittent RETs, stationary electricity storage is a highly promising option. Because alternative technical options face strong public opposition or have a limited technical potential (in particular extensions of the transmission and distribution grid, as well as demand-side management) (The Economist, 2012; Hollinger et al., 2013), the attention of practitioners and policy makers has been shifting towards SES. The ability of SES to decouple energy supply and demand over time enables this technology to balance the fluctuations of intermittent RETs. Especially for energy systems with high shares of intermittent RETs, SES is widely seen as a key component, and even prerequisite, to ensure power stability and quality (IEA, 2014). Although today the demand of SES is limited in most countries, with the exception of islands grids and countries strongly exposed to intermittent RETs production (e.g., Denmark), the systemic need for 3 This comprises roughly 15% hydro and 5.0% non-hydro (e.g., solar, wind, biomass) (REN21, 2012). 4 a strong deployment of SES is expected to appear in the near future (IRENA, 2012b; VDE, 2012; Hollinger et al., 2013). Although the primary rationale behind the deployment of SES stems from its ability to integrate intermittent RETs, SES can create value in the energy system through multiple mechanisms. Specifically, SES can create economic value by exploiting price differentials, by increasing the utilization of existing assets (e.g., T&D transmission lines), by improving power quality, and by guaranteeing a stable power supply (EPRI, 2010). Moreover, SES can be employed by multiple stakeholders and at different grid levels across the energy value chain, ranging from generation, transmission and distribution to retail and consumption. This characteristic of SES - to have different sources of value creation across different stakeholders - makes it an interesting technology from a theoretical perspective (i.e., a multi-purpose technology, cf. section 2.2) and offers policy makers additional degrees of freedoms in the handling of this technology. Several distinct SES technologies exist that can serve the multiple SES applications in the energy system, ranging from “high-energy” technologies (e.g., pumped hydro, compressed air energy storage, and hydrogen storage), to “high-power” technologies (e.g., supercapacitors, flywheels and superconducting magnetic energy storage) (Neupert et al., 2009; Manz and Keller, 2011). Between high-energy and high-power technologies, electrochemical batteries are seen as “bridging technologies,” capable of serving energy, power and hybrid SES applications. Due to this flexibility in serving multiple applications, their modular and scalable character, the relevance for adjacent sectors (e.g., mobile applications and transport) and the high level of attention that currently rests upon these technologies, the present dissertation focuses on stationary batteries (Borden and Schill, 2013). In particular, four specific electrochemical batteries (lithium-ion, lead-acid, sodium-sulfur and vanadium- redox-flow) are in the focus of most analyses, since these technologies are commonly perceived as options with a high potential for grid-scale SES (Proser, 2011; Sauer et al., 2011). 1.3 Research question – Implementing deployment support for stationary electricity storage Despite the apparent systemic need for SES technologies in the future, the large-scale deployment of SES is limited within most energy systems. Due to capacity constraints in mature technologies (i.e., pumped hydro) and high investment costs as well uncertainty in the performance and lifetime of emerging technologies such as stationary batteries, profitable business opportunities for private investors in SES are scarce (EPRI, 2010; VDE, 2012). In this situation, policy makers may step in to incentivize the diffusion of SES, thereby aiming to foster innovation and technological learning and thus enabling the large-scale deployment of SES (Wietschel et al., 2010; Krajačić et al., 2011b). 5 In fact, efforts by policy makers to foster the deployment of SES have emerged in several countries in recent years. Beyond the existing support schemes for research and development of SES technologies (Wietschel et al., 2010), several schemes have recently been implemented that explicitly support the deployment of various SES technologies. Prominent examples are various schemes in the United States (e.g., AB 2,514 in California or FERC Order 755), the support for distributed battery storage in Germany, as well as schemes targeted at grid-connected lithium-ion batteries in Japan (Borden and Schill, 2013; KfW, 2013; PV-Tech, 2014). In light of the systemic need for energy storage in the future and the recent policy efforts in this area, the question emerges as to how policy makers should support the deployment of SES. In order to state this question more precisely, this dissertation draws upon the experience gained with deployment support schemes for RETs and incorporates the multi-purpose character of SES. The experience with deployment policies for RETs has highlighted the potential downsides that they may entail. Notably, policy support schemes for technologies can result in high economic costs (Frondel et al., 2010; Hoppmann et al., 2014) or reduce technological diversity by locking in specific technologies (Unruh, 2000; Azar and Sandén, 2011). These theoretical arguments are confirmed by the experience of support schemes for RETs (del Río González and Gual, 2007; Hoppmann et al., 2013). Additionally, SES technologies can create value in a very different ways and for different stakeholders in the energy system, making them technologies that can serve multiple, distinct applications (i.e., a multi-purpose technology (MPT)). This multi-purpose character is highly relevant for policy makers since it adds an additional dimension to the question of how to support these kinds of technologies. Because multi- purpose technologies can serve different applications, policy makers have the option to choose which applications to support and where to create a market. While this additional dimension offers policy makers a new degree of freedom, the implications for the optimal design and implementation of support schemes for MPTs are unclear from both a practical and theoretical point of view. Consequently, the present dissertation strives to address this gap by investigating the following research question: How can policy makers support the deployment of multi -purpose technologies while limiting the costs of support policies and maintaining technological diversi ty? While this question addresses especially deployment support for technologies that have high number of distinct applications as, for instance, stationary electricity storage (cf. section 2.2), the perspective assumed in this dissertation is likely to be relevant for many technologies. Most technologies that have recently enjoyed policy support have more than one potential application (i.e., market) in the economy. For instance, the market for solar PV is typically differentiated between roof-top and open space installations. While the initial deployment support of solar PV in Germany was limited to roof-top installations, benefiting mostly crystalline silicon PV, the deployment support was extended to open 6 space installations in 2003 which resulted in deployment of both crystalline silicon and thin film PV (Hoppmann et al., 2013). Similarly, the sequential deployment support of wind onshore and wind offshore in the German feed-in tariff scheme supports the notion that also for wind power different applications are highly relevant for the design and implementation of deployment policies. Consequently, although the analyses presented in this dissertation address especially technologies that have a high number of distinct applications (i.e., multi-purpose technologies), the theoretical reasoning and the implications are likely to be applicable for a wide range of technologies. The remainder of this dissertation is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the theoretical background, deriving and discussing the objectives of this dissertation. Subsequently, section 3 presents data and methods employed to investigate the research question, before section 4 describes the results of the individual papers. Building upon these outcomes, section 5 discusses the results deriving the main contributions and implications of this dissertation. 7 2. Theoretical Background and Objectives The overarching objective of this dissertation is to improve the understanding of what policy makers should consider when designing deployment support for technologies with multiple, distinct applications (i.e., multi-purpose technologies (MPTs)). To this end, the case of stationary electricity storage (SES) is employed since the question of deployment policies is highly relevant and particularly urgent for this technology. Moreover, SES is a prime example of a MPT due to its ability to generate value in different ways and for different customers. Specifically, this dissertation sheds light on how policy makers can make use of the multi-purpose character of a technology in order to i) limit the costs of deployment policies and ii) maintain technological diversity. 4 Figure 1 depicts the research framework graphically. FIGURE 1: RESEARCH FRAMEWORK Four theoretical concepts are the “building blocks” of the subsequent analyses: The rationale for deployment policies, multi-purpose technologies, innovation and technological learning, and knowledge diffusion. The remainder of this section lays out these theoretical concepts as well as describes in detail the objectives of this dissertation. 4 Both objectives are described in section 2.5. Policy Deployment Multi-purpose character of a technology I. Limit costs of deployment support II. Maintain technological diversity Research question: How can policy makers support the deployment of multi-purpose technologies while limiting costs of support policies and maintaining technological diversity? 8 2.1 The rationale for deployment policies for clean energy technologies This section describes the rationale for deployment policies targeted at clean energy technologies before addressing the theoretical background, implementation and current status of such polices. The rationale for any policy intervention that supports the deployment of technologies is that some kind of market failure impedes markets from sufficiently incentivizing the deployment of the respective technology. In the case of clean energy technologies such as SES, practitioners and academics widely agree that the existence of market failures justifies policy intervention (Sagar and van der Zwaan, 2006; Krajačić et al., 2011b; Gross et al., 2012; IRENA, 2012b). 5 Two main arguments are at the core of this reasoning: First, conventional energy technologies, which are the alternative to clean energy technologies, exhibit negative externalities in the form of environmental pollution and human health hazards (Unruh, 2000).6 Without any policy intervention which make firms accountable for the negative externalities produced when employing these conventional energy technologies, the deployment of these technologies would be above the socially optimal level. Second, the value of knowledge produced in the context of the deployment of clean energy technologies is difficult for firms to appropriate completely (van Benthem et al., 2007; Gillingham and Sweeney, 2010). Since clean energy technologies exhibit a high degree of learning-by-doing and learning-by- using (Sagar and van der Zwaan, 2006; Gross et al., 2012), a substantial amount of knowledge is created through the deployment of these technologies. However, due to the public good character of knowledge in general, and the high share of tacit knowledge learning-by-doing and –by-using specifically, the created knowledge is difficult to protect (Gillingham and Sweeney, 2010). Without comprehensive legal protection of this knowledge, the actors involved in creating the knowledge cannot appropriate the value of the knowledge completely and thus have a reduced incentive to invest in the deployment of clean energy technologies (van Benthem et al., 2007). In summary, due to the negative externalities of conventional energy technologies and positive externalities of the knowledge created through the deployment of clean energy technologies, in the absence of policy intervention, “firms pollute too much and innovate too little compared with the social optimum” (Johnstone and Haščič, 2010, p. 3). It is important to note that the focus of the present research is not the question of desirability of policy intervention in the case of electricity storage technologies. Rather, this explained rationale should be understood as the starting assumption upon which the subsequent analysis is based. In general, deployment policies belong to the family of so-called “demand-pull” policies. In contrast to “technology-push” policies, which focus on the technology supply, the demand-pull concept 5 SES can be regarded as a clean energy technology since most SES applications in the power systems directly or indirectly enable the integration of RETs. 6 An externality can be defined as “an economically significant effect of an activity, the consequences of which are borne (at least in part) by a party or parties other than the party that controls the externality” (Jaffe et al., 2005, p. 165). 9 emphasizes the role of market demand in advancing technological development.7 At the core of the demand-pull argument is that firms react to new market demand by increasing both the development and deployment of specific technologies, thereby driving technological change and innovation (Schmookler, 1966; Dosi, 1982). “Technological knowledge grows primarily in directions determined by man's wants” (Schmookler, 1966, p. 82). This relationship between market demand and firms’ innovative activities can be exploited by policy makers. By stimulating market demand through deployment policies for specific technologies, policy can direct and accelerate technological change and innovation. Typical ways to implement deployment policies are through fiscal incentives, public finance and regulation (IRENA, 2013a). While, for instance, so-called command and control policies impose mandatory deployment of a given technology, prominent alternatives are tax incentives or grants, as well as remuneration guarantees (e.g., feed-in tariffs), that directly or indirectly support investment by private actors. Today, deployment policies are widely used by policy makers to promote clean energy technologies. At the beginning of 2012, 109 countries had implemented some kind of deployment policy for RETs (REN21, 2012). Feed-in tariffs are especially commonly used by governments (feed-in tariffs for RETs existed in 65 countries in 2012 (REN21, 2012)). Also, deployment policies targeting SES are beginning to be introduced in several countries. Prominent examples are the various schemes in the United States (e.g., AB 2,514 in California or FERC Order 755), the support for distributed battery storage in Germany, as well as the schemes targeted at grid-connected lithium-ion batteries in Japan (Borden and Schill, 2013; KfW, 2013; PV-Tech, 2014). 2.2 Multi-purpose technologies The present dissertation focuses on deployment policies for a specific kind of technology: Technologies that have multiple distinct, economically relevant applications. This dissertation defines such technologies as “multi-purpose technologies” (MPT) and derives implications for policy makers that stem from this multi-purpose character. This section introduces the concept of multi-purpose technologies (2.2.1) and exemplifies why stationary electricity storage (SES) is a prominent example of a MPT (2.2.2). 7 Derived from the observation that U.S. administration successfully supported basic research during World War II, the technology-push notion found early empirical support in the correlation between industry R&D and productivity (Bush, 1952; Mansfield, 1968). Assuming a quasi-linear innovation process from research to development towards deployment of a technology, this concept regards policy support in the R&D phases as key to fostering innovation. However, the pure focus on the supply side of a technology, neglecting any market forces, as well as the assumption of a linear innovation process, without iterations or feedback loops, spurred ample criticisms leading the development of the demand-pull concept (Mowery and Rosenberg, 1979). Although a consensus emerged among scholars that both concepts complement each other, the optimal balance between push and pull policies remains unclear (Sagar and van der Zwaan, 2006). 10 2.2.1 The concept of multi-purpose technologies (MPTs) Technologies are a pivotal aspect of modern economies. An important aspect to differentiate technologies is the number of use cases in an economy. Some technologies are typically employed for one single purpose (e.g., charging adapter, coffee machine) by mainly one user group, while so-called “general-purpose technologies” (e.g., the microprocessor) exhibit an almost indefinite number of use cases across the economy (Lipsey et al., 1998). Placed between single- and general-purpose, a multi- purpose technology (MPT) can be defined as follows (Paper 2): A multi-purpose technology (MPT) is a technology that has several distinct, economically relevant applications primarily focused on one or a few sectors, yet lacks the technological complementarities of general -purpose technologies. In contrast to general-purpose technologies (GPTs), MPTs lack the potential for pervasive use across a virtually unlimited number of applications and do not have the technological complementarities of GPTs which create economy–wide spillovers (cf. Breshnahan and Trajtenberg (1995), Lipsey et al. (1998)). The key characteristic of a MPT is the existence of multiple, distinct, economically relevant applications – where an application can be defined as a specific source of value creation for a specific customer / user group. Thus, a MPT can be understood as a technology that has the potential to create economic value in different ways and for different users or customers. Typical examples of MPTs are an X-ray, laser, or stationary electricity storage (Lipsey et al., 1998; Holm-Nielsen et al., 2009). For instance, the X-ray technology can create value by retrieving information (e.g., scanning) and by treating patients (e.g., cancer treatment). Moreover, X-rays are employed by diverse user groups, e.g., they are used in the health sector, security sector and by archeologists. Several important aspects should be highlighted with regard to the concept of MPTs. The applications of a MPT need to both be clearly differentiable (in terms of users/customer groups and value creation) and economically relevant. In other words, for policy makers to make use of the multi-purpose character of a technology, its applications need to be distinguishable and relevant from a market perspective. Since the applications of MPTs differ depending on customers, value drivers and competing technologies, each application can be conceptualized as a niche market in which a technology can develop (Nill and Kemp, 2009). Hence, given the multiple applications of MPT, policy makers can decide where to create a market by implementing application-based technology support policies. Moreover, the classification of technologies into single, multi- and general-purpose 11 technologies is continuous and depends on the level of abstraction (Lipsey et al., 1998). 8 Finally, a technology’s classification can change over time as technologies lose or gain (economically relevant) applications. 2.2.2 The multi-purpose character of stationary electricity storage The key characteristic of a multi-purpose technology (MPT) is the existence of multiple, distinct, economically relevant applications. This section describes the applications of stationary electricity storage (SES) that exemplify the MPT character. The fact that SES has multiple distinct applications in the energy system is well known by practitioners and academics working with this technology (IRENA, 2012b; IEA, 2014). 9 Typically, SES applications are differentiated from a technical point of view (i.e., they are classified by technical parameters such as required power capacity, required discharge duration, or cycle frequency). However, this technical perspective used to describe SES applications is not able to define SES applications. Consequently, publications in the literature on SES applications are highly inconsistent. The number of SES applications that are described by different publications range from 3 to 17 (Paper 2). To address this inconsistency, the technical mapping of SES applications was transformed in this dissertation into an economic mapping of SES applications along the dimensions that define MPT applications in general: source of value creation and customer / user group (Figure 2). Specifically, SES can create value by maintaining and improving power quality, ensuring an uninterrupted power supply, increasing the utilization of existing assets, and exploiting price differentials through arbitrage. Customers and users along the electricity supply chain (i.e., generation, transmission & distribution, end-consumer) can benefit from these sources of value creation. These two dimensions result in an economic framework with 14 distinct SES applications which are able to define applications instead of just depict them.10 Thus, by showing that SES can create economic value in different ways and across different customers groups, the economic framework underlines the multi-purpose character of SES. Policy makers can make use of the multi-purpose character of SES when implementing deployment policies. 8 Lipsey et al. (1998) point out that at a very low level of abstraction, any technology has a single use case (e.g., SES stores and releases electric energy). However, the classification of multi and general-purpose technologies depends on how many distinct uses cases a technology has in the economy. 9 In fact, the multiple applications of SES are widely seen as an important barrier to the diffusion of SES because the value that is created by this technology is spread across actors in the energy system, thus reducing the attractiveness for private investment in this technology (IEA, 2014). 10 A detailed description of the fourteen SES applications can be found in Paper 2. 12 FIGURE 2: OVERVIEW OF STATIONARY ELECTRICITY STORAGE (SES) APPLICATIONS 2.3 Fundamentals of innovation and technological learning A principle assumption on which most analyses of this dissertation are based is that deployment of a technology results in technological learning. Both the contributions with respect to objective I (limit of deployment support) and objective II (maintain technological diversity) leverage in some way this notion. Therefore, this section briefly presents the fundamental concepts of innovation and technological learning. Although innovation and technological learning has long been acknowledged as a key driver of economic progress, classical economics typically treated this aspect as exogenous, i.e., innovation was seen as “random phenomenon” similar to “manna from heaven” (Fagerberg, 2006). Schumpeter (1934) was one of the first that rejected this understanding, developing a multitude of concepts on innovation which are still highly relevant today. He described the innovative process as inherently uncertain, causing entrepreneurs (Schumpeter Mark I) and firms (Schumpeter Mark II) to take risks and move quickly. Novel solutions by entrepreneurs are impeded by “social inertia”, yet if they prevail, they Source of economic value Arbitrage Location in the electricity supply chain Generation Transmission & Distribution End-consumer Increased Utilization of Existing Assets Power Quality Power Reliability PrivateIndustrialFossil Frequency Voltage Not relatedDirectly Indirectly Relationship to the integration of RETs: End-consumer Arbitrage End- consumer Power Quality End-consumer Power Reliability Black Start Reserve Capacity Support of Voltage Regulation Area & Frequency Regulation T&D Investment Deferral Load Following RET Firming Increase of Self- consumption RET Smoothing Wholesale Arbitrage RET Arbitrage RETsa a RETs refers primarily to intermittent, non-deterministic renewable energy technologies 13 have the tendency to push the economic system out of the “stationary” equilibrium resulting in progress and growth (Hall and Rosenberg, 2010). 11 Based upon the concepts advanced by Schumpeter, the so-called evolutionary perspective on innovation gained importance. “The nature of invention ... is an evolution, rather than a series of creations, and much resembles a biologic process” (Gilfillan, 1935, p. 275), as searching actors “mutate” existing technological options, thereby increasing the technological variety, before a selection mechanism (e.g., the market) centers on one or a few options.12 Several scholars described innovation as a dynamic and continuous process characterized by non-linearity, complexity and uncertainty (Kline and Rosenberg, 1986; Metcalfe, 1994; Fagerberg, 2006). This perspective explicitly deviates from the key assumptions in classical economics which revolve around the rational choice of actors in a situation of complete information (Hall and Rosenberg, 2010). An important aspect of most innovations is that they leverage the cumulative character of knowledge by recombining existing knowledge – potentially from a set of distinct technologies – into new artifacts (i.e., “cumulative synthesis”) (Usher, 1954; Nelson and Winter, 1982). Thus, the interaction of firms and the existence of networks, which enable knowledge sharing and spillovers, are further relevant characteristics of the innovation process. A main driver of the innovation process is technological learning by firms (Malerba, 1992). Three distinct learning mechanisms are typically distinguished in literature.13 Nelson and Winter (1982), as well as Dosi (1988), conceptualized research and development efforts by firm as a search process leading to the notion of learning-by-searching. Moreover, learning can occur as a side-product of the production process (learning-by-doing) as firms continuously strive to increase their efficiency, leading to incremental innovation in both the production process and the product itself (David, 1975). Finally, learning can result from interaction with and feedback from users during the use-phase of a technology (i.e., learning-by-using) (Rosenberg, 1982). Deployment policies target all three learning mechanisms. The market signals induced by deployment policies affect firms’ allocation of research and development capacities (i.e., learning-by-searching). The diffusion of the technology enabled by deployment policies results in both learning-by-doing and learning-by-using and thus has the potential to induce innovation within this technology. 11 Schumpeter also introduced the distinction between an invention, the emergence of a new idea, and an innovation, the commercialization in the market of this idea. 12 A technology can be understood both from a process-perspective (e.g., a set of recipes or routines that lead to a given output) or from an artifact-perspective (e.g., the specific physical item). This dissertation assumes the latter perspective. 13 Additionally, to the three “internal” learning mechanisms of firms that are presented in this section, Malerba (1992) differentiates three “external” learning mechanism (learning from advances in science and technology, learning by interaction, learning from inter-industry spillovers). 14 However, besides the question how technological knowledge is created through deployment policies, the degree it diffuses within and across technologies is highly relevant for the effectiveness of deployment policies. Thus, the next section addresses the characteristics of technological knowledge and the determinants of diffusion of knowledge. 2.4 Diffusion of technological knowledge The diffusion of technological knowledge is a key factor for innovation and technological change in general (as new inventions are typically based upon existing knowledge), and for technological diversity in particular (as the degree to which knowledge is transferred across technologies is a decisive factor for technological diversity). Consequently, this section briefly describes the concept of technological knowledge as well as the diffusion of knowledge across technologies. One way to describe knowledge in general is to highlight its characteristics. Knowledge is non-rival in use (i.e., the use of knowledge by one actor does not limit its use by other actors), intrinsically indivisible (i.e., half of an idea is not worth half of the value of the full idea), and exhibits high upfront costs in its generation, compared to low costs during utilization (Dosi and Nelson, 2010). Especially the latter feature leads to strongly increasing returns for any economic activity which depend to a high degree on knowledge (Arrow, 1996). Technological knowledge, in contrast, exhibits two characteristics which distinguish it from knowledge in general. First, although it is also non-rival in use, the replication of technological knowledge is often associated with high costs and efforts. As technological knowledge is typically embodied in production processes or artifacts, “the actual process of reproduction involves significant efforts, costs, and degrees of uncertainty about the ultimate success” (Dosi and Nelson, 2010, p. 58). Second, technological knowledge typically exhibits tacit elements (Nelson and Winter, 1982). In contrast to codified knowledge, tacit knowledge is difficult to transfer across actors and thus limits the replication of technological knowledge. Nevertheless, technological knowledge is seen as one of the key drivers of economic growth in modern societies (Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 2002). Studies on the degree and determinants diffusion of knowledge investigate how knowledge is transferred across actors in multiple dimensions. Geographic knowledge spillovers within and across countries have been analyzed, among others, by Jaffe (1993), Jaffe and Trajtenberg (1996), and Branstetter (2001) while, for instance, Jaffe (1986) as well as Verspagen and de Loo (1999) focused on knowledge spillovers across firms and sectors respectively. Recently, knowledge diffusion across technologies has enjoyed a rising level of attention predominantly driven by scholars investigating the dynamics of technological change and innovation. Multiple scientific studies found evidence that the amount of knowledge that flows across technologies depends strongly on the technology in focus: Different dynamics of knowledge flows have been found across all major technological fields (Nemet, 15 2012; Nemet and Johnson, 2012), across different technological groups (Dechezleprêtre et al., 2013), and across different sectors (Verspagen, 1997). The literature that investigates the question which kind of technological knowledge is likely to result in a high number of knowledge flows can broadly be divided in two streams. On the one side are scholars who refer to the “cumulative character” of knowledge creation, i.e. who emphasize that combining prior knowledge from different technological domains has a positive impact on the importance of newly created knowledge resulting in a high propensity to generate subsequent knowledge flows (Usher, 1954; Arthur, 2009). On the other side, there are scholars who argue that creating highly specialized knowledge will result in a high number of knowledge flows from the newly created knowledge (Dosi, 1982, 1997; Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). 14 Empirical studies on this question show contradictory results reflecting the ambivalence of the two lines of argumentation (Schoenmakers and Duysters, 2010, Nemet and Johnson, 2012; Nemet, 2012). However, these previous studies on knowledge flows did not differentiate the knowledge flows by the recipient technologies. Thus, an understanding of what factors determine whether knowledge is typically transferred within the same technology, or whether knowledge spills over across technologies, is missing in literature, although this aspect is highly relevant for technological diversity. Knowledge flows within the same technology have the tendency to reinforce established technological trajectories, while knowledge spillovers across technologies have the potential to maintain or even to increase technological diversity. 15 Therefore, Paper 3 strives to address this gap by investigating the determinants of knowledge diffusion within and across technologies (cf. section 2.5.3). 14 Specialized knowledge typically integrates mainly prior knowledge from the same technological domain. 15 Technologies typically evolve along technological trajectories which summarize the incremental development of the technology responding to innovative opportunities once a broad technological paradigm as the development path has been established (Dosi, 1982; Cimoli and Dosi, 1995). In other words, a technological trajectory can be defined as the “pattern of 'normal’ problem solving activity (i.e., of ’progress’) on the ground of a technological paradigm” (Dosi, 1982, p. 152). 16 2.5 Objectives of this dissertation This section describes the two overarching objectives of this dissertation, before it presents briefly the specific objectives of the individual papers. 2.5.1 Objective I: Limit cost of deployment policies The first specific objective of this dissertation is to contribute to the understanding of how policy makers can implement deployment policies for multi-purpose technologies while limiting the cost of these policies. After a short perspective on the efficiency of policies, this section describes the motivations of this first objective. While policy makers need to consider many objectives when designing deployment policies (e.g., creating local employment, fostering innovation, reducing environmental pollution), efficiency with respect to costs is arguably one of the most important (IRENA, 2013b). Mitchell et al. (2011) defined efficiency in the context of renewable energy policies as “the ratio of outcomes to inputs, for example, renewable energy targets realized for economic resources spent”. Fundamentally, and similar to any resource allocation optimization, policy makers should try to allocate financial resources depending on the marginal increase in economic welfare. With respect to deployment policies, this notion implies that the cost of these policies needs to be related to the enabled incremental diffusion of the technology. The cost of deployment policies depends on the targeted diffusion of the technology (e.g., installed capacity of SES) and on the gap-to-profitability level that needs to be covered by the policy. In order for a technology to diffuse, profitable business opportunities need to exist, which in turn enable private investment in this technology. Thus, the cost of a deployment policy depends on the size of the incentive that needs to be offered to private investors and, therefore, on the gap-to-profitability level that the technology exhibits without any policy support. 16 In cases where a technology is almost competitive, the incentive needed to enable diffusion is rather small, while a substantial incentive is needed in the case of an immature technology with considerably higher costs than alternative options. Moreover, the incentive needed might change over time. With the diffusion of technology, learning and innovation can reduce its costs, improving the competitiveness of this technology and thus lowering the incentive needed for further deployment. For instance, the feed-in tariff in Germany for small roof-mounted solar power decreased from 57.4 EUR cents / kWh in 2003 to below 14 EUR cents / kWh in 2013 (Bundesnetzagentur, 2014; Hoppmann et al., 2014). 16 In cases where deployment policies are implemented through mandatory quotas (e.g., a specific percentage of solar power generation capacity), the total cost of the policy depends on the gap-to-profitability of the respective technology as well. The difference between this approach and financial incentives for the deployment of a technology is that a different actor has to bear the costs. 17 However, the costs that result from deployment policies can still be substantial (del Río González, 2012). Worldwide subsidies for RETs amounted to 101 billion USD in 2012 (IEA, 2013), but tax payers in some countries are more affected than in others. Taking Germany as an example, Frondel et al. (2010) approximated that the cumulative costs of direct and indirect subsidies for solar power was up to 65.5 billion EUR by 2010, while the annual value of the redistribution mechanism to finance German RETs subsidies (EEG apportionment) was estimated to have reached 14.1 billion EUR in 2012 (BMU, 2012). As a consequence of these high costs, opposition to support schemes for RETs is emerging in Germany. Hence, with respect to the optimal allocation of financial resources in general, and to high costs that resulted from existing support schemes for clean energy technologies specifically, policy makers have an incentive to limit costs for additional deployment policies. This dissertation strives to offer advice to policy makers on how the costs for deployment policies can be limited in the case of multi-purpose technologies. 2.5.2 Objective II: Maintain technological diversity The second specific objective of this dissertation is to improve the understanding of how policy makers can implement deployment policies for multi-purpose technologies while maintaining technological diversity. The present section develops this objective in two steps. First, the value of technological diversity is described, afterwards the link between deployment policies and technological diversity is derived. The high value of technological diversity is widely accepted by practitioners and academics (van den Bergh, 2008; Azar and Sandén, 2011; Gross et al., 2012; Kalkuhl et al., 2012). Although in the short- run, a lock-in of one technology can yield cost savings due to standardization, learning-by-using and learning-by–doing, and economies of scale, maintaining technological diversity can be seen as beneficial for several reasons. In a technologically diverse economic system, “superior” technologies that might have a high learning potential, yet are initially less mature compared with established alternatives, have the chance to develop in the market (van der Zwaan et al., 2002; Sandén and Azar, 2005; del Río González, 2008; Kalkuhl et al., 2012). Moreover, technological diversity is likely to accelerate innovation in general due to inter-technology learning spillovers and positive effects from competition among firms developing and producing different technologies (van den Bergh, 2008; van der Vooren et al., 2012). Finally, technological diversity improves the overall resilience of a techno- economic system due to the increased ability to adapt to unexpected shocks (Stirling, 2007, 2010). The link between deployment policies and technological diversity depends on the number and specificity/neutrality of the deployment policies as well as on the degree of competition among technologies (Arthur, 1989; Azar and Sandén, 2011; Winskel et al., 2013). Rather technology-neutral (or less technology-specific) deployment policies target all technologies that can be employed to 18 accomplish specific objectives (e.g., a carbon tax, renewable portfolio standards) (Jaffe et al., 2005), while highly technology-specific deployment policies are targeted at specific technologies (e.g., a feed-in tariff for offshore wind generation). On the one hand, by introducing highly technology- specific deployment policies, policy makers explicitly decide which technology shall benefit and thereby directly affect the technological diversity. Depending on the number of different highly technology-specific deployment policies, technological diversity can be increased or decreased. On the other hand, although technology-neutral deployment policies do not favor a specific technology explicitly, they can also entail a technological lock-in, which, in this case, is created through market selection mechanisms. As market participants effectively select the technology that is the most competitive at the point the policy is introduced, only one or a few technologies may benefit from the technology-neutral policies (Azar and Sandén, 2011). This selection mechanism may be reinforced through path-dependent processes on both the technology supply and market demand side, generating positive feedback loops and increasing the risk of a premature lock-in (Katz and Shapiro, 1985; Arthur, 1989; Sandén and Azar, 2005; van den Bergh, 2008). Whether market participants select one or several technologies depends on the degree of competition among technologies (i.e., the difference in techno-economic performance between technologies) (Arthur, 1989). While in case the degree of competition is high, several technologies are likely to benefit from deployment policies, in case of a low degree of competition one technology will benefit most resulting in a high lock-in risk. Finally, policy makers need to be aware that inter-technology knowledge spillovers can mitigate the risk of premature lock-in of one technology. In the case where a large amount of knowledge is transferred between technologies, a technology that is disadvantaged in a market can still benefit from the diffusion of the other technology. In summary, although the high value of technological diversity is widely accepted, the way in which policy makers can best ensure it is under debate (Azar and Sandén, 2011). Deployment policies can increase or decrease the technological diversity depending on the number and specificity of these policies as well as on the degree of competition among technologies. However, in the case of multi- purpose technologies, policy makers have an additional degree of freedom when implementing deployment policies due to the existence of several distinct applications. The present dissertation aims to contribute to the debate by analyzing the options that result from the multi-purpose character of technologies with respect to the link between deployment policies and technological diversity. 19 2.5.3 Specific objectives of individual papers Four individual papers contribute to the overall goal of this dissertation to inform policy makers regarding deployment policies for multi-purpose technologies. In particular, this dissertation aims to shed light on how policymakers can make use of the multi-purpose character of a technology in order to i) limit the costs of deployment policies and ii) maintain technological diversity. Each of these objectives is addressed by two papers in a two-step process: The first paper for each objective investigates the relevance of the objective focusing on the technology level, while the second paper builds upon the results from the first paper and expands the analysis to the market level in order to derive implications for deployment policies (Figure 3). FIGURE 3: OVERVIEW OF PAPERS With respect to the first objective (limit costs of deployment policies), Paper 1 investigates the life- cycle costs of several SES technologies across energy system applications, highlighting the high costs of SES technologies in general as well as the strong variation of these costs across applications. Paper 2 builds upon this finding on the technology level by incorporating the value of the applications served in the energy market. Based on the resulting profitability distributions and taking into account the Objectives Focus Deployment support policy for a multi-purpose technology a) Relevance of question b) Potential solutions Research question: How can policy makers support the deployment of multi-purpose technologies while limiting costs of support policies and maintaining technological diversity? # Paper I) Limit costs of deployment support 1 2 II) Maintain technological diversity 3 4 Theoretical concepts ▪ Multi-purpose technologies ▪ Multi-purpose technologies ▪ Technological learning ▪ Multi-purpose technologies ▪ Technological learning / Lock-in ▪ Knowledge diffusion ▪ Technological learning 20 multi-purpose character of SES, Paper 2 develops a strategy for policy makers to implement efficient deployment policies. With respect to the second objective (maintain technological diversity), Paper 3 analyzes the determinants of knowledge diffusion within and across SES technologies. A main result of Paper 3 is the limited amount of inter-technology spillovers in general, and specifically of specialized knowledge on core parts of a technology, underlying the risk of a lock-in through deployment policies. In response to this finding, Paper 4 investigates the degree of competition among SES technologies holistically in order to derive implications for a deployment policy for MPTs that minimizes the risk of a technological lock-in.

Methods and Data Table 2 gives an overview of the methods and data sources used in the four papers of this dissertation. Two distinct quantitative methodological approaches are employed across the four papers. First, at the core of Paper 1, 2 and 4 is a probabilistic techno-economic model of SES technologies that simulates costs and performance characteristics across different settings and applications. Paper 2 expands the techno-economic model with a market model to simulate the value and profitability of SES technologies. Paper 4 integrates the techno-economic model into an actor-based model to simulate investment decisions in SES technologies under uncertainty. Second, Paper 3 employs econometric regression techniques to analyze patent data on battery technologies with respect to the dynamics and determinants of knowledge diffusion across technologies. The remainder of this section describes the research method and data used in the four papers.

Specifically, it assesses the life-cycle costs of the four battery technologies: lithium-ion, lead-acid, sodium-sulfur, vanadium- redox-flows since these technologies are typically seen as promising options for grid-scale storage (Proser, 2011; Sauer et al., 2011). The six analyzed applications can be divided into four “high-energy” applications (Utility Energy Time-Shift, Energy Management, Transmission & Distribution (T&D) Investment Deferral, Increase of Self-Consumption) and two “high-power” applications (Area and Frequency Regulation and Support of Voltage Regulation) (Manz and Keller, 2011). 17 A probabilistic techno-economic model is used to calculate the life-cycle costs of SES technologies across these applications. The life-cycle costs are assessed using the Levelized Costs of Electricity (LCOE) concept, which sets the costs occurring during the lifetime of a technology in relation to the total energy production (i.e., energy throughput in case of storage technologies). This concept is widely used in literature since it allows for the comparison of the costs of energy technologies with different lifetime and performance characteristics (Branker et al., 2011; Schmidt et al., 2012a). ∑ ∑ (1) Both technical and application input parameters are retrieved from a literature review and are validated through expert interviews. 18 Additionally, a data set of grid frequency data for the Swiss electricity network is analyzed in order to derive and validate application parameters of Area & Frequency Regulation. Due to the low maturity of stationary battery technologies, the literature review revealed strongly diverging input values even for the main technical parameters. To account for this uncertainty, the main technical input parameters are employed as stochastic variables in the model (i.e., using random distributions instead of single input values). 19 17 Since Paper 1 was published before the economic framework of SES applications (cf., Figure 2) was finalized, the names of the application differ slightly in both publications. 18 In total, ten research and industry experts (from universities, independent research institutions, battery manufacturer, battery project developer, system integrator and energy utility) were interviewed. 19 The technical input parameters comprise four stochastic parameters (energy capacity costs, round-trip efficiency, calendrical life, cycle life) and three deterministic parameters (power conversion system costs, balance-of-plant costs, CAPEX: Investment costs [EUR] i: Discount rate [%] OPEX: Operation & maintenance costs [EUR] N: Plant lifetime [years] kWhinitial,net: Initial net electricity production [kWh] 23 The model calculates the life-cycle costs of SES technologies in three steps: First, the battery system size is optimized depending on the depth-of-discharge and round-trip efficiency. Second, technical and application input parameters are used to calculate the LCOE. Third, a Monte Carlo simulation is employed to account for the uncertainty present in the main technical input parameters, repeatedly recalculating the LCOE with different sets of random draws from the stochastic input parameters. The final result of this model is a set of LCOE distributions (one for each combination of technology and application) additionally highlighting the impact of depth-of-discharge optimization and reduction in financing costs. 3.2 Paper 2 - Techno-economic and market-value modeling of SES profitability In order to derive implications for an efficient implementation of deployment policies, the second paper develops the multi-purpose character of SES and analyzes the profitability of one SES technology in five different applications. Vanadium-redox-flow batteries are employed as a case example since this technology is especially well-suited to serve both high-power and high-energy applications due to its specific design (Dunn et al., 2011). 20 The five applications analyzed were End- consumer Arbitrage, Wholesale Arbitrage, Increase of Self-consumption, End-consumer Power Reliability and Area & Frequency Regulation. The multi-purpose character of SES technologies is derived based on a literature review of SES applications. Subsequently, expert interviews are used to develop and validate the economic framework of SES applications structured along the dimensions that define applications of multi- purpose technologies (source of value generation and customer / user group). To calculate the profitability of SES technologies across applications, Paper 2 expands the probabilistic techno-economic model employed in Paper 1 with an application-side simulation of the value generated by the SES technology. To this end, a new heuristic to estimate the value of SES technologies across applications is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a hierarchical, two-step heuristic (cf. Figure 3) is developed to decide on the value estimation approach, stating that the “economic evaluation of SES applications should generally be based on price signals from markets or contracts, or – in case no price signals exist – on the minimum of the inherent value of the application and the costs of the cheapest non-storage technology” (Paper 2). 21 operations & maintenance costs). The application parameters (required power rating, required energy rating, discharge duration, cycle frequency, discount rate, electricity price) were all deterministic. 20 In contrast to competing battery technologies, vanadium-redox-flow batteries store the energy in external tanks allowing a completely independent scaling of energy and power capacity of the battery system (Dunn et al., 2011). 21 The inherent value of a technology in a given application describes the economic effect of this technology. For instance, the inherent value of SES in End-consumer Power Reliability is the avoided loss from a power outage (“value of lost load”). 24 FIGURE 4: SELECTION HEURISTIC FOR ECONOMIC VALUE CALCULATION OF SES APPLICATIONS The technical input parameters for the profitability calculation are based on Paper 1, while the application and economic input parameters used in the value calculation are retrieved from literature supplemented with data from energy markets (e.g., European Energy Exchange (EEX)). The main result of this model is a set of distributions reflecting the profitability of vanadium-redox-flow batteries across SES applications. 3.3 Paper 3 – Econometric regression analysis of patent data In order to improve the understanding of knowledge diffusion within and across technologies in general, and in order to assess the risk of a lock-in for battery technologies specifically, Paper 3 investigates the determinants of technological knowledge diffusion across batteries. In particular, it strives to explain which kind of knowledge is likely to remain within the same technology and which kind of knowledge is likely to spill over across technologies (i.e., to explain the determinants of the direction of knowledge flows). To this end, the technological knowledge is differentiated along two dimensions. The first characteristic of the knowledge describes the degree of specialization and differentiates between specialized knowledge (building mainly on prior art, i.e., prior existing knowledge, from the same technological domain) and diversified knowledge (building mainly on prior art from different technological domains). The second characteristic describes the centrality of the knowledge itself and distinguishes between knowledge focused on core parts of a technology (i.e., core knowledge) or on peripheral parts of a technology (i.e., peripheral knowledge). Do price signals from markets or contracts exist for the application? …price signals from markets or contracts for this application Evaluation of the economic value of an stationary electricity storage application based on… …the costs of the best non-storage technology to fulfill the application …the inherent value of this application Is inherent value of the application higher than the costs of the best non-storage technology? No Yes Yes No 1 2 25 To explore its research question, Paper 3 analyzes patent data on battery technologies (lithium-ion, lead-acid, and nickel batteries) consisting of 42,619 patents and covering the time period between 1980 and 2010. The data were retrieved employing an iterative search algorithm that combined keywords with patent classes. The Thomson Innovation database was selected as a data source due to its global coverage, translated patent abstracts and provision of Derwent’s Electrical and Chemical Patents Index (EPI and CPI) Manual Codes. The dependent variable, knowledge flows, is measured using forward citations of patents and differentiates between Intra-technology knowledge flows (i.e., within the same battery technologies), Inter-technology knowledge flows (i.e., between two battery technologies) and External knowledge flows (i.e., towards non-battery technologies). For the first independent variable, the Degree of specialization of knowledge, backward citations of a patent were divided into Technologically near, related and distant prior art. To construct the second independent variable, Centrality of knowledge, the patent was classified into one of four product architecture levels (Materials, Principal components, Cell system, Additional components) leveraging information codified in the Derwent’s Manual Codes. Finally, in accordance with previous literature on knowledge diffusion, a standard set of controls is employed in the analysis (battery type, triadic patent, priority date, and mean backward citation lag). A negative binomial regression technique is used to analyze the patent data since the dependent variable (knowledge flows measured using the number of forward citations) can be described as count data. The overdispersion of the dependent variable is modeled as a function of the mean and heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation-robust standard errors are used across all regressions. Finally, multiple sensitivities are conducted which control for an alternative time period and citation window, an alternative regression technique (zero-inflated negative binomial regression), an alternative assignment method of patents to product architecture levels and an alternative source of the citation information (i.e., only citations added by the inventor). 3.4 Paper 4 - Techno-economic and actor-based modeling of investment decisions in SES under uncertainty In order to derive implications for deployment policies for multi-purpose technologies that reduce the risk of a premature lock-in, Paper 4 investigates the competition among four SES technologies in the market. To this end, an actor-based model is used to simulate investment decisions in SES technologies across applications. While the technical scope follows Paper 1 (i.e., lithium-ion, lead-acid, sodium-sulfur, and vanadium- redox-flow batteries), a different approach is used with respect to the applications under analysis. Since the exact characteristics of SES applications are both uncertain and vary over time, the competition among SES technologies is calculated across all possible applications instead of across 26 only a selected number of applications. For this purpose, the competition among SES technologies is assessed in a two-dimensional matrix (“application landscape”) that spans the technical parameters of discharge duration and cycle frequency. These two technical parameters are chosen to define the application landscape since they have, on average, the highest impact on life-cycle costs of SES technologies among all application parameters. The applications defined by the economic framework of SES application can be located within the application landscape (cf. Figure 6, section 4.4). The actor-based model calculates the degree of competition among SES technologies in four steps. First, to account for the uncertainty in cost and performance of battery technologies, each of the 10,000 actors draws values independently and at random from the main input parameter distributions (i.e., as a result each actor has a specific set of technical input values). Second, each actor calculates the life-cycle costs (in terms of Levelized Costs of Electric Capacity, LCOEC) of all four battery technologies for each spot in the application landscape (i.e., for each of 30,000 combinations of discharge duration and cycle frequency) using his/her set of technical input values. Third, for each spot in the applications landscape, each actor invests in the SES technology that exhibits – in his/her point of view – the lowest LCOEC. Finally, the model calculates the degree of competition among SES technologies based on the investment decision of the actors. Specifically, the degree of competition among SES technologies is calculated as the share of investors that deviate from the investment decisions of the majority of investors, i.e. as the cumulative initial market shares of the technologies which are not perceived as, on average, most cost-competitive by the investors (cf. Formula 2). This metric is developed in this paper in order to assess the degree of competition at the top, i.e., between the leading technologies, and thus indicates the risk of a lock-in into one technology. ∑ (2) TCC: Technological competition coefficient #Investors deviating: Number of investors that deviate from the investment decisions of the majority of investors #Investors: Total number of investors N: Number of technological options, sorted by cost-competitiveness 2nd: Second most cost-competitive technological option 27 4. Results Building upon the previous sections’ description of the objectives and methodological approach, the present section describes the main results of the individual papers. 4.1 Paper 1 - A review and probabilistic model of life-cycle costs of stationary batteries in multiple applications Figure 4 displays the life-cycle costs in terms of Levelized Costs of Electricity (LCOE) of the four stationary battery technologies (lithium-ion, lead-acid, sodium-sulfur and vanadium-redox-flow) across six applications. Moreover, it indicates the impact of uncertainty in input parameters (black bars) as well as the impact of depth-of-discharge optimization and reduction in financing costs (i.e., discount rates). The results will be discussed in two steps. To begin, the focus is on the mean LCOE results, before the discussion shifts to distributions of LCOE results reflecting the uncertainty in input parameters. With respect to the mean LCOE results, four specific findings are highlighted in the following: First, the four stationary battery technologies analyzed are still expensive. In comparison to average (2011) European electricity prices on the wholesale level (0.044 EUR/kWh) and retail level (0.172 EUR/kWh), adding electrochemical storage to the electricity value chain would increase the cost considerably, since the lowest mean LCOE value across technologies and applications is at 0.18 EUR/kWh. 22 Second, the mean LCOE varies strongly across technologies and applications. For instance, for the same application, Area and Frequency Regulation, the mean LCOE of lithium-ion (0.80 EUR/kWh) is about a third of the mean LCOE of lead-acid (2.10 EUR/kWh). Moreover, across applications, the mean LCOE of one technology can vary from 0.24 EUR/kWh in Utility Energy Time- shift to 2.10 EUR/kWh in Area and Frequency Regulation. Third, the ranking of technologies differs strongly across applications. While, for example, lithium-ion leads in power applications, sodium- sulfur exhibits the lowest LCOE for large-scale energy applications and lead-acid is the most cost- effective for small scale energy applications. Fourth, battery LCOE can be decreased significantly by depth-of-discharge optimization (e.g., by 9% for sodium-sulfur in Energy Management) and by a four- percentage point reduction in the discount rate (e.g., by 16% for lithium-ion in Increase of Self- consumption). 22 Yet note that the effect on the retail electricity prices would be considerably smaller compared to the SES LCOE as only a minor share of all electricity needs be stored. 28 FIGURE 5: LIFE-CYCLE COSTS (LCOE) BY APPLICATION AND TECHNOLOGY With respect to the distribution of the mean LCOE results, three outcomes shall be briefly discussed. Firstly, the impact of uncertainty on the main technical input parameters is very high. The 95% error bars reflecting the distribution of the mean LCOE range, on average, from 65% to 153% percent of the mean LCOE value. Second, as a consequence of the high amount of uncertainty in input parameters, the difference between the mean LCOE of the leading technology and the second one is not significant at any conventional significance level. In other words, in none of the investigated application does a clear leading technology exist. Third, lithium-ion exhibits the highest degree of uncertainty in input Support of Voltage Regulation Area and Frequency Regulation Increase of Self-consumption Energy Management (community scale) T&D Investment Deferral Utility Energy Time-shift EUR/kWh 2.252.001.751.501.251.000.750.500.250 DOD-optimized Discount rate reduction (from 8% to 6%) Discount rate reduction (from 8% to 4%) 60% DOD 60% DOD 50% DOD 55% DOD 60% DOD 60% DOD Lead-acid Sodium-sulfur Lithium-ion Vanadium redox flow 0.24 0.46 0.18 0.26 0,28 0.27 0.39 0.67 0.25 0.27 0.17 0.18 0.33 0.79 0.36 0.51 2.10 0.80 0.81 1.11 1.17 0.98 1.28 1.52 95% error bars (3,65) 29 parameters, while sodium-sulfur exhibits the lowest. Given the immaturity of stationary lithium-ion batteries as well as the multitude of sub-technologies and developers for this technology, this result is in line with the hypothesis. In summary, the main results of this paper are i) the high costs of SES in general, ii) the variation of costs across technologies and applications, and iii) the high level of uncertainty still present in SES technologies. Consequently, policy makers should be aware of two points: First, no single SES technology is the “silver bullet” in the transition to a more sustainable energy system, but rather a set of technologies is best suited to enable the integration of high shares of renewable energy technology. Second, given the variation in life-cycle costs across applications, the cost of deployment policies may also vary across applications. By incorporating the economic value across applications, Paper 2 builds upon this finding in order to develop an efficient deployment support strategy. 4.2 Paper 2 - Efficient demand-pull policies for multi-purpose technologies In response to the findings of Paper 1, which indicate high costs of SES in general, but also a high variation of costs across applications, Paper 2 investigates if and how policy makers can implement an efficient deployment support strategy. The results of Paper 2 can be divided into two areas. The first is the derivation of the multi-purpose character of SES by introducing the economic framework of SES applications (cf., Figure 2). The second area is the modeling results of the profitability of vanadium- redox-flow across five different SES applications. Since section 2.2.2 already described SES as a multi-purpose technology, the present section centers only on the profitability assessment. Figure 5 shows the modeling results by depicting the profitability distributions of vanadium-redox- flow across applications. Three findings shall be pointed out in the following: First, the mean profitability values of vanadium-redox-flow are negative across all applications, i.e., the value generated by the technologies does not cover the costs. This underlines the fact that without policy intervention, a diffusion of this technology is impeded by the currently low attractiveness for private investors. Second, the main profitability varies strongly across applications. While the high-energy applications (End-consumer Arbitrage and Wholesale Arbitrage) are far away from any positive return for investors, Area & Frequency Regulation is considerably closer to profitability. Also, Increase of Self-consumption, an application on which several current policy support schemes center (Borden and Schill, 2013; KfW, 2013; PV-Tech, 2014), exhibits relatively attractive economics compared to other applications. Third, the level of uncertainty also varies across applications. Generally, frequently used applications (e.g., Area & Frequency Regulation) or applications with long discharge durations (e.g., Wholesale Arbitrage) have a higher uncertainty because the technical parameters, cycle lifetime and energy-related investment costs are main drivers of uncertainty. Moreover, the value of applications estimated based on price signals (e.g., Wholesale Arbitrage) have a lower uncertainty compared to the 30 value of applications estimated on the minimum of inherent value and costs of competing non-storage alternatives (e.g., End-consumer Power Reliability). Yet, as a rule, the uncertainty in technical input parameters outweighs the uncertainty on the value side. On a more abstract level, the main result of this paper is that policy makers can – due to the multiple applications of energy storage and the strong variation of the profitability across these applications – implement an efficient deployment support strategy. This strategy is described in chapter 5.

For this purpose, two sets of explanatory factors were included in the analysis – both describe the characteristics of the knowledge in focus. The results of the analysis are discussed in the following. With respect to the first explanatory factor, the degree of specialization, we find that specialized knowledge (i.e., knowledge that integrates a high amount of prior art from the same technological domain) is more likely to remain within the same technology and less likely to spill across technologies compared to diversified knowledge (i.e., knowledge that integrates a high amount of prior art from distant technological domains). With respect to the second explanatory factor, the degree of centrality of knowledge, our findings indicate that knowledge that focuses on core parts of a technology (i.e., core knowledge) is more likely to remain within the same technology and less likely to spill over across technologies compared to knowledge that centers on peripheral parts of a technology (i.e., peripheral knowledge). The control variables included in the analysis (battery type, triadic patent, priority date, and mean backward citation lag) are mostly highly significant and in line with previous research on knowledge diffusion. These results are robust across all sensitivities. Changing the time period analyzed (to 1985 - 2005), the origin of the citation information (only inventor citations), the assignment method of patents to product architecture level (multiple assignments) and the regression estimation technique (zero- inflated negative binomial), does not create conflicting evidence. Moreover, these results are in line with the theoretical reasoning supporting the hypotheses derived in this paper. Specifically, the predicted effects based on the literature on specialization (Cantner and Graf, 2004; Lettl et al., 2009), recombinant search (Gilfillan, 1935; Nelson and Winter, 1982; Fleming, 2001; Arthur, 2009), core components (Tushman and Rosenkopf, 1992; Murmann and Frenken, 2006) and modularity (Ulrich, 1995; Baldwin and Clark, 2000) are observable in our analysis. Specifically, our analysis shows that these constructs, which were often posed in opposition in previous research, can complement each other when knowledge flows are differentiated by their direction. In contrast to previous research on the technological knowledge diffusion, which analyzed only the total number of knowledge flows, the present contributions differentiate the knowledge flows depending on the recipient technologies in order to investigate the determinates of the direction of knowledge flows. To highlight the effect of this novel approach, the findings of the differentiated perspective are contrasted with results of a pooled regression on the total number of knowledge flows. 32 In this pooled regression, none of the described theoretical constructs becomes visible. The aggregated effect of the pooled perspective levels out any specific dynamics that govern knowledge flows depending on their direction. Consequently, the findings of this paper underline the relevance of differentiating knowledge flows by their direction as different causal mechanism determine knowledge flows within and across technologies. On a more practical level, these findings underline the risk of a lock-in in the case of deployment policies for two reasons. First, the amount of inter-technology knowledge spillovers between competing battery technologies is generally very low compared to the knowledge flows within the same technology. Second, the analysis indicates that core and specialized knowledge is more likely to stay within the same technology than peripheral and diversified knowledge. As strong deployment policies for a specific technology are likely to generate more specialized knowledge and core knowledge in the respective technology, the risk of a technological lock-in is even more pronounced. This finding emphasizes the need for deployment policies that are designed in a way that counterbalances the lock-in risk and thus motivates Paper 4. 4.4 Paper 4 - Avoiding a premature technology lock-in through deployment policies – A simulation of investment decisions in technologies with multiple applications Responding to the findings of Paper 3, which highlighted the lock-in risk in the case of deployment policies, Paper 4 investigates the competition among SES technologies in the market to derive implications for deployment policies that avoid a premature technological lock-in. In order to assess the competition among SES technologies, the investment decisions of independent actors were simulated. Figure 6 displays the results of this simulation across the application landscape by showing the degree of competition as the share of the investors that deviate from the decision of the majority of investors (Technological competition coefficient (TCC)). A high TCC value represented by a warm color in Figure 6 indicates a low lock-in risk since several technologies have a fair chance to prevail in the market. Moreover, Figure 6 shows the leading technology for each combination of discharge, duration and cycle frequency, and indicates the location of several prominent SES applications. In the following section, two main results shall be briefly discussed. First, Figure 6 shows that each investigated SES technology is the leading technology for its specific area in the application landscape. Specifically, lithium-ion is the first choice of investors for applications with a short discharge duration (i.e., with a high ratio of required power to required energy capacity). Lead-acid is the leading technology for applications with longer discharge durations but only a few cycles per day. With increasing cycle frequency, the advantage shifts from sodium- sulfur (for applications with roughly 0.75 to 2 cycles a day) to vanadium-redox-flow (for applications with more than 2 cycles a day). This finding confirms that even from a static cost-performance 33 perspective, a variety of SES technologies is best suited to the various purposes SES can serve in the energy system. FIGURE 7: DEGREE OF COMPETITION AMONG BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES IN THE SES APPLICATIONS LANDSCAPE Second, the degree of competition varies strongly across the application landscape. While some areas – and thus some applications – are marked by a high degree of competition among technologies, in other areas a clearly leading technology exists. Close to the center of the application landscape is the area with the highest degree of competition among the four technologies. A deployment policy focusing on applications near this area would entail a low risk of a lock-in. Moving away from this area increases the lock-in risk since the degree of competition among technologies gets lower at the border of the landscape, where typically one specific technology enjoys a clear advantage. The implications for policy makers are discussed in section 5. a Share of actors who deviate from the majority investment decision (Technological competition coefficient (TCC)) Cycle frequencyDischarge duration monthly weekly daily 1/2 1 2 4 hourly 1 5 10 30 min h 2 4 8Degree of competitiona Sodium- sulfur Vanadium redox flow Lead-acid Lithium-ion A C D HIGH LOCK-IN RISK HIGH LOCK-IN RISK HIGH LOCK-IN RISK LOW LOCK-IN RISKB End-consumer ArbitrageCA Support of Voltage Regulation Wholesale Arbitrage DB End-consumer Power Reliability 34 5. Conclusion The objective of this dissertation is to shed light on the question of how policy makers can implement deployment policies for multi-purpose technologies while limiting the costs of these policies and maintaining technological diversity. This section synthesizes the key methodological (5.1) and theoretical contributions (5.2). Then, implications for practitioners and policy makers are derived (5.3), before this dissertation concludes with promising avenues for subsequent research (5.4). 5.1 Methodological contributions Three methodological contributions of this dissertation are highlighted briefly in the following section. First, Paper 2 developed a heuristic to estimate the economic value generated by stationary electricity storage devices across applications (cf. section 3.2). Previous publications on the economic value of SES can be divided into two streams: On one side, detailed analyses published in peer-reviewed technical or economic journals employ advanced modeling techniques to estimate the value of SES in one specific application (e.g., Benitez et al. (2008), Sioshansi et al. (2009)). On the other side, independently published reports typically assess the value of SES across multiple applications, yet employ rather simple methods (e.g., EPRI (2010), Schoenung and Eyer (2008)). However, an overarching methodology to estimate the value of SES across applications has not been developed by any publication thus far; the heuristic proposed in Paper 2 addresses this gap. Second, Paper 4 proposed, with the Technological competition coefficient, an indicator to assess the risk of locking-in a technology (cf. section 3.4). While existing metrics to describe the variation of values, e.g., the variance of standard deviation, typically focus on the variation compared to the mean, the TCC focuses on the variation at the top, i.e., between the leading technologies. This focus makes the TCC a well-suited indicator to assess the risk of a lock-in, since the competition among the leading technologies is decisive in this risk. For instance, in the case where one technology is leading by far while several others are in close competition for second place, a variance or a standard deviation would indicate a high degree of competition (i.e., a low lock-in risk), while the TCC would correctly point out a high lock-in risk due to the clear lead of one technology. The third methodological contribution resulted from Paper 3. In order to investigate the impact of the centrality of knowledge on the likelihood of generating knowledge flows within and across technologies, this paper leveraged information codified in Derwent’s Chemical and Electrical Patent Index Manual Codes. 23 To this end, these Manual Codes were employed to classify each patent, 23 Because they describe the central inventive aspect of a patent, these Manual Codes could be employed to approximate the product architecture level on which the patent focuses. To this end, two researchers independently assigned 433 Manual 35 indicating a piece of knowledge, into the product architecture levels which were, in turn, ordered along their centrality to the system. This procedure – to operationalize the centrality of knowledge employing Manual Codes assigned to product architecture levels – is unprecedented in literature. 5.2 Theoretical contributions The theoretical contributions of this dissertation can broadly be divided into two areas. The first area comprises the introduction of the multi-purpose technology concept and its implications. The second area encompasses the insights gained on the determinants of knowledge diffusion within and across technologies. 5.2.1 The concept of multi-purpose technologies (MPTs) In the course of this dissertation, the concept of multi-purpose technologies (MPT) was introduced (cf. section 2.2). Specifically, Paper 2 defined a MPT as “a technology that has several distinct, economically relevant applications primarily focused on one or a few sectors, yet lacks the technological complementarities of general-purpose technologies.” While several studies have used this term for various technologies (Dolata, 2009; Holm-Nielsen et al., 2009; Kleine, 2010), it was never defined in such a way as to differentiate it from single- and general-purpose technologies. Moreover, an application, as the central identifying characteristic of a MPT, was defined as having a unique combination of source of value creation and customer / user group. Thereby, applications of MPTs were identified from a market perspective since the proposed definition implies that each application exhibits different value drivers, different demand side factors and different competing technologies. This notion bears implications for both the literature on technological evolution and for policy makers. Since each application can be conceptualized as a niche market, a MPT can develop simultaneously or sequentially in different applications (cf. Kemp et al. (1998), Nill and Kemp (2009)). Moreover, this definition also implies that policy makers can implement deployment policies, which aim to foster the demand for a technology in a market, for a MPT specific to its applications. In other words, policy makers can decide on which application the deployment of a MPT should be incentivized.24 The existence of technologies with multiple distinct applications also leads to implications for the debate on neutrality and specificity of deployment policies on a more abstract level. The question of whether deployment policies should be technology-neutral (e.g., economy-wide price instruments that affect all technologies in a given field) or, rather, technology-specific (i.e., a specific feed-in tariff for Codes to the four product architecture levels: Materials, Principal Components, Cell Systems, Additional Components. Subsequently, these product architecture levels were ordered, using expert interviews, by their centrality to the system. 24 Paper 4 discussed in more detail the criteria on which policy makers can base their decision. 36 wind offshore) is discussed by both scholars and practitioners (van der Zwaan et al., 2002; del Río González, 2008; Gross et al., 2012; Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte, 2014). However, recently, Azar and Sanden (2011, p. 137) advanced this dicussion by arguing that the “debate about whether these policies should be technology specific becomes rather meaningless, and should be replaced by a discussion about how technology specific the policies should be.\" In other words, deployment policies are neither technology-neutral nor technology-specific, but can be differentiated by their degree of specificity. Paper 4 combines this notion on the specificity of deployment policies with the concept of MPTs. In particular, it postulates that policy makers have to decide on the specificity of deployment policies not only with respect to the technology dimension, but also with respect to the application dimension. 25 Deployment policies can be limited to a specific application (e.g., pay-for-performance fee for fast spinning energy devices employed in spinning reserve), comprise several applications (e.g., investment grant for PV-connected battery storage with grid connection), or be completely independent from any application (e.g., carbon tax on hydrocarbon fuels). Consequently, policy makers have to decide how specific the deployment policy shall be with respect to both the technologies and the application covered. Figure 7 depicts the resulting decision space for policy makers graphically. FIGURE 8: DECISION SPACE FOR POLICY MAKERS WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFICITY OF DEPLOYMENT POLICIES 25 The technology-specificity can be differentiated broadly into six levels (economy, sector, technological field, technology, sub-technology, technological design). Application dimension Neutral Application- specific Technology- specific Technology dimension (I) Carbon tax on hydrocarbon fuels, Norway 1991 Examples (IV) Investment grant for PV- connected battery storage with grid connection (KfW 275), Germany 2013 (V) Investment grant for lithium- ion batteries in grid-connected applications (METI), Japan 2014 (II) Pay-for-performance for fast responding energy devices employed for spinning reserve (FERC Order 755), USA 2011 (III) Loan guarantee for advanced clean energy technologies (DOE 1705), USA 2009 37 5.2.2 Knowledge diffusion and technological evolution The second theoretical area to which this dissertation contributes is related to the literature on technological knowledge diffusion in particular, and to technological evolution in general. Paper 3 investigated which characteristics of knowledge increase the likelihood of knowledge flows within or across technologies. Three specific theoretical contributions of this paper shall be presented briefly. First, by introducing a differentiated perspective on the direction of knowledge flows, Paper 3 developed two distinct set of hypotheses: one for knowledge flows within the same technology and one for knowledge flows across technologies. This approach showed that the theoretical constructs on value of specialization (Cantner and Graf, 2004; Lettl et al., 2009) and of cumulative synthesis (Gilfillan, 1935; Nelson and Winter, 1982; Fleming, 2001; Arthur, 2009) do not contradict each other, but rather complement each other when the knowledge flows are differentiated by their direction. Moreover, the results of the analysis allowed for the resolution of inconclusive empirical evidence of previous studies on knowledge diffusion. Second, Paper 3 contributes to literature by bridging the previously distinct streams of knowledge diffusion and product architecture. Employed in this paper to approximate the centrality of knowledge, the concept of product architecture has proven its value to diverse areas, such as technological development (Murmann and Frenken, 2006; Winskel et al., 2013), firm performance (Ulrich, 1995) and organizational and industry structure (Henderson and Clark, 1990; Fixson and Park, 2008). However, it has not thus far been used in the context of knowledge diffusion. Both the theoretical reasoning in Paper 3 and the results of its analysis lend weight to the significance of product architecture in the rate and direction of technological knowledge flows. Third, based on the findings that core and specialized knowledge have, when compared to diversified and peripheral knowledge, a higher likelihood of generating knowledge flows within a technology and lower likelihood of generating knowledge flows across technologies, Paper 3 developed implications for the literature on technological evolution. On the one hand, it underlined the self-reinforcing character of specialization (cf. Dosi (1982)) and showed how the dominant design of a technology is shaped by its core components (cf. Murmann and Frenken (2006)). On the other hand, it showed that a broader set of technologies can benefit from the inter-technology spillovers that result from diversified and peripheral knowledge. As a consequence, the findings of Paper 3 point to the fact that specialized and core knowledge are likely to reinforce the existing technological trajectories, while diversified and peripheral knowledge may help to increase technological variety. 38 5.3 Implications for practitioners and policy makers This section discusses the implications for practitioners and policy makers that result from this dissertation. It begins with a brief overview of the data and insights generated that are relevant for practitioners working in the area of stationary electricity storage (SES). Afterwards, the implications for policy makers are derived with respect to the two specific objectives of this dissertation: Limiting costs of deployment support and maintaining technological diversity. The section concludes with in a short discussion on balancing both objectives and feasibility of implementation. 5.3.1 Data and analyses on applications and economics of SES Practitioners may benefit from the results developed by this dissertation in the context of the applications and economics of SES.26 Specifically, the input data on battery costs and performance retrieved in a comprehensive literature review and validated by a series of expert interviews may represent an important data source for practitioners in this area (Paper 1). Moreover, the comparative analysis of performance adjusted life-cycle costs of batteries (Paper 1), as well as the simulation results on economic value and profitability (Paper 2), has proved to be of high relevance for firms and policy makers. Furthermore, the economic framework defining SES applications, which points out the value creation mechanism of the applications, may be useful for practitioners that strive to develop new markets (Paper 2). Finally, both investors and project developers may be interested in the analysis presented in Paper 4, which depicts the leading technology and its competitive situation depending on technical characteristics of the application served (cf. Figure 6). 5.3.2 Limit costs of deployment polices From a policy perspective, the present dissertation strived to offer advice on deployment policies for technologies with multiple applications. The first specific objective was to contribute to the understanding of how policy makers can implement deployment policies for multi-purpose technologies while limiting the cost of these policies. To this end, Paper 1 not only underlines the relevance of this objective by emphasizing the high costs of SES across applications, it also outlines options to reduce these costs. Specifically, it shows that governments can considerably reduce the costs of SES installations, and thereby incentivize its deployment, if they are able to decrease an investor’s financing costs. This can be achieved, for instance, by support of demonstration projects, which aim to reduce the inherent uncertainty in costs and performance of SES technology and thus 26 In fact, the results of this dissertation on applications and economics of SES technologies were presented in several invited talks (e.g., International Renewable Energy Conference, Berlin, 2013; Vattenfall Innovation, Hamburg, 2013), fed into an industry report on power-to-gas, as well as were discussed in an expert workshop hosted by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris, 2013 (which lead to IEA Technology Roadmap – Energy Storage (IEA, 2014)). 39 result in lower financing costs. Moreover, subsidized credit schemes or loan guarantees which would pool risks and thus reduce the financing costs for investors are further options. Building upon the results of Paper 1, Paper 2 shows how policy makers can make use of the multi- purpose character of SES in order to further reduce the costs of deployment polices. In contrast to technologies that have one dominant application (or an almost unlimited number of applications lacking clear borders between them), in the case of MPTs, policy makers have the option to select an application for deployment support. This option to choose between different applications becomes especially valuable for policy makers in cases where the profitability of the technology to be supported varies strongly across applications. Since the costs of deployment support are directly or indirectly a function of the gap-to-profitability (cf. section 2.5.1), varying profitability of a MPT across applications translates into varying costs of deployment support. The simulation results of Paper 2 highlight the strong variation in profitability across SES applications (cf. section 3.2). Consequently, in the case of SES, policy makers can reduce the costs of deployment support by sequentially supporting the deployment in applications based on their profitability. Figure 8 exemplifies the proposed strategy using the concept of learning curves.27 Assuming the application C is needed most in the long run from a systemic perspective (e.g., integration of renewables), policy makers can initially support application A, which exhibits relatively attractive economics. As soon as the costs of the technology is reduced, due to, for instance, technical change and economies-of-scale, the policy support can be switched to application B and finally to application C. In this way, the total costs of deployment policy per installed unit of SES can be reduced. 27 Learning curves approximate the development of the costs of technology as a function of its deployment in the market, thereby incorporating technological innovation through learning-by-doing and –by-using as well as economies-of-scale (Jamasb, 2007; Yeh and Rubin, 2012). 40 FIGURE 9: EFFICIENT DEPLOYMENT SUPPORT FOR A MULTI-PURPOSE TECHNOLOGY 5.3.3 Maintain technological diversity The second specific objective of this dissertation is to improve the understanding of how policy makers can implement deployment policies for multi-purpose technologies while maintaining technological diversity. The relevance of this objective was highlighted by Paper 3. By showing that the degree to which knowledge spills over between related technologies is very low in general, and that specialized knowledge and core knowledge are even less likely to be transferred across technologies, Paper 3 demonstrated the risk of a lock-in through deployment policies. The established technological trajectories are reinforced by any government intervention that fosters the creation of highly specialized knowledge on core components of technologies. Deployment policies which benefit mainly one technology are likely to have such effects. Conversely, policy efforts that increase the amount of diversified and peripheral knowledge (e.g., support of systemic solutions or interdisciplinary research teams) have a lower likelihood of locking-in specific technologies due to the inter-technology spillovers generated by both kinds of knowledge. Consequently, policy makers need to be aware of which technologies benefit from the deployment policies and which kind of technological knowledge is likely to be generated. Policy makers have several options to respond to the risk of locking-in specific technologies through deployment policies in case of multi-purpose technologies. Besides fostering the creation of diversified and peripheral knowledge, they can i) implement deployment support for an application Cost of demand-pull policy Deployment (installed capacity) Application A Application B Application C Technology cost / value of applicationa a Normalized economic value per installed unit of technology that can be achieved by the investor or operator of the MPT (excl. positive and negative externalities) Application A Market is working without policy support Deployment of technology in… Application B Application C 41 which exhibits a high degree of competition, ii) support several applications in parallel though different policy instruments, or iii) adapt the specificity of the deployment policy with respect to applications or technologies. First, by implementing deployment support for an application with a high degree of competition among technologies, policy makers create a “level playing field” ensuring that several technologies have a realistic chance to be adopted in the market. Second, in case deployment support for the application with a high degree of competition is not feasible, or in case no such application exists, policy makers can support several applications with distinct deployment instruments in parallel. By implementing deployment support for several application in which different technologies lead, a lock-in into one specific technology can be avoided as well. Third, by decreasing the specificity of deployment policies with respect to the applications covered (e.g., investment grant for SES – without any constraints of the application served) or by increasing the specificity with respect to the technologies covered (e.g., incentive for lithium-ion batteries employed in Area & Frequency Regulation) policy makers can also reduce the risk of locking-in one specific technology.28 However, two caveats should be emphasized. First, the market size of an application is an important factor affecting the likelihood of locking-in technologies. Technological innovation and cost reductions resulting from, among others, economies of scale, learning-by-doing, and learning-by-using, depend on the deployment of the technologies in the market. Therefore, policy makers have to take into account the market size of applications when implementing several deployment policies targeted on different applications.29 Second, policy makers have to distinguish between initially avoiding a lock-in into one technology, and maintaining technological diversity in the long-run. For the former it is sufficient to create a level playing field for several technologies by supporting an application with a high degree of competition or by supporting several applications in parallel. However, as different technologies exhibit different learning speeds and potentials, one technology might outperform the other and could thus lock-out the other technologies in the long-run. Consequently, to maintain technological diversity in the long-run policy intervention needs to be reviewed and adapted regularly. 5.3.4 Discussion - Balancing both objectives and hurdles to implementation This section aims to shed light on how both specific objectives – limiting the cost of deployment policies and maintaining technological diversity – interact. Moreover, several caveats shall briefly be discussed which could impact for the practical implementation of deployment policies. 28 A precondition for less application-specific deployment policies, which avoid the risk of locking-in one technology, is that through the deployment policies diffusion is enabled in several applications in which different technologies are most cost- competitive. 29 One option for policy makers to respond to different market sizes is to cap the deployment policy in the larger application. 42 “If diversity is made explicit, it is often posed as conflicting with the goal of efficiency” (van den Bergh, 2008, p. 565). In the following, it will be argued that the assessment of the validity of this statement with respect to deployment policies depends on assumed time horizon. In the short run, the objectives of efficiency and technological diversity, can, but don’t have to, be posed in opposition. While Paper 2 showed that the profitability of MPTs could vary across applications, Paper 4 highlighted that different applications exhibit a very different degree of competition among technologies. In case the most attractive application in terms of profitability exhibits a high degree of competition among several technologies, both objectives are well aligned as deployment support, for this application would contribute to both objectives. However, in cases where several applications need to be supported in parallel because the most profitable one exhibits a low degree of competition, both objectives are posed in opposition. With an increasing number of supported applications necessary to maintain technological diversity, the average costs of deployment policies, as well as the complexity and administrative burden, increase. 30 In the long run, both the value of technological diversity and the costs necessary to maintain it rise. On one side, as it is highly unlikely that one application exhibits a continuously high degree of competition among several technologies, policy makers will likely have to support several applications in parallel or increase the technology-specificity of deployment support in order to maintain technological diversity. Both options will increase the costs of deployment support. 31 Moreover, a lock-in into one technology accelerates learning and innovation (e.g., economies of scale, due to learning-by-doing and –using) within this technology as all firms in the economy focus on the same technology. This aspect represents the opportunity costs of technological diversity and need to be taken into consideration when deciding on the targeted level of technological diversity. On the other side, the value of technological diversity increases in the long run as its positive effect resulting from a more resilient system as well as from inter-technology spillovers and endogenous learning become apparent (Stirling, 2007; van den Bergh, 2008). Whether the value of technological diversity outweighs the costs that need to be incurred in order to maintain it is not in scope of this dissertation. However, it is clear that policy makers should not only focus on the costs necessary to maintain technological diversity, but they should also consider technological diversity as an “investment” for long-term efficiency and resilience of the system (van den Bergh, 2008). 30 In case of SES, the most profitable assessed applications are Area & Frequency Regulation and Increase of Self- consumption. While in the former one technology enjoys a clear lead, in the latter two technologies are in close competition from a cost / performance perspective (Figure 6). 31 The more applications need to be supported directly, the higher is the average gap-to-profitability across applications (assuming a sequential support based on the gap-to-profitability). With varying gap-to-profitability across technologies within a specific application, direct support of several technologies would increase costs of deployment policies. 43 Besides the interdependence between efficiency of deployment policies and technological diversity, four additional aspects that could affect the implementation of deployment policies shall be highlighted. First, besides efficiency of deployment policies and technological diversity, several other criteria exist that need to be taken into account for the selection of an application to be supported. The market size and growth of an application is not only highly relevant for both the costs of deployment policies and technological diversity, but also for the technological learning and innovation that can be realized through deployment in the respective application. Moreover, some applications might exhibit external effects that need to be considered. For instance, the strong deployment of solar PV in private households may entail considerable challenges for maintaining power quality on the distribution grid level (Bucher, 2014). Finally, political feasibility may vary across strongly across applications. Second, although the research question of this dissertation focused on deployment policies, in reality deployment policies are often combined with other instruments (Sorrell and Sijm, 2003). Recent studies have emphasized the importance of such a combination of instruments in a policy mix (Peters et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2012b). For instance, in order to maintain or increase technological diversity, it might be beneficial to complement deployment policies with research and development support for specific technologies (i.e., “technology-push instruments”) (Nemet, 2009). Consequently, the decision on the implementation of deployment policies depends on the interdependence of these instruments alongside others in the policy mix. Third, when implementing deployment policies, policy makers need to have a comprehensive perspective on the technology in focus. The development of a technology mainly employed in one sector might be affected by related technologies in other sectors. For instance, cost reductions in stationary batteries are partly driven by trends related to the electrification of the transport sector. Moreover, as in contrast to most deployment policies, technological evolution is not constrained by national borders, international spillovers need to be taken account for policy decisions (Peters et al., 2012). Finally, policy makers have to be aware of limitations with respect to information and rationality. Any decision they make is done on the basis of incomplete information – with respect to, among other, the future development of technologies and to the behavior of market participants. Furthermore, similar to decision makers in firms (and to any human being), policy makers are “bounded” in their rationality (March and Simon, 1958; Jones, 2003). Malerba (2009) underlines the relevance of not learning from mistakes, limited flexibility to adapt policies, misrepresentation of technologies, and coordination failures in terms of technology policy and government interventions. Krugman (1996) emphasizes the bad track record of governments in picking a winner. On the other side, any government intervention is associated with increased complexity and administrative burden. Moreover, the theory of the “second best” describes situations when the optimal solution is not achieved through the market 44 mechanisms (e.g., due to market failures in forms of negative externalities of conventional energy technologies), government interventions aiming to correct specific market failures may actually decrease the overall efficiency of the system (Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956). Consequently, although most scholars and practitioners seemed to be aligned on the necessity of government intervention to support clean energy technologies (Sagar and van der Zwaan, 2006; Gross et al., 2012), policy makers should base any decision on an appropriate level of “humbleness,” taking into account the limits in information and rationality. 5.4 Further research This dissertation is not free from limitations that indicate avenues for further research. The remainder of this section points to several practical and theoretical points that might be of particular interest for subsequent analysis. With respect to the phenomenon in focus of this dissertation – stationary electricity storage – subsequent research could improve the technical modeling of these technologies. For instance, future simulation tools could incorporate a non-linear cost structure controlling for economies-of-scale, the effect of environmental factors such as temperature and humidity on lifetime and performance, and the impact of variable charging and discharge speed on cycle lifetime. Moreover, several contributions indicated that stationary electricity storage might be able to serve several applications in parallel (Butler et al., 2002; Eyer and Corey, 2010), however a solid understanding of which applications can be combined and to what extent that can be done is missing. An improved knowledge of this aspect would be highly valuable for practitioners (as it has the potential to improve the business case of SES considerably) and for policy makers (as it has implications for the design of deployment policies). Regarding the first theoretical area to which this dissertation contributed – multi-purpose technologies – subsequent research should explore the implication of this concept for adjacent literature streams. For instance, this concept might be relevant for the literature on technological evolution, as technologies can develop simultaneously or sequentially in different applications. Also management literature might benefit from this notion as firms, particularly technology providers, might have additional options in their development and marketing strategy in the case of multi-purpose technologies. Moreover, as this dissertation focused on the implications of multiple applications for deployment policies, the specific design of deployment policies for multi-purpose technologies was not in scope. As the design of policies is found to be highly relevant for the effectiveness of policies (Kemp and Pontoglio, 2011), future research could extend the present work by investigating this aspect in detail. 45 Concerning the contribution of this dissertation on technological knowledge diffusion (Paper 3), the presented analysis could be built out by incorporating additional determinants for the direction of knowledge flows. For instance, geographic and firm level information were found to be relevant for knowledge diffusion in general and thus might also impact the direction of knowledge across technologies (Jaffe, 1993; Audretsch and Feldman, 1996). Finally, although stationary electricity storage, and batteries specifically, were well suited to investigate both the implications of the multi- purpose concept and the determinants of technological knowledge diffusion, subsequent research could validate and advance the presented analysis focusing on different technologies. 46 6.

The growing scientific literature on batteries reflects the high attention that currently rests on these technologies. This paper reviews the existing literature on lifecycle costs of batteries in stationary applications. The primary result of this review is that, despite the current high degree of variation in technological and economic battery data, a systematic assessment of the underlying uncertainty is lacking. The present paper addresses this disparity with an investigation of the impact of uncertainty in input parameters on lifecycle costs of four battery technologies across six electricity system applications. Based on input data collected from literature and via expert interviews, a probabilistic techno-economic model was built that calculates lifecycle costs and systematically addresses uncertainty in input parameters by applying a Monte Carlo simulation. The main conclusion of this paper is that the present uncertainty in cost and technical parameters of batteries exceeds by far the differences in lifecycle costs across technologies. For most electricity storage applications, the absolute differences in mean lifecycle costs across technologies are negligible compared to the uncertainty ranges of the mean lifecycle costs. Therefore, a competition still exists between the four analyzed battery technologies and so far a leading technology has yet to emerge in any of the investigated applications.

Introduction In order to cope with a rising electricity demand while also attempting to mitigate climate change, many governments have begun to introduce ambitious targets and incentives for the diffusion of renewable power generation technologies [1–4]. However, the non-deterministic and intermittent nature of wind and solar power generation – which are expected to contribute the majority of future renewable power generation – may entail serious challenges for the energy system [5,6]. Besides demand side management and grid expansion, energy storage technologies are promising response options due to their ability to decouple generation and load [7]. Within the field of energy storage technologies, electrochemical batteries have a potential to play an important role to pave the way towards an energy system with a high share of renewable power generation. First, due to their fast response time and scalability, battery technologies can serve both power and energy applications and thus cover a wide range of storage applications in the electricity system 32. Second, further advantages of battery technologies are that they can be centrally located or distributed, along with their suitability for on-, off-, and weak-grid applications [8]. While much attention rests on battery technologies, uncertainty about costs and performance of battery technologies is still impeding their large-scale deployment in the electricity system [9]. Four main factors drive this uncertainty. First, multiple battery technologies in various states of maturity with highly diverging performance characteristics compete in the market. Second, a complex set of electricity storage applications exists, ranging from power quality and reliability for end-consumers to renewables integration and ancillary services on the grid level [10]. Third, scientific sources investigating costs and performance of battery technologies are often inconsistent and exhibit high variations, even for main input parameters. Lastly, complicating this inconsistency, the actual costs of a battery system do not only depend on the technology parameters but also on the specific application in which the system is used [11]. While most literature on battery technologies compares the investment and operating costs, a fair basis for comparison of technologies should factor in lifecycle costs, as lifecycle costs vary depending on the specific application. Previous studies on storage lifecycle costs advanced the knowledge of battery costs and performance across applications. Yet, despite the present high degree of variation of input parameters in the literature – especially for immature technologies such as stationary lithium-ion and vanadium redox flow – uncertainty in input parameters has not been taken into account systematically. 32 In contrast, pumped hydro, compressed air energy storage and hydrogen storage are mostly suitable for long-term storage of large energy capacities (“energy applications”), whereas flywheels, supercapacitors and superconducting magnetic energy storage are rather considered for applications with a fast release of comparatively small amounts of energy (“power applications”) (Neupert et al., 2009; Manz and Keller, 2011). 62 In order to address this gap in the literature, the present paper investigates the impact of uncertainty in input parameters on lifecycle costs of battery technologies across electricity system applications. To this end, four battery technologies were analyzed within six stationary electricity storage applications in two steps 33. First, based on an extensive literature review and expert interviews, battery and application input values were derived. Second, a probabilistic techno-economic model was developed that calculates lifecycle costs and systematically addresses uncertainty in input parameters by conducting a Monte Carlo simulation. Thereby, this study strives to improve the understanding of battery costs and performance for researchers, practitioners and policy makers. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 shortly describes battery technologies and storage applications before reviewing the literature on lifecycle costs assessments of battery technologies. Section 3 explains the methodology and data used in the lifecycle costs modeling. The obtained results are presented and discussed in Section 4. Section 5 concludes by stating possible avenues for future research while summarizing the paper’s principle contributions. 2. Description of Battery Technologies and Applications; Review of Lifecycle Costs Assessments This section is comprised of two parts: A brief overview of battery technologies and their applications within the electricity system, followed by a review of previous literature on battery lifecycle costs. 2.1 Battery technologies and their role in the electricity system Generally, energy can be stored thermally (e.g., hot water tank), mechanically (e.g., pumped hydro storage, compressed air energy storage or flywheels), chemically (e.g., hydrogen), electrically (e.g., supercapacitors or superconducting magnetic energy storage) or electrochemically (e.g., batteries and flow batteries). The general principle behind the mechanism of a battery is as follows: As soon as a load is connected to the cell’s terminal, electrochemical reactions take place inside the cell in which electrons are set free and transferred from one electrode to another through an external electrical circuit. Depending on the required output voltage and energy capacity, single or multiple cells are connected within a series or in parallel, or both [12]. The manifold combinations of chemicals and materials used as electrodes, electrolytes or membranes span a wide spectrum of battery technologies: 33 We model lifecycle costs of lead-acid, lithium-ion, sodium-sulfur, and vanadium redox flow for the six applications Utility Energy Time-shift, T&D Investment Deferral, Energy Management (community scale), Increase of Self-consumption, Area and Frequency Regulation, and Support of Voltage Regulation. 63 From lead-acid, lithium-ion, nickel-metal hydride, nickel-cadmium, zinc-air to high-temperature batteries, such as sodium-sulfur or the so-called ZEBRA battery 34. Flow batteries store energy externally, i.e., the storage medium and the reaction cell (cell stack) are arranged separately [13]. In general, flow batteries consist of two electrolyte solutions – which are stored in external tanks if not in use – that are pumped into the cell stack to complete the redox reactions to create electricity [14]. Flow batteries are highly flexible and can easily be tailored for diverse applications because their energy capacity can be scaled up by either augmenting the volume or the concentration of electrolytes and because their power capacity can be increased by installing additional cell stacks [14]. The materials and chemicals used in flow batteries can vary from vanadium, polysulfide-bromide, zinc-cerium, and iron-chromium to zinc-bromine. This paper focuses specifically upon the four battery technologies – lead-acid, lithium-ion, sodium- sulfur and vanadium redox flow batteries – that are generally perceived as promising technologies with a significant potential for grid-scale electricity storage [14,15]. Moreover, these technologies are either mature (sodium-sulfur and lead-acid) or first commercial products are available (lithium-ion35 and vanadium redox flow), and they exhibit relatively few environmental issues (in contrast to, e.g., nickel-cadmium batteries) 36. Applications that can be fulfilled by storage technologies in the electricity system are numerous and range from high power to high energy applications [16]. However, electricity storage applications are not consistently defined in the literature. Thus, both the terminology and the number of applications strongly vary across publications. As an example, a commonly used approach classifies eleven distinct applications by the size of the specific application (power rating) and the discharge duration (Figure 1) [10]. Due to the fast response time, as well as their ability to scale energy and power rating, the four battery technologies in focus of this paper are capable of serving almost all storage applications shown in Figure 1. Consideration must be given that, although technically feasible, the economic viability of using batteries in some applications (e.g., long-term storage of large amounts of energy) is to be questioned. 34 The Zero Emission Battery Research Activity (ZEBRA) battery is a sodium-nickel chloride based high temperature battery. 35 While lithium-ion batteries are well established for portable devices, this technology is described as not mature for grid- scale electricity storage (Naish et al., 2007; EPRI, 2010). 36 Although lead can have adverse effects on the environment at high concentrations, the actual impact of lead acid batteries is typically limited due to high recovery and recycling rates (Karlsson, 1999). 64 FIGURE 1: OVERVIEW OF ELECTRICITY STORAGE APPLICATIONS [10] In this paper, a focus is placed upon the six electricity storage applications that are either already relevant for storage today (Utility Energy Time-shift and Energy Management (community scale)) or that will be of increasing importance with a rising share of renewable power generation (Transmission & Distribution (T&D) Investment Deferral, Increase of Self-consumption, Area and Frequency Regulation and Support of Voltage Regulation)37. Utility Energy Time-shift decouples a utility’s energy generation from the energy demand on a daily basis. For instance, energy produced during off-peak hours (e.g., by base load power plants or wind parks) is stored and later discharged when energy demand is high and prices peak. Energy Management (community scale) shifts energy consumption over time and thus lowers the electricity costs of a community by shaving consumption peaks, by exploiting price differences in electricity tariffs or by matching actual consumption with local electricity production. T&D Investment Deferral responds to the challenges of the transmission and distribution grid. Due to the growing energy demand, decoupled supply and demand regions, as well the fluctuating nature of most renewable energy generation, further investment in new lines, transformers and substations may become necessary. Storage can help to defer or to avoid investments in T&D infrastructure by storing energy until there is less stress on the grid infrastructure. Increase of Self-consumption is an end-consumer level application. “Prosumers” (those actors who both produce and consume energy) can significantly increase the share of the produced energy (e.g., by a roof-top photovoltaic system) which is self- consumed by including storage. Higher self-consumption has two main advantages. First, it reduces 37 As the names of the applications are based on an exhaustive literature review, they do not have necessarily the same wording as in Figure 1. a Independent System Operator b Distributed Energy Storage System c kVAR = kilo volt-ampere reactive Time End User Distribution Transmission Utility System ISOa Benefit Type Energy ($/kWh) Power ($/kW) Reliability ($/kW) Operations ($/kVAR & $/kW)cHigher Value for Energy Storage ($/kWh)Higher Value for Discharge Capacity($/kW)HoursMinutesSeconds 10s kW 100s kW 10s MW 100s MW DESSb Power Quality Reliability Energy Management Energy Arbitrage System Capacity Ancillary Services Renewable Smoothing T&D System Support T&D Investment Deferral Renewable Integration Size of Application 65 the amount of energy that needs to be purchased from the energy utility, and second, it reduces the burden on the distribution grid. The primary task of Area and Frequency Regulation is to maintain the grid frequency at a pre-defined level by balancing short-duration differences between supply and demand. This service, also called “primary control reserve” in the European grid system, responds to an automatic control signal by the grid operator [17]. Support of Voltage Regulation is defined as the injection or absorption of power to support the control of reactance in the transmission and distribution grid [18] 38. In contrast to Area and Frequency Regulation that affects the whole grid, this ancillary service is often applied on a local level at the distribution grid. Generally, in the storage debate, technologies and applications are classified in power (up to 30 minutes of discharge duration) and energy (above 30 minutes) [19]. Using this nomenclature, the six applications analyzed can be grouped into four energy and two power applications (Area and Frequency Regulation and Support of Voltage Regulation). 2.2 Lifecycle costs analyses of battery technologies While publications and reports on storage technologies and applications are widely available, techno- economic performance has not been the focus of many publications. Often the analysis focuses on investment costs ignoring the differences in performance across applications. However, a fair comparison of technologies must rest on a lifecycle costs assessment by incorporating differences in technology lifetime, operating costs and efficiency in the calculation. In an extensive literature review, eight studies were identified that investigate lifecycle costs of storage technologies across different applications. Table 1 lists these studies and describes the covered technologies and applications, as well as the particular input and output parameters. Additionally, it is indicated whether the particular publication provides a sensitivity analysis or investigates the impact of uncertainty in input parameters. 38 Costs for additional components that are necessary for voltage regulation (e.g., Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems) are not included in the analysis. 66 TABLE 1: PUBLICATIONS ON LIFECYCLE COSTS ANALYSIS OF BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES Source Author, Year Technologies Applications Input parameters Output parametera Sensitivity / Uncertainty analysis [20] Hittinger, Whitacre, Apt, 2012 Lithium-ion, sodium-sulfur Frequency regulation, wind smoothing (baseload power), wind smoothing (load following), peak shaving Based on EPRI- DOE [21] and manufacturer data Annualized cost of energy storage [USD] Yes / No [10] EPRI, 2010 Iron-chromium, lead- acid, lithium-ion, sodium-sulfur, vanadium redox flow, zinc-air T&Db grid support, renewable integration / time shifting Estimates based on technology monitoring efforts at EPRI Levelized cost of electricity [USD/kWh] and levelized costs of energy capacity [USD/kW] No / No [22] Kintner- Meyer et. al., 2010 Lithium-ion, sodium-sulfur Balancing / ancillary services Based on literature review (1996-2010) Annualized cost of energy storage [USD] Yes / No [13] Bünger et. al., 2009 NaNiCl c, nickel- cadmium, lead-acid, lithium-ion, sodium- sulfur, vanadium redox battery, zinc- bromine Seasonal storage, load leveling, peak shaving Data derived from literature, reports / studies and expert interviews Levelized cost of electricity [EUR/kWh] Yes / No [23] Steward et. al., 2009 Nickel-cadmium, sodium-sulfur, vanadium redox flow Energy arbitrage Input data based on EPRI-DOE [21], Schoenung and Hassenzahl [24], Schoenung and Eyer [25] Levelized cost of electricity [USD/kWh] Yes / No e [11] Poonpun, Jewell, 2008 Lead-acid, sodium- sulfur, vanadium redox flow, VRLA d, zinc-bromine Generation, transmission and distribution level applications Input data based on Schoenung and Hassenzahl [24] and manufacturer data Levelized cost of electricity [USD/kWh] No / No [25] Schoenung, Eyer, 2008 Lead-acid (flooded / VRLA d), lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, sodium-sulfur, vanadium redox flow, zinc-bromine 4 value propositions, mostly combined applications, e.g., T&Db deferral plus energy price arbitrage Cost and performance data based on Schoenung and Hassenzahl [24] Levelized costs of energy capacity [USD/kW] No / No [24] Schoenung, Hassenzahl, 2003 Lead-acid (flooded / VRLA d), lithium-ion, polysulfide bromide, sodium-sulfur, vanadium redox flow, zinc-bromine Bulk energy storage (load-leveling / load management), distributed generation (peak shaving), power quality / end-use reliability Most data values derived from discussions with vendors / published literature Levelized cost of electricity [USD/kWh] and levelized costs of energy capacity [USD/kW] No / No a Original wording in publications might differ b Transmission & Distribution c NaNiCl: Sodium-nickel chloride (“ZEBRA-battery”) d Valve-regulated lead-acid e Steward et al. supplemented their analysis of storage lifecycle costs in an energy arbitrage applications with “high costs”, representing “first-generation installations and conservative estimates”, and “low costs”, representing “optimal of ‘fully mature’ technologies and many large-scale installations”, estimates ([23], page 4) Comparing the absolute values of lifecycle costs across publications is difficult because the definitions of applications vary across publications and because lifecycle costs depend strongly on the specific application. In the few cases in which applications are similarly defined, the resulting lifecycle costs still vary considerably 39. 39 For instance, while Schoenung and Hassenzahl (Schoenung and Hassenzahl, 2003) calculated lifecycle costs of lead-acid in an application with a discharge duration of six hours and 250 deep cycles per year of 0.38 USD/kWh, Poonpun and Jewell (Poonpun and Jewell, 2008) estimate lifecycle costs of 0.29 USD/kWh for lead-acid in the same application. 67 Contrarily, publications that investigate the sensitivity of lifecycle costs in relation to the changes in the input parameters mostly report consistent results in terms of these sensitivities [13,20,22,23]. Energy-related capital costs is the parameter with the highest influence on lifecycle costs, regardless of the investigated technology. In addition, operation & maintenance (O&M) costs are regularly of minor influence upon the total costs. However, some inconsistency among these publications exists in other aspects, e.g., with regards to the impact of roundtrip efficiency or electricity prices. While these studies on storage lifecycle costs strongly improved the understanding of battery performance across applications, three potential extensions can be identified. The first and most important extension refers to the treatment of uncertainty in input parameters. The comprehensive review of battery costs and performance parameters [13,15,19,21,24–32] revealed a strong variation for almost all input values (compare Section 3.2.1). Fundamental parameters like roundtrip efficiency or calendrical life vary even for mature technologies like lead-acid or sodium-sulfur. Hence, it is pivotal to systematically account for this uncertainty in input parameters when modeling lifecycle costs in order to understand the relative competitiveness of the alternative technologies. Second, some contributions include only a very limited set of applications, often biased towards large-scale energy applications, thus disregarding power and end-consumer applications. Third, the existing literature offers room to increase the methodological rigor. With some notable exceptions [13,22,33], most publications neglect aspects such as system size optimization depending on efficiency and cycle life, and varying discount rates across applications. 3. Methodology and Data The following section introduces the methodology and data used in the lifecycle costs modeling. It starts with a description of the literature review and expert interviews, followed by a presentation of battery and application input data. Finally, a description of the techno-economic model is given with its three modules. Figure 2 gives an overview of both the methodology applied and the input data used for the assessment of battery lifecycle costs. 68 FIGURE 2: OVERVIEW OF METHODOLOGY AND INPUT DATA FOR LIFECYCLE COSTS MODELING (INCLUDING CHAPTER NUMBERS) 3.1 Literature review and expert interviews The input data for the techno-economic modeling of lifecycle costs was derived in two steps. First, a comprehensive literature review was conducted covering both publications in peer-reviewed journals and reports by leading research and industry institutions. Second, the resulting data was triangulated and validated through expert interviews. In total, ten experts were interviewed between February and April of 2012. Interviewees included professors from technical universities, heads of departments of research institutes, and practitioners from energy storage companies. Each interview lasted between 30 and 60 minutes and was conducted either in person or via phone. Besides battery and application input data, the calculation method and the results were discussed in these interviews as well. Table 2 gives an overview of the interview participants. 3.3 TECHNO-ECONOMIC MODELING 3.3.1 System sizing and depth-of-discharge optimization module 3.3.2 Levelized costs of electricity (LCOESA) calculation module 3.3.3 Monte Carlo simulation module 3.2.1 Battery data 3.2.2 Application data ▪ Stochastic input parameters – Energy capacity costs – Roundtrip efficiency – Calendrical life – Cycle lifea ▪ Deterministic input parameters – Power conversion system costs – Balance-of-plant costs – Operations & maintenance costs ▪ Required power rating ▪ Required energy rating ▪ Cycle frequency ▪ Discharge duration ▪ Discount rate ▪ Electricity price 3.1 LITERATURE REVIEW AND EXPERT INTERVIEWS DISTRIBUTION OF LIFECYCLE COSTS (LCOESA) 3.2 INPUT DATA a Cycle life as function of average depth-of-discharge 69 TABLE 2: OVERVIEW OF PARTICIPANTS IN EXPERT INTERVIEWS # Employer Research focus / role 1 University Energy storage 2 University Solid state chemistry 3 Research institute Decentralized energy systems 4 Research institute Energy autarky 5 Research institute Electrochemical energy storage 6 Research institute Electrochemistry 7 Battery manufacturer Head of sales 8 Battery project developer Project manager 9 System integrator Head of battery research 10 Energy utility Head of corporate development 3.2 Input data 3.2.1 Battery data The modeling of lifecycle costs required a set of seven battery input parameters: Energy capacity costs, power conversion system costs, balance-of-plant costs, operation & maintenance costs, roundtrip efficiency, calendrical life and cycle life40. Of the aforementioned, the energy capacity costs, roundtrip efficiency, calendrical life and cycle life have the highest impact on lifecycle costs and thus were included in the Monte Carlo simulation as stochastic input parameters [34]. By depicting the variation in the literature for these four parameters across technologies, Figure 3 highlights the uncertainty present in these parameters. The numerical values in Figure 3 indicate the input values for the Monte Carlo simulation. In general, the required stochastic input parameters for the PERT distributions in the Monte Carlo simulation (low, mode (most likely), high) were based on the “minimum”, “mean” and “maximum” values of the literature review (compare Section 3.3.3). Furthermore, these inputs were discussed in the expert interviews, which can be summarized as follows. Literature values of battery parameters have been validated for the lithium-ion and sodium-sulfur technologies without any reservations, while values for lead-acid and vanadium redox flow were questioned in the interviews. The energy capacity costs for lead-acid, retrieved from literature, were considered too high by most experts. As a consequence, the mode in the Monte Carlo simulation for lead-acid is based on the “average lower bound” instead of the mean from the literature review41. The costs of vanadium redox 40 When comparing battery systems of different sizes in the various applications lower costs for larger systems might be assumed due to project level economies of scale. However, small applications often have large market potentials, resulting in market level economies of scale. Therefore, battery cost input data was assumed to be equal across applications. 41 The “average lower (upper) bound” constitutes the mean of the lower (upper) bounds of the ranges for battery parameters retrieved in the literature review. 70 flow were described as too optimistic. Since marketability of vanadium redox flow batteries has only recently begun with first commercial products from a few manufacturers, the data accuracy, especially with regards to costs, was questioned several times by the experts interviewed. Therefore, a more conservative approach was chosen for that technology, implementing the “average upper bound” of the literature review for the mode of the energy capacity costs in the Monte Carlo simulation.

Discount rate and electricity prices are further application-specific parameters. With the exception of Area and Frequency Regulation, the application-specific input parameters were derived from the literature and validated in the expert interviews. The input values for these five parameters are shown in Table 4. Generally, it is presumed that during one cycle the amount of energy [MWh], which is specified by the individual application requirements, is withdrawn from the battery system. The only exception to this rule is Area and Frequency Regulation where the average cycle corresponds to 38 seconds while the sizing of the battery system has to allow for a discharge duration of up to 15 minutes42. A standard discount rate of 8% is applied across applications. The impact of lower discount rates is exemplified for communities and grid operators (6%) as well as for households (4%) [37]. The assumed electricity prices range between the retail prices for private end-consumers and wholesale prices for industrial companies, grid operators and utilities. 42 For Area and Frequency Regulation, additionally to the literature review, a set of grid frequency data has been analyzed (the data is based on one week frequency data with a resolution of 5 seconds, retrieved from the Swiss electricity grid between 06/18/2011 and 06/24/2011). Since devices serving primary control reserve have to be available for a maximum of 15 minutes (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E)) the discharge duration for Area and Frequency Regulation is set to a quarter of an hour. The analysis of the frequency data reveals an average of 34 occurrences per day, defined as the situation where grid frequency leaves the standardized frequency band of 49.95 Hz to 50.05 Hz. The mean duration of an occurrence was 38 seconds, amounting to 4.2% of the required maximum availability of 15 minutes. Thus, the depth-of-discharge was set to 5% for this application. The approximated cycle life at 5% DOD for the four technologies is as follows: Lead-acid: 6,378, Lithium-ion: 53,733, Sodium-sulfur: 24,505 and Vanadium redox flow: 22,730. These values were confirmed as realistic during the expert interviews. 72 While theoretically batteries can be scaled to serve grid-scale applications due to their modular design, currently planned and installed battery projects are at maximum within the dimensions of 20-40 MW for lead-acid, lithium-ion and flow batteries and up to 80 MW for sodium-sulfur batteries43. Thus, the Utility-Energy Time Shift application with a power rating of 100 MW is at the upper limit of current realistic battery installations.

The first module calculates the battery system size with respect to roundtrip efficiency and depth-of-discharge optimization (Section 3.3.1). The depth-of-discharge can be defined as the energy withdrawn from a battery, expressed as a percentage of the full energy capacity. Second, given the optimal system size, battery and application input data are used to calculate lifecycle costs of these technologies in terms of levelized costs of electricity for storage applications (LCOESA) (Section 3.3.2). Third, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted with the main battery input parameters resulting in a distribution of lifecycle costs for each combination of the four technologies with each of the six applications (Section 3.3.3). 43 An 80 MW sodium-sulfur installation was planned, although temporally halted, by Tohoku Electric Power Co. Inc. and NGK Insulators Ltd (Nikkei, 2011). 73 3.3.1 System sizing and depth-of-discharge (DOD) optimization module The model’s first module adapts the battery system size depending on technical characteristics and application parameters. Two aspects are included in the calculation. First, each application requires a specific amount of energy (in Wh) to be delivered by the battery system. In order to meet the required energy capacity of the application, the sizing of the system has to account for efficiency losses during storage and discharging. Second, as the cycle life of batteries can be strongly reduced by very deep cycles, the standard maximum DOD of the battery systems is set to 80%, thus increasing the required energy capacity to be installed. An additional DOD optimization is implemented for lead-acid and sodium-sulfur batteries because only for these mature technologies reliable data on the relation of DOD and cycle life exists. The optimal sizing of the battery system depends on the cycle frequency of the application, i.e., on how often the application is used. As the cycle life of a battery can be increased with lower average DOD [43], the DOD is “one of the most interesting parameters to play with” ([44], page 32). However, because the required energy capacity is set by the specific application, a lower DOD implies a larger battery system. Taken together, this means that the lower the DOD, the higher the upfront capital investment, yet the longer the replacement intervals. Consequently, this module detects the specific optimum of system size and DOD for each combination of technology and application. 3.3.2 Levelized costs of electricity (LCOESA) calculation module In order to assess lifecycle costs of batteries, the second module of the model employs the concept of levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) to compare the lifecycle costs of technologies in the different applications. In general, the LCOE concept determines the total costs that occur during the lifetime of a technology divided by the lifetime energy production and thus accounts for the differences in lifetimes across technologies [45]. This methodology is often used in literature as a benchmarking or ranking tool to calculate the cost-effectiveness of different energy generation technologies and is based on the following formula [46,47]: ∑ ∑ (1) The approach of the “Levelized Cost of Electricity for Storage Applications” (LCOESA) adapts the LCOE concept to storage technologies. The LCOESA are defined as the total annualized costs of the CAPEX: Investment costs [EUR] i: Discount rate [%] OPEX: Operation & maintenance costs [EUR] N: Plant lifetime [years] kWhinitial,net: Initial net electricity production [kWh] 74 energy storage system divided by the annual energy output [23]. Importantly, the LCOESA for one technology may vary strongly depending on the application. For instance, because the annual energy output enters the LCOESA formula in the denominator, an application with a high energy throughput (e.g., Utility Energy Time-shift) is likely to have lower LCOESA than an application with very little energy throughput (e.g., Area and Frequency Regulation). Taken together, the LCOESA concept provides a useful metric to compare the costs of technologies across applications on a fair basis [10]. 3.3.3 Monte Carlo simulation module As a purely deterministic LCOESA calculation would neglect the strong variance in input parameters (compare Section 3.2.1), the third module applies a Monte Carlo simulation in order to assess this impact of uncertainty. In general, the Monte Carlo method is a “statistical numerical method used for solving mathematical problems” ([48], page 648) by repeatedly drawing input values for a deterministic calculation from distributions of stochastic input parameters. The calculation is conducted with each set of input parameters and the resulting output values are observed [45]. Based on the law of large numbers, the distribution of the observed output values in the Monte Carlo simulation converges to their theoretical distribution. This represents a practical approach to investigate the effect of uncertainty in case an analytic solution of the calculation is not possible or too complex. A Monte Carlo simulation requires a distribution and the corresponding distributional parameters for each stochastic input value. A PERT distribution was assumed for the stochastic input parameters because this distribution is explicitly recommended to be used to model expert estimates as it is less sensitive to extreme values, for instance in comparison to the triangular distribution [49,50]. The PERT distribution is based on the beta distribution and was developed for the “Program Evaluation and Review Technique” analysis. In general, the “minimum”, “mean” and “maximum” values from the literature review were assigned to the three input values (low, mode (most likely), high) of the PERT distribution [51]. In case this assignment was questioned within the expert interviews, the mode of the PERT distribution was based on the “average lower bound” or “average upper bound” from the literature review (compare Section 3.2.1). For the four technologies and six applications in focus, the Monte Carlo simulations were conducted with 10,000 runs with the four stochastic input parameters: Energy capacity costs, roundtrip efficiency, calendrical life and cycle life44. Additional Monte Carlo simulations were conducted in order to assess the impact of depth-of-discharge optimization and varying discount rates. Therefore, with a total of 540,000 simulated data points, the model is able to estimate the LCOESA distributions for all 44 The four stochastic input parameters were assumed to be mutually uncorrelated. 75 technologies across applications including sensitivities to discount rate reduction and depth-of- discharge optimization. 4. Results The results generated by the probabilistic lifecycle costs model are summarized in Figure 4, in which the mean levelized costs of electricity (LCOESA), the impact of uncertainty in input parameters, the sensitivities to discount rate reduction and to depth-of-discharge optimization are shown. The numerical values on the left and the length of the bars both represent the mean LCOESA. The impact of uncertainty in input parameters is shown by the 95% error bars, indicating the range in which 95% of the LCOESA values generated by the Monte Carlo simulation lie. Sensitivities to lower discount rates (for end-consumer and community/grid operator applications) and depth-of-discharge optimization (for lead-acid and sodium sulfur) are shown by the shaded areas within the colored bars and by the green triangles respectively 45. Comparing the LCOESA estimates in Figure 4 with the ones from preceding studies on battery lifecycle costs requires similarly defined applications. The Utility Energy Time-shift application is roughly comparable with Energy Arbitrage in Steward et al. (2009) [23], with the Generation (8h discharge duration) application in Poonpun and Jewell (2008) [11] and also with Bulk Energy Storage in Schoenung and Hassenzahl (2003) [24]. These publications are in line with our finding that sodium- sulfur has the lowest mean LCOESA in this application, followed by lead-acid and vanadium redox flow in close competition. Yet deviation occurs concerning the absolute level of LCOESA. While our analysis confirms the LCOESA value for sodium-sulfur (0.18 EUR/kWh) of Steward et al., it is higher than the estimate of Poonpun and Jewell (0.14 EUR/kWh). The result of Schoenung and Hassenzahl for sodium-sulfur in Bulk Energy Storage is 0.37 EUR/kWh, which is considerably higher than all other publications. However, given the earlier publication date, this might be due to technological advances within the recent years46. Two steps are taken to further discuss and analyze the results. First, the absolute values and the variation of mean LCOESA across applications and technologies are discussed. Second, attention is focused on the impact of uncertainty in input parameters by reviewing the distribution of LCOESA in terms of 95% error bars. 45 No sensitivity to DOD optimization is shown in Figure 4 in case the optimal DOD corresponds to the standard DOD at 80%. 46 All cost estimates were converted to EUR and adjusted for inflation based on the year of publication. 76 FIGURE 4: LIFECYCLE COSTS (LCOESA) BY APPLICATION AND TECHNOLOGY 4.1 Discussion of mean LCOESA results First, stationary battery technologies are still expensive. Contrasted with the average European electricity wholesale price (0.044 EUR/kWh) [52] and retail price (0.172 EUR/kWh) [53], battery energy storage would add considerable additional costs on the wholesale and retail level47. For instance, 47 Wholesale electricity prices correspond to the average EEX spot price 2010. Retail electricity prices correspond to the unweighted average of EU-27 retail (end-user) electricity prices of May 2012.

Second, mean lifecycle costs of stationary battery technologies vary strongly across technologies and applications. On the one hand, given a certain application, the mean LCOESA vary strongly across technologies. For instance, for Area and Frequency Regulation, the mean LCOESA for lead-acid (2.10 EUR/kWh) are almost three times as high as that the mean LCOESA for lithium-ion (0.80 EUR/kWh). The main drivers behind this variation are the differences in investment costs and cycle life across technologies. On the other hand, given a certain technology, the mean LCOESA differ to a considerable extent across applications. As a rule, the LCOESA decrease with a higher utilization of the battery. Therefore, the higher the average energy throughput the lower the LCOESA. As a result, the mean LCOESA for energy applications are lower than for power applications. Third, the ranking of battery technologies differs across applications. As indicated in Figure 4, sodium-sulfur has the lowest mean LCOESA in Utility Energy Time-shift, T&D Investment Deferral and Energy Management (community scale), while lithium-ion leads in the power applications Area and Frequency Regulation and Support of Voltage Regulation and lead-acid is the most cost efficient in the end-consumer application Increase of Self-consumption. In general, the ranking of technologies is determined by the relative investment costs and replacement intervals, which mainly depend, in turn, on the application parameters discharge duration and cycle frequency. Hence, given low investment costs along with a short cycle life, lead-acid has a comparative advantage for small scale, yet rarely used applications. With an increasing scale and use of applications, the advantage shifts to sodium- sulfur, and with ever increasing cycle frequency, this would further shift to vanadium redox flow. Lithium-ion leads for all applications with a high power-to-energy ratio and high cycle frequency. Cost for recycling and disposal were not included in the lifecycle costs calculations. Quantitative estimates on their impact on the lifecycle costs of the four technologies are rare. Yet it seems likely that the incorporation of recycling and disposal costs would slightly benefit lithium-ion and lead-acid. For these two technologies, several studies estimate that owners might generate a small revenue from selling batteries at the end-of-life due to the value of the material included in the old battery, especially for large-scale installations [21,54–56]. In case of vanadium redox flow, a high stability of the vanadium electrolyte and a simple recycling process is likely to result in small disposal costs [15,21,57]. Sodium-sulfur batteries are describes as almost entirely recyclable (98-100%) yielding high-purity raw materials, yet no estimates on costs are available [21,58,59]. Fourth, battery lifecycle costs can be decreased by system size optimization (depth-of-discharge optimization) and by lower discount rates. First, as described in Section 3.3.1, each battery technology has a specific functional relation between the average depth-of-discharge and the cycle life. 78 Optimizing the system size of a battery system can exploit this relationship and reduce the resulting LCOESA. For instance, in the Energy Management (community scale) application the system size optimization for the sodium-sulfur technology results in an optimal depth-of-discharge of 55%, lowering the mean LCOESA by around 9%. Second, the lifecycle costs are sensitive to the discount rate. For example, in the end-consumer application Increase of Self-consumption, a four percentage point lower discount rate that can be assumed for households lowers the mean LCOESA of lithium-ion by more than 16%. 4.2 Discussion of the impact of uncertainty in input parameters First, the impact of uncertainty in battery input parameters is very high, with the 95% error bars ranging on average from 65% to 153% of mean LCOESA. Calculating the variation coefficient, a measure that normalizes the variation by dividing the standard deviation by the mean, results in an average value of 23%. Thus, the strong variation in the literature on battery input parameters translates into very large uncertainty ranges in the lifecycle costs of battery systems across applications. Moreover, all LCOESA distributions are positively skewed, i.e., the density of the LCOESA distributions is higher on the left side, while the right tail is longer. Thus, LCOESA outliers tend to be on the high cost side. Second, incorporating uncertainty in input parameters reveals that in none of the analyzed applications a clearly leading technology exists. The absolute difference in mean LCOESA across technologies is often negligible compared to the error bars indicating the 95% confidence interval of the mean LCOESA. For instance, the error bar for lithium-ion in Energy Management (community scale) ranges from 49% (2.5 percentile at 0.13 EUR/kWh) to 194% (97.5 percentile at 0.52 EUR/kWh) of the mean LCOESA (0.27 EUR/kWh), while the difference in the mean LCOESA between lithium-ion and lead- acid is just 7%. As a result, in all six investigated applications, the error bar of the by mean LCOESA cheapest technology is overlapping with the error bars of all other three technologies. The likelihood that the by mean LCOESA cheapest technology is outperformed by one of the other three technologies is above 10% for all applications and reveals that for all applications a significantly leading technology does not exist. Hence, the impact of uncertainty in input parameters outweighs the differences in the mean lifecycle costs across technologies underlining the relevance of an uncertainty analysis. Third, lithium-ion exhibits the highest uncertainty in LCOESA, while sodium-sulfur LCOESA are the least uncertain. The Monte Carlo simulation shows that the impact of uncertainty is the highest for lithium-ion, followed by vanadium redox flow and lead-acid, while lifecycle costs of sodium-sulfur exhibit the least variation. The average LCOESA variation coefficient of lithium-ion is at 36%, yet only at 12% for sodium-sulfur. These results are consistent with the fact that stationary lithium-ion is an 79 immature technology with many different competing designs, while sodium-sulfur is an established technology produced only by a few firms worldwide. With many different producers (lead-acid) and with only a few sources reporting cost estimates (vanadium redox flow), the middle positions of the remaining two technologies are also in line with expectations. Fourth, lifecycle costs in the Support of Voltage Regulation application are the least affected by uncertainty in input parameters. The average variation coefficient across technologies is at 11% for Support of Voltage Regulation, whereas the other five applications have variation coefficients ranging from 23% (Increase of Self-consumption), over 25% (T&D Investment Deferral and Energy Management (community scale)) to 27% (Utility Energy Time-shift and Area and Frequency Regulation). The reason for the relatively lower uncertainty of lifecycle costs in Support of Voltage Regulation is that the LCOESA in this application are less sensitive to the four stochastic input parameters compared to the LCOESA in the remaining five applications. 5. Conclusion The present paper aims to serve as decision-making support for researchers, practitioners and policy makers by reviewing costs and performance of battery technologies while explicitly taking the uncertainty in input parameters into account. The main result of this paper is that the present uncertainty in input parameters for batteries exceeds by far the differences in lifecycle costs across technologies. For most electricity storage applications, the absolute differences in mean lifecycle costs across technologies are negligible compared to the uncertainty ranges of lifecycle costs. Although sodium-sulfur, lead-acid and lithium-ion each exhibit cost leadership by mean lifecycle costs for specific applications, the respective relative advantage is not significant. Therefore, a competition still exists between the four analyzed battery technologies and so far a leading technology has yet to emerge in any of the investigated applications. From our analysis, the following four points emerge as important topics for further research. First, the calculation method could be expanded to incorporate additional technical complexities. A non-linear cost structure including fixed costs and economies of scale, along with the impact of the ambient temperature on lifetime and performance, and degradation of roundtrip efficiency are just some examples. Second, in this paper a static review was conducted and focused on costs and performance factors. Potential extensions may include forecasts of future costs and performance developments or extend the assessment to additional factors, such as environmental impact or resource availability. Third, an analysis of the profitability of stationary battery systems based on the economic benefits of these applications and market potential should be conducted. Private investment in storage projects 80 and diffusion support by policy makers require a more complete picture of storage applications by bringing together both the costs and the benefits. Fourth, future research should investigate the impact of deployment policies on firm activity in the battery industry building upon lessons learned, for instance, within the electricity sector [60]. 81 6.

Schmidt Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich), Department of Management, Technology, and Economics, Chair of Sustainability and Technology, Weinbergstrasse 56/58, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland 88 Abstract Stationary electricity storage (SES) technologies are effective in addressing grid stability issues arising from high shares of intermittent renewable energy technologies. As these technologies currently exhibit high costs, policy makers have started introducing demand-pull policies in order to foster their diffusion and drive these technologies further down the learning curve. However, as observed in the case of renewable energy technologies (RETs), demand-pull policies for technologies can come at high costs in cases where the profitability gap that needs to be covered by the policy support is large. Yet in contrast to RETs, SES can create value in various ways and can be employed by very different customer/user groups making it a technology that can be used in multiple distinct applications in the power system – a “multi-purpose technology”. In this paper, we argue that policy makers can make use of the multi-purpose character of SES to limit costs of demand-pull policies. To this end, we propose a demand-pull policy strategy which grants support for the application with the smallest profitability gap first, before moving to the application with the second smallest profitability gap etc., thereby moving down the learning curve efficiently. We provide support for our argumentation in two steps. First, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of SES applications exemplifying the multi- purpose character of these technologies. Second, we assess the profitability of one SES technology (vanadium redox flow battery) in five SES applications highlighting a strong variation of the profitability gap across these applications. Finally, we discuss limitations and preconditions for the proposed policy strategy. Keywords: Vanadium redox flow battery, techno-economic LCOEC model, learning curve, innovation, profitability, subsidy 89 1. Introduction In recent years, many governments have introduced policies (e.g., feed-in tariffs) aiming to induce the diffusion of renewable energy technologies (RETs) (Bernstein et al., 2007; IEA, 2011a; REN21, 2012), also called “demand-pull policies” 48 (Jaffe et al., 2005; Taylor, 2008). On the one hand, these policies had positive effects such as improved technological performance, massive reductions of RET costs, and reduced carbon emissions of the electricity sector (IRENA, 2012a). On the other hand, such policies can results in high costs (del Río and Gual, 2007). Above that, the resulting diffusion of RETs challenges power quality and security (Georgilakis, 2008) as the power system has to cope with the intermittent and non-deterministic nature of most RETs (IEA, 2011a, 2011b). In fact, several studies argue that the intermittency of most new renewable energies is a major bottleneck for a transition of the energy system (IEA, 2011b; Kohler et al., 2010; Krajačić et al., 2011a). To address intermittency issues, several technical levers exist (IEA, 2011b). Out of these levers, stationary electricity storage (SES) is a promising response option to cope with the challenges induced by intermittent RETs (Culver and Miller, 2010; IRENA, 2012b), since the practical potential of electricity demand side management is limited (Hollinger et al., 2013) and grid extensions are often impeded or delayed by public opposition (The Economist, 2012) . However, given the high costs of most SES technologies and the resulting lack of profitable business options for private investors and companies, their diffusion rate is still very low (VDE, 2012; Walawalkar and Apt, 2008). Thus, in order to drive down SES costs further technological innovation and learning is needed (VDE, 2012). Especially in the case of clean energy technologies such as SES49, demand-pull policies are widely seen as an effective tool to induce innovation and consequently cost reductions (Hoppmann et al., 2013; Sagar and van der Zwaan, 2006; Taylor and Fujita, 2013)50. Economic theory suggests that in the presence of “learning-by-doing”, diffusion of an technology triggers innovation resulting in cost reductions due to learning spillovers from production and use phases (Arrow, 1962). However, as firms investing in production of clean energy technologies are not able to appropriate the spillover effect completely, there is a strong rationale for policy intervention to correct for this market failure (Gillingham and Sweeney, 2010; van Benthem et al., 2007). From an empirical point of view, the relationship between diffusion and innovation in form of cost reductions can also be described quantitatively by learning or experience curves – a concept that is widely used in studies on the energy 48 The core of the demand-pull argument is that firms direct their research and production efforts in response to changes in market conditions trying to satisfy unmet demand and thus driving technological change (Dosi, 1982; Nemet, 2009). 49 SES can be regarded as clean energy technology as most SES applications in the power system support directly or indirectly the integration of RETs (cf. Section 2.2). 50 A valid alternative for policy makers to foster technological learning are so-called technology-push instruments which emphasize the role of research and science in technological innovation (Chidamber and Kon, 1994). However, the focus of this paper lies on demand-pull instruments. 90 sector (Argote and Epple, 1990; Jamasb, 2007; Rubin et al., 2004; Taylor and Fujita, 2013)51. Recent studies comparing learning curves across technologies have found evidence for steep learning curves for clean energy technologies indicating high endogenous learning potential (Junginger et al., 2010; McDonald and Schrattenholzer, 2001). Learning curves have also been applied to SES. For instance, Kromer and Heywood (2007) use this concept to compare cost reduction potentials of different battery types showing that deployment leads to strong cost reductions in SES. Summing up, demand-pull policies for SES are seen as appropriate instruments to reduce costs by driving these technologies down the learning curve (Gross et al., 2012; IRENA, 2012b; Krajačić et al., 2011b; Sagar and van der Zwaan, 2006). In fact, policy makers in several countries have started implementing support schemes for SES (Clean Energy States Alliance, 2012; KfW, 2013). However, demand-pull policies can come at high costs in cases where the profitability gap that needs to be covered by the policy is large (del Río and Gual, 2007; Frondel et al., 2010). For instance, demand-pull policies for renewable energy technologies often result in high costs due to the typically higher life-cycle costs of renewable energy technologies compared to their conventional alternatives (IRENA, 2012a; Peters et al., 2011; Schmidt et al., 2012). This may lead to higher public spending or increases of end-consumers electricity bills as seen, for instance, in Germany (Frondel et al., 2010). As the burden on public or private budgets need to be considered (del Río, 2012), the question arises, how can policy makers support the diffusion of SES while at the same time limiting the costs of these policies? In this paper we argue that in order to limit costs, policy makers need to be more strategic and support technologies where their support comes at lower costs (Krajačić et al., 2011b). In the case of SES, policy makers can make use of a distinct feature of these technologies: their multi-purpose character. In contrast to RETs, which primarily create value through generating electricity, SES can create economic value in very different ways (e.g., improvement of power quality or power price arbitrage) making it a technology that can be used in multiple applications in the power system. As the profitability gap and hence the need for support can differ strongly across these applications, we propose that policy makers can implement a demand-pull strategy for multi-purpose technologies (MPTs) as SES that allows moving down the learning curve at the lowest costs. Policy makers can implement cost-efficient demand-pull policies by selecting first the MPT application with the smallest profitability gap, and thereby improving the profitability also in the MPT application that is likely to become highly relevant yet currently exhibits a larger profitability gap. 51 Thus, besides some caveats (Yeh and Rubin, 2012; Taylor and Fujita, 2013; Winskel et al., 2013), learning curves have been included in modeling of energy systems (Löschel, 2002; Qiu and Anadon, 2012) as well as applied to policy implications (Rivers and Jaccard, 2006; Kverndokk and Rosendahl, 2007). 91 The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In the theory section, the concept of multi- purpose technologies (MPTs) is defined (2.1) and the idea of a cost-efficient demand-pull strategy for multi-purpose technologies is developed (2.2). In the two subsequent chapters, the theoretical ideas are corroborated by applying them to the case of SES: While Section 3 demonstrates the multi-purpose character of SES based on a comprehensive literature review of SES applications, Section 4 addresses the profitability gap between distinct applications. To this end, we develop a probabilistic bottom-up life-cycle cost model for a specific SES technology (vanadium redox flow battery) using data for Germany (Section 4.1). The results of this modeling exercise show that the profitability gaps of this technology vary strongly across SES applications resulting in different support needs (Section 4.2). In section 5 we synthesize the analyses discussing the assumptions and limitations, while we conclude in section 6 by summarizing the main contributions and by indicating avenues for further research. 2. Theory – Demand-pull policies for multi-purpose technologies This section develops the main argument of this paper. We argue that policy makers can implement a strategic order of demand-pull policies in order to reduce the total costs of these policies in case a technology has multiple distinct applications. To this end, we first introduce the concept of multi- purpose technologies (Section 2.1), before the implications of this concept for demand-pull policies are derived (Section 2.2). 2.1 The concept of multi-purpose technologies In economic literature, technologies have been distinguished by their variety of use cases. While on one side of the spectrum some technologies have primarily a single purpose (e.g., the coffee machine), other technologies boast a virtually unlimited number of applications throughout the economy making them so-called “general-purpose technologies” (e.g., personal computers or microprocessors) (Lipsey et al., 1998). Building upon the notion of general-purpose technologies, the remainder of this subsection defines, describes and exemplifies the concept of multi-purpose technologies. The roots of the general-purpose technology concept can be traced back to the early work of Griliches (1957), Williamson (1983) and David (1990). Yet, Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995, p. 84) were among the first to explicitly identify general-purpose technologies (GPT) as “characterized by the potential for pervasive use in a wide range of sectors and by their technological dynamism”. Moreover, GPTs are described as spawning innovation and growth due to their complementary and enabling character in combination with other technologies (Jovanovic and Rousseau, 2005). Lipsey et al. (1998, p. 43) describe a GPT “as a technology that initially has much scope for improvement and eventually 92 comes to be widely used, to have many uses, and to have many spillover effects”52. Common examples of GPTs are computers or microprocessors (Lipsey et al., 1998). However, several technologies exist (e.g., X-ray, lasers, anaerobic digestion) that have multiple distinct applications, yet lack other key characteristics of GPTs (Lipsey et al., 1998) placing them between single- and general-purpose technologies. Although recent studies referred to such technologies as “multi-purpose technologies” (Dolata, 2009; Holm-Nielsen et al., 2009; Kleine, 2010), they have not been investigated from a theoretical point of view. Also a commonly used definition is missing in the literature. To address this gap, the following definition – based on yet extending the definition of Wicklein (1998) – is proposed in this paper: A multi-purpose technology (MPT) is a technology that has several distinct, economically relevant applications primarily focused on one or a few sectors, yet lacks the technological complementarities of general-purpose technologies. An “application”, as the key identifying aspect of MPTs, is characterized by a specific source of economic value addressing a specific customer / user group. These two dimensions build upon the description of Lipsey et. al (1998) that GPTs have a variety of purposes in a wide range of use cases and are explained in the following: a) The source of economic value dimensions describes through what mechanism the respective application generates economic value. This dimension is the starting point for the understanding of any economic aspect of the application as calculations of economic and systemic value as well as estimations of the market size are based on this dimension. b) The customer / user group dimension describes where a market would emerge and who the primary actors of this market would be. Similar to a company that needs to understand its customers in order to be successful, policy makers need to know targets and actors of the demand- pull policy as the design and mechanisms of policy instrument varies across them. For instance, supporting applications for large companies will require differently designed instruments than supporting applications for private end-consumers. Therefore, this dimension identifies the actors that are primarily involved in this application. Thus, a multi-purpose technology is a technology that has different sources of value creation and is used by different customers groups. Thereby, it can be employed in several applications each of them 52 Due to these characteristics the concept of GPTs had the most impact on academic literature on economic growth. Several studies, including yet not limited to Carlaw and Lipsey (2006), David and Wright (1999) as well as Majumdar et al. (2009), focus on the impact of GPTs on productivity and economic growth. Other contributions investigate the relation of GPTs and wage inequality (Aghion et al., 2002) or the influence of GPTs on aspects as interest rates, stock market performance or industry structure (Jovanovic and Rousseau, 2005). 93 being characterized by different value drivers, different competing technologies and different customers. Two aspects deliniate multi-purpose technologies from GPTs. First, while GPTs have the potential to be used in almost unlimited number of applications across sectors (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995), the number of applications of multi-purpose technologies is limited and typically focused on one or a few sectors. Second, as aforementioned, due to technological complementarities GPTs are likely to have a positive effect on overall economic growth, whereas multi-purpose technologies lack this characteristic. Therefore, technologies such as X-ray or laser cannot be regarded as GPTs as they lack the technical complimentarities and pervavise use throughout the economy (Lipsey et al., 1998). However, given their multiple distinct application they qualify as multi-purpose technologies. For instance, X-ray applications range from data retrieval (e.g., radiography) to cancer treatment in the health sector, yet are also used by archeologists and in the security industry. These examples of a limited number of use cases across actor groups illustrate the definition of applications and multi- purpose technologies: Both the source of economic value and the customer / user group vary across the applications of X-rays. However, the classification of single, multi or general-purpose technologies should rather be understood as continuum. Some technologies might be at the borderline between two groups. Moreover, the classification is also time dependent. As further applications of a technology may evolve over time, a specific technology can move from single to multi or even from multi to general- purpose technologies (Lipsey et al., 1998). 2.2 A cost-efficient demand-pull strategy for MPTs based on learning curves In this subsection we argue that the fact that a technology is a MTP can be relevant to policy makers. Before introducing a demand-pull policy for a certain MPT, policy makers should be aware of the potentially differing costs that incur when different applications are supported. Theoretically, policy makers can use the fact that a MPT has several distinct applications in order to implement a cost- efficient order of demand-pull policies. Section 2.1 defined MPT as technologies that can serve several distinct applications, yet lack the technological complementarities of GPTs. From an economic perspective, these applications can be regarded as different markets as each application has different value drivers, different competing technologies, and different customers. Hence, in case of MPTs, policy makers have the option to choose in which application to support deployment, and where to create a market for the technology. The existence of multiple distinct applications of a technology becomes especially relevant for policy makers in case the economics of the technology varies across applications. As demand-pull policies 94 typically work by creating markets through bridging the profitability gap (e.g., through subsidies) or through forcing the uptake of technologies (e.g., through command-and-control policies) (Menanteau et al., 2003; Palmer and Burtraw, 2005), differences in the profitability of technologies across applications translate into varying costs of demand-pull policies across applications. For instance, while in one application the business case might be close to profitability and the large scale diffusion hindered only by other (e.g., regulatory) barriers, another application might be very far away from any positive return for investors resulting in a high support need in for this application. Consequently, in this paper we argue that in case the profitability of multi-purpose technologies varies across applications policy makers can be strategic in order to limit costs of demand-pull policies. By sequentially supporting applications based on their profitability gap, policy makers can implement demand-pull policies while limiting total costs of these policies – a cost-efficient demand-pull strategy. This concept of cost-efficient demand-pull strategies can be illustrated using the concept of learning curves (cf. Figure 1). Learning curves impose a functional relationship between the deployment of a technology and its cost development. They describe to which extent the diffusion of a technology leads to cost reductions due to learning feedbacks from production and use phases as well as due to economies of scale. Figure 1 depicts a MPT with three distinct applications (A, B and C), of which application C is needed most in the long run53. The vertical axis shows the costs of that MPT and the normalized economic value of the application (in grey dashed lines), while the deployment of the technology and the market size of the applications are shown in the horizontal axis. The distance between the technology costs and the economic value of the application represents the profitability gap of the technology in this application. The profitability gap multiplied by the size of the application results in the total costs of demand-pull support for an application (indicated by the shaded areas in Figure 1). Policy makers can induce moving down the learning curve by supporting not initially application C but instead by first supporting diffusion in the application with the smallest profitability gap (application A). When cost reductions from deployment in application A improved the profitability of application B, policy makers can switch diffusion policies towards the next application (B). The proposed cost-efficient demand-pull policy strategy results in smaller total costs per unit of installed capacity compared to the case where the policy maker would install demand-pull policies exclusively for application C. In case of high learning potential of the MPTs and high differences between the economic value of applications A, B and C, even the total costs of sequentially supporting applications A, B and C are smaller compared to the case of exclusive support for application C (cf. Appendix A). 53 It is assumed that policy makers target application C in the long run due to, e.g., high positive externalities. However, investors or operators of the MPT can achieve a higher economic value in the applications A and B (excl. positive or negative externalities). 95 The concept of cost-efficient demand-pull policy strategy rests on two main conditions: (i) the technology in focus has clearly differentiated and economically relevant applications and is thus a multi-purpose technology; (ii) the profitability gaps of the different applications vary significantly. To support our argumentation, these two conditions are tested for stationary electricity storage (SES) in one step each. Section 3 highlights the multi-purpose character of SES based on a comprehensive literature review of SES applications. Section 4 shows that the profitability gap of a specific SES technology (vanadium redox flow battery) varies strongly across SES applications resulting in different support needs. FIGURE 1: SCHEMATIC ILLUSTRATION OF A COST-EFFICIENT DEMAND-PULL STRATEGY FOR APPLICATION C 3. The multi-purpose character of stationary electricity storage technologies In this section, the multi-purpose character of stationary electricity storage (SES) is derived in two steps. First, as the key characteristic of a multi-purpose technology (MPT) is the existence of multiple distinct applications, a comprehensive literature review on SES application is conducted. Second, an economic framework is introduced defining SES applications along the dimensions of source of economic value and customer / user group – the two dimension that were employed to define MPT application in section 2.1. Cost of demand-pull policy Deployment (installed capacity) Application A Application B Application C Technology cost / value of applicationa a Normalized economic value per installed unit of technology that can be achieved by the investor or operator of the MPT (excl. positive and negative externalities) Application A Market is working without policy support Deployment of technology in… Application B Application C 96 The first step, the literature review on SES applications, included both reports published by leading institutions and scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals. These publications covered a wide spectrum of different scientific fields ranging from economics, over chemistry to engineering. Table 1 lists the reviewed publications on SES applications giving information on type, number of applications and logic of structuring applications. From Table 1, two major points can be derived. First, the number of applications varies strongly across publications ranging from 3 to 17. Thus, a common understanding of SES applications and how to define them seems to be missing in literature. Second, most publications map applications along either technical requirements (e.g., power-vs.-energy/ discharge duration) or the location in the electricity supply chain or a combination of both. Therefore, current classification schemes of SES applications are strongly influenced by technical and physical parameters of applications. In the second step, the physical and technical mapping of SES applications was translated in an economic framework of SES applications. This economic framework is structured along the source of economic value and the location in the electricity supply chain – the two dimensions that were used to define applications of multi-purpose technologies (Section 2.1) adapted to the context of the power sector. To validate and further refine the economic framework we performed a series of expert interviews54. From the literature review and expert interviews, four different sources of economic value from electricity storage were identified: Power Quality, Power Reliability, Increased Utilization of Existing Assets, and Arbitrage. The location in the electricity supply chain adapts the user / customer group dimension to the power system and is structured in three main steps (Generation, Transmission & Distribution, and End-consumer). Figure 2 shows the economic framework of storage applications along the two dimensions of source of economic value and location in the electricity supply chain resulting in fourteen distinct applications. In the following, these fourteen applications are shortly described grouped by their source of value creation. 54Twelve expert interviews were conducted between February 2012 and March 2013. The interview participants were researchers from universities or research institutes as well as practitioners from companies in the energy sector. Extensive experience with energy storage was a prerequisite for the selection of interview participants. In the interviews earlier versions of the economic framework for SES applications were discussed, refined and validated. An overview of experts interviewed can be found in appendix E. 97 TABLE 1: PUBLICATIONS DEFINING DIFFERENT STATIONARY ELECTRICITY STORAGE APPLICATIONS Author (year) Classification logic Number of applications Main application categories Barton and Infield (2004) Power-vs.-energy / Discharge duration 8 - Chen et al.

Consequently, these applications create economic value by ensuring power supply without deviations from the optimal frequency and voltage level. On the Generation level, SES devices can enable RETs to deliver electricity without any voltage sacks or harmonic distortions (RET Smoothing). On the Transmission & Distribution level, SES can be employed to maintain grid frequency at the required level (Area & Frequency Regulation) or to support the voltage level by providing flicker compensation and reactive power control in combination with additional electrical equipment as, for example, flexible AC transmission systems (Voltage Regulation). SES can also provide these services exclusively to specific end-consumers that have high requirements to the power quality as, for instance, high-precision manufacturing (End-consumer Power Quality). Power Reliability applications create economic value by helping guarantee an uninterrupted power supply. As most power generation plants require electricity to start, Black Start is one highly relevant SES applications on the Generation level.

End- consumer Power Reliability assures uninterrupted power supply exclusively for specific customers which, for instance, have very high costs in case of a black out (e.g., data centers). Increased Utilization of Existing Assets applications create economic value by improving the use and value of existing generation or transmission capacity and thereby avoiding or deferring additional investments. In combination with a conventional generation unit, a SES device can balance fluctuations in demand while the generation unit runs in its optimal load at maximum efficiency (Load Following). Together with SES, intermittent renewables can provide dispatchable energy (RET Firming) 56. While in Load Following the economic value is generated from the gain in efficiency of the conventional generation unit, the economic value in RET Firming results from compliance with regulations or from reduced investment need in generation capacity. An SES installed at a grid transmission bottleneck can be employed to shave transmission peaks and thus defer investment in additional transmission capacities (T&D Investment Deferral). End-consumers with generation capacity (e.g., photovoltaics) can increase the amount of self-consumed energy by adding SES (Increase of Self-consumption). This application creates value for the operator by replacing power purchase from the grid. Arbitrage applications use price differentials to create economic value for the SES operator. RET Arbitrage stores energy produced from intermittent renewables in order to sell it when the power prices are high. Wholesale Arbitrage buys energy at the power markets at low prices and sells it again when prices peak. End-consumer Arbitrage uses prices differentials in electricity contracts. For example, utilities offer contracts for private consumers with different prices for electricity consumption during the day and at night. Moreover, industrial companies often have combined contracts paying for the electricity consumed and for the yearly maximum power provided separately. A SES used to shave consumption peaks can lower the latter aspect considerably. In summary, the economic framework of SES applications underscores the multi-purpose character of SES. It shows that SES can create value in different ways and for different customer groups resulting in 14 distinct applications in the power system 57. In the next section, an exemplary profitability 55 While Area & Frequency Regulation refers to very short-term imbalances in demand and supply (similar to spinning reserve or primary frequency regulation), Reserve Capacity refers to imbalances of longer durations (similar to non- spinning reserve, minute reserve or cold reserve). 56 In island grids as, for instance, Hawaii operators of large wind and photovoltaic power generation capacity are required to deploy large energy storage facilities in order to meet the reliability provisions imposed by power purchasing agreements (IHS Emerging Energy Research LLC, 2011). 57 It shall be noted that although from a systemic point of view the SES applications are mutually exclusive, one specific storage installation might be able to serve several applications sequentially or even simultaneously (He et al., 2011). For instance, a battery installation in a private household might be able to serve simultaneously both Increase of Self- consumption and Energy Management. However, the combinability of application is limited by operational, technical, physical and regulatory factors. As a result, most applications are incompatible or only partially combinable. 100 assessment of one SES technology is performed to analyze to which extent the profitability varies across SES applications. 4. Profitability assessment of a SES technology across power system applications Whereas the last section exemplified the multi-purpose character of SES, this section introduces the methodology and results of the profitability assessment of one SES technology across five selected power system applications. The profitability assessment is conducted for a stationary battery technology – vanadium redox flow58 – as this technology can serve both applications with a high power (e.g., Area & Frequency Regulation) and a high energy rating (e.g., End-consumer Arbitrage) due to its modular design and flexibility. Thus, vanadium redox flow is a good case to exemplify the variation of profitability as it can technically be employed in almost all SES applications (cf. Section 3). Moreover, vanadium redox flow was chosen as its core design is almost identical across applications and as it is generally regarded as a technology with very high potential for stationary electricity storage (Sauer et al., 2011; Wietschel et al., 2010)59. The five SES applications Wholesale Arbitrage, Area & Frequency Regulation, End -consumer Arbitrage, End- consumer Reliability and Increase of Self-consumption were chosen as they represent a wide range of possible SES use cases in the power system covering both grid-scale and end-consumer as well as power and energy applications. Moreover, they are either already very prominent in the discussion on SES applications – Wholesale Arbitrage, End-consumer Reliability and Area & Frequency Regulation (Sioshansi et al., 2009; Wagner, 1997) – or they are expected to become relevant especially for battery technologies – End-consumer Arbitrage, and Increase of Self- consumption (Sauer et al., 2011). All applications are evaluated in the setting of the German electricity market. Given the high and increasing shares of intermittent RETs as well as first demand- pull policies for SES (KfW, 2013), Germany is a relevant case example to assess the profitability of SES. 58 A description of this technology can be found in Dunn et al. (2011). 59 However, it shall be noted that also other stationary electricity storage technologies could have been assessed to exemplify the variation in profitability. The selection of vanadium redox flow is just an example and shall not imply that policy maker should pick this or any other specific technology. 101 4.1 Methodology of the profitability assessment A techno-economic model with two interrelated modules is employed to simulate the profitability of vanadium redox flow across SES applications. In general, the model calculates the profitability of SES technologies based on costs input from module A and application value input from module B. A Monte Carlo simulation is employed to account for the present uncertainty in raw data inputs both on the costs and the value side. Figure 3 gives an overview of data and methodology as well as it indicates the respective subsections. FIGURE 3: OVERVIEW OF METHODOLOGY AND INPUT DATA FOR PROFITABILITY ASSESSMENT As the main input parameters of both vanadium redox flow and the input values for estimation of the economic values exhibit a high degree of uncertainty (Battke et al., 2013), the profitability assessment employs a Monte Carlo simulation to systemically account for this uncertainty. The Monte Carlo simulation is a “statistical numerical method used for solving mathematical problems” (Jacoboni and Reggiani, 1983, p. 648), using repeated sampling from distributions of stochastic input parameters. The resulting output values of the calculation converge, based on the law of large numbers, to their theoretical distributions. For each stochastic input parameter, the underlying distribution and the corresponding distributional parameters have to be provided as input parameters for the Monte Carlo simulation. In case “maximum”, “minimum” and “most likely” value of stochastic input parameters could be retrieved a Cycle life as function of average depth-of-discharge b Based on market prices, costs of competing technologies or inherent value COST / TECHNOLOGY DATA (Appendix A) MODULE A: TECHNOLOGY COST CALCULATION (Section 4.1.1) ▪ Stochastic input parameters – Energy capacity costs – Roundtrip efficiency – Calendrical life – Cycle lifea ▪ Deterministic input parameters – Power conversion system costs – Balance-of-plant costs – Operations & maintenance costs COST / TECHNOLOGY DATA (Appendix B) MODULE B: APPLICATION VALUE CALCULATION (Section 4.1.2) BENEFIT / APPLICATION DATA (Appendix C) ▪ Stochastic input parameters – Economic valueb – Electricity price ▪ Deterministic input parameters – Required power rating – Required energy rating – Cycle frequency – Discharge duration – Discount rate MONTE CARLO SIMULATION AND PROFITABILITY CALCULATION 102 from literature or expert interviews, the PERT distribution was assumed60. In case only the “maximum” and “minimum” values of the stochastic input parameters were available, a uniform distribution was assumed. Input data as well as distributional assumptions for the stochastic vanadium redox flow and application parameters can be found in appendix B and appendix C, respectively. Each Monte Carlo simulation was conducted with 10,000 runs with six stochastic input parameters: Electricity price, economic value of the application, energy capacity costs, roundtrip efficiency, calendric life and cycle life 61. An integrated assessment of the profitability of battery technologies under uncertainty is conducted by simulating both the cost and the value side simultaneously in each Monte Carlo run. The resulting distribution of the profitability of vanadium redox flow across SES applications calculated as annual profit (or loss) per installed electric capacity in EUR/kW-yr is the final output of the Monte Carlo simulation. Formula 1 expresses the functional relationship of profit, economic value and costs. ( ) ( ) (1) 4.1.1. Module A: Technology cost calculation In module A of the techno-economic model the levelized lifecycle costs of vanadium redox flow are calculated for the five different SES applications. These applications differ not only with respect to their required power rating, energy rating and discharge duration but also with respect to the electricity price, discount rate and cycle frequency resulting in different replacement intervals and operating costs (Battke et al., 2013). Consequently, an assessment of vanadium redox flow costs based only on investment costs would be misleading. Thus, module A calculates the levelized lifecycle costs of vanadium redox flow across SES applications in two steps. First, the required system size (in MW and MWh) is calculated for each application as a function of the application parameters required energy rating, required power rating and discharge duration in combination with the technical parameters roundtrip efficiency and 60 The PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) is based on the beta distribution and is recommended for data from literature reviews and expert interviews as it puts more emphasize on, compared to the triangular distribution, the “most likely” value (Brown et al., 2001; Vose et al., 2007). 61 The six stochastic input parameters were assumed to be mutually uncorrelated. However, the electricity price is an input parameter for both the cost and the value side of the profitability assessment. fMC: Distribution generated by the Monte Carlo simulation LCOEC: Levelized costs of electric capacity [EUR/kW-yr] (cf. Section 4.1.1) i: Application specific index j: Technology specific index 103 maximum depth-of-discharge62. Second, lifecycle costs in terms of levelized costs of electric capacity (LCOEC) are calculated. The LCOEC compare the total costs (capital expenditures and operating costs) that arise during the lifetime of a technology to the installed electric capacity on an annual basis (EPRI, 2010). This concept can be employed to compare the costs of one or more technologies across different applications accounting for difference in capital expenditures, operating costs, efficiency and lifetime63. The calculation of the LCOEC is given in the Formula 2 (adopted from Madlener and Latz (2013)). ∑ (2) The cost and technology input data is retrieved from Battke et al. (2013) as they base their input values on an extensive literature review supplemented with expert interviews and provide ranges for the stochastic input parameters. An overview of the input data used can be found in appendix B. 4.1.2. Module B: Value calculation per application In module B of the techno-economic model the annual economic value of applications (in EUR/kW- yr), that can be achieved by the investor or SES operator (i.e. excluding positive or negative externalities), is estimated. In contrast to the calculation of the lifecycle costs of vanadium redox flow which is based on the same technical data and calculations across applications, the estimation of the economic value is more complex: Because the source of economic value and the competing technologies differ across applications, the calculation methods to estimate the economic value also differ across applications. 62 In order to account for efficiency losses and maximum depth-of-discharge, the battery system size is increased to meet the required discharge duration (in h) for the respective application. Depth-of-discharge refers to the energy withdrawn as percentage of the total energy capacity of the battery system. 63 An alternative way to assess levelized lifecycle costs of batteries would be to calculate the levelized costs of electricity (LCOE). The LCOE set the total costs that arise during the lifetime of a technology in relation to the lifetime electricity production (Darling et al., 2011). In other words, the LCOE express the costs in terms of delivered electricity (in EUR/kWh), while the LCOEC express the costs in terms of installed electric capacity (in EUR/kW-yr). LCOEC: Levelized costs of electric capacity [EUR/kW-yr] CAPEX: Investment costs [EUR] OPEX: Operation & maintenance costs [EUR] kW_year: Installed electric capacity [kW-yr] r: Discount rate [%] T: System lifetime [years] t: year 104 As so far no universal proposal exists that allows estimating the value of SES applications, we propose the following methodology to calculate the economic value of SES applications 64. In general, the estimation of the economic value of an application can be based either on price signals form markets or contracts, or on the costs of the best non-storage technology to fulfill the application, or on the inherent value of the application 65. A hierarchical, two-step heuristic can be defined to select one of the three options: The economic evaluation of SES applications should generally be based on price signals from markets or contracts, or – in case no price signals exist – on the minimum of the inherent value of the application and the costs of the cheapest non-storage technology. This heuristic can be translated into two questions (cf. Figure 4) and is explained in detail in the following. FIGURE 4: SELECTION HEURISTIC FOR ECONOMIC VALUE CALCULATION OF SES APPLICATIONS 1. Do price signals from markets or contracts exist for the application? Price signals from markets or contracts exist for several SES applications; and if this is the case the estimation of the SES application value should be based on these price signals as market based price signals by definition aggregate information about the value of the service (the inherent value of the application, i.e., demand curve) and the cost of providing this service (the cost of best non-storage 64 Preceding publications on SES applications lack a clear methodology how to evaluate the economic value of applications. This literature can broadly be divided in two streams. First, mostly scientific publications in technical or energy journals estimate the value of one specific SES application leveraging advanced techno-economic models or simulations tools (Bathurst and Strbac, 2003; Walawalkar et al., 2007; Benitez et al., 2008; Sioshansi et al., 2009). Second, reports by research institutes tend to estimate the value of several applications or markets with rather simple calculations (Schoenung and Eyer, 2008; EPRI, 2010). Yet both streams do not define a general, systematic methodology how to estimate the value of SES applications. 65 The inherent value of an application can be approximated by identifying the economic effect of the SES device in this application. Do price signals from markets or contracts exist for the application? …price signals from markets or contracts for this application Evaluation of the economic value of an stationary electricity storage application based on… …the costs of the best non-storage technology to fulfill the application …the inherent value of this application Is inherent value of the application higher than the costs of the best non-storage technology? No Yes Yes No 1 2 105 competing technology, i.e., supply curve). Thus, market based price signals already contain all information that is necessary to estimate the economic value of an SES application. In Germany, markets or contracts exist for three of the five SES applications analyzed in this paper. Price signals for Wholesale Arbitrage can be retrieved from the day-ahead spot market at the European Energy Exchange (EEX). Moreover, the EEX also provides information about past auctions results for primary frequency control that can be employed to estimate the value of Area & Frequency Regulation (Tennet TSO GmbH et al., 2012). Finally, contracts from utilities for private households offering different tariffs for electricity consumption during peak and off- peak hours serve as sources for price signals for End-consumer Arbitrage. Thus, as for these three applications reliable price signals from markets or contracts exist, the estimation of the economic value is based on them. For the two applications End-consumer Power Reliability and Increase of Self-consumption reliable price signals from markets or contracts could not be identified. Hence, for these two applications the second question becomes relevant. 2. Is the inherent value of the application higher than the costs of the best non-storage technology? In case that markets or contracts providing reliable price signals cannot be identified, the estimation of the economic value of the SES application should be based on the minimum of the inherent value of the application and the costs of the cheapest non-storage competing technology that can be used to fulfill this application. The inherent value of an application can be approximated by identifying the economic effect of the SES device. The inherent value of End-consumer Power Reliability is the avoided loss from an average outage (“value of lost load”). However, if an alternative non-storage technology exists that can also fulfill this application, the costs of this alternative technology need to be compared with the inherent value. For example, although the value of lost load as the inherent value of End- consumer Power Reliability might be high, a standard diesel generator is often employed to serve this application. A customer of this application would not be willing to pay the inherent value if there was a cheaper option to serve this application. Therefore, in case of End-consumer Power Reliability the estimation of the value is based on the minimum of the value of lost load and the levelized costs of a diesel generator66. With a limited potential of demand side management to shift electricity consumption from day to night time, SES electricity storage has no competing technology in case of the Increase of Self-consumption application. Thus, the estimation of the 66 In the case of Germany, the inherent value (value of lost load) of this application is significantly lower than the price of best non-storage competing technology (diesel generator) (cf. Appendix D). This result is to a large extent driven by the fact that power outages are very rare events in the German power system. In other countries (e.g., India) or for specific industries (e.g., data centers) the inherent value is much higher resulting in positive business cases of battery technologies in this application. 106 economic value of this application is based on the inherent value of this application which is a function of the buy and sell price of electricity to the utility. The economic values of the five SES applications were estimated using the German electricity market. Appendix C gives an overview of calculation, data and sources employed in the estimation of the economic value for the five applications in focus. 4.2 Results of the profitability assessment The results generated by the probabilistic profitability model are summarized in Figure 5, in which the distribution of profitability in terms of annual profit (or loss) per installed electric storage capacity [in EUR/kw-yr] is shown. The bars in the chart represent the 90% of the profitability values generated by the Monte Carlo simulation ranging from the 5% percentile over the mean to the 95% percentile for each application. FIGURE 5: ANNUAL ECONOMIC PROFIT PER INSTALLED ELECTRIC CAPACITY OF VANADIUM REDOX FLOW Comparing the absolute profitability estimates in Figure 5 with the ones from preceding studies on the profitability of storage technologies is difficult as methodology and input data need to be similar for technologies, application parameters and for economic value estimates. However, the ranking of applications in terms of economic value can be compared. The ranking of applications is well aligned with preceding studies: Both EPRI (2010) and Eyer and Corey (2010) rank Area & Frequency -550 -500 -450 -400 -350 -300 -250 -200 -150 -100 -50 0 50 End-consumer Arbitrage -549 EUR/kW-yr Area & Frequency Regulation -178 End-consumer Power Reliability -188 Increase of Self-consumption -328 Wholesale Arbitrage -536 Mean 95% percentile 5% percentile -387 -361 -144 -207 -84 -242 -203 -104 -98 1 107 Regulation the highest, followed by Increase of Self-consumption and End-consumer Power Reliability, ending with Wholesale Arbitrage at the lower end 67. Three main results can be derived from the techno-economic profitability modeling. First, the mean profitability values for vanadium redox flow are still negative across all applications. Thus, current vanadium redox flow installations struggle to reach a positive return for operators. This exemplifies the limited investment in SES underlining the case for demand-pull support polices to enable diffusion of these technologies 68. Second, the mean profitability values vary significantly across applications. An Anova test was conducted testing whether the means of profitability distributions are equal across applications. This hypothesis could be rejected at a significance level of 0.1%. While in Area & Frequency Regulation vanadium redox flow can come close to profitability, the profitability gap is significantly larger in the other SES applications as, for instance, Wholesale Arbitrage and End-consumer Arbitrage. Third, the level of uncertainty in profitability varies across applications. As a rule, as the uncertainty in vanadium redox flow input parameters is the highest in energy related investment costs and cycle life, frequently used applications or applications with a high discharge duration exhibit the highest uncertainty on the technology side. On the application side, economic value estimate based on price signals from markets or contracts exhibit lower uncertainty as economic value estimates based on the minimum of inherent value and cost of alternative non-storage technology. Generally, in the case of vanadium redox flow the uncertainty on the technology side outweighs the uncertainty on the economic value side. The main purpose of the techno-economic modeling was to support the general relevance of the idea of a cost-efficient demand-pull strategy with quantitative data for one technology across applications. The strongly varying profitability of vanadium redox flow across five SES applications shown in Figure 5 endorses the main argument of this paper: Policy makers can implement a cost-efficient demand-pull policy strategy for multi-purpose technologies as stationary electricity storage. For instance, in the case of vanadium redox flow, policy makers could first select the SES application with the smallest profitability gap (e.g., Area & Frequency Regulation), and thereby improving the profitability also in the SES application that is likely to become highly relevant in the power system yet currently exhibits a large profitability gap (e.g., Wholesale Arbitrage or RET Firming). 67 The position of Area & Frequency Regulation can be explained by a favorable combination of economic value (high annual payments for this ancillary service) and technical requirements (short required discharge duration) of this application. 68 It shall be noted that there are some exceptions leading to minor niche markets with profitable business cases for stationary batteries (e.g., End-consumer power reliability for data centers, RET Firming off-grid / islands), however market sizes in these niches are not sufficient to realize substantial technological learning. 108 Consequently, with pure focus on cost-efficiency, the current policy support for Increase of Self- consumption in Germany (KfW, 2013) might not be the optimal choice. 5. Discussion In section 2 to section 4, we have argued that policy makers are able to implement cost-efficient demand-pull strategies for multi-purpose technologies, such as stationary electricity storage, due to the existence of multiple distinct applications and strong variation of profitability levels across these applications. This argument has been supported by exemplifying the multi-purpose character of SES and by assessing the variation in profitability of one SES technology across five applications. However, in order for this line of argumentation to be valid, there are several underlying assumptions and limitations that shall be discussed in this section. First, the main precondition for the presented argumentation is that the market mechanism fails to provide sufficient incentives for the investment in the respective technology due to positive external effects in form of learning spillovers from production and use phases that are difficult to appropriate by the investor (Gillingham and Sweeney, 2010; van Benthem et al., 2007). Without this assumption, demand-pull policies themselves are questionable. However, in the case of most clean energy technologies as SES, this precondition seems to be fulfilled. Therefore, practitioners and scholars are mostly aligned regarding demand-pull policies as appropriate means to foster technological learning and innovation for these technologies (Gross et al., 2012; IRENA, 2012b; Krajačić et al., 2011b; Sagar and van der Zwaan, 2006). Second, the concept of a cost-efficient demand-pull strategy for multi-purpose technologies rests on the assumption that technological designs do not strongly differ across applications. This assumption implies that cost reductions obtained through the deployment of a technology in one application are transferred to other applications. For the technology focused upon in this paper – stationary electricity storage – this assumption seems to be reasonable. For instance, although the cell design might differ between high energy and high power applications, innovation and learning is still strongly transferred across applications (Schoenung and Hassenzahl, 2003). Third, it shall be noted that cost efficiency is not the only criteria to select applications to support. Additional factors such as technological diversity, political feasibility and external effects of the applications need to be taken into consideration for the decision which application to support. For instance, research has shown that diffusion policies can lead to a premature lock-in in the technology that currently exhibits the most favorable economics (“close to the market”) as companies shift resources from research and development towards production capacity in case strong diffusion policies 109 are in place (del Río, 2012; Hoppmann et al., 2013). Such a premature lock-in can entail long-term inefficiencies and reduce the resilience of the system (van den Bergh, 2008). Thus, demand-pull policies should also be designed to minimize the risk of technological lock-in. Fourth, policy makers have to be aware that the technological development and the economics of applications are dynamic and uncertain. Technology and application parameters can change over time, but also value drivers and competing technologies are non-constant. Moreover, new applications can emerge over time creating new markets and opportunities for technologies. Also, although learning curves are often used to forecast technological development, the exact cost development of a technology is uncertain as technological stagnation or breakthroughs can emerge any time (Taylor and Fujita, 2013; Yeh and Rubin, 2012). Finally, although industrial and energy policy is typically set on a national level, the evolution of a technology is shaped by events or developments across countries. For instance, strong deployment of a technology in one country is likely to trigger also cost reductions in other countries (Peters et al., 2012) 69 . Thus, although a cost-efficient strategic order of demand-pull policies can be planned upfront, it has to be updated regularly and adapted to new circumstances. 6. Conclusion The principal result of this paper is that policy makers can implement a cost-efficient demand-pull strategy for multi-purpose technologies, such as stationary electricity storage (SES), due to the existence of multiple distinct applications and the strong variation of profitability across these applications. Two main contributions lead to this argumentation. First, a definition and characterization of multi-purpose technologies was introduced. Second, the concept of cost-efficient demand-pull policy strategies was developed. To support our argumentation, the multi-purpose character of stationary electricity storage (SES) was exemplified by proposing an economic framework of SES applications. Moreover, employing a novel methodology, an exemplary profitability assessment of one SES technology (vanadium redox flow battery) was conducted highlighting the varying profitability levels of this technology across SES applications. Four main avenues for further research emerge from the present analysis. First, subsequent research could extend the selection methodology of applications for demand-pull policies including aspects as technological diversity, political feasibility and external effects. Second, it could be investigated which 69 However, it has to be noted that the degree that cost reductions are transferred across countries depends on the cost structure of the respective technology. For instance, for a technology with a high share of engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) costs, cost reductions in one country are unlikely to be transferred completely to other countries (Seel et al., 2013). 110 deployment instruments (e.g., tax credit, feed-in tariff) are most appropriate in the case of SES (del Río González, 2008). Third, learning spillovers between technologies can affect the technological development significantly (Nemet, 2012) and thus have to be understood thoroughly. Finally, the implications of the concept of multi-purpose technologies on innovation economics literature could be analyzed further. For instance, the multi-purpose concept implies – among others – that a technology can have several very distinct markets, that these markets can vary in their technical requirements and in their economics, and that a technology can evolve sequentially in different markets. This notion could be relevant for, for instance, the literature on niche management (Kemp et al., 1998; Nill and Kemp, 2009). 111 7.

Schmidta,b, Stephan Stollenwerk a, Volker H. Hoffmanna a Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich), Department of Management, Technology, and Economics, Chair of Sustainability and Technology, Weinbergstrasse 56/58, CH- 8092 Zurich, Switzerland; b Stanford University, Precourt Energy Efficiency Center, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, California 94305, USA 124 Abstract Literature on technological change has highlighted the importance of the cumulative character of knowledge. Typically, knowledge produced in a technology inspires subsequent knowledge within the same technology. But knowledge spillovers across technologies can also occur, i.e., technologies can benefit from knowledge that originated in other technologies. Such spillovers support technological variety, one potential goal of technology policy. The extant literature on knowledge diffusion, however, has not been able to explain which characteristics of knowledge increase the likelihood that knowledge will remain within its own technological field or spill over to other technologies. To address this gap, in this paper we test a set of hypotheses on how the degree of specialization and centrality of knowledge affect the subsequent flow of this knowledge within and across technologies. Drawing upon a comprehensive set of more than 40,000 battery patents, we show that compared to diversified knowledge, specialized knowledge is more likely to be related to intra-technology knowledge flows, and less likely to be related to knowledge spillovers to other technologies. Similarly, compared to peripheral knowledge, core knowledge is more likely to go along with intra-technology knowledge flows and less likely to spill over to other technologies. These findings have important implications for the design of science, technology and innovation policy. Policy measures that encourage the development of specialized and core knowledge are likely to foster the development of stable technological trajectories, whereas measures targeted at developing diversified and peripheral knowledge more strongly contribute to technological variety. Highlights  Investigates the mechanisms determining the direction of knowledge flows  Bridges the literature streams on knowledge flows and product architecture  Tests four hypotheses in a sample of 42,619 global battery patents  Specialized and core knowledge increase within-technology knowledge flows  Derives implications for literature on technological evolution and for policy makers Keywords innovation, knowledge spillovers, cumulative synthesis, product architecture, technological trajectories, patents 125 1. Introduction Technological change is a critical determinant of economic development (Schumpeter, 1934). A key characteristic of technological change is that technological innovation builds upon prior existing knowledge (Dosi, 1982). Technological evolution is typically shaped by problem solving activity which integrates knowledge from the same technology, leveraging the cumulative character of knowledge. Thus, typically the knowledge produced in a technology remains within the same technology. However, knowledge spillovers across technologies also occur, i.e., knowledge can be valuable for technologies in different technological domains. Consequently, while some knowledge has the tendency to generate knowledge flows mostly within the same technology, reinforcing the existing technological trajectories and thereby locking-in specific technologies, other knowledge generates spillovers across technologies and thus has the potential to increase technological variety (van den Bergh, 2008; Schoenmakers and Duysters, 2010). From a policy perspective, this is of high relevance as technological variety and lock-in of technologies are prominent themes in both the practical and theoretical debate (del Río González, 2008). In this paper, we aim to improve the understanding of which kind of knowledge has the tendency to generate knowledge flows within and across technologies. Previous literature on technological knowledge flows has focused on the question of which knowledge has a high propensity to generate subsequent knowledge flows, with the strength of this propensity typically being used to approximate the value or radicalness of an invention (Schoenmakers and Duysters, 2010; Nemet, 2012; Nemet and Johnson, 2012). These studies analyzed, among others, the effect of the degree of specialization of knowledge (i.e., the integration of different kinds of prior art) on the totality of knowledge flows, yet they did not distinguish the technologies benefiting from these knowledge flows. In other words, the previous literature did not distinguish whether these knowledge flows remain within the same technology, thereby reinforcing the established trajectory, or whether the knowledge was transferred to different technologies in the form of knowledge spillovers. Only very recently, Noailly and Shestalova (2013) presented a discussion paper that differentiates knowledge flows within and across technologies. Yet they did not investigate what characteristics of knowledge lead to different knowledge flows. Consequently, we lack an understanding of which characteristics of knowledge increase the likelihood of knowledge flows within or across technologies. To address this gap, this paper investigates how two important characteristics of knowledge, namely the degree of specialization and centrality, affect the likelihood of generating subsequent knowledge flows within or across technologies. We define the differentiation between knowledge flows within and across technologies as the “direction of knowledge flows.” 126 The first characteristic, the degree of specialization, describes whether the technological knowledge is specialized or diversified. “Specialized knowledge” mainly integrates prior art (i.e., prior existing knowledge) from the same technology; “diversified knowledge” mainly integrates prior art from different technologies. Thus far, studies have analyzed the effect of this characteristic on the totality of knowledge flows, without differentiating their direction (Schoenmakers and Duysters, 2010; Nemet, 2012; Nemet and Johnson, 2012). Yet, these studies have not come to conclusive empirical results on the effects of the degree of specialization of knowledge. The second characteristic builds upon the product architecture literature and describes how central the knowledge is to a technology. Specifically, it distinguishes between “core knowledge” (i.e., knowledge on core components of a technology) and “peripheral knowledge” (i.e., knowledge on peripheral components of a technology). While the product architecture literature has proven its value for several aspects of technical change and innovation (Tushman and Rosenkopf, 1992; Murmann and Frenken, 2006), it has not yet been used in studies explaining knowledge flows within or across technologies. In order to explore our research question, we investigate knowledge flows within and across three battery technologies (lead-acid, lithium-ion, and nickel). Batteries are chosen as a research case because of inventors’ high propensity to patent knowledge on battery technologies and because of the comparability in the product architecture of batteries, which facilitates our analysis. We measure knowledge flows using forward citations between battery patents, employing a comprehensive data set consisting of 42,619 patents and 106,548 forward citations. To analyze this data set, we use a negative binomial regression model. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, by differentiating knowledge flows by their direction, we show that different mechanisms determine knowledge flows within and across technologies. This helps to explain contradictory empirical results in previous studies on technological knowledge flows. Second, we link the existing literature on knowledge flows, which has mostly centered on the degree of specialization, to the literature on product architecture introducing the centrality of the knowledge as a second explanatory factor. Our analysis indicates that the degree of centrality of knowledge is highly relevant to knowledge flows and improves the understanding of technological knowledge diffusion. Third, we discuss the implications of our analysis for the literature on knowledge diffusion, and, more generally, on technological evolution, as well as for technology policy. The remainder of this article is structured as follows: Section 2 sets out our theoretical argumentation and develops hypotheses on the degree of specialization (2.1) and centrality of knowledge (2.2). Section 3 describes the scope, theoretical sampling, data set and methodology employed to test the 127 hypotheses. The regression results are presented in section 4 and discussed in section 5, where implications for theory and policy are derived. The paper ends with a short conclusion in section 6. 2. Theory and hypotheses It has long been acknowledged by scholars that the construct of knowledge plays a key role in attempts to explain the origins and dynamics of technological change. Based on the early work of Gilfillan (1935) and Usher (1954), research has tried to track the origins of inventions, leading to a large number of studies dealing with knowledge flows, knowledge spillovers and the characteristics of knowledge. Within this area, a central concept is that novel technologies build upon and recombine existing knowledge from near and distant technologies. Consequently, existing knowledge can be transferred to subsequent knowledge in the same or different technologies, a fact that can be described by knowledge flows within and across technologies. In the following, we discuss two characteristics of knowledge, the degree of specialization and centrality, which are likely to affect the likelihood that flows occur within or across technologies. 71 Figure 1 gives an overview of the design of the study and the nomenclature used in the remainder of the paper. In our study, knowledge flows refer to knowledge that is transferred to subsequent knowledge. The direction differentiates knowledge flows according to the distance of the recipient technology, i.e., it differentiates knowledge flows within and across technologies. To improve the understanding of the drivers of the direction of knowledge flows, we build hypotheses on the effect of the degree of specialization (2.1) and centrality (2.2) of knowledge. 71 Although both explanatory factors describe continuous characteristics, we use extreme points (i.e., specialized vs. diversified knowledge, core vs. peripheral knowledge) in order to derive the theoretical reasoning. In the analysis we differentiate the explanatory factors the degree of specialization and centrality of knowledge into three and four variables, respectively. 128 FIGURE 1: OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH FRAMEWORK AND NOMENCLATURE 2.1 The effect of the degree of specialization of knowledge The first knowledge characteristic of interest for our study is the degree of specialization of knowledge, which we define as the degree to which a technology integrates prior art (i.e., prior existing knowledge) that originated in the same or different technologies. Thus far, the extant literature has mostly been concerned with the question of how the degree of specialization affects the likelihood of generating a high amount of knowledge flows in order to approximate the value or radicalness of an invention. In particular, previous studies have tested whether diversified knowledge, i.e., knowledge that primarily integrates prior art from distant technologies, or specialized knowledge, i.e., knowledge that primarily integrates prior art from the same technology, exerts a stronger effect on subsequent knowledge flows (Benner and Waldfogel, 2008; Gilsing et al., 2008). As we will show in the following, thus far the literature has not developed a conclusive answer to this question either through theoretical reasoning or empirical analyses. Scholars arguing that diversified knowledge is more likely to generate knowledge flows than specialized knowledge typically refer to the positive impact of combining existing knowledge from different areas into new artifacts (Schumpeter, 1934; Gilfillan, 1935; Nelson and Winter, 1982; Arthur, 1989; Nemet and Johnson, 2012). Usher (1954) described the innovation process as “cumulative synthesis,” which stresses the central role that combining different artifacts plays in the generation of inventions. As expressed by Arthur (2009, p. 21), “novel technologies arise by Characteristics of knowledge Direction of knowledge flows (1) Degree of specialization Specialized knowledgeDiversified knowledge Knowledge that integrates primarily prior art from the same technology Knowledge that integrates primarily prior art from different technologies highlow Knowledge flows across technologies Knowledge flows within technologies Knowledge that flows to a different technology than the one in which it was originated Knowledge that flows to the same technology in which it was originated (2) Degree of centrality Core knowledgePeripheral knowledge high Knowledge that focuses on core components of a technology Knowledge that focuses on peripheral components of a technology low 129 combination of existing technologies” and “existing technologies beget further technologies.” Combining knowledge from several distinct areas may also lead to “breakthrough ideas” (van den Bergh, 2008; Schilling and Green, 2011). Hence, this line of argumentation expects that diversified knowledge is likely to generate a higher number of knowledge flows than specialized knowledge (i.e., a stronger effect of technologically distant prior art on knowledge flows). Several empirical results support this argument. For instance, Schoenmakers and Duysters (2010) found evidence that knowledge that integrates a high amount of prior art from several different sectors (i.e., diversified knowledge) is likely to generate a high number of knowledge flows. Similarly, Nemet (2012) showed that for energy technologies the integration of technologically distant prior art (i.e., diversified knowledge) has a stronger positive effect on knowledge flows than the integration of technologically near prior art (i.e., specialized knowledge). In contrast to this view, there are studies which suggest that specialized knowledge is more likely to generate knowledge flows since “learning performance is greatest when the object of learning is related to what is already known” (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990, p. 131). “Local” – in the sense of technological near – learning may benefit from the cumulative character of knowledge within a technological trajectory (Dosi, 1982, 1997). Lettl et al. (2009, p. 246) argue that “specialization is [thus] positively associated with technological impact.” According to this line of argument, specialized knowledge, which is typically based on prior art from technologically near areas (Lazear, 2004; Lettl et al., 2009), can be expected to generate a higher amount of knowledge flows. In addition, this view is backed by empirical studies: Analyzing several technological fields, Nemet and Johnson (2012) found that the integration of technologically distant prior art is less important to knowledge flows than is the integration of technologically near prior art (i.e., specialized knowledge). Also, on a firm level, Gilsing et al. (2008) found evidence that the positive impact of integrating prior art from different technologies decreases with increasing technological distance. Responding to the two contradictory lines of argument, in this paper we offer a differentiated perspective on the effect of the degree of specialization of knowledge. As stated above, previous empirical studies have investigated the effect of the degree of specialization on the totality of knowledge flows without differentiating knowledge flows by the recipient technology. In such a pooled analysis, only an aggregated or average effect is visible, leveling out any specific mechanisms that govern knowledge flows depending on their direction. By contrast, we argue that the effect of the degree of specialization on subsequent knowledge flows is likely to vary depending on their direction. In the following, we develop two corresponding hypotheses, one for knowledge flows within the same technology and one for knowledge flows to other technologies, which aim at resolving the inconclusiveness in both theoretical reasoning and empirical findings in the literature. 130 We argue that the positive effect of specialization on knowledge flows is mostly relevant for technologies that are close to the technological domain in which the specialized knowledge originated. As discussed above, literature emphasized the “local” value of specialization (Dosi, 1982, 1997; Cohen and Levinthal, 1989). Also, Cantner and Graf (2004) show that for a high level of technological specialization, knowledge transfer increases across inventors in the same area yet decreases across different areas. Consequently, a high degree of specialization is likely to reduce the value of knowledge for distant technologies. In other words, specialized knowledge may particularly contribute to knowledge flows within the same technology, rather than knowledge flows across technologies. Conversely, we argue that the positive effect of diversified knowledge that combines prior art from several distant areas (i.e., “cumulative synthesis”) is especially relevant for knowledge flows across technologies. Combining knowledge from several distinct areas generally leads to innovations that impact a broad set of technologies (Usher, 1954; Arthur, 2009). By contrast, for knowledge flows within the same technology, the positive effect of diversified knowledge is weakened compared to specialized knowledge. Typically, successful inventors develop specialized capabilities, focusing on specific technological areas (Lettl et al., 2009). Sorenson et al. (2006) found evidence that knowledge is more easily transmittable across actors that have similar capabilities. As the degree to which actors differ in capabilities increases with their technological distance (Gilsing et al., 2008), the more technologically distant the integrated prior art, the less likely are knowledge flows within a technology. In summary, we hypothesize that the effect of specialized knowledge is more important for knowledge flows within the same technology, while the “cumulative synthesis” mechanism prevails for knowledge flows across technologies. This leads to the following two hypotheses: – H1a: Specialized knowledge is likely to generate more knowledge flows within the same technology than diversified knowledge. – H1b: Diversified knowledge is likely to generate more knowledge flows across technologies than specialized knowledge. 2.2 The effect of the degree of centrality of knowledge The second knowledge characteristic we focus on in this paper is the degree of centrality, which we define as the level at which knowledge is located in the product architecture. For this we introduce a new determinant in the discussion on knowledge flows. Strongly influenced by the work of Ulrich (1995) and Baldwin & Clark (2000), the product architecture approach conceptualizes technology as a complex system that can be decomposed into several subsystems and components in nested hierarchies. This concept has been found to be highly 131 relevant in diverse areas, such as industry structure (Fixson and Park, 2008), technological development (Murmann and Frenken, 2006; Winskel et al., 2013), organizational structure (Henderson and Clark, 1990) and firm performance (Ulrich, 1995). A central theme in the product architecture literature is that components or subsystems differ in their importance or centrality to the system (Tushman and Rosenkopf, 1992). The centrality of a component describes the degree to which the component is coupled to other components or subsystems of the technological system (Tushman and Murmann, 1998). While some components are described as “core,” with a high centrality, others are rather “peripheral,” with a low centrality (Clark, 1985; Henderson and Clark, 1990; Tushman and Rosenkopf, 1992).72 Core components are characterized by having many linkages to other components or subsystems (Tushman and Rosenkopf, 1992). Thus, a change in a core component will affect many functions of the technological system (Saviotti and Metcalfe, 1984; Murmann and Frenken, 2006). In contrast to core components, peripheral components have fewer linkages and affect fewer functions than core components (Tushman and Rosenkopf, 1992; Murmann and Frenken, 2006). Hence, “changes in core subsystems will have greater system-wide [i.e., within the same technological system] effects than changes in peripheral subsystems” (Tushman and Murmann, 1998, p. 17). Building on this argument, Murmann and Frenken (2006) postulate that inventions in core components of a technology may change its “dominant design”. Thus, new knowledge on core components is likely to have a substantial impact on the further development of the respective technology. Consequently, we argue that core knowledge is highly relevant for knowledge flows within technologies. Conversely, peripheral components are less connected to other components of a technological system. Thus, they can be disintegrated more easily and are typically designed in a modular way. Modularity aims “at defining a standardized set of interfaces among components” (Brusoni and Prencipe, 2001, p. 179) and thereby allows the component or subsystem to be employed in different technologies and to be produced by different manufacturers (Ulrich, 1995; Baldwin and Clark, 2000; Miozzo and Grimshaw, 2005). A modular design can accelerate innovation since it ensures that several research teams can work in parallel and that different design options can be tested (Ethiraj and Levinthal, 2004; Cabigiosu et al., 2013). Modularity ensures that a component can be transferred to different settings and different technologies (Baldwin and Clark, 2000), and thus knowledge on peripheral components 72 Note that although the literature sometimes imposes a binary dichotomy classifying components or subsystems as either core or periphery, the different product architecture levels should rather be understood as a continuum (Murmann and Frenken, 2006). Components and subsystems can be ranked according to the centrality of their product architecture level ranging from core to peripheral (cf. Section 3.2.2.2). For instance, Murmann & Frenken (2006) propose a ranking of components according to their pleiotropy (i.e., “the number of functions affected by this component,” page 941), defining components with a high pleiotropy as core and components with a low pleiotropy as peripheral. 132 can easily be used by inventors focusing on other technologies. Therefore, knowledge contained in modularly designed components is likely to have a high impact across different technologies. However, because a modular component is primarily characterized as being “weakly connected to elements in other units” (Baldwin and Clark, 2000, p. 63), core components that are, by definition, strongly connected to other components or subsystems of a certain technology (Tushman and Rosenkopf, 1992) are typically non-modular. Consequently, since peripheral components are typically designed in a modular way, as opposed to core components, we argue that peripheral knowledge is more relevant for knowledge flows across technologies than core knowledge. In sum, this reasoning leads to the following hypotheses: – H2a: Core knowledge is likely to generate more knowledge flows within the same technology than peripheral knowledge. – H2b: Peripheral knowledge is likely to generate more knowledge flows across technologies than core knowledge. 3. Data and methodology In order to test the hypotheses derived in Section 2, we regress knowledge flows within and across technologies on the degree of specialization and centrality. To this end, we analyze a patent data set of three types of batteries. Specifically, forward citations of a patent are used as proxies for knowledge flows, whereas backward citations indicate integrated prior art.73 Moreover, each patent is classified into one of four different product architecture levels to operationalize its centrality. The remainder of this section proceeds in two steps. First, section 3.1 “Data” discusses the use of patent citations as a proxy for knowledge flows (3.1.1) and derives the selection of our case example (batteries) (3.1.2), before data source, processing and handling are described (3.1.3 and 3.1.4). Second, section 3.2 “Methodology” introduces the dependent (3.2.1) and independent (3.2.2) variables, presents the regression specification and the estimation technique (3.2.3) and ends with a short overview of the sensitivity analyses (3.2.4). 3.1 Data 3.1.1 Measuring knowledge flows with patent data Patent data exhibits several positive characteristics that explain its wide acceptance among researchers investigating inventive activity and knowledge flows (Jaffe, 1986). By definition, patent data measures novel, non-obvious and useable technological enhancements (Dernis and Guellec, 2001; Barton, 73 Forward citations contain information by which subsequent patents the patent of interest is cited; backward citations contain information which prior patents are cited by the patent of interest. 133 2003). Moreover, comprehensive data on patents and their citations is publicly available, including detailed descriptions of technological characteristics and classification into technical domains (Popp et al., 2011). However, it should be noted that patent data is not without limitations: Not all inventions are patented, not all patents are equally important, and the propensity to patent varies across countries and firms (Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 2002). Patent citations are commonly used as a proxy for knowledge flows since they point to the prior art on which the patent is based and thus represent a “paper trail” useful for studying knowledge diffusion (Trajtenberg, 1990; Verspagen and De Loo, 1999; Schoenmakers and Duysters, 2010). Note that the use of patent citations as proxies for knowledge flows also has limitations. In particular, not all citations represent knowledge flows, since not only the inventor but also the patent examiner may add citations to a patent (Alcacer and Gittelman, 2006; Criscuolo and Verspagen, 2008).74 Nevertheless, patent citations are arguably the best available indicator for knowledge flows (Trajtenberg, 1990) and thus they are used in this study. 3.1.2 Case selection In this paper, knowledge flows within and across technologies are analyzed through the case example of battery technologies. Specifically, we examine patent data of lithium-ion, lead-acid and nickel batteries. These battery technologies are well suited to test our hypotheses from a theoretical, methodological and relevance perspective. First, all three technologies are comparable in their product architecture, while all three also present sufficient variation in terms of materials, main components and system design. Thus, employing these three battery technologies as a case example to investigate knowledge diffusion ensures that product architecture is structured in a similar way and thus facilitates one of the key analyses of this paper. Second, the choice of these three battery types results in a high quality and representative data sample as targeted patent classes exist for these technologies both in the International (IPC) and in the European Patent Classification (ECLA) scheme, firms involved in the battery value chain exhibit a high propensity to patent, and together these technologies cover about 80% of the total battery market (Battery University, 2009).75 Third, the understanding of knowledge diffusion across batteries is highly relevant from a practical perspective. These technologies are currently the subject of considerable attention because of public and private efforts to market electric vehicles and the emergence of grid-scale battery storage. Hence, understanding the mechanisms of 74 To control for a potential bias of citations added by the examiner, we included an additional regression specification as a sensitivity analysis that investigates only citations added by the inventor (cf. Appendix C). 75 Most firms active in battery development belong either to the chemical or to the electrical equipment industry. Firms in both industries exhibit an above-average propensity to patent (Arundel and Kabla, 1998). 134 knowledge creation in this area is of high importance for policy makers, researchers and practitioners (Tarascon, 2010; Battke et al., 2013). Fourth, the choice of batteries enables us to analyze the research question concerning the direction of knowledge flows on the levels of both the technology (i.e., batteries) and the sub-technology (i.e., lead-acid, lithium-ion, and nickel). This shift of research focus to a more detailed level compared to previous studies on knowledge flows (cf. Nemet and Johnson (2012)) has relevant theoretical implications, as the issue of (premature) lock-in of technologies and sub-technologies has been raised in the literature but has never been thoroughly analyzed (Hoppmann et al., 2013). The development of these three battery technologies can be roughly divided into three periods. Figure 2 displays the number of patents in each technology, indicating that in the beginning (1980-1985) the majority of patents were in the lead-acid battery area, while all three technologies were of roughly equal importance in the period from 1985 to 1995, and lithium-ion has generated most patenting activity in recent years. FIGURE 2: DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PATENTS PER YEAR AND BATTERY TECHNOLOGY (#) 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 1,000 100 10 10,000 NickelLithium-ionLead-acid 135 3.1.3 Data retrieval, testing and cleaning The patent data was retrieved from the Thomson Innovation database covering the most important patent offices worldwide. 76 Choosing this database ensured that besides the standard patent information, data on patent families, forward citations, backward citations, inventor / examiner citations, and Derwent’s Electrical and Chemical Patent Indexes Manual Codes was available. For the patent data retrieval, a search string combining patent classes with keywords was implemented in an iterative process to maximize data coverage and quality.77 While the pure reliance on keywords entails the risk of not having an exhaustive sample, the use of patent classes depends on the quality of the classification schemes. However, a combination of both, together with testing and adaptation of the search string, minimizes the risks of both approaches. Thus, to increase the data coverage and quality, tests for false positives and false negatives were implemented after each round of data retrieval, with the search string adapted in response to these quality checks.78 Additionally, the patent data set was cleaned to correct for self-citations and double counts within patent families. 79 Finally, a MATLAB-based matching algorithm linked the forward and backward citation information in citing and cited patents, thereby synthesizing the key knowledge diffusion metrics per patent. 3.1.4 Time period The data was retrieved at the end of 2012, yet we confined the data sets to the period 1980 to 2010 to ensure consistent data coverage and quality.80 To compare earlier and later patents on fair means, we truncated both forward and backward citations after 10 years in order to ensure that each patent has an equal chance of citing and being cited. As a result, the analyzed patents are limited to the period 1990 to 2000, while their backward and forward citations cover the period 1980 to 2010. The final data set comprises 22,548 patents with 69,222 backward and 105,750 forward citations. Additionally, as other studies on knowledge flows impose a 76 The Thomson Innovation database covers all major patent offices worldwide (including the Asia-Pacific Region) and includes translated and searchable patent abstracts. 77 A keyword-based search strategy utilizes Boolean operators to combine words describing the technology in question (cf. Nemet (2009)), while classification-based strategies use classification schemes provided by patent authorities (cf. Popp (2006)). 78 The iterative process was repeated until the shares of false positive and false negatives were at very low levels (6% and 7% respectively) (Mogoutov and Kahane, 2007; Raffo and Lhuillery, 2009). 79 Self-citations within patent families need to be corrected as they do not represent knowledge flows. In the following, one “patent” represents one “patent family,” as patents that have the same information, yet were filed in different patent offices (i.e., different patents in one patent family) were combined. 80 While before 1980 the data coverage and quality of some patent offices is at best unclear, data after 2010 is likely to be incomplete due to the time necessary to file and process patents. 136 5-year citation window in their data sets, we also include analysis on a 5-year citation window data set as a sensitivity analysis in Appendix C resulting in a set of 42,619 patents. 81 3.2 Methodology To test our hypotheses, we regress knowledge flows (measured as the count of a patent’s forward citations) on the degree of specialization of knowledge (measured as the count of a patent’s backward citations) and on the centrality of the knowledge (identified by the product architecture level). The following section provides an overview of the variables, regression technique and sensitivity analyses employed in the analysis. Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics of the variables, while the correlation matrix is given in Appendix B. 3.2.1 Dependent variable: Knowledge flows As we hypothesize that drivers of knowledge flows differ depending on their direction (cf. Section 2), we differentiate the knowledge flows by the technological distance of the recipient technology. To this end, we run three independent regressions, one for each kind of knowledge flow, employing forward citations as a proxy (cf. Section 3.1). First, Intra-technology knowledge flows are measured as the count of forward citations within the same battery technology (e.g., a lead-acid patent cited by another lead-acid patent). Second, Inter-technology knowledge flows are measured as the count of forward citations to other battery technologies (e.g., a lead-acid patent cited by a lithium-ion patent). Third, External knowledge flows are measured as the count of forward citations to non-battery patents (e.g., a lead-acid patent cited by an automotive patent). Figure 3 illustratively depicts the three different kinds of knowledge flows. 81 This data set comprises 101,433 backward and 106,548 forward citations in the period of 1985 to 2005. 137 FIGURE 3: ILLUSTRATION OF INTRA-, INTER-TECHNOLOGY, AND EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE FLOWS 3.2.2 Independent variables 3.2.2.1 Degree of specialization of knowledge (Hypotheses 1a/b) In order to test Hypotheses 1a/b on knowledge flows of specialized and diversified knowledge, i.e., on the impact of integrating prior art from technologically distant and near areas, three variables are included in our regression: Technologically near prior art, Technologically related prior art, and Technologically distant prior art. These variables operationalize the amount and origin of prior art that is integrated into the new knowledge, and thus indicate the degree of specialization. To construct these prior art variables, a patent’s backward citations are distinguished depending on the technological distance of the patent citing and the cited prior art: Technologically near prior art is measured as the count of backward citations to the same battery technology (e.g., a lead-acid patent citing another lead-acid patent). Technologically related prior art is measured as the count of backward citations to other battery technologies (e.g., a lead-acid patent citing a lithium-ion patent). Technologically distant prior art is measured as the count of backward citations to non-battery technologies (e.g., a lead-acid patent citing an automotive patent). All technologies Batteries Lead-acid Lithium-ion Nickel Patent of interest Citing patentP C P C Intra-technology knowledge flows P C Inter-technology knowledge flows P C External knowledge flows 138 3.2.2.2 Degree of centrality of knowledge (Hypotheses 2a/b) In order to test Hypotheses 2a/b on knowledge flows of core and peripheral knowledge, i.e., on the impact of the degree of centrality of knowledge, four binary variables (Materials, Principal components, Cell system, Additional components) are included in the regression indicating the product architecture level of the patent. 82 The four different product architecture levels are defined based on the technological content the patent focuses on. The Materials category comprises patents that protect intellectual property on production, composition and use of chemical elements or compounds (e.g., “Nickel or cobalt alloys,” “inorganic compounds,” or “complex oxides”). The Principal components category includes patents protecting knowledge on the main components of batteries, such as electrodes, separators, or electrolytes. The Cell system category covers intellectual property on the design and layout of the battery cell (e.g., “alkaline cells,” “secondary battery cells”). The Additional components category includes patents focusing on non-core areas of a battery system, e.g., battery chargers, casing, measurement, and cooling. These four product architecture levels were ordered along their centrality (cf. Section 2.2). To this end, a series of twelve formal and informal expert interviews was conducted. In these interviews, we asked the experts to describe i) which of the four product architecture levels has the highest impact on the choice and design of the other levels (Fixson and Park, 2008; MacCormack et al., 2012), and ii) which one most affects the service characteristics of the entire system (Murmann and Frenken, 2006).83 As a result, Materials was ranked highest in terms of centrality to the system, followed by Principal components, Cells system, and Additional components with lowest centrality. The choice of a battery Material strongly affects the design of the Principal components (e.g., electrodes) which, in turn, determine the layout of the Cell system. Additional components have the smallest effect on both the overall service characteristics of a battery and on the remaining product architecture levels. 84 In order to classify the patents along the four different product architecture levels, information codified in the Derwent Electrical and Chemical Patents Index (EPI and CPI) Manual Codes was used. Compared to standard patent classes (e.g., the International Patent Classification (IPC)), the Manuel Codes provide more detailed information on the central inventive aspects of a patent as well as on its 82 As some patents were not classified into one product architecture level (for example, they had the identical number of Manual Codes from two product architecture levels), all four product architecture levels can be simultaneously included in the regression. 83 The experts interviewed included both practitioners from battery manufacturers as well as academics with a research focus on batteries. 84 Specifically, materials are the most important factor defining the main service characteristics such as cycle life time and energy density (Dunn et al., 2011). Given a specific material (e.g., lithium-ion), the design and shape of the Principal components can be adapted to increase power rating or discharge duration. Subsequently, an optimization of the Cell system can slightly improve the service characteristics as, for instance, waste heat production or energy density. Finally, Additional components (e.g., cooling or measurement) primarily impact secondary service characteristics such as maintenance or power losses during operation. From a cost and performance perspective, operation and maintenance costs are of minor importance compared to energy density or cycle frequency (Kaldellis et al., 2009; Battke et al., 2013). 139 commercial application. Using these Manual Codes, a patent was assigned to a product architecture level in two steps. First, two researchers independently classified 433 Manual Codes (covering 85% of all Manual Codes entries in our data sample) into the four different architecture levels. For instance, the manual code “inorganic compounds” was assigned to the Materials level, while “graphite electrodes” was assigned to Principal components. Second, a patent was classified into one product architecture level if at least 50% of its Manual Codes fell into the respective level (“Assignment method: Maximum”). 85 The reasoning behind the assignment method is that a patent is either completely a Material or completely a Principal component patent, depending on what the majority of its Manual Codes belong to. Additionally, in an alternative assignment method, a patent was classified into a product architecture level if at least one manual code fell into the respective level (“Assignment method: Multiple”). The assumption behind this assignment method is that a patent can be, for instance, both Material and a Principal component patent. This approach was implemented as a sensitivity analysis in Appendix C. 3.2.2.3 Controls Following earlier work on knowledge flows and patent citations (Verspagen and De Loo, 1999; Kim and Marschke, 2004; Lanjouw and Schankerman, 2004; Nemet, 2012; Nemet and Johnson, 2012), seven control variables are included in the regression. These variables, as well as their expected effect on knowledge flows, are described below. The binary variables Lead-acid battery, Lithium-ion battery, and Nickel battery identify the respective battery technology of the patent. As one type of battery technology might be inherently more dynamic than another type, these three variables control for the technological characteristics (Nelson and Wolff, 1997; Nelson, 2003). 86 The binary variable Triadic patent indicates whether a patent has been filed in each of the United States, Europe and Japan. Triadic patents are a typical measure to control for the value of patents and thus are widely used in research investigating patent information (Grupp, 1998; van Pottelsberghe et al., 2001; Dechezleprêtre et al., 2013). A positive effect of Triadic patent on knowledge flows is expected since only for their most vauable patents are firms likely to bear the additional costs and effort of filing a patent multiple times. The Priority date of the patent family indicates the earliest filing date of a patent in the family (Popp et al., 2011). Although we grant each patent the same citation possibility by truncating citations after 10 years (cf. Section 3.2.3), some time periods might exhibit a higher citation propensity per patent than other time periods, resulting in higher knowledge flows. The inclusion of the Priority date attempts to control for this aspect. 85 Employing a factor analysis, we controlled for the correlation between the Manual Codes in order to avoid a relative advantage for product architecture levels that exhibit a higher number of Manual Codes (Field, 2013). 86 As our data set consists solely of patents classified as either lead-acid, lithium-ion, or nickel, the regression would be over-identified if all three variables were included. Thus, the variable nickel battery is excluded in the set of independent variables, i.e., the effects of lead-acid and lithium-ion must be interpreted as effects in comparison to nickel batteries, which are the baseline technology in the regressions. 140 Moreover, we include the quadratic term Priority date squared to control for non-linear effects. 87 As descriptive statistics of our data sets show that the propensity per patent to generate knowledge flows peaks in 1994, a positive effect on knowledge flows of Priority date and a negative one of Priority date squared is expected. Finally, we include the Mean backward citation lag defined as the time difference between the priority date of the citing and the cited patents.88 This variable was included since an invention might need time to become well known, and thus the likelihood to generate knowledge flows over time increases (Criscuolo and Verspagen, 2008). 3.2.3 Regression model In order to explain the determinants of the direction of knowledge flows, we regress knowledge flows (measured as the count of a patent’s forward citations) on the degree of specialization (measured as the count of a patent’s backward citations) and centrality of knowledge (identified by the product architecture level). Our regression model can be described by the following specification: Since the dependent variable knowledge flows can be described as “count data” approximated by the number of forward citations, we employ the negative binomial regression technique (cf. Appendix A). Finally, we use heteroscedasticity- and autocorrelation-robust standard errors across all specifications and model the over-dispersion of the dependent variable as a function of its mean as proposed by Long and Freese (2006). 3.2.4 Sensitivity analyses Besides the main regression model, we display four additional regression specifications as sensitivity analyses in Appendix C. These sensitivity analyses aim to control for possible alternatives in the analysis process and can be structured along three areas. First, changing the data to be analyzed, specification (2) employs a data set covering patents from 1985 to 2005 using a 5-year citation buffer window, while specification (3) investigates only citations that were added by the inventor (cf. Section 3.1.1). Second, changing the way variables are constructed, specification (4) uses an alternative 87 An alternative way to control for this effect would be to include the grant year of a patent instead of the year of the priority date. However, Nemet & Johnson (2012) observe no difference in the results of regressions with grant year versus application year (year of the priority date). 88 In case a patent had no backward citations a Mean backward citation lag of zero was used. In order to test for the effects of alternatives approaches we i) replaced the missing values with the average value of the Mean backward citation lag in the data set, ii) excluded patents with no backward citations from all regressions, and iii) excluded the variable Mean backward citation lag from all regressions. All four approaches resulted in almost identical results in terms of ranking and signs of the variables of interest.

Results In this section, we describe the effects of the degree of specialization (4.1) and centrality of knowledge (4.2) on knowledge flows within and across technologies. Table 2 displays the results of the three main regression specifications on Intra-, Inter-technology and External knowledge flows. 89 Moreover, the last column presents the results of a pooled regression on all knowledge flows of a patent in order to contrast these values with the results of the regressions in which the knowledge flows are differentiated by the recipient technology. We will compare both approaches in Section 5. In general, the significance levels of the variables of interest and controls are relatively high, with the majority of coefficients significant at a 1% level. Moreover, the null hypothesis that all coefficients are equal to zero can be rejected at any conventional significance level. The explanatory power of the independent variables is very high, with a mean prediction error below 1% (cf. Appendix A, Figure A.1). 4.1 The degree of specialization of knowledge In section 2.1, we argued that specialized knowledge is likely to generate more knowledge flows to the same technology than diversified knowledge (Hypothesis 1a); and conversely that diversified knowledge is likely to generate more knowledge flows across technologies than specialized knowledge (Hypothesis 1b). The regression results displayed in Table 2 and in Appendix C support both hypotheses. For knowledge flows within the same technology (Intra-technology), Technologically near prior art indicating specialized knowledge is most important, while for Inter-technology knowledge flows, Technologically related prior art has the highest coefficient. Finally, for External knowledge flows, Technologically distant prior art indicating diversified knowledge has the strongest impact, whereas Technologically near prior art even has a negative effect on knowledge flows across technologies. 89 As with any non-linear model, the interpretation of coefficients of a negative binomial regression is not straightforward, as the effect of a change in one variable depends on the values of all variables in the model. For instance, a change of δ in the variable k, holding all other variables constant at their mean, changes the expected count by the factor of (Long and Freese, 2006). Yet in general, a positive coefficient also indicates a positive effect on the independent variable, and the greater the coefficient, the stronger is this effect. 143 TABLE 2: RESULTS OF REGRESSIONS ON KNOWLEDGE FLOWS DIRECTION Dependent variable Intra- technology knowledge flows Inter- technology knowledge flows External knowledge flows All knowledge flows Degree of specialization of knowledge (Hyp. 1a/b) Diversified knowledge Techn. distant prior art 0.006** 0.025** 0.142*** 0.043*** Techn. related prior art 0.042 0.467*** 0.066 0.088*** Specialized knowledge Techn. near prior art 0.094*** 0.006 -0.031*** 0.053*** Degree of centrality of knowledge (Hyp. 2a/b) Core Knowledge Materials 0.247*** -0.429*** -0.061 0.120** Principal components 0.113*** -0.247*** -0.736*** -0.051* Cell system 0.065** -0.302*** -0.866*** -0.067* Peripheral knowledge Additional components -0.116** 0.643*** 1.297*** 0.585*** Controls Battery type: Lithium-ion 1.123*** -1.244*** -0.786*** 0.499*** Battery type: Lead-acid -0.067 -0.485*** -0.938*** -0.398*** Triadic patent 0.701*** 0.969*** 0.997*** 0.799*** Priority date 0.151*** 0.251*** 0.093** 0.146*** Priority date squared -0.013*** -0.020*** -0.006* -0.012*** Mean backward citation lag 0.094*** 0.187*** 0.221*** 0.145*** Constant -0.699*** -2.543*** -0.637*** -0.095 Overdispersion (ln α) 0.228*** 1.424*** 1.921*** 0.261*** Number of observations (patents) 22548 22548 22548 22548 Log-Likelihood -45461 -8163 -20459 -52775 Nagelkerke Pseudo-R² 0.31 0.17 0.18 0.31 10-year citation window data set; Negative binomial regression model with heteroscedasticity- and autocorrelation- robust standard errors; * p<0.1; ** p<0.05; *** p <0.01 Figure 4 depicts the ranking of the prior art variables across the three regressions. It clearly shows that the differentiation by the recipient technology of the knowledge flow changes the relative importance of the prior art variables. The shaded fields indicating the strongest effect within each regression change from bottom left (Intra-technology knowledge flows) toward upper right (External knowledge flows). 144 In the pooled regression on the total number of knowledge flows (Table 2, last column), however, these differentiated effects cannot be observed. Here, all prior art variables have a highly significant positive effect on knowledge flows, with the coefficients of specialized and diversified knowledge come in second and third place, respectively. As Appendix C displays, the presented results are robust to changes in the time period analyzed (1985 to 2005, Specification 2), to changes in the origin of the citation information (only inventor citations, Specification 3), to changes in the estimation technique (zero-inflated negative binomial, Specification 4), and to changes in the assignment method of patents to product architecture levels (multiple assignment, Specification 5). Rather, the relative ranking of the three prior art variables is even more pronounced in most sensitivity analyses than in the main regression specification.

In particular, we hypothesized that core knowledge on a more central product architecture level is more likely to be transferred within the same technology (Hypothesis 2a), but less likely to be transferred across technologies compared to peripheral knowledge on a less central product architecture level (Hypothesis 2b). While our regression results in Table 2 and in Appendix C represent support for Hypothesis 2a, the evidence for Hypothesis 2b is less clear. For Intra-technology knowledge flows, Materials, Principal components and Cell system significantly increase the expected number of knowledge flows, while Additional components has a significant negative effect – in line with Hypothesis 2a, which expects a relatively higher number of knowledge flows within the same technology for core knowledge. For Inter-technology knowledge flows, the coefficients of Materials, Principal components, and Cell system turn significantly negative, whereas Additional components has a positive effect. For External knowledge flows, the effects are even more pronounced. The negative impact of Principal components and Cell system rises, while in addition the positive effect of Additional components gains strength. However, the coefficient of Materials turns insignificant in this regression and thus has a higher effect than Principal components and Cell systems. 90 While the strong positive effect of Additional components as an indicator for peripheral knowledge on External knowledge flows is in line with Hypothesis 2b, the middle ranking of Materials as an indicator of core knowledge was not expected, generating mixed evidence for this hypothesis.. Figure 5, which shows the ranking of the product architecture level variables graphically, depicts the effect of the degree of centrality of knowledge. The relative position in the ranking of the product architecture variables of Principal components and Cell system falls the more distant the recipient technology of the knowledge flows. By contrast, the relative position of Additional components – the product architecture level with the lowest centrality indicating peripheral knowledge – rises. The only exception to this rule is the u-shaped curve of the Materials coefficient and its ranking, which falls from Intra- to Inter-technology knowledge flows, yet turns insignificant in the regression on External knowledge flows. One potential explanation for this phenomenon is that Materials stands out from the other three architecture levels. It is the most central architecture level but at the same time also carries a general purpose characteristic (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995; Lipsey et al., 1998). New knowledge on Materials is potentially relevant for all technologies that use this or a related material, independently 90 The hypothesis that the coefficient of Materials is equal to the coefficient of Principal components can be rejected on a 0.1% significance level. 146 of the distance between the technologies. For instance, for our sample, knowledge that was developed in the context of lithium-ion batteries might impact areas as distant as, for instance, lithium-based, high-temperature lubricants or heat transfer technologies (Tarascon, 2010). Moreover, the high centrality of Materials might also be specific to battery technologies. While in the context of batteries, the choice of the Materials strongly impacts other product architecture levels (cf. section 3.2.2.2), this might be different for the case of other technologies (e.g., wind turbines (Hameed et al., 2010)). However, once again, the pooled regression on the total number of knowledge flows would not have been able to identify these effects. In the pooled regression, Materials and Additional components have a significant positive effect, while Principal components and Cell system significantly reduce the expected number of knowledge flows. Hence, with regard to the centrality of product architecture level, a u-shaped pattern evolves from the pooled regression. The pattern depicted in Figure 5 is robust across all sensitivity analyses (Appendix C). Changing the analyzed time period to 1985 to 2005 (Specification 2), including only inventor citations (Specification 3), employing a zero-inflated negative binomial regression (Specification 4), and changing the assignment method of patents to product architecture levels (Specification 5) does not create additional conflicting evidence. In all three regression models (as well as in the sensitivity analyses shown in Appendix C) the control variables are almost all highly significant and the signs of their coefficients are in line with previous literature on knowledge diffusion (cf. 3.2.2.3). 147 FIGURE 5: RANKING OF REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS OF DEGREE OF CENTRALITY VARIABLES (SPECIFICATION 1) 5. Discussion In this section we first highlight the importance of differentiating knowledge flows by their direction (5.1) and then discuss implications for the literature on technological evolution (5.2) as well as for policy makers (5.3), before addressing limitations and future research (5.4). 5.1 On the importance of differentiating knowledge flows by their direction The main purpose of this paper is to improve the understanding of the determinants of knowledge diffusion within and across technologies. While previous studies on knowledge diffusion investigated only effects on the totality of knowledge flows in a pooled analysis, the present contribution introduces a differentiated perspective on the direction of knowledge flows. This differentiated perspective indicates that different characteristics of knowledge do indeed increase the probability of this knowledge flowing within or across technologies. In particular, the expected effects derived from the literature on specialization (Cantner and Graf, 2004; Lettl et al., 2009), cumulative synthesis (Gilfillan, 1935; Nelson and Winter, 1982; Fleming, 2001; Arthur, 2009), core DEGREE OF CENTRALITY OF KNOWLEDGE -0.116** 0.065** 0.113*** 0.247*** Materials Principal components Additional components Cell system 0.643*** 1.297*** -0.247*** -0.061-0.429*** -0.302*** -0.736*** -0.866*** a Color scale indicates relative ranking of coefficients within each regression (Dark = highest effect, white = lowest effect; 2nd and 3rd highest effects are colored in grey) High Low Core knowledge Peripheral knowledge EFFECT ON KNOWLEDGE FLOWS a Technological distance of recipient technologyNear Far Intra-technology knowledge flows Inter-technology knowledge flows External knowledge flowsHyp2b: Increasing effectsHyp2a: Increasing effects 148 components (Tushman and Rosenkopf, 1992; Murmann and Frenken, 2006), and modularity (Ulrich, 1995; Baldwin and Clark, 2000) became observable in the differentiated perspective. Importantly, the pooled regression we performed on the totality of knowledge flows was not able to identify these effects, since any specific mechanisms that govern knowledge flows depending on their direction were leveled out. With our differentiated analysis we thereby show that the theoretical concepts used to derive the hypotheses on the determinants of knowledge flows are not contradictory but complement each other when knowledge flows are differentiated by their direction. These findings may also help to explain the inconsistent empirical evidence for the impact of degree of specialization of knowledge in previous research. As discussed in Section 2.1, our findings suggest that this ambiguity is due to the fact that previous studies do not differentiate the knowledge flows by their direction. The presented analysis shows that both specialized and diversified knowledge may indeed have a stronger effect on knowledge flows, depending on whether one looks at knowledge flows within or across technologies. Based on our findings, we would expect studies that investigate technological fields with a higher share of intra-technology knowledge flows to find a stronger effect of specialized knowledge. By contrast, we would expect analyses of technological fields that are more strongly characterized by inter-technology knowledge flows (e.g., energy technologies (Nemet, 2012)) to show a stronger effect of diversified knowledge. Moreover, the notion that different causal mechanisms may determine the direction of knowledge flows is also of immediate relevance for adjacent research areas. This includes, for instance, the literature on recombinant search (Fleming, 2001; Rosenkopf and Nerkar, 2001; Schilling and Green, 2011), which investigates the origin of high-value innovations from a management perspective, focusing on the process of combining knowledge from different areas. 5.2 Implications for the literature on technological evolution On a more general level, several implications for the literature on technological evolution can be derived from the analysis presented in this paper. In particular, the understanding of what kind of knowledge is likely to advance existing technologies along their established trajectories and what kind of knowledge has the potential to cross-fertilize other technologies, thereby increasing technological variety, is important for technological evolution in general and the “cumulative synthesis” process in particular. Thus, in this section, we relate our results to the discussion of technological trajectories and variety. This paper presented evidence that specialized knowledge is more likely to be transferred within the same technology than diversified knowledge, i.e., specialization leads to more specialization. This supports the notion that technological learning is “local” (i.e., inventions are likely to take place in 149 close neighborhoods of existing technologies) and cumulative (i.e., building upon past knowledge) (Dosi, 1997). This in turn underlines the self-reinforcing character of technological specialization described by Dosi (1982, p. 153) in that “once a path has been selected and established, it shows a momentum of its own,” thereby strengthening existing technological trajectories (Dosi, 1997; Verspagen, 2007). Moreover, our analysis supports the notion that core knowledge is transferred predominately to the same technology. As a dominant design of a technology is defined by the choice of its core components (Murmann and Frenken, 2006), this finding shows one way in which core knowledge strengthens the current dominant design of a technology. Thus, core knowledge is also likely to advance a technology along its current technological trajectory. In contrast to specialized and core knowledge, diversified and peripheral knowledge do not have the tendency to reinforce existing technological trajectories. Our results indicate that diversified knowledge is more likely to be transferred across technologies than specialized knowledge. In other words, a larger set of different technologies is likely to benefit from the inter-technology spillovers generated by diversified knowledge. The same reasoning also holds for peripheral knowledge, which is likely to generate knowledge flows across technologies as well. Research and development efforts on entire technological systems including peripheral and modular components will benefit a broader set of technologies, potentially contributing to the creation of new technological trajectories. As the degree to which knowledge impacts several different technological areas (i.e., the generality of knowledge) is a measure of its overall value to the economy (Popp and Newell, 2012), the positive effect of diversified and peripheral knowledge is underlined. In summary, with respect to the development of technologies, diversified and peripheral knowledge have the potential to cross-fertilize different technologies, as knowledge spillovers increase technological variety. The advancement of existing technologies along their established trajectories bears up- and downsides (Unruh, 2002; van den Bergh, 2008; Kalkuhl et al., 2012): In the short run, the focus on specialized and core knowledge advancing existing technologies along their trajectories can result in increased efficiency because of economies of scale, standardization, and learning-by-doing and learning–by- using. However, in the long run, the value of diversified and peripheral knowledge increasing technological variety becomes apparent: A higher technological variety results in a higher endogenous learning potential between technologies and a potentially more resilient economic system, an important aim of policy making (Stirling, 2007; van den Bergh, 2008; van der Vooren et al., 2012). 91 Hence, the understanding of what kind of knowledge benefits existing technologies and what kind of 91 Moreover, the development of technologies along established trajectories is typically based on incremental innovations (Verspagen, 2007), while radical innovations with a high innovative potential for the entire economy often incorporate knowledge from distinct technologies (Schoenmakers and Duysters, 2010), which supports the overall relevance of diversified knowledge. 150 knowledge has the potential to increase technological variety has important implications for policy makers. 5.3 Practical considerations If policy makers want to support research efforts on selected technologies or their deployment, they need to be aware that the consequences for the evolution of technologies differ depending on the kinds of knowledge that are created. When policy support focuses mostly on core parts of a technology, it runs the risk of reducing technological variety in the long-term, since core knowledge particularly benefits the same technology and increases the risk of locking-in this technology. Conversely, the risk of reducing technological variety is lower for support schemes that foster the development of peripheral or diversified knowledge (e.g., through support of systemic solutions and interdisciplinary research teams), as these two are more likely to generate inter-technology spillovers. However, supporting peripheral and diversified knowledge is less likely to accelerate the technological development of one specific technology than core and specialized knowledge. As a consequence, if policy makers want to foster innovation for core parts of technologies while maintaining technological variety, they should consider supporting several alternative technologies in parallel and/or complement the support of core and specialized components by advancing policies that foster diversified and peripheral knowledge to reduce the risk of a technological lock-in. Furthermore, our analyses highlighted that a detailed look at competing technologies within one technological field (in our case, several distinct battery technologies) can be highly insightful. From a practical point of view, the focus on this level can be relevant for policy makers who aim to maintain technological diversity not only on a higher level (e.g., energy storage technologies) but also on the level of specific technologies. A policy strategy that avoids a lock-in into a higher technological level (e.g., tailored feed-in tariffs for several electricity-generating technologies) may result in a lock-out of competing technologies on a lower level (e.g., solar thin film) (Hoppmann et al., 2013). Our analysis confirms that this risk of a premature lock-in through deployment policies also exists on the level of single technologies because of the limited amount of inter-technology knowledge flows for core and specialized knowledge. This is related to a recent discussion on the specificity level of technology support policies (Azar and Sandén, 2011). Finally, the analysis presented in this paper may be relevant for technology forecasting models. These models are at the center of major practical and scientific efforts such as integrated assessment models produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Gillingham et al., 2008; IPCC, 2014). Typically, these models employ the concept of learning curves to incorporate technical change and innovation, i.e., they forecast the cost-performance ratio of specific technologies as a function of the 151 installed capacity (Löschel, 2002). However, in light of the results of the present paper, especially with respect to the knowledge flows across technologies that result from diversified and peripheral knowledge, these models might have to be adapted to reflect inter-technology learning effects. 5.4 Limitations and future research This paper is of course not without limitations, which indicate potential avenues for future research. First, a main assumption of this paper is that patents measure knowledge and citations measure knowledge flows, although the limitations of patent data are well known in literature (cf. Section 3.1.1, and Trajtenberg (1990), Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2002), Alcacer and Gittelman (2006)). Consequently, future research should try to validate the findings of this paper employing different proxies for knowledge and knowledge flows. Second, while we introduced centrality of knowledge as a novel explanatory factor in the literature on technological knowledge diffusion, additional determinants of the direction of knowledge flows can further improve our understanding of this topic. For instance, several contributions have emphasized the relevance of firm-level or spatial factors for knowledge diffusion (Jaffe, 1986, 1993; Audretsch and Feldman, 1996). Incorporating such information in a study on the direction of knowledge flows is likely to increase the overall explanatory power of the analysis while mitigating potential biases in the results from unobserved factors. Finally, while batteries exhibit several characteristics that make them a well suited research case for the analysis of knowledge flows (cf. section 3.1.2), the focus on such a specific group of technologies limits the generalizability of this paper. Subsequent research should therefore replicate the analysis using different data samples that could potentially cover various technologies or entire technological fields, especially those relevant to policy making (e.g., energy, climate, nutrition or healthcare). 6. Conclusion The primary purpose of this paper is to improve the understanding of technological knowledge flows. By introducing a differentiated perspective on their direction, we analyzed which characteristics of knowledge (i.e., specialized or diversified knowledge, core or peripheral knowledge) increase the likelihood of generating knowledge flows within or across technologies. Using the literature on innovation and technical change, as well as the literature on product architecture, we developed four hypotheses on the propensity to generate knowledge flows within and across technologies. In this way, we bridged the two hitherto distinct literature streams on knowledge diffusion and product architecture. The hypotheses were tested employing a comprehensive set of patents on battery technologies. The analysis showed that specialized and core knowledge is more likely to flow within the same technology, yet less likely to flow across technologies compared to diversified and peripheral knowledge. Our findings help resolve inconclusive evidence of previous empirical studies on the 152 impact of specialized vs. diversified knowledge on subsequent inventions. On a more abstract level, our findings indicate a self-reinforcing character of specialization and research on core parts of a technology that is likely to reduce longer-term technological variety. Innovation-oriented policy should consider these findings when fostering the development of specific technologies while trying to avoid a technological lock-in. 153 Appendix Appendix A: Notes on estimation technique As the dependent variable, knowledge flows, is measured by the number of forward citations, i.e., count data, we employ the negative binomial regression technique (cf. Section 3.2.3). Alternative techniques for regressions on count data are the Poisson, the zero-inflated negative binomial, and the zero-inflated Poisson regression technique. Although all four regression approaches are Maximum Likelihood estimators, there are some important differences that guide the choice among them. The Poisson distribution assumes a variance equal to the mean of the data, whereas the negative binomial regression technique relaxes this assumption. As the variances of the three dependent variables (Intra-, Inter-technology and External knowledge flows) exceed their means by far, the data can be described as over-dispersed, supporting the choice of the negative binomial model instead of the Poisson model. 92 In case the dependent variable exhibits a high number of zeros, zero-inflated models can be used. These models allow for two distinct processes to generate the zeros when fitting the observed data and thereby increase the probability of zero counts. A test proposed by Vuong (1989) can be used to compare the fit of the standard negative binomial model and the zero-inflated negative binomial model. This test shows mixed results: For the regression on Intra-technology knowledge flows it supports the choice of the standard negative binomial model, while for the regressions on Inter- technology and External knowledge flows it supports the zero-inflated model. Consequently, we incorporate the zero-inflated negative binomial model as a sensitivity analysis in the results. 93 Plotting the difference of the predicted and the observed number of knowledge flows shows evidence supporting the choice of the negative binomial and the zero-inflated negative binomial model. Figure A.1 shows that negative binomial models fit the observed data far better than the Poisson models. 92 The Poisson distribution assumes a variance equal to the mean (equi-dispersion), whereas the negative binomial distributions allow for over-dispersion through the incorporation of the α parameter (Long and Freese, 2006). Tests for the significance of the α parameter reject the null hypothesis of equi-dispersion at a 0.1% significant level, strongly supporting the choice of the negative binomial regression. 93 Zero-inflated models need a second set of explanatory variables to inflate the probability of a zero (Long and Freese, 2006). To this end, we use the binary variable Granted which indicates the legal status of a patent.

Schmidt*a,b, Benedikt Battkea, David Grosspietscha, Volker H. Hoffmanna a Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich), Department of Management, Technology, and Economics, Chair of Sustainability and Technology, Weinbergstrasse 56/58, CH- 8092 Zurich, Switzerland; b Stanford University, Precourt Energy Efficiency Center, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, California 94305, USA 166 Abstract The role of deployment policies that aim to foster technological change has grown considerably, especially in the fields of energy and climate. However, recent research has shown that the adoption of deployment policies risks locking in the technology that is most cost-effective at the point of policy introduction, but may be inefficient in the long term. The present paper strives to offer advice to policy makers on how deployment policies can be designed so as to avoid such premature technology lock-in. While previous studies focused on the relationship between lock-in and the technology-specificity of deployment policies, this paper introduces a new factor: the existence of multiple applications for a technology. We argue that this factor is highly relevant for technological lock-in and should be considered by policy makers. To support our argument, we simulate the competition among four stationary battery technologies across energy system applications in an actor-based model. This simulation shows that the degree of competition among technologies differs strongly across applications, which corresponds with a highly varying lock-in risk. Hence, selecting applications in deployment policies corresponds to selecting technologies. We discuss the implications of these results for policy makers and for the academic debate on technological lock-in. Based on the notion that policies can have different technology-specificity levels, we develop the idea of the application- specificity of policies and provide examples of currently enacted deployment policies that vary in terms of their technology and application specificity. Highlights  Relates the lock-in debate to literature on multiple applications of technologies  Suggests how multiple applications can influence the policy effects on lock-in  Develops a methodology to assess the risk of a lock-in across applications  Presents evidence on a strong variation of the lock-in risk across applications  Discusses the implications and develops idea of a policy’s application-specificity Keywords technological diversity, path dependency, technology-specific policy, multi-purpose technology, techno-economic model, energy storage and batteries 167 1. Introduction Technological change is an important lever to address societal challenges such as climate change and energy security. Especially in the fields of energy and climate, the number of deployment policies aiming at technological change has strongly increased in recent years. Deployment policy instruments – such as standards, taxes, cap-and-trade systems, and fixed-price payment agreements – intervene in markets, changing their selection incentives, thereby aiming to diffuse technologies that have not yet been adopted on a large scale because of externalities, higher costs or increased technological uncertainty. However, they also frequently aim to induce technological learning and innovation (del Río González, 2009). While it is relatively clear that stringent deployment policies spur the diffusion of technologies, less research has been conducted analyzing their effect on innovation (Hoppmann et al., 2013). One emerging debate related to the innovative effect of deployment policies centers on the role of those policies in technological lock-in (Safarzynska and van den Bergh, 2010; Azar and Sandén, 2011). While deployment policies often aim to overcome existing lock-ins (e.g., the energy sector’s lock-in into greenhouse gas-intensive technologies), a question put forward in that debate is whether these policies create new lock-ins. Technological lock-in can be understood as a persistent state in which an economy is “trapped” in a specific technology (Unruh, 2000). It corresponds to the lock-out of technologies which might turn out to be superior in the long term consequently resulting in long-term inefficiencies (del Río González, 2008; Azar and Sandén, 2011). In order to balance short-term and long-term perspectives and avoid major inefficiencies, policy makers should consider technological lock-in when enacting deployment policies (van den Bergh, 2008). However, the best way to avoid technological lock-in is still debated in the literature. In the past, the academic debate mainly centered on the question of whether policies should be technology-neutral or technology-specific. However, recently the debate was taken to the next level by Azar and Sanden (2011), who argue that the dichotomy between technology-neutral and technology-specific policies does not truly exist. Rather, policies can be specific (or neutral) only on a certain technological hierarchy level: while a policy can be “specific” on a certain technology level (e.g., renewable energy), it might still be “neutral” (or “unspecific”) on the level below (solar energy). Hence, policy makers have to decide how specific the policy should be, i.e., on what level of the technology hierarchy a policy instrument should intervene. Our paper builds upon this notion and contributes to the debate on the effect of deployment policies on technological lock-in by introducing another dimension: multiple applications. Thus far the lock-in potential of deployment policies has typically been analyzed assuming different competing technologies in one single application, overlooking the fact that the lock-in effect of deployment policies may differ from application to application. While many technologies can serve in multiple 168 distinct applications (e.g., solar photovoltaics in open space or roof-top applications), this fact has not yet been considered in the lock-in debate, nor in policy design aiming to avoid lock-in. To address this gap, we investigate the role of multiple applications of technologies for the effect of deployment policies on technological lock-in, and we derive implications for policy makers. Our paper provides three main contributions. First, we revisit the academic lock-in debate and relate it to the economic literature on multiple applications of technologies. We then suggest how multiple applications can influence the policy effects on lock-in. Second, to support our theoretical reasoning, we develop a methodology to assess the risk of a lock-in through deployment policies across applications and apply this methodology to four battery technologies in stationary applications. Our results show that the likelihood of investors selecting one technology differs strongly from application to application, which corresponds to strongly varying lock-in risks across applications and in different technologies. Third, we discuss the implications of these results for policy makers and for the academic debate on technological lock-in. Referring to the notion of Azar & Sanden (2011) that policies can have different technology-specificity levels, we develop the idea of the application- specificity of policies. The paper is structured as follows. In the theory part (Section 2), we review the literature on deployment policy and lock in and develop our theoretical argument about multiple applications. In Section 3 we describe the scope and methodology to assess the risk of a lock-in through deployment policies through a simulation of investor decisions. Section 4 shows our results, and we discuss their implications for the path-dependency literature and policy makers in Section 5. We conclude the paper in Section 6. 2. Theory This section develops the theoretical argument of the paper. Specifically, it derives, in three steps, why and how the fact that some technologies have multiple distinct applications is highly relevant for the debate on deployment policies and technological lock-in. First, the link between deployment policies and lock-in is discussed (2.1). Then the debate on how to avoid lock-in through deployment policies is summarized (2.2). Finally, we contribute to the existing literature by introducing multiple applications of a technology as a new factor for debate on deployment policies and lock-in (2.3). 2.1 Deployment policies and the risk of technological lock-in Especially in the energy sector, deployment policies have become increasingly popular in recent years (Peters et al., 2012; Hoppmann et al., 2013). For instance, 109 countries around the world had introduced some form of deployment support mechanism for electricity generated by renewable energy technologies by the end of 2012 (REN21, 2012). Typically, these policies target technologies 169 that have reached a certain maturity level but have not been adopted by the market on a large scale, e.g., due to higher costs or a high degree of technological uncertainty. These policies aim to diffuse the targeted technologies and induce technological learning and innovation by “driving down” the technologies’ learning curves and thereby increasing their competitiveness (Sagar and van der Zwaan, 2006; Benthem et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2012c). While many analyses focus on the cost effectiveness of different deployment policy instruments (cf., del Río González, 2012; IRENA, 2013a), one debate concerns the question of whether deployment policies can lead to a premature technological lock-in. A lock-in can be understood as a persistent state in which an economy is “trapped” in a specific technology (e.g., internal combustion engines for passenger vehicles) or a specific kind of technological system (e.g., fossil fuel-based centralized electricity system). In such a state this technology or technological system is adopted by the vast majority of users, and alternative technologies have little chance of increasing market shares without exogenous shocks (Unruh, 2000; Vergne and Durand, 2010; van der Vooren et al., 2012). The determinants of a lock-in can be found in path-dependent and self-reinforcing processes (Dosi, 1982; David, 1985; Arthur, 1989, 1994; Krugman, 1991, 1996; Vergne and Durand, 2010), which result from factors both on the technology supply side (economies of scale in production, economies of scope, learning-by-doing, standardization) and on the demand side (decreasing uncertainty, learning-by-using, network externalities, economies of scale in consumption) (Katz and Shapiro, 1985; Arthur, 1989; Sandén and Azar, 2005; van den Bergh, 2008). These self-reinforcing processes are often present in the case of complex technologies (David, 1985; Arthur, 1989; David and Rothwell, 1996). Deployment policies can trigger such self-reinforcing processes and thereby result in technological lock-ins (Hoppmann et al., 2013). Most practitioners and academic scholars agree that deployment policies should be designed in such a way as to avoid a lock-in into one technology, because otherwise long-term inefficiencies can result (Unruh, 2002; del Río González, 2008; van den Bergh, 2008; Kalkuhl et al., 2012): “Superior” technologies with a higher endogenous learning potential might be locked out, increasing the economic costs of deployment in the long-run (Arthur, 1989; Sandén and Azar, 2005; del Río González, 2008). Using the concept of learning curves (Rubin et al., 2004; Jamasb, 2007), Figure 1 illustrates how a lock-in into Technology A (corresponding to a lock-out of Technology B) may entail long-term inefficiencies. While evolutionary dynamics play an important role in lock-in processes (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 2000; Safarzyńska et al., 2012), very early adoption preferences of users can already determine lock-in (David, 1985; Arthur, 1989). The likelihood that users will adopt one specific technology corresponds to the degree of competition between a technology and its rival technologies. Consequently, the degree 170 of competition among technologies, once the policy is introduced and intervenes in the market, is an important predictor of lock-in risk. Note that thus far lock-in research typically assumes one single market for rival technologies. We will introduce the fact that technologies can compete on different markets in Section 2.3. A low degree of competition is very likely to result in a high market share for one technology. Consequently, this technology is likely to profit most from the self-reinforcing processes described above, whereas its rival technologies will benefit less (Arthur, 1989, 1996). While a technology’s dimensions of merit and consequently users’ selection criteria differ across sectors, technologies and user groups, the technology costs are always an important criterion (Abernathy and Clark, 1985; Anderson and Tushman, 1990). Assuming technological substitutability, i.e., different technologies providing highly comparable performance, functionalities and qualities, the degree of competition is strongly correlated with the initial cost differential of technologies, especially if these technologies are new and hardly deployed (del Río González, 2008). 94 Figure 1 shows that a high cost differential between two technologies at the point the deployment policy is introduced increases the likelihood that users will respond to the policy by adopting technology A only, thereby driving the technology down its learning curve. Meanwhile Technology B is scarcely adopted and consequently locked out, resulting in a long-term inefficiency of the deployment policy. FIGURE 1 – TECHNOLOGICAL COMPETITION AND LOCK-OUT OF SUPERIOR TECHNOLOGY 2.2 Technology-neutral or technology-specific deployment policies? While most scholars agree that policy makers should consider potential lock-in effects when designing deployment policies, they debate the best way to avoid premature technological lock-in. One strand of 94 Depending on the industry or market type (e.g., business-to-business or business-to-consumer type markets), costs can refer to the life-cycle costs or to the purchase price of a technology/product (Ferrin and Plank, 2002). Specific cost Deployment (installed capacity) Technology B Technology A Potential short-term efficiency Potential long-term inefficiency Introduction of deployment policy Cost differential 171 literature emphasizes the need for technology-neutral instruments, i.e., instruments “encouraging all efforts that achieve specified objectives without focusing on a particular approach” (Jaffe et al., 2005, p. 171). Proponents of technology-neutral instruments argue that policy makers should avoid selecting single technologies to be supported – especially given their bad track record of ‘picking the winner’ (Krugman, 1996). Aghion et al. (2009, p. 688) argue that in the view of many economists “bureaucrats are assumed to have no independent sources of expert knowledge” and to act on the basis of political considerations rather than market signals. Hence, scholars favoring technology-neutral policies recommend letting several technologies compete against one another under market conditions, which assures the most efficient way of re-allocating resources (Aldy and Stavins, 2011). In cases where deployment policy intervention is justified, these scholars typically recommend implementing economy-wide price instruments that affect all technologies in a given area by altering market selection mechanisms (e.g., through a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade scheme) (Metcalf, 2009). On the opposite side, supporters of technology-specific policies argue that it is exactly technology- neutral policy instruments that carry the risk of a premature lock-out of promising technologies. Similar to a market environment in which buyers typically select the currently (or at least in the short- term) most competitive technology, the technology that is most competitive once a new deployment policy is introduced will benefit most from that technology-neutral policy. In simpler terms, technology-neutral policies drive down the learning curve only of the currently most competitive technology (Aghion et al., 2009; Junginger et al., 2010). In this case, the policy maker does not directly select a technology; rather, the implementation of a supposedly neutral deployment policy results in an indirect selection of a technology as the market mechanism favors one technology, reversing the neutrality of the policy support (Azar and Sandén, 2011). 95 Consequently, this line of argument proposes a set of (complementary) technology-specific instruments to avoid premature technological lock-in (van der Zwaan et al., 2002; Sandén and Azar, 2005; del Río González, 2008; Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte, 2014). A number of empirical papers (e.g., Suurs and Hekkert, 2009; Rogge et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2012c) as well as institutional bodies (e.g., the International Energy Agency) also support the rationale for complementing technology-neutral with technology-specific policy instruments. Recently, Azar and Sanden (2011, p. 137) argued that the “debate about whether […] policies should be technology specific becomes rather meaningless, and should be replaced by a discussion about how technology specific the policies should be.\" Their argument asserts that the contrast between technologically neutral and specific policies does not truly exist. Rather, policies can be specific (or neutral) only on a certain technological hierarchy level: a policy that is “specific” on a certain 95Aghion, David and Foray (2009) argue that the common assertion that governments are worse than the private sector at picking “winners” lacks empirical evidence. 172 technology level might still be “neutral” (or rather “unspecific”) on the hierarchy level below. To illustrate their argument, they offer the example of feed-in tariff specificity: a feed-in tariff for renewable electricity is less specific than one for solar electricity, which in turn is less specific than one for solar PV, which again is less specific than a tariff for thin-film solar PV. Thus, policy makers do not have to decide between technology-neutral and technology-specific instruments. Rather, they have to decide how specific the policy should be, or in other words, on which technological “hierarchy” the policy should intervene. Using power generation as an example, Figure 2 gives an illustration of the technology hierarchy levels and provides examples of deployment policies on each level. FIGURE 2 – TECHNOLOGY-SPECIFICITY, TECHNOLOGY HIERARCHY LEVELS AND EXAMPLES OF DEPLOYMENT POLICIES – ADAPTED FROM WINSKEL ET AL. (2013) In case the degree of competition among technologies competition among technologies is low at the technology hierarchy level on which policy intervenes, markets are expected to select the leading technology/ies on that very hierarchy level. This theoretical assumption is supported by the following empirical evidence: In the US, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), which mandate a power generator to produce a certain amount of electricity from (new) renewable energy sources, are of widespread use. As RPS do not differentiate between renewable technologies, these policies resulted in the adoption of almost exclusively wind – 94% from 1998 to 2009 (Wiser et al., 2010)) – the cheapest renewable technology in that period of time.96 By contrast, the German Feed-in Tariff (FiT), which is enacted at a more specific technology level and provides different support to different technologies (Reiche and Bechberger, 2004), resulted in a more diverse portfolio of technologies: 58% wind, 26% solar PV, and 13% bioenergy (see ZSW-BW, 2013). Thus, where the degree of 96 Hydro, which has typically had lower costs than wind, is typically excluded from RPS. The 6% non-wind new renewables mostly occurred under RPS schemes featuring technology differentiators (Lewis and Wiser, 2007; Wiser et al., 2010) and are therefore specific on a technology level (compare Figure 2). Increasing technology- specificity Economy Sector (e.g., power sector) Technological field (e.g., renewable energy, energy storage) Technology (e.g., PV, batteries) Sub-technology (e.g., cSi PV, lithium-ion) Technological design  Carbon tax, Cap & Trade policies  Sectoral Emissions Trading Schemes, Sectoral Standards  Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)  Feed-in tariffs, RPS with technology differentiators  Differentiated feed-in tariffs for different sub technologies Technology hierarchy level Examples of deployment policy 173 competition among technologies is low at a certain technology hierarchy level, increasing the specificity of deployment policies helps to avoid premature lock-in. In more abstract terms, depending on the competition among technologies on different hierarchy levels the technology- specificity of policy can determine the lock-in risk. To mitigate that risk, it is consequently important to consider the competition among technologies across different levels when designing or enacting deployment policies. However, to further develop the debate and improve policy advice support informed policy design, we challenge an assumption in the literature: lock-in studies (at least implicitly) assume that technologies typically compete in only one defined market and that, depending on the hierarchy level, policy makers intervene in that very market. 2.3 Multi-purpose technologies and lock-in While the debate on deployment policies and lock-in has advanced in recent years, scholars have typically analyzed different substitutable technologies in one single application. However, often technologies can serve multiple applications and consequently compete on different markets, a fact that has not been considered in the lock-in debate or in policy design aiming to prevent lock-in. In the following, we enhance the lock-in literature to include technologies with multiple distinct applications (i.e., multi-purpose technologies – MPTs). Economic growth literature emphasizes that an important aspect for differentiating technologies is the number of use cases in an economy. Some technologies are typically employed for one single purpose (e.g. a laptop charging adapter) by mainly one user group, while so-called “general-purpose technologies” (e.g., the microprocessor) exhibit an almost infinite number of use cases across the economy (Lipsey et al., 1998). Situated between single-purpose and general-purpose, a multi-purpose technology (MPT) can be defined as a “technology that has several distinct, economically relevant applications” (Battke and Schmidt, 2013, p. 5).97 Typical examples of MPTs are x-ray machines, lasers, bio-gasification and batteries (Lipsey et al., 1998; Holm-Nielsen et al., 2009; Battke and Schmidt, 2013). The key characteristic of an MPT is the existence of multiple, economically relevant applications, where an application is defined as a specific source of value creation for a specific user group (Dolata, 2009; Battke and Schmidt, 2013). Thus, an MPT can be understood as a technology that has the potential to create economic value in different ways and for different users. As the applications of MPTs differ in terms of users, value drivers and competing technologies, each application can be 97 In contrast to general-purpose technologies, MPTs lack (i) the potential for a pervasive use across a virtually unlimited number of applications and (ii) the technological complementarities creating economy–wide spillovers (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995; Lipsey et al., 1998; Battke and Schmidt, 2013). 174 conceptualized as a separate niche market in which a technology can develop (Nill and Kemp, 2009). Thus, for MPTs, policy makers can decide which market to intervene in by implementing application- specific deployment policies. An example of a policy that supports different applications is the German feed-in tariff (FiT) for solar PV. While the PV deployment policy that preceded the FiT (the “100,000 roofs program”) was limited to roof-top installations, the FiT, which was introduced for PV in 2003, was no longer limited to roof- tops but also included support for open space installations. Of the approximately EUR 7.3 bn that Germany spent on the FiT subsidy for solar PV in 2011 alone, about EUR 0.8 bn (11%) were given to open-space installations (Prognos and Belectric, 2012). From a sub-technology lock-out perspective, the inclusion of open-space applications to the FiT had important effects. Roof-top and open-space PV are two different applications according to the above definition, as they feature very different user groups: building owners on one hand and energy investors on the other (Dewald and Truffer, 2011). In the roof-top application, crystalline silicon (cSi) PV was more competitive than its rival sub- technology thin-film PV. Consequently cSi was (and still is) dominating the roof-top market. By contrast, thin-film PV was (and still is) cost competitive with cSi in the open space application.98 The FiT for open-space applications helped thin-film PV to gain market share and thereby reduce its cost due to learning-by-doing and learning–by-using (BSW, 2006; Hoppmann et al., 2013). 99 In this way, the FiT helped to avoid locking out thin-film PV simply by including open-space applications.100 While the German policy makers did not deliberately include open-space applications in the FiT to avoid locking out thin-film technology, the decision had a clear effect on the global thin-film industry, especially as Germany represented the most important global market for solar PV during those years (Peters et al., 2012; IRENA, 2013b). In 2005, the US-based company First Solar, the world’s leading thin-film PV cell manufacturer, generated 100% of its net sales in Germany, and even in 2011 it was still 23% (First Solar, 2006, 2011). This example shows how the degree of competition among a set of technologies at the point the policy is introduced can differ strongly from application to application. Consequently, the lock-in risk of deployment policies differs across applications. Enacting a specific application-based deployment policy can result in the market selecting – i.e. locking-in – one technology if the degree of competition among technologies is low in that application. Conversely, enacting deployment policies for various applications, or enacting one policy for an application with a high degree of competition among 98 Thin-film exhibits lower cost per watt installed, which makes it more cost competitive in large-scale applications (Peters et al., 2011) However, it also has a lower cell efficiency, which lowers its competitiveness in roof-top applications where space is contrained and soft costs (i.e. those beyond the PV module) are more important than the module costs (Seel et al., 2014). 99 Thin-film PV reached a market share of about 8% in Germany, which is equivalent to an estimated 50% market share within open space installations in Germany (ARGE, 2008; First Solar, 2011; Prognos and Belectric, 2012; BDEW, 2013). 100 As of 2010, the global market share of thin-film was around 13% compared to 86% for cSi (Hoppmann et al., 2013). 175 technologies, reduces the lock-in risk. Hence, in order to base policy design on good information, policy makers need to know the degree of competition of technological alternatives for MPTs not only across different hierarchical levels, but also in different applications. To support our argument, in the following we assess the degree of competition among four different battery technologies across different applications in order to derive implications for policy makers as well as the lock-in debate. 3. Methodology This section gives an overview of the methodology employed to assess the competition among technologies. We start by motivating stationary batteries as a case example (3.1). Then, the methodology of the lifecycle cost calculation employed to assess the relative performance of technologies is presented (3.2). Finally, we describe how the degree of competition among technologies can be assessed using a simulation of investor decisions (3.3). 101 3.1 Case example: Stationary batteries as multi-purpose technology We employ the case of stationary batteries to show how the degree of competition among technologies varies across different applications. Stationary batteries have multiple distinct economically relevant applications in the economy and thus are a primary example of a multi-purpose technology (MPT). They have different sources of value generation (e.g., Power Reliability, Power Quality, or Arbitrage) and they can be employed by different users (e.g., end-consumers, industrials, utilities, network operators), creating multiple distinct applications (cf. Appendix A). Consequently, stationary batteries are well suited to exemplify the varying degree of competition across applications. Two additional arguments support the focus on stationary batteries. First, the analysis of deployment policies for stationary batteries is highly relevant given recent efforts by policy makers to support these technologies. In power systems with increasing shares of wind and solar power generation, the ability of stationary batteries to decouple power generation and consumption can be instrumental to maintaining grid stability (Georgilakis, 2008; Hedegaard and Meibom, 2011). As the high costs of stationary batteries currently inhibit the large-scale deployment of these technologies, deployment support policies have started to be introduced in several countries in order to foster innovation and diffusion of stationary batteries (Borden and Schill, 2013). Second, the power sector, to which stationary battery technologies belong, is especially prone to lock-ins. Electricity is a homogeneous good and thus technologies used for storing electricity are typically highly substitutable (Kalkuhl et al., 101 Note that we apply a static modeling approach, focusing on the initial degree of competition only. Another simplification is that in our simulation, investors decide purely based on life-cycle cost. While we are aware of the limitations of these approaches, our intention is to support our theoretical argument in a first approximation. See Section 5.2 for a discussion of these limitations and ideas for future research. 176 2012). Given the high degree of substitutability, no niche markets for specific technologies exist, underlining the risk of a lock-in where one technology is the most cost competitive. Moreover, the power system is characterized by long investment cycles, high upfront capital costs, network externalities and economies of scale, increasing the risk of lock-ins (Unruh, 2000, 2002; Schmidt et al., 2012b). 102 Specifically, we assess the degree of competition among the four battery technologies lead-acid, lithium-ion, sodium-sulfur and vanadium redox flow batteries.103 These four battery technologies were chosen since they are typically seen as the technologies with the highest potential for grid-connected electricity storage (Proser, 2011; Sauer et al., 2011). 3.2 Levelized lifecycle costs calculation In order to compare the costs of the four battery technologies and thus to shed light on their relative competitiveness, we calculate their lifecycle costs in terms of Levelized Costs of Electric Capacity (LCOEC). As different technologies exhibit different investment costs, operating costs, efficiencies and lifetimes, a comparison on a fair basis needs to incorporate both costs and performance characteristics. By putting the total annualized costs of a technology (investment costs and operating costs) that occur during its lifetime in relation to the installed electric capacity (in kW-yr), the LCOEC are an appropriate indicator to compare different energy technologies (EPRI, 2010; Madlener and Latz, 2013). 104 ∑ (1) The LCOEC of the four battery technologies are calculated in two steps. First, depending on both application parameters (required power rating and discharge duration) and on technology parameters 102 The high likelihood of a lock-in in various segments of the power system is reflected in the multiple scientific studies investigating this phenomenon across technologies. Lock-ins have been described and discussed in the literature for fossil power generation technologies (Islas, 1999), nuclear reactor types (Cowan, 1990), and renewable power generation technologies (Menanteau, 2000; Hoppmann et al., 2013). 103 Dunn (2011) provides a description of battery technologies. 104 In other words, the LCOEC describe the average annual costs of owning and operating a 1 kW stationary battery employed in a specific application accounting for investment costs, financing costs, operating costs, replacement costs, lifetime and efficiency. LCOEC: Levelized costs of electric capacity [EUR/kW-yr] CAPEX: Investment costs [EUR] OPEX: Operation & maintenance costs [EUR] kW_year: Installed electric capacity [kW-yr] r: Discount rate [%] T: System lifetime [years] t: year 177 (roundtrip efficiency and maximum depth-of-discharge), the required size of the battery installations is calculated. 105 Second, we employ probabilistic calculation of the LCOEC using the Monte Carlo simulation technique with 10’000 runs in order to account for the high degree of uncertainty present in the main battery input parameters (Hanna et al., 1998; Steward et al., 2009). 106 Specifically, the LCOEC are calculated using the stochastic technology input parameters energy capacity costs, roundtrip efficiency, calendrical life and cycle life as well as the deterministic input parameters power conversion system costs, balance-of-plant costs, and operations & maintenance costs. An overview of the input values can be found in Appendix B. We calculate the LCOEC of the battery technologies for the four applications End-consumer Power Reliability, Support of Voltage Regulation, Wholesale Arbitrage, and End-consumer Arbitrage. These four applications were chosen for their highly diverging technical requirements, which result in different degrees of competition and different technologies being the most cost competitive across applications. A detailed description of the four applications can be found in Battke and Schmidt (2013), the technical parameters to model these applications can be found in Appendix C. 3.3 Assessment of the degree of competition among technologies While the probabilistic LCOEC calculation gives a first impression of the relative competitiveness of technologies, it does not assess to what extent specific technologies diffuse in the market. However, as the expected diffusion in the market is pivotal for assessing the degree of competition among technologies and thus the risk of a technological lock-in, we simulate investment decisions by independent actors. In particular, we calculate the degree of competition based on a simulation of 10,000 independent actors who each decide in which technology to invest depending on their assessment of the LCOEC of the four battery technologies. Based on the actors’ investment decisions and thus on the expected initial market shares, the Technological competition coefficient (TCC) summarizes the degree of competition among technologies. The remainder of this section describes the actor-based model (3.3.1), introduces the TCC (3.3.2) and develops a way to assess the degree of competition across multiple applications (3.3.3). 105 In order to achieve the required discharge duration of the application, the size of the battery system is increased, accounting for electricity losses and limitations in the depth-of-discharge (i.e. the maximum energy to be withdrawn from the battery as a share of the total energy capacity of the battery). 106 Monte Carlo simulation is a numerical method to solve mathematical problems (Jacoboni and Reggiani, 1983). By repeatedly calculating the LCOEC with different sets of input values drawn from random distributions, the Monte Carlo simulation can account for the uncertainty present in input parameters. PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) distributions are assumed for the stochastic variables. 178 3.3.1 Actor-based simulation of investor decisions In order to calculate the initial degree of competition among technologies, we model the investment decisions in the four battery technologies of 10,000 independent actors in four steps. First, as battery input parameters currently exhibit a high degree of uncertainty, it is assumed that different actors estimate different input values for the main technical parameters of batteries (energy capacity costs, round trip efficiency, calendrical life and cycle life).107 The model incorporates this using random distributions for each of these parameters. The random distributions were constructed from typical values in literature for the respective input parameters and are based on Battke et al. (2013). Second, using these input vales, each actor calculates the LCOEC of each of the four battery technologies in a techno-economic assessment for a given application (cf. section 3.2). Third, each actor invests in the technology that exhibits (from her point of view) the lowest LCOEC.108 Finally, the model observes and stores the investment decisions of each actor in order to forecast the expected initial market shares of technologies and thus the degree of competition among technologies across applications (cf. section 3.3.2). 3.3.2 An indicator to assess the degree of competition among technologies In order to assess the degree of competition among technologies, the investment decisions by each actor are compared. Based on the notion that the degree of competition can be understood as the inverse probability that the market selects one specific technology (cf. section 2.2), the model calculates the Technological Competition Coefficient (TCC) as the share of investors who deviate from the investment decisions of the majority of investors for a given application (cf. Formula 2).109 In other words, the TCC describes the total expected initial market shares of all technologies that are not most cost competitive on average. A low TCC indicates a high lock-in risk, as almost all investors initially choose the same technology whereas a high TCC indicates that investment flows are distributed more evenly across two or more technologies, resulting in a low lock-in risk.110 107 The remaining deterministic input values are described in Appendix B. 108 Although besides lifecycle cost and technical performance additional decision criteria exist for investment in technologies (e.g., security, historic investment decisions), several interviews with project developers and investors indicated that the lifecycle costs are highly relevant for investment decisions in stationary batteries 109 In the following, the term “majority” refers also to a “simple majority” situation, i.e., a situation in which the largest group of investors selecting a specific technology represents less than 50% of all investors. 110 The TCC can take values in the interval of [0; (N-1)/N[ where N denotes the number of technological options. 179 ∑ (2) In contrast to alternative calculation methods to assess the variation of values (e.g., the variance, standard deviation or the mean deviation), the focus of the TCC is on the competition at the top, i.e., the competition of the leading technologies. This makes the TCC a relevant metric for the risk of technological lock-in, as only those technologies that are most attractive for investors have a chance to diffuse in the market. For instance, in a case in which three out of four technologies are in close competition, with similar costs and service characteristics, while the fourth technology is significantly more attractive for investors, a low variance (or standard deviation) would result. In this case, a variance-based metric would indicate a low lock-in risk as the majority of technologies are in close competition, although the real risk is high. In contrast, the TCC would identify the high lock-in risk correctly as the large majority of investors would select the same technology and thus only this technology would be deployed. 3.3.3 Holistic assessment of the degree of competition in the “application landscape” Whereas section 3.2 described the methodology to assess the relative performance of stationary batteries in specific applications, this section describes how the competition among technologies can be investigated holistically. The focus on a selected number of specific applications in the previous sections is useful to outline the methodology and highlight the notion of varying degrees of competition across applications. However, both policy makers and practitioners need a more comprehensive assessment in order to make well- informed decisions. As the technical parameters defining an application all span across ranges and as additional applications may exist, we assess competition among technologies across all possible applications, i.e., independently from individual applications. 111 This also helps, for instance, to 111 For instance, although an assumption of a discharge duration of four hours in the application Increase of Self-consumption is often made, a range from two to six hours is typically described as reasonable (EPRI, 2010; Nair and Garimella, 2010; Battke et al., 2013). TCC: Technological competition coefficient #Investors deviating: Number of investors who deviate from the investment decisions of the majority of investors #Investors: Total number of investors N: Number of technological options, sorted by cost competitiveness 2nd: Second most cost competitive technological option 180 understand whether minor changes of the technical requirements of the application might alter the competitive situation within this application. Therefore, we depict the degree of competition in a two-dimensional matrix (“the application landscape”), covering all possible stationary battery applications, spanned by the factors that impact the relative competitiveness of technologies most: discharge duration and cycle frequency. 112 Essentially, these two factors describe how big the battery needs to be (i.e., investment costs) and how often it has to run (i.e., the operating and replacement costs). To assess the degree of competition among technologies for each spot in the applications landscape, the model iterates the simulation of the investment decisions of the actors (cf. section 3.3.1) and the calculation of TCC for each possible combination of discharge duration and cycle frequency. 113 As a result, the application landscape depicts the degree of competition among technologies holistically, i.e., for all possible applications. 4. Results This section presents the simulation results in two steps. First, the levelized lifecycle costs (in terms of LCOEC) as well as the assessment of the degree of competition (in terms of TCC) for the four specific applications are presented (section 4.1). Second, the relative performance and degree of competition among technologies are shown in the applications landscape, i.e., for all possible applications (section 4.2). 4.1 Costs of and competition among technologies in specific applications Table 1 shows the mean LCOEC and its standard deviation as well as the distribution of investment decisions (i.e., the expected market shares) and the degree of competition among technologies. (For a graphic presentation of the cost distributions, see Appendix D). With respect to the relative performance of the technologies in terms of mean LCOEC, Table 1 shows that different technologies are most cost competitive in different applications. For instance, lead-acid is the most cost competitive technology in End-consumer Power Reliability, while lithium-ion leads in Support of Voltage Regulation, and sodium-sulfur exhibits the lowest mean LCOEC in Wholesale Arbitrage and End-consumer Arbitrage. This implies that depending on the application in which the diffusion of stationary batteries is enabled – either through market mechanisms or through the intervention of policy makers – different technologies are likely to prevail. 112 A sensitivity analysis of the LCOEC across technologies and applications showed that discharge duration and cycle frequency are the application parameters with the highest impact on LCOEC. 113 A constant discount rate of 6% and an electricity price of 100 EUR / MWh are assumed throughout the application landscape. With a resolution of 30,000 combinations of discharge duration and cycle frequency in the application landscape, the model calculates in total 1.2 billion technology assessments (4 technologies, 10,000 actors, 30,000 applications). 181 However, as the exact LCOEC are uncertain (cf. the standard deviation in Table 1), different actors may invest in different technologies for a given application. 114 The expected initial market shares shown in Table 1 reflect the resulting investment decisions; the TCC aggregates them in a single coefficient indicating the degree of competition within an application. The simulation results presented in Table 1 underline to what extent the degree of competition among technologies can vary across applications. For instance, in End-consumer Power-Reliability the vast majority of investors (99.4%) would select lead-acid batteries. This would result in a high risk of a lock-in of the lead-acid technology indicated by TCC of 0.6%. By contrast, in End-consumer Arbitrage only 47.8% of the investors chose the most cost competitive technology (sodium-sulfur), while 35.3% invest in vanadium redox flow, 9.9% in lithium-ion and 7.0% in lead-acid. Thus, in this application, several technologies would co-exist and compete in the market, reducing the risk of a technological lock-in. As the applications of stationary batteries are not limited to the four exemplary ones shown in Table 1, the next section displays the degree of competition among technologies in the application landscape, i.e., across all possible applications. 114 It is assumed that investors lack perfect information about the distribution of the mean LCOEC (in that case, they would select a technology based on the mean LCOEC resulting in a 100% market share for the average most cost competitive technology in each application). 182 TABLE 1: LEVELIZED LIFECYCLE COSTS, MARKET SHARE AND TECHNOLOGICAL COMPETITION ACROSS APPLICATIONSA Application Technology Mean LCOEC [EUR/kW-yr] Standard deviation Expected initial market share b Technological competition coefficient (TCC) End-consumer Power Reliability Lead-acid 79 € 10 € 99.4% 0.6% Lithium-ion 190 € 55 € 0.1% Sodium-sulfur 118 € 11 € 0.4% Vanadium redox flow 154 € 26 € 0.1% Support of Voltage Regulation Lead-acid 73 € 9 € 22.2% 24.5% Lithium-ion 61 € 14 € 75.5% Sodium-sulfur 80 € 3 € 2.3% Vanadium redox flow 95 € 6 € 0.0% Wholesale Arbitrage Lead-acid 711 € 213 € 18.1% 31.5% Lithium-ion 1,338 € 451 € 0.4% Sodium-sulfur 527 € 83 € 68.5% Vanadium redox flow 756 € 203 € 13.0% End-consumer Arbitrage Lead-acid 455 € 131 € 7.0% 52.2% Lithium-ion 491 € 191 € 9.9% Sodium-sulfur 314 € 40 € 47.8% Vanadium redox flow 333 € 64 € 35.3% a Most cost competitive technology underlined for each application b Distribution of investment decisions 4.2 Leading technologies and competition among technologies in the application landscape In order to assess the competition among technologies holistically, we simulated the distribution of investment decisions in battery technologies for each spot in the application landscape (cf. section 3.3.3). Figure 3 shows the results of this simulation and indicates the leading technology (in terms of cost competitiveness), the locations of several prominent applications, and the risk of a lock-in across the application landscape. The present section briefly discusses the leading technologies across the application landscape before shifting the focus to the degree of competition among technologies. 183 The leading technology is defined as the technology that is on average perceived of as most cost competitive, i.e., as the investment decision of the majority of actors. Figure 3 indicates that each battery technology has its “sweet area” in the application landscape: each battery technology is the primary investment choice of actors for a specific range of combinations of discharge duration and cycle frequency. Specifically, given relatively low investment costs along with a short cycle life, lead- acid has a comparative advantage for rarely used applications. With increasing scale and cycle frequency, the advantage shifts to sodium-sulfur, and with further increasing cycle frequency, it shifts further to vanadium redox flow. Lithium-ion excels in all applications with a high power-to-energy ratio (i.e., with rather short discharge durations). Figure 3 also depicts the degree of competition among the four battery technologies using a color scale (warmer colors representing a higher degree of competition). Appendix E displays the same information across three dimensions in order to better visualize the slope of the degree of competition. The main result shown in Figure 3 is the strong variation of the degree of competition across the application landscape. While in some areas, one technology is very likely to be selected by users, other areas are marked by close technological competition. Naturally, the degree of competition increases towards the border between two areas where different technologies are the primary choice of investors. Thus, while lithium-ion, lead-acid and vanadium redox flow have areas where they enjoy a clear lead with almost no competition (dark blue), sodium-sulfur faces strong competition almost everywhere due to its position in the center of the landscape. The area with the highest competition, in which up to 70% of investors deviate from the majority investment decision, is rather small and close to the center of the landscape and exhibits steep slopes (Appendix E). Figure 3 can be related to the results shown in Table 1. While End-consumer Power Reliability (B) is located in a dark blue area indicating a low degree of competition, Figure 3 depicts a moderate degree of competition for Support of Voltage Regulation (A) and for Wholesale Arbitrage (D). Finally, End- consumer Arbitrage (C) is located in the green-marked area indicating a higher degree of competition. 184 FIGURE 3 – DEGREE OF COMPETITION AMONG BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES IN THE APPLICATION LANDSCAPE 5. Discussion The results presented in the previous section underline the relevance of the application perspective for deployment policies and technological lock-in. This section builds on these findings in order to derive the implications for theory and policy makers (5.1), while then discussing additional policy-relevant factors (5.2). Moreover, it briefly discusses limitations and avenues for further research (5.3). 5.1 Specificity of deployment policies along two dimensions Our paper aims to advance the academic debate on the role that deployment policies can play with respect to technological lock-in. In this paper we specifically focus on the role of different applications of technologies. This aspect has been ignored thus far in the academic debate and in policy design, despite its large potential impact on technological lock-in. Our simulation of investors’ decisions shows that the degree of competition among a set of technologies can differ strongly across applications. While some applications exhibit a fierce competition among several technologies, one technology may enjoy a clear lead in another application. In yet another application, a different technology can clearly lead. This corresponds to strongly varying lock-in risks across applications and in different technologies. Our study is limited to battery technologies in stationary applications. Nevertheless, we are confident that major differences in a Share of actors who deviate from the majority investment decision (Technological competition coefficient (TCC)) Cycle frequencyDischarge duration monthly weekly daily 1/2 1 2 4 hourly 1 5 10 30 min h 2 4 8Degree of competitiona Sodium- sulfur Vanadium redox flow Lead-acid Lithium-ion A C D HIGH LOCK-IN RISK HIGH LOCK-IN RISK HIGH LOCK-IN RISK LOW LOCK-IN RISKB End-consumer ArbitrageCA Support of Voltage Regulation Wholesale Arbitrage DB End-consumer Power Reliability 185 competition across applications can be found for many multi-purpose technologies, where deployment policy intervention is currently in place or may possibly be enacted in the future (compare the solar PV example given in Section 2.3). Hence, enacting an application-specific deployment policy without considering the degree of competition bears the risk of unintentionally locking in a certain technology if this technology is the most cost competitive in the selected application. The resulting reduction in technological variety may entail long-term inefficiencies (cf. section 2.2). Note that in case of MPTs a lock-in can result in additional inefficiencies: Depending on the market size and growth that an application-specific deployment policy triggers, the potentially resulting technological lock-in can affect other applications. In the case the market-favored technology learns relatively quickly, its costs can be reduced to an extent that it outperforms the technology originally leading in other applications which are not supported. Especially with respect to the scale of support policies for clean energy technologies (REN21, 2012), policy makers should consequently make sure to incorporate the degree of competition among technologies and across applications in their decisions. If the policy maker is informed about the degree of competition among technologies across applications, what options are available to avoid a technological lock-in? One option is to target an application that exhibits a sufficient degree of competition among technologies (if such an application exists). In this case, policy makers can ensure that several technologies have the chance to develop and diffuse in the market and thus minimize the risk of a lock-in. Another option is to implement a set of deployment policies that each target a specific application: By supporting several applications in which different technologies each have a high probability of being selected by users, policy makers can avoid premature lock-in. However, they have to be aware that with an increasing number of deployment policies, the complexity and administrative burden of the policies also increases. Yet, policy makers have a third option: adapting the specificity of a policy. Azar and Sanden (2011) pointed out that policy makers can decide how technology-specific a deployment policy should be. Similarly, in the case of multi-purpose technologies, policy makers can also decide on how application-specific a deployment policy should be. Consequently, policy makers aiming to maintain or reach a desired level of technology diversity are faced with choosing the specificity level of the deployment policy along two dimensions: a technology and an application dimension. Figure 4 depicts the decision space for policy makers schematically. In order to make the concept of the decision space more illustrative, Figure 4 features five currently enacted deployment policy instruments affecting stationary electricity storage. Each policy instrument has a different combination of technology-application-specificity. The figure shows that in general, policy makers can decide independently on the specificity of deployment policies with respect to technologies and applications covered. For instance, an (I) economy-wide carbon tax benefits all technologies in an economy that 186 have a relatively low level of emissions independent of any application. A (III) loan guarantee for clean energy technologies is more specific with respect to the technologies covered, whereas a (II) pay-for-performance regulation for specific energy technologies employed in spinning reserve is additionally more specific with respect to the application covered.115 A (V) deployment policy that is restricted to one sub-technology (e.g., lithium-ion batteries) is the most specific example on the technology dimension. FIGURE 4 – DECISION SPACE FOR DEPLOYMENT POLICIES116 When deciding on the specificity of deployment policies, policy makers need to be aware of the fact that the more neutral a deployment policy is, the higher the likelihood that users pick applications and respective technologies based on short-term competitiveness. In case the degree of competition is too low, policy makers can increase the specificity of a policy on the technology and/or the application dimension. The more specific the policy program becomes, the more specifically the policy maker must select the number and type of technologies and applications to target. The option to shift between application-specificity levels is also illustrated by the example of the German support policies for PV for roof-top and open-space applications (cf. section 2.3). While the initial policy was limited to the roof-top application and therefore very specific, the subsequent FiT was less application-specific and 115 Spinning reserve is a specific form of Area & Frequency Regulation which is described in Appendix A. 116 FERC stands for U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; DOE stands for U.S. Department of Energy; KfW stands for the German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (Reconstruction Credit Institute), METI stands for Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) loan program 1705 is also more application-specific than a carbon tax because the granting of a loan is “subject to various conditions” (Borden and Schill, 2013, p. 9). Application dimension Neutral Application- specific Technology- specific Technology dimension (I) Carbon tax on hydrocarbon fuels, Norway 1991 Examples (IV) Investment grant for PV- connected battery storage with grid connection (KfW 275), Germany 2013 (V) Investment grant for lithium- ion batteries in grid-connected applications (METI), Japan 2014 (II) Pay-for-performance for fast responding energy devices employed for spinning reserve (FERC Order 755), USA 2011 (III) Loan guarantee for advanced clean energy technologies (DOE 1705), USA 2009 187 thus included open-space applications. However, in 2004, a differentiated FiT for open-space applications was introduced (with tariffs set about 30% lower than for roof-top applications, to reflect the lower costs of open-space applications stemming from such factors as economies of scale) (Bundesgesetzblatt, 2003). In this way, the German policy maker moved back to a more application- specific policy, while supporting two different applications of a single technology in parallel.117 5.2 Additional policy-relevant factors While in 5.1 we focused on the direct theory and policy implications from our analysis, we now discuss four additional points that are closely related and very relevant for policy design. A first additional important factor policy makers aiming to avoid technology lock-in have to consider is the market size and growth that is created through the deployment policy. The potential of a technology to realize improvements in cost and performance, e.g., through learning-by-doing and learning-by-using, is a function of its deployment and thus increases with the market size. Hence, if a deployment policy targets a specific technology but this only leads to limited diffusion of the technology because the resulting market size is too small, the technology will not be able to drive down the learning curve. If at the same time a competing technology (e.g., in a different application) exhibits a much higher diffusion through another deployment policy, the lock-in danger persists despite the fact that the policy maker targeted several technologies through application-specific deployment policies in parallel. Often, technologies that are not reached through deployment policies are not fully lost but survive in niches (Hoppmann et al., 2013). However, whether they will be able to compete on mass markets is questionable and depends in part on how far the competing technology or technologies are driven down the learning curve. Second, until now, we have focused on the risk of deployment policies in facilitating premature (i.e., short-term to mid-term) technological lock-in. However, policy makers may also have an interest in maintaining technological diversity in the long-run, as technological diversity can deliver value from two sources in addition to Arthur’s (1989) efficiency argument. First, low technological diversity limits the possibility for inter-technology knowledge spillovers and positive effects from “recombinant innovation” (van den Bergh, 2008; van der Vooren et al., 2012). 118 Second, technological diversity is one of the main prerequisites of a resilient economy able to adapt to unexpected shocks (Stirling, 2007, 2010; Kharrazi et al., 2013). Maintaining or even increasing technological diversity can thus be understood as an “investment” justifying policy interventions in order to increase the long-run efficiency and resilience of an economy (van den Bergh, 2008; Stirling, 2010). Technological diversity 117 In addition, this FiT differentiation by application was not driven by lock-in but by pure policy cost reduction considerations. 118 Combining knowledge from distinct technologies in a new technology or in new settings is recognized as a main driver of innovation (Gilfillan, 1935; Usher, 1954; Arthur, 2009). 188 should be considered as a continuum, not as a binary indicator. Consequently, policy makers need not choose between diversity and lock-in; rather they have to decide on the “optimal” level of technological diversity and the associated costs they have to incur to achieve it (David and Rothwell, 1996, p. 196). In the words of van den Bergh (2008, p. 566): “[…] an optimal investment decision really comes down to identifying the optimal level of diversity rather than choosing a particular option.” Hence, in order to select a technology-application-specificity level, the degree of competition needs to correspond with the desired technological diversity. To maintain this desired diversity level in the long-run, policy makers need to monitor competitiveness levels and eventually intervene or readjust existing intervention over a longer period. Third, in addition to deployment policies, policy makers have the option to implement R&D support policies in order to prevent a premature lock-in. Recent papers (e.g., Jaffe et al., 2005; Taylor, 2008; Peters et al., 2012; Hoppmann et al., 2013) argue that over the past decades, policy makers have focused too narrowly on deployment policies and have neglected R&D support. They stress the importance of a policy mix that combines deployment policies with supply side policies. Regarding R&D support policies, the debate on how technology-neutral (basic) or specific (applied research) the support should be is much older (Bush, 1952; Martin, 2012). But, similarly to deployment policies, they can be more or less technology-specific (Azar and Sandén, 2011). At least with regard to applied research, the application dimension seems relevant, as the name ‘applied research’ implies. Supporting applied research for one specific application (e.g., a battery for a submarine) may produce a very different technological outcome than supporting another application (e.g., a stationary power back-up). Tailoring a mix of deployment and R&D support policies to avoid lock-in is possible, but admittedly a complicated task. Fourth and finally, how freely policy makers can choose the specificity of deployment policy, even if they are very well informed about the competitive levels across technologies and applications, naturally depends on several constraints. (i) Increasing the specificity of a policy (along either dimension) is correlated with an increasing administrative burden. 119 (ii) Moreover, technological diversity is just one of several aspects policy makers use to decide on the specificity of deployment support. Another important aspect is the cost of deployment policies. As the gap to profitability without market intervention differs from technology to technology (e.g., IPCC, 2011; IRENA, 2012a; Schmidt et al., 2012a) and from application to application (VDE, 2012), targeting different technologies and applications results in different costs. (iii) Some policy instruments are by definition relatively application-specific and even technology-specific (e.g., net metering, which is mainly limited to photovoltaics in roof-top applications), which also limits the selection freedom. This is 119 This is especially true as many support policies have to be reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the induced technological learning (Hoppmann et al., 2014). 189 especially true as the political economy (and the path-dependency that may also exist in politics) can result in the practical exclusion of some instruments (Pierson, 2000). (iv) Similarly, the political feasibility of targeting specific technologies or applications might strongly vary. While the technology dimension mostly affects technology suppliers’ interests, advocacy from suppliers is to be expected (Jacobsson and Lauber, 2006; Torvanger and Meadowcroft, 2011). Hence, the presence of a certain industry in a country can strongly influence the political feasibility on the technology dimension. The application dimension mainly affects users’ interests, making user advocacy more likely. Other than technology suppliers, technology users are always found within the country enacting a deployment policy, which implies different political dynamics along the two dimensions. Despite these constraints, in order to balance these factors, a good understanding of the lock-in risks of different policy options is helpful. To this end, the degree of competition among technological options across different applications is important information for policy makers. 5.3 Limitations and future research To our knowledge, our paper is the first in the literature on technological lock-in to investigate the role of multiple applications. As such it is, of course, not free of limitations. We regard the following aspects as especially relevant and worthwhile for future research. The first limitation relates to our modeling assumption that users select technologies based on the life- cycle costs of these technologies (assuming homogeneous product quality). While we argue that this is typically the case in the markets for stationary battery technologies, we are aware that other factors matter to users, especially in end-consumer markets (c.f. Safarzynska and van den Bergh, 2010) as well as in business-to-business markets (e.g., the role of the historical purchase decision by an investor). Future research could aim to integrate additional determinants for investment decisions into the analysis. A second limitation refers to the dynamics of selection processes. If the policy maker aims to use the application-specificity dimension to ensure long-term technological diversity, she needs to consider the dynamics of selection (c.f. Arthur, 1989). Similar to technologies, applications and the application- related selection criteria change over time. This refers to single applications and the importance of different merit dimensions for the market/buyer, as well as to the entire application landscape as new applications may emerge and others become obsolete. While our paper presents a static analysis as a first step, in the future, dynamic lock-in models may be designed to incorporate different applications and their dynamics (c.f. Arthur, 1989; Zeppini and van den Bergh, 2011). 190 6. Conclusion The main objective of this paper was to offer advice to policy makers on how deployment policies can be implemented while at the same time avoiding technological lock-in. While previous studies focused on the relationship between technological lock-in and the specificity of deployment policies, this paper introduced a new factor: the existence of multiple applications of a technology. Based on a review of the literature on deployment policies and lock-in, and supported by actor-based simulation of investment decisions, the relevance of this factor was derived. Policy makers need to be aware of the strongly varying degree of competition among technologies competition among technologies across applications in order to understand lock-in risk through deployment policies. In addition, we enriched the debate on specificity and neutrality of deployment policies by discussing the implications of the application perspective on a more abstract level: Policy makers aiming to maintain or reach a desired level of technology diversity are faced with choosing the specificity level of the deployment policy along two dimensions: technology and application. 191 Appendix Appendix A FIGURE A.1 – APPLICATIONS OF STATIONARY BATTERIES (BATTKE AND SCHMIDT, 2013) 120 120 By depicting 14 applications in the power system across a matrix of source of economic value and location in the electricity supply chain, Appendix A exemplifies the multi-purpose character of stationary batteries.
