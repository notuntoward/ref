What We Did The slides in this presentation are based on interviews with 5,000 registered voters who had already voted or planned to vote in the November election, with interviews conducted October 31st to November 9th, 2024. Support for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in the presidential election, Democrats and Republicans in Senate elections, and Democrats and Republicans in House elections have been adjusted to reflect the actual expected votes as of November 9th. The analysis aims to provide a tool for Americans to understand what happened in the 2024 election, why it happened, and what’s next. Nationwide surveys of registered voters; Each wave represents approximately 1,000 interviews taken over the prior three-five days. Latest wave conducted October 3-October 7, 2024.

About the Study Global Strategy Group conducted an online survey of 5,000 registered voters from October 31st through November 9th, 2024, with respondents recruited from opt-in online panel vendors. Of that 5,000, 4,784 respondents were verified against a voter file (and the other 216 were voters who said they were registering before voting if interviewed before Election Day) and special care was taken to ensure the demographic composition of the sample reflected that of the expected 2024 electorate. The vote shares for Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, House and Senate Democrats, and House and Senate Republicans were also adjusted to reflect a preliminary estimate of the vote in the 2024 election. The margin of error for the full sample at the 95 percent level of confidence is +/- 1.4 percentage points. The margin of error for subgroups varies and is higher.
