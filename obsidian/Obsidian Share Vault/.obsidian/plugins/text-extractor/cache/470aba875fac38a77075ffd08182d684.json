The technique uses a zero-dimensional heat generation model with only three parameters requiring estimation, a simple heat transfer model, and requires just three temperature measurements per cell, voltage and current. The technique has been demonstrated to work for pouch cells with tab cooling and a constant coolant temperature and for charge and discharge rates of C/2, 1C and 2C. Compared to state-of-the-art open circuit voltage (OCV) model methods, the technique predicts electrode capacities and offset of a fresh cell with accuracies of 3% and 6% respectively. Further the technique has been shown to predict loss of lithium and loss of active material in the positive and negative electrodes with accuracies of 0.18%, 0.22% and 1.99% respectively. The technique can therefore provide information of the same quality as the current state-of-the-art techniques but works under application relevant conditions and due to its simplicity is suitable for implementation on-line in a battery management system (BMS). © 2021 The Author(s).

Supplementary material for this article is available online Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are becoming more prevalent due to the increase in electriﬁcation of transport and large-scale grid energy storage systems. 1 A key challenge to both of these applications is the reliability and durability of the batteries used as LIBs degrade with use. 2 Accurate diagnosis of the state of degradation of LIBs is critical to ensuring reliability and pre-empting premature battery failure. Improper use of a degraded battery can also accelerate the rate of degradation. As a result, diagnostic information can be used by a battery management system (BMS) to ensure the battery is operating under conditions which do not cause accelerated degradation. 3 LIB degradation is caused by a large number of different but interlinked mechanisms. 4–9 These mechanisms are the chemical and physical changes which occur within the cell causing changes in its observable performance. Whilst being able to completely describe the changes in cell performance, degradation mechanisms are extremely difﬁcult to quantify. Due to the complexity of under- standing and quantifying degradation mechanisms, standard mea- sures of degradation used in industry are much simpler. Capacity fade is the percentage change in cell capacity from its beginning of life (BOL) capacity and is the most common industry measure. State of health (SOH) is often used in place of capacity fade and is equal the capacity lost as a percentage of the initial cell capacity. Another common metric used in industry is power fade which is a measure of how much the cell’s resistance has increased since BOL. While these metrics are simple to measure and can be used as a measure of gross battery performance, they do not provide insight into the internal state of the battery and so do not offer the potential diagnostic beneﬁts that were described above. A diagnostic technique is a combination of a model and measurements in a speciﬁc form that provide information on the permanent changes in a cell which have affected its performance. State of the art diagnostic techniques aim to deliver more detailed information about the internal changes of a cell than SOH and power fade do. Broadly, these techniques fall into 4 categories; impedance methods and equivalent circuit modelling, 10–12 open circuit voltage based methods, 13,14 differential techniques 15–20 and imaging techniques. These can further be grouped by the conditions they require for the technique to be applied. The categories of conditions are given in Table I. The term on-line refers to the diagnostic technique being able to run with the computational power onboard the BMS. It has no relation to the conditions that the cell must be under to run the diagnostic technique. Each diagnostic technique can provide different levels of detail for degradation; the highest being information on speciﬁc degrada- tion mechanisms and the lowest predicting capacity and power fade. There exists an intermediate level known as degradation modes ﬁrst introduced by Dubarry in Refs. 21 and 22. Degradation modes describe the consequences of degradation on the cell, which inherently groups degradation mechanisms together that have similar effects on cell performance. There are 3 commonly reported degradation modes; loss of lithium, loss of active material and impedance changes. Loss of lithium occurs when lithium ions are irreversibly consumed by side reactions. Loss of active material occurs when electrode material becomes unavailable for electro- chemical activity. Finally, changes in battery impedance describe changes in the cells’ non-linear response to an applied load. A large amount of literature on battery impedance changes already exists and therefore this work will not address this degradation mode. Figure 1 shows the conditions that diagnostic techniques are applied in vs the level of degradation detail they provide for the most common diagnostic techniques described in the literature. The ﬁgure also highlights whether the diagnostic technique is quantitative or qualitative. It can be seen that the most desirable techniques sit in the upper right section of the plot as they are implementable online and provide the highest degree of ﬁdelity. Quantitative diagnostic techniques are those which can quantify the extent to which degradation has occurred rather than to just detect the presence of degradation. In this work, we present a novel diagnostic technique which can provide quantitative diagnostic information of degradation modes in- operando. This technique uses instantaneous cell heat generation and temperature throughout charge or discharge to estimate a cells’ stoichiometric parameters; the negative electrode and positive elec- trode capacities as well as their stoichiometric offset. Temperature variation is often seen as a source of error in most diagnostic measurements whereas in this technique it is embraced as a usefulzE-mail: yatish.patel@imperial.ac.uk Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2021 168 030532TableI.Categoriesofcellconditionsthatdiagnostictechniquesfallinto.CategoryConditionsDestructiveRequirescelldisassemblyEx-situDoesnotrequirecelldisassemblybutdoesrequirethecelltobetakenoutofitsworkingenvironmentIn-situDoesnotrequirethecelltoberemovedfromitsworkingenvironmentbutdoesrequireloadproﬁleswhicharenottypicallyseenundernormaluseIn-operandoCanbeappliedtothecellduringitsnormaluse Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2021 168 030532 signal from which information can be gained. From the stoichiometric parameters estimated, cell degradation mode amounts can be calcu- lated. The technique developed in this work has a smaller parameter search space than other diagnostic techniques which attempt to address this research gap without sacriﬁcing the level of degradation information. Literature Review Figure 1 shows that some techniques can diagnose to a high level of detail but require destructive or ex situ conditions to be applied. Alternatively, techniques can be applied on-line but give very basic degradation information. Any techniques below the state of art line are obsolete in terms of diagnostics as they either offer less detailed information or require more restrictive testing conditions. Therefore, novel techniques must be implemented above this diagonal line, either providing more detail or being easier to implement in application. The targeted gap for this work is the on-line diagnosis of degradation modes, as shown in green in Fig. 1, and therefore work that occupies the space around this area will be reviewed. As the new technique focuses on diagnosis of loss of active material (LAM) and loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and not impedance changes, literature on techniques such as electrode impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanic intermitted titration tests (GITT) will not be surveyed. Further, to save the reader time, only the most important works for each technique will be reviewed such as the original work introducing the technique or works that have made signiﬁcant improvements to the techniques. Some of the earliest works in degradation mode diagnostics were conducted by Ira Bloom 23–25 and Matthieu Dubarry21 with their work on differential voltage (DV) analysis and incremental capacity analysis (ICA) techniques respectively. Both techniques use the derivative of the OCV to identify locations of phase transitions in electrode material attributed to peaks in DV and troughs in ICA. Both ICA and DV have been used widely previously to these works, for example Dahn & McKinnon26 used a form of ICA to quantita- tively examine phase transitions in lithium ion cells. However, the works by Dubarry and Bloom were of the ﬁrst to diagnose degradation modes with these techniques. The work by Bloom et al.24 gives details on how DV can be used to detect the presence of LAM and LLI and establish which is dominant. The work was more qualitative than quantitative but showed that it was possible to predict LAM and LLI through a simple OCV measurement of the cell providing the half-cell OCVs were also known before diagnosis. Bloom produced several follow up papers on the DV technique 23,25,27 where it was shown that DV is a method capable of being applied to several cell chemistries and can successfully detect which mode, if any, is dominant at various stages of a cell’s life. Similarly, Dubarry et al.21 showed that ICA was capable of identifying degradation modes by being able to identify how reductions of capacities in different phase combinations could lead to conclusions about which degradation mode is present in the cell. Following works showed that ICA could be applied and show different results for cells which underwent different degradation scenarios, different cell chemistries and different cell formats.22,28,29 While it was shown that ICA could be applied in a multitude of scenarios, the work was mostly qualitative. In Refs. 30, 31 Dubarry et al. introduced a model which could quantify the extent of each degradation mode through a mechanistic model. The model con- sisted of electrode OCV curves whose capacities and offset to each other could be adjusted and from these adjustments, degradation modes could be quantiﬁed. The work then shows how the different degradation modes affect the DV and ICA full cell curves. Further work was done by Dubarry et al. 32 in relating the impact of degradation modes on a cell’s ICA curve. Results show that a small number of features from the ICA curve such as peak position, width and height could be used to estimate degradation modes, instead of needing to ﬁt an entire ICA curve model to experimental data. Birkl et al. 14 developed an OCV model which has the capability of reﬂecting changes in cell electrode capacities and offsets, similar to the way that Dubarry showed in Ref. 30. The model by Birkl et al. in Ref. 14 is designed to be a more general OCV model with the ability to model a broad range of possible chemistries. However, from a diagnostics perspective it offers the same functionality as the model developed by Dubarry et al. in Refs. 30, 31. Until this point, the OCV models produced had not been experimentally validated. Birkl et al. 13 validated their OCV model in Ref. 14 by constructing coin cells from the electrodes of a full cell but with different amounts of electrode material in each. This artiﬁcially created LAM and LLI in the cells. The results showed that the model could accurately predict the amounts of LAM and LLI in the coin cells making the model in Refs. 13, 14 a good bench mark for new diagnostic techniques to be evaluated against. In all of the works mentioned thus far, although in situ they require very slow constant current conditions in order to extract useful degradation information from the diagnostic technique. While simple to measure, such conditions are rarely seen in-operando. Dubarry et al. 30 coupled their OCV model to an equivalent circuit model (ECM) to model the changing impedance of the cell, meaning the model could theoretically be applied to cells under load. This was not shown in Ref. 30 and seems to not be present in Dubarry’s later work 32 with the same model. The addition of an ECM layer also signiﬁcantly increases the number of parameters required by the model and hence decreases its robustness and makes it more difﬁcult to implement in a BMS. There is a plethora of works which try to apply the theories developed in early DV and ICA literature to cells under load. Invariably the studies are only concerned with corre- lating capacity fade to features in the ICA and DV curves rather than quantifying degradation modes. This is because the ICA and DV curves change signiﬁcantly when under load and the models derived by Dubarry30–32 and Birkl13,14 cannot accurately predict degradation modes from data under load. A novel approach to performing diagnostics under load was taken by Wu et al.33 using differential thermal voltammetry (DTV). DTV plots the derivative of temperature with respect to temperature against voltage. As a temperature change is required to obtain this ratio, the cell must be under a load large enough to achieve a measurable temperature change in the cell. The initial work implies that incorporating entropic heat generation information into the measurement would highlight phase change regions in the cell much as is seen in voltage with ICA. Wu et al.33 showed that DTV can provide the same degradation information as the early ICA and DV works. The ﬁndings were qualitative; DTV can detect the presence of degradation but cannot predict the amount of degradation present. The DTV work was further investigated by Merla et al. 34 where it Figure 1. Representation of the diagnostics literature showing level of diagnostic information and the ease of implementation. State of the art line shows where current scientiﬁc research is being conducted. Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2021 168 030532 was shown that cells exposed to different degradation scenarios had differing DTV curves, implying that DTV contained information on different degradation modes. However, this work was still not able to quantify the amounts of degradation modes. Merla et al. also applied DTV at the pack level 35 but still no attempt to quantify degradation modes was made. This work presents a novel technique, which is designed to operate under load and makes use of the thermal information like DTV, making it suitable for in-operando operation, but offers the same quantitative diagnostic capability as OCV models using DV or ICA. Theory Cell heat generation.—The heat generation rate of a lithium-ion cell is given by Eq. 1.36 QIrr is the rate of irreversible heat generated by moving charge through the various overpotentials of the cell and is calculated by Eq. 2. This equation combines reaction, joule and contact overpotentials into the VU I()- term where U is the cell OCV and V is the terminal voltage of the cell. Qrev is the rate of reversible heat generated by the change in entropy of the cell’s electrodes and is given by Eq. 3. Qmix is the mixing heat generated by the movement of particles in the formation and relaxation of concentration gradients during cell cycling at cell temperature T. The mixing term is assumed to be small for high powered cells compared to the total heat generation 37,38 and therefore is neglected in this work. Finally, QSR is the heat generated by the enthalpy of side reactions in the cell. As the cells used in this study have high faradaic efﬁciency, this term is neglected.

The total cell current, I is positive when the cell is charging and U is the cell OCV and UT/¶ ¶ the entropic coefﬁcient of the full cell. In modelling cell heat generation, a zero-dimensional approach is taken meaning all cell quantities are assumed uniform throughout the cell’s volume. Equation 4 then gives the total cell heat generation for the zero- dimensional case. QI V U T U T 4Total ⎜⎟ ⎛ ⎝ ⎞ ⎠ [ ] =- + ¶ ¶ The technique works by comparing the model predicted heat generation to the measured heat generation. The “measured” heat generation is estimated from a cell heat transfer model. To predict the heat generation the cell voltage, current and temperature are measured, and U and UT/¶ ¶ are adjusted according to differing quantities of degradation modes. The output is the set of degradation modes which would minimise the error between the predicted and the measured heat generation. OCV and entropy degradation modelling.—To calculate QTotal from Eq. 4, we must know U and UT/¶ ¶ for the full cell SOC range which are both equal to the difference between the individual electrodes U and UT/¶ ¶ at each SOC as in Eqs. 5 and 6. 14 This is shown for the case of U in Fig. 2. Here xNE refers to negative electrode lithiation fraction and xPE refers to lithiation fraction of the positive electrode. The cell SOC is related to electrode lithiation factions by the linear interpolation given in Eq. 7; x0 and x100 refer to the lithiation fraction at 0% and 100% cell SOC respectively and Ccell & Celec are the cell & electrode capacity respectively. To fully deﬁne the cell OCV, the amounts of each electrode must be known as well as their offset from each other.30 Equation 8 is a rearranged form of Eq. 7 and expresses the capacity of each electrode in terms of x0 and x ,100 where x100 is the electrodes value of x at 100% cell SOC and x0 is the electrodes value of x at 0% cell SOC. The offset is deﬁned as the difference in capacity between x 1PE = and x 0NE = as shown in Fig. 2 by “OFS” and is calculated by Eq. 9 and is a similar form to equations derived by Dubarry et al. 30 USOC U x U x 5cell PE PE NE NE() ( ) ( ) [ ]=- Figure 2.

The capacities of electrodes and the offset between them has already been deﬁned in terms of x by Eqs. 8 and 9 and the same equations can be used to calculate the electrode capacities and offset for a degraded cell. LLI causes a relative shift between electrodes without changing their capacities.30 LAM causes a reduction in electrode capacity. 30 By linearly scaling the electrode curve about the electrode’s delithiated state this ensures that LAM does not contribute to LLI, preventing double counting. Figure 2 shows these effects on the electrode curves for the case of OCV and provides a graphical relationship between fresh and degraded electrode capacities and offsets similar to what is shown in previous studies by other authors. 13,39 Many other works treat lithiated material loss and delithiated material loss as separate degradation modes giving a total of 5 degradation modes. 13 However, Dubarry et al. 32 argue that there is no way to distinguish between lithiated material loss and a linear combination of delithiated material loss combined with LLI as they have the same impact on the electrode capacities and offset as can be seen in Fig. 2. This work agrees with the statement in Ref. 32 and hence both lithiated and delithiated LAM are counted together in a total LAM plus some amount of LLI for the lithiated material loss. From Fig. 2, relationships between LAM, LLI and the electrode capacities can be derived. The subscripts 0 & d indicates the fresh and degraded quantities respectively. It is assumed that xx,,PE PE0 100 xNE 0 & xNE 100 are known for the degraded and fresh states. As the electrode capacity can be found from x0 & x ,100 LAM can be calculated simply as the percentage difference between degraded and fresh electrode capacities as in Eq. 10. The offset of the degraded cell is affected by positive electrode LAM and LLI but not by negative electrode LAM as seen in Fig. 2 and the calculation for LLI is given in Eq. 11.

It should be noted that the lithiation fractions do not need to be known at the limits of cell SOC and instead any two SOC points can be chosen. We can therefore write x  for the case of two arbitrary SOC points named “low” and “up.” The cell capacity, which is not generally known, is now no longer required. Instead, only the amount of charge that has been passed to go from the lower to the upper SOC is needed. The vector x  is deﬁned in Eq. 12 to reﬂect this point. x xx x x 12PE low PEup NElow NE up() []  = Cell heat transfer model.—The heat generation predicted by Eq. 4 must be compared to the heat generation measured. It is not trivial to directly measure the heat generation of a lithium-ion battery, instead the heat travelling along the various thermal path- ways from the cell as well as the temperature rise of the cell is measured. The cell tabs are chosen as the heat rejection pathway in this work, as it ensures that there are minimal thermal gradients in the cell as shown by Zhao et al. 40 This makes the cell more homogenous and as such the zero-dimensional assumption is more valid. Tab cooling is believed to be the most optimal form of cell thermal management as it minimises temperature gradients between cell layers which has been shown to signiﬁcantly improve cell lifetime.41 Recent research into measuring a cells ability to reject heat through different thermal pathways42,43 and optimising the tab cooling thermal pathway44 means industry is now able to widely adopt tab cooling as its primary method of heat rejection. Tesla’s recent patent and subsequent announcement of a tab-less cylindrical cell 45 signals a shift in industry’s focus to ensuring layers of their cells operate under conditions which promote uniform current and temperature throughout the cell. The rate of heat conduction away from the cell is given in Eq. 13, and is estimated by measuring the temperature difference between two points, assuming that the temperature proﬁle between the points is linear. Cell tab materials have high thermal diffusivities making this assumption valid. The ﬁnal consideration is whether the thermal gradient across the tab will be large enough to be measurable with small error. Zhao et al.44 show that the cell tabs are an area of relatively low thermal conductance meaning a large temperature gradient between cell and tab exists. Hales et al. deﬁne the cell cooling coefﬁcient (CCC) for the tabs of the cell used in this study.42,43 The CCC is a measure of the thermal conductance of the cell and is deﬁned by Eq. 14. The CCC can therefore be used to determine how much heat is leaving the cell through the tabs for given cell and tab temperatures. Values for the CCC of the cells in this study are given in Table II. Finally, the heat accumulated by the cell, Q ,accum must be accounted for and is calculated by Eq. 15. Where m is the cell mass and Cp is the speciﬁc heat capacity of the cell and is measured by calorimetry. By totalling all of these modes of heat transfer, the total cell heat generation can be estimated.

The relative amounts of each component in the electrode are unknown at beginning of life and each component may degrade at a different rate. This would have the effect of changing the shape of the positive electrode’s OCV and UT/¶ ¶ vs lithiation fraction. It is possible to construct the OCV vs lithiation fraction for a compound electrode by integrating the sum of the capacity-weighted incremental capacity (IC) curves for each component in the electrode. The case for an N component electrode is given in Eq. 17 where dx dV i() and wi are the IC and capacity weight of the ith component of the compound electrode and V0 is the lower voltage limit of the compound electrode. The sum of the capacity weights is equal to 1 as stated in Eq. 18.

The UT/¶ ¶ for the compound electrode is given in Eq. 19, a full derivation of which can be found in Appendix A. The quantities subscripted with i relate to the individual components within the compound electrode. It is seen that the total electrode UT/¶ ¶ vs lithiation fraction is the weighted sum of the individual component UT/¶ ¶ ’s. The weights in the sum are the individual component IC’s as a fraction of the total electrode IC. Note that IC is usually a function of voltage and so necessarily the UT i()/¶¶ terms should be a function of voltage which would give the result of UT elec()/¶¶ as afunctionofvoltage.To obtainthe ﬁnal UT elec()/¶¶ as a function of lithiation fraction, one can apply the result from Eq. 17 to map voltage to lithiation fraction.

Instead, these quantities are deﬁned by an additional N 1- parameters from the wi terms in Eqs. 17 and 18. Once a set of weights, w ,i has been selected the OCV & UT/¶ ¶ vs lithiation fraction is deﬁned. Following this, the already developed theory applies for determining the stoichio- metric parameters of the cell. Compound electrodes also create the possibility of uneven rates of material loss for each of the electrode components and hence the need to quantify their percentage loss. This is given for the ith component in a compound positive electrode by Eq. 20 where wi 0 is the component’s weighted capacity at beginning of life.

Also, many users of a diagnostic technique do not know the constituent materials of the electrodes in their cells and hence cannot apply the theory developed in this section. In the case of this work, whilst it is known that the electrode is a combination of LCO and NMC, the stoichiometric ratios of the NMC components are unknown. Further, it is expected that the NMC component is not one singular type of NMC but is instead a combination of several types. This fact coupled with the risk to the robustness of the technique has led the authors to treat the relative amounts of NMC and LCO as constant throughout life. In future works where the compositions of the electrodes are better understood, the effect of uneven degradation of electrode components will be investigated, however, for the remainder of this paper is not considered. Experimental Obtaining half-cell measurements for thermodynamic quanti- ties.—To parameterise the heat generation model, coin cells of the individual electrodes were made such that U and UT/¶ ¶ vs lithiation fraction can be measured. The cells used in the test are 5 Ah Kokam pouch cells with an NMC-LCO blended positive electrode and a graphite negative electrode. The procedure for making coin cells and measuring U and UT/¶ ¶ is described in Appendix B & C respectively in the supplementary material (available online at stacks.iop.org/JES/168/030532/mmedia). Table IV shows the voltages of each electrode at their lithiation limits of 0 & 1. The measured OCV and entropic coefﬁcient for each of the half cells are given in Fig. 4.

The temperature of the cell is measured at 3 points along the top surface of the cell and the average of these temperatures is taken as the cell temperature for use in Eqs. 14 and 15. When calculating the heat transfer from the cell, the average temperature of the cell and tab temperature are used. Tab temperature is measured as close to the cell side of the tab as possible to allow maximum contact area between the clamps and cell tab so that heating due to the contact resistance between tab and clamp can be neglected. All temperatures are measured using K-type thermocouples and logged using a Pico Technology TC-08 unit. At the beginning of the test, the rig is allowed to thermally soak at the ambient temperature of 25 °C for 8 h, after this time it is assumed that all parts of the rig are at the same temperature. With the rig at the same temperature, offsets between thermocouples are calculated by averaging each thermocouple’s readings and sub- tracting from the average temperature read by all thermocouples. After the thermal soak period, a characterisation period begins where the Peltier elements cool the ends of the busbars to 15 °C and the rig is allowed to reach steady-state over 8 h. This steady-state char- acterisation period is used to measure the heat loss from the rig through the insulation. The main heat generation test procedure consists of charging and discharging the cell at various constant currents. Different currents are applied to evaluate the diagnostic techniques ability to predict electrode capacities and stoichiometric offset under different condi- tions. The test protocol is summarised in Table V where steps 2, 3, 4 & 5 are performed for x being 2.5, 5 and 10 A. A constant current charge or discharge is applied across the entire cell voltage window followed by a constant voltage hold until the current drops below 100 mA to ensure the cell starting SOC is consistent for each charge and discharge. Following each constant voltage hold, the cell is allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with a 3-hour rest. Throughout the entire test, the Peltier elements maintain busbar end temperatures at 25 °C. The cell is cycled using a Maccor Series 4000 120 A battery cycler and the rig is placed in a Binder KB-400 environ- mental chamber to maintain a temperature of 25 °C. Cell OCV validation.—To evaluate the performance of the diagnostic method, it must be compared to an already established benchmark. The most reliable of the methods to diagnose lithium- ion degradation modes is the OCV test which can predict electrode capacity and stoichiometric offset as is shown in Refs. 13, 32.Todo this test, the same cell which heat generation tests are performed on undergoes a C/25 constant current pseudo OCV test as demonstrated in Ref. 13. As is shown in previous sections, the full cell OCV vs SOC can be expressed by the half-cell contributions for the given start and end lithiation fractions. The measured OCV curve can then be compared to the OCV modelled by the half-cell contributions and the sum of the squared errors calculated. The optimum lithiation fraction vector x  can then be found through the optimisation given in Eq. 21 where USOCmeasured i( ) is the measured cell OCV at SOC i and xUmodel soc i() is the modelled OCV evaluated at SOC i. x x USOC U xx x x arg min ,, , 0, 1 21 i measured i model SOC i PE up PE low NE up NE low 2 4 (( ) ( ) ) () [ ] [ ] å - =Î The best ﬁt lithiation fraction vector found by the optimisation process can be used to calculate cell electrode capacities and stoichiometric offset. The accuracy of the diagnostic technique will be evaluated against the similarities between the electrode capacities and offset calculated from the OCV model, and the electrode capacities and offset calculated from the heat generation technique. Results and Discussion OCV & heat generation ﬁts.—The results for the OCV valida- tion test and subsequent ﬁtted OCV are given in Fig. 6. The overall ﬁt of the data is good with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 61 μV. The largest discrepancy between ﬁt and data is between 2 and 3 Ah of charged capacity where the RMSE is 100 μV. Key features are captured in the ﬁt, such as the inﬂection at around 0.5 Ah and the ﬂattening of the curve at around 1.8 Ah. These features occurring at the correct charged capacity mean that the ﬁtis capturing negative electrode and positive electrode phase changes Table V.

This method and derivatives of this method have been proven to work in previous literature 13,30,32 and so there is conﬁdence in this methods ability to accurately capture the stoichiometric parameters of a cell. Therefore, there is a high level of conﬁdence that the ﬁt accurately represents the behaviour of the cell and that the stoichiometric parameters given in the textbox in Fig. 6 are accurate. Heat generation results for the 0.5C, 1C and 2C discharges and charges are shown in Fig. 7. The measured and modelled total, irreversible and reversible heat generations are shown for each test case. For discharge cases, the shape and magnitude of the total modelled and measured heat generation proﬁles appear equal. However, there is a lag between modelled and measured total heat generation with key features of the modelled occurring earlier than the measured. The time lag is proportional to the C-rate of the experiment and is constant for the major features. The main features are the peak and subsequent trough that occurs between 50% and 75% of the total test time. The charging results in Fig. 7 also have a lag between the modelled and measured results. In contrast to the discharge case, the measured heat generation leads the modelled. Similar to the discharge case however is the proportionality of the lag with C-rate, the exception to this being the trough in the 2C data which occurs at roughly the correct time. Additionally, the magnitude of the modelled heat generation is less than the observed measured heat generation for the charging case. Explaining and correcting heat generation lag.—The amount of lag observed between measured and modelled heat generation is most easily measured by observing the relative trough/peak positions for charge/discharge datasets in Fig. 7. From Fig. 7, the time span of the lag is seen to be inversely proportional to the C-rate of the test, Figure 7. Measured and modelled instantaneous heat generation rates for discharge (left) and charge (right) at various C-rates (indicated) at best ﬁt stoichiometric parameters for each dataset. Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2021 168 030532 meaning the lag is twice as large for the C/2 datasets when compared to the 1C datasets. This also explains the fact that the lag is the same in magnitude but ﬂipped in direction for charge vs discharge data. The fact that the time span of the lag is inversely proportional to the C-rate means the lag occurs over a constant SOC window. There are several possible reasons why lag may occur in the results. One possible reason is thermal lag which would cause the heat generation of the cell during experiments to be measured at a delay compared to when it was truly generated. While thermal lag is impossible to completely remove and is certainly present in the experimental measurements of heat generation, it would always cause the measured heat generation to lag the modelled heat generation. As discussed, this is not seen in the results in Fig. 7 as in the charge dataset the measured heat generation leads the modelled heat generation and therefore the lag cannot be due to thermal lag. Another possible source of the lag is the zero- dimensional model not accounting for lithium diffusion in the particle which would affect the shape of the peak and troughs in Fig. 7. The peak and trough are due to the reversible heat generation as can be seen in Fig. 7. If diffusion dynamics are accounted for in the particle, the reversible heat generation at any time is given by Eq. 22. This equation says the heat generated by a particle is equal to the rate of change of charge accumulated in each locality of the particle multiplied by its entropic coefﬁcient, integrated over the volume of the particle and multiplied by the temperature. This has the effect of averaging the heat generation across the entire particle which would have the effect of ﬂattening and broadening the peak/ trough in the data. Rather than a ﬂattening and widening of the peak/ trough, a shift without a change in width and magnitude is required to correct the lag. Therefore, it is expected that the omission of diffusion dynamics in the model does not account for the observed lag. q dQ dt r U T rdVT. 22rev V () () [ ]ò= ¶ ¶ The only other possible source for the lag is experimental error in the half-cell data which is used to compute the modelled heat generation. The lag is at a constant SOC as discussed and so the experimental error is most likely an error in one or more of the SOCs used in the half cell data. The possibilities are positive electrode SOC error in either the OCV or the UT/¶ ¶ data. Similarly, the error could be in the negative electrode SOC for the same quantities. The error manifests itself as an SOC misalignment between OCV and UT/¶ ¶ in the case of each electrode and therefore applying a relative shift in SOC of one quantity compared to the other will change the value of this misalignment. A shift in SOC would cause the reversible heat peak/ trough to shift which would address the lag seen in Fig. 7. The effect that a relative shift has on the peak/trough location is shown in Fig. 8. From this ﬁgure it is seen that a relative shift in the positive electrode SOCs of 12% completely corrects the lag between modelled and measured heat generation. It is therefore assumed that the source of the lag is due to this reason. All analysis following this point is done with a 12% relative shift applied to the positive electrode SOC for OCV and UT/¶ ¶ and detailed analysis of the quantiﬁcation of the heat generation lag can be found in Appendix D.

Figure 9. Predictions of electrode capacities and offsets from the OCV diagnostic model and the heat generation diagnostic model for charge and discharge datasets. Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2021 168 030532 Predicted electrode capacities and offset.—The predicted elec- trode capacities and offsets for the OCV test and all heat generation tests are shown in Fig. 9. The results are generally in good agreement between datasets with the average and range of errors for each stoichiometric parameter stated in Table VI. In all cases, heat generation technique predictions are within 6% of the values predicted by the OCV technique. In general, the results for the charge dataset are more accurate than those for the discharge dataset, especially the 1C and 2C discharge dataset. There are also typically larger errors and variances for the negative electrode capacity estimations compared to the other parameters. The positive electrode capacity predictions are especially accu- rate with less than 2% average error over all datasets. The positive electrode determines the width of the peak and trough in the discharge and charge datasets respectively shown in Fig. 7 which is a feature that is easy to ﬁt from the heat generation datasets. Similarly, the offset determines the width of the peak and trough in the charge and discharge datasets respectively which is also easy to ﬁt. However, the negative electrode contributes mostly to the steepness of the initial and ﬁnal tail in the charge and discharge respectively. As this occurs over a much shorter time span than the trough and peak in the dataset, the ﬁtting process gives less weighting to this portion of the heat generation proﬁle and hence the results for the capacity of the negative electrode generally have a larger error and more variability. It is expected that with more advanced ﬁtting and feature extraction techniques, that the accuracy of the negative electrode capacity can be improved. However, this paper is intended to prove the concept of the diagnostic technique and therefore has not fully optimised the ﬁtting procedure of the technique. Performance comparison on a degraded cell.—So far, the diagnostic technique presented in this paper has been shown to be able to accurately estimate the electrode capacities and offset of a fresh cell. However, it is yet to be seen whether the technique is able to produce similar accuracies for a cell which has been degraded. While there is no theoretical reason as to why the technique would perform any worse on a degraded cell, there are still two largely unanswered questions to how the technique will perform: how sensitive the technique is to changes in stoichiometric parameters and how the technique fares for a cell with a signiﬁcantly higher resistance than a fresh cell. To answer both of these questions, a cell which has an unknown degradation history was subject to the same OCV and heat generation diagnostic test regimes as the fresh cell. With this data, the stoichiometric parameters predicted by the OCV technique and each C-rate of the heat generation technique are compared. A beginning of life OCV curve is used to determine the stoichiometric parameters at the beginning of life and is the baseline dataset from which LAM and LLI is calculated from. After degradation, another OCV curve is measured and heat generation tests identical to the previous tests are performed. The stoichiometric parameters are predicted using the datasets from the degraded cell for each test case. The predicted parameters for all datasets, including the BOL dataset, are shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that the charge datasets all have predictions which are in good agreement with the OCV degradation dataset with accuracies comparable to the fresh cell dataset. Similar to previous results there is more variation in the negative electrode capacity prediction than the other two parameters for the same reasons discussed earlier. The discharge data on the other hand shows poor performance when compared to the OCV technique. For all discharging cases the positive electrode capacity is overestimated by approximately 10% and the negative electrode capacity is highly variable. The reasons for the difference in performance can be explained by examining the measured heat generation proﬁles and their resulting modelled ﬁts for the parameters given in Fig. 10. The heat generation plots are shown in Fig. 11. In the case of the charging datasets, the peak and trough caused by the reversible heating is still present and thus the ﬁtting algorithm can ﬁnd this feature. The ﬁtting procedure in the charging datasets tries to match the locations of the peak and trough which for reasons discussed in the previous section, gives good predictability of the stoichiometric parameters. In the case of the discharge datasets, the peak and trough are much less visible and so the ﬁtting algorithm cannot ﬁnd a good ﬁt so easily. The reason the peak and trough are more pronounced in the charging dataset is because the reversible heat is negative in the region of the trough and so has a large impact on the shape of the heat generation proﬁle in this region. Conversely the reversible heat generation is positive in the discharge cases and so its impact is not as easily distinguished from the irreversible heat generation. This is actually the helpful way around, as constant current or power charging is very common in most applications, whereas discharges tend to be more noisy and dictated by how the user is using the device. Therefore, it is more likely the diagnostic technique will be used during charging than discharging. There are two potential solutions to improving the performance of the technique under discharging. First, more sophisticated ﬁtting Table VI. Values of stoichiometric parameters predicted by the OCV and heat generation techniques. Both mAh and percentages relative to OCV values given.

Stoichiometric parameter predictions for OCV & heat generation techniques for a degraded cell. Beginning of life (BOL) parameters determined from BOL OCV. Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2021 168 030532 algorithms may be used. The use of the derivative of the heat generations in the ﬁtting procedure would have the effect of amplifying the small shape changes due to the reversible heat generation which may help the ﬁtting procedure to converge on the global solution. However, the derivative of the heat generation would be a noisy signal and how to properly treat the noise is of critical importance to this method of ﬁtting. Second, by incorpor- ating particle diffusion dynamics into the model, the irreversible heat generation throughout the proﬁle will be more accurate. It can be seen from Fig. 11 that the discharging data shape matches the irreversible heat generation component well. The assumption of uniform lithium concentration in the particle in this technique’s model may be sufﬁcient at beginning of life, but as the cell degrades this assumption becomes less accurate. Therefore, by incorporating lithium diffusion dynamics into the model, the irreversible heat generation may be better predicted meaning the ﬁtting algorithm is more likely to converge on a solution that is the global optimum. Adding lithium diffusion dynamics to the model does however complicate the model signiﬁcantly and reduces the likelihood that this model would be able to run on board. Both potential solutions will be investigated in future works in developing this diagnostic technique further. Finally, the heat generation diagnostic techniques ability to predict LAM and LLI is evaluated. The BOL dataset shown in Fig. 10 is used for the baseline stoichiometric parameters. The degraded parameters predicted by the OCV and heat generation technique datasets are then used in conjunction with Eqs. 10 and 11 to calculate the amounts of LLI and LAM predicted by each dataset. Figure 11. Modelled and measured heat generations for the degraded cells. Discharging left, charging right. C-rate for each row indicated on ﬁgure. Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2021 168 030532 The calculated amounts of LAM and LLI are given in Table VII for the OCV and charging heat generation datasets. Values are given in mAh values as well as their percentage values. The discharge parameters are omitted due to the poor quality of ﬁts as discussed in the previous paragraph. Table VII shows that the predicted amounts of each degradation mode for the heat generation datasets are in good agreement with those predicted by the OCV dataset. In keeping with previous trends, LAMPE and LLI both have very strong performances with an average error of 0.22% and 0.19% respec- tively across all datasets. The average error for LAMNE is higher but still only has an average error of 2% across all datasets. The reason for the prediction of LAMNE having a larger error than the other two degradation modes is exactly the same reason why the negative electrode capacity estimations have a larger error than the positive electrode and offset stoichiometric parameters. Conclusions A zero-dimensional cell heat generation model is developed which can quantitatively diagnose lithium-ion cell degradation modes, including loss of lithium inventory (LLI), loss of active material (LAM), and stoichiometric offset between electrodes. The model can theoretically be used for any current proﬁle and so is suitable for in-operando diagnostics with only 3 ﬁtting parameters. The model does not require impedance modelling, keeping the number of parameters low, but information relating to impedance is preserved by the model and impedance diagnostic techniques can readily be added onto this model. The model works under realistic thermal boundary conditions for tab cooled battery pack designs, and works under load whilst charging and discharging between C/2 to 2C, making it the ﬁrst diagnostic technique capable of quantitatively diagnosing degradation modes in-operando. The model works by comparing estimated heat generation to the measured heat generation and minimising the error to estimate the state-of-health. Heat generation was measured for a tab cooled cell, using the cell cooling coefﬁcient (CCC) concept, to simplify the heat transfer model. This allowed the instantaneous heat generation to be accurately measured under conditions which could be achieved in a real battery pack, also for the ﬁrst time. Other pack conﬁgurations and cooling strategies would require more complex heat transfer models. However, it is believed that tab cooling is optimal for longevity of cells as well as approaching uniform current densities and temperatures. There are also indications that industry is starting to consider how cells should be designed better to allow tab cooling to be the primary method of heat rejection in the near future. The technique was evaluated for a range of load conditions of C/2, 1C & 2C for both charging and discharging. The technique was performed on a fresh cell and provided average errors of less than 1.72%, 2.67% for negative and positive electrode capacities respec- tively and 5.78% for the offset when compared to the state-of-the-art open circuit model-based technique. The tests were then repeated on a degraded cell to calculate the amounts of LAM for both electrodes and LLI. The results showed that under the charging regimes the technique performed excellently, with average errors of 0.18%, 0.22% and 1.99% for LLI, LAMPE and LAMNE respectively. The technique has been shown to work excellently during charging and with improvements in the ﬁtting algorithm it is thought that the performance under discharging regimes can be equally as good. The diagnostic technique is already well suited for applica- tions where constant current charging is used. Similarly, as constant power charging has very slowly changing currents and so it is thought this technique is well suited for constant power charging application also. The technique has been validated up to 2C charging. The technique has the potential to be embedded onto a BMS to frequently diagnose the cell allowing for better predictions of state-of-health (SOH) trends which can be used for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and control interventions.
