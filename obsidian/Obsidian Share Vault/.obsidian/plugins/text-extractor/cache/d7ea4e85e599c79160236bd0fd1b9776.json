This study examines the relationship by separating the cloudless periods and the cloudy periods. The relationship during cloudless skies is well defined and data points fall into a fairly narrow band. When clouds are present, the rela- tionship becomes more complex. First, a method is de- veloped to identify cloudy periods using only GHI data. This is done by correlating GHI with the cosine of the solar zenith angle on clear days and using the difference between the clear sky estimates and measured GHI to identify cloudy periods. Once the cloudy periods have been identified, the relationship between GHI and DNI for cloudy periods is studied. 1. INTRODUCTION Resource assessment requires knowledge of the solar irradiance incident on a collector’s surface. It is imprac- tical to measure this for all possible tilts and orienta- tions, so models have been created to estimate the inci- dent solar radiation. These models utilize the direct normal irradiance (DNI) and diffuse horizontal irradi- ance (DHI) to estimate the total irradiance incident on the collector (GTI). Unfortunately there is a scarcity of DNI and DHI measurements and one often has to rely on total, or more commonly call global, solar radiation on a horizontal surface (GHI). There are probably at least 100 times as many stations measuring GHI as DNI and DHI. Therefore, to calculate solar radiation on a tilted surface, one needs to determine DHI and DNI from GHI measurements. The relationship between global and diffuse irradiance has been the subject of numerous papers [1,2]. Some of the original studies used DHI data from instruments shaded by a shadowband. A correction was needed to estimate the amount of diffuse irradiance blocked by the shadowband, and this correction has a large uncertainty which dimin- ished the accuracy of the models. The advent of automatic trackers with the capability to measure diffuse irradiance utilizing a shade ball provided more accurate diffuse data. It was then discovered that the first class pyranometers used for the GHI and DHI measurements had a thermal offset that skewed the results. In addition, the cosine re- sponse of pyranometers used to measure global irradiance added systematic errors to the reference data. It turned out that the most accurate diffuse measurements are obtained from second class ‘black and white’ type pyranometers mounted on automatic trackers with shade disks or balls blocking direct sunlight. Calculating the GHI by multiply- ing the DNI times the cosine of solar zenith angle and then adding the DHI gives a better estimation of the GHI than using a pyranometer to directly measure the incident solar radiation. This study examines the relationship between GHI and DHI and DNI irradiance. The goal is to characterize the rela- tionship and develop methodologies that can be used to calculate DHI and DNI from GHI measurements. First, the data used in this study is described and then the relationship between GHI, DNI, and DHI is examined. The relationship between GHI and DNI is characterized using one-minute data. The one-minute GHI data is then examined to deter- mine how they can be best be used to calculate DNI. One month of data is used to determine whether improved cal- culations are possible to model DNI from GHI data. The results of the study are then discussed. 2. EXPERIMENTAL DATA The DHI data in this study comes from a Schenk Star py- ranometer mounted in a Schenk ventilator on an automatic tracker. The instrument is cleaned five times per week and the output is recorded by a Campbell Scientific CR 300 data logger. The Schenk Star pyranometer used here was calibrated against an Eppley AHF cavity radiometer for the DNI measurement and an Eppley Precision Spectral Radi- ometer (PSP), thermally adjusted, for the DHI measure- ment. The calibration accuracy at 45º is ±1% or ±2% at a 95% confidence level (see Fig.1). The DNI measurement is from a Kipp and Zonen CHP 1 pyrheliometer that has a ±0.7% uncertainty at the 95% confidence level. GHI val- ues are calculated using Equation 1. GHI= DNI·cos(sza) + DHI Eqn. 1 where sza is the solar zenith angle. The uncertainty of the calculated GHI is ±2% for cloudy skies and about ±1% for clear skies. The data are one-minute data and hourly data can be ob- tained by summing over the appropriate time interval. 3. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GHI AND DHI AND DNI Most studies of GHI divide the global irradiance by the corresponding global extraterrestrial irradiance. The nor- malized value is called the clearness index [kt]. Use of the clearness index helps eliminate systematic variations of the GHI values over the day and over the year by taking into account some of the variation resulting from the changing solar angles over the day and over the year. The clearness index kt will be used in lieu of GHI for parameterizing the relationship with DNI. When it is completely cloudy, DHI values are equal to GHI values. The DHI increases along with GHI values until the clouds become spare, and then the diffuse values decrease. On very sunny days, the DHI values are typically between 10 and 20% of the GHI values. Therefore, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between DHI and GHI. To obtain a one-to-one correspondence, DHI is divided by GHI to yield the diffuse fraction. When it is cloudy, the diffuse fraction is near one because DHI is nearly equal to GHI. However, when GHI is large, DHI is small and the diffuse fraction is small. Fig. 2 is a plot of diffuse fraction verses the clearness index. The data under all weather con- ditions are plotted as black circles and clear sky data are   Fig. 1: Calibration data for a Schenk Star pyranometer.

The clear sky values are clustered in a tight group on the left-hand side of the plot until kt ap- proaches a value of around 0.4. As kt decreases from 0.4 to 0.375, the clear sky diffuse fraction increases from around 0.6 to 1. The data points that occur when the clear sky kt values are below 0.4 occur in the early morning or late afternoon. Note that there are some clearness index values greater than one. These values occur when there is a break in the clouds and the pyranometer receives direct sunlight and DNI irradiance is also reflected off nearby clouds onto the pyranometer. As the averaging time increase, to about 10 minutes, there are no longer kt values greater than one. For hourly averaged data, the maximum value is about 0.8. A complimentary relationship is between GHI parameter- ized as the clearness index (kt) and the clearness index and the clearness index for direct normal beam irradiance (kb) (Fig. 3). kb = DNI/DNIextraterrestrial Eqn. 2 where DNIextraterrestrial is the extraterrestrial direct normal irradiance. Again the clear sky irradiance (the red ’x’s in Fig. 3) is clustered on the left hand side of the plot. At a kt of about 0.4, there is a steep decrease in kb as kt goes to its minimum clear sky value of around 0.375. This is similar characteristics as shown in Fig. 2 with the exception that for kt values greater than 0.4 the relationship between clear sky kb is almost a linear function of kt. Therefore, it is deemed easier to work with the kb kt data than the dif- fuse fraction kt data. The relationship between clear sky GHI and kb is depend- ent on atmospheric aerosols. High quality clear sky mod- els incorporate aerosols and this relationship varies over the year as the aerosol concentrations vary. Any relation- ship will have a seasonal dependence [3] and will change for areas with significantly different aerosol concentra- tions. 3.1 Extracting Information from GHI data Usually only GHI values are available to obtain DNI and knowledge of the characteristics of the GHI data aids in obtaining the most accurate estimates of DNI. Again, the clearness index will be used, and kt will be plotted against the cosine of the solar zenith angle (Fig. 4). The clear sky data are shown as red ‘x’s in Fig. 4 and fall in a tight band along the top of the data points. Therefore, one can then determine a clear sky formula relating kt and the cos(sza). For August, 2011 for Eugene, OR the clear sky relation- ship clearness index values can be obtained from by know- ing the cosine of the solar zenith angle. kt = 0.3276 + 1.4194·x – 1.78262·x2 + 0.836565·x3 Eqn. 3 where x is the cos(sza). The standard error for this fit is ±0.0132. This demonstrates that a clear sky estimates of kt can be obtained with a fair degree of accuracy with only knowledge of the time of day and hence the solar zenith angle. For a comprehensive description of the kt kb relationship, it is necessary to account for the range of the kb values ob- served in Fig. 3 for a give clearness index value. The cor- relation for clear-sky periods is straight-forward. For cloudy periods, the difference between the clear sky values Fig. 4: Plot of clearness index versus cosine of the solar zenith angle. Data for all-weather conditions are plotted as black circles and clear sky data are shown as red ‘x’s. Fig. 5: Plot of clearness index versus cosine of the solar zenith angle.

This is useful information in developing a comprehensive rela- tionship. During period of total cloud cover, kb < 0.01 is assumed here, there little or no direct sunlight. These data are all shown by the red ‘x’s on the lower part (kt < 0.3) of the plot (Fig. 5). An exception occurs when the cosine of the solar zenith angle is very small. The points plotted on the left-hand side of Fig. 5 are associated with times having very small data values where uncertainties are approxi- mately equal to the data values. These are the data points that would fall along the bottom axis of Fig. 3. 3.2 Clear Period Correlation Using just the clear period data a simple correlation be- tween kb and kt can be developed. kb = -0.8589 + 3.6578·kt - 3.6220·kt 2 + 1.9620·kt 3 Eqn. 4 The standard error for this is ±0.0123. As expected, just by identifying the clear sky periods for the GHI irradiance data, a very good correlation can be developed with kb. An alternative approach is to model the clear-period dif- fuse irradiance, Eqn. 1 can be used to obtain the correla- tion in the form of kb = kt - a·f(DHI)/GHIetr Eqn. 5 where f(DHI) is the function that describes DHI as a func- tion of air mass (AM) or other parameters and GHIetr is the extraterrestrial GHI value. For August, 2011, f(DHI)=326.25/AM -615.6/AM 2+676.3/AM 3-302.7/AM 4 and a = 0.9839. Eqns. 6 a & b This gives a slightly better description of kb (see Fig. 6). A correlation with just kt, such as that given in Eqn. 4, would produce a line in Fig. 6 because there is one value of kb for each value of kt. The correlation shown in Eqn. 5 is linear in kt and also depends on a function of the inverse of air mass and the extraterrestrial GHI irradiance. The function f(DHI) matches the values of DHI best early and late in the day, and this time period is showing the widest range of possible kb values near the bottom of Fig. 6. To obtain an accurate model of clear sky DHI, information on the aerosol optical depth would be needed. Aerosols play an important role with any clear sky model and the correlation developed in August does not fit as well for other months with differing aerosol optical depths. For a comparison, Fig. 7 shows the clearness index plotted against the cosine of the solar zenith angle with December data. The estimated clear sky vales are plotted as red ‘x’s utilize the same correlation developed from August data (Eqn. 3) and result in estimated clear sky values that are about 7% lower than actual December values. The dark band above the red ‘x’s are measured December clear day values. The atmospheric aerosols for December are much reduced as compared to August in Eugene and this results in higher clear sky values. Therefore, to improve the clear sky portion of this model and to make the model more universal, inclusion of an aerosol optical depth factor is needed. In the appendix of an earlier work [4] a method is suggested that can incorporate aerosols. This method uses Fig. 6: Plot of measured clear sky data for August in Eu- gene, Oregon (red x’s) plotted against modeled values, using Eqn. 4, that depend on air mass (black circles).

The Link turbidity factor incorporates aerosol in- formation. 3.3 Separating Cloudy Data Estimating kb for partially-cloudy periods is more difficult than estimating kb for clear periods. First, it is necessary to separate cloudy periods from clear-sky periods. Nearly every clear sky data point is within ±0.035 of the modeled clear sky values. Therefore a good starting assumption is that all data values within ±0.035 of the estimated clear sky value are clear sky value. However this assumption allows for cloudy sky values when the GHI values are changing rapidly and the values just happen to be near the clear sky values. The standard deviation of kt over a three- minute period can be used to identify these data as coming from cloudy periods. This is shown in Fig. 8 that plots of the difference between measured clear sky kb values and those calculated for clear sky periods. Data points shown as red ‘x’s have been identified by the standard deviation as coming from cloudy periods. Almost all of the data points in the plot that show a difference between measured and calculated clear sky kb values greater than 0.1, occur when the standard deviation in the clearness index is great- er than 0.01. Whereas the data in Fig. 6 was selected with a visual inspection of the data, the data in Fig. 8 what se- lected by the criterion that kt was within ±0.035 of the clear sky global values. Using the standard deviation of the clearness index to eliminate cloudy periods results in a set of clear sky kb values with a standard uncertainty of only ±0.015. The cloudy sky data can be divided into several categories or conditions. First, in the cases where kt is less than 0.2, kb is always very small. A correlation for this August data yields kb = 0.0145 · kt - 0.0016 Eqn. 7 A second category can be created when the cosine of the solar zenith angle is less than 0.1. A correlation can be created between the difference between kt and kb that is dependent on the difference between the calculated clear sky value of kt and the measured value such that kt-kb = 0.3417 –0.7867*cs + 0.9799*cs2 Eqn. 8 where cs is the difference between the calculated clear sky clearness index given in Eqn. 3 and the measured clearness index (kt). In Fig. 9 kt-kb is plotted against cs. While a correlation can be developed between kt-kb and the difference between the modeled clear sky values and measured clear sky in- dex, the relationship only approximates the average rela- tionship on average. For cs<0, kt-kb=0.1582-0.9263*cs+0.4277*StDev(kt) Eqn. 9 where StDev(kt) is the standard deviation of the data from one minute before the specified time to one minute after it. Use of shorter time intervals seems to yield a better fit for the correlation results. For cs>0, kt-kb=0.1917+1.0651*cs-1.9666*cs 2 Eqn. 10 Fig. 9: Plot of cloudy period data for August 2011 in Eu- gene, OR against difference between clear sky model and measured kt.

The standard deviation for kb during the cloudiest periods is ±0.07 while the overall standard deviation for all August data is closer to ±0.04. August is a fairly clear month in Eugene and the smaller overall standard deviation is indic- ative of the much better fit for clear sky periods. 4. CONCLUSIONS A study of the relationship between the clearness index (kt) and DNI clearness index (kb) has been undertaken using one-minute August, 2011 data from Eugene, Oregon. The relationship has been broken down based on two condi- tions, a clear sky condition and a cloudy sky condition. A methodology for separating the clear sky and cloudy sky conditions has been demonstrated using only information provided by kt and the variation of kt over time. The relationship between kt and kb during clear periods can be described with a reasonable of accuracy (a standard deviation of ±0.017). During cloudy periods the errors are about five times as large. A comparison between the mod- eled results and measured data is shown in Fig. 10. Some of the features of the kt kb relationship are accurately repro- duced, especially for clear periods. For cloudy periods, while the average relationship is reproduced the actual distribution of the data points is not mimicked by the mod- eled data. Dividing the relationship into clear and cloud periods is an improvement over a single formula relating kb to a func- tion of kt. Future studies will attempt to incorporate the effects of aerosol optical depth into the relationships and delve deeper into methods to reproduce the distribution of data point for cloudy periods. 5.
