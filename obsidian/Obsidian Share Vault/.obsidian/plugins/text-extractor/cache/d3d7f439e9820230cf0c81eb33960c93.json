Warranty conditions are complex, and depend on the manufacturer and use case.\r Manual tests and analyses are required to generate transparency on the warranty status.\r Warranty coverage is at risk when the operating strategy is changed.\r Insights into the degradation impact of different operating strategies are limited. Lacking transparency on costs of cycling puts profitability at risk and prevents selection of best strategy.\r Market and regulatory environments are volatile, meaning asset managers must be able to flexibly change operating strategies.\r Challenges Monitor storage KPIs and get precise state of health (SoH) estimations and predictions. Ensure operations & maintenance teams can easily track the health status of all storage systems. \r Identify battery anomalies with proactive notifications so issues can be fixed before turning into safety concerns. \r Manage all warranties with a central contract database. Get notified when your asset’s operating leads to derating of your performance warranty or you are about to breach warranty conditions.\r Utilize an extensive data set on warranty parameters to claim compensation for defective batteries early and from a strong negotiating position.\r Assess impact of any operating profile on the battery’s health to gain full cost transparency and to select the most lucrative operating strategy.\r Set the most profitable operating constraints for your control algorithms based on the assessment of the true cycling costs to boost overall profitability. \r Health & Safety Dashboards Battery Safety Alerting API Integration Warranty Contract Database Scheduled ReportingSolutions solutions for energy storage systems More Value and Less Risk With Energy Storage Systems T WAI C E’s energy solutions enable energy storage system owners to operate storage systems flexibly to achieve best returns whilst protecting warranty coverage and battery health with predictive battery analytics software. © T WAI C E T echnologies GmbH 2022 T WAI C E provides predictive analytics software that optimizes the development and operation of batteries.
