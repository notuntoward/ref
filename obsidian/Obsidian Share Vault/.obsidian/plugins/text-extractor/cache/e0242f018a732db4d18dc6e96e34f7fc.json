Expanding renewable energy is a key pillar to achieve this ambitious target, in which wind energy and PV will play a dominant role. Given their intermittent charac- ter, the high penetration of wind and PV in the power system imposes significant challenges for grid opera- tors and power markets to balance supply and demand. At the same time, decarbonisation of all end use sectors is associated with increasing electrification, which would result in a substantial growth in gross electricity demand and peak demand. Thus, power system flexi- bility is key for achieving climate neutrality in Germany. Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) have emerged as a promis- ing solution here. It is a collection of distributed energy resources (DERs) that are centrally coordinated. DERs consist of small- to medium- scale resources that are connected mainly to the distribution grids or near the end users, including distributed generation, demand- side resources, and energy storage. Despite their poten- tial of flexibility, they are often too small, scattered, and/or their power generation is too fluctuating to di- rectly provide system service. A VPP, acting as an aggre- gator, will bundle these DERs into a sizable portfolio as a single resource. It monitors, forecasts, optimizes, and dispatches their generation, storage/release, or flexible consumption through a central IT system to enable them to participate in power markets and/or deliver the flexibility to system operators. The study 1) offers key insights about the development of VPPs in Germany and its contribution to power sys- tem flexibility, through conducting case studies of VPP business models and analysing the key power market and regulatory framework, in which VPPs are embed- ded; 2) reflects on key enabling factors for VPPs in par- ticular, for its flexibility provision, in Germany. What are the requirements for VPP busi- ness models? • Given the large pool of energy assets, VPP needs an advanced ICT software platform, which allows a large number of DERs to connect. The platform should be able to capture data, enable secure and fast communication between VPP, individual assets, the grid operators, and elec- tricity market, and automatically regulate the DERs to participate in electricity markets and provide grid congestion service. It relies on ad- vanced forecasting algorithms to develop an op- timised dispatch schedule. • Hardware: Real-time data capture from, com- munication with, and controlling of DERs in the portfolio requires smart meters, remote con- trol, and automation systems. • DERs in the portfolio: In order to increase rev- enue, it is important to build a diverse set of DERs (generation, demand, and storage) and ex- plore business opportunities on different markets. Biomass/ biogas power and hydropower plants are considered as indispensable resources for VPPs in Germany due to their high flexibility. Small-scale DERs, such as BEVs, heat pumps, home storage, rooftop PV, will play an increas- ingly important role in flexibility of the future power system. Green hydrogen electrolysis plants can also provide short- and long-term flexibility similarly to biogas power plants. What is the enabling environment for VPPs in Germany? The power market and regulatory framework in Ger- many have created favourable conditions for VPPs to provide flexibility services: • The German government aims to prepare re- newable power plants for the market, in partic- ular, through the direct marketing obligation for medium-sized plants. This created a key service area of VPPs in Germany. In addition, the un- bundling of the vertically integrated power supply system establishes a fundamentally positive environment for new entrants, includ- ing independent VPPs. • The German electricity market allows electric- ity trading close to real-time (intraday market). The shorter lead-time creates additional de- mand for rapidly controllable flexibility 5 available at a short notice, which can be pro- vided by VPPs from their pools. • With the balancing group approach, transmis- sion system operators (TSOs) need to purchase balancing energy from the balancing market, on which VPPs can offer flexibility from the as- sets they aggregate. In addition, a single bal- ancing market enables balancing service pro- viders such as VPPs to provide balancing ser- vices to all TSOs, which increases business op- portunities for VPPs. • The roles, market opportunities, and obliga- tions of aggregators (VPPs) are legally defined in the German energy law. • VPPs’ access to markets: Both European and German regulations ensure VPPs’ access to wholesale and balancing markets. The mini- mum size of bids or conditions for prequalifi- cation to the market is decisive for the pro- spects of VPPs. In Germany, TSOs accept aggre- gation of DERs to be pre-qualified to provide balancing service. VPPs have sufficient freedom to determine the assets in their pools. To further unlock the potential of VPP for providing flexibility to the German power system in the future, the next steps include, among others: • Participation of intermittent renewable energies (in particular, solar PV and wind) and other small-scale DERs in the balancing market should be scaled up beyond pilots. • Additional market design can be considered to facilitate small-scale DERs to offer their flexibility to network operators, because, currently, most local flexibility is not available to the distribu- tion system operators (DSOs) or TSOs and, at the same time, the DER owners have little in- formation about their impact on grid. • Double economic burden from fees, levies and taxes will need to be removed for households to offer their home storage for flexibility. • Standardized processes between independent aggregators, BRPs, consumers will need to be developed, including, e.g. how to settle com- pensation, measurement and validation base- line methodology, data exchange, and govern- ance structure. 6 1 Introduction Germany aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2045. Ac- celerating renewable energy expansion is a key pillar to achieve this ambitious target. In 2020, renewable energy accounted for 50.9% (or 248,82 TWh) of electricity gener- ation in Germany, in which 37.2% (or 183.27 TWh) was generated by wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) 1. It is pro- jected that renewable energy generation will increase to 899 TWh in 2045, in which wind energy and PV will play a dominant role. 2 Given their intermittent character, the high penetration of wind and PV in the power system im- poses significant challenges for grid operators and power markets to balance supply and demand. At the same time, decarbonisation of all end use sectors is associated with increasing electrification, which would result in substan- tial growth in gross electricity demand from 595 TWh in 2018 to 1,017 TWh in 20453 as well as increasing peak de- mand, despite significant energy efficiency efforts that would reduce primary energy demand by more than 50% compared to 2008. Thus, power system flexibility is key for achieving climate neutrality in Germany.4 The study aims to 1) offer key insights about the develop- ment of VPPs in Germany and its contribution to power system flexibility, through conducting case studies of VPP business models operated by different actors and analys- ing the key market regulatory framework, in which VPPs are embedded; 2) reflect on key enabling factors for VPPs in particular, for its flexibility provision, in Germany. Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) have emerged as a promising solution here, by providing flexibility services to the grid and flexibility to the power market. It is a collection of distributed energy resources (DERs) that are centrally coordi- nated. The French utility company EDF estimates the energy aggregation and local flexibility market in Germany at 75 GW and expects a doubling by 2030. 5 DERs consist of small- to medium- scale resources that are connected mainly to the distribution grids or near the end users6. These DERs can be categorized into 1) distributed generation (dispatch- able resources, e.g. CHPs or biogas plants, and variable renewable energy sources, e.g. wind and PV); 2) demand-side resources (demand response from flexible energy users), and; 3) energy storage (e.g. batteries, flywheels, power-to- X). Despite their potential of flexibility, they are often too small, scattered, and/or their power generation is too fluc- tuating to directly provide system service. A VPP, acting as an aggregator, will bundle these DERs into a sizable port- folio as a single resource. It monitors, forecasts, optimizes, and dispatches their generation, storage/release, or flex- ible consumption through a central IT system to enable them to participate in power markets and/or deliver the flex- ibility to system operators. 1 Fraunhofer ISE (2021).

This section briefly presents these regulations, in particular, opportunities and challenges these regulations create for VPP business models. 2.1 Basic principles of German power system Unbundling of the power supply system Unbundling of the traditional, vertically integrated power supply system, i.e. unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution system operation, and supply to final cus- tomers, establishes a fundamentally positive environment for new market entrants and is thus essential for the de- velopment of most VPP business models. In Germany, un- bundling is regulated by the Energy Industry Act (Ener- giewirtschaftsgesetz, EnWG). All energy companies with not less than 100,000 grid customers (§7 EnWG) are re- quired to legally unbundle their grid operation business from the competitive business of generation or supply. This means, transmission system operators (TSO) 7 but also larger distribution system operators (DSO) operate independently from other electricity market players, such as generating companies, traders, suppliers. Smaller com- panies have to have strictly separate accounts for the com- petitive and the grid functions. Consequently, a large share of power is traded on the wholesale market. Balancing The primary goal of power system is to balance overall generation and consumption at all times. In Germany, every producer and consumer is assigned to a balancing group, which is managed by a balancing responsibility party (BRP, often an being energy supplier or also an ag- gregator). A balancing group may include, e.g., power 7 Germany has four TSOs: TransnetBW GmbH, TenneT TSO GmbH, Amprion GmbH, and 50Hertz Transmission GmbH 8 SMARD (n.d.). Balancing energy. https://www.smard.de/page/en/wiki-article/6076/6086 generators or the entire generation and demand of an en- ergy utility. The BRP ensures that the total amount of elec- tricity generated and purchased in the balancing group matches consumption. The BRP must prepare an accurate forecast of its feed-in and withdrawal from the grid for each quarter hour of the following day and submit a sched- ule notification to the responsible TSO. The TSO is respon- sible for maintaining a continuous balance between elec- tricity supply and demand across its area and performs clearing for each balancing group in its area every 15 minutes. It monitors the deviation between the forecast and actual situation of each balancing group and settles the imbalances using the balance service on the balancing market. The BRPs with deviations from the notified sched- ules need to bear the cost of using the balance service, i.e. the balancing energy price 8 . Alternatively, it may be cheaper for the BRPs to purchase or sell power on the in- traday wholesale market to reduce the deviations before the settlement by the TSO9. Dispatch In Germany, power plants determine their own operation schedule in an economically optimal way, based on their costs and anticipated prices on the power market. The pro- ducers of variable renewable energy (VRE), such as wind and solar, sells all generated power due to the lowest mar- ginal costs of VRE and thus cheapest energy source on the merit order list. All decentralized trading among partici- pants on the power market (i.e. day-ahead and intra-day, see Section 2.2) needs to be submitted to the TSO in the form of schedule. The outcome of trading determines the 9 Ninomiya, Y., Schröder,J. and Thomas, S.(2019). Digitalization and the Energy Transition: Virtual Power Plants and Block- chain.Study for the GJETC 8 allocation of resources in the power system, i.e. the dis- patch of supply and demand-side technologies. After the closure of power trading, the TSOs use balancing market to settle real time imbalance (see Section 2.2). In the case of grid congestion, the system operators have access to power plants to adjust electricity feed-in (Section 2.4). 2.2 Power markets and market regulations Trading in the German electricity market exchange con- sists of three products based on different periods of time between purchase and actual delivery. Long-term trading takes place on the futures market and can start several years before actual delivery, based on long-term forecasts and estimation. Buyers use it to hedge against the risk of rising prices. The majority of electricity trading is short-term, carried out on the EPEX spot market. Short-term trading first takes place in the day-ahead market, where bids can be made no later than 12:00 at noon for a given hour in the following day, resulting in a more accurate forecasting on generation and consumption than the futures market. Once bids are accepted, electricity suppliers plan the acti- vation of their power plants and pass the plan to the re- sponsible TSOs in the form of schedules by 14:30 the day before. Forecast deviations from the day-ahead result are offset on the intraday market, 15-minutes-products and 1– hour–products can be traded until 5 minutes before deliv- ery (reduced from the previous 45 minutes). The continu- ous intraday bids are accepted on the order book principle, i.e. there is a separate price for each successful trade, in- stead of a uniform price. Cross-border intraday trading (XBID), which aims to create a single pan European cross zonal intraday market in Europe, was introduced in 2018. The XBID solution is based on a common IT system with one Shared Order Book (SOB), a Capacity Management Module (CMM) and a Shipping Module (SM).10 The intra- day market is gaining importance due to the increasing penetration of intermittent renewables, as it responds to the deviations due to the updated BRP forecasts of the load and renewable energy generation11. In Germany, VPPs have been active in both the day-ahead and intraday markets. Besides, the shorter lead time in the intraday market cre- ates additional demand for rapidly controllable flexibility available at a short notice, which can be offered by VPPs from their pools. After the closing of intraday market trading, the TSO pro- cures the balancing service on the balancing power market to settle the real-time imbalance between supply and de- mand at the system level and its resulting frequency devi- ations. It was only until 2010 that a single balancing mar- ket was established, in which balancing service providers can offer their flexibility to all TSOs 12. The maintenance of frequency can be achieved through the use of different types of balancing reserves: Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR, also known as primary control reserve) and Fre- quency Restoration Reserve with automatic and manual ac- tivation (aFRR, also known as secondary reserve, and mFRR, also as tertiary reserve). Their activation time ranges from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. The minimum bids for FCR is 1MW. Bids for FCR must be symmetric, i.e. bids offer the same capacity in both positive and negative di- rections13. The providers of FCR products will only be re- warded with the capacity price (for the willingness to re- serve balancing capacity for a certain amount of time). In contrast, aFRR and mFRR are tendered separately for pos- itive and negative reserves with a minimum bid size of 5 MW each. The provision of aFRR and mFRR is remunerated with a capacity price and a balancing energy price (billing for the balancing energy that is actually used, which is passed on to BRPs who cause the activation). 10 https://www.amprion.net/Energy-Market/Congestion-Manage- ment/Multi-Regional-Coupling-(MRC)-and-Cross-Border-Intra- day-(XBID)/Content-Page.html 11 Beucker, S. Et al. (2020). WindNODE-summary report: flexibil- ity, markets and regulation 12 Previously, imbalance was handled independently by each of the four TSOs. 13 Positive balancing services are provided through increase generation or reduce consumption, whereas negative balancing services are provided by decreasing genera- tion or increasing consumption. 9 Table 1: Features of three balancing energy products FCR aFRR mFRR Time to activate 30 seconds 5 minutes 15 minutes Minimum bid size 1 MW (positive and nega- tive) 5 MW* (positive or nega- tive) 5 MW* (positive or nega- tive) Remuneration Capacity price Capacity price + energy price Capacity price + energy price * 1MW can also be submitted if only one offer is submitted per product per TSO control zone In Germany, VPPs are active in the balancing power mar- ket, in particular, aFRR and mFRR. A VPP aggregates dif- ferent DERs in its pool for participating in balancing mar- ket, as TSOs in Germany accept pre-qualification at the ag- gregated pool level. Previously, for delivering balancing energy, the provider had to participate in a capacity auction, in which VPPs ag- gregating flexible loads often could not participate due to forecasting challenges 14. Since November 2020, any pre- qualified providers, regardless of their prior participation in a capacity auction, can deliver balancing energy15. 2.3 Ordinance on Interruptible Load Agree- ments (AbLaV) The Ordinance on Interruptible Load Agreements (AbLaV), which entered into force in 2013 and was amended in 2016, allows TSOs to tender their demand for interruptible loads. It was introduced to incentivise industry to provide flexi- bility due to the small volume of interruptible loads avail- able on balancing market at that time. Accordingly, inter- ruptible loads can participate either in balancing power market or in TSOs’ tendering under the AbLaV. Until 2016, the AbLaV only addressed energy-intensive industry, 14 Poplavskayaa,K. and Vries,L.(2019). Distributed energy re- sources and the organized balancing market: A symbiosis yet? Case of three European balancing markets. Energy Pol- icy 126: 264–276 15 BNetzA(2019). Einführung eines Regelarbeitsmarktes. https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemit- teilungen/DE/2019/20191008_Regelenergiemarkt.html which resulted in not more than seven contracts 16 . The amended AbLaV in 2016 attempted to increase both the number of providers and the competition by relaxing the preconditions of participation. For example, the size of minimum bids is reduced from 50MW to 5 MW. Besides, participation of DERs at the medium voltage grid and ag- gregation of smaller loads are allowed. According to the AbLaV, the TSOs issue weekly tenders for 750 MW each of immediately interruptible loads (SOL) and quickly interruptible loads (SNL) through the TSOs' joint tendering platform17. The consumers are compensated by both availability (capacity-based) and actual activation (energy-based). Payments for availability are based on the outcome of a competitive auction and limited to max €500/MW per week and payments for activations are lim- ited to max €400/ MWh (§4 AbLaV). During the activation, the signal is sent by the TSO either to the consumers di- rectly or via a VPP. The amended AbLaV creates opportu- nities for smaller consumers, in particular, those from the service sector, as well as a business opportunity for VPPs in addition to their previous service for industrial users to market their interruptible loads. 16 Wohlfarth K.and Klobasa,M.(2019). Setting course for demand response in the service sector. Energy Efficiency 12:327–341 17 https://www.regelleistung.net/ext/static/abla?lang=en The im- mediately interruptible loads (SOL) must be activated less than1 second (typically 350ms). Quickly interruptible loads (SNL) can be activated by TSO within 15 minutes 10 2.4 Grid congestion management One core idea of the German electricity market design \"Electricity Market 2.0\" is the separation between power markets and grid congestion management. While the elec- tricity wholesale market with a large price zone forms price signals, it does not fully take into account the physi- cal transport capacity of the grid system. The management of domestic grid congestion takes place outside the market 18. The system operators (currently the TSOs) can take a cascade of measures to eliminate grid congestion, accord- ing to the law (EnWG and EEG): ● TSOs conduct load flow analysis for the next day based on the notification submitted by BRPs. They forecast if and to what extent the dispatch on the wholesale market will negatively impact any parts of the grid. In case of grid congestion, TSOs can call on redispatch (EnWG §13 para. 1), i.e. instructing plant operators in one place to reduce their feed-in, which is originally dispatched on the wholesale market, and operators in another place to increase their output19. Redispatch thus forms the interface between electric- ity trading on the wholesale market and the physical challenges of the grid infrastructure 20 . Until now, participation is mandatory for conventional power plants with a capacity greater than 10 MW. In case that the plants are instructed to shift their feed-in, they are compensated for the incurred costs and lost revenues. ● If redispatch of conventional power plants is not suf- ficient, TSOs can take the emergency measure for further adjustments of electricity feed-in (i.e. feed-in management), which affects renewable electricity and CHPs (e.g. curtailment of renewables). This comes as the last option for congestion management, as renewable electricity has a feed-in priority. From 1 October 2021, the amended Grid Expansion Accel- eration Act (NABEG) will come into force, which specifies 18 Hirth, L.et al.(2019). Cost- or market-based? Future redis- patch procurement in Germany 19 Depending on how quickly a plant can provide redispatch, TSOs can request for redispatch between seven days in advance to in real time. 20 BMWi (2019). Electricity Market:A modern electricity mar- ket. https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Dossier/electri- city-market-of-the-future.html measures for reforming grid congestion management, in- cluding Redispatch 2.0. With the amendments, plants with a capacity not less than 100 kW and all DSOs will also be obliged to participate in redispatch. It means that much more capacity will be included in redispatch21. First, it low- ers the minimum size for participating in redispatch, i.e., from 10MW to 100kW. As a consequence, a new market role, the “deployment manager”, is introduced. A plant operator of a controllable resource can assign its redis- patch related responsibilities to a deployment manager. The deployment manager is then responsible for the de- ployment of controllable resources.22 Each controllable re- source is assigned to exactly one resource manager (Az. BK6-20-059). Second, it allows TSOs and DSOs to also re- dispatch renewable electricity and CHP plants, still, redis- patch for conventional power plants will occur first. How- ever, the amendment does not address the potential of flexible and connectible loads from consumers. Redis- patch 2.0 includes two alternative compensation models: a) forecast model, the grid operator forecasts plant opera- tion without requiring information from the specific plant operator. The compensation for reduced feed-in will be calculated based on the forecast; b) planned value model, the plant operator – or the deployment manager – needs to transmit the planning data for compensation calcula- tion. In both cases, for calculating the compensation, the plant operators are obliged to transmit meteorological data (for wind and PV) to the grid operators23. The possible participation of renewable plants, the newly introduced role of “deployment manager”, and communication re- quirements in Redispatch 2.0 thus creates a new business opportunity for VPP operators. 2.5 Renewable energy regulations The amended Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) in 2012 introduced ‘direct marketing’ for electricity from renewa- bles as an optional alternative to the fixed feed-in tariff (FiT). Under ‘direct marketing’ as defined by the law, the renewable generators sell electricity on the wholesale 21 BMWi (2020). Bericht des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Energie nach § 63 Absatz 2a EnWG 22 BDEW (2021). Rollenmodell für die Marktkommunikation im deutschen Energiemarkt. Arbeitsgrundlagen Marktkommunika- tion, at p. 11. 23 Nextkraftwerke(n.d.) Redispatch 2.0 https://www.next-kraft- werke.de/virtuelles-kraftwerk/redispatch-2-0 11 market. They then receive the selling price on the market and a ‘market premium’ i.e. the difference between the so- called ‘value to be applied’ 24 and the average monthly wholesale (day-ahead) market price. The EEG amendment in 2014 made direct marketing obligatory for all new re- newable electricity installations above 100kW. Further- more, biogas installations additionally receive a capacity- oriented flexibility supplement, for example, newly in- stalled flexible capacities receive a flexibility supplement of up to 65 EUR/kW per year (§50a EEG 2021). Conse- quently, medium-sized renewable power producers above 100 kW are motivated to connect to VPPs for selling power on the wholesale market. The resulted increasing number of plants connected to the VPP significantly improve the business opportunities of German VPPs and also enables the VPPs to expand their key activities, e.g. by providing to these plants the service of participating in balancing power market. 2.6 Aggregator regulations With increasing penetration of renewable energies in the power systems, favourable regulations for VPPs have been created both at European level and in Germany. Although the concept of VPPs has not been legally defined yet, it is comparable to the legal definition of “aggregators”.25 At the European level, the term “aggregator” was firstly legally defined in 2012 as a service provider for load man- agement (2012/27/EU, Art. 2 No. 45). The Clean Energy for All Europeans Package in 2019 is claimed to be a real boost to aggregators. 26 In the European regulation (EU/ 2019/943) and directive (EU/2019/944) on common rules for the internal market for electricity, aggregation is de- fined more precisely27 and the different opportunities for 24 Since EEG 2017, new solar and wind energy plants on land with an installed capacity of 750 kW or more and biomass plants with an installed capacity of 150 kW or more have to participate in auctions. The plant operator bids on the ‘value to be applied’ of a plant in cents per kWh. Plant operators who were successful in an auction receive the proposed ‘value to be applied’ for the next 20 years (‘pay-as-bid procedure’). 25 Antoni, J., et al. (2020). Netzstabilität im Stromsystem aus insti- tutionenökonomischer und rechtlicher Perspektive – Einführung in die Problemstellung und systematischer Überblick, at p. 31. 26 Poplavskayaa,K. and Vries,L.(2020). Aggregators today and to- morrow: from intermediaries to local orchestrators? in Sioshansi, F.(eds) Behind and Beyond the Meter Digitalization, Aggregation, Optimization, Monetization. Academic Press, at p. 106. aggregators to participate in the energy market are out- lined. Aggregators can participate in all balancing markets and provide the corresponding services (2019/943, Art. 6 & 7). Importantly, Article 17 (2019/944) also requires Mem- ber States to ensure that TSOs and DSOs, when procuring ancillary services, treat aggregators of demand response in a non-discriminatory manner. Current regulations in Germany provide VPPs with suffi- cient freedom to determine the DERs in their pool, in terms of the number and types of units (renewable energy plants28, flexible loads, storage, etc.), which allows them to provide various balancing services. In Germany, aggrega- tors are authorized to bundle resources from several bal- ancing groups in a single pool 29. This enables them to sub- stantially expand their pools and improve their business case while lowering transaction costs. They are also al- lowed to be active in both the wholesale market and the balancing market, as illustrated in section 2.2. On the other hand, independent VPPs, who are not affiliated to the cus- tomer's supplier30, need to ensure that energy feed-in and withdrawals are duly notified and to obtain an explicit au- thorization from the BRP. This may represent a barrier for VPPs: a) BRPs may not want to risk increasing their port- folio imbalances, because aggregators’ pooling of energy resources from their consumers would change their schedule and thus lead to additional imbalance costs 31;b) BRPs, often the utilities, are potential competitors for ag- gregation services. Another major barrier that impedes the development of independent aggregators is an overall lack of standardized processes and contracts between inde- pendent aggregators, BRPs, and consumers/prosumers, which results in high transaction costs32. The Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) proposed an “Ag- gregator-Model” in 2016 and initiated a stakeholder 27 Aggregation refers to “a function performed by a natural or le- gal person who combines multiple customer loads or generated electricity for sale, purchase or auction in any electricity market” 28 Renewable energy units are mainly biomass, because par- ticipation of intermittent renewable energy, such as PV and wind, in balancing market, though not prohibited, is still in test phase (Poplavskaya and Vries,2019) 29 Poplavskaya and Vries (2019) 30 ‘ EU 2019/944 31 Poplavskayaa,K. and Vries,L.(2020). 32 Wohlfarth and Klobasa (2019) 12 process to discuss the proposal with relevant market ac- tors. The process led to an industry guideline (BNetzA Az. BK6-17-046), including, among others, a definition of the “Aggregator” as a market role. Last but not least, in July 2021, aggregators’ roles, market opportunities and obliga- tions are legally defined in the German energy law 33. 2.7 Regulations and preconditions for resi- dential DERs to provide flexibility Storage as flexibility sources In Germany, households (and consequently their flexibil- ity resources) are classified as final customers by the En- ergy Industry Law (EnWG) and are thus obligated to pay when withdrawing as well as storing electricity from the grid (levies and taxes34) and feeding into the grid (the con- cession fee, grid usage fees and electricity tax). Storage that is exclusively used for storing and feeding in electric- ity to the grid can be exempted from taxes and grid fees35. Since home storage systems are usually used to optimise self-consumption, they are mostly not eligible for this ex- emption36. Such a double burden makes it unprofitable for households to offer their home storage or their battery electric vehicle for flexibility today, even if they had a smart meter. Smart meters Smart meters enable communication between consumers, producers, prosumers, suppliers, and a smart grid, thereby allowing for intelligent management and automation of both supply and network. Thus, smart meters are a key in- frastructure to tap the households’ potential for flexibility provision. In Germany, TSOs are obliged to install smart meters for end users with electricity consumption between 6000 and 100,000 kWh/year (BMWi, 2020). Due to strong data protection regulations and the need to develop safe data transmission technologies, the rollout started only in early 2020 and is aimed to be completed by 2032. Recently, the EEG (2021) obligates 1) PV plants with a capacity of more than 7 kWp to install a smart meter and to communi- cate how much electricity they feed into the grid; 2) PV plants with more than 25 kWp to be remotely controllable. These new rules are expected to accelerate the smart meter roll-out. 33 On July 16, 2021 in the “Act to implement EU requirements and regulate pure hydrogen networks in energy law”. 34 They were previously also subject to renewable sur- charges and are now exempted. 35 According to EnWG and Electricity Tax Act (StromStG) 36 Schönfisch M., et al.

As outlined in Chapter 2, due to the direct marketing introduced by the EEG, a first major business for VPP operators in Germany was to sell the power produced by medium-sized renewable energy plants above 100 kW in the wholesale market as required by the direct marketing, and this allowed to pool these plants to a VPP and offer to optimise the selling of their power in the day-ahead market. In addition, VPPs also facilitate energy units with high flexibility, such as biomass and hydro power plants, to profit from the intraday mar- ket and the balancing market. Nowadays, in addition to renewable energy plants, VPPs also include gas-fired CHP, battery storage, emergency generators, and demand response in their portfolio. According to its operators, VPPs in Germany can broadly be categorized to three types: • Independent VPP operators, which are not affili- ated to the conventional customer's supplier. They can also act as supplier (currently mainly large customers above 100 kW) and thus BRP. • Large utilities (multi-national, regional, and mu- nicipal) pooling their own generation assets and possibly their customers’ loads and generation to a VPP. As utilities, they are also BRP; • Niche actors, in particular, manufacturers of small-scale DERs, which mainly aggregate DERs of their customers to a VPP. Table 2 illustrates examples of active VPPs in each category and their key activities. Since the prices for aFRR and mFRR service have dropped during recent years, mainly “low- hanging fruit” have been included in VPPs’ offers to these services, i.e. CHP (natural gas and biogas/biomass), non- CHP biogas/biomass, and some storage facilities37.

Überblick über aktive Aggregatoren in Deutschland. Independent VPP Utility VPP Niche VPP 14 The following sections present selected case studies of VPPs initiated by the above-mentioned three types of op- erators in Germany. 3.1 VPP business model by independent aggregators Next Kraftwerke (NEXT) was established in 2009. It is among the earliest and one of the largest European VPPs, which has aggregated 11,049 units with a networked ca- pacity of 9,016MW39. They include biogas plants, CHP, hy- dropower, PV, battery storage, power-to-gas, EV, indus- trial loads for demand response. NEXT’s aggregation ser- vice is enabled by their control system, using an intelligent algorithm based on a large number of data (e.g. plant op- eration, weather, price signals on the market, grid) to make renewable generation and industrial users more flexible and responsive to price signals. The system a) en- ables communication between NEXT, individual assets, the TSO, and the power exchange; b) creates individual schedules for the assets and automatically regulates them. Their key activities related to flexibility include: ● Adjusting to the signals on intraday market The intraday market is an essential tool to balance the overall system. NEXT adjusts the dispatchable energy gen- eration (e.g. biogas plants) and loads in its portfolio to op- erate toward the varying electricity price on the market, resulting in revenue for the DER owners while contributing to system balancing. Taking the example of a biogas plant connected to NEXT, its power generation is controlled in a 15-minute interval via the Next Box and adjusted up and down as often as 20 times a day, based on current prices on the wholesale market to optimise revenue for power gen- eration40. To encourage load shifting of their industrial and com- mercial clients, NEXT offers them different types of tariff, taking into account varying electricity price on the intra- day market (the set-up of the tariff depends on, e.g. the time of use, how flexible the user can adjust their produc- tion schedule). The choice of the tariff depends on the flex- ibility of consumers. Consumers can decide to implement the schedules themselves according to the price signals 39 https://www.next-kraftwerke.com/company 40 Lehmbruck,L. et al.(2020).Aggregation of front- and behind-the- meter: the evolving VPP business model. in Sioshansi, F.(eds)Be- hind and Beyond the Meter Digitalization, Aggregation, Optimiza- tion, Monetization.Academic Press sent by the NEXT or be fully automatically regulated by NEXT41. ● Providing balancing service by its aggregated assets NEXT has been active on all three balancing markets. By mid 2021, NEXT has aggregated 2,780MW of assets to pro- vide balancing service (75 MW FCR, 983 MW aFRR, 1,762 MW mFRR)42 . Individual asset owners generate revenues through participating in the balance market (capacity price and energy price introduced in Section 2.1). NEXT takes a share of the revenue. ● Supporting marketing interruptible loads NEXT also supports consumers with constant load profile from the industrial and service sector in marketing their interruptible loads through providing marketing service and prequalification service. ● Help BRPs to reduce the risk of deviations within their balancing group and to avoid thus associated payment. o Supporting BRPs in balancing group manage- ment, e.g., quarter-hourly balancing group management, energy data management, and communication with TSO. NEXT can take over balance management completely or partly. o Supporting BRPs in portfolio management through first optimising generation and con- sumption forecasts and then settling the de- viation between forecast and realised sched- ules in the following day through electricity trading on intraday market. ● Supporting plant operators in providing flexibility un- der Redispatch 2.0 Under Redispatch 2.0, various data need to be transmitted to the grid operator for forecasting and compensation cal- culation. NEXT will act as a deployment manager for the plant operators, which close contract with them for direct marketing, and will transmit required data to system op- erators. ● Software-as-service Except for operating VPP, NEXT also offers a customizable VPP (NEMOCS) as a software solution for energy firms to build their own VPP. Besides, they provide software (NEX- TRA) for utilities’ balance group management. 41 https://www.next-kraftwerke.de/virtuelles-kraftwerk/stromver- braucher 42 NRW.Invest (2021). Joint Venture Toshiba ESS - Next Kraftwerke 15 Furthermore, the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) creates new opportunities for VPPs. NEXT recently joined a research project, which aims to enable the provision of balancing services by batteries in electric automated guided vehicles (AGV) at the Hamburg shipping port. In the project, NEXT has developed concepts for the fleet’s prequalification to provide control reserve as well as the charging system of the AGV that connects to VPP and trades the control reserve power. The project has also de- veloped a prognosis algorithm enable the AGV to provide control reserve while ensuring logistical operations 43. 3.2 VPP business model by municipal, re- gional, and multi-national utilities Generally speaking, German utilities are composed of five very large energy utilities “big 5”(E.ON SE, Uniper, EnBW AG, RWE AG, Vattenfall GmbH) with a number of regional DSO and supply subsidiaries and about 900 small and me- dium-sized municipal utilities (so-called Stadtwerke). The former are mostly multi-national companies and have dominated power generation; the latter are mostly owned by municipalities and provide local basic public service in- cluding energy supply and services. In comparison to in- dependent VPPs with competent (Information and Com- munication Technology) ICT or energy management tech- nology knowhow but no own DER assets, utilities’ VPPs have their own energy assets, for example, CHP plants, which can provide high flexibility. More and more large heat storage tanks have been installed to increase the flex- ibility of CHP plants (decoupling power generation from feeding heat into the district heating network according to heat demand), often in combination with immersion elec- tric heaters in order to be able to use power for heat gener- ation when power exchange prices are very low or even negative. The CHP plants can thus be used for maximising revenue in the day-ahead market, optimization in intraday trading on the power exchange, and for providing services on the balancing market. Furthermore, as BRPs, utilities can use the flexibility of CHP plants for balancing group optimization, i.e. ramping power generation up and down 43 Lehmbruck, et al.(2020). 44 Ninomiya et al. (2019) 45 E.ON (2020). E.ON and thyssenkrupp bring hydrogen produc- tion on the electricity market. https://www.eon.com/en/about- us/media/press-release/2020/2020-06-30-e-on-and- thyssenkrupp-bring-hydrogen-production-on-the-electricity- market.html. to meet demand of the electricity customers in real time enabled by the heat storage. This will allow them to avoid purchasing or selling power in the intraday market or to pay for balancing energy 44. More recently, utilities have started to explore the potential of their customer loads with VPPs in addition to generation assets. In the follow- ing, two recent examples of such VPP pilots are presented. EON, one of the “big5”, has developed a VPP, marketing the electricity and flexibility of 150 plants (600 MW) in Germany and the U.K45. The VPP includes power generation units (CHPs, gas and steam turbines, emergency power generators, wind power plants), energy consumers (in- dustrial loads, pumps, power-to-heat), and storages (e.g. batteries). E.ON provides consumers with ICT devices in order to remotely manage the plants and optimize the plants’ revenue as well as to enable them participating in the different balancing markets without negatively influ- encing their core business (e.g. in the case of industrial loads)46. In cooperation with thyssenkrupp, the largest flat steel producer in Germany, E.ON now includes a thyssenkrupp electrolysis plant for green hydrogen pro- duction to its VPP portfolio. The plant can increase and de- crease its production quickly to provide flexibility. Through the connection to E.ON’s VPP, the plant provides primary control reserve (FCR) on the balancing market47 . Green hydrogen will support the decarbonization of energy intensive industrial processes and provide seasonal bal- ancing in the future (Prognos et al. 2021). In case renewa- ble energy production surpasses energy demand, large- scale electrolysis plants can use the energy to produce hy- drogen. In this way, green hydrogen generation can con- tribute to power system stability. At the same time, the participation in the balancing market also brings addi- tional revenue and thus enhances economic viability of green hydrogen. The municipal utility WSW recently completed a research project of VPP development48. The project focused on the flexibility of private households. Smart meters were in- stalled for 500 private households, providing them with a minute-by-minute overview of their individual 46 E.ON (2021).

VPP Forschungsprojekt “WSW: Wuppertal spart Watt”. https://www.wsw-online.de/wuppertalspartwatt/. 16 consumption. The households were then incentivized to shift loads to times when there is a high level of renewable energy production in the system. They received signals (red, yellow, green) on a two-hourly-basis, indicating whether the use of electricity is currently more beneficial or more problematic, and had to react manually. Three pa- rameters were used for this assessment: day-ahead mar- kets, local energy supply, and grid stability. 49 The five “best” consumers were awarded with free electricity sup- ply for one year. In a third step, WSW, in cooperation with the local University, evaluated the technical and social- economical impacts of this trial. Results show that one third of the participants’ load profiles were adjusted to the signals to a certain extent and load shifting of up to 23% was realized.50 The example shows that local grid balance can be improved with comparatively simple technological means and information and incentive mechanism for con- sumers. However, cutting-edge ICT software and hard- ware are necessary to enable consumers to participate in balancing markets via VPPs. 3.3 VPP business models by niche actors Given the potential of DERs for flexibility provision, man- ufacturers of these DERs, such as home battery storage, heat pumps, battery electric vehicles (BEVs), have also launched VPPs by pooling their customers’ DERs. Sonnen is a home battery provider. It initiated a commu- nity among the owners with a PV system and Sonnen bat- tery, who can share self-produced electricity with other community members through a virtual energy pool. The members are virtually and intelligently connected to each other through a blockchain-based centralized software platform and individual smart meters. They can feed sur- plus electricity into the community or draw the electricity they need from it. The sonnenCommunity eventually be- comes a VPP. All members who make their sonnenBatter- ies available to provide balancing service, i.e. short-term 49 Hobert, A., et al. (2021).

Sonnen to provide primary balancing power to German grid from networked home storage https://www.pv-magazine.com/2018/12/05/sonnen-to-provide- primary-balancing-power-to-german-grid-from-networked- home-storage/ temporary storage, will receive free electricity up to certain amount, depending on the tariff package. In 2018, Sonnen VPP with a size of 1MW was prequalified by Germany's largest transmission system operator TenneT to partici- pate in balancing market. The goal was to expand it into 100MW in the near future51. In addition, sonnen batteries had successfully implemented the Germany-wide redis- patch in a project with TenneT. When there is an oversup- ply of wind energy and grids cannot transport it to where it is needed, the electricity will be stored in the sonnen bat- teries within the VPP. In order to achieve climate neutrality by 2045, heat pumps are expected to grow significantly due to their high effi- ciency and decarbonisation potentials. Prognos et al. cal- culate that six million heat pumps will need to be installed by 2030 and 14 million by 2045.52 While heat pumps may increase electricity consumption, it is at the same time a flexible resource. Heat pumps used in energy efficient buildings can be turned off for several hours without af- fecting thermal comfort. ewi ER&S estimates that heat pumps can reduce demand peaks of single households by up to 50% without compromising comfort, thus providing substantial potential for load shifting and demand peak reduction.53 Germany’s leading heating and cooling solu- tion provider Viessmann and TenneT recently launched the ViFlex pilot, in which they will test how to utilise the potential flexibility of heat pumps for grid congestion management and to form a VPP consisting of heat pumps (with their heat storage tanks) and electricity storages. Viessmann will synchronise heat pumps of their consum- ers with TenneT's grid management requirements through an app they developed to maximize customers’ comfort and efficiency54. 52 Prognos, Öko-Institut, Wuppertal-Institut (2021). 53 ewi Energy Reseachr & Scenarios gGmbH (2018).

More recently, VPP pilots have been launched to optimise supply and demand at the medium- and low-voltage grid. Under Redispatch 2.0, VPP operators are also ready to take the role as a deployment manager to support their renewable plant operators in providing flex- ibility to address grid congestion. Through providing flexibility, VPPs can thus support re- newable energy expansion and increasing electrification, not to mention, the core business of VPPs in Germany is to support direct marketing of renewable energy. At the same time, flexibility provided by VPPs can potentially avoid building new peak generating capacity as well as expand- ing grids and thus reduce investments in power system in- frastructure while bringing new revenue for owners of DERs. In the following, the key enabling factors for VPP develop- ment and its flexibility provision in Germany are summa- rised. 4.1 Requirements for VPP business models Technical requirements: ● Given the large pool of energy assets, VPP needs an advanced ICT software platform, which allows a large number of DERs to connect. The platform should be able to capture data (e.g. plant operation, meteorolog- ical data, price signals on the market, grid situation), enable secure and fast communication between VPP, in- dividual assets, the TSO, and electricity market, and automatically regulate the DERs to participate in elec- tricity markets and provide grid congestion service. It relies on advanced forecasting algorithms to develop an optimised dispatch schedule. ● Hardware: Real-time data capture from, communica- tion with, and controlling of DERs in the portfolio re- quires smart meters, remote control, and automation systems. DERs in the portfolio: ● In order to increase revenue, it is important to build a diverse set of DERs (demand, supply, and storage) and explore business opportunities on different markets. Bio- mass/ biogas power and hydropower plants are consid- ered as indispensable resources for VPPs in Germany due to their high flexibility. Small-scale DERs, such as BEVs, heat pumps, home storage, rooftop PV, will play an increasingly important role in flexibility of the future power system. Yet their potentials have not yet been tapped due to the slow rollout of smart meters and regulatory barriers. Green hydrogen electrolysis plants can also provide short- and long-term flexibility sim- ilarly to biogas power plants. Both VPPs and grid op- erators in Germany have acknowledged the potential of these DERs and have launched a number of experi- ments, in which DERs not only participate in electric- ity market but also provide flexibility to address grid congestion (VPP in cooperation with TSOs) and bal- ance at the distribution grid level (municipal utilities’ own VPPs). ● Another key factor of successful VPP operation is to actively motivate owners of these diverse DERs to con- nect to VPPs and participate in flexibility provision, through fair and transparent economic incentives (e.g. time-dependent prices) and awareness-raising and information provision (e.g. NEXT have a large glossary to explain all key concepts related to their service). 4.2 Enabling environment for VPPs in Ger- many The power market and regulatory framework in Germany have created favourable conditions for VPPs to provide flexibility services: ● The German government aims to prepare renewable power plants for the market, in particular, through the direct marketing obligation for medium-sized plants. This created a key service area of VPPs in Germany. In addition, the unbundling of the vertically integrated power supply system established a fundamentally positive environment for new entrants, including in- dependent VPPs. 18 ● The German electricity market allows electricity trad- ing close to real-time (intraday market). The shorter lead-time creates additional demand for rapidly con- trollable flexibility available at a short notice, which can be provided by VPPs from their pools. ● With the balancing group approach, TSOs need to pur- chase balancing energy from the balancing market, on which VPPs can offer flexibility from the assets they aggregate. In addition, a single balancing market ena- bles balancing service providers such as VPPs to pro- vide balancing services to all TSOs, which increases business opportunities for VPPs. ● The roles, market opportunities and obligations of ag- gregators (VPPs) are legally defined in the German en- ergy law. ● VPPs’ access to markets: Both European and German regulations ensure VPPs’ access to wholesale and bal- ancing markets. The minimum size of bids or condi- tions for prequalification to the market is decisive for the prospects of VPPs: if the minimum size is too high or prequalification is too strict or even excludes some types of DERs, this will limit the possibilities of VPPs to participate. In Germany, TSOs accept aggregation of DERs to be pre-qualified to provide balancing service. VPPs have sufficient freedom to determine the assets in their pools, in terms of numbers and types of DERs (balancing service provided by intermittent renewable energy generators, such as PV and wind, is still in its test phase). Minimum bid sizes were reduced in the past to 1 MW, but could be reduced further. To further unlock the potential of VPP for providing flexi- bility to the German power system in the future, the fol- lowing seems necessary: ● Participation of intermittent renewable energies (in par- ticular, solar PV and wind) and other small-scale DERs in the balancing market should be scaled up beyond pi- lots. ● Additional market design can be considered to facilitate small-scale DERs to offer their flexibility to network op- erators, because, currently, most local flexibility is not available to the DSOs or TSOs and, at the same time, the DER owners have little information about their impact on grid. A prominent solution could be the es- tablishment of regional flexibility market, serving as an independent trading platform between DERs and DSO network operators. VPP operators will have new op- portunities from this development through bundling offers from DERs in such a market than just requiring DSOs to offer reduced tariffs to flexible consumers, which is discussed as an alternative or in addition to such markets. ● Double economic burden from fees, levies and taxes will need to be removed for households to offer their home storage for flexibility. ● Standardized processes between independent aggrega- tors, BRPs, consumers will need to be developed, in- cluding, e.g. how to settle compensation, measure- ment and validation baseline methodology, data ex- change, and governance structure. 19 www.energypartnership.cn Website Wechat","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
