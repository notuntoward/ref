Unsure of how Air Canada's bereavement rates worked, Moffattasked Air Canada's chatbot to explain.Enlarge Alvin Man | iStock Editorial / Getty Images PlusASHLEY BELANGERSUBSCRIBESIGN IN 5/1/24, 12:10 PM Air Canada must honor refund policy invented by airline’s chatbot | Ars Technica https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/ 1/5The chatbot provided inaccurate information, encouraging Moffatt to book a ﬂight immediately andthen request a refund within 90 days. In reality, Air Canada's policy explicitly stated that the airline willnot provide refunds for bereavement travel after the ﬂight is booked. Moffatt dutifully attempted tofollow the chatbot's advice and request a refund but was shocked that the request was rejected.Moffatt tried for months to convince Air Canada that a refund was owed, sharing a screenshot fromthe chatbot that clearly claimed:Air Canada argued that because the chatbot response elsewhere linked to a page with the actualbereavement travel policy, Moffatt should have known bereavement rates could not be requestedretroactively. Instead of a refund, the best Air Canada would do was to promise to update the chatbotand offer Moffatt a $200 coupon to use on a future ﬂight.Unhappy with this resolution, Moffatt refused the coupon and ﬁled a small claims complaint inCanada's Civil Resolution Tribunal.According to Air Canada, Moffatt never should have trusted the chatbot and the airline should not beliable for the chatbot's misleading information because Air Canada essentially argued that \"thechatbot is a separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions,\" a court order said.Experts told the Vancouver Sun that Moffatt's case appeared to be the ﬁrst time a Canadian companytried to argue that it wasn't liable for information provided by its chatbot.Tribunal member Christopher Rivers, who decided the case in favor of Moffatt, called Air Canada'sdefense \"remarkable.\"\"Air Canada argues it cannot be held liable for information provided by one of its agents, servants, orrepresentatives—including a chatbot,\" Rivers wrote. \"It does not explain why it believes that is thecase\" or \"why the webpage titled 'Bereavement travel' was inherently more trustworthy than itschatbot.\"Further, Rivers found that Moffatt had \"no reason\" to believe that one part of Air Canada's websitewould be accurate and another would not.Air Canada \"does not explain why customers should have to double-check information found in onepart of its website on another part of its website,\" Rivers wrote.In the end, Rivers ruled that Moffatt was entitled to a partial refund of $650.88 in Canadian dollars(CAD) off the original fare (about $482 USD), which was $1,640.36 CAD (about $1,216 USD), as well asadditional damages to cover interest on the airfare and Moffatt's tribunal fees.If you need to travel immediately or have already travelled and would like to submit yourticket for a reduced bereavement rate, kindly do so within 90 days of the date your ticket wasissued by completing our Ticket Refund Application form. 5/1/24, 12:10 PM Air Canada must honor refund policy invented by airline’s chatbot | Ars Technica https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/ 2/5Air Canada told Ars it will comply with the ruling and considers the matter closed.Air Canada’s chatbot appears to be disabledWhen Ars visited Air Canada's website on Friday, there appeared to be no chatbot support available,suggesting that Air Canada has disabled the chatbot.Air Canada did not respond to Ars' request to conﬁrm whether the chatbot is still part of the airline'sonline support offerings.Last March, Air Canada's chief information oﬃcer Mel Crocker told the Globe and Mail that the airlinehad launched the chatbot as an AI \"experiment.\"Initially, the chatbot was used to lighten the load on Air Canada's call center when ﬂights experiencedunexpected delays or cancellations.“So in the case of a snowstorm, if you have not been issued your new boarding pass yet and you justwant to conﬁrm if you have a seat available on another ﬂight, that’s the sort of thing we can easilyhandle with AI,” Crocker told the Globe and Mail.Over time, Crocker said, Air Canada hoped the chatbot would \"gain the ability to resolve even morecomplex customer service issues,\" with the airline's ultimate goal to automate every service that didnot require a \"human touch.\"If Air Canada can use \"technology to solve something that can be automated, we will do that,”Crocker said.Air Canada was seemingly so invested in experimenting with AI that Crocker told the Globe and Mailthat \"Air Canada’s initial investment in customer service AI technology was much higher than the costof continuing to pay workers to handle simple queries.\" It was worth it, Crocker said, because \"theairline believes investing in automation and machine learning technology will lower its expenses\" and\"fundamentally\" create \"a better customer experience.\"It's now clear that for at least one person, the chatbot created a more frustrating customerexperience.Experts told the Vancouver Sun that Air Canada may have succeeded in avoiding liability in Moffatt'scase if its chatbot had warned customers that the information that the chatbot provided may not beaccurate.Because Air Canada seemingly failed to take that step, Rivers ruled that \"Air Canada did not takereasonable care to ensure its chatbot was accurate.\"\"It should be obvious to Air Canada that it is responsible for all the information on its website,\" Riverswrote. \"It makes no difference whether the information comes from a static page or a chatbot.\" 5/1/24, 12:10 PM Air Canada must honor refund policy invented by airline’s chatbot | Ars Technica https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/ 3/5READER COMMENTS262ASHLEY BELANGERAshley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated to tracking social impacts of emergingpolicies and new technologies.
