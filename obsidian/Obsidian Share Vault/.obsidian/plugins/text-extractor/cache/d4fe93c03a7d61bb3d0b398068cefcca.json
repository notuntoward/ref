Kalla † David E. Broockman ‡ September 25, 2017 Forthcoming, American Political Science Review Abstract Signiﬁcant theories of democratic accountability hinge on how political campaigns affect Americans’ candidate choices. We argue that the best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans’ candidates choices in general elections is zero. First, a systematic meta-analysis of 40 ﬁeld experiments estimates an average effect of zero in gen- eral elections. Second, we present nine original ﬁeld experiments that increase the statistical evidence in the literature about the persuasive effects of personal contact 10-fold. These exper- iments’ average effect is also zero. In both existing and our original experiments, persuasive effects only appear to emerge in two rare circumstances. First, when candidates take unusu- ally unpopular positions and campaigns invest unusually heavily in identifying persuadable voters. Second, when campaigns contact voters long before election day and measure effects immediately—although this early persuasion decays. These ﬁndings contribute to ongoing debates about how political elites inﬂuence citizens’ judgments. *We acknowledge seminar participants at the Midwest Political Science Association conference, the Northeast Political Methodology Meeting at NYU, Berkeley, Stanford, and the University of British Columbia as well as Adam Berinsky, Donald Green, Avi Feller, Shanto Iyengar, Jon Krosnick, Gabriel Lenz, Joel Middleton, Daron Shaw, Jas Sekhon, Eric Schickler, Laura Stoker, and Lynn Vavreck for helpful feedback.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Political elites can easily manipulate Americans’ political choices: this is the conclusion of a great deal of academic research and popular commentary (see Druckman 2004a; Issenberg 2012; Jacobson 2015; Lenz 2012). By its telling, Americans’ political judgments are susceptible to fram- ing, priming, and other forms of inﬂuence political elites wield when they advertise to and contact voters. Understanding the effects of elite communication on Americans’ choices has important implications for theories of public opinion, polarization, democratic competence, and campaign ﬁnance. For example, in the case of framing effects, as Druckman (2001, p. 226) reviews many scholars conclude that “elites often use framing to manipulate citizens’ judgments.” Nowhere would the implications of Americans’ susceptibility to such “elite manipulation” of their judgments be more theoretically and substantively signiﬁcant than in their candidate choices in general elections. Americans voting in general elections determine the balance of power in Congress and state legislatures. They decide whether to grant incumbents an advantage. They decide whether to reward politicians who have focused on raising money for advertising instead of other activities. They pick which party controls the White House. And the legislators who cast deciding votes on major legislation are disproportionately accountable to general electorates. How susceptible are American voters’ choices in general elections to inﬂuence from political elites in the form of campaign contact and advertising? It is surprisingly unclear on the basis of existing evidence. Reviews reach opposite conclusions, with some arguing that “the prevailing scholarly consensus on campaigns is that they have minimal effects,” (Brady, Johnston and Sides 2006, p. 4) and others indicating that many scholars believe “campaigns fundamentally shape voters’ decisions” (Druckman 2004b, p. 577). 1 If one consensus has been reached, it is that there is a dearth of studies in existing literature that credibly identify causal effects (Brox and Shaw 2009; DellaVigna and Gentzkow 2010; Jacobson 2015). 1Likewise, Jacobson’s (2015) review argues that “the ‘minimal effects’ thesis...has not survived” (p. 32) and Iyengar and Simon (2000, p. 150) summarize the “conventional academic wisdom” as that “the consequences of campaigns are far from minimal.” However, much of the evidence these reviews cover comes from a time when affective polarization was lower and voters might have been more persuadable than they are today (Iyengar, Sood and Lelkes 2012). 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Speaking to enduring debates about the susceptibility of voters to elite persuasion, we analyze results from 49 ﬁeld experiments on the persuasive effects of campaign contact and advertising. All these experiments rigorously estimate the effects of real campaigns’ choices about which voters to persuade and how to persuade them in the context of real elections. We ﬁnd: • The best estimate for the persuasive effects of campaign contact and advertising—such as mail, phone calls, and canvassing—on Americans’ candidate choices in general elections is zero. Our best guess for online and television advertising is also zero, but there is less evidence on these modes. • When campaigns contact voters long before election day and measure effects immediately, campaigns often appear to persuade voters. However, this early persuasion decays before election day and the very same treatments usually cease working close to election day. This suggests political scientists and practitioners should consider whether an experiment was run close to an election when attempting to generalize its ﬁndings. • Campaigns can sometimes identify pockets of persuadable voters, but even this only appears possible in some elections and when campaigns conduct within-cycle ﬁeld experiments to identify responsive subgroups. • We ﬁnd campaigns are able to have meaningful persuasive effects in primary and ballot measure campaigns, when partisan cues are not present. • Our evidence is silent on several questions. It does not speak to the effects of candidates’ qualities, positions, or overall campaign “message.” It does not indicate the optimal alloca- tion of campaign spending across voter registration, get-out-the-vote, and persuasion efforts. It also remains possible campaigns could develop more effective persuasive messages. Fu- ture experimental research should consider these questions. 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 We contextualize these ﬁndings in a theoretical argument that draws on theories of partisanship and political communication to argue that when a partisan cue and competing frames are present, campaign contact and advertising are unlikely to inﬂuence voters’ choices. We present two forms of evidence that support this argument. First, we present the ﬁrst meta-analysis of the emerging ﬁeld experimental and quasi-experimental 2 literature on campaign contact and advertising. Such evidence was once rare and the many studies that have now been done are often imprecise on their own. However, enough such evidence has been reported in recent years to conduct a relatively precise meta-analysis. This meta-analysis estimates that campaign contact and advertising can have persuasive effects in primaries and in ballot measure elections. However, their effects on election day in general elections are essentially zero. These results are robust across elections at every level of government and in both competitive and uncompetitive elections (terms we deﬁne below). Our meta-analysis surfaced a surprising dearth of statistically precise studies that examine the effects of personal contact from campaigns, such as phone calls and face-to-face conversations, which could be expected to have the largest persuasive effects.3 Therefore, our second empirical contribution is a series of original studies we conducted in partnership with a national door-to-door canvassing operation in 2015 and 2016. These studies all focused on measuring the effects of in-person, door-to-door persuasive canvassing in general elections, a common strategy (Enos and Hersh 2015). Exploiting recent advances in experimental design (Broockman, Kalla and Sekhon 2017), these studies are unusually precise: together, our original studies increase the amount of statistical evidence in the literature about the persuasive effects of personal contact in general elections by over 10-fold. Nearly all these studies also found a zero effect on which candidates voters supported on election day. Does campaign contact ever persuade voters in general elections? Both our meta-analysis and 2Our criteria for research is described in further detail below. 3For example, they appear to have the largest effects on turnout (Enos and Fowler 2016; Gerber and Green 2000; Green and Gerber 2015). 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 our original studies suggest two caveats to our otherwise consistent ﬁnding of null effects. First, we ﬁnd an intriguing pattern whereby campaign contact in general elections appears to have persuasive effects if it takes place many months before an election, but that these effects decay before election day. However, when these same tactics are deployed closer to election day, they do not even have immediate effects. We show this pattern both in aggregate and in the context of four studies where there is variation in the timing of both campaign contact and outcome measurement. In all these cases, we only see effects of campaign contact in general elections when voters receive contact far before election day and outcomes are measured immediately. But these effects are typically illusory: as election day approaches, the effects of early campaign contact and advertising decay and the immediate effects of subsequent contact and advertising almost always go to zero. Can campaign contact in general elections ever have persuasive effects that matter on election day? In the existing literature and in our original studies, we also ﬁnd that campaigns appear able to have persuasive effects in circumstances in which candidates take unusually unpopular posi- tions and opposing campaigns invest unusually heavily in identifying persuadable, cross-pressured voters whom they can inform about these positions (Hersh and Schaffner 2013; Rogers and Nick- erson 2013). In these cases, identifying cross-pressured persuadable voters requires much more effort than simply applying much-ballyhooed “big data” (Endres 2016; Hersh 2015). For example, the organization we partnered with on our original studies conducted large-scale ﬁeld experiments early in the electoral cycle in several states to identify subgroups of persuadable voters that were difﬁcult to predict ex ante. They then shifted resources to focus on persuading these voters—a strategy that the data we present below suggests was successful. This strategy only appears able to ﬁnd subgroups of persuadable voters in some elections, however, and can only be executed by campaigns with considerable resources and sophistication. These ﬁndings are consistent with our theoretical argument that campaigns can provide new considerations or increase the salience of certain considerations before an election campaign is active, but that such effects nearly always diminish when competing frames and clear cues (such 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 as partisanship and candidate attributes) are available. Voters in general elections appear to bring their vote choice into line with their predispositions close to election day and are difﬁcult to budge from there (e.g., Gelman and King 1993). Supporting this interpretation, we also do not ﬁnd clear evidence of generalizable subgroup effects, nor that persuasive campaigns have heterogeneous effects by “driving partisans home” to support their party’s candidate, nor that persuasive contact activates a candidate’s supporters to turn out. 4 To be clear, our argument is not that campaigns, broadly speaking, do not matter. For exam- ple, candidates can determine the content of voters’ choices by changing their positions, strategi- cally revealing certain information, and affecting media narratives—dynamics which are outside the scope of our analysis but could be affected by advertising (Holbrook 1996; Jacobson 2015; Johnston, Hagen and Jamieson 2004; Sides and Vavreck 2013). Campaigns can also effectively stimulate voter turnout (e.g., Gerber and Green 2000; Green, McGrath and Aronow 2013). Our argument is not that campaigns do not inﬂuence general elections in any way, but that the direct persuasive effects of their voter contact and advertising in general elections are essentially zero. In concluding, we discuss the broader implications of our ﬁndings for theories of political com- munication and democratic accountability. Our results harken back to an oft-criticized literature on the “minimal effects” of campaign interventions (e.g., Berelson, Lazarsfeld and McPhee 1954; Klapper 1960; Lazarsfeld, Berelson and Gaudet 1948). A common critique of the original litera- ture on “minimal effects” was that campaigns may not appear to have aggregate effects because any advertising they engage in is immediately reciprocated with responses from their opponents that “cancel out” in aggregate. Importantly, because the studies we analyze and present are indi- vidually randomized, they are not susceptible to this critique: it is not possible for an opposing campaign to reciprocate advertising to the treatment group but not the control group in these ex- periments, unless it somehow had knowledge of the treatment and control group assignments. 5 As 4Other research has found evidence for these phenomena in some cases, but this does not appear to be a reliable feature in our experiments. 5That ﬁeld experiments identify partial and not general equilibrium effects is often considered a key weakness 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 a result, our ﬁndings suggest that a relatively strong version of the minimal effects thesis may hold in general elections—not because campaign effects cancel each other out, but because they have no average effects at all. This ﬁnding may help explain why campaigns increasingly focus on rous- ing the enthusiasm of existing supporters instead of reaching across party lines to win over new supporters (Panagopoulos 2016). Our ﬁndings also offer an important caveat to the widespread notion that political elites can easily manipulate citizens’ political choices. The circumstances in which citizens’ political choices appear manipulable appear to be exceedingly rare in the elections that matter most. Theoretical Perspectives Political behavior research generally depicts Americans’ political predispositions as highly durable and resistant to change (Campbell et al. 1960; Green, Palmquist and Schickler 2002; Sears and Funk 1999). Consistent with these ﬁndings, Page and Shapiro (1992) ﬁnd “a remarkable degree of stability” in aggregate public opinion (p. 45; see also Druckman and Leeper (2012a)). Research suggests two broad reasons why campaign advertising and contact might have effects on voters’ candidate choices nevertheless: providing voters new considerations and heightening the salience of existing considerations. 6 We argue that close to election day in a general election, it is difﬁcult for campaigns to persuade voters with either mechanism. First, when it comes to providing voters with new arguments, frames, and information, by the time election day arrives, voters are likely to have already absorbed all the arguments and information they care to retain from the media and other sources beyond the political campaigns (Deaton 2010), but in this case it represents a strength: we are explicitly interested in identifying the partial equilibrium effects of campaign contact, as it can help us understand the nature of the general equilibria that may exist. 6This conception is speciﬁc to memory-based models, but an analogous version of the argument that follows can be made for models of on-line processing: Voters already aware of a candidates’ attributes or positions are not likely to update their affective “running tally” toward the candidate when being informed of such attributes yet again; and the strength of affect towards partisan groups should typically overwhelm any candidate-speciﬁc affect (Iyengar, Sood and Lelkes 2012). 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 themselves (Gelman and King 1993). This is not to say that voters will know all the relevant information campaigns could provide them, but that they are likely to have been exposed to all this information and that, of this information, they will have chosen to retain nearly all they care to (Petty and Cacioppo 1986). It is clearly the case that voters do not know everything about most candidates; but if voters still have not retained any of the information they lack after weeks of being exposed to that information in the media, it is unlikely that campaigns will prove any more effective in getting that information through to them. We also expect that there is a shrinking amount of information that campaigns could give Amer- ican voters in general elections that would produce meaningful persuasion. There are shrinking numbers of “cross-pressured” voters for campaigns to push to their side through such crossover appeals (Hersh and Schaffner 2013; Smidt 2017). Correlations between voters’ partisan predis- positions and their racial and issue views have increased dramatically (Abramowitz 2010). This means that a dwindling number of voters have conﬂicting considerations that would lead them to abandon their party; by following partisan cues, most voters can make the same choices they would make had they decided using other attributes of the candidates. In such an environment, it may be difﬁcult for campaigns to change voters’ minds by informing them about a candidate’s positions, as voters are likely to agree with their party on any issues on which they have opinions in the ﬁrst place (Berinsky 2009; Lauderdale 2016; Freeder, Lenz and Turney 2017). 7 This means that although campaigns may have some scope for persuasion in competitive primary elections, where there is no partisan cue, in general elections there are few considerations they can provide today’s voters that would lead them to abandon their party; these considerations increasingly push voters to vote for their party anyway. 8 7In addition, there are very few true independents who do not have a partisan cue to rely on (Klar and Krupnikov 2016; Smidt 2017). 8The existence of split-ticket voters indicates there are clearly other candidate characteristics voters value, such as qualiﬁcations or ideology. Our argument similarly applies to information about these candidate attributes: if the media is already making these attributes clear to voters, it is unlikely that campaigns providing them again would change many voters’ minds. 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 A second main mechanism for the persuasive effects of campaign contact and advertising is thought to be that they temporarily make certain considerations more salient as people decide what they think (Zaller 1992). However, conditions that sharply limit the effects of salience-raising frames are likely to be met in general elections. The salience-raising effects of communication diminish in the presence of clear cues (Druckman, Peterson and Slothuus 2013) and when individ- uals are exposed to competing arguments and information (Druckman 2004a). For example, being exposed to both sides of political debates “limit[s] and often eliminate[s]” these effects because all the considerations people believe are relevant have been made salient, especially the partisan cue that makes other frames irrelevant to many voters (Druckman 2004a, p. 683; see also Chong and Druckman (2007); Druckman and Leeper (2012b); Sniderman and Theriault (2004)). Consistent with this view, Leeper and Slothuus (2015) ﬁnd that providing voters with new information about the substance of their choices can change their attitudes, but that once they have this information, providing them additional frames or emphasizing certain considerations does little to affect their choices. As a result, our empirical expectation is that contact from campaigns in general elections could have effects early in the electoral cycle before the media provides competing frames and relevant information, but that these effects would decay rapidly, consistent with campaigns being able to temporarily make certain considerations salient when competing messages are not yet present be- cause the campaign has not yet started (Hill et al. 2013). But we argue that it will be difﬁcult for campaigns to produce even these short-lived effects within a couple months of a general elec- tion, consistent with campaigns no longer persuading voters once the media environment naturally raises the salience of the considerations being provided by all sides. These arguments yield the theoretical predictions shown in Table 1. As the Table notes, our ar- gument does not pertain to effects candidates might have by actually changing their platforms and positions, by being of higher quality, by securing more favorable media coverage, and so on. How- ever, we argue that what campaign contact and advertising typically does—providing information 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 voters are already being exposed to and attempting to increase the salience of this information—is very unlikely to lead voters to cross partisan lines. For example, a typical Democratic candidate sending mailers to voters featuring some of her more popular positions the media has already told voters she has we expect to be unlikely to persuade many voters to vote differently. By contrast, it may well be the case that actually changing her positions on these issues would affect election outcomes; our argument does not pertain to that counterfactual. Table 1: Theoretical Predictions Context Party cue present? Close to election? Prediction: Persuasive effects of campaign contact/advertising likely? General elections Yes Yes No General elections Yes No Yes, but will decay before election Ballot measures No Yes Yes Ballot measures No No Yes, but may decay before election Primary elections No Yes Yes Primary elections No No Yes, but may decay before election Context Party cue present? Close to election? Prediction: Persuasive effects from candidate positions, media environment, etc.? All Either Either Outside of paper’s scope Existing work does not clearly test these predictions. It is obvious that the effects of elite attempts to persuade voters will be smaller in real-world, competitive environments than in the artiﬁcial survey environments in which scholars typically study them (e.g., Barabas and Jerit 2010). However, it is unclear whether such effects are merely smaller or if they indeed are so small they are essentially non-existent. We hypothesized that the dynamics we discussed—the shrinking numbers of cross-pressured voters and the presence of competing frames in environments with partisan cues—would mean that contact from political campaigns have minimal effects on American voters’ candidate choices in the run-up to a general election. This argument is by no means obvious. Campaigns spend a great deal of money advertising to voters and the ﬁrms and consultants who proﬁt from these activities argue that their effects are large. Consistent with this optimism, nearly every recent review of the literature on campaign 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 effects argues that the consensus among a previous generation of scholarship that campaigns have “minimal effects” on voters can be decidedly rejected in the wake of new research (Druckman 2004a; Iyengar and Simon 2000; Jacobson 2015). However, the vast majority of the evidence that has been marshaled in favor of this claim comes from observational studies, studies of primary elections, and studies of campaign interventions that collect outcomes far before election day. We draw on the new wealth of carefully identiﬁed studies of campaign contact to shed new light on this question and test our theory. Meta-Analysis of Field Experiments and Quasi-Experiments As a ﬁrst test of our theoretical predictions, we see whether they ﬁt patterns we observe in an original meta-analysis we conducted of the existing ﬁeld experimental and quasi-experimental literature on the effects of campaign contact and advertising in US elections. In the wake of the “credibility revolution” in social science research, scholars have produced a wealth of rigorous research that credibly estimates the effects of campaign activity. A recent meta-analysis considers the average effect of campaign activity on turnout (Green, McGrath and Aronow 2013), but we are aware of no similar meta-analysis on the effects of campaign activity on persuasion. 9 9Lau, Sigelman and Rovner (2007) conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of negative political campaigns. Their analysis largely focuses on laboratory studies and observational studies and is limited to negative political campaigns. As such, it may miss the effect of campaigns that are more positive or focus on the contrast with the other candidate, includes studies without identiﬁcation strategies, and includes studies of hypothetical campaigns, which may raise external validity concerns. Nevertheless, these authors, too, conclude that “the research literature does not bear out the proposition that negative political campaigns ‘work’ in shifting votes towards those who wage them” (p. 1183). 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Data Our meta-analysis began with an exhaustive process10 to collect all public studies using plausi- ble identiﬁcation strategies to estimate the effect of campaign advertising and outreach through the mail, phone calls, canvassing, TV, online ads, or literature drops on voters’ candidate choices and evaluations: primarily randomized trials but also regression discontinuity designs, natural ex- periments, and difference-in-differences designs. We list all the studies we included in Online Appendix B. We also excluded a few studies, as discussed in Online Appendix B.24. For exam- ple, Arceneaux and Nickerson (2010) did not include a control group and focused on differences between treatments only, so we could not include an estimate of the effect of the campaign they studied. For each study, we carefully collected information on the following from the original write-ups, or, if necessary, from the authors: • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. – Some studies code a vote for the opposing candidate as -1 and vote for the cooperating candidate as 1. In these cases, we recode the data as 0 for the opposing candidate and 1 for the cooperating candidate, so that the estimates always have the interpretation of “percentage point effect on vote share.” – In some cases, vote choice was not measured, but rather favorability or approval. In these cases we use whichever variable is closest to capturing vote choice. – Some studies emphasized subgroup effects that were not pre-registered in advance; in these cases, we used the average effect estimates, not the effects among subgroups that were chosen post hoc. Given that the studies all examine the persuasive effect of 10To ensure that we had the complete universe of public studies and unpublished working papers, we began with a list of studies identiﬁed in a recent methodological article (Broockman, Kalla and Sekhon 2017). We then e-mailed several listservs with our preliminary list of studies and contacted the authors of most of these studies to ask if our list was complete. 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 campaign contact among voters campaigns themselves decided to contact, the average treatment effect is arguably the estimand of greatest interest. – Where possible, we used complier average causal effect (treatment-on-treated) esti- mates. – When studies have multiple treatment arms that we are unable to combine into a pooled estimate given the information available in the articles or replication data, we enter each treatment arm’s estimates separately into our meta-analysis and cluster the standard errors at the study level, given the shared control group. • Days after election the survey was taken. This is coded as a negative number if the survey is taken before the election. 11 For studies that measure outcomes at the aggregate (e.g., precinct) level rather than with surveys, this is 0 by deﬁnition. • Days after treatment the survey was taken. The number of days between treatment delivery and outcome measurement. For studies that measure outcomes at the precinct level, this is the number of days before the election the treatment occurred. • Mode of treatment. Examples include door-to-door canvassing, phone banks, and mail. We also collected the following contextual information: • Election stage. Primary or general election. • Seat. US President, US House, mayor, and so on. • Incumbency. • Competitiveness. Our deﬁnition of competitiveness is whether a reasonable outside observer would expect the election outcome to be uncertain rather than a foregone conclusion. Rec- 11We always use election day and do not take early voting into account, as dates of early voting are not consistently available across studies. 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 ognizing this deﬁnition is somewhat subjective, we found that in most cases it was easy to categorize races as competitive or not. We provide details in Online Appendix B. 12 Results The results of our meta-analysis are shown in Figure 1. 13 Panel 1(a) shows the average effect of campaign outreach in general elections when the treat- ments are delivered within two months of election day. Consistent with our theoretical expec- tations, the average effect is zero.14 Indeed, only two studies have statistically signiﬁcant point estimates, about what would be expected given mild publication bias and this number of public studies. We discuss these studies in more detail below; the campaign strategies in both are unusual and not easily scaleable. 15 Figure 2 shows that t-statistics from these studies follow a normal dis- tribution nearly exactly. The right panel shows a Q-Q plot consistent with nearly all studies ﬁnding zero effects with a slight underrepresentation of effects very near zero, as would be expected given publication bias.16 Together, these studies suggest that the most optimistic estimate that could be warranted from the literature is that campaign contact persuades about 1 in 175 voters, but that our best guess is that it persuades about 1 in 800 voters, substantively zero. Panel 1(b) shows that in the subset of studies in which treatment is delivered long before elec- tion day and its effects are measured immediately, the effects are clearly positive on average. 17 12For example, Nickerson (2005) studies the effects of a Michigan Democratic party organization’s outreach in targeted state legislative races; we assume the party organization selected races to target that were competitive. 13Our meta-analysis uses random effects with standard errors clustered at the study level. Results are robust to using ﬁxed effects or the permutation test described in Follman and Proschan (1999). Follman and Proschan (1999) demonstrate that random effects estimates in meta-analyses can inﬂate the type I error rate. Because we ﬁnd a null, we are not concerned with the increased likelihood of a false positive. If anything, the random effects estimate is conservative in the case of the null ﬁndings we report below. 14These results are not an artifact of survey measurement: in precinct randomized experiments that do not rely on self-reported survey data, we ﬁnd an average treatment effect of -0.02 percentage points. 15One study involved the candidate themselves knocking on doors. The other involved individually identifying persuadable voters with a pre-survey that most voters do not answer, limiting the reach of this strategy. 16Our outreach to authors of previous experiments and listservs yielded at least ﬁve additional experiments with null effects that have not been written up (Franco, Malhotra and Simonovits 2014). 17The one exception is the multiple treatments from Shaw, Blunt and Seaborn (2017). While noisy, the 95% conﬁ- dence intervals from these treatments all include positive values. Excluding Shaw, Blunt and Seaborn (2017) results 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 However, Panel 1(c) shows that in the two existing studies that examined whether these initial positive effects persisted, they were found to decay. This is consistent with our theoretical argu- ment that when scholars study persuasion far from election day, when competing messages are not present, it can appear that persuasion is possible, but that such effects evanesce rapidly and likely would not appear were the persuasion attempted close to election day. (We present more evidence consistent with this pattern later.) Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 3 show the meta-analyses for primary and ballot measure elections, respectively. We see clear signiﬁcant effects in both these election types. Nearly all of these elections were competitive, reinforcing our argument that competitive environments alone are not responsible for extinguishing campaign effects near general elections, but that partisan cues present only in general elections play a role in extinguishing persuasive effects. Our meta-analysis is consistent with our theory that persuasive effects can exist in primaries and far from election day in general elections, but decays rapidly and are nearly impossible close to election day. Original Field Studies in 2015 and 2016 Our meta-analysis of well-identiﬁed campaign research uncovered the relative imprecision of the existing studies of persuasive personal contact, such as door-to-door canvassing. The eight extant studies using personal contact and conducted with two months of election day have an average treatment effect of negative 1.9 percentage points with a pooled standard error of 1.7 percentage points. This uncertainty, coupled with the expectation from the voter turnout literature that in- person treatments tend to show larger effects (Enos and Fowler 2016; Gerber and Green 2000; Green and Gerber 2015), led us to collaborate with a nationwide door-to-door canvassing operation in an average effect of 3.16 percentage points with a 95% conﬁdence interval from 1.34 to 4.99 percentage points.

These studies improve on the statistical precision of the literature on the persuasive effect of personal contact close to election day more than tenfold. We conducted these studies to rule out several alternative explanations for the null effects found in our meta-analysis: • One reason voters in general elections are thought to be hard to persuade is because they do not “receive” political messages in the ﬁrst place, being disinterested in political topics and not avid consumers of media bearing political news (Zaller 1992). But, as we discuss below, in our studies of personal contact we can be conﬁdent a voter received a message because a campaign worker physically spoke with them about it face-to-face. • We can show that our conclusions about null effects are not driven by low-quality campaign activity. First, we ﬁnd that our partner organization had larger-than-typical effects in persua- sion experiments conducted during a 2015 primary and a 2015 special election as well as 16 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Figure 3: Meta-Analysis Forest Plots: Primary and Ballot Measure Elections (a) Primary elections RE Model −20 −10 0 10 20 Estimated Treatment Effect (CACE) in Percentage Points and 95% Confidence Interval Subset: Primary Elections − All Shaw et al.

In addition, contact from them early on in the electoral cycle had effects, consistent with our theory. • Another possible alternative explanation for null effects is a simple “saturation” explanation; that is, an explanation whereby a marginal campaign contact has no effect because voters have already received so many contacts from other campaigns but that the average effect of these contacts is nonzero. For example, perhaps a marginal piece of persuasive mail is unlikely to have much effect if voters have already received 100 pieces of mail, even if the average effect of receiving mail is nonzero. In addition to our evidence that persuasion is possible in highly competitive primary and ballot measure elections, our focus on door-to- door canvassing also helps rule out this alternative. We show in Figure OA4 that the vast majority of voters in these competitive elections received no other door-to-door persuasive contact. We return to this question in the discussion. • Research on voter turnout and other activities suggests that face-to-face conversations are the likeliest to have large effects on voters (e.g., Enos and Fowler 2016; Gerber and Green 2000; Green and Gerber 2015), meaning the door-to-door canvassing conversations we studied were, if anything, likely to overestimate the effects of other campaign activity. • These studies estimate the effects of activities that represent the strategic choices of a real campaign about who to target and what to say, rather than the (potentially less generalizable) decisions of academics attempting to mimic what real campaigns do. Design We conducted three randomized experiments with this partner organization before the ﬁnal two months of the 2016 election. In the ﬁnal two months of that election, we conducted four additional randomized experiments and two difference-in-difference studies with them. Below, we discuss the common elements across the designs of these studies. In Online Appendix D, we discuss 18 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 each experiment in detail, including the experimental universe, tests of covariate balance, tests of differential attrition, treatment scripts, the outcome measures, and the results. These experiments were paid for and administered by the partner organization; no university funds were used, and the authors advised the organization on implementation in their personal capacity as unpaid consultants. Persuasive Interventions The scripts canvassers used across these studies generally followed the same approach, which this partner organization has developed across several election cycles. These scripts are similar to the scripts reported in the other canvassing experiments we found for the meta-analysis. • Introduction: “Hi, my name is [X] with [PARTNER ORGANIZATION]. We’re out today talking with folks in the neighborhood about the future of [STATE]. Are you [NAME]? Great!” • Identify important issue: “First a quick survey. When you think about the upcoming election on November 8th, what is the most urgent issue to you and your family?” • Identify current candidate preference: “In the upcoming election for [RACE], Republican [NAME] is running against Democrat [NAME]. If you were going to vote today, would you vote for [REP] or [DEM]?” • Establish source credibility: “[PARTNER ORGANIZATION] is an independent organiza- tion that represents over [STATE NUMBER OF PEOPLE] who want an economy that works for working people. We are not part of any political party or campaign and support candi- dates based on their record.” • Persuasion on important issue: “You said earlier that [ISSUE] was the most important issue to you. I understand. How you vote is a personal decision. [PARTNER ORGANIZATION] 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 has done the research on the economic issues and the records of the candidates. [Explain relevant issue background and candidate record. This would typically include an explana- tion of candidates’ issue positions as well as valence qualities relevant to the issue, such as experience, competency, and integrity.]” For all of our studies, the same staff at the partner organization researched and wrote all of the scripts, ensuring that they always conveyed similar information. The scripts for each campaign are given in Online Appendix D. Field Experiment and Survey Designs The design of the ﬁeld experiments closely follows the four methodological practices for ﬁeld experiments with survey outcomes outlined in Broockman, Kalla and Sekhon (2017). In all the ﬁeld experiments, the following steps were taken: 1. The partner organization identiﬁed voters it wanted to persuade and had their independent public opinion research division enroll them in online surveys by mail. These surveys in- cluded dozens of questions on political, social, and cultural issues. This was designed to separate the survey measurement from the treatment and to limit demand effects. Note that this activity was administered and paid for completely by the partner organization; university resources were not used in any way. This paid survey design with a variety of both political and nonpolitical questions has been shown to produce samples that are fairly representa- tive, including in political knowledge and past levels of political participation (Broockman, Kalla and Sekhon 2017). Online Appendix D shows representative assessments of those who completed each survey relative to the sampling frames from which they were recruited. 2. The partner organization canvassed enrolled voters with either a treatment or placebo mes- sage. Both scripts started identically to identify compliers symmetrically, and only branched 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 into different content after the voter at the door was identiﬁed. If multiple people in a house- hold responded to the survey, every survey respondent living in that household received the same treatment assignment. 3. The partner organization invited all voters who had been reached at the door (compliers) in either the treatment or placebo condition to complete follow-up surveys. Voters received gift cards to encourage high response rates. 4. We analyzed data collected by the partner organization to measure the effect of their canvass- ing on vote choice and candidate evaluations. The surveys typically included a vote choice question, a favorability question for each candidate, and (sometimes) a “best qualiﬁed” ques- tion. We always constructed our outcome measure the same way: We take the ﬁrst factor from the factor analysis of all of that race’s survey questions. Then we standardize to mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in the placebo group, with higher numbers representing greater support for the candidate endorsed by the partner organization. When incorporating these estimates into our meta-analysis, we divide all estimates and standard errors by 2 to approxi- mate a percentage point effect while maintaining the beneﬁt of multiple outcome measures. 18 Online Appendix D gives all the question wordings. We then regressed the outcome mea- sure on a binary indicator for treatment versus placebo and a series of pre-treatment and demographic covariates. We used cluster-robust standard errors at the household level. In Online Appendix D we describe the design and identiﬁcation strategy for our quasi-experimental difference-in-differences studies. The difference-in-difference studies included ﬁve waves of sur- veys conducted over the ﬁnal weeks of the campaign, with the ﬁnal wave on election day. Im- portantly, in these studies, we observe which voters the partner group actually contacted and have measures of voters’ opinions both before and after any contact. 18In a perfectly competitive election with voters split 50-50, the standard deviation of support for a candidate is 0.5. A one-percentage-point shift would thus correspond to a 0.02 standard deviation increase. 21 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Quality of Partner Organization: Evidence from Other Experiments One potential concern with these 2016 experiments is that they were all conducted with the same partner organization. This raises the question of whether any null effects reﬂect that organization’s own low quality, rather than the voters’ unpersuadability. After all, not every campaign operation is of equal quality (Nickerson 2007b). Fortunately, three experiments help establish that this partner organization is of unusually high quality. 19 The ﬁrst experiment was conducted during the 2015 mayoral Democratic primary in Philadel- phia. This was a competitive primary for an open seat. We found that the partner organization’s canvass six weeks before election day and measured a week later increased support for their en- dorsed candidate by approximately 11 percentage points (p = 0.01), which is nearly three times the average effect in our meta-analysis of other primary elections. In a follow-up survey conducted during the last week of the campaign, we continue to estimate effects of nine percentage points (p = 0.19). The second experiment was conducted during a 2015 special election for state legislator in Washington. This was a competitive election in which nearly $2 million was spent in total by the candidates and outside groups. The partner organization’s canvass had a substantively large six-percentage-point effect on support for their endorsed candidate (p = 0.01), although in a post- election survey, consistent with our theory, the effect had decayed. Our third experiment was a voter turnout experiment conducted during the 2016 general elec- tion in the battleground state of North Carolina. We found that the partner organization’s canvass increased turnout by nearly two percentage points (p = 0.04), which is 43% more effective than would be expected based on Green and Gerber’s (2015) meta-analysis of door-to-door voter turnout experiments. More details on all of these experiments are available in Online Appendix D. 19We conducted a fourth voter turnout experiment in Missouri during the 2016 general election. This experiment followed the same design as the North Carolina voter turnout experiment reported below, but due to an implementation error there was covariate imbalance between the compliers in the treatment and placebo groups. Full results from this experiment are reported in Online Appendix D. 22 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Overall, these experiments suggest that the partner organization is capable of persuading and mobilizing voters to the extent this is possible, typically with effects greater than average based on the literature. Results Table 2 shows the results of the original canvassing persuasion studies, with all effects shown in terms of standard deviations (d) on the ﬁrst factor of the candidate items in each survey. The subtables split the studies into categories. The ﬁrst subtable shows the 2015 experiments we just described, conducted during the 2015 Philadelphia Democratic mayoral primary and a Washington state legislative special election. The second subtable shows the ﬁrst experiment we conducted in the 2016 general election, over two months before election day. The third subtable shows experimental results when measurement was conducted within two months of election day. The fourth shows two difference-in-differences quasi-experiments. The ﬁnal subtable shows the results of a literature drop conducted at the end of the North Carolina canvasses.20 When “Experiment” is the same across multiple rows in each subtable, it means the estimates are drawn from the same study. For example, in the Ohio experiment that began in August, canvassers attempted to persuade voters with respect to both the senate and presidential races and there were both immediate and election day outcome measurements, so this one study appears four times in the table. Online Appendix D gives the dates of the surveys, the scripts used, the balance checks for each experiment, and other details of interest. Subtable (a) shows that the organization had effects in a 2015 primary and a 2015 special general election, as discussed, although in the case of the general election, their effects had decayed by election day, as predicted. Subtable (b) shows that the organization had effects in the 2016 20After completing the President and Senate persuasion scripts in North Carolina, canvassers would encourage voters to take literature on the gubernatorial and nonpartisan Supreme Court races. Beyond mentioning they were leaving this literature, canvassers did not engage in persuasion face-to-face on these races. For this reason, we do not include these in our later meta-analysis of personal contact. 23 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Ohio Senate race when measured immediately, although we ﬁnd in Subtable (c) that these effects decayed by election day. Subtable (c) reports our original ﬁeld experiments estimating that the canvassing from late August to mid-October had no effects on vote choice as measured within two months of election day, with a pooled estimate of -0.005 standard deviations (SE = 0.020). Subtable (d) shows the results of our quasi-experimental difference-in-differences designs in Ohio and North Carolina. In each case, the organization found subgroups of voters it estimated as more likely to be persuadable, based on the experiments in Subtable (c) and focused their canvassers on targeting these voters. The evidence in Subtable (d) suggests this was likely successful and that they ultimately had some persuasive effects targeting these voters. However, an important caveat to these conclusions is that the difference-in-differences designs entail stronger assumptions than the ﬁeld experiments from Subtable (c) does. We return to discussing the potential persuasion these quasi-experiments found in the next section. Subtable (e) reports the literature drop experiment and quasi-experiment. There, the only statistically signiﬁcant estimates are the nonpartisan Supreme Court race, which is consistent with our theory that effects are more likely in the absence of partisan cues. 21 Placing these ﬁndings in the context of the existing literature underscores their contribution and the consistent support they provide for our theory. Statistically, these experiments increase the amount of evidence in the literature about the effects of personal contact in general elections by about a factor of 10. 22 We also increase the amount of evidence in the literature about the effects of personal contact on candidate preferences within two months of a general election by a factor 21Inﬂuential theories argue that “the campaign brings the fundamentals of the election to the voters” (e.g., Wlezien and Erikson 2002, p. 987; see also Gelman and King (1993)). With this said, Figures OA1 and OA2 in the Online Appendix respectively ﬁnd no evidence of consistent heterogeneous effects of the treatments in our original studies by “driving partisans home” to their parties and no evidence of effects on turnout of pre-existing supporters. However, these are likely underpowered tests as they reﬂect the impact of a single contact. It may well be that the campaign has cumulative effects that do not appear in these individual contacts. We return to this question in the discussion. 22In particular, the precision of each study in the literature is 1 SE2 i and the total precision of multiple studies is ∑ 1 SE2 i , where SEi is the standard error of study i. Using this metric, the total precision of the prior literature in competitive elections is 0.255. Across our studies, it is 3.05. This is in terms of CACE (TOT) effects, but a similar ratio holds for ITT effects. 24 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Table 2: Results of Original Canvass Experiments in 2015 and 2016: Effects in Standard Deviations (d) (a) 2015 primary and special elections Experiment Measurement Race Canvass dates Estimate (Std. err.)

From this, we conclude that, on average, personal contact—such as door-to-door canvassing or phone calls—conducted within two months of a general election has no substantive effect on vote choice. The average effect from our meta-analysis is 0.58 percentage points, with a 95% conﬁdence interval ranging from -0.50 to 1.66 percentage points. The only statistically signiﬁcant estimates that come from within two months of a general election with party cues are in the difference-in-differences estimates, which measured the effects of programs that had been carefully targeted based on the results of the prior experiments. We now turn to discussing our interpretation of these estimates. When Persuasion in General Elections Appears Possible Across a large number of electoral settings, candidates, treatments, targets, organizations, and ex- perimental designs, our best guess is that persuasion attempts near election day in general elections fail to persuade voters. Despite the wide variation in experimental settings in the studies we exam- ined, we see treatment effect estimates of less than one percentage point more than half the time when measurement is conducted near election day. A formal test for heterogeneity across studies also ﬁnds none. These patterns suggest that null effects in general elections are the rule across most general elections; not only do we see zero persuasive effects on average, but we see the same in a wide variety of individual studies. Here we discuss two potential exceptions to this pattern of null effects. Although both are in line with our theoretical argument, we caution that this discussion is more tentative. It is quite pos- sible given the general pattern of null effects that the studies we discuss here are statistical ﬂukes. However, in the interest of transparency and critically examining our theoretical argument, we dis- 26 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Figure 4: Effects Within 2 Months of Election Day With Original Studies, By Contact Type (a) Personal contact RE Model −40 −20 0 20 40 Estimated Treatment Effect (CACE) in Percentage Points and 95% Confidence Interval Subset: Personal Contact − Treatment Within 2 Months of Election Day Original Study − MO Experiment − Governor − Canvass Original Study − OH DID − President − Canvass Original Study − OH DID − Senate − Canvass Original Study − NC DID − Governor − Warm Lit Drop Original Study − NC DID − President − Canvass Original Study − NC DID − Senate − Canvass Original Study − FL Experiment − Dem Candidates − Canvass Original Study − NC Experiment − Governor − Warm Lit Drop Original Study − NC Experiment − President − Canvass Original Study − NC Experiment − Senate − Canvass Original Study − OH Experiment Election Day − President − Canvass Original Study − OH Experiment Election Day − Senate − Canvass Cunow and Schwenzfeier (2015) Study 3 − Canvass Cunow and Schwenzfeier (2015) Study 2 − Canvass Cunow and Schwenzfeier (2015) Study 2 − Canvass Potter and Gray (2008) − Canvass Nickerson (2007) − Canvass Nickerson (2007) − Canvass Nickerson (2005) − Phone Nickerson (2005) − Phone Barton, Castillo and Petrie (2014) − Candidate Canvass Bailey, Hopkins and Rogers (2016) − Phone Bailey, Hopkins and Rogers (2016) − Canvass Arceneaux and Kolodny (2009) − Phone Arceneaux and Kolodny (2009) − Canvass 1.31 [ −4.17, 6.79] 2.75 [ 0.30, 5.20] −0.83 [ −4.84, 3.19] 3.50 [ −0.42, 7.42] −1.00 [ −3.94, 1.94] 2.50 [ −3.38, 8.38] −2.49 [ −8.21, 3.23] 3.70 [ −0.77, 8.17] −1.28 [ −5.14, 2.57] 2.22 [ −3.92, 8.36] −0.03 [ −3.98, 3.92] −0.14 [ −5.93, 5.65] 4.40 [ −5.20, 14.00] 1.10 [ −5.96, 8.16] −1.40 [ −9.63, 6.83] 24.00 [−64.20, 112.20] −5.30 [−14.12, 3.52] −5.50 [−13.54, 2.54] −4.20 [−14.59, 6.19] −1.60 [−11.60, 8.40] 20.70 [ 0.32, 41.08] 7.50 [ −7.00, 22.00] −9.40 [−19.79, 0.99] −22.00 [−51.40, 7.40] −30.00 [−60.38, 0.38] 0.58 [ −0.50, 1.66] (b) Impersonal contact RE Model −40 −20 0 20 40 Estimated Treatment Effect (CACE) in Percentage Points and 95% Confidence Interval Subset: Impersonal Contact − Treatment Within 2 Months of Election Day Sadin (2016) − Mail Rogers and Nickerson (2013) − Mail Potter and Gray (2008) − Mail Kalla and Sekhon (2017) − TV Gerber et al.

In both cases, we believe these potential exceptions are consistent with our theory, proving the rule that campaign contact seldom has meaningful effects on general election outcomes. In General Elections, Early Persuasion Rapidly Decays and Late Persuasion Rarely Appears As we have shown, most ﬁeld experiments on voter persuasion ﬁnd null effects; but many survey experiments report signiﬁcant effects. One potential reason for this discrepancy is the time at which each kind of study is typically done: most ﬁeld experiments measure effects close to election day, whereas survey experiments tend to be conducted outside active electoral contexts or far from election day and measure effects immediately. 23 Our theory expects immediate persuasive effects will be commonplace outside an active electoral context, but for effects to be more difﬁcult to achieve inside an active electoral context. Here we show that this potential explanation is supported by over-time variation in the effect sizes in ﬁeld experiments. 24 In the ﬁeld experimental literature, relatively few studies have been conducted more than two months before election day, but we need to observe the effects of this early persuasion to test our theory. Even fewer studies track whether early persuasion persists over time. Fewer studies still examine whether a treatment that had effects early in the cycle would have effects when deployed again closer to the election. However, we were able to locate two studies that test our predictions in the literature. Two of our own studies also do so. Table 3 shows evidence from these four studies, with Subtable 3a restating our theoretical predictions. 23Another difference between our studies and most survey experiments is that we focus on candidate choice, which is typically the choice voters are faced with, whereas survey experiments tend to focus on issue opinions, which appear to function differently than candidate choices (Berinsky 2017; Lenz 2012). 24Unfortunately these four studies were all conducted in general elections, so we are unable to test our prediction that effects would be larger but still decay somewhat if treatment were conducted early on in a primary or ballot measure campaign. All the experiments on primaries and ballot measures were conducted close to election day. 28 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Subtable 3b is a reanalysis we conducted of the data for Doherty and Adler (2014), a rare study in the literature that introduced variation in the timing of campaign contact. Consistent with our predictions, the campaign mailers they studied had persuasive effects in state legislative general elections when they were mailed months before the election and their effects were measured im- mediately (ﬁrst column). However, a subsequent survey of the same individuals closer to election day found that these persuasive effects had decayed (second column). Finally, a follow-up exper- iment found that the same mailers sent close to election day did not even have immediate effects (third column). Subtable 3c shows Gerber et al.’s (2011) ﬁeld experiment with the Rick Perry campaign on its TV advertising. This experiment was conducted many months before the general election and found immediate effects. However, these effects decayed within a week. Moreover, additional data provided by the authors ﬁnds that this same advertising did not have effects closer to election day. 25 Subtable 3d is a study we conducted with our research partner in the 2016 Ohio Senate elec- tion. The ﬁrst column shows that we found strong evidence in late August that their door-to-door canvassing program increased support for the Democratic candidate in the Ohio Senate election. However, the second column shows that when we re-surveyed the same voters that had been per- suaded in August closer to election day, this persuasion appears to have decayed. Moreover, as the third column shows, our subsequent measurement in the difference-in-differences analysis of the effects of the very same canvassing program conducted closer to election day found that it no longer had persuasive effects (the coefﬁcients in the ﬁrst and last column can be statistically distinguished). Finally, Subtable 3e shows results from one of the other studies we conducted with our research partner. This study of door-to-door canvassing conducted in a 2015 special state legislative general 25We thank Donald Green for providing these additional results.

A second measurement closer to election day found those effects decayed. Unfortunately, in this study we were not able to measure whether this canvassing would have had immediate effects closer to election day. A majority of the ﬁeld experiments in the literature that ﬁnd persuasive effects in general elec- tions are shown in Table 3. It appears we can account for all these effects by noting that they 30 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 occurred early in the election cycle; in every case where data is available, these treatments did not have effects that lasted until election day, nor did they have immediate effects when repeated close to election day. This grants additional support to our theory and raises questions about the generalizability of treatment effects measured outside of active election campaigns. Potential Exceptions Close to Election Day: Identifying Rare Cross-pressure and Exploiting Unusual Candidates There are three studies we are aware of in which an experiment or quasi-experiment found a statis- tically signiﬁcant persuasive effect measured within two months of an election. With the renewed caveat that these estimates could be statistical ﬂukes, we interpret the unusual features of all three of these studies as evidence consistent with our theory. Our theory expected that very few voters would typically be persuadable and that identifying them would be extremely difﬁcult. In all these three cases, the campaigns invested unusually heavily in identifying persuadable voters (Hillygus and Shields 2008) and were working to defeat an unusual candidate—circumstances our theory expected to be rare but, in the context of which, meaningful persuasive effects may be possible. First, Rogers and Nickerson (2013) worked with a pro-choice organization ahead of the 2008 US Senate election in Oregon to identify voters who identiﬁed as pro-choice in a pre-survey, many of whom did not realize that the Republican incumbent Senator was not consistently pro-choice. For the experiment, the group sent a mailer to only those voters who had identiﬁed as pro-choice in a pre-survey; the mailers attempted to correct these mistaken beliefs about the incumbent’s position on abortion. In follow-up surveys, Rogers and Nickerson (2013) ﬁnd that these mailers corrected these individuals’ beliefs and changed their vote in the Senate race. It is worth considering the multiple rare conditions this study met. An incumbent was demonstrably out of step on an issue— a Senator from Oregon who opposed abortion. Moreover, abortion is widely regarded as “easy” and important for many voters. Finally, the interest group had funded a pre-survey to identify 31 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 supporters of its issue, purging individuals from the target universe for the mailers who were anti- abortion and who might have had a negative reaction to the mailers—a strategy that cannot be widely applied because most voters do not answer surveys and cannot be identiﬁed for individual targeting of this type without individual voter survey responses (Endres 2016; Hersh 2015). We would expect persuasion to be possible in such conditions, but we expect such conditions to be extremely rare. Second, in the experiment our cooperating group conducted in North Carolina the door-to- door canvassers discussed the presidential and Senate candidates aloud with voters but left ﬂyers at the door with endorsements of the Democratic North Carolina gubernatorial candidate. These ﬂyers discussed how the Republican incumbent had cost the state billions of dollars as a result of supporting the unpopular HB 2 law that banned transgender people from using the bathrooms for the gender they identiﬁed with. The experiment found that black voters appeared to react positively to this material but white voters appeared to react negatively. In response to the experimental results, the group removed many white voters from their target lists going forward. We found in our follow-up measurement closer to election day that the overall program still had positive effects on vote for the Democratic gubernatorial candidate among blacks and negative effects on whites, and that the group’s targeting had changed enough that the overall average effect was more likely to be positive. It was not obvious to the partner organization that black voters would have positive effects and white voters negative effects; only by conducting an experiment was the group able to identify a responsive audience. Several aspects of this situation are quite unique. This same strategy would not have been possible in states where campaigns do not have access to voter race on voter rolls (Endres 2016; Hersh 2015). In addition, only by conducting an expensive randomized experiment far in advance was the group able to identify the right audience for its message—and only by conducting door-to-door canvassing was it able to limit its message to only this audience (whereas with TV ads, this individual-level targeting would not have been possible). Finally, the persuasive material was able to exploit a unique situation in which the governor had supported a 32 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 deeply unpopular piece of legislation on an easy issue that was salient to voters. 26 Third, our partner group found statistically signiﬁcant effects in the difference-in-differences analysis of their canvassing on the presidential race in Ohio. This was a highly unusual race because (a) a Republican candidate (Donald Trump) taking many positions out of step with the party, and (b) the prevailing campaign messages from the Democratic candidate’s (Hillary Clinton) campaign did not focus on the economic messages one might expect to persuade Ohio voters, although the partner group canvassers emphasized these issues.27 In addition, although the ﬁrst experiment did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects, the partner organization, as it did in North Carolina, adjusted its targeting to focus on the voters it estimated to be most persuadable, a subset it was unable to predict in advance without conducting the experiment at signiﬁcant expense. In summary, although these three studies suggest that persuasion close to election day is pos- sible sometimes, the broader context of these experiments and the substantively small effects they estimated underscore our broader pessimism that meaningful persuasion is possible for most cam- paigns close to most general elections. 28 These studies were all conducted in unusual electoral circumstances and among a subset of voters that most campaigns do not have the resources to identify, using data that most campaigns cannot even collect (Endres 2016; Hersh 2015). 29 26In addition, one caveat to this experiment is that since the persuasive ﬂyer was left with voters and they often answered the surveys in their homes, it is possible that they answered the survey with the persuasive ﬂyer in view but that in the ballot box they would not have remembered it. 27Fowler, Ridout and Franz (2016, see Figure 9) note that over 60% of Clinton’s TV ads were solely about candidate characteristics compared to those of Trump, over 70% of whose ads concerned policy, a ﬁgure much closer to what has typically been seen in presidential campaigns since 2000. 28We also investigated whether individuals who identify as independents might on average be more persuadable. As we show in Figure OA3, we ﬁnd no consistent persuasion effects among either pure independents or independents and party leaners, as measured during the pre-survey in our original studies. 29Another exception may be cases in which the candidate herself does the outreach and persuasion. In a general election, Barton, Castillo and Petrie (2014) ﬁnd that candidate persuasion has a nearly 21 percentage point effect on vote choice, but their standard errors are large. Recent research from the United Kingdom (Foos 2017) and Italy (Cantoni and Pons 2017) suggests more muted effects of candidate canvassing. Regardless, this strategy is unlikely to persuade meaningful numbers of voters in most elections, as a candidate can only knock on so many doors. 33 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Discussion Both assembling and contributing to the theoretical and empirical research literature to date, we present unique evidence indicating campaign persuasion is extremely rare in general elections; the best estimate of the size of persuasive effects in general elections in light of our evidence is zero. Although exceptions are possible, the evidence we carefully assembled from the literature and from a series of unique original studies paints a consistent picture. When party cues are absent in ballot measures and primaries or when persuasion is conducted far in advance of a general election, it appears that campaign contact and advertising can inﬂuence voters’ choices. But when we focus on the choices voters actually make on election day in a general election, we ﬁnd that any early persuasion has decayed and that any persuasion near election day fails reliably. This pattern of ﬁndings is surprising in light of recent reviews of the literature on campaign effects that posit that the classic “minimal effects” view of campaign contact and advertising can be decidedly rejected. Our evidence suggests that minimal effects of campaign contact and ad- vertising are the norm, with only rare exceptions. In this way, our ﬁndings are most consistent with a view stressing the “fundamentals” of an election in shaping the outcome rather than the role of campaigns; in other words, that “campaigns reinforce the political orientations of voters and mobilize them to vote rather than convert large segments of the population to new ways of think- ing” (Ansolabehere 2006, see also Gelman and King (1993); Sides and Vavreck (2013)). More generally, our ﬁndings cast doubt on the view that political elites can easily manipulate citizens’ judgments. With this said, we hasten to note several caveats to our argument. First, our argument is not that campaigns do not matter at all. Campaigns likely cannot directly change which candidates Americans support in general elections through the direct effects of contact and advertising. How- ever, candidates can still decide to change their issue positions, attract media coverage, and engage in other activities that may change who voters support. For example, other research argues that 34 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 the positions candidates take and the information they encourage the media to discuss, in part through their paid advertising, can inﬂuence elections (Sides and Vavreck 2013; Vavreck 2009). Our evidence does not speak to these forms of inﬂuence. 30 Campaigns clearly can also inﬂuence whether voters bother to vote at all. Indeed, another implication of our results is that campaigns may underinvest in voter turnout efforts relative to per- suasive communication. Although the marginal effects of get out the vote interventions are smaller in competitive general elections, especially in presidential years, they are still clearly positive (Green, McGrath and Aronow 2013). Indeed, we found that our partner canvassing organization had effects of nearly 2.5 percentage points on turnout in the 2016 Presidential election. If these canvassers had been working on persuading voters instead of mobilizing existing supporters, our best estimate is that they would have generated fewer net votes. In this way, our results speak to the puzzle of why campaigns have increasingly focused on rousing the enthusiasm of existing support- ers rather than reaching out to and attempting to persuade moderates (Panagopoulos 2016). 31 With this said, increasing turnout alone can only provide so many votes; if campaigns were able to have large persuasive effects, they would be able to change the outcome of many additional elections. 32 We also hasten to note several limitations to our evidence. First, the existing literature (and, by extension, our meta-analysis) provides only scarce evidence on the effects of television and digital advertising, which represent a great deal of campaign spending. 33 Although our theoretical argument would also apply to these forms of campaign communication and the little evidence we do have on them is consistent with null effects in general elections, more evidence about these mediums would clearly be welcome. In addition, our original evidence was largely from 2016. Al- 30One caveat to this view is that many apparent effects of campaign events may be due to differential nonresponse bias (Gelman et al. 2016). 31While most experiments in the literature have been conducted with Democratic or liberal-leaning organizations, the shift Panagopoulos (2016) identiﬁed appears in both parties. 32However, campaigns may be able to use persuasive efforts early on in an election cycle to identify supporters in a manner that assists later mobilization efforts (Carpenter 2016). 33Our evidence that the “warm literature drop” in the North Carolina Gubernatorial and Supreme Court elections appear to have effects also suggest further research on this medium is warranted. 35 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 though our meta-analysis drawing on experiments from other years is consistent with our ﬁndings, replicating these ﬁndings in future elections would clearly be of interest. Our new evidence also largely focused on general elections, although our meta-analysis and theory suggested that voter’s choices in primary elections—which are also politically signiﬁcant, of course—are much easier for campaigns to inﬂuence.34 Last, the ﬁeld experiments we reviewed and presented by and large measured the marginal effect of one contact rather than the total effect of an entire campaign’s persuasive activity. It may well be that many very small marginal effects that ﬁeld experiments do not have the statistical power to detect could add up to a large enough total effect to impact reasonable numbers of elections. This is a proposition that future research could test by randomly assigning entire campaign strategies, such as by having a party campaign committee randomly assign which legislative districts they target or what strategy they pursue in each district (e.g., Wantchekon 2003). Another caveat to our ﬁndings is that it remains possible that existing persuasive tactics could be improved. 35 Despite the stability of both micro- and macro-level predispositions and opinion on issues (Druckman and Leeper 2012a; Green, Palmquist and Schickler 2002; Page and Shapiro 1992; Sears and Funk 1999), there are clearly exceptions where public opinion has changed, such as the American public’s embrace of LGBT equality and in the evolution of party coalitions (Schickler 2016). These changes tend to be gradual, but suggest that sustained political advocacy and generational replacement can together ultimately produce the large opinion changes political practitioners may like to affect. Nevertheless, recent counterexamples of more rapid changes do exist in the context of theory-driven interventions, and future work should continue to evaluate their promise (e.g., Broockman and Kalla 2016; Paluck and Green 2009). 34One intriguing implication of this result for American politics research more generally is that interest groups may ﬁnd it more feasible to threaten ofﬁceholders through campaign spending in primaries than in general elections (e.g., Anzia 2011; Bawn et al. 2012). 35Nevertheless, our ﬁndings are decidedly not vulnerable to a common critique of ﬁeld experiments that the results of the interventions academics design and implement might not generalize to the effects of real campaigns. Since aca- demic institutions are not legally allowed to intervene in candidate elections, in every single study we have discussed, the voters to target were selected and treated by a real campaign. 36 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Consistent with this cautious optimism, the history of research on voter turnout is replete with examples of scholars identifying how psychological theories could be productively applied to have sizable effects from forms of contact that were once thought to produce relatively small effects (Gerber, Green and Larimer 2008; Nickerson 2007a; Nickerson and Rogers 2010)—theoretical innovations which rapidly diffused to campaigns (Issenberg 2012). It is conceivable that scholars and campaigns could work together to develop and test such advances in the realm of persuasion as well, advancing both campaign practice and scholarship. Indeed, recognizing that their existing approaches fall short might increase campaign practitioners’ interest in exploring new strategies. With this said, going forward, our consistent ﬁnding of null effects suggests that non-experimental studies of campaign communication or studies conducted outside of active campaign contexts that claim to ﬁnd large campaign effects in general elections should be viewed with healthy skepticism.

This table shows the relative infrequency of personal contact relative to other types of campaign activities. 51 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 B Candidate Campaign Meta-Analysis B.1 Arceneaux (2007) We cluster the standard errors for these studies since they were conducted on the same subjects. • Days after election the survey was taken. This is not speciﬁed, so we assume the survey took place 1 day after the election. • Days after treatment the survey was taken. Precise dates are not speciﬁed. Table 3 implies that the contact rate was 31% and the candidate was assigned to contact 3,227 people. This should take about 3-4 weeks if the candidate was canvassing full time (40-50 contacts per day), so we assume the treatment took place on average 2 weeks (14 days) before the election and the survey. • Mode of measurement. Post-election telephone survey. • Election stage. Primary. • Seat. County Commissioner. • Incumbency. Open seat. • Vote margin. The candidate, Deanna Archuleta-Loeser, won 48.5% of the vote while the other top contender won 36%. We therefore enter 48.5 - 36 = 12.5. • Competitiveness. Yes, as the paper notes, both candidates were running organized campaigns and were quality candidates with name recognition. B.1.1 Candidate Canvass • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Table 3 indicates 0.423 (0.19). • Mode of treatment. Candidate canvass. B.1.2 Volunteer Canvass • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Table 3 indicates 0.183 (0.13). • Mode of treatment. Canvass. B.1.3 Volunteer Phone Call • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Table 3 indicates 0.186 (0.08). • Mode of treatment. Phone call. 52 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 B.2 Arceneaux and Kolodny (2009) We cluster the standard errors for these two studies since they were conducted on the same subjects. • Days after election the survey was taken. In correspondence with the authors, they indicated the survey began two days after the election and ﬁnished interviewing within three weeks. We use 7. • Days after treatment the survey was taken. In correspondence with the authors, they indi- cated the canvassing and phone calls took place in the two weeks before the election, so we assume a week on average, for a total two weeks (14 days) on average between the treatment and survey. • Mode of measurement. Post-election telephone survey. We assume the survey was taken the day after the election. • Election stage. General. • Seat. State House. • Incumbency. The 156th was an open seat while in the 161st, the candidate was a challenger. • Vote margin. This experiment took place in two Pennsylvania State House Districts: 156 and 161. The 156th was decided by 28 votes for a vote margin of 0.12 points. The 161st was decided 51.5% to 48.5% for a vote margin of 3 points. Because these are both highly competitive races and we report the results pooled across each race, for the vote margin, we take the average and enter 1.6 ( 0.12+3 2 ). • Competitiveness. Yes; given the very close vote margin. The paper describes the Pennsylva- nia State House races as competitive and these were two swing districts. B.2.1 Canvassing • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Table 4 reports results for the ‘candidate preference’ outcome. Since the heterogenous treatment effects by the partisan identiﬁcation of the respondent were not pre-registered, we pool the results across the partisan groups. Pooling -0.102 (0.045), -0.047 (0.068), and 0.000 (0.058), we estimate an average ITT effect of -0.060 (0.031). In personal correspondence, the authors indicated the campaign indicated a canvass contact rate of approximately 9.98% but that this was an underestimate. To be conservative we assume a contact rate of 20%, which implies a CACE of -0.300 (0.155). • Mode of treatment. Canvass. 53 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 B.2.2 Phone • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Table 4 reports results for the ‘candidate preference’ outcome. Since the heterogenous treatment effects by the par- tisan identiﬁcation of the respondent were not pre-registered, we pool the results across the partisan groups. Pooling -0.072 (0.043), 0.025 (0.066), and -0.045 (0.054), we estimate an average ITT effect of -0.044 (0.030). In personal correspondence, the authors indicated a phone contact rate of approximately 12.75% but that this was underestimated. To be conser- vative, we assume a 20% contact rate. This implies a CACE of -0.22 (0.150). • Mode of treatment. Phone. B.3 Bailey, Hopkins and Rogers (2016) • Days after election the survey was taken. The election took place on November 4, 2008 and the surveys took place between October 21 and October 23 for an average of October 22. We therefore count the survey as having taken place 13 days before the election, entered as -13. • Days after treatment the survey was taken. The experiment began on October 9 and ended by October 21 for the surveying. Precise dates are not discussed, therefore we take the midpoint of the survey occurring 6 days after treatment ( 21−9 2 ). • Mode of measurement. Survey. • Election stage. General. • Seat. President. • Incumbency. Open. • Vote margin. In Wisconsin, Barack Obama won 56.2% to John McCain’s 42.3% for a vote margin of 13.9 points. • Competitiveness. Yes, the Washington Post considered Wisconsin to be a battleground state in 2008. 36 Both campaigns also spent considerable resources there, indicating they believed it would be competitive as well. B.3.1 Canvass • Mode of treatment. Canvass. • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. In Table 10, -0.0188 (0.0106) for the ITT. For the CACE, dividing by 0.2, this is -0.094 (0.053). 36http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/06/08/ GR2008060800566.html 54 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 B.3.2 Phone Call • Mode of treatment. Phone call. • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. In Table 10, -0.0105 (0.0103) for the ITT. For the CACE, dividing by 0.14, this is 0.075 (0.074). B.3.3 Mail • Mode of treatment. Mail. • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. In Table 10, 0.0033 (0.0102). B.4 Barton, Castillo and Petrie (2014) • Days after election the survey was taken. p. 306 indicates that the survey was taken during the week immediately following the election, so we assume 3 days on average. • Mode of measurement. Survey. • Election stage. General. • Seat. County commission. • Incumbency. Open seat. • Vote margin. This is difﬁcult to code because this is a multi-member district where multiple candidates won. Table 5 indicates the cooperating candidate received 32.9% of votes cast but that the candidate who performed the best and lost received 23.2% of the votes cast, for a margin of 32.9% - 23.2% = 9.7%. • Competitiveness. No. Democrats had held this seat for a decade and this Democratic candi- date won “overwhelmingly” (p. 307). B.4.1 Candidate Canvass • Mode of treatment. Candidate canvass. • Days after treatment the survey was taken. As shown in Figure 3, the candidate began cam- paigning about two months (71 days) before the election and canvassed evenly throughout. We therefore take the average of 35 days before the election. Since the surveys took place 3 days after the election on average, we enter this as 38 days. • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points.

B.6 Cardy (2005) • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. The control group had 192 individuals with 64% voting for the candidate. Across the four treatment groups there were 805 individuals with .693 ∗ 208 + .717 ∗ 215 + .66 ∗ 198 + .613 ∗ 184 = 542 individuals voting for the candidate, or 542/805 = 67.3%. Using STATA prtesti 192 .65 805 .673 yields 0.023 (0.038). • Days after election the survey was taken. The post-election survey date is not reported, so we assume 3 days. • Days after treatment the survey was taken. Across the four treatment groups, the most recent piece of mail was sent 6 days before the election and the most recent phone call occurred 7 days before the election. For our purposes, we use 6 days since most people received this mail, for a total number of days between treatment and survey of 9 days. • Mode of treatment. Mail and phone. • Mode of measurement.

B.8.1 Early Mailing, Early Effects • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. 0.0304 (0.0096). • Days after election the survey was taken. If we assume the survey was taken on August 20 and the election was on November 6, then the survey was taken 78 days before the election. • Days after treatment the survey was taken. The early mailing was sent in mid-August and the post-treatment surveys started three days after the second mailer was sent. This survey was conducted over several days. We therefore use 5 days. B.8.2 Early Mailing, Late Effects • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. -0.0066 (0.0206). • Days after election the survey was taken. If we assume the survey was taken on October 20 and the election was on November 6, then the survey was taken 17 days before the election. • Days after treatment the survey was taken.

B.9 Gerber (2004) B.9.1 Study 1 - New Jersey Assembly Race • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. The study reports effects on ‘vote margin,’ so we divide the estimates by 2 to get the equivalent effect in percentage points. In Sample 1 the vote margin estimate is 0.08 (0.11). In Sample 2 the vote margin estimate is -0.12 (0.12). Sample 3 is more complicated to compute. In Sample 3 (reported in Table 4) the control mean is -0.09 (0.09) and the two treatment means are -0.07 (0.13) and 0.12 (0.11). Combining the treatment means in Sample 3 leads to an overall treatment mean of 0.04 (0.08). The difference of means between this and the control mean is 0.04 - -0.09 = 0.13 with a standard error of √0.092 + 0.082 = .12, for an overall estimate of 0.13 (0.12) for Sample 3. Pooling Samples 1, 2, and 3, the pooled estimate and SE is 0.033 (0.067). Dividing by two since this is reported in vote margin terms, the overall pooled estimate is 0.016 (0.036). • Days after election the survey was taken. The paper describes the survey as post-election but does not specify a date. Consistent with other experiments, we assume 3 days after the election. • Days after treatment the survey was taken. The paper does not report the number of days before the election when the mail was sent. Consistent with Study 3, we assume the last mail was sent 1 week before the election, thus 10 days elapsed between treatment and survey. • Mode of treatment. Mail • Mode of measurement.

B.9.2 Study 2 - Connecticut State Legislative Race • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. The paper reports an estimate of -0.06 (0.08) in Sample 1 and an estimate of 0.07 (0.21) in Sample 2.

(2011) The standard errors for the radio and TV experiments are clustered because they were on the same subjects; the authors independently randomized these two modes. • Days after election the survey was taken. Despite this experiment taking place during the primary election, the main objective was the general election. The opposition candidate targeted was a general election candidate and the paper describes this time period as “the beginning of the general election campaign.” Therefore, if we take this experiment as run- ning in mid-January with a November 7 general election, this experiment occurred 296 days before the election. • Days after treatment the survey was taken.

B.10.1 TV Experiment in APSR Article • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. – Immediate: Using the ﬁnal column of Table 4 (what the authors call “the model that most closely reﬂects the nuances of the experimental design”), the effect of 1,000 TV GRPs was 0.0544 (0.0177) in percentage points. – One week later: The authors note in the text that the effects of the TV ads one week later is -0.0017 (0.0142): “a week later the effects of these ads have receded to 0.17 percentage points (SE = 1.42).” • Mode of treatment. TV. B.10.2 Analysis of Subsequent TV Quasi-Experiment Close to election day, the Rick Perry campaign conducted a follow-up quasi-experiment of the effect of their TV program. From September 5 through election day, the campaign conducted daily tracking surveys in each media market. There was natural variation in the assigned GRPs across market as they slowly increased their TV spending in advance of the election. In addition, they randomly assigned GRP levels in two of the media markets. Donald Green provided data on the tracking poll estimates and GRPs by media market by day. • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Using differences-in- differences with day and media market ﬁxed effects to estimate the effect of the TV ads, we estimate that each 1,000 GRPs of TV ads had an effect of 0.012 (SE = 0.018, clustered at the media market level). We do not separately analyze the experimental variation as with only two clusters it is impossible to estimate a standard error. • Mode of treatment. TV. B.10.3 Radio Experiment • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Using the ﬁnal column of Table 4 (what the authors call “the model that most closely reﬂects the nuances of the experimental design”), the effect of 1,000 radio GRPs was 0.0483 (0.0599) in percentage points. • Mode of treatment.

The authors note “Given that the difference in the share of households receiving mail in the two sorts of precincts is about 9.5 percentage points (= 0.170 − 0.076), this implies the estimated average treatment- on-the-treated effect of mail is about 29.0, 26.1, and 13.8 percentage points using the dif- ference, DD, and DDD estimates respectively, although only the DD estimate is statistically signiﬁcant at conventional levels” (p. 146). As it is the most rigorous estimate, we use the 13.8 percentage point treatment effect. The corresponding standard error is 18.1 ( 1.7 0.170−0.076) (because IT TD is 9.5 percentage points here). • Days after election the survey was taken. 0, precinct data. • Days after treatment the survey was taken.

B.24 Excluded Studies • Adams and Smith (1980) ﬁnd effects of their outreach on voter turnout but then condition post-treatment surveying on whether someone votes. It is also unclear from the text whether they re-interviewed the entire treatment and control groups who voted or conditioned on successful campaign contact within the treatment group. This study ﬁnds a null effect on vote choice. • Arceneaux and Nickerson (2010) does not include a control group in their study focusing on candidate choice (Study 1 focused on candidate choice and compared a positive and negative message group; Study 2 had a control group but was focused on ballot measure outcomes). • Gerber, Karlan and Bergan (2009) randomly assigned individuals to newspaper subscriptions to see if newspapers informed or persuaded individuals. This study was conducted long before a campaign and not in a campaign context nor of a campaign intervention, so we do not include it. • Niven (2013) does not include a control group. • Strauss (2009), Section 5.5.3, does not contain a control group. C Issue Campaign Meta-Analysis C.1 Arceneaux (2005) • Days after election the survey was taken. 0, precinct measurement. • Days after treatment the survey was taken.

Yes. 74 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 • Election Month, Year. November, 2003. • Vote margin on ballot measure. 46 points (73% yes, 27% no, citywide). • Competitiveness of ballot measure. Low. • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Arceneaux (2005) reports the marginal vote differential (MVD), which is the number of yes votes minus the number of no votes divided by the number of registered voters in each precinct. He reports an ITT of 0.9. To rescale this as the treatment effect on percent yes, we divide the ITT MVD by the average turnout rate and then by two (going from two-party vote share to percent yes). The average turnout rate of 31.3% can be calculated from Table 2, where turnout in the control precincts was 29.1% and turnout in the treatment precincts was 33.5%. We thus estimate the ITT effect on percent yes as: IT T = 0.9 2∗0.313 = 1.44. From Table 3, we can calculate the contact rate as 63%. Thus, the CACE is 1.44 0.63 = 2.3. Doing the same with the standard error (SE for MVD is also 0.9), gives us both a treatment effect and standard error of 2.3. • Mode of treatment. Canvass.

Treatment began September 9 and lasted through November 4. There was a ﬁnal canvass speciﬁcally from November 1-4, with Election Day on November 4. We therefore set the days between treatment and survey as 3. • Mode of measurement. Precinct. • During ballot measure campaign? Yes. • Election Month, Year. November, 2008 76 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 • Mode of treatment. Phone and canvass. The treatment consisted of up to four face-to-face visits and two phone calls. • Competitiveness of ballot measure. Yes. The authors describe these as competitive ballot measure ﬁghts where a signiﬁcant amount of money was spent. C.3.1 Afﬁrmative Action, Amendment 46 • Issue. Afﬁrmative action. • Vote margin on ballot measure. 2 points. • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. The authors report in Table 2 the number of no votes in control and treatment precincts, but do not directly report the treatment effect on percent voting no in percentage points. Fortunately, we can back this out. From Tables 1 and 3, we can estimate that the average number of votes cast in control and treatment precincts was 958 and 949, respectively (Control had 1340 prior registered voters, 48 new registered voters and a turnout rate of 69%. (1340 + 48) ∗ 0.69 = 958. Treatment had 1336 prior registered voters, 50 new registered voters and a turnout rate of 68.5%. (1336 + 50) ∗ 0.685 = 949.) Control had on average 90 no votes for a percent no of 90 958 = 9.4%. Treatment had on average 112 no votes for a percent no of 112 949 = 11.8%. We can therefore estimate the treatment effect in percentage points as 11.8 − 9.4 = 2.4 percentage points. To estimate the standard error, we know from Table 2 that the p-value of this estimate is 0.0019. This gives a Z value of ABS(N ORM SIN V (0.0019/2)) = 3.105. By dividing the treatment effect by this Z value, we get a standard error of 0.77 percentage points. We then adjust by the 57% contact rate, to get a treatment effect of 4.2 percentage points and SE of 1.35 percentage points. C.3.2 Closed Shops, Amendment 47 • Issue. Closed shops. • Vote margin on ballot measure. 11 points. • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Using the above ap- proach, control had on average 235 no votes for a percent no of 235 958 = 24.5%. Treatment had on average 249 no votes for a percent no of 249 949 = 26.2%. We can therefore estimate the treatment effect in percentage points as 26.2 − 24.5 = 1.7 percentage points. To estimate the standard error, we know from Table 2 that the p-value of this estimate is 0.11. This gives a Z value of ABS(N ORM SIN V (0.11/2)) = 1.598. By dividing the treatment effect by this Z value, we get a standard error of 1.06 percentage points. We then adjust by the 57% contact rate, to get a treatment effect of 3.0 percentage points and SE of 1.86 percentage points. 77 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 C.3.3 Fetus Personhood, Amendment 48 • Issue. Fetus personhood. • Vote margin on ballot measure. 46 points. • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Using the above ap- proach, control had on average 308 no votes for a percent no of 308 958 = 32.2%. Treatment had on average 340 no votes for a percent no of 340 949 = 35.8%. We can therefore estimate the treatment effect in percentage points as 35.8 − 32.2 = 3.6 percentage points. To estimate the standard error, we know from Table 2 that the p-value of this estimate is 0.03. This gives a Z value of ABS(N ORM SIN V (0.03/2)) = 2.170. By dividing the treatment effect by this Z value, we get a standard error of 1.7 percentage points. We then adjust by the 57% contact rate, to get a treatment effect of 6.3 percentage points and SE of 3.0 percentage points. C.3.4 Payroll Deductions, Amendment 49 • Issue. Payroll deductions. • Vote margin on ballot measure. 22 points. • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Using the above ap- proach, control had on average 243 no votes for a percent no of 243 958 = 25.4%. Treatment had on average 263 no votes for a percent no of 263 949 = 27.7%. We can therefore estimate the treatment effect in percentage points as 27.7 − 25.4 = 2.3 percentage points. To estimate the standard error, we know from Table 2 that the p-value of this estimate is 0.02. This gives a Z value of ABS(N ORM SIN V (0.02/2)) = 2.326. By dividing the treatment effect by this Z value, we get a standard error of 0.99 percentage points. We then adjust by the 57% contact rate, to get a treatment effect of 4.0 percentage points and SE of 1.7 percentage points. C.3.5 Campaign Donations, Amendment 54 • Issue. Campaign donations. • Vote margin on ballot measure. 2 points. • Treatment effect estimate and standard error in percentage points. Using the above ap- proach, control had on average 82 no votes for a percent no of 82 958 = 8.6%. Treatment had on average 99 no votes for a percent no of 99 949 = 10.4%. We can therefore estimate the treatment effect in percentage points as 10.4 − 8.6 = 1.8 percentage points. To estimate the standard error, we know from Table 2 that the p-value of this estimate is 0.01. This gives a Z value of ABS(N ORM SIN V (0.01/2)) = 2.576. By dividing the treatment effect by this Z value, we get a standard error of 0.70 percentage points. We then adjust by the 57% contact rate, to get a treatment effect of 3.2 percentage points and SE of 1.2 percentage points. 78 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 C.4 Rogers and Middleton (2015) • Days after election the survey was taken. 0, precinct. • Days after treatment the survey was taken.

Unfortunately given the number of experiments we discuss and our desire to be fully transparent, this is unavoidable. The key details of the experiments necessary for interpretation should all appear in the main text. Overview In this appendix, we describe the seven original ﬁeld experiments, two diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences quasi- experiments, and two GOTV experiments that we conducted during the 2015 and 2016 election cycles. All of these experiments were conducted with the same partner organization, Working America, the community aﬃliate of the AFL-CIO. Working America uses paid canvassers to go door-to-door persuading voters to support their endorsed candidates (typically Democrats) and encouraging voter turnout. Each of these experiments followed a standard model, using the online panel plus placebo procedure described in Broockman, Kalla, and Sekhon (2017): 1. Working America would deﬁne an experimental universe of voters they believed to be persuadable. 2. A polling division would then send these voters a letter encouraging them to participate in a paid, online survey. This survey would include multiple questions on political, social, and local issues. Neither 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 the survey nor the letter would mention Working America. As part of the survey, the polling division would then collect the voters’ cell phone numbers and email addresses. 3. Among the voters who completed the survey and provided their contact information, Working America would randomly assign half to a treatment group that would be canvassed with Working America’s typical persuasion message and half to a placebo group that would receive an unrelated canvass, typically on ascertaining sources of news consumption. The placebo contained no persuasion messaging and was only used to identify compliers, those voters who, had they been in treatment, would have opened their doors. 4. Working America would send the polling division the list of compliers. The polling division would then resurvey the compliers several days after the initial canvass with a similar survey on political, social, and local issues. 5. Working America would then send the authors the survey data to conduct analyses of their canvassing. In the experimental analyses, we followed two standard procedures from Broockman, Kalla, and Sekhon (2017): 1. The surveys typically included multiple questions on the race that was the subject of the persuasion eﬀort. Typically, these questions were a horse-race and a candidate favorability question for both the Democrat and Republican. When multiple questions were available, we would combine them into a single index designed to reduce measurement error. In all cases, we take the ﬁrst dimension from the factor analysis output, then rescale this factor such that the placebo group has a mean 0 and standard deviation of 1. This allows us to interpret the treatment eﬀects as the eﬀect in standard deviations the treatment would have among an untreated population. The factor analysis and rescaling code came from the supplementary materials of Broockman and Kalla (2016). 2. Our main analysis for each experiment was always a regression of the factor (described above) on a treatment indicator and a set of pre-treatment covariates, with household-level cluster-robust standard errors. The pre-treatment covariates used were always the same as those used in Working America’s balance tests before canvassing. The use of pre-treatment covariates that are highly predictive of the outcome noticeably decreases sampling variability and increases statistical power. PA Experiment, 2015, Mayor Primary This experiment was conducted during the 2015 Philadelphia mayoral Democratic primary. Working America canvassed to increase support for Jim Kenney. Canvassing took place from 4/6/15-4/9/15. An initial post-treatment survey took place from 4/11/15-4/15/15. A second follow-up post-treatment survey took place from 5/14/15-5/18/15. The election was held on 5/19/15. Experimental Universe Below, we describe the representativeness of the experimental universe. This ﬁrst table compares the responders to the initial post-treatment survey to everyone who was canvassed.

Each cell reports the average value of a diﬀerent covariate at each stage. t0_pid is the standard 7-point party ID variable, with higher values for stronger Democrats. t0_identify_afam is a binary variable, coded as 1 if the survey responded identiﬁed as African American. t0_identify_poc is a similar binary variable, but for any non-white person of color. Vote choice variables are typically 7-point scales, with higher values for the Democrat. Favorability variables are 7-pint scales, with higher values more favorable. Finally, n refers to the number of individals at each stage. This second table compares the responders to the second follow-up post-treatment survey to everyone who was canvassed.

Finally, n refers to the number of individals at each stage. Tests of Covariate Balance and Diﬀerential Attrition Below, we report covariate balance across treatment and placebo at each of three stages: at the time of canvassing, at the time of the initial post-treatment survey, and at the time of the follow-up post-treatment survey. We do this by regressing a treatment indicator on all of the covariates. Each p-value reports whether that covariate is predictive of treatment assignment. In expectation, from random assignment, the covariates should be independent of treatment assignment. As a summary statistics, we also report the F-statistic from this multivariate regression. This table shows covariate balance among everyone canvassed. Table 3: Test of covariate balance. F-statistic from this multivariate regression is 0.616.

Working America canvassed to increase support for Carol Gregory. Gregory was appointed to ﬁll the seat after Roger Freeman passed away. The special election was held to determine who would hold the seat for the remainder of Freeman’s term. Canvassing took place from 9/14/15-9/23/15. An initial post-treatment survey took place from 9/17/15- 10/3/15. A second follow-up post-treatment survey took place from 11/5/15-11/14/15. The election was held on 11/3/15.

Tests of Covariate Balance and Diﬀerential Attrition Below, we report covariate balance across treatment and placebo at each of three stages: at the time of canvassing, at the time of the initial post-treatment survey, and at the time of the follow-up post-treatment survey. We do this by regressing a treatment indicator on all of the covariates. Each p-value reports whether that covariate is predictive of treatment assignment. In expectation, from random assignment, the covariates should be independent of treatment assignment. As a summary statistics, we also report the F-statistic from this multivariate regression.

Results This table shows the experimental results of the canvass, as measured in the initial post-treatment survey. We present results both controlling for the pre-treatment covariates used in the test of covariate balance and without.

This was a distinct experimental universe from the ﬁrst test. Working America canvassed to increase support for Ted Strickland and Hillary Clinton. Canvassing took place from 8/27/16-9/9/16. An initial post-treatment survey took place from 8/30/16-9/16/16. A second follow-up post-treatment survey took place from 11/8/16. The election was held on 11/8/16. Experimental Universe Below, we describe the representativeness of the experimental universe. This table compares the responders to the initial post-treatment survey to everyone who was canvassed.

Vote choice variables are typically 7-point scales, with higher values for the Democrat. Favorability variables are 7-pint scales, with higher values more favorable.

Finally, n refers to the number of individals at each stage. Tests of Covariate Balance and Diﬀerential Attrition Below, we report covariate balance across treatment and placebo at each of three stages: at the time of canvassing, at the time of the initial post-treatment survey, and at the time of the follow-up post-treatment survey. We do this by regressing a treatment indicator on all of the covariates. Each p-value reports whether that covariate is predictive of treatment assignment. In expectation, from random assignment, the covariates should be independent of treatment assignment. As a summary statistics, we also report the F-statistic from this multivariate regression. This table shows covariate balance among everyone canvassed. Table 26: Test of covariate balance. F-statistic from this multivari- ate regression is 0.984.

An initial post-treatment survey took place from 9/30/16-10/31/16. The election was held on 11/8/16. Experimental Universe Below, we describe the representativeness of the experimental universe. This table compares the responders to the initial post-treatment survey to everyone who was canvassed.

Each cell reports the average value of a diﬀerent covariate at each stage. t0_pid is the standard 7-point party ID variable, with higher values for stronger Democrats. t0_identify_afam is a binary variable, coded as 1 if the survey responded identiﬁed as African American. t0_identify_poc is a similar binary variable, but for any non-white person of color. Vote choice variables are typically 7-point scales, with higher values for the Democrat. Favorability variables are 7-pint scales, with higher values more favorable. Finally, n refers to the number of individals at each stage. Tests of Covariate Balance and Diﬀerential Attrition Below, we report covariate balance across treatment and placebo at each of two stages: at the time of canvassing and at the time of the initial post-treatment survey. We do this by regressing a treatment indicator on all of the covariates. Each p-value reports whether that covariate is predictive of treatment assignment. In expectation, from random assignment, the covariates should be independent of treatment assignment. As a summary statistics, we also report the F-statistic from this multivariate regression. This table shows covariate balance among everyone canvassed. Table 36: Test of covariate balance. F-statistic from this multivari- ate regression is 0.388.

With more than 26 years of judicial experience and 24 years of teaching tenure, Superior Court Judge Michael Morgan has a long record of serving North Carolina. A Raleigh resident, Morgan began his career with the NC Department of Justice and then went on to become a state administrative law judge before becoming a district court judge in 1994. (2016 Supreme Court primary election guide) Democracy: The North Carolina Supreme Court is an important guardian of our democracy. The Supreme Court presides over cases where politically motivated laws are passed, like when Republican-led lawmakers used race to draw legislative boundaries in 2011, giving their party the edge by diluting African-American votes. More recently, the court reviewed a new election retention law that made it so that sitting justices seeking election would not have to face challengers. We need justices who believe that the judiciary should be fair and impartial. (wral.com, 8/11/16; The News & Observer, 6/7/16; Indy Week, 5/18/16) Judge Michael Morgan has lamented the politicization of the North Carolina judicial system. As a jurist, Morgan has met the high standards of fairness and impartiality. On a North Carolina Bar Association judicial performance survey, he received an impressive score of 4.47 out of 5 for integrity and impartiality, placing him in the top quarter for all North Carolina superior court judges. (The Outer Banks Voice, 6/5/16; North Carolina Bar Association Survey, 3/12) Economy: The North Carolina Supreme Court is critical in deciding pocketbook issues that affect all of us, like scrutinizing rate increases by big utility companies that ignore the impact on homes and small businesses. The current court’s conservative majority has ruled in favor of the big utility companies, but we need justices who put economic fairness for working families first. (The News & Observer, 1/23/15 and 6/26/15) Judge Michael Morgan is endorsed by North Carolina AFL-CIO, which represents over 100,000 working people fighting for good jobs, safe workplaces, workers’ rights, consumer protections and quality public services on behalf of all working families. (aflcionc.org, accessed 9/7/16) Education: The North Carolina Supreme Court is critical to deciding issues that affect our state’s education system. Whether the issue is the use of public taxpayer money to fund private schools through a controversial voucher system or supporting and retaining quality teachers when we need them the most, we need justices who will put our children first. (MintPress News, 7/28/15; Greensboro News & Record, 4/15/16) Having spent 24 years as an educator and having served on the board of directors for a children’s home, Judge Michael Morgan has shown that he values education and that we can count on him to put North Carolina’s children first.

These funds will create 43,000 health care jobs and bring more than $2 billion in federal money every year. Cooper also vowed to repeal the job-killing legislation, House Bill 2, and restore the child-care tax credit to help working families. (Charlotte Business Journal, 7/13/16; NCJustice.org, accessed 8/23/16) AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM WORKING AMERICA Roy Cooper for Governor Roy Cooper (D) Who Will Stand with Working Families? Pat McCrory (R) Gov. McCrory signed House Bill 2 into law. This legislation has harmed North Carolina’s economy and pushed out jobs. As a result of HB 2, our state has lost over $40 million in business investment—resulting in a loss of over 1,250 jobs. An additional $20 million in business investment and 550 more jobs are at risk. (PolitiFact.com, 4/22/16; The Williams Institute, 5/11/16) CREATING JOBS HEALTHIER NORTH CAROLINA INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE North Carolina’s unemployment rate is now less than half of what it was during the height of the recession, but the current rate of 4.7% still leaves the state ranked 25th in the nation, lagging behind neighboring states like Tennessee and Virginia, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Bls.gov, retrieved 8/25/16) North Carolina has the opportunity to provide health care access to an additional 500,000 people by expanding Medicaid through existing health care legislation. Not only would this save the state $318 million between 2016-2020, it would create 43,000 new jobs in the next four years. (NCJustice.org, accessed 8/23/16) North Carolina ranks 42nd when it comes to school ﬁnance, a ranking based on funding equity and spending. The effects of this ranking are ampliﬁed when you consider that states with higher per-pupil expenditures tend to have higher student achievement. In North Carolina, we spend $2,792 less than the national average for each of our students. (EdWeek: Quality Counts 2016; NEA.org, accessed 8/16/16) Roy Cooper is a vocal advocate for the expansion of Medicaid. Out of the 500,000 North Carolinians this expansion would provide coverage for, more than 300,000 have no other insurance option available. Accepting this expansion would help prevent more than 1,000 unnecessary deaths and save 14,776 families from receiving catastrophic medical bills. (The News and Observer, 6/23/16; NCJustice.org, accessed 8/23/16) Our state ranks 42nd in the nation for teacher pay and 14.8 percent of our teachers left their positions in 2015 alone. Roy Cooper is committed to making education a priority in North Carolina by raising teacher salaries to the national average, boosting kindergarten funding and helping to ease student loan debt. (Abc11.com, 5/3/16; The Citizen-Times, 3/9/16) Pat McCrory refused to expand Medicaid, which would help 27,044 diabetics get their medication and provide 40,000 North Carolinian women preventative screening. By doing this, Gov. McCrory is also leaving $2 billion on the table every year, which could ease the financial strain on our hospitals. Four hospitals in Georgia and one hospital in Virginia have already closed due to their state’s refusal to expand Medicaid. (The News and Observer, 6/23/16; NCJustice.org, accessed 8/23/16; HealthInsurance.org, accessed 8/23/16) Though North Carolina has fallen behind in school investment, Gov. McCrory supports legislation that puts $4.7 billion in federal education funding in jeopardy. Our state uses these federal funds to pay teachers and aids, subsidize nutrition programs for low- income students, support economically disadvantaged students, and assist students with disabilities.

Working America canvassed to increase support for Chris Koster. Canvassing took place from 9/30/16-10/15/16. An initial post-treatment survey took place from 10/18/16-11/1/16. The election was held on 11/8/16. Experimental Universe Below, we describe the representativeness of the experimental universe.

Each cell reports the average value of a diﬀerent covariate at each stage. t0_pid is the standard 7-point party ID variable, with higher values for stronger Democrats. t0_identify_afam is a binary variable, coded as 1 if the survey responded identiﬁed as African American. t0_identify_poc is a similar binary variable, but for any non-white person of color. Vote choice variables are typically 7-point scales, with higher values for the Democrat. Favorability variables are 7-pint scales, with higher values more favorable. Finally, n refers to the number of individals at each stage. Tests of Covariate Balance and Diﬀerential Attrition Below, we report covariate balance across treatment and placebo at each of two stages: at the time of canvassing and at the time of the initial post-treatment survey. We do this by regressing a treatment indicator on all of the covariates. Each p-value reports whether that covariate is predictive of treatment assignment. In expectation, from random assignment, the covariates should be independent of treatment assignment. As a summary statistics, we also report the F-statistic from this multivariate regression. This table shows covariate balance among everyone canvassed. Table 49: Test of covariate balance. F-statistic from this multivari- ate regression is 0.335.

Canvassing took place from 24 October 2016 through Election Day, 8 November 2016. Experimental Universe The experiment consisted of 515752 people randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: a GOTV canvass, a placebo canvass, and a pure control group. Randomization was conducted based on the number of registered voters in a precinct. In precincts with over 1,000 registered voters, approximately 10% of households were randomly assigned to control, 5% to placebo, and 85% to treatment. In precincts with less than 1,000 registered voters, approximately 5% of households were randomly assigned to placebo and 95% to treatment.

To estimate a complier average causal eﬀect (CACE) pooled across the two types of precincts, we compare the turnout rates among just those voters canvassed in the treatment and placebo conditions. We do this by regressing turnout on an indicator for treatment and an indicator for precinct type (more or less than 1,000 voters). In one model, we also include covariates from the 2015, 2014, 2012, 2010, 2008, and 2006 general elections and the 2016 primary election. As stated in Version 1.05 of Standard operating procedures for Don Green’s lab at Columbia, “If the PAP fails to specify the choice of covariates for regression adjustment or for the test of covariate balance, the default set of covariates will include voter turnout in all past elections for which data are available in the voter ﬁle, excluding any elections in which turnout rates in the subject pool were below 5%.” http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/acoppock/Green-Lab-SOP/blob/master/ Green_Lab_SOP.html. Furthermore, all standard errors are cluster-robust at the household level, which was the unit of treatment assignment. Without covariates, we estimate a treatment eﬀect of 2.31 (SE = 1.04). With covariates, we estimate a treatment eﬀect of 1.86 (SE = 0.9). This allows us to conclude that Working America’s GOTV canvass increased turnout with a CACE of approximately 2 percentage points. To contextualize this, Table A-2 of Green and Gerber (2015) presents a meta-analysis of the CACE eﬀects for door-to-door GOTV canvassing by base rate of turnout in the control group. Their meta-analysis suggests that the average CACE in a race when the turnout rate in the control group is between 50-70% is 1.4 percentage points (in this NC experiment, it was 68% among compliers in the placebo group). Thus, the Working America GOTV eﬀect of 2 percentage points is apprximately 43% more eﬀective than the average eﬀect. MO GOTV Experiment, 2016 Using a distinct experimental universe but the same canvassers, Working America conducted a voter turnout experiment in the 2016 general election in Missouri. Canvassing took place from 25 October 2016 through Election Day, 8 November 2016. As we discuss more below, this experiment suﬀered from an implementation error which led to covariate imbalance between the compliers in the treatment and placebo groups. We therefore excluded this experiment from the main text. Experimental Universe The experiment consisted of 89271 people randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: a GOTV canvass, a placebo canvass, and a pure control group. 68 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 Randomization was conducted by city. In the city of St. Louis, approximately 20% of households were randomly assigned to control, 5% to placebo, and 75% to treatment. In the county of St. Louis, approximately 40% of households were randomly assigned to control, 5% of households were randomly assigned to placebo and 55% to treatment. Note that we do not have party registration data for Missouri.

The diﬀerences in voter turnout between treatment and placebo on the 2014, 2012, and 2006 general elections are worrisome, suggesting some imbalance in treatment delivery.

To estimate a complier average causal eﬀect (CACE) pooled across the two types of precincts, we compare the turnout rates among just those voters canvassed in the treatment and placebo conditions. We do this by regressing turnout on an indicator for treatment and an indicator for St Louis City or County. In one model, we also include covariates from the 2014, 2012, 2010, 2008, and 2006 general elections and the 2016 primary election, following the same PAP plan details discussed above. Furthermore, all standard errors are cluster-robust at the household level, which was the unit of treatment assignment. Without covariates, we estimate a treatment eﬀect of -1.17 (SE = 2.27). With covariates, we estimate a treatment eﬀect of -0.19 (SE = 2.18). Nevertheless, we urge caution when interpreting these results given the covariate imbalance discussed above. Identiﬁcation Strategy for Diﬀerence-in-Diﬀerences The diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence studies included ﬁve waves of surveys conducted over the ﬁnal weeks of the campaign, with the ﬁnal wave on election day. Our analyses estimated the following equation: yi,t = γt + τ wi,t + αi + µi,t, t = 0, . . . , 4; i = 1, . . . , N, where γt is an indicator for the time period, wi,t is an indicator for whether individual i was canvassed before t (such that as soon as a voter is canvassed between t − 1 and t, this indicator is set to 1 and then is then always coded as canvassed thereafter), αi is an individual-level ﬁxed eﬀect, µi,t are the idiosyncratic errors clustered at the individual level, and τ is the treatment eﬀect of canvassing that we are estimating. Below, we present placebo tests of the parallel trends assumption and additional robustness tests. The identiﬁcation strategy of the diﬀerences- in-diﬀerences designs rests on the fact that we have precise measures of voters’ preferences both before and after they were contacted and a large group of voters who happened never to be con- tacted that allow us to estimate how the electorate’s opinions were changing over time regardless. Importantly, in these diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences studies, we observe which voters the partner group actually contacted and are not relying on voter self-reports of campaign contact. NC Diﬀerence-in-Diﬀerences, 2016, President, Senate, Governor, Supreme Court For this analysis, we conducted 5 waves of a panel survey, with treatment canvasses delivered throughout. The ﬁrst wave was conducted around September 20 (n=6,202). The second wave was conducted from 21-29 October (n=3,070). The third wave was conducted from 28 October - 1 November (n=2,876). The fourth wave was conducted from 1-7 November (n=3,285). The ﬁnal wave was conducted from 8-9 November (n=2,857). Canvassing took place from 26 September - 8 November. For every individual, we know the date when Working America attempted them and when they were successfully canvassed. This allows us to compare the 72 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042867 change over time in vote choice among those canvassed to those not canvassed using a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences analysis. Universe The experiment included 6,202 unique individuals. 20% identify as African American, 47% are Democrats, 6% are Republicans, and the remainder are not registered with a party. 15% were attempted with a canvass by Working America and, of those, 15% were successfully canvassed. Tests of Trends Assumption First, we regress the lagged outcome on an indicator for whether or not an individual is ever canvassed. In each table, we regress the lagged dependent variable from the time period before the individual was canvassed and compare those individuals to everyone who was never canvassed. Standard errors are reported in parantheses. Note that we do not report results for those individuals canvassed between t0 and t1 because this would be the diﬀerence in means at the baseline of t0 rather than a within-subject change.

Thinking about the current presidential election, if the presidential election were being held today between Democrat Hillary Clinton, Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who would you vote for? 2. Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Hillary Clinton? 3. Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Donald Trump? Senate: 1. Do you approve or disapprove of the way Rob Portman is handling his job as senator? 2. Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Ted Strickland? 3. Ohio also has a Senate election this fall between current Senator Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Ted Strickland. How do you plan on voting? 4. When it comes to representing Ohio in the U.S. Senate, which candidate do you think is best qualiﬁed, Democrat Ted Strickland or Republican Rob Portman? Results Below, we present results where we compare the eﬀect of being canvassed on our two outcome measures. In the ﬁrst column, we compare those canvassed to all voters who took the baseline survey. In the second column, we compare those canvassed only to those attempted with a canvass by Working America. In all cases, we include time period and individual ﬁxed eﬀects and cluster standard errors at the individual level. Cluster-robust standard errors are reported in parantheses. The eﬀect of canvassing on president is statistically signiﬁcant, but substantively small. Given the greater likelihood of bias under the diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences assumptions than under those of the randomized experiments, we urge caution when interpreting these results.
