METHOD FOR DETECTION OF PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING VA INTERROGATION OF SMART METER DATA FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to plug-in electric vehicles, advanced metering infrastructure (Smart meters), utility load analysis, and the generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure necessary to integrate these vehicles into utilities existing electrical grids. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There is an increasing interest in PEVs (plug-in electric vehicles), particularly with the introduction in 2011 of the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt. The Nissan Leaf is a purely electric car that requires no gasoline and provides the consumer with a 100-mile driving range per charge. The Chevrolet Volt is a PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) which extends its electric driving range with a gasoline gen erator. Owners can charge the Nissan Leaf and the Chevy Volt using either a 240V or 120V power supply. Charging at 240 V requires a separate infrastructure (EVSE) that supplies elec tric energy for charging electric Vehicles and plug-in hybrids, while 120V charging can be done from a regular house outlet. Though the chargers are similar for all EVs, there are several differences between the battery sizes of various EVs. For example, the Leaf has a battery size of 24kWh while the Volt battery is at 16 kWh. Fully charging a Leafat 240V/16 A requires around 6.5 hours while charging at 3.7kW, whereas fully charging a Volt at 240V/16 amps requires around 4 hours while charging at 3.7 kW. On the other hand, charging at 120V takes Substantially, longer, as approximately 20 hours are required to fully charge the Leafat 1.4kW, while approxi mately 11.5 hours are requires to completely charge the Volt at 1.4 kW. On average, a typical household draws 0.7 kWh of load from their local power utility. This might consist of typical household appliances such as washers, dryers, ovens, etc. However, the household load can change depending on sev eral variables, notably weather related HVAC usage. There may also be luxury variables Such as pools, spas and on-site PV (photovoltaic) generation. In contrast, an EV can draw up to 3.7kW per hour. This presents a problem because one EV owner alone can indirectly add 4 households worth of load to a service transformer, which can place that transformer at risk of being seriously overloaded. Modern transformers can withstand a certain degree of overloading, however as the popularity and adoption of PEVs grows, the risk of multiple PEVs clustered on a single transformer will increase that risk. Moreover, the next generation of PEVs are poised to come out with bigger batteries that require higher kWh charging, fur ther heightening the risk to, transformers. When buying a PEV, the consumer has no obligation to inform the utility company of their purchase. As a result, Some utility companies have initiated programs where cus tomers can work with the utility to benefit from special power pricing structures, and utilities can be made aware of the additional load to their grid. For example, San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) has participated in the federally funded EV Project; this project works with different utility compa nies to help provide new PEV customers with free 24OV chargers. In addition, SDG&E has put most of these custom ers on special billing rates that incentivize owners to charge during off-peak hours. Knowing the location of the PEVs, SDG&E is thenable to monitor load on the infrastructure that 10 15 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 2 serves that customer. This situational awareness allows the utility to limit power interruptions and to preserve power quality. Additionally, knowing the location of electric vehicles facilitates programs such as demand response to shut off charging when the grid is under stress, and Smart Grid applications such as Vehicle-to-Grid distributed energy stor age. As incentive programs such as these come to an end, it is increasingly difficult for utilities to keep track of the influx of PEVs to their grid. As such, it is incumbent upon the utilities to employ advanced methods of tracking electric Vehicle charging. BRIEF SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed toward an algorithm that employs a specific logic structure to interrogate interval con Sumption data. In most utilities having an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), meter data is reported in either 15-minute or hourly intervals, and only kWh information is transmitted. Future versions of meter technology may allow for more densely sampled time intervals or other data such as Voltage and current. Relying strictly on hourly interval reads and kWh data, the algorithm set forth herein scans through real-time or archival data sets to identify load signatures indicative of electric vehicle charging. The algorithm relies on four parameters to identify charg ing events: 1) a threshold level of total kWh consumption; 2) a defined duration at which kWh consumption remains above this threshold; 3) a leading edge increase in kWh consump tion; and 4) a lagging edge decrease in kWh consumption. The specific numeric value for each of these parameters is flexible and is determined as a function of several variables including, but not limited to: Vehicle type, charging behavior to be monitored, time of year, climate Zone, and presence of photovoltaic generation at the premise. The accuracy with which the algorithm can discriminate between actual electric Vehicle charging events and other electric loads is also a function of vehicle type and charging behavior. These factors lead the algorithm to be most useful for identifying premises that have installed EVSE hardware and where PEVs are routinely charged. However, it is antici pated that increasingly larger PEV batteries and faster charg ing will be the norm. Additionally, future AMI implementa tions are likely to have higher sampling rates. Both of these developments will improve the accuracy of real time moni toring and individual charging event identification based on this algorithm. One embodiment of the invention involves a non-transitory computer readable medium having computer executable pro gram code embodied thereon, the computer executable pro gram code configured to cause a computing device to detect a PEV charging event at a residence through signal processing analysis of interval consumption data for the residence. The computer executable program code may further be config ured to cause the computing device to detect a beginning, end, magnitude and/or duration of the charging event using a pre determined set of parameters. In some embodiments of the above method, the predeter mined set of parameters is selected to accommodate a par ticular model of PEV. According to further embodiments, the predetermined set of parameters is selected to accommodate various modes including DC fast charging of charging and associated EVSEs. In one implementation, the computer executable program code may further be configured to distin guish a PEV charging event from another load. Additionally, the computer executable program code is further configured US 9,156,368 B2 3 to identify a PEV charging event as occurring either on-peak or off-peak. In further embodiments, the computer executable program code is further configured to identify the residence with PEV charging by a pattern of repeated charging. According to various embodiments of the above method, the computer executable program code is further configured to assign a charging rate to the residence with PEV charging, wherein the charging rate is expressed as charging events per unit time. In some cases, the computer executable program code may further be configured to subject identified resi dences to probabilistic ranking to identify PEV owners. In Some embodiments, the computer executable program code is further configured to subject identified residences to proba bilistic ranking to identify PEV owners. In addition, the com puter executable program code may further be configured to apply database query language to archival and/or real time data for retrospective analysis. In some embodiments, the computer executable program code can be further configured to convert resulting information to a GIS mapping of PEV events and owners.

FIG. 1 is a chart showing whole house power consumption (meter interval data) in kWh overlaid with PEV specific power consumption, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The owner of the house was a known Nissan Leaf owner and meter interval data was collected hourly for the period of one week. The chart demonstrates patterns indicative of PEV charging events. Data from a whole house meter (\"+\") that measures total kWh consump tion (including the PEV) has prominent peaks above 4.0 kWh. that last for multiple consecutive hours. These peaks are suspected PEV charging events and can be confirmed by overlaying data from a dedicated submeter (“ ”) that only measures PEV power consumption. To identify the charging events of a Nissan Leaf at a premise that lacks a dedicated PEV submeter, the four param eters of the algorithm can be set to specific values optimized for interrogation of whole house meters. FIG. 2 is a chart illustrating the anatomy of a PEV charging event, in accor dance with an embodiment of the present invention. Specifi cally, the chart is a plot of two individual charging events with whole house power consumption in kWh (\"+\") overlaid with PEV specific power consumption (“ ”). The parameters for charging event detection include: (A) Threshold, (B) Dura tion, (C) Leading Edge, and (D) Lagging Edge. These param eters are depicted in FIG. 2. In some embodiments the Threshold parameter requires that total power consumption including the EV must exceed 3.5 kWH, while the Duration parameter requires that total power consumption remain above this Threshold for no less than 2 hours and no more than 5 hours. In addition, the Leading Edge parameter may require that the total power consumption rise by no less than 2.9 kWh between interval n and interval n+2, whereas the Lagging Edge parameter may require that the total power consumption fall by no less than 3.1 kWh between two subsequent intervals n and n+2. To identify a premise that has an EVSE installed and where PEVs are routinely charged, meter data is observed for a period of time. From observation of known Nissan Leafown ers, it was demonstrated that these premises experience a minimum number of charging events per unit time, expressed as events per day. Setting a threshold for minimum events per day of 0.2 allows for nearly complete discrimination of PEV owners from Non-Owners. FIG. 3 is a table of charging event 10 15 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 6 rates, in accordance with an embodiment of the present inven tion. PEV owners (indicated with an “X” or “” next to the meter number) have rates greater than 0.2 events per day. Non-Owners (indicated with a \"+” or '-' next to the meter number) have rates less than 0.2 events per day. Further metrics are applied that eliminate highly consistent charging durations indicative of loads that are not truly PEVs. A series of metrics including, but not limited to geography, demo graphics and false positive rates, may also be employed to rank the probability of any candidate owner identified by the algorithm. An algorithmic logic structure was constructed that allows the writing of standard query logic (SQL) or other query language that may be used to interrogate large data sets in eithera real-time or archival fashion. FIG. 4 is a flowchart 100 of the algorithmic logic structure for interval data by indi vidual meter, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, interval data by individual meter enters at operation 102. Operation 104 involves deter mining whether the data is from the month of January, Feb ruary, March, April, May, June, October, November or December. If not, the method proceeds to operation 106 indi cating the data is from July, August or September, and the same logic is applied, but using different parameters (opera tion 108). If operation 104 is answered with a “yes” the method proceeds to operation 110, which checks whether the interval (INT) is greater than 3.5. If not, the interval is increased in operation 114 and the method proceeds again to operation 104. If so, the method proceeds to operation 116, which checks whether INT+1)-3.5. If not, the interval is increased in operation 114 and the method proceeds again to operation 104. If so, the method proceeds to operation 120, which checks whether INT-(INT-2)>2.9. If not, the method pro ceeds to operation 144. If so, the method proceeds to opera tion 122, which checks whether (INT+1)-(INT+3)>3.1. If so, an event has occurred at operation 124 and an event counter records the event at operation 126. With further reference to FIG. 4, operation 128 involves determining whether this is the end of specific meter data for this individual meter. If not, the method proceeds to operation 114 and the interval is incremented. If so, the method pro ceeds to operation 132, which determines whether duration consistency is greater than 85%. If not, the method proceeds to operation 134, which determines whether the charging event rate is greater than 0.28 and less than 1.5. If so, the algorithm determines the presence of an electric Vehicle owner (operation 136). However, ifoperation 132 determines than duration consistency is not greater than 85%, or if opera tion 134 determines that the charging event rate is not greater than 0.28 or is not less than 1.5, then the algorithm determines that the household does not include an electric vehicle owner (operation 138). Operation 144 involves determining whether (INT+1)- (INT-1)>2.9. If not, the method proceeds to operation 145 and the interval is incremented. If so, the method proceeds to operation 146, which checks whether INT+2>3.1. If not, the method proceeds to operation 145 and the interval is incre mented. If so, the method proceeds to operation 148, which checks whether (INT+2)-(INT+4)>3.1. If so, an event has occurred at operation 150 and the event counter records the event at operation 126. If not, the algorithm proceeds to operation 154, which determines whether INT+3-3.5. If not, the method proceeds to operation 145 and the interval is incremented. If so, the method proceeds to operation 158, which checks whether (INT+3)-(INT+5)>3.1. If so, an event has occurred at operation 159 and the event counter records US 9,156,368 B2 7 the event at operation 126. If not, the algorithm proceeds to operation 160, which determines whether INT+4-3.5. If not, the method proceeds to operation 145 and the interval is incremented. If so, the method proceeds to operation 162, which checks whether (INT+4)-(INT+6)>3.1. If not, the 5 method proceeds to operation 145 and the interval is incre mented. If so, an event has occurred at operation 164 and the event counter records the event at operation 126. In Summary, the algorithm queries interval data to deter mine when charging events occur (i.e., at operations...). The 10 algorithm outputs PEV owners (at operation . . . ) based on charging rates, i.e. events per unit time. Though the values for each parameter in this example are set to detect charging of a Nissan Leaf, they can be changed to search for other vehicle types (present or future) or other charging behaviors without 15 departing from the scope of the present invention.
