However, identifying supporters and opponents of a candidate’s policy positions is far from foolproof. This reality results in some citizens encountering political message(s) on congruent issues, where their issue stance aligns with the messaging candidate, and others encountering incongruent issue message(s), where the candidate and message recipient do not share the same position. Examining official contact records from the 2012 presidential campaign of Republican Mitt Romney, I find evidence that Romney’s campaign had some success when targeting Democrats with congruent issues. Messaging Democrats with an issue where they and Romney share common ground is associated with decreased support for Obama, increased abstention, and increased support for Romney. Contacting Democrats with an incongruent message and contacting Republicans with either an incongruent or congruent issue message had minimal effects on the voting behavior of the recipient.

Armed with these policy predictions, campaigns can focus their outreach on the particular issue that the data suggest will be most effective at moving each individual to their side by Election Day. Contrary to the narrative often promoted by their data analytics teams and the media (e.g., Brennan, 2012), these estimates are not foolproof. When campaigns narrowcast policy appeals, some people will be targeted with a congruent issue in which their own position aligns with the candidate’s posi- tion. Others will be inadvertently targeted with an incongruent issue in which they and the messaging candidate maintain different positions. Potential gains accrued when the campaign targets individuals with con- gruent issue messages could be offset when they target others with incon- gruent issue messages. In this study, I evaluate turnout and vote choice when campaigns mistakenly target registered voters with an incongruent issue message and when campaigns target registered voters with a congruent mes- sage to see whether, on balance, an issue-based targeting strategy is effec- tive. Using detailed contact records from Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, combined with survey data and validated turnout records for two battleground states, I assess the relationship between narrowly targeted issue messages and voting behavior. Recent research in political science and elsewhere has documented the rise in data analytics (Hersh, 2015; Hillygus & Shields, 2008; Issenberg, 2013) but few have evaluated its use in the context of an actual campaign. Data advancements allow the campaign to focus its outreach on individuals who are believed to share common ground with the candidate based on esti- mates of their issue positions. These predictions should facilitate mobiliza- tion and persuasion by allowing campaigns to emphasize policy agreements to win support from individuals who learn (or are reminded) that they agree with the candidate on an issue (see Hillygus & Shields, 2008). In theory, this should be a successful strategy when campaigns are contacting voters with shared issue messages. However, narrowly targeting policy appeals is poten- tially risky when they include divisive and polarizing topics, commonly referred to as “wedge” issues (Hillygus & Shields, 2008; Wiant, 2002), espe- cially in light of the challenges campaigns face forecasting where individuals positions themselves on policy issues (Endres, 2016).1 When campaigns rely on sometimes faulty policy predictions, some individuals will encounter campaign content highlighting issue(s) in which the recipient and the candi- date share the same position, and they may behave as theorized by voting for the candidate who targeted them. Others will inevitably be the recipients of campaign outreach highlighting an incongruent issue, in which they do not Endres 3 share the messenger’s position, and they could be moved in the opposite direction. The extant research suggests that these are distinct possibilities as partisans who disagree with their party are more likely to defect (Hillygus & Shields, 2008; RePass, 1971). The effects of “wedge” issues may extend beyond candidate preferences. Issue messages that are designed to win someone’s support may have an unintended effect on turnout when individuals recognize that the other party’s candidate is acceptable to the individuals in one or more policy domains. When the prospect of each candidate winning provides some benefit to the individuals, they may become more likely to abstain from voting all together (Downs, 1957) than to cross party lines. Deciding not to vote may be an easier choice than deciding between their competing policy and partisan pre- dispositions. The possibility of heightened abstention is most appropriately investigated in the context of a presidential election as turnout is largely driven by the top of the ticket. However, fully understanding how individuals respond to issue appeals from a presidential campaign is a challenging task that requires knowing both where a voter stands on the issues and which issue content they encounter during the campaign. In this study, I leverage a one-of-a-kind data source—contact records from a presidential campaign combined with pre- and postelection survey data and validated records of turnout—to gauge the implications for participation and vote choice when the campaign targeted partisans with congruent or incon- gruent policy issue messages. As a preview, I find a significant relationship between policy contacts and the voting behavior of Democrats who were targeted on a congruent issue in which they agreed with the Republican presi- dential candidate, Mitt Romney. Democrats who agreed with Romney’s posi- tion on a contacted issue were both more likely to vote for Mitt Romney and to abstain from voting for either major party presidential candidate. The issue contacts seemingly had a parallel, though substantively smaller, effect for Republicans who were targeted on an incongruent issue in which they did not share the Republican presidential candidate’s position. Republicans whose personal position clashed with Romney’s position on the targeted issue appear more likely to abstain from voting for either major party candidate when targeted by the Romney campaign with communications referencing a conflicted policy issue. Background and Expectations The advancements in data analytics, while novel, are used to guide extensive individual-level outreach using traditional modes of communication—phone banking, direct mail, and door-to-door canvassing. Both major parties and 4 American Politics Research 00(0) their presidential campaigns spend a tremendous amount of money to develop and implement their mobilization and persuasion strategies. Millions of con- tacts are made with registered voters in key battleground states during each election using phone banks and direct mail. This individual-level messaging regularly incorporates religious (Albertson, 2011, 2015), racial (Fraga & Leal, 2004; Mendelberg, 2001; Philpot, 2009; Valenzuela & Michelson, 2016), gender-based (Holman, Schneider, & Pondel, 2015; Schaffner, 2005), and policy (Banda, 2013, 2015; Kang, Fowler, Franz, & Ridout, 2014) appeals. When campaigns choose to highlight a policy, they generally prioritize a small set of issues where they enjoy broad support beyond their base (Alvarez, 1998; Petrocik, 1996; Petrocik, Benoit, & Hansen, 2003; Vavreck, 2009). Contacting individuals who share common ground with your candidate has long been considered an essential strategy for winning the backing of indi- viduals who are predisposed to support the other candidate based on their party affiliation. Advancements in data and targeting allow modern cam- paigns to pursue this strategy by narrowcasting messages—especially issue messages—to smaller subsets of registered voters while directing a com- pletely different message to others (Hillygus & Shields, 2008). These mes- sages often reference divisive policy issues, generally referred to as “wedge” issues, that are designed to attract the support of individuals who are predis- posed to vote for the other party and to mobilize their base supporters (Hillygus & Shields, 2008; Wiant, 2002). The success of a campaign’s nar- rowly targeted issue outreach may vary based on the content highlighted in its messaging and the recipient’s underlying predispositions. The use of nar- rowly targeted outreach is potentially a risky strategy when the campaign communicates with the wrong voters (Hersh & Schaffner, 2013) and even when campaigns are successfully targeting out partisans on an issue where their positions may align (Arceneaux & Kolodny, 2009).2 To date, there have been few evaluations of the consequences resulting from the inevitable mismatches between the policy messages directed toward an individual voter and his or her underlying policy positions. This lack of exploration can largely be attributed to the proprietary nature of presidential campaigns and their past reluctance to compile, maintain, and share detailed individual-level contact records with independent researchers. Scholars gener- ally have had to rely on mass appeals, distal measures of a campaign’s ground game, and self-reported contact with political campaigns. Mass appeals trans- mitted by television and radio are the most studied and offer the strongest evidence for partisan persuasion (e.g., see Gerber, Gimpel, Green, & Shaw, 2011; Huber & Arceneaux, 2007; Shaw, 1999). Broad measures of a cam- paign’s ground game—such as the presence of campaign field offices, where Endres 5 volunteers phonebank and coordinate local outreach—similarly suggest a positive relationship between individual-level outreach and a candidate’s vote share (Masket, 2009; Sides & Vavreck, 2013) as well as voter turnout (Weinschenk, 2015). Direct tests of phone calls, mailed outreach, and canvassing have been conducted primarily for downballot races or through partnerships with inter- est groups. These studies offer mixed evidence for defection in response to partisan appeals. The results vary from large persuasive effects (Gerber, Kessler, & Meredith, 2011) to null findings (Cardy, 2005; Nickerson, 2005) or even negative effects when studying persuasive outreach (Bailey, Hopkins, & Rogers, 2016). A recent meta-analysis evaluating the persuasive effects of campaign outreach from experiments conducted in general elections found minimal evidence of campaign persuasion, though the authors concede that issue-based persuasion remains a possibility when campaigns have the resources to identify and target relevant issue cross-pressures (Kalla & Broockman, 2018). Other scholars have reached a similar consensus that persuasion will only occur in a more limited, nuanced, and conditional manner. Specifically, Hillygus and Shields (2008) contend that persuasion is most likely to occur when partisans are targeted on issues in which they agree with the opposing camp. They and others have demonstrated that defection is higher among issue cross-pressured partisans and have documented that campaigns attempt to target this group, but they have not directly linked any changes in voting behavior to campaign targeting due to an absence of measures for the actual issue content that individuals encounter from campaign messages. The analy- ses here are able to directly evaluate the theoretical claim that targeted issue messaging is associated with partisan defection. It further extends the debate by considering the implications of narrowly targeted issue messages not only for vote choice, but also for turnout when the campaign targets individuals with a congruent and/or an incongruent policy message. It is clear that partisans who are cross-pressured on policy issues defect at greater rates than partisans who agree with their party on all issues (Hillygus & Shields, 2008; RePass, 1971), but it is less clear whether that reflects suc- cessful persuasion efforts by the presidential campaigns. Moreover, prior research has not considered the possibility that the effect of such messages might influence turnout. Previous work suggests that partisans who have any predisposition (issue or other) that conflicts with their party participate at rates similar to other partisans (Lavine, Johnston, & Steenbergen, 2012). However, there is reason to believe that individuals whose issue conflicts are activated during the campaign may become less likely to vote altogether if the perceived value of their party’s candidate winning over the other party’s 6 American Politics Research 00(0) candidate declines as they recognize that they agree with the other party’s candidate on one or more issues (Downs, 1957). In fact, some formal models depict abstention as the preferred choice when each candidate is viewed as superior in some respect (Ghirardato & Katz, 2002, 2006). These theoretical considerations generate differential expectations based on each person’s partisanship and their position(s) on the issue(s) they encounter during the campaign. A narrowly targeted issue appeal may increase abstention, may increase support for the messaging candidate, or may increase support for their opponent, depending on the recipient’s under- lying issue position and partisan affiliation relative to the candidate’s issue position and party. To help illustrate my expectations, in the context of the 2012 election, consider the candidates’ tax plans. The 2012 Democratic presi- dential candidate, Barack Obama, proposed raising taxes on high-income earners in the top tax brackets. The Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, opposed these increases and advocated for tax cuts to spur eco- nomic growth. The Romney campaign attempted to persuade Democrats to vote for the Republican candidate by contrasting their tax plans. Persuasion is possible when a Democrat who opposes Obama’s plan to raise taxes on high-income earners (and supports Romney’s position) is contacted on this congruent issue where the Republican presidential candidate and the targeted Democratic voter have overlapping issue positions. Persuasion is not expected when the Romney campaign contacted Democrats who opposed Romney’s plan (and supported Obama’s proposed tax increases on high-income earn- ers). This same tax issue was used by the Romney campaign when messaging Republicans. Backlash, where the Republican votes against Mitt Romney, is possible when this tax message reached incongruent Republicans who sup- port raising taxes on high-income earners (and oppose Romney’s plan). More formally, my three main hypotheses are as follows: The Congruent Issue Hypothesis: Individuals who are targeted with con- gruent policy messages should be more likely to vote for the messaging candidate. In this study, Democrats who are the recipients of campaign messages from the Romney campaign that highlight an issue in which they share the candidate’s position are prime targets for persuasion and should be more likely to vote for Romney when contacted on a relevant issue. Relatedly, Republicans who are targeted with a congruent message will be more likely to vote for Romney. The Incongruent Issue Hypothesis: Individuals who are contacted with an incongruent issue message will be less likely to vote for the messaging candidate. In the context of this study, Democrats who are contacted on an issue in which their position does not align with Romney should not be Endres 7 persuaded and could potentially become more likely to vote for the Democratic presidential candidate. The Romney campaign may experi- ence a decrease in support from Republicans who are mistargeted with an incongruent message, where Romney and the Republican recipient have different issue positions. The Abstention Hypothesis: When partisans recognize that they agree with the other party’s candidate—either because their own party’s candidate contacts them on an incongruent issue or the other party’s candidate tar- gets them on a congruent issue—their likelihood of abstaining will rise. In the context of this 2012 study, this would occur when the Romney cam- paign targeted Republicans with an incongruent issue message or targeted Democrats with a congruent policy issue. Data and Method Through an agreement with the Republican National Committee (RNC), I was provided with official contact records and voter files for Florida and Virginia from the 2012 elections, allowing explicit evaluation of the above expectations. Both states were considered battlegrounds by the Obama and Romney campaigns. The contact records include documentation of outreach attempts by the Romney presidential campaign. The voter files include offi- cial turnout status in the 2012 election as well as the RNC’s turnout propen- sity scores, the RNC’s “swing” (or persuadable) voter predictions, and other background information about each registered voter. The contact records and voter files were provided separately. The voter files contained the full array of identifying information collected by each state and were supplemented with additional information such as phone numbers for many registered vot- ers. The contact records included fewer personal identifying information. The only overlapping information, contained in both provided files, is the 10-digit phone number, which I used to link the contact records and the voter files. To fully understand the interplay between the campaign and registered voters, I combined the files with survey data to obtain information about how registered voters positioned themselves on the issues early in the election cycle and which candidate they supported in the election, if they voted. I was able to link the pre- and postelection surveys from the 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) with the contact records. YouGov con- ducted the CCES (Ansolabehere, 2013; n.d.) and was provided with the voter files to perform the match using the personal identifying information they collect from members of their online survey panel. The process used to link the RNC files to the 2012 CCES is comparable with the process used to match Catalist voter files with the CCES (see Ansolabehere & Hersh, 2012). 8 American Politics Research 00(0) The CCES is a national survey with large samples in many states that are sufficient for investigating the political preferences separately in the more populous states like Florida and Virginia. The CCES consists of both a pre- election instrument, which was fielded during October of 2012, and a post- election instrument, which was conducted immediately following the election. The preelection survey inquired about subjects’ policy positions, whereas the postelection survey collected participants’ vote choice in addi- tion to many other variables that are not used for this analysis. The CCES sample is designed to reflect the U.S. voting age population instead of regis- tered voters. For this reason, many of the CCES respondents are not regis- tered to vote and were not in the voter file. Table 1 displays the CCES sample sizes for Florida and Virginia. The sample is reduced when nonregistered voters are removed and is further reduced to include only individuals who had a phone number listed in the provided voter file. Relying on the phone numbers to connect the voter files and contact records has two analytic consequences. First, the sample is reduced from all matched individuals to the subset of individuals with a phone number listed in the RNC files. While the sample size takes a slight hit, only including individuals with a phone number effectively restricts the sample to the indi- viduals that the campaign could have potentially contacted by phone. Second, some voters share a phone number with other registered voters in their household. In all cases, the analyses are restricted to one- and two- person households. Having household contact information instead of indi- vidual-level communication records is not ideal; however, the campaigns have little control over which member of the household views a mailed post- card or letter and little control over which person hears a phone message, particularly for prerecorded phone calls. Having household contact records instead of individual-level records makes the tests for persuasion and mobi- lization messier. Nonetheless, the data are well suited to determine who the Romney campaign was contacting in these battleground states and how their Table 1. Sample Size by State.

Endres 9 individual-level issue appeals may have affected the voting behavior of Democrats, Republicans, and independents. I proceed by first evaluating which issues the Romney campaign was using in their outreach efforts and whom they were targeting with these issues. After establishing which registered voters the Romney campaign was targeting, I turn my attention to vote choice. I measure vote choice as a cate- gorical variable with voting for Romney, voting for Obama, and not voting for either as the three possible options. I run two sets of multinomial logistic regression models. The primary explanatory variables for the first set of mod- els are indicator variables; the first is for individuals who were contacted on any congruent issue in which they and Romney share the same position (based on self-reports in the preelection survey) on that issue and the second indicator variable for individuals who were “mistakenly” contacted with an incongruent issue message on which they and Romney have different posi- tions. The model for Democrats also includes a variable depicting the number of campaign issues in which the survey respondent reported a position that aligns with Mitt Romney’s stance on the issue, whereas the Republican model includes a related variable counting the number of campaign issues where Republican survey respondents reported a position different than Romney’s on each issue. The second set of models replaces the variables for congruent/ incongruent contact on any issue, with indicator variables for contact on the two most frequently targeted issues: taxes and Obamacare. Indicator vari- ables representing individuals who share Romney’s position on each of these issues are interacted with an indicator variable for contact on each issue. Both sets of models are run separately for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents as the expected behavior varies based on the recipient’s partisan affiliation. All models also include controls for state, gender, race, education, age, estimated propensity to be a “swing” voter, and each regis- tered voter’s estimated propensity to turnout as calculated by the Republican Party as the likelihood of voting factors into their contact decisions (see Endres & Kelly, 2018). The inclusion of the estimated swing and turnout propensity variables help to account for the strategic decision-making that the Romney campaign used when deciding which registered to voters to con- tact and which to ignore.3 Republican Outreach in 2012 The Romney campaign reached out to registered voters in Florida and Virginia by phone and direct mail. Republican presidential campaigns often delegate door-to-door canvassing to the national and state parties (Masket, Sides, & Vavreck, 2016) as Romney did in 2012. The Romney campaign cast 10 American Politics Research 00(0) a wide net in both states by contacting Republicans, Independents, and Democrats. They reached out to 27% of Democrats, 32% of Republicans, and 41% of Independents, in the matched CCES sample, with a policy message.4 Those who were contacted with an issue message were targeted an average of 3 times (M = 3.17, SE = 0.10). Taxes, health care, and national security were the three most frequent issues5 emphasized in the campaign’s individual- level communication with voters regardless of partisanship, as shown in Table 2. This mirrors the issue content of their television advertising (see Fowler & Ridout, 2013; Sides & Vavreck, 2013). In addition to these three issues, the Romney campaign’s phone and direct mail contacts included more limited issue messaging related to energy, gun rights, and welfare reform. The campaign used issue messages to reach out to registered voters whom the data suggested were “swing” voters as well as individuals who were not identified as “swing” voters. They targeted 41% of the individuals who were identified as swing voters, in this sample, with an issue message and 28% who were not identified as swing voters. The campaign contacted similar percentages of high-propensity, middle-propensity, and low-propensity vot- ers within this sample; 29% of low-propensity voters were contacted with an issue message, 32% of midpropensity voters, and 31% of individuals whom they identified as high-propensity voters. Next, I turn my attention to the effects of these issue contacts for vote choice and turnout. Issue Appeals and Voting Behavior The Romney campaign targeted many registered voters with its issue appeals. The question now becomes, “Is there a relationship between the Romney campaign’s individual-level campaign contacts and the voting behavior of Table 2. Percent Contacted by Issue. Democrats (%) Republicans (%) Independents (%) Energy 6 11 6 Health care 55 27 56 Gun rights 6 6 7 National security 44 63 46 Taxes 31 43 47 Welfare 10 12 14 Note. The table displays the percentage contacted with each issue among those who were contacted with an issue message. This information was calculated using the official records from Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign for President for matched individuals with one or two people in the household. Endres 11 partisans who were targeted with congruent or incongruent issue appeals?” To investigate this possibility, I run two sets of multinomial logistic regres- sion models separately for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. The dependent variable for both sets of models is vote choice with three outcome categories: voted for Mitt Romney, voted for Barack Obama, and not voting for either candidate.6 The first set of models includes an indicator variable for individuals who were contacted with any congruent issue message and an indicator variable for individuals who were contacted with any incongruent issue message. The coding of the issue contacts for the indicator variables is restricted to contact on taxes, health care, energy, and gun control. National security and welfare are excluded as the CCES did not include items inquir- ing about self-reported positions and the candidates did not maintain clear contrasting positions on these issues, which is a necessary prerequisite for issue cross-pressures to attract support from the other party’s base (Hillygus & Shields, 2008). A contact is coded as congruent when the recipient’s self- reported position (from the preelection survey) aligns with Romney’s posi- tion on the targeted issue. A contact is coded as incongruent when the recipient’s self-reported position does not align with Romney’s position.7 Survey respondents with a neutral or no position on a contacted issue are coded as incongruent. The second set of models replaces the pooled variable with indicator vari- ables for individuals who agreed with Romney’s position on the two most targeted issues—taxes and health care. Each variable is interacted with an indicator for contact on that issue. Each model also includes controls for gen- der, race, education, and age as prior studies have documented a relationship between these demographic variables and voting behavior. The models also control for state, estimated propensity to turnout as calculated by the RNC, and “persuadability” using the RNC’s “swing” voter predictions to account for the Romney campaign’s contact strategy. Contacting Democrats with a congruent issue message in which the self- identified Democratic recipient agreed with Mitt Romney is associated with significant changes in their voting behavior, as shown in Table 3 and Figure 1. Contact on a congruent issue appears related to both defection to Mitt Romney and abstention among self-identified Democrats, which lends support to both the congruent issue and abstention hypotheses. The congruent issue contacts did not have a significant effect on Republican voting behavior. However, targeting Republicans with an incongruent issue message, in which they did not agree with Romney, appears to be associated with higher rates of abstain- ing from voting for either candidate, though this uptick in abstention is not statistically significant at traditional levels. Neither congruent nor incongruent issue contacts had a significant effect on the voting behavior of Independents. 12 American Politics Research 00(0) To illustrate the substantive impact of the issue contacts for turnout and vote choice, Figure 1 plots the average marginal effects (AME) of congruent and incongruent campaign targeting on the voting behavior for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. As shown in the top half of Figure 1, when the Romney campaign targeted registered voters, who self-identified with the Democratic Party, with a congruent issue message, support for Obama was significantly lower, with an average marginal effect of −0.21 (p = .008, two- tailed). These decreases in Democratic support for Obama were offset by higher rates of abstention and increased support for the Republican presidential Table 3.

When the campaign mistakenly contacted registered voters with an incon- gruent issue message, the mismatched issue contacts did not significantly alter the voting behavior of Democrats, Republicans, or Independents, as shown in the bottom half of Figure 1. However, there is a marginally significant rela- tionship between incongruent contacts and the voting behavior of each group. Incongruent issues contacts generated a small boost in the predicted probabil- ity of Democrats voting for Romney, with an average marginal effect of 0.04 (p = .132, two-tailed). Republicans, on the contrary, who were contacted with an incongruent issue message voted for Romney at lower rates. These incon- gruent issue contacts had an average marginal effect of −0.05 (p = .186, two- tailed) in the predicted probability of self-identified Republicans voting for Romney. While Republicans who were contacted with an incongruent issue message voted for Romney at lower rates, these mismatched contacts are not associated with increased support for Obama. Instead, Republicans who were contacted with an incongruent issue message abstained from voting at higher rates, with an average marginal increase of 0.05 (p = .206, two-tailed) in the predicted probability of abstaining. The substantive effects of the incongruent issue messages, while statistically insignificant at traditional levels, warrant further investigation and raise the possibility of a backlash with in-partisans abstaining at higher rates when they encounter messages from their own party documenting their differences on an important policy issue. Independents, on the contrary, who were contacted with a mismatched issue message voted for Romney at greater rates. The average marginal effect of the issue contact was a 0.10 increase in the predicted probability of voting for Romney (p = .200, two-tailed) and a 0.10 decrease in the predicted probability of voting for Obama (p = .120, two-tailed). This is an unexpected result, which is perhaps an artifact of the coding scheme in which individuals who either did not have a position or reported a neutral position on the issue were coded as an incon- gruent issue contact. Focusing on the modal issue contacts (taxes and health care) similarly demonstrates the effectiveness of the Romney campaign’s issue targeting when contacting Democrats with congruent issue messages and the minimal effects of their outreach to Republicans (Table 4). The second set of models separately interact contact on health care and taxes with an indicator variable for Democrats and Independents who agreed with Romney (disagreed for Republicans) on each issue, based on their self-reported positions in the pre- election survey. Similar to the first set of models, Democrats who were cor- rectly contacted with a congruent message on health care or taxes were significantly less likely to vote for Obama, with an average marginal effect of Endres 15 Table 4.

However, consistent with the first model, abstention was higher for incongruent Obamacare contacts with an average marginal effect of 0.18 (p = .127, two- tailed) and comparable decreases in the predicted probability of voting for Romney (AME = .17, p = .136, two-tailed). The effect of the incongruent tax contacts mirrored the effect of congruent tax contacts with slight increases in support for Romney offset by reductions in abstention among Republican recipients. Discussion The findings presented in this article provide insight on both the communica- tion strategies of modern presidential campaigns and the implications of their targeted issue appeals for both turnout and vote choice. The presidential cam- paign of Republican Mitt Romney cast a wide net with its issue contacts by reaching out to Democrats, Republicans, and independents in the 2012 presi- dential election. The Republican campaign’s narrowly targeted issue appeals sometimes reached registered voters who shared Romney’s position on the targeted issues and at other times did not. The effectiveness of this outreach appears to have varied based on the recipient’s issue positions and their par- tisanship. These targeted issue appeals had their largest impact among self- reported Democrats who agreed with Romney on the targeted policy issue. Exploiting these issue cross-pressures significantly reduced the likelihood of cross-pressured Democrats voting for their party’s presidential candidate, Barack Obama. These targeted contacts increased both abstention and defec- tion to the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, when his campaign contacted cross-pressured Democrats with a congruent issue message. The targeted issue outreach had minimal effects for Republicans overall, though provide some evidence that self-identified Republicans abstained at greater rates if they were mistakenly targeted on an incongruent issue in which they did not share Romney’s position. The persuasive and demobilizing effects of the campaign’s narrowly tar- geted issue contacts appear to be primarily isolated to issue cross-pressured partisans who were targeted on issues in which they disagreed with their own party’s presidential candidate and agreed with the other party’s presidential candidate. In contrast, the campaign contacts had minimal effects when parti- sans were contacted on issues where the message recipient agreed with their own party’s candidate for president on the targeted issue. These findings high- light the importance of considering both the content of campaign messages and the underlying predispositions of voters when evaluating the persuasive Endres 19 and mobilizing effects of electoral campaign communications. Accurately identifying issue cross-pressured partisans and subsequently targeting them with the relevant issue messaging can be an effective strategy to attract some support from partisans affiliated with the opposing political party. Narrowly targeting out-partisans with issue messages appears to be a worthwhile pursuit for campaigns as the correctly targeted issue messages reduced the opposing candidate’s support, whereas the messages emphasiz- ing an incongruent issue had almost no effect on the voting behavior of recipients aligned with the Democratic Party. Contacting in-partisans with an issue message, on the contrary, is risky, with little gains even when the campaign identifies (and contacts) policy supporters. When partisans learn (or are reminded) that they share policy ground with the other party’s presi- dential candidate, both abstention and crossing party lines to vote for the other party’s presidential candidate are distinct possibilities following tar- geted policy messages. The demobilizing effects of narrowly targeted issue appeals, when the Republican campaign contacted Democrats with a con- gruent issue message and (to a lesser extent) targeted Republicans with an incongruent issue message, have largely been unexplored in prior research, but align with theoretical expectations (see Downs, 1957; Ghirardato & Katz, 2002, 2006) and also coincide with recent experiments that evaluate the effects of nonpartisan policy information on the voting behavior of cross-pressured partisans (Endres & Panagopoulos, 2019). Nevertheless, these findings warrant further investigation as studies relying on observa- tional data may produce biased estimates as they are unable to account for all differences between individuals who were and were not contacted by the campaign (Arceneaux, Gerber, & Green, 2006, 2010; Gerber, Green, & Kaplan, 2014). Future research should continue to investigate the effects of narrowly targeted issue appeals. It is imperative that we develop a greater understanding of how changes in campaign technology and outreach influ- ence the attitudes and participation of Americans, especially in light of the continued investment in data analytics by both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.

Notes 1. Endres calculated that the Republican’s 2012 policy estimates were wrong between 18% and 55% of the time depending on the issue and state. 2. In addition to the possibility of targeting registered voters who may not agree with the candidate’s issue position, the use of narrowly targeted messaging can be risky if recipients recognize that the campaign is using tailored messages based on data that it has purchased or otherwise obtained without the recipient’s consent. In a 2012 survey, large majorities reported that they would be less likely to support a candidate using this type of tailored messaging (Turow, Carpini, Draper, & Howard-Williams, 2012). 3. See the Supplemental Appendix for coding and question wording of all variables. 4. About 88% of these individuals self-reported being contacted by “a candidate or political campaign organization” during the postelection survey. Unfortunately, the survey did not inquire which candidate or political organization contacted them or which issues were referenced in the communication. 5. I took a conservative approach to coding the issues referenced in the contacts. For example, some contacts records were documented as outreach toward women, Hispanics, social conservatives, or veterans, but did not mention a specific policy issue that may have been highlighted in the mailer or phone call. I coded each of these as unknown issue content instead of assuming that outreach geared toward one of these groups emphasized an issue that is often associated with that group. 6. This includes a small number of individuals who reported voting for a third-party presidential candidate. 7. All of the energy and gun control outreach occurred after the preelection survey closed. Some of the health care and taxation contact overlapped with the preelec- tion data collection. Thus, it is possible that some self-reported issues positions were influenced by the campaign outreach on these issues. References Albertson, B. L. (2011). Religious appeals and implicit attitudes.
