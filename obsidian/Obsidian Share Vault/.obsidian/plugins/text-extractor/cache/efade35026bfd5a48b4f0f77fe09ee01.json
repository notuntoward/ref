The key identiﬁcation assumption of the RD design is the continuity of other pre-treatment covariates; so long as treatment status is the only vari- able that changes discontinuously at the cutoﬀ, the causal eﬀect of treatment is identiﬁable at that point (Hahn, Todd and Van Der Klaauw, 2001). Because such thresholds, cutoﬀs, and boundaries are a common feature of political institutions, RD has proven a popular research design in political science over the past two decades (de la Cuesta and Imai, 2016). Estimating the average treatment eﬀect at the cutoﬀ requires ﬁnding the limits of the outcome variable as it approaches from the left and right. Traditionally, researchers have estimated these limits in one of two ways. The ﬁrst approach is to ﬁt a high-order poly- nomial regression on either side of the cutoﬀ, then take the diﬀerence between the two regressions’ predictions at the cutoﬀ. This approach suﬀers from a disadvantage common to any parametric estimation strategy: if the true data generating process is not captured by the researcher’s model speciﬁcation, then any causal eﬀect estimate is likely to be biased. Gelman and Imbens (2019) catalogue three other disadvantages of this approach: global methods tend to overﬁt to observations far away from the cutoﬀ, estimates are sensitive to the researcher’s choice of polynomial degree, and conﬁdence intervals have poor coverage. In response to these problems, Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014), hereafter CCT, developed a local linear regression approach to RD estimation that keeps observations within a bandwidth (h) that minimizes the mean squared error of the RD estimator. Their approach estimates the limits approaching the cutoﬀ using local linear regression weighted by a trian- gular kernel and adjusting for a bias-correction term, and the authors derive robust standard errors for inference. Conﬁdence intervals from this method produce the best empirical cov- erage of any method proposed to date, and its estimates perform well in a wide array of simulations. 2 Because the CCT estimator relies on a smaller number of observations close to the cutoﬀ, it reduces bias at the expense of higher variance. As a result, datasets that are sparse or noisy in the neighborhood of the cutoﬀ can yield estimates that overﬁt to chance patterns near the cutoﬀ. As the ongoing replication crisis in experimental sciences has demonstrated, such low-powered studies are pernicious when combined with a publication bias towards statistically signiﬁcant results (Button et al., 2013). The estimated treatment eﬀects from published low-powered studies tend to signiﬁcantly overestimate the true treatment eﬀect, a distortion that Gelman and Carlin (2014) refer to as Type M errors. To illustrate this problem in the RD case, consider the simulated data in Figure 1, distributed X ∼ U (−1, 1), Y ∼ N (0, σ) + 1(X > 0)τ , and τ = 0. Figure 1: Simulated false positive RD estimates from local polynomial approaches. Dashed vertical lines are the CCT MSE-optimal bandwidth. Solid vertical line is the cutoﬀ. Gray points are the raw data, and black lines are the local polynomial ﬁts. Left two ﬁgures generated with parameters τ = 0, σ = 1 2, n = 500. Right two ﬁgures generated with parameters τ = 0, σ = 1, n = 1000. 3 Although there is no simulated discontinuity at the cutoﬀ, local polynomial estimators produce large and statistically signiﬁcant estimates of ˆτ . When τ = 0, CCT 95% conﬁdence intervals reject the null hypothesis (H0 : τ = 0) roughly 7% of the time. Of these rejections, over 90% display a characteristic “zig zag” pattern illustrated in the ﬁgure – steep-sloped regression functions on either side of the cutoﬀ and a treatment eﬀect of the opposite sign.1 This pattern is emblematic of false positive or exaggerated claims from noisy RD data, and will be present in many of the empirical applications we present below. When faced with an overﬁtting problem, the principled remedy is regularization, penal- izing extreme estimates to guard against overﬁtting to noisy data. In this paper we suggest a Bayesian approach to regularized RD estimation ﬁrst proposed by Branson et al. (2019), which we call Gaussian Process Regression Discontinuity (GPRD). Because it places a prior on the smoothness of the conditional expectation function, this method is particularly useful for moderating the exaggerated claims from low-powered RD studies. In the following two sections, we introduce GPRD and show that it performs well in simulations, overcoming the disadvantages of traditional global polynomial approaches while producing lower variance estimates than local linear approaches. In section 4 we apply GPRD to a large set of pub- lished RD studies where low power has yielded exaggerated treatment eﬀects. We conclude with an agenda for future research, and provide open source software for researchers (the R package gprd). 2 Gaussian Process Regression for RD Designs In regression discontinuity (RD) designs, we attempt to estimate the causal eﬀect of a treat- ment that is assigned at a speciﬁc value of some running variable, x. We assume the outcomes y are a noisy function of the running variable x, and we are interested in the discontinuity in 1Or, when estimated using a local quadratic regression, a concave regression function on one side of the cutoﬀ, and a convex function on the other side. 4 f (x) induced by the treatment. We propose using Gaussian process regression (Neal, 1998) to learn this conditional expectation function f (x) and estimate causal eﬀects in RD designs. To formalize the RD problem we start by assuming the outcomes are normally distributed, y ∼ N ( f (x) , σ2 yI) , (1) where f (x) is an unknown function of the running variable x. A treatment occurs at a cutoﬀ value c of x; that is, all outcomes where x ≥ c receive the treatment. For simplicity here we will assume c = 0. Alternatively, we might assume that the outcomes are normally distributed but with diﬀerent mappings between input and output on either side of the cutoﬀ; y+ ∼ N ( f+ (x+) , σ2 yI) , (2) y− ∼ N ( f− (x−) , σ2 yI) , (3) We will propose two diﬀerent methods to estimate the treatment eﬀect τ of the inter- vention using Gaussian process (GP) regression. The ﬁrst, which we call the global GPRD estimator, ﬁts a single GP model for all observations, with a dummy variable D to indicate treatment, and estimates the treatment eﬀect using the diﬀerence in prediction when x = c and D = 1 and D = 0. The second, which we call the piecewise GPRD estimator, models the data separately on either side of the cutoﬀ and estimates the treatment eﬀect using the diﬀerence between predictions at the cutoﬀ from the “right equation” and “left equation.” 2.1 Gaussian Process Regression GP regression is a method used to learn the mapping from x to y when its functional form is not known, accomplished by placing a GP prior over the function space. As this methodology 5 is uncommon in the political science literature, we provide a brief overview here. A Gaussian process (GP) is an inﬁnite dimensional generalization of the normal distri- bution. More speciﬁcally, it is “collection of random variables, any ﬁnite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution” (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006, 13). The mean and covariance of this normal distribution is given as functions of the inputs, so that we say f (x) ∼ GP(m(x), K(x)). (4) Common examples for the mean function are the “mean zero” function m(x) = 0 and the “linear mean” function m(x) = xβ. A common example of a covariance function (also called a kernel) is the isometric squared exponential covariance function, aka the radial basis function, K (x, x ′) = σ2 f exp ( −0.5 (x − x′)2 ℓ2 ) , (5) where σf is a hyperparameter called the scale factor, which scales the entire covariance matrix, and ℓ is a hyperparameter called the length scale, which inﬂuences how quickly f varies in x. Then the i, j element of the covariance matrix is given by K(xi, xj). This setup allows us to model distributions over functions rather than simply distribu- tions over variables. Then, rather than assume we know the form of the mapping between the input variables X and outcomes y—such as a polynomial of a particular order—we can instead use a GP to place a probability distribution over all possible mappings from X to y. With a Gaussian likelihood for the data given X and f (x), a posterior distribution over f (x) is then given by application of Bayes’ rule utilizing Gaussian identities. 2 Crucially for our purposes, well known results provide the posterior predictive distribution for a test 2For a more detailed derivation of this posterior distribution, see Rasmussen and Williams (2006), Chapter 2. 6 observation x∗ as f (x∗) ∼ N (m∗, C ∗) (6) m ∗ = m(x∗) + K(x∗, x)[K(x) + σ2 yI]−1(y − m(x)) (7) C ∗ = K(x∗) − K(x∗, x)[K(x) + σ2 yI] −1K(x, x ∗). (8) Note that Bayesian linear regression is a special case of Gaussian process regression, using the linear covariance function K(x, x ′) = x · x′.3 When using other kernels, we simply allow non-linearity in the mapping from input to response. In other words, GP regression is a ﬂexible extension to Bayesian linear regression to account for uncertainty in the functional form mapping predictors to response by assuming the covariance between outcomes is a function of the predictor variables. In the case of the common squared exponential covariance function (and its extension discussed in Section 2.2, the automatic relevance determination kernel), we assume that covariance between outcomes is a function of distance in the covariate space. 2.2 The Global GPRD Estimator For the global GPRD estimator, we place a Gaussian process (GP) prior on f (x), p(f ) = GP(Xβ, K(X)), (9) where K is the squared exponential automatic relevance determination covariance func- tion K (X, X ′) = σ2 f exp ( −0.5 ∑ j ( X·,j − X ′ ·,j)2 ℓ 2 j ) (10) with hyperparameters σf , the scale factor as in the squared exponential covariance func- 3A constant hyperparameter is added to K if an intercept is desired. 7 tion from Equation 5, and ℓ is a length scale vector with a separate length scale for each predictor variable, and where X = [ 1|x|D ] , with D =    1 if x ≥ c, 0 otherwise. (11) Note that there is never a diﬀerence between observations on the value of the intercept column, so the X that goes into the mean function Xβ will include that column, but the X going into the covariance function does not (and accordingly ℓ is of length two, not three); we suppress this diﬀerence in the notation for simplicity. We use a Gaussian prior for β, with mean b and covariance B. Then the posterior over β is given by β | y, X ∼ N ( ¯β, Σβ) , (12) ¯β = Σβ ( X T K −1 y y + B−1b) , (13) Σβ = (B−1 + X T K −1 y X)−1 , (14) Ky = K(X) + σ2 yI (15) (see Rasmussen and Williams (2006), section 2.7). Note that for the common case where b = 0, ¯β simpliﬁes to Σβ(X T K −1 y y). 8 Then the mean and variance of f at a test point X∗ is ¯f (X∗) = X∗ ¯β + K∗K −1 y (y − X ¯β), (16) cov(f∗) = K∗∗ − K∗K −1 y K T ∗ + RT (X T K −1 y X) −1R, (17) K∗ = K(X∗, X), (18) K∗∗ = K(X∗), (19) R = X T ∗ − X T K −1 y K T ∗ (20) (See Equations 2.24, 2.38, and 2.41 in Rasmussen and Williams 2006). These diﬀer from Equations 7 and 8 because we have incorporated uncertainty in the mean function parameters. 4 So we are interested in the treatment eﬀect τGP RD−G def = f ([ 0 1 ]) − f ([ 0 0 ]) , (21) or the diﬀerence between f (x = 0, D = 1) and f (x = 0, D = 0), which is distributed τGP RD−G ∼ N (µ∗, Σ∗) , (22) µ∗ = ¯f ([ 0 1 ]) − ¯f ([ 0 0 ]) , (23) Σ∗ = cov ( f ([ 0 1 ])) + cov ( f ([ 0 0 ])) . (24) Note the key diﬀerences between the global GPRD estimator and the global polynomial RD estimator. In the global polynomial model, the treatment eﬀect is taken to be the coef- ﬁcient on D, which gives the diﬀerence in expected outcomes for the treated and untreated 4One could instead select mean function coeﬃcients by maximizing the marginal log likelihood as we discuss for the covariance function hyperparameters in Section 2.4, in which case ¯f (X∗) and cov(f∗) would again be given by Equations 7 and 8. 9 observations at any point x. In the GP model, this is not true; the coeﬃcient on D impacts the expected outcome, but the eﬀect of the treatment also runs through the kernel (see Equation 16). 2.3 The Piecewise GPRD Estimator Non-parametric regression discontinuity designs ﬁt polynomials on either side of the discon- tinuity, and estimate the treatment eﬀect as the diﬀerence of the limit of the polynomials at the cutoﬀ. The piecewise GP estimation strategy extends this approach by placing Gaussian process (GP) priors over the functions on either side of the cutoﬀ, which will be much more ﬂexible than the polynomial regression approach and less sensitive to overﬁtting predictions close to the cutoﬀ to observations far away from the cutoﬀ. By design, the ﬁt near the cutoﬀ will rely more on inputs close to the cutoﬀ than those far away. To formalize, x+ will be the inputs to the right of the cutoﬀ and y+ the corresponding outcomes, and analogously for x− and y−. Then we will learn two functions, f+ : x+ → y+ and f− : x− → y−. To do so, we place GP priors over the functions, f+ ∼ GP(X+β+, K(x+)), (25) f− ∼ GP(X−β−, K(x−)), (26) where X· prepends the column vector 1 to x·, β· is a vector giving the intercept and slope of the linear mean function, and K(·) is the isometric squared exponential covariance function from Equation 5. We again use a Gaussian prior for β, with mean b and covariance B, and the mean and variance of f· at a test point x∗ is as given in Equations 16 and 17. Then we are interested in the treatment eﬀect τGP RD−P def = f+(0) − f−(0), (27) 10 which is distributed τGP RD−P ∼ N ( ¯f+(0) − ¯f−(0), cov(f+(0)) + cov(f−(0))). (28) Note the key diﬀerences between the piecewise GPRD estimator and local linear or poly- nomial RD estimators. The local polynomial estimators use only a portion of the data to either side of the cutoﬀ to avoid undue inﬂuence of observations far from the cutoﬀ. In contrast, the GP model is able to use all of the available data because the covariance be- tween outputs decreases with distance in the covariate space, a natural and smooth way to decrease undue inﬂuence of observations far from the cutoﬀ while still borrowing some information from them. Additionally, the local methods require speciﬁcation of the degree of the local polynomials, and this researcher-imposed model restriction can signiﬁcantly impact inference. By contrast, in the GP model, we place a prior over the possible mappings from x to y and learn f (x) from the data. Also note the diﬀerences between the piecewise GPRD estimator we introduce and the approach taken in Branson et al. (2019). While Branson et al. largely rely on a shared covariance assumption, we relax this assumption, selecting diﬀerent covariance function hy- perparameters for the treatment and control groups. When the covariance function hyper- parameters in fact should be shared, parameter selection or sampling routines should be able to recover that. When they are not, and the mapping from runnning variable to outcomes is wholly diﬀerent between the treatment and control groups, the piecewise GPRD estimator we introduce may be most appropriate. Taken together, our global and piecewise GPRD estimators can be seen as capturing a fairly wide range of restrictiveness of prior assumptions in GP regression estimation of treatment eﬀects in RD designs. It is also useful to acknowledge one important assumption shared by our approaches, that of stationarity, or that covariance hyperparameters do not themselves also vary as a function of the running variable. We leave the relaxation of that 11 assumption to future work. 2.4 Choosing Hyperparameters Because our inferences are strongly aﬀected by the choice of hyperparameters σy, σf , and ℓ, we need a theoretically-grounded, automatic procedure for selecting their values. Our preferred approach is to place priors over the covariance function hyperparameters, propa- gating uncertainty over their values into the posterior distribution of the treatment eﬀect. Note that in this case, however, we cannot use exact inference but must instead resort to simulating the posterior with an MCMC sampler. In the empirical applications below, we take this approach using the following prior distributions: ℓ ∼ InvGamma(5, 5) (29) σf ∼ HalfNormal(0, 1) (30) σy ∼ HalfNormal(0, 1) (31) The inverse gamma prior on the length scale is a boundary-avoiding prior (Gelman, 2014, 313) which penalizes inﬁnitesimal values, and the half-normal prior on σf ensures that some prior weight is placed on the zero function. These priors are most sensible for x and y variables that have been standardized so that their variance equals 1. A practical impediment to the fully Bayesian approach is computation time, which scales super-linearly with n. As of writing, ﬁtting a Gaussian process regression with 1,000 ob- servations by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo takes roughly half an hour. Though this is not too time-consuming for applied work, it is prohibitive for simulations. So in the following section, we speed up computation by plugging in hyperparameters that maximize the log marginal 12 likelihood. In the case of a linear mean, the log marginal likelihood is log p(y | X, b, B) = −1 2M T Q−1M − 1 2 log |Q| − n 2 log 2π, (32) M = Xb − y, (33) Q = Ky + XBX T , (34) (see Equation 2.43 in Rasmussen and Williams 2006). Again, note that for the common case b = 0, M reduces to −y. Then the gradient of the log marginal likelihood with respect to the hyperparameters θ = (σy, σf , ℓ) in the case of the isometric covariance function is ∂ ∂θi log p(y | X, b, B) = 1 2M Q−1 ∂Q ∂θi Q −1M − 1 2 Tr ( Q −1 ∂Q ∂θi ) , (35) ∂Q ∂θ =       2σyI 2σf exp (−0.5K0) σ2 f exp (−0.5K0) ◦ K0       , (36) where the i, j element of the matrix K0 is given by K0 i,j = (xi − xj) 2 ℓ2 , (37) and we can use (e.g.) the conjugate gradient method to optimize the hyperparameters. The gradient for the automatic relevance determination case is analogous, but just extended with an element for each element of ℓ accordingly. 13 3 Comparing Models: Simulation Evidence To assess performance of the GPRD estimators compared to existing methods, we engage in two simulation exercises. First, we use a common set of simulations from the RD literature, where the running variable x is given by 2z − 1, with z ∼ B(2, 4), and y = fj(x) + ε, with ε ∼ N (0, 0.1295 2). To specify the shape function fj(x), we use the three functions explored in Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014), themselves taken from Lee (2008) and Ludwig and Miller (2007). We additionally use global linear and quadratic functions, f (x) = x + τ I(x > 0) and f (x) = x2 + τ I(x > 0), with τ = 0 and τ = 1, for a total of seven tested data generating processes. For each DGP, we simulate 1,000 datasets of 500 observations. We estimate treatment eﬀects and conﬁdence intervals for global GPRD, piecewise GPRD, local linear, and ﬁfth-degree global polynomial approaches (the Lee and Ludwig and Miller DGPs both use ﬁve-degree polynomials). Figure 2 depicts the root mean squared error, mean absolute error, conﬁdence interval length, and conﬁdence interval coverage averaged by simulation condition. The GPRD methods generally outperform other methods in terms of error and conﬁdence interval length; when averaged across conditions, the GPRD methods outperform all other methods on these metrics, and for some DGPs, this diﬀerence is more pronounced. In the Lee and Ludwig-Miller simulations, the GPRD estimates are biased; this echoes ﬁndings in Branson et al. (2019), who note that with these DGPs, the functions’ slope increases markedly near the cutoﬀ, violating the stationarity assumption we leverage. As with any regularizing estimate, one can think of our method as deliberately introducing a bias in small samples to reduce variance and overﬁtting. As sample size increases, this bias shrinks. The results averaged across all conditions for all data generating processes, as well as only stationary data generating processes, are given in Table 1. In the absence of a violation of the stationarity assumption, the GPRD methods increases precision while retaining coverage. Importantly, note that these simulations, standard in 14 ●● ●● ●● ●● ●● ●● ●● Linear (τ = 0) Linear (τ = 1) Quadratic (τ = 0) Quadratic (τ = 1) Lee (τ = 0.04) Lee Mod.

First, they are all published in top political science and economics journals over the past ﬁve years. Second, they all adhere to current best practices for RD studies, employing local polynomial es- timators with automated bandwidth selectors and robust standard errors, and conducting extensive falsiﬁcation and robustness tests. Third, the authors provide suﬃcient replication materials to reproduce their work. In short, we select these studies not because they are poor examples of applied RD, but because they are good examples of careful and rigorous em- pirical work. Nevertheless, many of these studies employ datasets that are too low-powered 17 near the cutoﬀ to reliably detect plausible treatment eﬀects. In total, we replicate 29 studies published since 2015 that employ a regression discontinu- ity design. We re-estimate the treatment eﬀects using both CCT local linear regression and piecewise GPRD. These estimates are summarized in Figure 4, standardized so as to appear on the same scale. For studies with a large number of observations near the cutoﬀ, the estimates from the two methods do not diﬀer signiﬁcantly. But for studies with low power near the cutoﬀ, the two estimates often diﬀer noticeably. Typically, the GPRD estimate is closer to zero than the CCT estimate, but not universally – see, for example, the replications of Carson and Sievert (2017) and Horowitz et al. (2019). The reader may ﬁnd descriptions of each replication in the appendix, and below we discuss three in detail. 4.1 The Radical Right and Party Manifestos Abou-Chadi and Krause (2018) study how the presence of radical right parties inﬂuence the platforms of mainstream parties. Their causal identiﬁcation strategy is based on electoral thresholds in parliamentary systems; typically it is required that a party clear some per- centage of the total vote before gaining representation in parliament, where the particular threshold varies by country. The authors compare elections where radical right parties barely exceeded the threshold (gaining representation) and barely missed the threshold, observing how mainstream political parties respond. The dependent variable is change in a measure of Cultural Protection in the party’s manifesto during the following election. These data are compiled by the Comparative Man- ifestos Project (Volkens, Pola Lehmann and Werner, 2015), and the outcome variable is a function of the diﬀerence between the number of favorable mentions of cultural diversity and encouragement of integration and cultural homogeneity in the party’s platform (Lowe et al., 2011). In their paper, Abou-Chadi and Krause (2018) present estimates from a diverse range of speciﬁcations, which range from 3.1 to 4.9. Replicating these results using CCT 18 Figure 4: Estimates and 95% conﬁdence intervals across 30 replications, sorted by sample size within the CCT bandwidth. Estimates are standardized in order to plot them on the same scale. 19 bias-corrected standard errors and robust conﬁdence intervals yields an estimate of 3.96, with 95% conﬁdence interval [1.7, 6.2]. To get a sense of the relative magnitude of this estimated eﬀect, consider Figure 5. This plots the average value of the Cultural Protection score, by country, for each family of political party since 1980. Although the Cultural Protection score is noisy from election year to election year, averaging across years yields predictable patterns. Right-leaning parties tend to score higher on the measure than left-leaning parties, and Nationalist parties – where they exist – typically score 2 to 3 points higher than the average mainstream party. Figure 5: Mean Cultural Protection score by country and party family (all elections post- 1980; Center-Left includes Social Democrats and Liberals, Center-Right includes Christian Democrats and Conservatives). In this context, an estimated eﬀect size of 3.9 is enormous. If true, it suggests that not only do mainstream parties respond to Radical Right representation by moving their plat- 20 forms to the right, but they do so in such a way that their rhetoric completely closes or even overtakes the average gap between mainstream and rightwing nationalist party positions. By comparison, GPRD yields a more modest treatment eﬀect estimate, with a 95% pos- terior interval that covers zero. Table 3 compares the eﬀect sizes estimated by the piecewise GPRD and CCT estimators, and Figure 6 visualizes those estimates. We can see that the local linear estimator yields a steep prediction line just to the left of the cutoﬀ, within a bandwidth that contains only 24 observations. Because the GPRD estimator makes use of observations outside that bandwidth, it yields a mean function that is less overﬁt to obser- vations near the cutoﬀ. The estimated treatment eﬀect is roughly 0.33 standard deviations, or 0.5 units on the cultural protectionism scale, a more a priori plausible eﬀect size.

There is a large literature on this topic, dating back to Alesina, Baqir and Easterly (1999) and continuing through Hopkins (2011) and Trounstine (2015), ﬁnding that in ethnically diverse and segregated cities, municipal governments devote less spending to public goods than in ethnically homogeneous cities. All of these studies rely on cross-sectional or longitudinal regression analysis of public ﬁnance data, and so lack a credible causal identiﬁcation. Beach and Jones (2017) approach the problem through an RD analysis of city council elections in California. Because narrowly elected city councilors from a ‘non-modal’ ethnicity should increase the diversity of a city council, the discontinuity at the plurality margin allows for the causal identiﬁcation of an eﬀect of council diversity on public spending. By regressing per capita public goods spending on the vote margin of ‘non-modal’ can- didates for races where a non-modal candidate faced a modal candidate, Beach and Jones (2017) estimate a treatment eﬀect of -0.31 on a log scale, implying that the election of a single councilmember that increases ethnic diversity causes a 31% drop in public goods spending. To consider this estimate in context, a 31% cut in public goods spending amounts to roughly $ 463 per capita for the average city. This is equivalent to eliminating all spending on police (13% in the average city), ﬁre protection (9%), and roads (9%). By comparison, other studies of municipal spending suggest much more modest (or null) eﬀects. For example, in an RD analyis of Democratic vs. Republican mayoral candidates, de Benedictis-Kessner 22 and Warshaw (2016) ﬁnd that narrowly-elected Democratic mayors increase public spending by 5% on average. In their original study of US cities, Alesina, Baqir and Easterly (1999) ﬁnd that ethnically diverse cities spend 6% to 9% lower shares on “productive” public goods than ethnically homogeneous cities.5 All of these estimates are several multiples smaller than 30%. Even assuming that the eﬀect of a non-modal city councilmember is comparable to that of a Democratic mayor, 6 the RD analysis would be too underpowered to reliably detect a more plausible eﬀect. The minimum detectable eﬀect size given the number of observations in this study is roughly 32% (Bloom, 1995) 7, and the RD plots in Figure 7 makes this problem clear: although a substantial fraction of the sample lies within the bandwidth, the variation in public goods spending is very large relative to any plausible eﬀect size. A suﬃciently high powered study to detect an eﬀect size of 5% would require many times more observations within the neighborhood of the cutoﬀ. Table 4 and Figure 7 compare the GPRD and local linear RD estimates. The GPRD estimate is four times smaller than the local linear estimate, and not reliably diﬀerent than zero. Table 4: Treatment eﬀect comparison between GPRD and local linear regression for the Beach and Jones (2017) application. Estimator Treatment eﬀect 95% CI Local Linear −0.618 [−1.07, −0.167] Piecewise GPRD −0.165 [−0.519, 0.113] 5This is the estimated eﬀect of changing the Herﬁndahl ethnic fractionalization index from 0 to 1 (i.e. from perfect homogeneity to perfect heterogeneity). 6Not an unreasonable assumption, since in many municipalities the mayor does not wield strong executive power, and is essentially the chair of the city council. 7See Cattaneo, Titiunik and Vazquez-Bare (2019) for derivation of power calculations in the RD context 23 Figure 7: Fit comparison between GPRD (black with shaded 95% posterior interval) and CCT (blue) estimators for the Beach and Jones (2017) application. All variables standardized with x centered around the RD cutoﬀ and y centered around its mean. 4.3 Political Connections and Firm Proﬁtability in Russia Szakonyi (2018) investigates close elections to regional legislatures in Russia, testing whether ﬁrms with regional political connections subsequently see higher proﬁt margins. The local linear RD estimate is strongly positive, suggesting that the election a board member causes as much as a 15% increase in ﬁrm proﬁts. This is lucrative eﬀect! As the author notes, “The presence of a political connection can spell the diﬀerence between an impressively proﬁtable ﬁrm and one that barely breaks into the black.” By comparison, the GPRD treatment eﬀect estimate is approximately zero. Eyeballing Figure 8, it is clear that, unlike the previous two examples, there are plenty of observations within the CCT bandwidth. But, like the examples from Figure 1 a chance pattern in observations near the cutoﬀ yields steep-sloped prediction lines that appear to exaggerate 24 the discontinuity. Figure 8: Fit comparison between GPRD (black with shaded 95% posterior interval) and CCT (blue) estimators for the Szakonyi (2018) application. All variables standardized with x centered around the RD cutoﬀ and y centered around its mean. Table 5: Treatment eﬀect comparison between GPRD and local linear regression for the Szakonyi (2018) application. Estimator Estimate 95% CI CCT 0.46 [0.105, 0.816] GPRD 0.05 [-0.146, 0.306] 5 Conclusion In this paper, we have demonstrated how low-powered regression discontinuity analyses can yield misleading and exaggerated causal eﬀect estimates, characterized by an implausibly large divergence in the slope of the conditional expectation function in the neighborhood of 25 the cutoﬀ. We propose Gaussian Process Regression Discontinuity (GPRD) as a principled method to address these problems. GPRD performs well in simulations and provides more plausible treatment eﬀect estimates in empirical applications. In future work we plan to expand GPRD to handle fuzzy RD designs, clustered data, and the inclusion of additional pre-treatment covariates. All of these will be made available for researchers in the forthcoming R package gprd.

We are able to replicate twenty-eight of the studies listed in Table 6 using both local linear and Gaussian Process RD. The appendices that follow contain details about each study’s design and the estimated treatment eﬀect using both methods. Throughout, we report standardized eﬀect sizes, centering the running variable on the RD cutoﬀ and the outcome variable on its mean. In the ﬁgures, the local linear ﬁt is plotted in blue and the GPRD ﬁt and 95% posterior interval is plotted in black. Raw data are semi-transparent circles, though for some visualizations it is clearer to present the averages by bins instead of the raw data. These binned data are represented as squares. The GPRD posterior is sampled via Hamilton Monte Carlo (rstan), and to speed computation we keep at most 1,000 observations closest to the cutoﬀ. 29 author year journal outcome treatment score 1 Grumbach & Sahn (2020) APSR Minority Campaign Contributions Minority Candidate Primary Vote Share 2 Thompson (2020) APSR Sheriﬀ Compliance with Federal Immigration Requests Sheriﬀ Partisanship Vote Share 3 Dynes & Holbein (2020) APSR Policy Outcomes US State Party Control Vote Share 4 Cavaille & Marshall (2019) APSR Anti-Immigrant Attitudes Extra Year of Schooling Birth Cohort 5 Mo & Conn (2018) APSR Beliefs About Disadvantage National Service (TFA) TFA Selection Criteria 6 Broockman & Skovron (2018) APSR Contacts from Republicans Republican Politician Vote Share 7 Hall & Thompson (2018) APSR In-Party Turnout Extremist Nominee Primary Vote Share 8 Dahlgaard (2018) APSR Turnout Child Eligibility Child’s Age 9 Fiva & Smith (2018) APSR Dynasty Formation Incumbency Vote Share 10 Szakonyi (2018) APSR Firm Proﬁts Connected Politician Vote Share 11 Nellis & Siddiqui (2018) APSR Religious Violence Secular Party Rule Vote Share 12 Hyytinen et al.
