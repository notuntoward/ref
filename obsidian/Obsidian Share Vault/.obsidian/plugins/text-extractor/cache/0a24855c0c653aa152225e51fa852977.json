Kirby 4 Maintaining system frequency is one of the fundamental drivers of power system reliability Frequency Integrating Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) Increases Variability and Uncertainty All power systems (regardless of VRE penetration) – Variability: Load varies throughout the day, conventional generation can often deviate from schedules – Uncertainty: Contingencies are unexpected, load forecast errors are unexpected Wind and solar generation – Variability: Wind and solar generator outputs vary on different time scales based on the intensity of their energy sources (wind and sun) – Uncertainty: Wind and solar generation cannot be predicted with perfect accuracy 27 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. in total power output compared to the clear sky conditions, as well as a decrease in the rapid changes in power output due to the geographic diversity of the baseline scenario. Figure 19. Clear sky and synthetic PV power output, one-minute resolution, for (left) single, randomly selected site from the baseline PV scenario, and (right) aggregation of all of the baseline PV sites on July 23, 2006, and Oct. 12, 2006 In October, the aggregate time series power nearly matches the clear sky power output in all of the baseline scenarios. Single locations can have significant midday variability (Figure 19b); however, the variability of a 5-MWDC PV plant has little effect on the aggregate performance of 1,905 MWDC plants spread over a 72,000 km2 area. The aggregate power output from the baseline scenario, each expansion scenario (separate from the baseline), and the baseline scenario plus each of the expansion scenarios are shown in Figure 20 for both July 23, 2006 (monsoon season), and Oct. 12, 2006 (dry season). Figure 20 (top left) demonstrates that during the monsoon season the largest variability in solar power output among the expansion scenarios is from the Charanka scenario, in which PV is concentrated at a single location. Three expansion scenarios (rooftop PV in 16 cities, seven utility PV locations, and Kutchh region), when combined with the baseline scenario, all show a decrease in the relative magnitude of unpredicted ramps on July 23 due to an increase in the total geographic diversity (the aggregate magnitudes are of course most important to grid systems operation). During the dry season, geographic diversity is not as important because there are “clear skies” over nearly all of Gujarat. 5 Output from a 5MW fixed panel in Gujarat, India Source: Hummon et al.

In this webinar, we use the term forecasting primarily to refer to the near- term (usually up to day-ahead) prediction of electricity generation from wind and solar power plants. Source: Electricity Reliability Council of Texas short-term wind power forecast Load forecasting refers to the prediction of electricity demand. 10 Day-ahead wind power forecast Most recent short- term wind power forecast (updated hourly) Actual wind power Example: Texas’ wind power production forecasts Importance of Wind and Solar Forecasting • High penetrations of variable RE increase the variability and uncertainty associated with power system operation • Integrating wind and solar forecasts into scheduling and dispatch operations reduces uncertainty, helping to lower costs and improve reliability 11 Each figure shows the dispatch stack for one day for the Day-ahead forecast (top row) and Real-time markets (bottom row) Source: Brancucci Martinez-Anido et al. (2016). Solar Energy 129. Forecast improvement Example: Solar power under-forecast How Do System Operators Use Forecasts? Part 1 • Long-term forecasts (1 week+) – Estimates of “typical” generation used for resource and O&M planning • Day-ahead unit commitment – Day-ahead forecast, along with uncertainty band, is fed into scheduling and market decisions • Intra-day adjustments – Meteorologist flags changes to real-time traders – Reconfigure peaking plant schedules Days Time of Day (hr) Adapted from Justin Sharp 12 • Hour-ahead scheduling and trading – Meteorologist provides high/low uncertainty band – Use revised forecasts to optimize resources, markets, transmission; trading with neighbors • Intra-hour dispatch – Value of forecast shifts to control room – Operators move other generators up/down in response to fluctuations – Assess reserves • Are reserves sufficient to last until next dispatch interval? • Can we handle ramps? • Are peaking resources needed? How Do System Operators Use Forecasts? Part 2 Time of Day (hr) minutes to hours Adapted from Justin Sharp 13 How Do System Operators Use Forecasts? Part 2 14 • A renewable energy ramp is a significant, sustained change in output due to changing resource conditions (i.e., wind speed, solar irradiance). • There is no standard definition of what constitutes a ramp in renewable energy output, and ramps that are important in one system may be trivial in another. 0.00 50.00 100.00 150.00 200.00 250.00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24Megawatts (MW) Operating hour Wind power forecast Day-ahead forecast Actual generation False positive: Ramp forecasted, but no ramp occurred. True positive: Ramp forecasted, ramp occurred. Forecasting Leads to Economic and Operational Benefits • Improved unit commitment and dispatch efficiency – Utilization of least expensive units – Less “mileage” on operating units – Less starting of gas turbines and other fast acting units • Reduced reserve levels – Regulation reserve – Flexible/load following reserve • Decreased curtailment of RE generation 15 The Value of Forecasting: Xcel Energy Case Study • Leading utility wind provider in the United States, and top 10 for solar. – 15% of total energy supply from wind in 2014 – Up to roughly 70% instantaneous wind penetration – 5,794 MW wind capacity installed • Partnered with two national laboratories to develop a state- of-the art forecasting model, which is maintained by a third party Sources: Staton 2015; NCAR 2015; Xcel Energy 2015 Outcomes: – Reduced average forecast error from 16.8% in 2009 to 10.10% in 2014 – Saved ratepayers US $49.0 million over the 2010-2014 period 16 Factors that Influence Forecasting Benefits Physical Drivers • The variability of the VRE resource • Network size • Generation resource mix • Penetration level of wind and/or solar Institutional Drivers • System operational practices, market design (e.g., scheduling, dispatch) • Regulations and incentives/penalties • Forecast timescale, accuracy, and reliability • Operator confidence in the forecast • How the forecast is used Forecasting is not a silver bullet! It must be integrated with other flexibility solutions that favor VRE integration. Adapted from Justin Sharp 17 More Frequent Decisions Reduce Uncertainty Source: Harnessing Variable Renewables -- A Guide to the Balancing Challenge, International Energy Agency, 2011 18 While more frequent forecasts provide greater accuracy, they are only useful to the system operator up to the timeframe in which actions can be taken in response to the forecast.

Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) Models (National Meteorological Agencies) Weather data (Meteorological stations) Wind and solar plant data (Generating units) Power Prediction Systems (In-house, vendors) Power Prediction National Environmental Prediction Measured Data Adapted from Justin Sharp 21 Forecasting Methods • Physical (dynamical) methods – Inputs weather data (temperature, pressure, surface roughness, obstacles) into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to create terrain-specific weather conditions 0.00 50.00 100.00 150.00 200.00 250.00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24Wind output (MW) Operating hour Persistence Forecast (Hour-ahead) Actual generation• Statistical methods – Uses historic and real-time generation data to statistically correct results derived from NWP models. – Persistence forecasting: uses the last observation as the next forecast. • Ensemble forecasting – Aggregates results from multiple different forecasts 22 Producing Forecasts: Timescales, Methods Type of Forecast Time Horizon Methods Generation Intra-hour 5-60 min Statistical, persistence Short term 1-6 hours ahead Blend of statistical and NWP models Medium term Day(s) ahead NWP with corrections for systematic biases Long term Week(s), Seasonal, 1 year or more ahead Climatological forecasts, NWP Decision support Ramp forecasting Continuous NWP and statistical Load forecasting Day ahead, hour-ahead, intra-hour. Statistical 23 What Impacts Forecast Quality? Examples: • Meteorological data – e.g., density and frequency of observations • NWP models – e.g., data assimilation, parameterization – Resolution—e.g., ability to represent terrain features that impact RE resource • Operational information for wind and solar generators – e.g., turbine or panel availability, curtailment • Power conversion algorithms 24 Example: Impact of Terrain and Spatial Resolution of Model Altitude (m) Terrain can have a significant impact on wind speed and direction Example: Impact of Terrain and Spatial Resolution of Model Mountain Range appears as a smooth dip at 27 km spatial resolution Illustrative example adapted from Justin Sharp, Sharply Focused 27 km Model Resolution Altitude (m) Contours of rolling terrain not represented at 27 km resolution 27 km Example: Impact of Terrain and Spatial Resolution of Model Illustrative example adapted from Justin Sharp, Sharply Focused Details of peaks and valleys not represented at 9 km resolution 27 km Model Resolution 9 km Altitude (m) 9 km Example: Impact of Terrain and Spatial Resolution of Model Illustrative example adapted from Justin Sharp, Sharply Focused 27 km Model Resolution 9 km 3 km Peak and valley represented at 3 km resolution Altitude (m) 3 km CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING FORECASTING SYSTEMS 29 Different Roles for Centralized vs. Decentralized Forecasts Centralized Forecasting (by the system operator) • Enables the use of forecasting in unit commitment and dispatch • Requires mechanisms to obtain data from generators and encourage data quality • Allows greater consistency and reduces uncertainty at the system level Decentralized Forecasting (by the generator) • Used by off-takers when making offers • Helps project operators optimize operation and maintenance • Informs operators of potential transmission congestion • Limited scope can decrease utility 30 Centralized forecasting by the system operator, supported by generator-level forecasts from the plant operator, is widely considered a best practice approach. Who Accrues the Benefits of Improved Forecasting (and Bears the Risks of Poor Forecasting)? Consumers Utilities Variable Generation Plant Owners Independent System Operators (ISOs) Those who bear the risks (financial, reliability) have the strongest interest in improving wind and solar forecasting 31 Understanding How Forecasts Can Impact Decisions • Who will use forecasts, and how will they use them? – Market operations/scheduling – Transmission and distribution system operations? • What time intervals and horizons are needed? – Hourly, 15 minute, day ahead, day of, hour ahead, etc. 32 • Point estimates (deterministic forecasts) can provide false sense of certainty • Estimates of forecast uncertainty (probabilistic methods) can be extremely useful if the system has a good way of using the additional information -50 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24Megawatts (MW) Hour Day-ahead forecast Point forecast Probabalistic forecast Monitoring and Verification is an Essential Component of Forecasting Purposes of forecast verification: 1. Monitor forecast quality - how accurate are the forecasts and are they improving over time? 2. Improve forecast quality - the first step toward getting better is discovering what you're doing wrong. 3. Compare the quality of different forecast systems and a baseline - to what extent does one forecast system give better forecasts than another, and in what ways is that system better? 4. Financial verification – ensuring that generator reporting matches actual conditions Adapted from Justin Sharp 33 Common Forecast Metrics Forecast error is the difference between predicted and real-time generation from non-dispatchable VRE resources • Mean bias error (MBE) – Indicates whether the model is systematically under- or over- forecasting • Mean absolute error (MAE) – Measures the average accuracy of forecasts without considering error direction • Root mean square error (RMSE) – Measures the average accuracy of forecasts without considering error direction and gives a relatively high weight to large errors All metrics are wrong, but some are useful Error rates are not static; they vary based on time of year, extent of spatial or geographic aggregation, among many other factors 34 Where are Improvements Needed? Regulation Dispatch Dispatch Curtailment Unit Start Up 35 The system was designed to accommodate small amounts of uncertainty. Large forecast errors are the most costly. Forecast error (MW) Data Collection Strategies for System Operators • Policy mandates – May be implemented for utility- scale and distributed generation – FERC Order 764 • Interconnection or market requirements set by federal and state government, utilities, and RTO/ISO • Power purchase agreements • Penalties/rewards • Partnerships with meteorological agencies • Third-party vendors 36 Xcel Energy’s Model PPA includes provisions for forecasting data collection http://www.xcelenergy.com/staticfiles/xe/Corporate/Corp orate%20PDFs/Model_Power_Purchase_Agreement.pdf What Data is Needed to Set up a Forecasting System? Static • Plant location (Latitude, Longitude) • Installed Capacity • Historic Data (training data) Dynamic • Real-Time Generation • Availability Data • Park Potential (potential total output based on available resources at the wind/solar farm level) • Meteorological Data 37 Options for Procuring Forecasts • In-house Forecasting – Staff meteorologists/analysts develop power prediction models and are responsible for assembling and validating meteorological and plant data. – Can allow flexibility for custom and state-of-the-art approaches that reflect system-specific concerns. – Will be significantly more expensive to develop and require significantly more computing power and expertise to maintain than vendor forecasts. • Third-Party Vendors – Vendor uses proprietary power prediction models to estimate generation. – Requires wind and solar plant data from generators or the system operator. – In-house meteorologists still play a role in reviewing forecasts and identifying critical periods. – Typical forecasts are selling for USD $200/project/month to $2000/project/month (source: Justin Sharp) 38 Working with vendors can be an inexpensive, introductory way to get experience with forecasting. This can be a valuable first step. ACTIONS TO SUPPORT FORECASTING SYSTEMS 39 Example Areas for Early Actions • Update interconnection standards, power purchase agreements to enable data gathering • Work with national meteorological institutes to improve underlying weather data or access to it • Facilitate training of operators on meteorology, how to interpret forecasts, and work with vendors • Support vendor trials and development of a smooth IT interface between forecast vendors and users 40 Key Takeaways • Forecasting facilitates the integration of variable renewable energy to the grid by reducing uncertainty and improving the efficiency of operations at multiple timescales. • Better information is only valuable when it leads to better decisions – Understanding areas where forecasting improves decision-making is a first step in considering how to implement forecasting systems – Interpreting forecasts is a critical element of effective implementation • Centralized and decentralized have unique value; in general, moving toward centralized forecasting is most effective in reducing uncertainty at the system level. • There is no one-size-fits-all approach to collecting data and procuring and monitoring forecasts. Power systems should tailor their forecasting programs to their unique context and needs. 41 QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION 42 Contacts and Additional Information Webinar Panel Greening the Grid greeningthegrid.org Email: greeningthegrid@nrel.gov Bri-Mathias Hodge, Ph.D. National Renewable Energy Laboratory Email: Bri.Mathias.Hodge@nrel.gov Jennifer Leisch, Ph.D. United States Agency for International Development Email: jleisch@usaid.gov 43 Learn more at greeningthegrid.org 44","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
