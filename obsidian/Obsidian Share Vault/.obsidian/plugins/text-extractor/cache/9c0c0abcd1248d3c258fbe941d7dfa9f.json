The demand for solar photovoltaic (PV) system is growing rapidly driven by new technology and strong economies of scale. PV systems directly convert solar energy into electricity without release any pollution into the environment and deplete natural resources. PV technology has matured and its reliability keeps improving. However, PV system is more expensive to produce than conventional sources of energy due in part to the cost of manufacturing PV devices and in part to the conversion efficiencies of the equipment. Besides, important attention in designing, developing and installing the PV systems is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to predict the PV systems behaviour and performance by considering the plausible factors. The factors accept in this model are solar irradiance and manufacturers' information for the type of PV panel. A case study at the eastern part of Peninsular Malaysia was conducted to examine the effect of factors on the performance of PV. Through the comparative analysis, the results have a good agreement. 1. Introduction Solar energy is available directly from the sunshine. The sunlight will convert to electricity by solar cells in environmentally friendly. The solar energy is a renewable resource which available in local. This will reduce environmental impacts and also reduces our dependence on imported oil. Electricity is one of the most essential assets in our lives because it does not only increase the economic and social development but also improve human health and welfare as well as [1]. Malaysia is one of the countries that is currently experiencing economic growth and rapid social development. Therefore, electricity demand has risen sharply. Beginning 1981, Malaysia has taken the momentous step to introduce the Four Fuel Diversification Policy which focuses on renewable energy (RE) which is consisting of solar photovoltaic (PV), biomass, small hydro and biogas. Before the establishment of the Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA) in 2011, RE was less than 0.2% of the total electricity generation mix. With strong efforts driven by the NREPAP and Feed-in Tariff (FiT), the RE mix has increased to 2% (estimated 3,171 GWh) in 2015, with a compounded annual growth rate of 59% from 2006. The government of Malaysia is empowering renewable energy in order to ensure resilient and sustainable economic production for a long time [2].","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
