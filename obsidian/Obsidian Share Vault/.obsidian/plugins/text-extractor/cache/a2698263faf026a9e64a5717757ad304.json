Speciﬁcally, closed-form approx- imate expressions for the probability density function, cumula- tive distribution function, and moment generating function are derived, and their accuracies are corroborated through Monte Carlo simulations for several representative examples. Index Terms—Correlated Weibull sums, probability density function, cumulative distribution function, Meijer’s G-function. I. INTRODUCTION The probability density function (PDF) and the moment- generating function (MGF) of the sum of random variables (RVs) are very useful statistics to investigate the performance of wireless communication systems operating under multipath fading channels. In many practical combining techniques, such as maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and equal-gain combining (EGC), it is indispensable to compute either the PDF or the MGF of the sum of random variables in order to examine the performance of such receivers. Along the years, Weibull random variable (WRV) has been widely used to model the fading amplitude in both indoor and outdoor communication environments [1]. A usual remark is that, the exact analytical expressions of several performance criteria contain deﬁnite integrals that are very difﬁcult, if not impossible, to be solved analytically. Thus, an alternative and efﬁcient way is to propose tight approximations with reason- able evaluation time for either PDF or MGF expressions of the sum of n arbitrary WRVs. In [2], accurate approximations to the sum of independent α-µ RVs were proposed by making use of moment-based estimators. Two methods aiming to estimate the outage capacity of both MRC and EGC combiners have been investigated for Log-normal and Nakagami-m fading channels in [3]. In [4], the distribution of the ratio, product, and sum of two Weibull RVs are investigated. In [5]-[8], the PDF of uncorrelated Weibull sums has been approximated by a type IV H-distribution [9] relying on the moment-based density approximants methods [10]. In this case, the parameters of the Fox’s H-function [9, Eq. (1.2)], which generalizes the Meijer’s G-function [9, Eq. (1.112)], have been estimated by computing the three ﬁrst moments of the exact distribution, and the results were partly accurate, in particular for high values of n. In this letter, differently from previous works, we focus on the correlated Weibull scenario. In particular, we extend the main idea on [8] for correlated Weibull fading so that we F. El Bouanani is with Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco D. B. da Costa is with Federal University of Cear´a (UFC), Cear´a, Brazil approximate the respective sums by a type I/II H-distribution. To this end, we evaluate its ﬁve ﬁrst moments instead of only the three ﬁrst ones of the type VI H-distribution, as proposed in [8]. Accurate approximate expressions for the PDF, cumulative distribution function (CDF) and MGF are derived and corroborated through Monte Carlo simulations. The remainder of this letter can be structured as follows. Section II presents a new tight approximate expressions for PDF, CDF, and MGF of correlated Weibull sums in terms of Meijer’s G-function. In Section III, the results are illustrated for both correlated and uncorrelated cases, and veriﬁed by comparison with the recent results. Section VI summarizes the main conclusions. II. APPROXIMATE APPROACH Let (Xi)1≤i≤n be n correlated Weibull RVs with shape and scale parameter βi and ωi, respectively. The PDF of Xi can be written as fXi (x) = βi ωi ( x ωi )βi−1 exp [ − ( x ωi )βi] , x ≥ 0. (1) Proposition 1. The PDF of X = ∑n i=1 Xi can be tightly approximated by the following expression fX (x) ≈ a1G 2,0 1,2 ( x a2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ −; a3 a4, a5 ) , x ≥ 0, (2) where G .,. .,. (. ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ .; . .; . ) denotes the Meijer’s G-function, and a1 = Γ(a3 + 1) a2Γ(a4 + 1)Γ(a5 + 1) , (3) a3 = 4ϕ4 − 9ϕ3 + 6ϕ2 − µ1 −ϕ4 + 3ϕ3 − 3ϕ2 + µ1 , (4) a2 = a3 2 (ϕ4 − 2ϕ3 + ϕ2) + 2ϕ4 − 3ϕ3 + ϕ2, (5) a4 = a6 + a7 2 , (6) a5 = a6 − a7 2 , (7) with a6 = a3 (ϕ2 − µ1) + 2ϕ2 − µ1 a2 − 3, (8) a7 = √( a3 (ϕ2 − µ1) + 2ϕ2 − µ1 a2 − 1)2 − 4 µ1(a3 + 1) a2 , (9) 2162-2337 (c) 2017 IEEE.

(10) Above, µi is the ith moment of the RV X, and Γ (·) represents the Gamma function [13, Eq. (6.1.1)]. Proof: Firstly, note that RVs are equal iff all their moments are equal. Thus, relying on the Mellin transform of the Meijer’s G-function [9, Eq. (2.9)], the ﬁrst ﬁve moments can be written as µi = a1a i+1 2 Γ(a4 + i + 1)Γ(a5 + i + 1) Γ(a3 + i + 1) , i = 0, .., 4. (11) Taking into account that µ0 = 1 and using [13, Eq. (6.1.15)], (3) can be attained. Also, we get the following equalities a2 (a4a5 + i(a4 + a5) + i 2) = ϕi(a3 + i), i = 1, .., 4. (12) Now, performing some algebraic operations, we get { a2(a4+1)(a5+1) = µ1(a3+1) a2(a4+a5+2i + 1) = a3 (ϕi+1−ϕi) +2ϕi+1−ϕi, i ≤ 3 . (13) which yields (5) and the following equality a3 (ϕ4 − 2ϕ3 + ϕ2) + 4ϕ4 − 6ϕ3 + 2ϕ2 = µ1 + 3ϕ3 +a3 (ϕ3 − 2ϕ2 + µ1) − 4ϕ2 (14) which, by its turn, is used for determining (4). Moreover, we have { (a4 + 1)(a5 + 1) = µ1(a3+1) a2 a4 + a5 + 1 = a6 . (15) Finally, by solving the above system, the coefﬁcients given by (6) and (7) can be obtained, which concludes the proof. ■ Now, let’s deﬁne the function dk(x) = Γ(1 + k/x). As the jth moment of Xi is ωj i dj (βi) , the expectation of X =∑n i=1 Xi can be expressed as µ1 = n∑ i=1 ωid1 (βi) , (16) Thus, using the multinomial theorem and [11, Eq. (4.2)], we get the second moment in (17), the third moment in (18), and the fourth moment in (19), shown at the bottom of the next page, i.e., µ2 = n∑ i=1 ω2 i d2 (βi) + 2 n−1∑ i=1 n∑ j=i+1 ∆ (1, 1, βi, βj, ωi, ωj, ξij) , (17) where the function ∆(.) is deﬁned in (20), the product of the moments of three Weibull RVs [12, Eq. (6)] is provided in (21), shown at the bottom of the last page, E [·] denotes expectation, and ξij is related to the correlation coefﬁcient ρij between two RVs Xi and Xj, being deﬁned as [11] ρij = ∆(1,1,βi,βj ,1,1,ξij ) ωiωj − d1 (βi) d1 (βj) √ g1(βi)g1(βj) , (22) with gk(βi) = d2k (βi) − d 2 k (βi) , (23) ϵp = { 1, p = 0 2 elsewhere , (24) Ω (i,j,k) = [C (i,j,k)]−1 , (25) and C (i,j,k) mn denotes the covariance matrix of the complex Gaussian RVs of envelopes X βi/2 i , X βj /2 j , and X βk/2 k : C (i,j,k) =    ωβi i δij δik δij ωβj j δjk δik δjk ωβk k    , (26) with δmn is given in terms of the hypergeometric function as δmn = ωβm/2 m ωβn/2 n arg 0≤x≤1 [ 4d 2 ξmn (2) πdξmn (1) = 2F1 ( −1 2 , −1 2 ; 1; x2)] , (27) vmn = [Ω (i,j,k) mn ]2 (Ω(i,j,k) mm Ω (i,j,k) nn )−1 , (28) χ (i,j,k) = χij + χik + χjk, (29) χmn = { 0, Ω (i,j,k) mn ≥ 0 π, elsewhere , (30) It is noteworthy that for the uncorrelated case, ρij = 0 and then ξij = 1. On the other hand, if all βi are equal and ξij = 0, we have ρij = 1. Corollary 1. The CDF and MGF of X = ∑n i=1 Xi can be tightly approximated, respectively, by FX (x) ≈ a1a2G 2,1 2,3 ( x a2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1; a3 + 1 a4 + 1, a5 + 1; 0 ) , x ≥ 0. (31) MX (t) ≈ a1 t G 2,1 2,2 ( 1 a2t ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 0; a3 a4, a5 ) , t ≥ 0. (32) Proof: Let C be a complex contour of integration ensuring the convergence of the Meijer G-function given in (2). Using [13, Eq. (6.1.15)], (31) can be deduced using the following integration FX (x)≈ a1 2πj ∫ C Γ(a4+s)Γ(a5+s) Γ(a3+s) 1 a −s 2 ∫ x 0 t−sdtds (33) ≈ a1a2 2πj ∫ C Γ(a4+1 + s)Γ(a5+1 + s)Γ(−s) Γ(a3 + 1 + s)Γ(−s + 1) ( x a2 )−s ds. On the other hand, the MGF of X can be deﬁned by MX (t) = ∫ ∞ 0 e−txfX (x)dx. (34) Finally, by substituting (2) and [9, Eq. (2.19)] into (34), we arrive at (32), which concludes the proof of the corollary. ■ µ3 =    ∑n i=1 ω3 i d3 (βi) + 3 ∑n i=1 ∑n j=1 j̸=i ∆ (1, 2, βi, βj, ωi, ωj, ξij) + 6 ∑n−2 i=1 ∑n−1 j=i+1 ∑n k=j+1 E [XiXjXk] , n ≥ 3 ω3 1d3 (β1) + ω3 2d3 (β2) + 3∆ (1, 2, β1, β2, ω1, ω2, ξ12) + 3∆ (2, 1, β1, β2, ω1, ω2, ξ12) , n = 2 ω3 1d3 (β1) , n = 1 ,(18) 2162-2337 (c) 2017 IEEE.

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND SIMULATIONS In this Section, representative numerical examples are plot- ted in order to show the accuracy of the proposed approxima- tions. The Monte Carlo simulation is performed by generating 107n random numbers with PDF given in (1) using the method presented in [14], which is based on using correlated Gaussian distributed RVs having the correlation coefﬁcient ρ(n) ij . Without loss of generality, we assume that ωi = 1. Fig. 1 depicts the approximate PDF of the sum of three identical correlated Weibull RVs assuming βi = β = 1.5, 2.25, 4. The correlation coefﬁcients are set ρ12 = 0.6, ρ13 = 0.38, ρ23 = 0.2, while ρ(n) ij are evaluated using [14, Eq. (14)], as summarized in Table I. As can be seen, the proposed approximation is highly precise compared with the approach presented in [8] for various values of the shape parameter. In Fig 2, high accuracy of the proposed approximations is clearly observed in both correlated and uncorrelated cases, for ﬁxed β = 3 and high values of n (n = 10, 25, 50). We notice that the curves move to the right as the expectation of the sum becomes greater. Table II summarizes the ﬁve parameters of the Meijer’s G-function associated to Fig. 2. It can be observed that the higher is n, the smaller are a1 and a2. Fig. 3 shows both approximated and simulated CDF computed in the case of four exponentially correlated Weibull RVs assuming (ρij = ϱ|i−j| with i, j = 1, .., n) assuming β = 1, 2.5, and ϱ = 0, 0.5. It can be noticed also that the curves match well over the entire range in all cases. Moreover, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test performed for n ≤ 50, ϱ = 0, 0.9, β = 3, and signiﬁcance value α = 5% shows that the goodness-of-ﬁt computed by TABLE II PARAMETERS’ VALUES CORRESPONDING TO FIG. 2.

In Fig. 4, the MGF of the sum of ﬁve exponentially correlated Weibull RVs is plotted for ϱ = 0, 0.8 and β = 2, 4. A part of the input correlation matrix’s ﬁrst line for the correlated case, i.e, ϱ = 0.8) is summarized in Table III. In addition to the high accuracy indistinguishability of proposed and exact curves, it can be observed that the MGF decreases for uncorrelated WRV sums as the scale parameter becomes large. IV. CONCLUSION New highly accurate approximate expressions of the PDF, CDF, and MGF of correlated Weibull RVs sums have been derived in this letter. Numerical results prove that the analytical curves matched perfectly the simulated ones for both corre- lated and uncorrelated cases and various values of the shape parameter and correlation coefﬁcients even for large number of RVs. µ4=    ∑n i=1 ω4 i d4(βi) + 6 ∑n−1 i=1 ∑n j=i+1 E [X 2 i X 2 j ] +4 ∑n−1 i=1 ∑n j=i+1 E [ X 3 i Xj] +8 ∑n−2 i=1 ∑n−1 j=i+1 ∑n k=j+1 E [ X 2 i XjXk] +4 ∑n i=1 ∑n−1 j=1 j̸=i ∑n k=j+1 E [ X 2 i XjXk] +24 ∑ i̸=j̸=k̸=l E [XiXjXkXl] , n ≥ 4 ∑3 i=1 ω4 i d4(βi) + 6 ∑2 i=1 ∑3 j=i+1 E [ X 2 i X 2 j ] +4 ∑3 i=1 ∑3 j=1 j̸=i E [ X 3 i Xj] +12 ( E [ X 2 1 X2X3] + E [ X 2 2 X1X3]) . +12E [ X 2 3 X1X2] , n = 3 ω4 1d4(β1) + ω4 2d4(β2) + 4 ( E [ X 3 1 X2] + E [ X1X 3 2 ]) +6E [X 2 1 X 2 2 ] , n = 2 ω4 1d4(β1), n = 1 (19) ∆ (αi, αj, βi, βj, ωi, ωj, ξij) = E [ X αi i X αj j ] = dαiξij (βi) dαj ξij (βj) d1 ( βiβj αiβj +αj βi ) dξij ( βiβj αiβj +αj βi ) ωαi i ωαj j .
