The goal of an investor having an initial capital x ≥ 0 is to hedge dynamically a given random variable H which represents the payoﬀ of a ﬁnancial contract at some future date T > 0. He is looking for a trading strategy π such that the related portfolio wealth X x,π T at T exceeds H almost surely, i.e. P (X x,π T ≥ H) = 1. (1.1) A strategy π satisfying (1.1) is called a hedging or superhedging strategy for H and it is well known that it exists if x is greater than the superhedging price of H. In the opposite case each trading strategy is able to hedge the claim at most partially, i.e. P (X x,π T ≥ H) < 1, and hence generates the shortfall (H − X x,π T ) + := max{0, H − X x,π T } 1 which is strictly positive with positive probability. The related shortfall risk which appears in that case should be minimized to protect the investor against the resulting loss. There is an extensive literature on minimizing shortfall risk, see for instance [1], [2], [4], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13],[14], [15], [16], [19], with various risk measures accepted by the investor. Four of those measures listed below play a central role in our study. In the quantile hedging approach, introduced in [9], the objective was to maximize the probability of a successful hedge, i.e. max π P (X x,π T ≥ H). (1.2) The drawback of (1.2) of neglecting the portfolio performance on the set {X x,π T < H} has been partially eliminated in [9] in the generalized version of (1.2) which is max π E [ϕx,π] , where ϕx,π := 1 ∧ X x,π T where k > K is a certain constant which depends on x. Thus the related shortfall equals H − X x,˜π T = (ST − k) + + (k − K)1{ST >k}. In particular, it is clear that the shortfall is unbounded on the set {ST > k} which implies a positive ruin probability for each investor regardless of the level of his solvency. An analogous example can be constructed for (1.4) with l(z) = z and the claim H := 1 variables, which exceed a prespeciﬁed test ϕ∗. We call each test of this a conditional test with a rejection threshold ϕ∗. In the presented framework ϕ∗ is determined by H and L. Our approach is a modiﬁcation of the celebrated quantile hedging method applied in [9] and [10] and generalizes the results where the shortfall proﬁle was unconstrained. This particular situation corresponds to the condition L = H which generates the trivial rejection threshold ϕ∗ ≡ 0. In Lemma 4.1 we prove a generalized version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma for conditional statistical tests. This enables us to ﬁnd the explicit form of optimal solutions in the case when the market is complete and the laws of ZH and ZL are free of positive atoms, where Z stands for the density of the martingale measure, see Proposition 4.3 for details. As a consequence we obtain a precise characterization of optimal strategies in the Black-Scholes and exponential Poisson model. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the market model and formulate the optimization problems in a precise way. The main results characterizing optimal strategies with shortfall constraints are proven in Section 3. The concept of a conditional statistical test is discussed in Section 4 where also a generalized version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma is proven and its application to determining optimal payoﬀs is shown. Examples are presented in Section 5. 2 Formulations of the problems We will consider a continuous time ﬁnancial market of a general form, studied in [7], where the stock price is given by an Rd-valued locally bounded semimartingale (St)t∈[0,T ] on a ﬁltered probability space (Ω, (Ft)t∈[0,T ], F = FT , P ) with T < +∞. Trading positions are represented by pairs (x, π), where x ≥ 0 stands for an initial capital of the investor and (πt)t∈[0,T ] is a predictable, S-integrable stochastic process describing the trading strategy, that is, the wealth allocation between stocks. The resulting gain process (π · S)t := ∫ t 0 π(s)dS(s), t ∈ [0, T ], is assumed to be uniformly bounded from below, i.e. there exists a constant m ≥ 0 such that (π · S)t ≥ −m for each t ∈ [0, T ] a.s.. The class of all such strategies will be denoted by Π. If the wealth process corresponding to (x, π), x ≥ 0, π ∈ Π given by X x,π t := x + (π · S)t, t ∈ [0, T ], satisﬁes X x,π T ≥ 0, a.s., then (x, π) will be called admissible. For the sake of simplicity we assume that the risk-free interest rate equals zero, i.e. r = 0, so the value of 1 Euro on a savings account is constant in time. Let us deﬁne K := {X = X 0,π T = (π · S)T , π ∈ Π}, a set of ﬁnal portfolio values attained from zero initial capital and a set C := {Y ∈ L∞(Ω, F, P ) : Y ≤ X for some X ∈ K} 4 of all bounded random variables dominated by some element of K. The model admits no free lunch with vanishing risk NFLVR if ¯C ∩ L∞ + (Ω, F, P ) = {0}, where ¯C stands for the closure of C in L∞(Ω, F, P ) and L∞ + (Ω, F, P ) consists of all non-negative elements of L∞(Ω, F, P ). The NFLVR condition precludes arbitrage opportunities from the market, which means that there are no risk-free investments generating proﬁts. If NFLVR is violated then there is a sequence of strategies πn ∈ Π such that the corresponding gains satisfy (πn · S)T −→ Y, (πn · S)T ≥ Y − 1 generalized to the case when (St) is a semimartingale which is not necessarily locally bounded, see Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 5.12 in [7]. In this case the set Q, however, must be replaced with the set of all sigma-martingale measures and the superhedging strategy against H for x = supQ∈Q EQ[H] < +∞ exists in an extended class of strategies satisfying certain technical conditions, see Theorem 5.5 in [7]. The choice of a model with a locally bounded semimartingale (St) seems to keep a good balance between the generality of our consideration and clarity of presentation. Let us consider the situation when the initial capital x does not allow to superhedge H, i.e. satisﬁes 0 < x < p(H). It follows from Theorem 2.1 that then (2.2) is violated and hence each strategy π ∈ Π is biased by hedging risk with positive probability, that is P ((H − X x,π T ) + > 0) > 0. The problem of the investor is to minimize the risk which is quantiﬁed by a properly chosen risk measure. A component of the risk measures considered in the sequel is a condition describing a maximal size of the shortfall (H − X x,π T )+ which is acceptable by the trader. A shortfall constraint is deﬁned by an FT -measurable random variable L satisfying the condition 0 ≤ L ≤ H, (2.4) and it constitutes those admissible strategies as acceptable which satisfy P ( (H − X x,π T ) + ≤ L) = 1. (2.5) The condition (2.4) precludes trading strategies with shortfall exceeding the value of the contract. It is intuitively clear that the initial capital and the shortfall constraint should be related to each other, that is portfolios with a restricted shortfall should keep the initial cost at a suﬃciently high level. Indeed, due to the positivity of L, we have (H − X x,π T ) + ≤ L ⇐⇒ H − X x,π T ≤ L, which implies that under (2.4) the condition (2.5) is equivalent to P (X x,π T ≥ H − L) = 1. Hence (x, π) hedges the claim H − L and consequently x ≥ p(H − L). (2.6) Below we give some natural examples of shortfall constraints corresponding to various forms of the trader’s risk aversion. Examples a) If L = H then (2.5) boils down to the positivity of X x,π T and hence the proﬁle of the shortfall remains unconstrained. This case corresponds to the classical framework considered in the literature. b) For L = 0 the trader is expected to hedge the claim H, so no shortfall is acceptable at all. 6 c) The trader can cover the arising portfolio loss providing that it lies below a ﬁxed constant level c > 0. The maximal value of c is deﬁned by the solvency of the trader. In this case we set L = c ∧ H. d) Generalizing the previous example, the trader may want to keep the loss below c and simul- taneously hedge H in some ﬁxed price range [a, b] of the underlying stock. Then L is given by L = (c ∧ H)1{ST <a} + (c ∧ H)1{ST >b}. e) In the subjective forecast of the trader the stock price range (0, a), (b, +∞) is viewed as unrealistic and hence ruled out as source of risk. The trader’s aim is to keep the shortfall below c only in the interval [a, b]. The related form of L is L = (c ∧ H)1{ST ∈[a,b]} + H1{ST /∈[a,b]}. f) Let α ∈ [0, 1] describe a partial recovery of the claim, i.e. the claim which is to be hedged is αH. Then L is equal to L = (1 − α)H. Our aim is to solve the classical optimization problems (1.2), (1.3), (1.4) and (1.5) which are adapted to the new framework with a constrained shortfall proﬁle. For a given triplet (x, H, L), which in view of the discussion above satisﬁes p(H) = supQ∈Q EQ[H] < +∞, (2.4), (2.5) and (2.6), we are looking for a strategy π ∈ Π such that (x, π) is admissible and solves    minπ∈Π r(H, X x,π T ) (i) P ((H − X x,π T )+ ≤ L) = 1 (ii) p(H − L) ≤ x < p(H). (2.7) Recall that p(H) stands for the price of H and is given by (2.3). Above r(H, X x,π T ) describes the shortfall risk of the pair (x, π) and (2.7) will be investigated for its four concrete forms. For r(H, X x,π T ) := P (X x,π T < H), we obtain the quantile hedging problem (QH). To the generalized quantile hedging problem (GQH) corresponds r(H, X x,π T ) := E [(1 − X x,π T The loss function in WES is state dependent, i.e. l : Ω×[0, +∞) −→ [0, +∞) and such that l(ω, ·) is continuous, increasing and l(ω, 0) = 0 for each ω ∈ Ω. We also assume that E[l(H)] < +∞, so the risk measure of any admissible strategy in WES is well deﬁned. For the shortfall risk quantiﬁed by r (H, X x,π T ) = ρ (−(H − X x,π T ) +) , where ρ is a convex risk measure, (2.7) will be denoted by CRM. Recall that ρ : Lp −→ R with Lp = Lp(Ω, F, P ), p ≥ 1 is a convex risk measure if it satisﬁes a) Z1 ≤ Z2 =⇒ ρ(Z1) ≥ ρ(Z2), Z1, Z2 ∈ Lp, b) ρ(Z + a) = ρ(Z) − a, a ∈ R, Z ∈ Lp, c) ρ(αZ1 + (1 − α)Z2) ≤ αρ(Z1) + (1 − α)ρ(Z2), α ∈ [0, 1], Z1, Z2 ∈ Lp. If, additionally, d) ρ(αZ) = αρ(Z), α ≥ 0, Z ∈ Lp. is satisﬁed then ρ is called coherent. If L = H then the constraints (2.7)(i) and (2.7)(ii) amount to the admissibility of (x, π) and consequently (2.7) becomes a classical risk minimizing problem with an unconstrained shortfall proﬁle. 3 Optimal strategies with shortfall constraint The following result describes an optimal strategy for the problem QH. Below Ac stands for the complement of a set A. Proposition 3.1 Let p(H − L) ≤ x < p(H). If there exists a set ˜A ∈ F solving the problem    maxA P (A) (i) p(H − L1Ac) ≤ x, (3.1) then a hedging strategy (˜x, ˜π) for the claim ˜H := H − L1 ˜Ac with ˜x = p( ˜H) solves QH. Proof: Let us deﬁne a success set of a strategy (x, π) by Ax,π := {X x,π T ≥ H}. First we show that for any strategy (x, π) satisfying (2.7)(i), (ii) we have P (X x,π T ≥ H) = P (Ax,π) ≤ P ( ˜A). Since X x,π T ≥ H on Ax,π and, by (2.7)(i), X x,π T ≥ H − L a.s., it follows H − L1Ac x,π = H1Ax,π + (H − L)1Ac x,π ≤ X x,π T . 8 Using the fact that X x,π is a Q-supermartingale for each Q ∈ Q, we obtain EQ[H − L1Ac x,π ] ≤ EQ[X x,π T ] ≤ x, Q ∈ Q, which, by passing to supremum over Q ∈ Q, gives p(H − L1Ac x,π ) ≤ x, and (3.1) (i) follows. Hence P (Ax,π) ≤ P ( ˜A). Now let us consider the strategy (˜x, ˜π) and notice that the condition X ˜x,˜π T ≥ H − L1 ˜Ac implies X ˜x,˜π T ≥ H1 ˜A + (H − L)1 ˜Ac ≥ H − L, (3.2) It follows that (H − X ˜x,˜π T )+ ≤ L, which is (2.7)(i), and that ˜x ≥ p(H − L) which together with the condition ˜x = p( ˜H) ≤ x gives (2.7)(ii). Further, it follows from (3.2) that A˜x,˜π ⊇ ˜A and thus P (A˜x,˜π) ≥ P ( ˜A). Hence A˜x,˜π = ˜A and the optimality of (˜x, ˜π) follows. □ To deal with the succeeding problems we will need the success ratio of an admissible strategy (x, π) deﬁned by ϕx,π := 1 ∧ X x,π T 1, α, β ≥ 0 holds it follows that ˜ϕn also satisﬁes (3.5)(i), (ii). Hence ˜ϕ also satisﬁes (3.5)(i), (ii), so it solves (3.5). Let (x, π) be a strategy satisfying (2.7)(i), (ii). It follows from (2.7)(i) that ϕx,π = 1 ∧ X x,π T The arguments in the poof of Theorem 3.2 can be successfully applied in the case when the shortfall risk is given by r (H, X x,π T ) = ρ (−(H − X x,π T ) +) , where ρ stands for a convex risk measure on Lp, p ≥ 1. Since each convex measure on Lp is pointwise continuous, see Theorem 3.1 in [11], it follows that the pointwise convergent minimizing sequence {ϕn} for the problem min ϕ ρ (−(1 − ϕ)H) , ϕ ≥ H − L 4 Generalized Neyman-Pearson lemma and complete markets In this section we analyse the conditions describing the success ratios of optimal strategies considered in Section 3. Notice that using (2.3), which deﬁnes the superhedging price of H, the problem (3.10) can be written in the form    (i) maxϕ EP [ϕ] (ii) ϕ∗ ≤ ϕ ≤ 1, (iii) sup ˆQ∈ ˆQ E ˆQ[ϕ] ≤ x. (4.1) where ϕ∗ := H−L Proof: It is clear that ˜ϕ = ϕ∗ = 1 on the set {ϕ∗ = 1}. On the set {ϕ∗ < 1} the optimal solution ˜ϕ solves the problem    maxϕ EP [ϕ1{ϕ∗<1}] (i) ϕ∗1{ϕ∗<1} ≤ ϕ1{ϕ∗<1} ≤ 1, (ii) EQ[ϕ1{ϕ∗<1}] ≤ α − P (ϕ∗ = 1). (4.4) For any ϕ such that ϕ∗ ≤ ϕ ≤ 1 consider the transformation Φ = Φ(ϕ) := ϕ1{ϕ∗<1} − ϕ∗1{ϕ∗<1} Proposition 4.2 Let X ≥ 0, Y ≥ 0 be random variables with E[Y ] < +∞ and such that the cumulative distribution function FX (t) := P (X ≤ t), t > 0, is continuous. Then the function g(k) := E[Y 1{X<k}], k > 0, is continuous. Proof: If Y = 0 then the result is obvious. For Y ̸= 0 let us consider the measure ˆP given by d ˆP c) If the function FZ (t) = P (Z ≤ t), t ∈ R, is continuous then the solution of (3.5) with l(z) = z equals ˜ϕ = H with d ¯Q5.1 Black-Scholes model Let us recall some basics concerning the Black-Scholes model. The asset price dynamics has the form dSt = St(αdt + σdWt), S0 = s0, t ∈ [0, T ], α ∈ R, σ > 0. The unique martingale measure Q is given by dQ where e1(k) := ln ( I(k) Proof: In view of Proposition 4.3 (b), it follows that the solution ˜ϕ of (3.10) has the form ˜ϕ = 1{ZH< 1 Proof: By Proposition 4.3 (c) the solution of (3.5) is ˜ϕ = 1{ST >k} + H − L It follows that S is a local martingale under Q if and only if λQ(t) ≡ λQ = γ and γ solves the equation f (k) + γ( c ∧ (ˆy(k) − K) ) Q(ST = ˆy(k)) = x. (5.12) The corresponding shortfall equals ( c ∧ (ST − K) +) 1{ST >ˆy(k)} + (1 − γ) ( c ∧ (ˆy(k) − K) +) 1{ST =ˆy(k)}. Proof: Solving (3.10) with the use of Lemma 4.1 yields the optimal payoﬀ ˜H = H ˜ϕ = H1{ dP References [1] Cong, J., Tan, K.S., Weng, C. :”VaR-based optimal partial hedging”, (2013), ASTIN Bul- letin, 43(3), 271-299, [2] Cong, J., Tan, K.S., Weng, C. :”Conditional value-at-risk optimal partial hedging”, (2014), The Journal of Risk, 16(3), 49-83, [3] Cont, R., Tankov, P.: ”Financial modelling with jump processes”, (2004), Chapman & Hall, Boca Raton, [4] Cvitani´c, J.: ”Minimizing expected loss of hedging in incomplete and constrained markets”, (2000), SIAM J.
