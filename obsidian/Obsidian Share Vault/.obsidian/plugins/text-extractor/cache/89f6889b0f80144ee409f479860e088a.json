Included are investigations of violating constraint equations, usage of the constraint automation and performance of Pre- dispatch constraint equations. Transmission and generation changes are also detailed along with the number of constraint equation changes. 2 Constraint Equation Performance 2.1 Top 10 binding constraint equations A constraint equation is binding when the power system flows managed by it have reached the applicable thermal or stability limit or the constraint equation is setting a Frequency Control Ancillary Service (FCAS) requirement. Normally there is one constraint equation setting the FCAS requirement for each of the eight services at any time. This leads to many more hours of binding for FCAS constraint equations - as such these have been excluded from the following table.

The binding impact is used to distinguish the severity of different binding constraint equations. The binding impact of a constraint is derived by summarising the marginal value for each dispatch interval (DI) from the marginal constraint cost (MCC) re-run1 over the period considered. The marginal value is a mathematical term for the binding impact arising from relaxing the RHS of a binding constraint by one MW. As the market clears each DI, the binding impact is measured in $/MW/DI. The binding impact in $/MW/DI is a relative comparison and a helpful way to analyse congestion issues. It can be converted to $/MWh by dividing the binding impact by 12 (as there are 12 DIs per hour). This value of congestion is still only a proxy (and always an upper bound) of the value per MW of congestion over the period calculated; any change to the limits (RHS) may cause other constraints to bind almost immediately after.

It is currently used by on-line staff to create thermal overload constraint equations for power system conditions where there were no existing constraint equations or the existing constraint equations did not operate correctly. The following section details the reason for each invocation of the non-real time constraint automation constraint sets and the results of AEMO’s investigation into each case. Table 1 – Non-Real-Time Constraint Automation usage Constraint Set ID Date Time Description CA_SYDS_549FBEF5 29/12/2023 16:55 to 03/01/2024 14:20 CA_SYDS_549FBEF5 was created to manage DirectLink to prevent overloading on Mudgeeraba 1T for loss of 5T. CA_SYDS_5494AABA 20/12/2023 08:55 to 22/12/2023 15:35 CA_SYDS_5494AABA was created to manage overloading on 99F Uranquinty – Yanco 132 kV Line under system normal. CA_SYDS_549FBEF5 28/12/2023 18:35 to 28/12/2023 18:50 CA_SYDS_549FBEF5 was created to manage DirectLink to prevent overloading on Mudgeeraba 1T for loss of 5T. 2.5.1 Further Investigation CA_SYDS_549FBEF5: Constraint automation equation was invoked and binding. CA_SYDS_549FBEF5 violated in favour of N^N-LS_SVC, coupled with conservative Lismore load. Violation was cleared when Northern NSW load was radialised invoking N-X_LS_VC1+96L+967. This occurred on both 28/12/2023 and 29/12/2023. Constraint automation equation was revoked after new constraint Q>NIL_MUTX_MUTX was built to manage future violation issues. © 2024 Australian Energy Market Operator Limited The material in this publication may be used in accordance with the copyright permissions on AEMO’s website. CA_SYDS_5494AABA: Constraint automation equation was invoked and binding. Following its invocation, flows were limited on 99F from 140 MVA to 137 MVA. Constraint was revoked after new constraint N>NIL_99F was built to manage future violation issues. 2.6 Binding Dispatch Hours This section examines the number of hours of binding constraint equations on each interconnector and by region. The results are further categorized into five types: system normal, outage, FCAS (both outage and system normal), constraint automation and quick constraints. In the following graph the export binding hours are indicated as positive numbers and import with negative values. Figure 1 Interconnector binding dispatch hours The regional comparison graph below uses the same categories as in Figure 1 as well as non-conformance, network support agreement and ramping. Constraint equations that cross a region boundary are allocated to the sending end region. Global FCAS covers both global and mainland requirements. 83 52 314 41 332 399 96 87 23 27 72 -92 -94 -42 -341 -21 -86 -78 -29 -11 -53 -434 -600 -400 -200 0 200 400 600 N-Q-MNSP1 NSW1-QLD1 T-V-MNSP1 V-S-MNSP1 V-SA VIC1-NSW1Hours Binding Quick Constraint Automation FCAS Outage System Normal © 2024 Australian Energy Market Operator Limited The material in this publication may be used in accordance with the copyright permissions on AEMO’s website.

The current year is further categorised into system normal (NIL), outage, network support agreement (NSA) and negative residue constraint equation types.

Figure 4 Binding Impact comparison 2.9 Pre-dispatch RHS Accuracy Pre-dispatch RHS accuracy is measured by the comparing the dispatch RHS value and the pre-dispatch RHS value forecast four hours in the future. The following table shows the pre-dispatch accuracy of the top ten largest differences for binding (in dispatch or pre-dispatch) constraint equations. This excludes FCAS constraint equations, constraint equations that violated in Dispatch, differences larger than ±9500 (this is to exclude constraint equations with swamping logic) and constraint equations that only bound for one or two Dispatch intervals. AEMO investigates constraint equations that have a Dispatch/Pre-dispatch RHS difference greater than 5% and ten absolute difference which have either bound for greater than 25 dispatch intervals or have a greater than $1,000 binding impact. The investigations are detailed in 2.9.1.

V::N_NIL_O1: Investigated and no improvement can be made to the constraint equation at this stage. V::N_NIL_O2: Investigated and no improvement can be made to the constraint equation at this stage. N>>NIL_998: Investigated and no improvement can be made to the constraint equation at this stage. N>NIL_LSDU: Investigated and no improvement can be made to the constraint equation at this stage. N>NIL_997/1_62: Investigated and no improvement can be made to the constraint equation at this stage. V::N_HWSM_V1: Investigated and no improvement can be made to the constraint equation at this stage. V::N_NIL_V2: Investigated and no improvement can be made to the constraint equation at this stage N_X_MBTE_3B: Investigated and the mismatch was due to issues with forecasting of the Terranora load. The forecasting of the Terranora load has been improved in November 2018. N^N-LS_SVC: Investigated and constraint equation was updated on 27/08 to improve PD performance. V::N_HWSM_S1: Investigated and no improvement can be made to the constraint equation at this stage. T::T_NIL_1: Investigated and no improvement can be made to the constraint equation at this stage. © 2024 Australian Energy Market Operator Limited The material in this publication may be used in accordance with the copyright permissions on AEMO’s website. 3 Generator / Transmission Changes One of the main drivers for changes to constraint equations is from power system change, whether this is the addition or removal of plant (either generation or transmission). The following table details changes that occurred in December 2023.
