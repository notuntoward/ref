This work seeks to identify market barriers and supports for the adoption of renewable energy. A framework to represent the evaluation process for generating capacity is proposed and applied to two regions: California (CAISO), where legislation requires most electricity to be supplied by renewables by 2030, and the Mid-Atlantic (PJM), where renewables have barely penetrated the market. Generation technologies are ordered via multiobjective optimization using genetic algorithms to resolve a bounded knapsack problem. Price factors for each technology are established. A net present value is assessed for representative projects in each region and technology. Local sensitivity analysis is performed. Results suggest that capacity payments in PJM offer an incentive to fossil-fuel based plants, which calls into question the suitability of carbon pricing in the region. While solar PV has the lowest costs, profitability was highest for natural gas based plants in PJM. Sensitivity is higher in CAISO than in PJM due to lower profit margins. Renewables were selected most frequently in the cost optimization, with natural gas present in ~10% of results.

Introduction As climate change concerns have intensified, electrification of industry, transportation and heating have been explored as possible means to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from these sectors (see (Sugiyama, 2012; Lechtenböhmer, Nilsson, Åhman, & Schneider, 2016) among others). Energy use is the major driver of greenhouse gas emissions, and emerging renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines and solar panels lend themselves easily to electricity production. US electric grids, however, are still based primarily on fossil power production and renewables accounted for just over 12% of primary energy production in 2018 (US Energy Information Administration, 2019). Adoption of renewables, while increasing rapidly, is not outpacing the growth of fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, in the US. This is the case even though solar PV technology has the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2018). In fact, in 2018 the majority of new generation added to the grid was natural gas based (US Energy Information Administration, 2019), with technology lifetimes that likely extend 30-60 years into the future 1. In their seminal 2007 paper, Wüstenhagen et al. posited three critical hurdles for the adoption of renewable energy technologies: social, community and market acceptance (2007). Social acceptance, or acceptance by the public and stakeholders, seems to be well underway in the US with the vast majority of people supporting moving to 100% renewables (Roberts, 2018), even though acceptance by policy makers is far from uniform. Community acceptance, which tends to be about the implementation of 1 This is an assumption based on ages of recently retired plants. See (Mills, Wiser, & Seel, 2017) for discussion of recent power plant retirements and probable causes and drivers. Their analysis showed that ages of recently retired NGST mostly ranged from 40-60 years old, CT 40-50 years old, and CCGT 30-40 years old. 3 particular projects, is unlikely to be the hold-up since the development of these projects is distributed. This leads to a hypothesis that market acceptance, the third tier, is likely the major hold-up. This paper represents an initial exploration of this hypothesis, studying and comparing costs and profitability of generating technologies in two US markets. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents background for the study with literature review. Methods, introducing a framework for the study and placing it into the testbed regions of CAISO and PJM, are explained in section 3. The metrics and data are presented in detail. Results are presented in section 4, and discussed and interpreted in Section 5. Findings and policy implications are summarized in section 6. 2. Background and Literature Review Many energy systems models have been developed, notably MARKAL, TIMES, MESSAGE and TIMER among others (see Pfenninger et al. for a review (2014)). Cost optimization is generally the central mechanism of energy systems models, underlying half of the energy forecasts developed for the 5th meeting of the IPCC (Trutnevyte, McDowall, Tomei, & Keppo, 2016). Real solutions implemented in the UK electricity markets deviated substantially from the cost-optimal solutions projected, however (Trutnevyte, McDowall, Tomei, & Keppo, 2016). Joskow noted that while many energy models used LCOE as a comparative metric, profitability or other metrics were needed to account for dispatchability of different technologies (Joskow, 2011). Reichelstein and Sahoo applied correction factors to the LCOE to account for price differences for generated electricity (2015). In their study on including risk in evaluation of generating technologies, Gross et al. noted that since affordability from a systems view is important for policy makers, LCOE is still a key metric, even though revenues are used in decision making as well (Gross, Blyth, & Heptonstall, 2010). For this work, the elaborate energy systems models were not needed since we wished to see how typical metrics would treat individual technologies. The California Energy Commission developed a model to evaluate costs of generating units (California Energy Commission, 2016), but their model, which is specific to California, assumed a different price for each technology according to its break-even costs, which limits the application of the NPV results. The US Energy Information Administration uses and maintains the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), but it is difficult to adapt to state level analysis and uses proprietary data. The REEDS model uses least-cost optimization across the entire electricity system in the US and Canada to model expected capacity additions (Eurek, et al., 2016). Its results are used in the National Renewable Laboratory’s Annual Technology Baseline. The ATB, however, does not include NPV estimates and has very limited regionalization. For the purposes of this study, therefore, a model is developed that integrates the suggestions of Joskow (2011) and Reichelstein and Sahoo (2015), but can easily be used to understand the current situation in PJM and CAISO vis-à-vis commonly considered generation technologies. 3. Methods 3.1 Testbed The US electricity market is divided into zones as shown in Fig. 1. To study the market acceptance of renewables, we decided to look at two regions with very different profiles in terms of the adoption of renewables. The California ISO, CAISO, also includes a small area of Nevada. California has adopted requirements for the provision of 60% of electricity by renewables by 2030. Solar already provides a 4 large portion of California’s electricity. Geothermal and solar thermal technologies are viable here as well. In California, coal provides less than 1% of the electric power. CAISO operates day-ahead and real- time electricity markets. Its capacity is guaranteed in a decentralized way, with load-serving entities under an obligation to ensure that they have access to the capacity required by their customers (Bublitz et al., 2019). Fig. 1: The FERC map of US electricity markets, showing the CAISO and PJM regions in detail. PJM, which originally stood for Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland, is a regional transmission organization (RTO) covering the Mid-Atlantic as well as states extending inward to the Midwest and into the Southeast. The PJM area is not well-suited for solar thermal and no geothermal reserves are found here. Regions covered by PJM largely have wind speeds lower than 5.5 m/s (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US Department of Energy), so are outside the traditional hubs for wind development. The generation mixture has been close to 1/3 nuclear, 1/3 coal and 1/3 natural gas, although in the past couple of years the mixture has been shifting to natural gas. PJM operates day-ahead and real-time electricity markets. It also has a reliability pricing model, a capacity auction which operates 3 years ahead of time and then with balancing auctions 20, 10 and 3 months before deployment (Monitoring Analytics, LLC, 2019). 3.2 Modeling Framework 5 Fig. 2: The decision making framework explained in the paper, which focuses on steps 2 and 3. Step 1 is an exogenous signal from consumers stating that new capacity is necessary. Firms compare generation plants and devise portfolios in a comparative manner, seeking to minimize costs. Profitability is then assessed using common industry parameters to assess NPV. Investors/financing make decisions about what terms to award. Firms assign an internal rate of return (IRR) and may reject portions of the portfolio, which is then sent on for socio-political approval. A framework is proposed to approximate the interaction between various decision makers in the adoption of new capacity into the electric grid (see Fig. 2). Consumer input is exogenous, since firms make their own assessments of capacity needs, and consumers do not have a choice as to which capacity to use. Firms first seek to make a comparative assessment of different generation options. They do this using least cost type optimization in step 2, maximizing the power generated for the lowest cost. This optimization exercise gives a portfolio of projects, which then must be evaluated based on their profitability. In step 3 the net present value (NPV) is assessed for each potential project. Step 4 is based on literature, providing a reassessment based on profitability if financing would be awarded and whether terms would meet the firm’s internal rate of return or hurdle rate. Firms pass on projects in step 5 for public approval. Step 6 represents approved projects that enter the generation mixture. A feedback is shown between the socio-political box and investors, since investors will look at the fate of similar projects in deciding which financing terms to award. 3.3 Description of Optimization The optimization in step 2 is modeled as a discrete problem, taking into account the fact that power plants have roughly representative sizes. A minimization version of the bounded knapsack problem is used to model the problem. Costs include the LCOE, the use phase human health score (in disability 6 adjusted life years (DALY)), and use phase greenhouse gas emissions. Energy return on investment was examined as well as a constraint, but was ultimately excluded since it turned out not to affect the outcomes (see appendix for discussion of this metric). Genetic algorithms were used to perform the multi-objective optimization. This approach allows a variety of solutions to be reached, reflecting the multitude of decision making processes that may be used. It is also a good approach in this type of problem where costs cannot be known with high certainty. The optimization problem used is shown in equation 1: min 𝑐 ∑ ∑ 𝑐𝑖𝑥𝑗 𝑚 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑗=1 (1) 𝑠. 𝑡. ∑ 𝑝𝑘𝑥𝑘 𝑛 𝑘=1 ≥ 𝐷 𝑆𝑘 − 𝑥𝑘 ≥ 0 𝑥𝑘 ≥ 0 In this case, c represents costs, subscript i represents the type of cost (human health, greenhouse gas emissions, or LCOE). The number of plants, x, for given technology j is shown, and overall costs are minimized. The available capacity, that is nameplate capacity discounted by capacity factor, is denoted by p. Supply, px, must meet demand. An optional constraint is included, the supply of a given technology must not exceed its limits. Here that constraint is used to help with selection of feasible solutions in the formulation. A non-negativity constraint is also used. Some adaptations were made to the problem to ensure that idiosyncrasies of the plant sizes did not bias results. A need of 10,000 MW was selected to ensure that nuclear plants, which tend to be very large, would still appear. Likewise, plant capacities were rounded so that the size would not bias the adoption. For example, if 37 MW are needed, and the technologies available are 39 and 11 MW; only the smaller would likely be used when realistically the 39 MW plant would be an option. The rounding mechanism used to determine capacity, p, is shown in equation 2: 𝑝 = { 1, 𝑐𝑎𝑣𝑔 × 𝑐𝑓 < 5 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑇𝑜𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑒(𝑐𝑎𝑣𝑔 × 𝑐𝑓, 10), 5 ≤ 𝑐𝑎𝑣𝑔 × 𝑐𝑓 < 100 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑇𝑜𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑒(𝑐𝑎𝑣𝑔 × 𝑐𝑓, 50), 𝑐𝑎𝑣𝑔 × 𝑐𝑓 > 100 (2) Where cavg is the representative nameplate capacity chosen to represent the given technology, and cf is the average capacity factor for the technology based on usage data. The result of this mechanism is that distributed solar and hydro have a p value of 1, whereas other technologies are all multiples of 10 or 50, depending on size. MATLAB’s multiobjective optimization toolbox was used, and the files are available in the github repository referenced in the supporting materials. The toolbox uses the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II). A Pareto front was stored for each run. The experiment was run 20 times in order 7 to ensure that no particular population would have an undue influence on results. Parameters are shown in table 1. Table 1: Parameters used for optimization. Full code available in github repository, see supplementary materials. Parameter Value Number of experiments 20 Population Size 150 Maximum Generations 200 Tolerance 1e-16 Representation Integer Crossover Arithmetic mean of two parents, integer Mutation Gaussian integer 3.4 Net Present Value Profitability includes the revenue side as well as costs, however. NPV is a commonly used profitability metric. NPV is calculated by adding the discounted profits over the course of the project’s lifetime (L) as incurred in each time period (t) as shown in equation 3. 𝑁𝑃𝑉 = ∑ 𝑃𝑡 (1 + 𝑑)𝑡 𝐿 𝑡=1 (3) In this case, d refers to the discount rate, which is taken as the after tax weighted average cost of capital, which is described more in the following section (2.4). P refers to the profits, which here are calculated according to equation 4: Where R is revenue, Cvar is variable costs, Cfix is fixed costs, T is taxes, and I is investment costs. A positive NPV denotes profitability and suggests that a project should be undertaken, whereas a negative NPV suggests that the project will not be profitable. 3.4.1 Revenue 3.4.1.1 Prices Revenue is the product of price and generation. Both prices and generation, however, are determined differently based on generating type and region. Since electricity prices vary during the course of the day and the course of the year, electricity prices for a sample of times over the course of the year were taken for each study area. For each technology, the maximum capacity was approximated by the highest generation for the technology (t) in the hours (h), days (d) and months (m) sampled. 𝑃𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡 − 𝐶𝑣𝑎𝑟,𝑡 − 𝐶𝑓𝑖𝑥,𝑡 − 𝑇𝑡 − 𝐼𝑡 (4) 8 𝐶𝐴𝑃𝑡 = max ℎ,𝑑,𝑚 𝑐𝑎𝑝 (5) Then, the de facto capacity factor (CFD) was calculated for each hour: A price indicator coefficient (PM) for each time period was calculated: 𝑃𝑀𝑡,ℎ,𝑑,𝑚 = 𝐶𝐹𝐷ℎ,𝑑,𝑚 × 𝑃ℎ,𝑑,𝑚 (7) Then, the weighted average price was calculated for each technology: The weighted average price for the region was also calculated. A price factor was determined for each technology by dividing the average price for the technology by the overall average price for generation in the region. While this is an approximation, for CAISO all price-taking generation types received price factors lower than 1, while opportunistic generation types received price factors greater than 1. Generators can also typically access markets for reliability (PJM capacity market), ancillary services, and may be eligible for other prices including renewable energy credits (RECS). An average capacity price from the past 15 years was assumed going forward, rising with inflation (real) for PJM’s reliability pricing model. For this work, ancillary services were not included since they typically make up a small portion of the cost of energy (see tables A-1 and A-2 in the appendix for energy costs in PJM and CAISO). REC prices are also excluded in this initial model. REC prices are not tracked, and not part of the PJM market or CAISO market. They are volatile, as REC prices are high when the supply of renewables is low and the requirements are high, so typically decline in a given geographic region over time as new capacity is added (in 2018 the prices were below $10/MWh in all PJM states (Barbose, 2018)). In PJM, solar RECs (SRECs) have experienced high prices (> $200/MWh), particularly in DC and New Jersey (Barbose, 2018). 3.4.1.2 Generation As mentioned above, revenue is the product of price and generation. For the energy market, the generation is calculated by equation 9: 𝐺𝑡 = 𝐶𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒 × 𝐶𝐹 × (1 − 𝐹𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛,𝑡) (9) 𝐶𝐹𝐷ℎ,𝑑,𝑚 = 𝑐𝑎𝑝ℎ,𝑑,𝑚 𝐶𝐴𝑃𝑡 (6) 𝑃𝑎𝑣𝑔,𝑡 = ∑ 𝑃𝑀𝑡 ∑ 𝐶𝐹𝐷𝑡 (8) 9 As indicated, the nameplate capacity and capacity factors are assumed constant over the lifetime of the asset, but a degradation factor is applied to represent the loss of performance over time. For capacity pricing, generation is considered differently since PJM uses a different formula to estimate the generation potential in the capacity market. Generating capacity is bid according to its unforced capacity (UCAP), as calculated in equation 10: 𝑈𝐶𝐴𝑃 = 𝐼𝐶𝐴𝑃 × (1 − 𝐸𝐹𝑂𝑅𝑑) (10) Installed capacity (ICAP) refers to the capacity available under peak demand conditions, and is determined by tests run at plant sites that demonstrate how much capacity is available under those conditions. EFORd refers to the outage rate for the particular generating type. Renewables are assumed to have an EFORd of 0, but their ICAP is established by a flat discount rate on their nameplate capacity according to PJM. 3.4.2 Costs 3.4.2.1 Fixed Costs Fixed costs are incurred regardless of how much the plant operates over a given year. Fixed costs are calculated by equation 11: 𝐶𝑓𝑖𝑥,𝑡 = 𝐶𝑂𝑀,𝑡 + 𝑇𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑦,𝑡 + 𝐶𝐼𝑛𝑠,𝑡 (11) Where CIns,t is the insurance cost, Tproperty,t is the property tax, and COM,t is the operations and management cost, all for t, the year studied. We assume operations and management costs escalate with inflation over time from a base. For all generating types except nuclear, the insurance cost is the product of an assumed insurance rate with the assessed value of the asset. The assessed value is the original installed cost (here approximated by the overnight cost) with the depreciation deducted. By the end of the generating lifetime (assumed at 30 years for all generation types), the asset is assumed to be fully depreciated, with an assessed value of 0. This means that the insurance cost decreases every year. Insurance costs for nuclear plants are calculated differently since their requirements are governed by the Price-Anderson Act. Their costs are estimated at $1.3 million annually per site (increasing with inflation). Property taxes vary by location. We assume a depreciation schedule for the assessed value for property tax purposes and calculate the yearly property tax (ad valorem) as the product of the installed cost, the depreciation percentage by year, and the property tax rate assumed. 3.4.2.2 Variable Costs Variable costs depend on the plant’s level of operation. Here they are calculated by equation 12: 𝐶𝑣𝑎𝑟,𝑡 = 𝐶𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙,𝑡 + 𝐶𝑔ℎ𝑔,𝑡 (12) Fuel costs, Cfuel,t are the product of the heat rate, fuel price and assumed generation of the technology in the given year. Fuel prices are assumed to rise with inflation. Greenhouse gas emissions costs are the product of generation, GHGe/MWh and the carbon price in the given area. Carbon prices are assumed 10 to rise with inflation. We omit variable operations and maintenance costs in the interest of parsimony, since they tend to be very small. 3.4.2.3 Investment Costs Overnight capital costs are used to represent installation costs. These will be financed by a combination of debt and equity. Investment costs are calculated using MATLAB’s payper function to compute the periodic payment of a loan, so an assumption is made that the loan payment will be equal for each month in the lifetime of the loan. The payper function is shown by equation 13: 𝐼𝑡 = 𝑅𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑡 (𝑂𝐶𝐶 × 𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛) 1 − (1 + 𝑅𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑡)−𝑛 (13) Where Rdebt is the interest rate assumed for debt, OCC is the overnight capital costs, Debtportion refers to the plant’s capital structure, the portion of the OCC paid by debt, and n is the number of periods (debt period in years). 3.4.3 Taxes Taxes are not necessarily either costs or revenues, since they are calculated in the US based on net income and the value of assets. Taxes that apply to generating plants in the model include federal, state and property taxes. Property taxes are considered a fixed cost, so are included above. State taxes are calculated by equation 14: 𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒,𝑡 = 𝑅𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒 × (𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑡 − (𝐼𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡,𝑡 + 𝐷𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒,𝑡)) (14) Where R refers to the tax rate, Income is the net income, Iinterest refers to the interest portion of the debt payment, and depreciation refers to the loss in depreciation for the given year. The depreciation lifetime for state taxes is assumed to be 20 years. The total annual debt payment, It, was calculated in equation 13. Its interest portion changes over time, and is calculated by the following algorithm: For each year in loan term, calculate: Interest payment = Rdebt * loan amount Principal portion = It – Interest payment Loan amount = Loan amount – Principal portion End The maximum of 0 or the calculated state tax is used. Federal tax is calculated by equation 15: 𝑇𝑓𝑒𝑑,𝑡 = 𝑅𝑓𝑒𝑑 × (𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑡 − (𝐼𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡,𝑡 + 𝐷𝑓𝑒𝑑,𝑡)) (15) The depreciation lifetime for federal taxes is assumed to be 5 years, a simplification since the recovery period ranges from 5-20 years depending on fuel source, with renewables and natural gas on the low end and nuclear and coal on the high end (Thomson Reuters). 11 3.5 Data This model has high data requirements and requires heterogeneous sources. Still, in keeping with the principle in parsimony in modeling, the data requirement has been simplified as much as possible. Data requirements are summarized in table A3 (appendix). The technologies considered in this report were taken from the Annual Technology Baseline (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2018). Where possible, figures for 2018 from the ATB were used for parameters. Some of the technologies we use are simplified from the ATB. Storage, which is included in the ATB, is not modeled here. Emissions values for air pollution were taken from (Rhodes, et al., 2017) and multiplied by ILCD characterization factors (EC European Commission and others, 2012). 3.5.1 Capacity Factor For the optimization and for CAISO NPV calculations, capacity factors used were based on the US Energy Information Administration statistics (2018) with some exceptions. For residential and commercial solar (not included in Electricity Monthly), the Kansas City capacity factor from the ATB was used. For hydropower, average figures from the types in the ATB were used. For solar thermal, the ATB 2018 figure is used since the technology that will be considered has a higher capacity factor (since storage is included) than past technologies. For the NPV calculations, a higher capacity factor for solar PV is used in CAISO based on (Bolinger & Seel, 2018). For PJM, capacity factors for 2018 were published, so these were used (Monitoring Analytics, LLC, 2019, p. 298). 3.5.2 NPV Parameters 3.5.2.1 Discount Rate 12 Table 2: Parameters required for discount rate calculations from literature (left) and as used in model, shown on the right. PJM literature values from (Energyzt Advisors, LLC, 2018). The discount rate is a contentious parameter since it determines profitability for investments. The discount factors most commonly used in NPV calculations are the firms’ weighted average costs of capital (WACC), typically in after-tax form (interest on loans is tax-deductible), so the ATWACC. The ATWACC measures the cost of a capital investment since firms finance investments by a combination of equity (selling ownership) and loans. The ATWACC is calculated by equation 16: Where E is the amount of equity used, D is the amount of debt used, r is the corresponding cost rate, and T is the tax rate. Helms et al. note that the ATWACC is really assigned by the market, and represents the market perception of the liabilities of the firm (Helms, Salm, & Wüstenhagen, 2015). It is also important to note that \"there is no way to directly measure an investor's cost of capital, especially the cost of equity\" (Goedhard, Koller, & Wessels, 2015), and therefore it is the product of subjective decisions by modelers. Still, the ATWACC will be roughly equal to the long-term return on invested capital (Goedhard, Koller, & Wessels, 2015), so can be checked against this trend. Helms et al. point out that firms frequently apply an additional percentage to the ATWACC to account for unknown risks, leading to a higher hurdle rate (Helms, Salm, & Wüstenhagen, 2015). Awerbuch pointed out that discounting should be project-specific and that it doesn’t make sense to use a company-specific ATWACC (Awerbuch, 1995). Awerbuch asserted that while firms have different costs Literature values Model PJM 2013 EnergyZT (PJM 2018) Brattle (PJM 2018) PJM CAISO Source Return on Equity 13.80% 15.00% 12.80% 11.95% 11.95% calculated Cost of Debt 7.00% 7.50% 6.50% 6.50% 6.50% assumed Capital Structure Debt Weight 60% 55% 65% 55% 55% assumed Equity Weight 40% 45% 35% 45% 45% assumed Tax Rate 40.50% 29.25% 29.25% 29.25% 30.04% current rates Risk-free Rate 3.40% 4.00% 3.50% 4% 4% 2% bond return + 2% inflation Market risk Premium 6.50% 6.90% 6.90% 5.00% 5.00% (Goedhard, Koller, & Wessels, 2015) Implied Beta 1.6 1.59 1.35 1.59 1.59 assumed Asset Beta 0.85 0.85 0.58 0.85 0.85 calculated WACC 9.70% 10.90% 8.70% 9.00% 9.00% calculated ATWACC 8.00% 9.70% 7.50% 7.90% 7.90% calculated 𝐴𝑇𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 = 𝐸 𝐸 + 𝐷 × 𝑟𝑒 + 𝐷 𝐸 + 𝐷 × 𝑟𝑑 × (1 − 𝑇) (16) 13 of capital, some costs, like fuel, are not dependent on the WACC, but are the same for everyone. Some fuels have costs which tend to fluctuate in cycles with the market, and some counter to the market, so Awerbuch recommended discounting accordingly (1995). Some costs are also known with high certainty, such as loan payment amounts, while others fluctuate with market conditions (labor). One of Awerbuch’s most convincing arguments had to do with the natural gas price which at that time fluctuated counter to market cycles, causing him to give it a very low discount rate, even 0 (1995). Since then, however, the natural gas price, while still volatile, is no longer as closely linked to oil prices (Hulshof, van der Maat, & Mulder, 2016), and in fact in the US is set primarily by competition with other gas supplies (International Gas Union, 2018). It is also not clear that oil prices maintain a negative covariance with the economy (see (Bernanke, 2016) for further discussion of this). Helms points out, however, that many firms use just one discount rate, since otherwise particular teams might always ask for a lower discount rate when lobbying for adoption of their projects (2015). Helms et al. point out that firm-wide discount rates prejudice towards higher risk-higher return projects at the expense of lower risk-lower return projects that still have an acceptable payoff (Helms, Salm, & Wüstenhagen, 2015). Nevertheless, the ATWACC is commonly used in models for electricity generation capacity, so is maintained. As seen in equation 16 above, the ATWACC depends on four principal components: the capital structure, that is the percentage of capital to be raised by equity and the percentage that comes from debt; the cost of equity; the cost of debt; and the tax rate. Of these, the easiest to pinpoint is the tax rate, because while it varies to some extent depending on the area, the rate is fixed and published. Tax rates do vary over time, however, which most models do not account for. Table 3 presents the other parameters that are used. As (Goedhard, Koller, & Wessels, 2015) notes, the cost of equity cannot be directly measured. It is usually estimated, however, using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), given in equation 17: 𝑟𝑒 = 𝑟𝑓 + 𝛽𝑖(𝐸(𝑅𝑚) − 𝑟𝑓) (17) Where rf is the risk-free rate of return in the market, βi is the unlevered asset beta, or the similarity of the risk profile of the given investment to the overall market risk profile, and the difference E(Rm) – rf is the market risk premium, since E(Rm) is the expected market return. For this work, re is estimated from the parameters given in table 3, which are also placed in context with others from the literature. We chose to use the estimates for the risk-free rate using a long term bond return of 2% (Goedhard, Koller, & Wessels, 2015) summed with the inflation rate used in the model of 2%. We assume a risk premium of 5% from (Goedhard, Koller, & Wessels, 2015). For beta values, we use the value that EnergyZT asserts has been approved in other energy filings by FERC (Energyzt Advisors, LLC, 2018). This is higher than values generally found for either utilities (0.5-0.7) or integrated oil and gas (0.7-0.8) (values from exhibit 13.9 in (Goedhard, Koller, & Wessels, 2015)), so it can be considered a smoothed beta value. The cost of debt is also known with some certainty, since bond rates are published. Still, each firm will have a bond rating, and we are assuming an average, which may not correspond to a particular project. Also, bond ratings and interest rates are dynamic. We assumed a cost of debt of 6.5%, consistent with the projection from (Newell, et al., 2018). This gives a WACC of 9% for both regions and an ATWACC of 7.9%. This is in keeping with historical ROIC rates for utilities, although higher, so represents a mixture of 14 utilities and energy services companies. Still, it is worth mentioning that there will be a range of ATWACCs by company, who may have different costs of debt and capital structures. 3.5.2.2 Generating Lifetime The economic lifetime of generating plants is another important parameter. A thirty-year lifetime is frequently used in the literature (see (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2018)). Still, in our results we offer a range of generating lifetimes since on one hand companies may be interested in payback periods and thus evaluate investments on shorter timeframes, while on the other hand the lifetime of many assets is longer than thirty years. 3.5.2.3 Other Parameters An inflation factor of 2% is used. Higher inflation rates make generation more profit, while contractions make generation less profitable. Inflation rates vary over time, and no thirty year period is seen with a constant inflation rate or one consistently between 1-3%. Electricity prices are known to be volatile due to the need to balance supply and demand. Electricity prices are also thought to be mean-reverting (Weron, 2014). For this reason electricity prices used here are based on the weighted average price for PJM and CAISO from their most recent respective reporting (Monitoring Analytics, LLC, 2019; Department of Market Monitoring, 2018). The methodology for the price factor derivations has been explained above, and documentation is available in the appendix. PJM capacity prices are published. The average price over the period 2007-2022 was used, which is projected to increase with inflation. Using a stochastic capacity price did not change results for profitability significantly. Prices for greenhouse gas permits were initially set at $17 rising with inflation based on prices in (CaliforniaCarbon.Info, 2019). 3.6 Verification To put results in context, we used the most recent data available from the EIA form 860, which records planned generation over 1 MW in the US by state and county (US Energy Information Administration, 2018). The most recent data available was from 2017, when the tax credit for wind was in place, and solar prices were higher. For CAISO, we used data from all planned generation in California. For PJM, we used the data for all the states in the territory. For states with less than 50% coverage by PJM, we included only planned generation in the counties also covered by PJM (see appendix for county lists used). We then compared this with the study results. 4 Results The results of the optimization are shown in Fig. 3. The results represent all unique best solutions (Pareto front) from twenty runs, shown in a histogram. Table A.4 contains information on each single objective for comparison purposes. A need of 10,000 MW was used since at smaller values nuclear did not appear. 15 Fig. 3: Histogram showing the total amount of available capacity installed over 20 runs of optimization model in terms of unique solutions in the Pareto set. Solar PV shows up with the highest amount of installation. Solar PV, nuclear and wind show up in over 70% of scenarios. The use of the mid-range LCOE versus overnight costs makes a big difference only for hydropower, but should be noted. Hydropower and nuclear may show up as less attractive due to 30 year generating lifetimes, when this type of plant typically has a much longer lifespan. 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500GW Installed Available Capacity Total Available Capacity by Technology 10K MW LCOE Mid LCOE Overnight 16 Fig. 1: Profitability of technologies studied in CAISO and PJM, ordered by CAISO profitability. Only Solar PV, NGCC and onshore wind are profitable in CAISO. While solar thermal and geothermal are included in this analysis, they are not viable technologies as currently implemented in the PJM markets. This analysis shows a 20, 30 and 40 year economic life for all units and does not include any REC prices. Natural gas based technologies and nuclear have the strongest profitability projections in PJM, with offshore wind least attractive. Fig. 4 shows the net present value for each technology in each of the study areas. A range of generating lifetimes is shown since many firms make decisions with a shorter payback period, and assets may be kept operational for longer than the standard timeline. All generating technologies are analyzed in both regions, but solar thermal and geothermal do not have a high potential for development in PJM due to low resource availability. Fig. 5 gives the local sensitivity analysis results. All variables were changed by 10% and the change in costs or revenues was measured in $/kw-yr as well as percentage.

Note that taxes are not included in costs or revenues here, so just a dollar value is given, and the percentages are on profitability. Installed costs are the most sensitive variable in both regions, both in terms of percentage and dollar amount. Since CAISO does not have a capacity price, it was not included in the sensitivity analysis. Likewise, since carbon prices are not in effect in PJM, the sensitivity was not studied in PJM. Model results track closely with the planned generation for California and the PJM area as of 2017, shown in Fig. 6. We found that 99.2% of the planned generation in PJM and 83% of the planned generation capacity in CAISO were profitable according to our model. The rankings were similar but not identical in the planned generation versus the model. In PJM over 85% of planned generation capacity was NGCC, whereas the majority was solar PV in California. The following technologies are profitable in PJM according to the model and plausible in terms of potential, but are not present in the planned generation: nuclear, coal-based technologies, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies.

The significantly different level of acceptance of renewables by utilities versus individuals indicates the existence of market barriers to the adoption of renewables, but few have been identified. Understanding market barriers and supports will allow renewables to be adopted more quickly if desired to avoid negative climate outcomes. This study looked in depth at the electricity markets in CAISO and PJM, two very different regions of the US, to model outcomes with least cost optimization as well as comparing profitability in the two markets of representative generation technologies. Renewables fare well in least cost optimization when 19 environmental costs are taken into account. Nevertheless, market structures in PJM seem to contribute to making natural gas based generation the most profitable capacity investment. The estimates of profitability and validity of the model are supported by analysis of the proposed generation in the two regions. Most of the rankings are also supported by the verification data. In PJM the model shows both NG CT and solar PV as more profitable than wind, which has a higher level of planned implementation in the verification data. In 2017 solar costs were higher, however, and the Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit was still in effect for wind generation, offering a significant incentive. The absences of coal-based generation and carbon capture and storage technologies from planned generation in PJM can be explained since in the framework proposed in Fig. 2, the coal-based generation options and CCS options drop out, so would not be considered in profitability analyses. Nuclear is clearly a special case, and these results suggest that nuclear power generation suffers much more from social and community acceptance barriers rather than market barriers in PJM. 5.2 Differences in Profitability between CAISO and PJM The lack of capacity market in CAISO depresses profitability as compared to PJM, and makes all generating technologies more sensitive to variability in the parameters. The low profitability of new generation in California may lead to higher energy prices, particularly due to the “duck curve” phenomenon. The duck curve refers to the need for fossil plants to ramp generation up and down to make up for the lack of solar energy availability at high demand times in the morning and at night, since insolation increases in the morning and decreases in the evening fairly quickly. Still the low profitability of generation capacity makes it easy to understand why California utilities are looking at getting out of generation (Gerdes, 2019). Also it makes it likely that California, where voters have been eager to move forward with legislated renewable guarantees, may provide an opening for innovative solutions to the problem of peak demand. Potentially this could be the site of heavy investment in storage capabilities and further subsidization of renewables. The 2017 data on proposed capacity expansion from 2017 underscores this, with a relatively high proportion of investments in plants that do not seem to be profitable in the model as compared to PJM. Commitments to 100% renewables and the risk they represent would mean that countering the duck curve cannot come from adding gas turbines, but must come from novel approaches using renewables. Even the risk of them being imposed, may make natural gas CC plants less attractive as investments. California has sought to extend CAISO to include additional territory in recent years, but the bill has never left committee. Environmental groups have been proponents of this, since the staggered timing of solar plants in the region could then more easily be utilized to alleviate the duck curve problem. A high penetration of storage might exert a downward pressure on prices, since it would no longer be necessary to match supply generated and demand in real time. PJM, on the other hand, is operating in a status quo environment. There is not enough political pressure to change the way of doing things, shown by policies like carbon pricing which are applied only in small parts of the coverage area. Meanwhile, capacity markets enhance profitability, which has led to a boom in new gas generating plants. 5.3 Capacity Markets as a Market Barrier for Renewables 20 One important implication of our findings is that capacity markets may present a market barrier to the adoption of renewables. Capacity markets exist to put a price on a particular characteristic of power generation capacity, that is, reliability. It is hypothesized and shown in a number of studies that markets cannot adequately compensate firms for the provision of reliability since in the case of blackouts, markets are no longer working, and thus there will be “missing money.” Thus, capacity markets exist to correct a perceived energy market failure. With the rise of renewables, it has become evident that the characteristic of reliability is not independent of the generation type. Reliability is provided by the energy density of fossil fuels, their high HHV and ensuing portability. As such, capacity markets are providing an additional payment to fossil generators for this quality. Capacity markets in PJM seek to provide the shortfall between energy market revenue and the fixed costs of the cheapest dispatchable technology (Bowring, 2013), which ends up offering additional support for NGCC and NG CT. For renewables to offer the same level of reliability, an additional block, storage, must be added to the matrix. This is currently expensive, which is why it is not modeled here. But storage has another important characteristic—were it to be added to grids at levels needed for managing a very high renewable generating mixture, or to store peak load for an entire ISO or RTO, price volatility would be significantly dampened. Since currently some plants rely on high peak prices for profitability, this might be expected to have a large impact particularly on how peak demand is handled. There is another important implication in policy terms. Looking at the cost of energy in the two markets, as shown in tables A1 and A2 of the appendix, we see that capacity prices raise the cost of energy. Were carbon prices to be added, the cost of generation for fossil plants would rise, driving up capacity prices, adding more to the cost of energy. In this context, we are incentivizing the use of fossil resources on one hand by allowing a market for their intrinsic benefit of dispatchability, but then penalizing them with the other hand for another intrinsic characteristic, the negative externalities of combustion based processes and climate change potential. This means that carbon prices may not be a logical policy mechanism here. At the time of writing, there is a deadlock between PJM and FERC regarding rules for their capacity market. The FERC is concerned about the inclusion of subsidized energy sources in the market distorting prices (Bade, 2019). Still, we can see from this work that the presence of capacity markets already bolsters conventional sources of electricity, and does not provide an equal level of support to renewables. This allows windfall benefits due to the intrinsic availability of energy at any time from fossil resources. While these favorable conditions hold, investment in fossil plants in PJM seems like a very good bet, since even using a generating lifetime of 20 years, NGCC is more profitable than any of the other technologies, assuming that it continues to earn capacity payments at a fairly predictable rate. While capacity markets serve to provide a specific service (reliability) due to a known market shortcoming, high reserve margins of 20+ % for those events mean that capacity prices are propping up the addition of plants whose value as capacity additions is debatable since their electricity may be seldom used, particularly if their marginal costs are higher than average. On the other hand, reliability is important. Also, if plants are not used, their potential GHG emissions will not be realized. Grid reliability comes in two forms. The initial reliability is the presence of a reliable system, free from corruption, with all necessary infrastructure to ensure the availability of the basic service of power generation. This is arguably a distinct service from the peak availability, because there are a variety of different ways to meet the generation at peak times. In fact, the principal reason for peaks is because of 21 heavy use of climate regulating end-uses. The lack of dynamic demand pricing to consumers then drives up usage as well since people do not try to reduce other uses as wholesale electricity prices rise. In fact, if electrification of heating were to take place on a large scale, the winter peak would intensify. Some market for demand side reductions does exist. This incentivizes utilities to offer consumers discounts on their bills if they allow their air conditioners to be de-activated in the hottest hours of the summer, for example. Still, more extensive demand-side innovation is not incentivized. For example, the use of smarter design, incorporating passive solar heating or cooling, cannot participate in such a market. The lack of dynamic demand pricing means that even consumers who are willing to make more complete interruptions of power usage do not generally receive any incentive for this. Instead, in PJM, money is added to the cost of energy, which consumers will ultimately pay, to increase reliability, which means dispatchable power generation supply, which is tilted towards fossil resources. 5.4 Solar Photovoltaic versus Natural Gas Solar PV is the lowest cost technology, but once cost is combined with revenue, the picture is less favorable. In both regions, we predict that solar PV receives lower than average prices. In CAISO this is partially due to the high adoption of solar. In PJM it is due to a price peak in January when little solar power was available, so a low ability to take advantage of prices when high. The lack of opportunism will continue to hamper the attractiveness of solar generation without storage. Still, the directed policy of solar RECS has led to high prices in certain market segments that gives solar PV a very high upside in those regions. REC prices were not considered in the model, but they are expected to provide a strong incentive where they exist. Therefore, the adoption of solar PV in PJM will likely be guided mostly by the presence of renewable portfolio standards. Wind’s profitability in PJM is negatively affected by its low qualification for capacity auctions. This is especially seen in the deeply unfavorable profile of offshore wind in PJM markets. NGCC seems much more profitable than solar PV in PJM due to the ability for opportunism as well as its better position in capacity markets. NG CT makes up a higher proportion of planned generation in CAISO than in PJM. PJM seems to have a “winner takes all” market for natural gas combined cycle generation. One theory that could explain this discrepancy is that NG CT can retain its level of profitability with a very low assumed capacity factor. Our model assumes the capacity factor of 8% in CAISO and 6.9% in PJM. This means that in CAISO, where renewable mandates have been increasing consistently, NG CT seems to be a better bet than NGCC, which needs to run at a higher capacity factor to be profitable. In PJM, there seems to be little risk of NGCC being forced out of the electricity market, so generators can be installed without fear. Also, the higher profit margins due to capacity markets, even at low generating lifetimes, make them a safer investment. 5.5 Limitations Analysis reveals a high sensitivity to many variables that cannot be known with high certainty, including some such as price that are volatile. This suggests that policy options should be explored using scenarios that allow the range of values to give a more accurate sense of possibilities. In addition, some variables, like REC prices, are difficult to include accurately. Installed costs are an important variable, and likely have a high variability since location plays an important part. Also, even though capacity markets are not 22 present in CAISO and accordingly we see a lower cost of energy (see table A2), private reliability contracts are made, but the terms are not public, so they were not included here. It is possible that NG CT benefits from these contracts. While the findings here point to a large influence of capacity payments for profitability, PJM estimates that the cost of energy is primarily from energy prices, with reliability capacity making up roughly 20% of energy costs between 2014-2018 (calculations from data in (Monitoring Analytics, LLC, 2019)). The number is just over 20% if only energy and reliability costs are included. Still this contrasts with CAISO which showed a lower cost of energy in every year, and for which reliability makes up a negligible proportion of total costs (<1%) (Department of Market Monitoring, 2018). 6 Summary and Policy Implications The desire to bolster excess capacity as in PJM is a choice reflecting social and political assumptions that assume people place a high value on reliability that is not generally directly measured and cannot be shown directly by market outcomes. Likewise, the desire to bolster renewables in California reflects a contrasting set of social and political assumptions. One major difference between these two policy initiatives is that those in California resulted from policy referenda and thus result directly from voting and the democratic process. In PJM the capacity market and its reforms come from technocratic processes and are not decided on by any direct intervention from the public. This means that people’s desire to bolster renewable energy may be superseded by pseudo-administrative practices. To place things in more neutral language, Spence states that “the vision of greener energy markets, on the other hand, is mostly a top-down vision pushed along by policy, mostly at the state level (Spence, 2017).” Thus, the incentives towards renewables are being pushed in via policy, but arguably so are the incentives in place with capacity markets, which provide an additional payment stream for some types of power generation. As such, capacity markets seem to present a market barrier for renewables. Since capacity markets have been adopted throughout most of the US, the question remains as to whether additional markets should be added to value benefits that renewables are supposed to bring to the table, such as lower pollution, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, early adoption of technology, and a hedge against volatile or high fuel prices. In a sense, RECs do this, but they are not universally adopted. Recently, many companies have announced contracts with renewable energy companies to achieve targets for renewables in their own energy mix (see for example (Reed, 2019)). This is unsurprising given our results, because solar PV and wind offer low cost as well as risk reductions, but the revenue structure in PJM gives an advantage to fossil resources due to their ability to serve as flexible peak demand. Storage associated with renewables could provide the same need, as could adaptive energy use by industry, which individual contracts allow them to provide. Profitability metrics account for a large portion of capacity adoption decisions. Still, they don’t totally predict adoptions, since in PJM technologies that appear to be profitable were not adopted, and in both regions unprofitable technologies such as batteries, geothermal and biomass (California), and offshore wind (PJM) were also proposed. Combining the initial cost analysis with the profitability analysis gives better results in PJM, disqualifying coal and CCS in the initial step. More work using portfolio approaches and including the option value for these technologies is also needed to better approach market 23 outcomes, particularly in CAISO where profit margins appear slimmer. More transparency in California’s reliability contracts would also be helpful for verification purposes. High sensitivity to many model variables highlights the need for scenario based approaches to understanding policy implications. This study shows that nuclear energy projects probably face social and community acceptance barriers more than market barriers.
