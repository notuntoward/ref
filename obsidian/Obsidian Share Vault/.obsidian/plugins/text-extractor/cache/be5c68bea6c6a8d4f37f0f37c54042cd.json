Everything you need to know GEORGE LAWTON, CONTRIBUTOR Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. The recent buzz around generative AI has been driven by the simplicity of new user interfaces for creating high- quality text, graphics and videos in a matter of seconds. The technology, it should be noted, is not brand-new. Generative AI was introduced in the 1960s in chatbots. But it was not until 2014, with the introduction of generative adversarial networks, or GANs -- a type of machine learning algorithm -- that generative AI could create convincingly authentic images, videos and audio of real people. On the one hand, this newfound capability has opened up opportunities that include better movie dubbing and rich educational content. It also unlocked concerns about deepfakes -- digitally forged images or videos -- and harmful cybersecurity attacks on businesses, including nefarious requests that realistically mimic an employee's boss. Two additional recent advances that will be discussed in more detail below have played a critical part in generative AI going mainstream: transformers and the breakthrough language models they enabled. Transformers are a type of machine learning that made it possible for 3 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI? EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW MAY 2023 In this guide: How does generative AI work?

What are some examples of generative AI tools? Generative AI vs. AI Generative AI history Best practices for using generative AI The future of generative AI Generative AI FAQs Latest generative AI news and trends researchers to train ever-larger models without having to label all of the data in advance. New models could thus be trained on billions of pages of text, resulting in answers with more depth. In addition, transformers unlocked a new notion called attention that enabled models to track the connections between words across pages, chapters and books rather than just in individual sentences. And not just words: Transformers could also use their ability to track connections to analyze code, proteins, chemicals and DNA. The rapid advances in so-called large language models (LLMs) -- i.e., models with billions or even trillions of parameters -- have opened a new era in which generative AI models can write engaging text, paint photorealistic images and even create somewhat entertaining sitcoms on the fly. Moreover, innovations in multimodal AI enable teams to generate content across multiple types of media, including text, graphics and video. This is the basis for tools like Dall-E that automatically create images from a text description or generate text captions from images. These breakthroughs notwithstanding, we are still in the early days of using generative AI to create readable text and photorealistic stylized graphics. Early implementations have had issues with accuracy and bias, as well as being prone to hallucinations and spitting back weird answers. Still, progress thus far indicates that the inherent capabilities of this type of AI could fundamentally change business. Going forward, this technology could help write 4 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?

HOW DOES GENERATIVE AI WORK? Generative AI starts with a prompt that could be in the form of a text, an image, a video, a design, musical notes, or any input that the AI system can process. Various AI algorithms then return new content in response to the prompt. Content can include essays, solutions to problems, or realistic fakes created from pictures or audio of a person. Early versions of generative AI required submitting data via an API or an otherwise complicated process. Developers had to familiarize themselves with special tools and write applications using languages such as Python. Now, pioneers in generative AI are developing better user experiences that let you describe a request in plain language. After an initial response, you can also customize the results with feedback about the style, tone and other elements you want the generated content to reflect. 5 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?

Generative AI vs. AI Generative AI history Best practices for using generative AI The future of generative AI Generative AI FAQs Latest generative AI news and trends Similarly, images are transformed into various visual elements, also expressed as vectors. One caution is that these techniques can also encode the biases, racism, deception and puffery contained in the training data. Once developers settle on a way to represent the world, they apply a particular neural network to generate new content in response to a query or prompt. Techniques such as GANs and variational autoencoders (VAEs) -- neural networks with a decoder and encoder -- are suitable for generating realistic human faces, synthetic data for AI training or even facsimiles of particular humans. Recent progress in transformers such as Google's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), OpenAI's GPT and Google AlphaFold have also resulted in neural networks that can not only encode language, images and proteins but also generate new content. WHAT ARE DALL-E, CHATGPT AND BARD? ChatGPT, Dall-E and Bard are popular generative AI interfaces. Dall-E. Trained on a large data set of images and their associated text descriptions, Dall-E is an example of a multimodal AI application that identifies connections across multiple media, such as vision, text and audio. In this case, it connects the meaning of words to visual elements. It was built using OpenAI's GPT implementation in 2021. Dall-E 2, a second, more 8 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?

Generative AI vs. AI Generative AI history Best practices for using generative AI The future of generative AI Generative AI FAQs Latest generative AI news and trends How neural networks are transforming generative AI Researchers have been creating AI and other tools for programmatically generating content since the early days of AI. The earliest approaches, known as rules-based systems and later as \"expert systems,\" used explicitly crafted rules for generating responses or data sets. Neural networks, which form the basis of much of the AI and machine learning applications today, flipped the problem around. Designed to mimic how the human brain works, neural networks \"learn\" the rules from finding patterns in existing data sets. Developed in the 1950s and 1960s, the first neural networks were limited by a lack of computational power and small data sets. It was not until the advent of big data in the mid-2000s and improvements in computer hardware that neural networks became practical for generating content. The field accelerated when researchers found a way to get neural networks to run in parallel across the graphics processing units (GPUs) that were being used in the computer gaming industry to render video games. New machine learning techniques developed in the past decade, including the aforementioned generative adversarial networks and transformers, have set the stage for the recent remarkable advances in AI-generated content. 9 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?

It enables users to generate imagery in multiple styles driven by user prompts. ChatGPT. The AI-powered chatbot that took the world by storm in November 2022 was built on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 implementation. OpenAI has provided a way to interact and fine-tune text responses via a chat interface with interactive feedback. Earlier versions of GPT were only accessible via an API. GPT-4 was released March 14, 2023. ChatGPT incorporates the history of its conversation with a user into its results, simulating a real conversation. After the incredible popularity of the new GPT interface, Microsoft announced a significant new investment into OpenAI and integrated a version of GPT into its Bing search engine. Bard. Google was another early leader in pioneering transformer AI techniques for processing language, proteins and other types of content. It open sourced some of these models for researchers. However, it never released a public interface for these models. Microsoft's decision to implement GPT into Bing drove Google to rush a public-facing chatbot, Google Bard, to market. Google suffered a significant loss in stock price following Bard's rushed debut after the language model incorrectly said the Webb telescope was the first to discover a planet in a foreign solar system. Meanwhile, Microsoft and ChatGPT implementations have also lost face in their early outings due to inaccurate results and erratic behavior. 10 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?

USE CASES FOR GENERATIVE AI, BY INDUSTRY New generative AI technologies have sometimes been described as general-purpose technologies akin to steam power, electricity and computing because they can profoundly affect many industries and use cases. It's essential to keep in mind that, like previous general-purpose technologies, it often took decades for people to find the best way to organize workflows to take advantage of the new approach rather than speeding up small portions of existing workflows. Here are some ways generative AI applications could impact different industries: 12 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI? EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW MAY 2023 In this guide: How does generative AI work?

WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS OF GENERATIVE AI? Early implementations of generative AI vividly illustrate its many limitations. Some of the challenges generative AI presents result from the specific approaches used to implement particular use cases. For example, a summary of a complex topic is easier to read than an explanation that includes various sources supporting key points. The readability of the summary, however, comes at the expense of a user being able to vet where the information comes from. Here are some of the limitations to consider when implementing or using a generative AI app: • It does not always identify the source of content. • It can be challenging to assess the bias of original sources. • Realistic-sounding content makes it harder to identify inaccurate information. • It can be difficult to understand how to tune for new circumstances. • Results can gloss over bias, prejudice and hatred. 14 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?

Generative AI vs. AI Generative AI history Best practices for using generative AI The future of generative AI Generative AI FAQs Latest generative AI news and trends Attention is all you need: Transformers bring new capability In 2017, Google reported on a new type of neural network architecture that brought significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy to tasks like natural language processing. The breakthrough approach, called transformers, was based on the concept of attention. At a high level, attention refers to the mathematical description of how things (e.g., words) relate to, complement and modify each other. The researchers described the architecture in their seminal paper, \"Attention is all you need,\" showing how a transformer neural network was able to translate between English and French with more accuracy and in only a quarter of the training time than other neural nets. The breakthrough technique could also discover relationships, or hidden orders, between other things buried in the data that humans might have been unaware of because they were too complicated to express or discern. Transformer architecture has evolved rapidly since it was introduced, giving rise to LLMs such as GPT-3 and better pre-training techniques, such as Google's BERT. WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS SURROUNDING GENERATIVE AI? The rise of generative AI is also fueling various concerns. These relate to the quality of results, potential for misuse and abuse, and the potential to disrupt existing business 15 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?

Generative AI vs. AI Generative AI history Best practices for using generative AI The future of generative AI Generative AI FAQs Latest generative AI news and trends ETHICS AND BIAS IN GENERATIVE AI Despite their promise, the new generative AI tools open a can of worms regarding accuracy, trustworthiness, bias, hallucination and plagiarism -- ethical issues that likely will take years to sort out. None of the issues are particularly new to AI. Microsoft's first foray into chatbots in 2016, called Tay, for example, had to be turned off after it started spewing inflammatory rhetoric on Twitter. What is new is that the latest crop of generative AI apps sounds more coherent on the surface. But this combination of humanlike language and coherence is not synonymous with human intelligence, and there currently is great debate about whether generative AI models can be trained to have reasoning ability. One Google engineer was even fired after publicly declaring the company's generative AI app, Language Models for Dialog Applications (LaMDA), was sentient. The convincing realism of generative AI content introduces a new set of AI risks. It makes it harder to detect AI-generated content and, more importantly, makes it more difficult to detect when things are wrong. This can be a big problem when we rely on generative AI results to write code or provide medical advice. Many results of generative AI are not transparent, so it is hard to determine if, for example, they infringe on copyrights or if there is problem with the original sources from which they draw results. If you don't know how the AI came to a conclusion, you cannot reason about why it might be wrong. 18 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?

AI Generative AI produces new content, chat responses, designs, synthetic data or deepfakes. Traditional AI, on the other hand, has focused on detecting patterns, making decisions, honing analytics, classifying data and detecting fraud. Generative AI, as noted above, often uses neural network techniques such as transformers, GANs and VAEs. Other kinds of AI, in distinction, use techniques including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and reinforcement learning. Generative AI often starts with a prompt that lets a user or data source submit a starting query or data set to guide content generation. This can be an iterative process to explore content variations. Traditional AI algorithms process new data to return a simple result. 19 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?

Ian Goodfellow introduced GANs in 2014. This deep learning technique provided a novel approach for organizing competing neural networks to generate and then rate content variations. These could generate realistic people, voices, music and text. This inspired interest in -- and fear of -- how generative AI could be used to create realistic deepfakes that impersonate voices and people in videos. Since then, progress in other neural network techniques and architectures has helped expand generative AI capabilities. Techniques include VAEs, long short-term memory, transformers, diffusion models and neural radiance fields. 21 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?

Some AI proponents believe that generative AI is an essential step toward general-purpose AI and even consciousness. One early tester of Google's LaMDA chatbot even created a stir when he publicly declared it was sentient. Then he was let go from the company. In 1993, the American science fiction writer and computer scientist Vernor Vinge posited that in 30 years, we would have the technological ability to create a \"superhuman intelligence\" -- an AI that is more intelligent than humans -- after which the human era would end. AI pioneer Ray Kurzweil predicted such a \"singularity\" by 2045. 30 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI? EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW MAY 2023 In this guide: How does generative AI work?

Robot pioneer Rodney Brooks predicted that AI will not gain the sentience of a 6-year-old in his lifetime but could seem as intelligent and attentive as a dog by 2048. LATEST GENERATIVE AI NEWS AND TRENDS The need for AI containment and regulation were top of mind in recent news. Geoffrey Hinton, a leading figure in the field of AI, resigned from Google in early May and expressed fears about the negative potential of AI at a conference at MIT. Hinton said he believes there must be more research into AI safety and ethics to ensure that it is developed and used responsibly. Hinton's fears came amid growing concerns about the risks of AI and increased agreement on the need for government intervention. The U.S. and U.K. governments have taken steps to address these concerns. The U.S. announced measures to address the risk of an AI arms race, including new regulations to govern the export of AI technology and the creation of a task force to address ethical and security concerns surrounding AI development. The initiative involves a probe into AI backed by tech firms including Nvidia, Microsoft and Google. Meanwhile, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a review of competition in foundational AI to assess whether the current state is sufficient to promote innovation and benefit consumers. 31 WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?

Generative AI vs. AI Generative AI history Best practices for using generative AI The future of generative AI Generative AI FAQs Latest generative AI news and trends Concerns about the power of big tech companies and possible negative effects of AI are prompting the public to ask for government intervention. A survey of U.S. voters found that 54% believe the government should act quickly to regulate AI. Although the recent effort to pause AI was initially met with skepticism by leaders in the U.S., shifting public opinion is pressuring governments to help to ensure that AI is used to benefit society.
