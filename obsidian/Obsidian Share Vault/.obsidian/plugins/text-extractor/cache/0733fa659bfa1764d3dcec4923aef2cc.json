A couple of draft chapters had been presented at inter- national conferences in 2018 and 2019. Nonetheless, the underlying idea of this book had been conceived some years before. In the mid-2010s, Western European party systems were showing clear signs of marked turbulence: after decades of an almost uninterrupted patent stability, the general elections of that period were characterized by unprecedented levels of electoral change. Voters seemed prone to change their voting behavior between two consecutive elections like never before. Moreover, electoral volatility levels were surging to record ﬁgures in each coun- try’s history. Some parties that had contributed to creating their party system were undergoing unexpected electoral setbacks and an army of new parties was gaining prominence, and in some cases also obtaining successful electoral results. The change produced in the electoral arena was moving to the parliamentary one and, subsequently, to the govern- mental one, either generating frequent political crises because of parties’ inability to form governing coalitions able to receive the necessary parlia- mentary support or, conversely, giving birth to innovative governments supported by hitherto unseen party coalitions or even characterized by the presence of parties that had never been in government before. The most interesting aspect of all these changes was the fact that such phenomena were not one-off instances but tended to recur again and again in consec- utive elections and legislatures in different countries. Before our eyes, the v vi PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Western European party systems consolidated after the end of World War II were changing for good. From our privileged observatory, the Florentine seat of the CISE (Italian Center for Electoral Studies), we started collecting data on elec- toral volatility and on how much of this volatility that was due to the exit of old parties and the emergence of new ones. Then, we extended the analysis to the other arenas of party competition, by studying how volatility was moving from ballot boxes to parliaments, and then to governments. The results were astonishing. We started writing about these phenomena and published together the ﬁrst articles, some of which provided the preliminary ground for this work. We soon realized that there was something bigger than the simple party system change—a topic discussed, sometimes with clear exaggerations, since the end of the 1970s. This time, the change was a more structural one and was reaching the foundations of Western European party systems, with potential conse- quences on party accountability and responsiveness, but also, more gener- ally speaking, on the quality of democracy. Therefore, it was necessary to get back to the concept of institutionalization discussed by Huntington and apply it to party systems. Such work had been already tackled by other scholars in different regions (Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe), characterized by unstable party systems and democracies that were far from being consolidated. Conversely, it had not received a sufﬁcient level of attention in Western Europe, a region that had been always considered as the paradigm of stable party systems and consoli- dated democracy. So, it was necessary to build a theoretical and empirical framework able to deﬁne and measure the dimensions of institutional- ization in the different arenas where party competition takes place and, subsequently, verify the presence of a de-institutionalization process, its determinants, and its consequences on democracy by means of a compre- hensive dataset collecting data on all general elections, legislatures, and cabinets in Western European countries after World War II. The idea behind this book was born, and it took us some years to make it happen. Clearly, there are some people to thank. First, we thank all panel chairs and discussants of the conferences where we presented some prelim- inary drafts of our work. Preliminary versions of book chapters were presented at the conference ‘Political parties in comparative perspec- tive’ held at the Georgetown University and the New York University, Florence, March 22–23, 2018; at the 114th annual conference of the PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS vii American Political Science Association, Boston, August 30–September 2, 2018; at the 12th ECPR General Conference, Hamburg, August 22– 25, 2018; at the CISE Luiss Seminar, Rome, December 6, 2018; at the 26th International Conference of Europeanists, Carlos III University, Madrid, June 20–22, 2019; at the 115th APSA Conference, Washington DC, August 29–September 1, 2019; and at the XXXIII SISP Confer- ence, Lecce, September 12–14, 2019.

We have already noted that this book was born from the discus- sions held at the Florentine seat of the CISE and was enriched from the constant debates with the other researchers of the CISE. We there- fore wholeheartedly thank the CISE founder Roberto D’Alimonte, the CISE director Lorenzo De Sio and the CISE researchers and collabo- rators, including Aldo Paparo, Nicola Maggini, Davide Angelucci, Luca Carrieri, Davide Vittori, and Federico Trastulli.

institutionalization has dealt mainly with its causes, less attention has been devoted to an analysis of its consequences on democracy. From this viewpoint, Mainwaring and Scully (1995), who analyzed the third wave of democratization in Latin Amer- ican countries, demonstrated that party system institutionalization is a necessary condition for the consolidation of democracy. Conversely, a recent work by Casal Bértoa (2017) found that a highly institutional- ized party system is a sufﬁcient condition for the survival of democracy. Moreover, other studies have shown how an under-institutionalized party system may also affect the functioning of speciﬁc aspects or processes of democracy, such as voters’ turnout (Robbins & Hunter, 2012), govern- ment formation (Savage, 2016), the rise to power of anti-party politicians (Mainwaring & Torcal, 2006), government spending (Robbins, 2010), the extent to which parties are distinguishable in terms of values and policies (Scherlis, 2008), and incentives for politicians to curb corruption (Schleiter & Voznaya, 2018). However, all these ﬁndings have been retrieved from regions of the world like Latin America or Central and Eastern Europe, where party systems have generally been considered unstable, and democracies are far from consolidated, to say the least. This is why we still lack an in-depth © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022 A. Chiaramonte and V.

EMANUELE analysis of the effects of party system deinstitutionalization on democ- racy per se, in the context of long-standing consolidated democracies and formerly stable party systems like those of Western Europe. This is precisely what we do in this chapter. Speciﬁcally, we investigate whether and to what extent the recent wave of party system deinstitutionalization has been affecting both ‘subjective’ democracy (i.e., democracy as citizens perceive it) and ‘objective’ democracy (i.e., democracy as it corresponds to its deﬁning components) (Bollen & Paxton, 2000; Fuchs & Roller, 2018) in Western European countries; that is, in countries whose citizens were born into democracy, and where democratic ideals have not been disputed since. The results of our analysis offer a rather positive answer to our research question. Indeed, party system institutionalization in Western Europe positively affects both components of democracy. In other words, higher levels of party system institutionalization increase citizens’ satisfaction toward the way democracy is perceived to work, and an improvement in the set of rules, procedures, and outcomes that deﬁne the extent to which a country can be considered democratic. This is not exactly good news for Western Europe, as the region is undergoing a decline in party system institutionalization. Should this process continue over the next few years, it would have a detrimental impact on both components of democracy, by stirring dissatisfaction among citizens, and rendering rules, procedures, and outcomes—the very foundations of democracy—more fragile than ever. The chapter is organized as follows: the next section presents the two hypotheses related to the expected impact of party system institu- tionalization on democracy, and then it discusses the two measures of democracy we will take into account in the empirical analysis; the third section discusses the control variables and the method employed in the empirical analysis; ﬁnally, the fourth section presents the empirical results. A conclusion follows. 8.1 The Effect of PSI on ‘Subjective’ and ‘Objective’ Democracy: Hypotheses The degree of party system institutionalization matters for democracy. As recalled in the introductory section of this chapter, looking at the Latin American countries, Mainwaring and Scully (1995) have demon- strated that weakly institutionalized party systems endanger democratic 8 THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTY SYSTEM … 195 consolidation, while highly institutionalized party systems foster it. Other scholars have also shown that PSI may also affect the functioning of speciﬁc aspects or processes of democracy, ranging from voter turnout (Robbins & Hunter, 2012) to the rise to power of anti-party politicians (Mainwaring & Torcal, 2006), especially in areas where democracy is weakly consolidated. Here, we want to advance research on the impact of PSI on democ- racy in two regards. First, we analyze the effects of PSI in the context of long-standing consolidated democracies. Second, we focus on the effects of PSI not on certain peculiar aspects of democracy, but on democracy itself. As a result of this latter point, we need to address the question of how to operationalize and measure democracy. This question has a long history of more or less successful efforts. We are not going to review it here. For the sake of the present analysis, it may sufﬁce to recall that recent research suggests combining or complementing ‘objective’ measures of democracy—i.e. democracy as it corresponds to its deﬁning components—and/with ‘subjective’ measures of democracy—i.e. democ- racy as citizens perceive it (Bollen & Paxton, 2000; Fuchs & Roller, 2018). We will follow this approach and, consequently, our research hypotheses are: Hp1 the more institutionalized the party system, the higher the level of ‘subjective’ perceived democracy; Hp2 the more institutionalized the party system, the higher the level of ‘objective’ democracy. As anticipated before, to address our hypotheses regarding the effect of PSI on, respectively, ‘subjective’ (Hp1) and ‘objective’ (Hp2) measures of democracy, we need to ﬁnd measures for both. Measuring the level of democracy requires an accurate operationalization. In this regard, it is safer to turn to well-known indicators taken from widely used sources to avoid the risk of providing unreliable or non-valid measures (Adcock & Collier, 2001;Drost, 2011). Our ‘subjective’ measure of democracy is drawn from the question on ‘Satisfaction with national democracy’ in the Eurobarometer (Farrer & Zingher, 2019). This latter is a well-known series of individual-level surveys conducted in all European Union countries twice a year and consisting of approximately 1000 face-to-face interviews per country. It is probably the most important source of cross-national individual-level 196 A. CHIARAMONTE AND V. EMANUELE survey data in Europe and the one that provides the largest temporal variation of European citizens’ perceptions and attitudes, as its surveys date back to 1973. Speciﬁcally, the above-mentioned question we are interested in asks respondents how satisﬁed they are with the way democ- racy works in their respective country.1 By collecting the aggregate share of respondents that declare themselves very or fairly satisﬁed, we obtain a cross-country and cross-time comparable measure of satisfaction with democracy in a given country at a given point in time.2 Therefore, Satisfaction with democracy captures the extent to which citizens are satisﬁed with democracy, not their general support for democ- racy as the best form of government.3 The latter question is not asked in the Eurobarometer surveys. However, we argue that—especially in a context of long-term consolidated democratic environment as it is the case in Western Europe—the crucial aspect to be tested is not the general predisposition of citizens toward the democratic regime. This is some- thing we can take for granted to a considerable extent.4 Conversely, we are much more interested in understanding whether the level of institu- tionalization of a given party system is linked to citizens’ perceptions of the functioning of the democratic game.5 1 The exact question is the following: ‘On the whole, are you very satisﬁed, fairly satisﬁed, not very satisﬁed or not at all satisﬁed with the way democracy works in (your country)?’ The answer options are very satisﬁed, fairly satisﬁed, not very satisﬁed, not at all satisﬁed, and do not know. 2 When two waves of the Eurobarometer survey with information on Satisfaction with democracy were available in a given year, we simply reported the mean of the two in terms of share of respondents that declare to be very or fairly satisﬁed with the way democracy works in their country. We think this operation is more reliable than that of arbitrarily choosing either the ﬁrst or the second wave. 3 On the difference between satisfaction with democracy and support for democracy, see Auerbach and Petrova (2019). 4 After the Great Recession, support for democracy remains high in Western Europe, particularly in bail-out countries. See Cordero and Simón (2016). 5 In their study across 31 countries from both Western and Eastern Europe, Nemˇcok and Wass (2020) include the index of closure (Casal Bértoa & Enyedi, 2016)—which is very similar to our PSI index in the governmental arena—to test how it moderates the effect of their main independent variable, the winners (i.e., voters of parties in govern- ment) vs. losers status (i.e., voters of parties in opposition), on voters’ satisfaction with democracy. They found that the more predictable the system, the higher the gap in satis- faction with democracy between winners and losers. However, they did not test the direct impact of party system institutionalization on satisfaction with democracy, which is one of the tasks of this chapter. 8 THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTY SYSTEM … 197 The measure provides data for 18 Western European countries. Compared to our measure of PSI, it has no information for Iceland nor for Switzerland. Moreover, as far as temporal variations are concerned, it draws from data going back to 1973 for nine countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), back to 1980 for Greece, back to 1985 for Portugal and Spain, back to 1993 for Finland, back to 1999 for Austria and Sweden, back to 2004 for Cyprus and Malta, and eventually only for the period spanning 1990–1994 for Norway. Our ‘objective’ measure of democracy is taken from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) dataset (Coppedge et al., 2020). V-Dem covers all sovereign and semi-sovereign states at least from 1900 onwards, providing scholars with a wealth of indicators able to take into account the multi- dimensional nature of democracy and its spatial and temporal variation. These indicators come from three different data collection methods. Indeed, they rely on: ‘(1) factual data gathered from other dataset or orig- inal sources; (2) evaluative indicators coded by multiple country experts; and (3) aggregated variables’ (Lindberg et al., 2014, 161). Therefore, the data collection combines true ‘objective’ measures with expert judgments (with a total of two thousand experts involved). Among the many possible indicators of democracy offered by the V- Dem dataset, we take into consideration the Electoral democracy index.It ‘embodies the core value of making rulers responsive to citizens through competition for the approval of a broad electorate during periodic elec- tions’ (Lindberg et al., 2014, 160). It is considered a necessary requisite of democracy and an essential element of any other conception of repre- sentative democracy. This is because all the indicators V-Dem provides to operationalize the other components of democracy (liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian components) include an overlapping element, namely the electoral component of democracy. From an empirical viewpoint, the Electoral democracy index combines several indicators concerning elections (presence of elected ofﬁcials6;the extent to which elections are free and fair; share of the population with suffrage), freedom of expression, freedom of association, and access to 6 Chief executive and legislature directly or indirectly appointed through popular elections. 198 A. CHIARAMONTE AND V. EMANUELE alternative sources of information. Altogether, the Electoral democracy index ‘is therefore very similar to Robert Dahl’s concept of polyarchy’ (Lindberg et al., 2014, 161). The index ranges between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate a higher level of democracy. Data on the Electoral democracy index have been available for all Western European countries since 1945, thus covering all observations for which we have data on PSI. 8.2 Controls, Data, and Method In order to test Hp1 and Hp2, our ‘subjective and ‘objective’ measures of democracy will be regressed (in separate models) on our key variable of interest, namely PSI. In addition, we will also add some control variables that are expected to inﬂuence democracy in a given country (see also Farrer & Zingher, 2019; Reher, 2015; Singh, 2018). To begin with, we start from two controls involving the relation- ship between societal and political actors, corruption and clientelism. Corruption is expected to erode the bond between citizens and the demo- cratic process (Rose et al., 1998; Singh, 2018). Clientelism, despite being considered an anchor in the process of democratic consolidation in coun- tries where the political system has low legitimacy (such as Southern European countries in the process of transition from authoritarian regimes in the 1970s, see Morlino, 1998), is expected to be negatively associated with democratic quality (Farrer & Zingher, 2019). We will measure the level of corruption in a country using the Political corruption index 7 and the level of clientelism using the Clientelism Index 8 both taken from the V-Dem dataset. Second, national economic performance is also expected to be asso- ciated with citizens’ perceptions toward the functioning of democracy. Since Lipset’s classic study (1960), the economic development of a country has been seen as a precondition for democracy, and, therefore, 7 The index combines distinct types of corruption, from the public sector to the execu- tive, from the legislative to the judicial sectors. We prefer this measure to the Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index as this latter has only been available since 1995, while our measure based on V-Dem has been available since 1945, thus allowing for longer cross-time comparability. 8 The index refers to the targeted, contingent distribution of resources (e.g., goods, services, jobs, money) in exchange for political support. It considers indicators for vote- buying, particularistic vs public goods, and whether party linkages are programmatic or clientelistic (Coppedge et al., 2020). 8 THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTY SYSTEM … 199 satisfaction with democracy is expected to be higher in countries where the population is, on average, wealthier (but see also Przeworski et al., 1999). As a measure of the national economic development, we use the GDP per capita measured in US dollars in the previous year (Bernauer & Vatter, 2012; Reher, 2015; Singh, 2018). Data are taken from the OECD (2019). Third, the level of cultural fractionalization of a society, namely the degree to which a country is ethnically, linguistically, or religiously divided, needs to be examined. Although the presence of a homoge- neous civic culture (Almond & Verba, 1963) and a set of shared values and beliefs (Dahl, 1971) are considered fertile ground for democracy, Lijphart (1968, 1999) has shown that the politics of accommodation and compromise carried out by the elites of socially divided countries and the institutional rules granting minorities with government participation and power-sharing, ensure a better functioning of (‘consociational’) democ- racies. Moreover, consensual political systems reduce the difference in democratic satisfaction between winners and losers in the election game (Anderson & Guillory, 1997; Bernauer & Vatter, 2012; Wells & Krieck- haus, 2006). The level of ethnic, linguistic, and religious fragmentation (i.e., Cultural fractionalization) is measured through the well-known Fractionalization index (Alesina et al., 2003).9 Furthermore, we also check for political and institutional variables. We include a measure of the level of ideological polarization through Dalton’s Polarization index (2008).10 In ideologically polarized coun- tries there is considerable ideological distance among parties and within the electorate. As a consequence, the functioning of democracy is more ‘difﬁcult’ (Sani & Sartori, 1983), and the legitimacy accorded to the political system is widely questioned. This is because in polarized systems ideology determines citizens’ mentality (dogmatic politics), the presence of anti-system parties is highly likely, the overall mechanics of the system is centrifugal, opposition parties are unaccountable, and governing parties 9 See Chapter 7 for more information on this measure and the related data sources. 10 See Chapter 7 for more information on the related formula and data sources. For a similar use of polarization as a control variable for explaining satisfaction with democracy, see Nemˇcok and Wass (2020). 200 A. CHIARAMONTE AND V. EMANUELE have low democratic responsibility (Sartori, 1976). As regards institu- tional features, we also check for the effect of the electoral system, as done in previous studies (Farrer & Zingher, 2019;Nemˇcok & Wass, 2020; Singh, 2018).11 The argument is that as ‘election outcomes are more representative in countries with proportional election systems, citi- zens might be more satisﬁed here’ (Reher, 2015, 167. See also Aarts & Thomassen, 2008; Bernauer & Vatter, 2012; Lijphart, 1999). As a proxy of the electoral system’s features, consistent with Chapter 7,weuse the natural log of the Average District Magnitude (ADM). Finally, we add two time-related measures. First, we add a measure of democratic tradition, considering the timing of the democratic onset as a potentially relevant factor to be taken into account for explaining both the subjective and objective levels of democracy. For this task, we employ the natural log of the age of a country’s democracy as of 2019 (Birth year of democracy).12 Second, we add a trend variable, Time (measured as the number of years elapsed since 1945); ‘in time-series analysis, the trend variable helps to avoid the problem of spurious correlation arising when the values of the dependent variable and those of more indepen- dent variables vary independently but in a consistent direction over time’ (Roberts & Wibbels, 1999, 581–582; see also Tavits, 2005, 290). A synthetic scheme of all hypotheses, factors, measures and expected effect on our measures of subjective and objective democracy is summa- rizedinTable 8.1, while Table 8.2 reports the descriptive statistics of the dependent and (unlogged) independent variables included in the models.13 11 Singh (2018) also checks the effect of the type of regime on satisfaction with democ- racy. We have excluded this control from our main models, given the very low variation of this variable in our set of cases (see also later in the text). 12 Similarly, Farrer and Zingher (2019)and Nemˇcok and Wass (2020)measure the length of democratic tradition as the number of years during which the index of institu- tionalized democracy based on the Polity IV scale included in the V-Dem dataset is six or higher (it ranges from 0, least democratic to 10, most democratic). In our sample, all observations had at least six on this variable in the period under study, which makes their measure a simple count of the age of a country’s democracy. That is why we preferred our measure of Birth year of democracy, already employed in Chapter 7,where theage of a country’s democracy collected from Mainwaring et al. (2017) refers to the historical moment in which democracy was inaugurated (e.g., Ireland in 1921) rather than to the starting year of data collection in the V-dem dataset (i.e., 1945 for all countries). 13 As our two dependent variables (Satisfaction with democracy and Electoral democracy index) have a 0–1 range, our index of PSI has been rescaled to a 0–1 range from the 8 THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTY SYSTEM … 201Table8.1Hypotheses,factors,measures,andexpectedeffectondemocracyinWesternEurope(1946–2019):ageneralschemeHypothesisFactorMeasureDependentvariableMeasureExpectedeffectHp1PartysysteminstitutionalizationPSIindexSubjectivedemocracySatisfactionwithdemocracy+Hp2ObjectivedemocracyElectoraldemocracyindex+ControlCorruptionPoliticalcorruptionindexControlClientelismClientelismindexControlEconomicdevelopmentGDPpercapitaControlCulturaldivisionofthesocietyCulturalfractionalizationindexControlIdeologicalpolarizationPolarizationindexControlElectoralsystemAveragedistrictmagnitude(ADM)ControlBirthyearofdemocracyAgeofacountry’sdemocracyasof2019ControlTimeNumberofyearssince1945 202 A.

While V-Dem and Eurobarometer data variates yearly across units,14 our original PSI data variates only across elections (or legislatures). Given that our key variable original 0–100 range. This would facilitate the readability of the regression coefﬁcients. The same rationale applies to the Cultural fractionalization index (rescaled to a 0–1 range from the original 0–100 range). The GDP per capita is instead reported in thousands of US dollars. The number of cases refers to the overall number of observations of the regression models in Table 8.3. 14 For Eurobarometer data, we reported the mean of the two waves administered in a given year. 8 THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTY SYSTEM … 203 of interest is PSI, since we aim at testing its effect on democracy, our explanatory analysis deals with a pooled time-series cross-section (TSCS) dataset (Beck & Katz, 1995) with repeated observations over time (elec- tion years) on the same ﬁxed units (countries), and a balance between cross-section units and temporal ones (Stimson, 1985). In this context, errors may be both panel-heteroskedastic (each panel has its own vari- ance) and serially correlated within panels. We performed some diagnostic tests that conﬁrmed the presence of panel-heteroscedasticity and autocor- relation in the data. In particular, we performed an LR-test for panel heteroskedasticity (p < 0.001) and a Wooldridge test of autocorrelation (p < 0.01) (Drukker, 2003).15 To tackle issues of panel heteroskedas- ticity and autocorrelation, consistent with the regression analyses of Chapter 7, we opted for the panel-corrected standard errors method (PCSE) with a ﬁrst-order autoregressive parameter (AR1), namely, the so-called Prais–Winsten regression (Beck & Katz, 1995).16 15 We replicated the same test on the model with the ‘objective’ measure of democracy, and the result was very similar (p < 0.001). Conversely, a diagnostic test conﬁrmed that there are no serious problems of multicollinearity among the independent variables. 16 Contemporaneous correlation across panels (one of the assumptions of the PCSE method) has been ruled out given non-contemporaneous electoral cycles across coun- tries (the number of electoral periods within panels in the models ranges between 1 and 15, hence we have unbalanced panels). Consequently, only the correction for panel-level heteroskedasticity has been included. Moreover, we have performed Hausman tests to compare the results of ﬁxed and random effects models. The result is that H0 (i.e., the difference in the coefﬁcients is not systematic) is not rejected as there is no corre- lation between the unobserved heterogeneity and the independent variables. Hence, a random effects model can be used (Treiman, 2009, 371). Given that some covariates in the model are entirely or almost time-invariant (i.e., Birth year of democracy, Cultural fractionalization, Average district magnitude), the inclusion of country-ﬁxed effects is not recommendable (Beck & Katz, 2004, 2007; see also Imai & Kim, 2019; Mainwaring et al., 2017;Tavits, 2006) as ‘unit dummies completely absorb differences in the level of independent variables across units’ (Plümper et al., 2005, 331). However, as a further check, we have performed a leave-one-out test by rerunning the analyses excluding one country at a time, and the results substantially conﬁrm those reported in Table 8.3 (see Tables 8.10 and 8.11 and the related discussion in the chapter Appendix). This means that national speciﬁcities do not exert a decisive role, and the decision to perform a pooled analysis is correct (Beck & Katz, 2004). Moreover, we also replicated the regression anal- yses in Table 8.3 with alternative model speciﬁcations (see Tables 8.7 and 8.8 and the related discussion in the chapter Appendix). 204 A. CHIARAMONTE AND V. EMANUELE 8.3 Results and Discussion Table 8.3 reports the results of the regression of, respectively, Satisfaction with democracy (Model 1) and the Electoral democracy index (Model 2) on party system institutionalization and other control variables.17 The explanatory analysis conﬁrms our expectations: PSI exerts a posi- tive and signiﬁcant effect on both the ‘subjective’ (Hp1) and ‘objective’ measures of democracy (Hp2). As shown in Model 1, PSI is a positive and signiﬁcant predictor of Satisfaction with democracy. This means that as far as interparty competition becomes stable and predictable, citizens’ satisfaction with democracy increases. Conversely, in unstable and unpredictable environments, citizens become, all else being equal, more dissatisﬁed with the way democracy works in their country. Model 2 repeats the analysis in Model 1 through the same checks, but replaces Satisfaction with democracy with the Electoral democracy index, and the results show that the positive effect of PSI is even more signiﬁcant (p < 0.01). This means that variation in levels of stability and predictability of interparty competition does not only affect the perception of democracy, but also matters with regard to its core values and objective standards.18 As discussed at the beginning of the chapter, previous research has claimed that party system institutionalization is a necessary or even a sufﬁcient condition for the consolidation and the survival of democracy 17 Model 1 covers only 157 observations as Satisfaction with democracy has only been available since 1973 in 18 countries (all but Iceland and Switzerland). Moreover, observa- tions in Malta are automatically dropped from Model 1 as we lack data on the Polarization index in the country after 1998. As a result, the number of countries covered by Model 1 is 17. The results are almost the same if we exclude the Polarization index from Model 1, thus running the regression analysis on 18 countries. Furthermore, as regards the seem- ingly spectacular R-squared in Model 2 (0.988), note that in Prais–Winsten regression the R-squared cannot be interpreted and compared as in the OLS regression. Indeed, as stated by Wooldridge (2015, 384), ‘for OLS, the R-squared, as usual, is based on the regression with the untransformed dependent and independent variables. For Prais– Winsten, the R-squared comes from the ﬁnal regression of the transformed dependent variable on the transformed independent variables. It is not clear what this R-squared is actually measuring’. 18 PSI maintains its positive and signiﬁcant effect if we include the ‘objective’ measure of democracy index in Model 1, similarly to what was done by Reher (2015)and Nemˇcok and Wass (2020) who included a measure of democratic quality or development in their analysis on satisfaction with democracy. Vice versa, the effect of PSI is the same if we include an index for the ‘subjective’ measure of democracy in Model 2. Moreover, PSI remains signiﬁcant if we omit one or more variables in the model. 8 THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTY SYSTEM … 205 Table 8.3 Regression analysis of democracy on party system institutionalization Model 1 Model 2 Satisfaction with democracy Electoral democracy index bpcse b pcse Party System Institutionalization 0.152* 0.0598 0.0286** 0.00967 Political corruption index −0.427* 0.218 −0.00158 0.0381 Clientelism index −0.710* 0.285 −0.196*** 0.0533 GDP per capita (y−1) 0.00589*** 0.00116 −0.0000728 0.000183 Cultural fractionalization index −0.254* 0.124 −0.0510** 0.0196 Polarization index −0.101 0.129 −0.0142 0.0228 Average district magnitude (ln) 0.00405 0.00878 −0.000612 0.00155 Birth year of democracy (ln) 0.0169 0.0474 −0.0193** 0.00698 Time since 1945 −0.00341* 0.00168 0.000747** 0.000261 Constant 0.614** 0.229 0.929*** 0.0348 R-squared 0.619 0.988 Wald χ 2 95.73*** 56.52*** Number of elections 157 157 Number of countries 17 17 Note Prais–Winsten AR1 regression; panel-corrected standard errors are reported. †p < 0.10; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 (Casal Bértoa, 2017; Mainwaring & Scully, 1995). So far, however, the link between PSI and democracy was only found in young and fragile democracies, such as those in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. Our analysis ﬁnds that an association between party system insti- tutionalization and democracy exists even in the context of the allegedly strong and long-term consolidated Western European democracies. We think this is a relevant ﬁnding for our understanding of the factors that enhance democracy but also to gauge properly the role exerted by party system institutionalization, which clearly goes beyond its more immediate effects on citizens’ satisfaction and inﬂuences the very foundations of a democratic polity. In order to provide a better visualization of the results, Fig. 8.1 plots the regression coefﬁcients of Models 1 and 2 in a standardized form, so as to allow a comparison of the explanatory power of the different factors on, respectively, Satisfaction with democracy (left pane) and Electoral democracy index (right pane). 206 A. CHIARAMONTE AND V. EMANUELE Fig. 8.1 Plots of the regression coefﬁcients of satisfaction with democracy (left pane) and electoral democracy index (right pane) As it can be easily noticed, the coefﬁcients of the various factors are comparatively lower in the case of the Electoral democracy index. This is essentially due to the lower variability of the objective measure of democracy, as already shown by its descriptive statistics in Table 8.2.19 The low variability of the objective measure of democracy in Western Europe is also underlined by Reher (2015, 167) with reference to other indices taken from Freedom House and Polity IV. Indeed, Western Euro- pean democracies have high democratic standards, as witnessed by the high value of the overall mean (0.87) and the limited empirical range of the index (from 0.77 to 0.92). Conversely, Satisfaction with democ- racy, resulting from citizens’ perceptions is, not surprisingly, susceptible to higher variation as it shows a mean of 0.59 and a range going from 0.13 to 0.94. This is why the coefﬁcient of PSI on the Electoral democ- racy index, despite being lower compared to that of PSI on Satisfaction with democracy (0.005 against 0.02620), displays a higher statistical signiﬁcance (p < 0.01 against p < 0.05). For the sake of consistency and comparability with Model 1, Model 2 is presented here on the same 157 observations for which we have data on 19 See also the boxplots by country of the two dependent variables in Figs. 8.2 and 8.3 in the chapter Appendix. 20 In the non-standardized analysis (Table 8.3), as PSI moves from 0 to 1, Satisfaction with democracy increases by 0.15 while Electoral democracy index increases by 0.03. 8 THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTY SYSTEM … 207 Satisfaction with democracy. Moreover, Table 8.4 in the chapter Appendix reports the model with the total number of available observations for the Electoral democracy index. In that model, the observations rise to 260 in 20 countries and the effect of our main independent variable, PSI, remains signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. At this point, one may argue that the effect of PSI on democracy is potentially endogenous, in that a reverse causality also takes place. Indeed, one may hypothesize that democracy also plays a role in explaining PSI. This is because, in countries where people are more satisﬁed with the way democracy works, voters are more likely to conﬁrm their previous voting choices, thus reducing electoral and parliamentary volatility and the success rate of new parties. At the same time, in countries with higher democratic standards, the accountability is a matter of fact and, there- fore, interparty competition is expected to be more predictable. We have addressed this issue by running a two-stage least squares (2SLS) instru- mental variable regression (IVreg) of the two measures of democracy (Satisfaction with democracy and Electoral democracy index, respectively) with PSI assumed as an endogenous regressor, followed by an ordi- nary least square regression (OLS) with PSI assumed as an exogenous regressor.21 Then, following Cameron and Trivedi (2009, 182–184), we performed a Hausman test to compare the results of the IVreg and the OLS regressions. The result is that H0 (i.e., the difference in the coefﬁcients is not systematic) is not rejected, and therefore, PSI is exoge- nous in both models of democracy (i.e., the subjective and the objective measures). The alternative Durbin-Wu-Hausman test of endogeneity led to the same result.22 We can safely conclude that PSI can be considered an exogenous predictor of both measures of democracy. The results reported in Table 8.3 and Fig. 8.1 hold after controlling for several variables that were expected to inﬂuence the explanandum. 21 As the instrument for PSI, we have to choose a variable that is at the same time correlated with the endogenous regressor (PSI) and uncorrelated with the dependent variables (Tavits, 2008, 545). Therefore, we have chosen the Class index, which is a powerful predictor of PSI (as shown in Chapter 7) but is not expected to be a predictor of democracy. 22 Moreover, while PSI is a signiﬁcant predictor of both measures of democracy (as shown in Table 8.3), the latter are not signiﬁcant predictors of PSI. Indeed, by repeating Model 2 in Table 6.3 (i.e., the regression of PSI on its determinants) with the addition of, respectively, Satisfaction with democracy and Electoral democracy index, both variables are not signiﬁcant predictors of PSI. 208 A. CHIARAMONTE AND V. EMANUELE The analysis also brings evidence of the negative role played by corrup- tion, clientelism and cultural divisions. Both measures of democracy are affected by such factors, with the exception of corruption which is not a signiﬁcant predictor of the Electoral democracy index. The latter is strongly affected by clientelism, which is by far the most powerful discriminant between (relatively) strong and weak democracies in Western Europe. Moreover, the presence of cultural (i.e., ethnic, linguistic, and religious) divisions affects both measures of democracy negatively. This ﬁnding seems to go in the direction of Almond and Verba (1963)and Dahl (1971), who long ago suggested a positive effect of cultural homo- geneity and the presence of shared values and beliefs for democracy. Conversely, this ﬁnding seems to put into question Lijphart’s claim that consociational democracies work better, as they trigger, all else being equal, greater dissatisfaction among citizens.23 Furthermore, other control variables, such as ideological polarization or district magnitude, do not inﬂuence the two measures of democ- racy.24 That said, we also notice the presence of some differences in the explanatory factors of the two measures. First, the national economic development exerts a positive and signiﬁcant effect only on Satisfaction with democracy.25 All else being equal, a wealthier society expresses more satisfaction toward the way democracy works, but economic develop- ment does not inﬂuence the objective measure of democracy. Second, the timing of the democratic onset is negatively associated with the Electoral democracy index, which means that countries where democracy was inau- gurated earlier have comparatively lower democratic standards. However, 23 Note that the negative effect of the Cultural fractionalization index on the Electoral democracy index becomes not signiﬁcant in the model including all available cases (Table 8.4). For a more speciﬁc and in-depth analysis of the relationship between consensual democracy and citizens’ satisfaction, see Bernauer and Vatter (2012). 24 As regards the electoral system the absence of a signiﬁcant relationship with Satis- faction with democracy is not surprising, as mixed evidence on this effect was previously found by Aarts and Thomassen (2008), Anderson and Guillory (1997), and McAllister (2005). 25 The effect of PSI is the same if we replace the measure of GDP per capita with the GDP growth rate of a country in the previous year as a measure of the national economic performance. This measure is useful as economic downturns may foster dissatisfaction and distrust toward democratic institutions. Data are taken from the Total Economy Database (The Conference Board, 2019). 8 THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTY SYSTEM … 209 this effect does not seem robust, as it disappears in the regression anal- ysis including all available observations and countries for which we have data (Table 8.4). Finally, the two measures of democracy have experi- enced the opposite trend over time. While Satisfaction with democracy has signiﬁcantly declined in Western Europe since the 1970s, the region has progressed in terms of democratic rules and procedures after WWII. The effect of time is the same if we replace the linear coefﬁcient with a categorical coefﬁcient for each decade (with the 1950s as reference), as done in Table 8.5 in the chapter Appendix. In both models, PSI remains signiﬁcant with the same level of statistical conﬁdence, but the Wald Chi- square of both models increases, thus demonstrating an improvement in the goodness of ﬁt due to the more ﬁne-grained speciﬁcation of time. Besides this different operationalization of time, we have cross-checked the robustness of our main ﬁndings with different model speciﬁcations. These analyses conﬁrm the substantive and signiﬁcant effect of PSI on both measures of democracy (see Tables 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, 8.10, 8.11 and the related discussion in the chapter Appendix). To sum up, both measures of democracy are affected by party system institutionalization in Western Europe. This ﬁnding is potentially a harbinger of relevant consequences for the quality of the democratic process in the region. This is because, as shown in Chapters 6 and 7, Western Europe has been in a process of party system deinstitutionaliza- tion in recent years. At the same time, the ‘subjective’ side of democracy is also currently under stress, as it has shown a decline over the last few years (see Model 1 in Tables 8.3 and 8.5). The overall share of citizens that are fairly or very satisﬁed with the way democracy works in their countries decreased from 66 to 59% between the 2000s and the 2010s. Conversely, the same trend does not apply as far as objective democratic indicators are concerned. However, notwithstanding the overall increase in democratic standards over time (see Model 2 in Tables 8.3 and 8.5), such a trend stops in the 2010s, the ﬁrst decade the Electoral democracy index does not increase compared to the previous decade but remains stable (0.876 on average).26 Although the foundations of democracy are still solid in Western Europe, the tight association between PSI and democracy and the undergoing deinstitutionalization process lead us to question whether 26 However, note that other agencies, like Freedom House, report a net loss in demo- cratic indicators also affecting Western Europe in the last years, as part of a more general democratic backlash (Freedom House, 2019). 210 A. CHIARAMONTE AND V. EMANUELE the current high democratic standards of Western European countries will be preserved in the coming decades. Indeed, it may well be that a decline in party system institutionalization will reduce citizens’ satisfaction with the way democracy works even more and will, at least in the long run, negatively affect the very foundations of democracy itself: its rules, proce- dures, and outcomes. This is because dissatisﬁed citizens would accord less legitimacy to the system, and this would be likely to make political actors less accountable and less committed to the democratic game. Thus, an ongoing process of party system deinstitutionalization may trigger a vicious cycle in which negative consequences on democracy in Western Europe would emerge. 8.4 Conclusion Existing research shows that party system institutionalization plays a crucial role in democratizing countries. Democracy tends to consoli- date when the party system is institutionalized, namely when parties and their interactions remain relatively stable over time. On the contrary, the consolidation of democracy is prevented by a weakly or under- institutionalized party system, i.e. a party system characterized by enduring instability and unpredictability in the pattern of interparty competition. This analysis has moved research forward on party system institution- alization and its consequences on democracy, by shifting the focus from consolidating to consolidated democracies. Speciﬁcally, we have analyzed whether and to what extent the deinstitutionalization of party systems may undermine democracy within the context of Western European coun- tries. For a long time the latter were characterized by stable party systems and largely unconditional adherence to the ideals of democracy, but more recently have undergone major transformations, at least in some cases. The results of our analysis offer a rather positive answer to our research question. Indeed, party system institutionalization in Western Europe positively affects both the subjective component of democracy, that is, the way democracy is perceived to work by the citizens of said democratic society, and its objective components, that is, the set of rules, proce- dures, and outcomes that deﬁne the extent to which a country can be considered as democratic. In other words, the stability and predictability of interparty competition not only shape party system characteristics but also affects citizens’ satisfaction with the way democracy works and even 8 THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTY SYSTEM … 211 the objective democratic standards. This ﬁnding is not a good piece of news for Western Europe, given that the region is currently undergoing a decline in party system institutionalization. The latter would reduce citi- zens’ satisfaction with the way democracy works, and, at least in the long run, have a detrimental impact on the very foundations of democracy, namely its rules, procedures, and outcomes. Should party system deinsti- tutionalization continue to affect Western European countries and make their citizens more and more dissatisﬁed, even the objective component of democracy may be facing a profound crisis in the long run.

In particular, we have added to the two models in Table 8.3 a control for age of democracy, opera- tionalized as the number of years elapsed since the birth of democracy (Reher, 2015). Unlike Birth year of democracy, measuring a ‘cohort effect’ (see Chapter 7), age of democracy captures an ‘age effect’, namely whether the indicators for subjective and objective democracy change as democracy grows older, regardless of when it was established (see also Mainwaring et al., 2017). Moreover, we have also replicated Table 8.3 by adding a dichotomous variable for semi-presidential or presiden- tial systems. Although considered by other authors (Singh, 2018), this variable has not been included in the general models due to its limited variation in Western Europe. It is operationalized through a dichotomous 214 A. CHIARAMONTE AND V. EMANUELE variable (0 = parliamentary; 1 = semi-presidential or presidential). Table 8.6 reports the results of the models including these controls. These anal- yses conﬁrm the substantive and signiﬁcant effect of PSI on both measures of democracy. Furthermore, Model 1 shows the negative effect of age of democracy on citizens’ satisfaction (i.e., as democracy grows older, voters become more dissatisﬁed), while Model 4 corroborates the negative effect of presidential systems on the Electoral democracy index. As a further check of the robustness of our ﬁndings, we have rerun the analyses through alternative regression models. Speciﬁcally, the models in Table 8.3 and 8.427 have been replicated through ﬁve alternative estima- tion techniques: (1) Generalized estimating equations (GEE) regression with an autoregressive correlation structure (Liang & Zeger, 1986; Madrid, 2005; Mainwaring & Zoco, 2007; Mainwaring et al., 2017); (2) Feasible generalized least square (FGLS) regression with a correction for panel heteroskedasticity and an autoregressive correlation structure (Parks, 1967); (3) Multilevel mixed model (MIXED) with countries set as random intercepts (Maggini & Emanuele, 2015; Rabe-Hesketh & Skro- ndal, 2008; Schmidt-Catran & Fairbrother, 2016); (4) Panel-corrected standard error regression (PCSE) (Beck & Katz, 1995); and (5) Gener- alized linear model (GLM) estimator with logit link function and robust standard errors (Costalli & Ruggeri, 2019). All the results are reported in Tables 8.7 and 8.8 and 8.9. The effect of PSI and also the general story concerning the impact of the other control variables on the two measures of democracy proves to be robust across different estimation techniques. Finally, we have performed a leave-one-out test by rerunning the anal- yses of Models 1 and 2 of Table 8.3, excluding one country at a time. The results are summarized in Tables 8.10 and 8.11. The test largely conﬁrms the results discussed above by showing that the effect of PSI is robust to individual countries’ exclusion (Tables 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, 8.10,and 8.11).28 27 The regressions of the Electoral democracy index have been run on the same obser- vations for which we have data on Satisfaction with democracy (as in Model 2 of Table 8.3) and on all available observations (as in Table 8.4). 28 In particular, as regards Satisfaction with democracy, the effect of PSI is always signiﬁcant, but it weakens at p < 0.10 if exclude Greece, while it strengthens at p < 0.01 if we exclude Luxembourg, Portugal or the United Kingdom. On the other hand, as regards the Electoral democracy index, the effect of PSI is always signiﬁcant, but it weakens at p < 0.10 if we exclude Greece, at p < 0.05 if we exclude France, the Netherlands, or Spain, while it strengthens at p < 0.001 if we exclude Italy or Portugal. 8 THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTY SYSTEM … 215Table8.6ReplicationofTable8.3withtheadditionofthecontrolsforageofdemocracyandpresidentialregimeModel1Model2Model3Model4SatisfactionwithdemocracyElectoraldemocracyindexSatisfactionwithdemocracyElectoraldemocracyindexbpcsebpcsebpcsebpcsePartySystemInstitutionalization0.186**0.06230.0317**0.010.142*0.06010.0256**0.0098Politicalcorruptionindex−0.3340.220.008410.0384−0.429*0.2180.002620.036Clientelismindex−0.785**0.278−0.203***0.0525−0.731*0.29−0.213***0.0511GDPpercapita(y−1)0.00504***0.0011−0.0001670.00020.00583***0.0012−0.0000590.0002Culturalfractionalizationindex−0.2250.119−0.0474*0.0194−0.249*0.124−0.0512**0.0179Polarizationindex−0.09750.132−0.01350.0228−0.08760.129−0.00550.0235Averagedistrictmagnitude(ln)0.000550.009−0.001140.00160.001010.0093−0.001740.0016Birthyearofdemocracy(ln)0.3120.1650.01360.02680.01060.0482−0.0210**0.0066Timesince19450.001010.00270.00125**0.0005−0.00338*0.00170.000731**0.0002Ageofdemocracy−0.00326*0.0017−0.0003690.0003Presidential−0.06450.0485−0.0183**0.0061Constant−0.7020.7420.782***0.1210.658**0.2360.942***0.0339R-squared0.6200.9880.6240.986Waldχ2112.12***46.99***99.28***74.05***Numberofelections157157157157Numberofcountries17171717NotePrais–WinstenAR1regression;panel-correctedstandarderrorsarereported.†p<0.10;*p<0.05,**p<0.01,***p<0.001 216 A.
