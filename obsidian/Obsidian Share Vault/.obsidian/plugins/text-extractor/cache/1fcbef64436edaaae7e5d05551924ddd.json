Analysis by Dan Balz November 10, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST The question was asked countless times over the past few years: What is the future of the Republican Party? That question was answered on Tuesday by the voters. The party’s future is its present: President-elect Donald Trump. The pertinent question now is what is the future of the Democratic Party? Get the latest election news and results Defeat has launched a reckoning for Democrats. Ahead of Tuesday, many Democrats could not fathom that Trump could prevail, let alone win Supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris sit in the bleachers on Tuesday at Howard University, where her campaign held its election night party.

The search for answers has begun. Start with some fundamentals. This was a tough environment for the incumbent party. President Joe Biden’s approval rating on Election Day was 40 percent positive and 59 percent negative, according to network exit polls. Even in an era when politicians have uniformly low approval ratings, that 59 percent negative judgment was an anchor that weighted down Vice President Kamala Harris. On Election Day, 68 percent of voters said the economy was either “not so good” or “poor,” according to exit polls. Democrats wanted voters to focus on low unemployment, sustained if modest growth and a stock market that continued to expand everyone’s retirement accounts. Voters had another view: 46 percent said their family’s finances were worse today than four years ago while 24 percent said they were better; 75 percent said inflation had caused a moderate or severe hardship on them or their families. Overall, voters were in a sour mood. In the exit polls, 73 percent said they were either dissatisfied or angry. This was an environment in which voters were calling for change — as they have in every election since 2006, except for 2012, when President Barack Obama was reelected. Of the 28 percent of the electorate 12/16/24, 7:42 PM Democrats face a reckoning and a long rebuilding.

Given all that, it’s not so surprising that the party that held the White House and the Senate was driven out of power. Amid all the internecine finger-pointing about what Harris and her campaign could or should have done differently, and those questions are legitimate, it’s important to remember how much fundamentals affect the outcome of elections. In the midterm elections two years from now, if Trump fails to deliver on the broad promises of his campaign, if the economy falters, if a Trumpian Republican Party without overwhelming strength in Congress proves incapable of governing effectively, Democrats could believe they are truly on the rebound. If history is any guide, and in the Trump era that’s not always a safe assumption, Democrats are likely to make gains in Congress in 2026. Beyond the climate that burdened Harris, however, last week’s election highlighted the challenges Democrats have to confront to wrest power back. Trump has accelerated a realignment of the American electorate based on education, which has been the most significant fault line in politics since his first campaign in 2016. In 2024, it proved to be more significant than the gender gap, which drew 12/16/24, 7:42 PM Democrats face a reckoning and a long rebuilding.

Colleagues at The Washington Post offered insight into this with an article analyzing the electorate that put Trump in the White House for a second time. The conclusion: The Trump coalition in 2024 was more diverse, younger and more working-class than the coalition that voted for him previously. Voters without college degrees supported Trump by a margin of 14 percentage points, the most for any Republican since 1984. In that year, Ronald Reagan won them by 19 percentage points en route to a landslide victory by winning 59 percent of the popular vote and carrying 49 states. Trump managed to attract these working-class voters though his popular vote percentage currently stands at about 51 percent.

There is no quick fix. - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 4/10 Trump’s coalition remains overwhelmingly White in its makeup, but one reason he has expanded his coalition is the shift in support among Latinos, particularly Latino men. Nationally, Trump carried Latino men by 54 percent to 44 percent. His support grew by 19 percentage points from 2020. In Texas and in Florida, he won Latino men with 64 percent of the votes. Increasingly it appears that the Hispanic vote will be up for grabs, rather than solidly Democratic. That’s a huge change that Democrats cannot ignore. And it speaks to the broader decline in support among working-class voters generally. Political parties are not static institutions. They are organic, capable of adapting and responding to setbacks. What this requires is not playing the blame game internally or looking for scapegoats or criticizing those for voting the other way. It requires sober analysis, a sound theory of the way back and a leader who can distill that into a winning campaign. The most effective presidential candidates are often those who can define or redefine their party, as Trump and Obama did, rather than simply being defined by the party. Harris, because she entered so late in the election cycle, because she was the vice president and because she had not independently carved out an identity when she ran in the 2020 campaign, 12/16/24, 7:42 PM Democrats face a reckoning and a long rebuilding.

In some ways, the Democrats have faced worse moments. Republicans scored three huge presidential victories in 1980, 1984 and 1988, winning a total of 1,437 electoral votes to 173 for the Democrats. By 1992, voters were turning out an incumbent Republican president, George H.W. Bush, and handing the presidency to Bill Clinton, a Democrat. By 1996, Clinton was winning voters without college educations by 14 percentage points — an almost complete reversal of Reagan’s strength from 12 years earlier. Clinton was part of a larger effort to assess the party’s problems, with deep research by pollster Stanley Greenberg into why working-class voters in Macomb County, Michigan, were defecting and with much of the intellectual President Joe Biden speaks about the election in the Rose Garden of the White House on \u0000ursday.

It was left to Clinton, however, to synthesize all this into a compelling package, one that sought to de-emphasize the party’s most significant vulnerabilities, though not abandoning them wholesale, and finding new policies and ideas designed to change the image of the party in ways that would bring voters back. The losses Democrats suffered on Tuesday were not of the numerical magnitude of the Republican victories in the 1980s. Harris lost Wisconsin by less than a percentage point, Michigan by less than 2 points, Pennsylvania by 3 points. Trump’s electoral college majority, after he was projected Saturday to have won in Arizona, the last state to be called, is 312, smaller than both of Obama’s totals in 2008 and 2012. But that doesn’t mean the Democrats’ problems are not severe. In an era when there are few swing states, when most are either solidly blue or solidly red, winning working-class voters — whether Whites in places like those three Northern states or Latinos in the Southwest — is critical. And at the same time, Democrats must energize Black voters in the cities and suburban voters as well. 12/16/24, 7:42 PM Democrats face a reckoning and a long rebuilding. There is no quick fix. - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 7/10 Today there are competing ideas about what the party must do to win back more working-class voters. For some on the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) being the leading proponent, that means a more robust and populist economic program. Sanders lost that fight to Biden in the 2020 primaries, but the party’s progressive wing remains robust. For others, however, it means hewing even more to center- left policies, a recognition that many voters judged Harris as too far left for their tastes. Trump and his campaign seized on immigration. They lied about Haitian migrants eating people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio. Democrats were understandably outraged. But they underestimated broader concerns of voters about what had been a surge of undocumented immigrants coming into the country. When Republican governors sent busloads of migrants to northern cities, Democratic officeholders had to plead with the White House to help them deal with the strain on resources. The Trump campaign also exploited the Democrats’ embrace of identity politics and specifically for transgender rights with an ad attacking Harris for advocating for transgender surgeries for prison inmates paid for by taxpayers. The tagline on the ad said, “Kamala’s for they/them. President Trump is for you.” The Supporters are seen cheering through bulletproof glass as former president Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, on Nov. 3.

Clinton’s New Democrat formulation is a thing of the past. Some of the policies from that era have been rejected, especially some of the tough-on-crime measures that resulted in massive incarcerations of Black men. What worked then is not a prescription for what will work now. The country has changed, and the Democratic Party has changed. The Democratic Party is centered more than ever in big urban centers and has lost touch with too many voters in rural areas. Its coalition is more diverse and more difficult to unite. It has lost some of its economic identity while identity politics of a different kind have taken on more significance. What is most valuable to remember as Democrats begin this period of self-reflection is that what took place many years ago was an intellectual exercise with a political objective. The product was also something that did not enjoy immediate acceptance. Clinton had to formulate it and then test it in the real world of politics against opposition from others in the party, in a competition of ideas before he could take it to the country as a whole. Too often in these moments, political parties look for an easy fix — a new message or a 12/16/24, 7:42 PM Democrats face a reckoning and a long rebuilding.

The problems Democrats now confront are complicated and years in the making. Listening is the first step — understanding why many people were willing or even wanted to vote for Trump, given his obvious flaws — and building from what they learn. Only after that can they begin to regain the trust needed to be able to compete in places where they have been left behind. By Dan Balz Dan Balz is chief correspondent at \u0000e Washington Post.
