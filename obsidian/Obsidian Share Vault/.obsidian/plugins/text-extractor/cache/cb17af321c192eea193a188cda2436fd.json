Thus, market participants are exposed to signiﬁcant risks caused by extreme price outcomes, periods of heightened volatility, and their transmission between interconnected markets. In addition, uncertainties induced by the current transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources for power generation pose substantial challenges. For retailers or generators, these challenges include making decisions on eﬀective investments and hedging, and for regulators, guaranteeing a reliable, secure supply of electricity. This thesis aims to shed light on risk management in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) in the above context. It follows the format of ‘thesis by publication’ and contains three research papers, each of which explores one or more related dimensions. The ﬁrst study examines volatility spillover eﬀects across interconnected regions in the NEM. This study applies the econometric framework originally proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012) to assess market aggregate spillover eﬀects and their directional decomposition between individual regions, both statically and dynamically. We ﬁnd that spillover eﬀects are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by regional proximity and interconnectors, while exhibiting diﬀerent patterns during peak and oﬀ-peak hours. We further relate the dynamic spillover patterns to speciﬁc short-term market events as well as to long-term changes in the renewable energy share and the generation capacity, and to the implementation of a carbon pricing mechanism. The second study extends the analysis of the ﬁrst and focuses on extreme price outcomes. It examines the persistence of price spikes for individual markets and the dependence of extreme prices across diﬀerent regions in the NEM. We apply the extremogram (Davis and Mikosch, 2009; Davis et al., 2011, 2012) to both 5-minute and half-hourly prices and ﬁnd that extreme prices are more persistent in markets with a higher share of intermittent renewable energy, or more concentrated markets than in the other markets. We also ﬁnd signiﬁcant extremal dependence between physically interconnected adjacent regions, which shows asymmetric patterns. Further, based on the estimated extremograms, we show the eﬀectiveness of the Australian Energy Market Commission’s 2016 rebidding rule change in reducing the strategic behaviour of market participants. The third study examines the proﬁtability and investment risk of diﬀerent generation tech- nologies used in the NEM, by assessing dispatch-weighted prices (DWPs) and earnings-at-risk (EaR) of generators. We ﬁnd that dispatchable generators, such as hydro, natural gas, bat- tery storage, kerosene and diesel oil plants with controllable and ﬂexible output, achieve signiﬁcantly higher DWPs than less ﬂexible generators, such as coal ﬁred power plants. They also achieve higher DWPs than non-dispatchable renewable energy generation from solar and wind farms. In addition, although dispatchable and ﬂexible generators that have stronger correlations with spot prices have signiﬁcantly higher upside earnings potential compared to coal ﬁred power plants and variable renewable energy generators, their EaRs are also much higher, which indicates greater uncertainty in proﬁts. Further, DWPs and earnings are af- fected by seasonal patterns, and higher uncertainty and dispersion in summer are observed for both. 2 Statement of Originality This work has not previously been submitted for a degree or diploma in any university.

IX CHAPTER 1 Introduction This thesis investigates various risks in the Australian electricity sector, aiming to provide a better understanding of extreme events, risk transmission and investment risks in electricity markets. It aims to shed light on eﬀective strategies for market participants and investors to mitigate their risks and provide information for regulators to achieve a reliable and secure supply of electricity, low electricity costs for businesses and households and a sustainable, low carbon emission economy. In particular, three related research topics are discussed, namely, (i) volatility spillover eﬀects, which measure the eﬀects of volatility shocks in one market on other inter- connected markets, (ii) extremal dependence, which measures the persistence of extreme price outcomes in each market and the transmission of extreme prices be- tween interconnected markets, and (iii) dispatch-weighted prices (DWPs) and earnings-at-risk (EaR) of diﬀerent generation technologies, which provide an indi- cation for the proﬁtability and investment risk of market participants. 1.1 Background 1.1.1 Risks in electricity markets Since the introduction of deregulated and competitive electricity markets worldwide, the risks for market participants have increased substantially. Despite the recent progress in energy storage technology, electricity continues to be a non-storable good 1 Chapter 1. Introduction and hence requires immediate delivery. This feature leads to an extremely tight rela- tionship between electricity demand and supply (Weron, 2006). That is, substantial price changes in the spot price can be observed in response to relatively small changes in generation, demand or networks. Hence, spot electricity markets are signiﬁcantly more volatile than other comparable commodity markets with a high risk of extreme price outcomes and periods of substantial price volatility. Interestingly, signiﬁcant spillover eﬀects of so-called price spikes and volatility occur between interconnected electricity markets, increasing the risk to participants who operate simultaneously in several markets. Meanwhile, a signiﬁcant transition occurring in the global energy sector involves reduc- ing the dependence on fossil fuel ﬁred generation and increasing the use of renewable energy to limit carbon emissions (Tietjen et al., 2016; Maryniak et al., 2019). This transition has induced further risks for new investors and existing participants in elec- tricity markets, such as, e.g., uncertainties caused by the variation in renewable energy supply, increased price volatility and a lack of clarity about future carbon reduction policies. In addition, policymakers face substantial challenges related to the need to guarantee a reliable, secure supply of electricity in a changing market scenario. 1.1.2 Risks in the Australian National Electricity Markets This thesis focuses on the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), which is a nationally interconnected system with strong linkages between individual regions. The NEM consists of ﬁve state-based regional markets, which are New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA), Tasmania (TAS) and Victoria (VIC). Whole- sale electricity trading in the NEM is conducted in a spot market in which demand and supply are matched in real-time to determine the generators to dispatch and a uniform price for each regional market. Electricity in the NEM can be traded from a low price region to a high price region through interconnectors, which are high-voltage transmission lines between adjacent regional markets. This mechanism aims to mit- 2 Chapter 1. Introduction igate the price diﬀerences between regions and reduce the overall electricity costs to customers. However, the interregional electricity trade is limited by the capacity of the interconnectors. As Higgs and Worthington (2008) and Mayer and Trück (2018) have highlighted, the Australian NEM is among the most volatile and spike-prone electricity markets in the world. Fig. 1.1 provides a time series plot for the intraday and daily spot prices in NSW. As shown in Fig. 1.1, the spot electricity price can jump from below A$100/MWh to hit the market cap ($14000/MWh on 10 February 2017, the day for which the time series was plotted) and drop back within several hours. In addition, periods of substantial volatility can be observed, which tend to persist and appear in clusters. Firms without appropriate strategies to manage risks arising from extreme prices can see their revenue of an entire year evaporate in as short a period as a few hours or days. Therefore, investigating extreme price events and substantial volatility periods in the NEM context is a topic of particular interest. Fig. 1.1: Time series plots for daily spot prices from July 2009 to January 2020 and intraday spot prices on 10 February 2017 in NSW. Extreme price outcomes and volatility often transmit across the NEM through the in- terconnection between regions. However, as can be observed in Fig. 1.2, the spillover eﬀects tend to vary by time and by region. While joint price spikes can be observed on certain occasions, some markets can remain unaﬀected or be aﬀected after a certain time lag when price or volatility shocks appear in another market. The assessment of 3 Chapter 1. Introduction patterns in spillover eﬀects in the NEM is of great importance particularly for large generators and retailers operating simultaneously in diﬀerent regional markets. Un- derstanding the transmission of shocks and volatility provides important insights for planning cross-regional operations and hedging strategies for these market participants. Spillover assessment is also of interest to merchant interconnectors and to traders who derive revenue based on price diﬀerences between regions by typically purchasing elec- tricity from a low price region and simultaneously selling it to a high price region. Conversely, as the Australian Energy Market Commission (2013) stated, a long-run objective of the NEM is to provide an integrated market with similar electricity prices across all regional markets. Since volatility spillover eﬀects are considered a required feature of market integration (Ciarreta and Zarraga, 2015), the assessment of spillovers is also of signiﬁcance to regulators in evaluating the eﬃciency and suﬃciency of existing market interconnections and the potential of the NEM to achieve further integration. Fig. 1.2: Half-hourly spot prices for the ﬁve regional markets in the Australian NEM on two days: 11 January 2010 and 10 July 2012. Logarithm transformation is applied for easy visualisation. In line with the worldwide energy transition, the NEM is under a substantial transfor- mation to a lower emission economy. Although the NEM is still dominated by fossil fuel ﬁred generation, numerous older plants are close to the end of their service life, thus becoming less reliable, and are gradually being shut down (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018). In particular, over 4.1 gigawatt of coal ﬁred generators have exited 4 Chapter 1. Introduction the NEM in a short period of three years, 2014–2017 (Rai and Nunn, 2020). As Rai and Nelson (2020) highlighted, the investment in new ‘dispatchable’ generation assets, such as coal or natural gas generators that are controllable with a certain level of ﬂexi- bility, has been limited owing to concerns surrounding regulatory uncertainties. These uncertainties include carbon policies, changes in demand or demand proﬁles as well as technology-induced risks such as, for example, advancement in storage facilities for electricity. Much of the gap caused by the exit of fossil fuel generators is ﬁlled by a signiﬁcant volume of variable renewable energy (VRE) plants, such as wind and solar farms, that have intermittent and ‘non-dispatchable’ output. As a result, the combina- tion of the increased uncertainty related to VRE outputs, the exit of high capacity old plants and the lack of additional capacity from dispatchable generators has increased spot prices and price volatility in the NEM since 2017, which is illustrated in Fig. 1.1. As the Australian Energy Market Operator (2017, 2019) suggested, suﬃcient invest- ment should be made in both VRE and dispatchable generators to guarantee stable, secure electricity supply to the market. However, under the current environment, in- vestors are exposed to signiﬁcant risks related to the uncertainty whether future earn- ings will cover the various costs of investment and operations. Figs. 1.3 and 1.4 show the daily DWPs (i.e. per MWh earnings) in 2019 for typical generators that use dif- ferent types of technologies: a generator that has a continuous but less ﬂexible output, which is typically used for base or intermediate load (e.g. coal and combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)); a VRE generator that has an intermittent, non-controllable output (e.g. wind); and a peak-load generator that has a more expensive but ﬂexible output, which increases when prices increase (e.g. open cycle gas turbine (OCGT)). Generator earnings are plotted for NSW and SA, which are markets dominated by black coal generation, and wind and gas generation, respectively. As can be observed, the earn- ings patterns vary substantially, depending on the generator and the market. While base load and VRE generators typically achieve a DWP similar to the spot regional price, the DWPs of peak load generators are signiﬁcantly higher. However, there can be an extended period of zero earnings for peak-load generators when spot prices are relatively low and less volatile. Further, for VRE generators, such as the wind gen- 5 Chapter 1. Introduction erator in SA, negative DWPs are obtained on many occasions. Thus, assessing the vastly diﬀerent earnings and risk proﬁles is of signiﬁcant importance to investors and policymakers for eﬃcient decision-making.

Note that a considerable number of days without DWP data can be observed in Panel D for the OCGT generator (URANQ). These days indicate ‘zero earning’ days for this generator, i.e. the daily DWP cannot be calculated because of zero dispatch from this generator on these days. 6 Chapter 1.

These days indicate ‘zero earning’ days for this generator, i.e. the daily DWP cannot be calculated because of zero dispatch from this generator on these days. 7 Chapter 1. Introduction Motivated by the risk factors identiﬁed thus far, three studies are presented in Chap- ters 2–4, which are aimed at generating insights on eﬀective risk management under the changing NEM environment. In Chapters 2 and 3, the transmission of price volatility and extreme price outcomes are addressed by analysing volatility spillover eﬀects and extremal price dependence, respectively. In Chapter 4, the proﬁtability and investment risks of diﬀerent generation technologies in the NEM are examined. In the next section, the structure and the contribution of each chapter are described in more detail. 1.2 Structure and contributions of the thesis Chapter 2, titled ‘Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets’, examines volatility spillover eﬀects across the interconnected NEM regions. Applying the econo- metric framework of Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012), we assess aggregate spillover eﬀects of markets as well as their directional decomposition between individual regions, both statically and dynamically. We also investigate the eﬀects of speciﬁc market events on the dynamic spillover patterns, including short-term demand surges and generation outages as well as long-term changes in the share of renewable energy, the fuel mix and the generation capacity, and the implementation of a carbon pricing mechanism (CPM). This study contributes in several ways to the limited number of multivariate studies (see, e.g., Aderounmu and Wolﬀ 2014a,b; Higgs et al. 2015; Apergis et al. 2016; Ig- natieva and Trück 2016; Manner et al. 2016; Nepal and Foster 2016; Smith and Shively 2018) on electricity markets. First, we apply the spillover method of Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012) (DY), which has been widely applied to other ﬁnancial markets, such as equity, bond and foreign exchange markets (Antonakakis and Vergos, 2013; Claeys and Vašíček, 2014; Cronin, 2014; Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014; Narayan et al., 2014; Maghyereh et al., 2015), but has found limited application to spot electricity markets (Apergis et al., 2017). We conﬁrm the usefulness of the DY method in cap- 8 Chapter 1. Introduction turing the transmission of electricity price volatility eﬃciently and in responding to relevant market events. In addition, we signiﬁcantly extend the work of Apergis et al. (2017) by using a more recent sample period and an extended data set. In particular, we incorporate the interconnected TAS market—which is playing an increasingly im- portant role with high renewable penetration and a merchant interconnector but has not been analysed before—and thoroughly examine the inﬂuence of regulatory changes and temporal market events. Second, in comparison to previous studies, we provide a deeper analysis of volatility spillover eﬀects in the Australian NEM by assessing de- tailed patterns of these eﬀects, such as their magnitudes, directions and time variations. We ﬁnd that spillover eﬀects are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by regional proximity and in- terconnection. Both magnitude and direction of spillover eﬀects are time-varying and event-dependent. Although volatility spillovers are playing an increasingly important role in the overall NEM volatility, regional market volatilities are still largely inﬂuenced by local factors. Third, our results add important empirical evidence on the impacts of the recent introduction and abolishment of the CPM on spillover eﬀects in the NEM, which, to the best of our knowledge, are yet to be documented in the literature. We ﬁnd that the establishment of the CPM overall reduced volatility spillovers, whereas its abolishment increased the spillover eﬀects. Further, these eﬀects are more pronounced for oﬀ-peak volatility spillovers. Chapter 3 is titled ‘Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets’. It extends the analysis presented in Chapter 2 and focuses on extreme price outcomes. Apply- ing the extremogram method that Davis and Mikosch (2009) and Davis et al. (2011, 2012) developed, it examines the dependence between extreme price events within in- dividual regions and between diﬀerent regional markets in the NEM. In addition, we apply extremograms to investigate the eﬀects of a change to a market rule on genera- tors’ strategic behaviours, which is considered an important factor that contributes to extreme price spikes and interregional price diﬀerences. The literature on extreme events in electricity markets is more focused on univariate modelling of spikes or jumps in electricity prices (Christensen et al., 2009, 2012; Korni- 9 Chapter 1. Introduction ichuk, 2012; Clements et al., 2013; Eichler et al., 2014; Herrera and González, 2014), and has paid limited attention to the transmission of extreme prices across diﬀerent markets (Clements et al., 2015; Manner et al., 2016; Bigerna et al., 2017; Manner et al., 2019; Do et al., 2020). Thus, this chapter contributes to the existing literature in three ways. First, we apply a relatively new econometric technique, the extremogram (Davis and Mikosch, 2009; Davis et al., 2011, 2012), which so far has only had a very limited number of application to energy markets. The method allows us to successfully capture the transmission of electricity price spikes in the NEM context. Second, compared to the existing literature that examines extreme prices in electricity markets, we provide more details on the patterns in extremal dependence. Evidence such as the magnitude, direction and persistence of extreme spillover eﬀects are documented. We ﬁnd that extreme prices are more persistent in markets with a higher share of VRE generation, or in more concentrated markets. Extremal dependence is more signiﬁcant between regions that are physically interconnected, and also shows time-dependent and asym- metric patterns. Third, we examine the eﬀectiveness of a rule change for last minute bids made by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) in Australian Energy Market Commission (2015), which has not been examined by the existing literature. The estimated extremograms before and after the rule change show that the new rule has been eﬀective in terms of reducing the strategic behaviour of market participants. Chapter 4, titled ‘Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia’, examines the proﬁtability and investment risks of diﬀerent generation tech- nologies in the NEM. We focus on two regional markets with very diﬀerent generation mixes: the largest market in the NEM, the NSW market that is dominated by genera- tion from coal ﬁred power plants, and the market in SA that has recently shut down all generation from coal and relies mainly on electricity generation from renewable energy and gas ﬁred stations. We use a unique dataset containing data on the generation by all power plants in the considered markets to assess the DWPs and the upside earnings potential that can be obtained, and the EaR for diﬀerent type of generation technologies. 10 Chapter 1. Introduction This study contributes to three streams of existing literature. The ﬁrst is the invest- ment risk literature (see, e.g. Morthorst 1999; Kaldellis and Gavras 2000; Montes and Martín 2007; Williges et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2010; Cutler et al. 2011; Katsigiannis and Stavrakakis 2014; Gatzert and Vogl 2016), which typically focuses on a particular type of generation technology and simulates various risk factors of an investment from an in- vestor’s perspective. The second stream is the energy portfolio management literature (see, e.g. Huang and Wu 2008; Allan et al. 2011; Delarue et al. 2011; Bhattacharya and Kojima 2012; DeLlano-Paz et al. 2015; Tietjen et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2018), which fo- cuses on optimising a portfolio of energy assets by considering their cost–return proﬁle and correlations. Lastly, the third stream is the performance evaluation literature (see, e.g. Hirth 2013, 2016; Hirth and Radebach 2016; Schmalensee 2016; Eising et al. 2020; Prol et al. 2020; Rai and Nunn 2020), which compares the market value of diﬀerent power plants based on the actual market price and power generation. The study con- tributes to the above identiﬁed literature in three dimensions: ﬁrst, by using a dataset that includes all stations in the considered markets, we provide a comprehensive com- parison of the revenue–risk proﬁle for various types of electricity generation, including dispatchable and non-dispatchable energy technologies, which cover the overall market supply, regardless of whether they are used for base load, intermediate load, or peak load purposes. Second, we extend the performance evaluation literature by considering the proﬁtability and the market value of power plants from a risk management per- spective and by examining the simulated distribution properties of DWPs. In addition, both the upside earnings potential and the EaR are estimated to provide an improved understanding of the dispersion of earnings that can be obtained through each gen- eration technology. We ﬁnd that dispatchable generators, such as hydro, natural gas, battery storage, kerosene and diesel oil plants, that have a controllable and ﬂexible output achieve signiﬁcantly higher DWPs than less ﬂexible generators, such as coal ﬁred power plants. They also achieve higher DWPs than VRE generators, namely, solar and wind farms, which are non-dispatchable. Although dispatchable and ﬂexible generators that have a stronger correlation with spot prices have a signiﬁcantly higher upside earnings potential compared with coal ﬁred plants and VRE generators, their 11 Chapter 1. Introduction EaR are also much higher, which indicates greater uncertainty with regard to proﬁts. Third, we use a sample period marked by distinct features: the exit of high capac- ity fossil fuel ﬁred power plants, an increased share of renewable energy generation (especially VRE generation), and an NEM spot price that was more than double the price in comparison to previous periods. The results generate important insights on investment risks, in a setting of highly volatile spot prices and a signiﬁcantly changed energy resource mix, which are relevant to the current NEM context. Lastly, Chapter 5 concludes and discusses the implications of this thesis on risk man- agement in the electricity sector from diﬀerent dimensions. 12 References References Aderounmu, A.A., Wolﬀ, R., 2014a.

Abstract Electricity markets are signiﬁcantly more volatile than other comparable ﬁnancial or commodity markets. This study examines volatility spillover eﬀects across diﬀerent regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), aiming at pro- viding a better understanding of the transmission of risks in a multi-regional context. Our analysis is based on the econometric framework originally proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012). We conduct both a static and a dynamic assessment of aggregated spillover eﬀects as well as their directional decomposition between the indi- vidual regions. We ﬁnd that volatility spillovers are typically more pronounced between physically interconnected markets. We further relate the dynamic spillover patterns to speciﬁc short-term market events as well as long-term changes in the share of renew- able energy, fuel mix, generation capacity, and the implementation of a Carbon Pricing Mechanism. Our ﬁndings provide important insights to market participants and regu- lators with regard to cross-regional trading of electricity, developing risk management strategies, and building additional interconnector infrastructure to facilitate regional market integration in the NEM.

Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets 2.1 Introduction This study investigates volatility spillovers between spot electricity prices across diﬀer- ent regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). We aim to provide a better understanding of risk and volatility transmission in electricity markets in a multi-regional context. In particular, we examine patterns of volatility spillover eﬀects in the NEM as well as how these patterns are related to speciﬁc market characteristics, events and regulatory policy. Due to the non-storable nature of electricity, spot electricity prices are one of the most volatile ﬁnancial assets. Extreme price outcomes, referred to as price spikes, and pe- riods of substantial price volatility are major sources of risks for market participants. Factors that have contributed to price and volatility shocks typically include the main- tenance of power plants, the congestion of interconnectors or main transmission lines, and more recently also periods of low or no wind, i.e., very low generation of renew- able energy. Interestingly, during volatile periods, often signiﬁcant spillover eﬀects to connected electricity markets can be observed (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2017a). By deﬁnition, spillovers are the eﬀects that shocks or crises in one region have on another region through external links (Pesaran and Pick, 2007). For ﬁnancial markets, these spillover eﬀects are typically characterised by the transmission of extreme price outcomes and volatility. For the energy sector, the analysis of these eﬀects is important, especially for businesses that simultaneously operate in several electricity markets, since the probability of joint price spikes and high volatility imposes signiﬁcant risks. This study focuses on the Australian NEM as a nationally interconnected system with strong linkages between the individual regions. The NEM comprises ﬁve state-based regional markets (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017): New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA), Tasmania (TAS) and Victoria (VIC). Whole- sale trading in the NEM is conducted in a spot market, where electricity supply and 21 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets demand are matched in real time to determine a price for each region. In addition, electricity is transmitted across diﬀerent regions within the NEM through intercon- nectors, which are high-voltage transmission lines between adjacent regional markets. This allows electricity to be imported from a low price region to a high price region. However, the volume of transmission is limited by the physical capacity of these inter- connectors. For a geographic representation of the Australian NEM and an overview of interconnector capacities refer to Section 2.A in Appendix. The assessment of spillover eﬀects for the volatility of spot electricity prices is of partic- ular interest to Australian electricity markets. Electricity spot prices in the Australian NEM are even more volatile and spiky than in other comparable markets (Higgs and Worthington, 2008; Mayer and Trück, 2018), while price spikes often occur simulta- neously in diﬀerent regions (Clements et al., 2015; Ignatieva and Trück, 2016). The analysis of volatility spillovers may therefore provide further insights on the transmis- sion of extreme outcomes in electricity prices for Australia. Further, a long-run objec- tive of the NEM is to provide a single integrated market with similar electricity prices across the diﬀerent states (Australian Energy Market Commission, 2013). However, so far diﬀerent regions in the NEM are still considered to be relatively isolated, which is reﬂected by the sizeable price diﬀerences across regions (Higgs, 2009; Apergis et al., 2016; Nepal and Foster, 2016). One related concern that has been raised by stakehold- ers is the potential underinvestment in interconnectors (Garnaut, 2011; Productivity Commission, 2013). Since volatility spillover eﬀects are considered as required features for market integration (Ciarreta and Zarraga, 2015), the analysis of these eﬀects is also relevant for evaluating the eﬃciency of existing market interconnections and the potential of the NEM to achieve further integration. Since the 1990s there is a rapidly growing literature on deregulated electricity mar- kets. However, only over the last decade studies have started to focus more on the interrelationship of electricity prices or volatility across diﬀerent markets. In the US context, De Vany and Walls (1999a,b) were the ﬁrst to study the joint behaviour of electricity spot prices in decentralised electricity markets using cointegration and 22 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets impulse-response analysis, suggesting evidence of highly integrated and eﬃcient whole- sale power markets in the western US. Park et al. (2006) ﬁnd a separation of western from eastern spot electricity markets in contemporaneous time, while Dempster et al. (2008) suggest only a moderate degree of market integration. In the European context, Haldrup and Nielsen (2006) use a Markov switching fractional integration model to ex- amine price interdependence between pairs of regional markets in the Nordic countries. Studying the integration of European electricity markets using Principle Component Analysis, Zachmann (2008) rejects the existence of a single integrated market, but ﬁnds pairwise price convergence between several countries after considering congestion costs. Le Pen and Sévi (2010) estimate a multivariate GARCH-BEKK model and show the existence of return and volatility spillovers in three major European electric- ity forward markets. Bunn and Gianfreda (2010) examine the transmission of shocks and integration between European electricity forward markets, using causality tests, cointegration and impulse-response analysis. Multivariate GARCH models are used in Ciarreta and Zarraga (2015) and De Menezes and Houllier (2015) to assess mean and volatility spillovers of electricity prices. Bigerna et al. (2017) examine contagion eﬀects and their relationship to a higher share of renewable energy in regional elec- tricity markets in Italy, ﬁnding signiﬁcant evidence for contagion. Alasseur and Féron (2018) develop a structural model for electricity prices that allows deriving spot and forward prices in coupled markets with limited interconnector capacity and diﬀerent fuel sources. Gianfreda and Bunn (2018) propose a ﬂexible model for hourly electricity prices, where the parameters of the density function are latent state variables and can be dynamically modelled as functions of exogenous drivers that may include load, wind and solar feed-in, fuel prices or transmission between interconnected markets. Also in the Australian context, there are some existing studies focussing on the in- terdependence of regional electricity prices. From a long-run perspective, Nepal and Foster (2016) suggest that the Australian NEM has not achieved full integration, while Apergis et al. (2016) ﬁnd some evidence of price convergence for three markets in the NEM, namely NSW, QLD and VIC. From a short-run perspective, Smith et al. (2012), Aderounmu and Wolﬀ (2014a,b), Smith (2015), Ignatieva and Trück (2016) and 23 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets Manner et al. (2016) apply a series of copula models to measure the nonlinearity in multivariate electricity price modelling, especially in assessing tail dependence of spot prices between diﬀerent regions. Clements et al. (2015) ﬁnd evidence of price spike transmissions across interconnected regions in the NEM using a multivariate point process model, while Smith and Shively (2018) apply constrained nonparametric func- tions to estimate cost and supply functions in combination with copulas to examine structural relationships between regional spot electricity prices. Other studies focus on price volatilities and their transmission or spillover eﬀects in Australian electricity mar- kets. Worthington et al. (2005) and Higgs (2009) employ diﬀerent GARCH and DCC type models to examine the eﬀects of interregional electricity price volatility spillovers. Furthermore, Higgs et al. (2015) investigate the impacts of a series of demand and sup- ply factors on electricity price volatility. Taking into account interregional electricity ﬂows, they ﬁnd that the generation mix exerts a strong inﬂuence on electricity price volatility. In this study, we employ the econometric framework proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012) to investigate spillover eﬀects in the NEM to address the above questions. The chosen approach has some appealing features in assessing spillover eﬀects. First, the nature of the method is similar and closely related to impulse response function analysis which is widely used to explore time-paths of shock transmissions across eco- nomic systems (see, e.g., De Vany and Walls, 1999b; Park et al., 2006; Le Pen and Sévi, 2010). However, unlike standard applications of impulse response analysis, the proposed spillover measure has the advantage that it can be easily aggregated and thus allows to quantify various spillover eﬀects. This includes the transmission of volatility shocks from one region to another, the total volatility shocks transmitted or received by one region as well as a system-wide aggregated spillover index which measures the share of price volatility that is caused by spillover eﬀects (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012). Furthermore, by using a rolling-window approach, the applied analysis can monitor the magnitude of spillover eﬀects through time, without having to pre-specify a series of breakpoints or scenarios. 24 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets The application of the DY framework in the literature originally focused mainly on equity, bond and foreign exchange markets (Antonakakis and Vergos, 2013; Claeys and Vašíček, 2014; Cronin, 2014; Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014; Narayan et al., 2014; Maghyereh et al., 2015). In recent years, there have also been a number of applications of the method to commodity markets, see, e.g., Kang et al. (2014); Zhang and Wang (2014); Baruník et al. (2015); Roy and Roy (2017); Zhang (2017) and Luo and Ji (2018). With a more speciﬁc focus on the electricity sector, Jaeck and Lautier (2016) employ the DY method to electricity derivative markets and assesses volatility spillovers across electricity futures with diﬀerent maturities. However, it is well-known that electricity spot prices exhibit an entirely diﬀerent, more ’spiky’ and volatile behaviour than futures prices. Ferrer et al. (2018) use the DY framework to examine return and volatility connectedness between U.S. clean energy companies, crude oil prices and ﬁnancial variables, while Ji et al. (2019) examine information spillover between changes in carbon prices and returns from major European electricity companies. Most recently, Chuliá et al. (2019) apply the DY approach to investigate dynamic spillover eﬀects between international electricity, natural gas, CO2, oil and coal markets. To the best of our knowledge, Apergis et al. (2017) are the only authors to apply the DY framework to the analysis of spot prices in interconnected electricity markets. The authors investigate the volatility connectedness among NSW, QLD, SA and VIC over the period from December 1998 to May 2016 and ﬁnd asymmetries in the connectedness emerging from volatility caused by positive and negative price returns. We aim to sig- niﬁcantly extend the work of Apergis et al. (2017), by using a more recent and reﬁned sample period, also incorporating the interconnected market of TAS into our analysis, and examining whether the time variation in spillover eﬀects can be related to regula- tory changes or speciﬁc market events. The regional market of TAS can be considered as an important part of the NEM with a substantial share of renewable generation mainly from hydropower. In addition, while most interconnectors in the Australian NEM are regulated interconnectors that receive a ﬁxed revenue, the interconnector be- tween TAS and VIC (Basslink) is the only merchant interconnector in the NEM which earns proﬁts by participating in interregional trading. Since price diﬀerences between 25 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets regions are highly relevant to the proﬁts of a merchant interconnector, the analysis of spillover eﬀects between TAS and the rest of the NEM will be of particular interest to Basslink. Regarding regulatory events, we focus in particular on the impact of the Carbon Pricing Mechanism (CPM), when electricity generators where charged an additional price for each tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emission. We examine whether short-term market events (like extreme demand, tight supply conditions, the temporary closure of generation facilities, network congestion, or extreme weather events) can be related to the variation in spillover eﬀects between the markets. We also investigate how long- term changes in the NEM such as the increasing share of generation from renewable sources or the permanent closure of major coal-ﬁred power stations impact on spillovers. We examine both market aggregated and directionally decomposed spillovers in the Australian NEM, while the analysis is also conducted using a dynamic setting. By using daily electricity price volatility from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2017, we also cover the periods before, during and after the Australian CPM that was in place between July 2012 and June 2014. Thus, our study also allows us to examine the evolution of volatility spillover eﬀects across these three sub-periods. In addition, we estimate spillover eﬀects during peak and oﬀ-peak hours separately, reﬂecting volatility transmission patterns under diﬀerent supply-demand conditions and for a diﬀerent generation mix. Our ﬁndings suggest that although spillover eﬀects play an important role in the overall market volatility in the NEM, regional market volatilities are still largely inﬂuenced by local factors. Among the ﬁve regions in the NEM, VIC, NSW and SA all transmit and receive signiﬁcant volatility spillover eﬀects, while VIC is the most important market in transmitting shocks to others. This diﬀers from ﬁndings by Apergis et al. (2017) who suggest that SA is the most signiﬁcant net spillover transmitter, while VIC is a net spillover receiver. The magnitude and direction of spillover eﬀects both exhibit time variations, and a large part of these time variations could be related to extraordinary events and policy changes in the NEM. In addition, patterns of volatility spillovers 26 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets are highly inﬂuenced by the interconnector structure of the NEM: greater spillover eﬀects are observed where physical interconnections exist, conﬁrming the signiﬁcant role of interconnectors in facilitating integration between regions. Our ﬁndings are robust when separate assessments are conducted for sub-periods with regard to the introduction and repeal of the 2012-2014 CPM that is typically referred to as the ‘carbon tax’. Interestingly, we also ﬁnd that since the abolishment of the tax and the end of the sample period, system-wide aggregate volatility spillover has increased. This may be a result of the recent reduction in generation capacity in some of the markets due to the shut-down of coal-ﬁred power plants, making inter-regional trade more important, but also leading to higher prices across all markets. We further show that the impacts of the CPM are more pronounced for baseload volatility spillovers or spillovers during oﬀ-peak periods since high-emitting fossil fuel generation which is more inﬂuenced by the CPM is dominating baseload generation during oﬀ-peak hours. Our results on spillover eﬀects are also relatively robust to alternative parameter speciﬁcations such as, for example, the chosen lag length in the applied VAR models, the applied forecast error variance decomposition approach, the forecast horizon, or the length of the rolling window. Overall, our results contribute to the literature in three directions. First, we conﬁrm the usefulness of the DY spillover method in eﬃciently capturing the transmission of electricity price volatility. Second, compared with the existing literature, we provide a deeper analysis of volatility spillover eﬀects in the Australian NEM by estimating more detailed patterns of these eﬀects, such as their magnitudes, directions and time variations. Finally, by using more recent data, our results add important empirical evidence on the impacts of the recent introduction and abolishment of the CPM on spillover eﬀects in the NEM, which has not been documented in the literature yet. From a practical perspective, our results provide important information for partici- pants in the NEM who are concerned about high volatility periods of spot prices and the transmission of these events across regions. For example, retailers who are op- erating simultaneously in several diﬀerent regions have to take spillover eﬀects into 27 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets consideration when making risk management and hedging decisions. Our results are also of great interest to electricity traders and so-called merchant interconnectors, be- cause price diﬀerences and spillover eﬀects across regions are highly relevant to their revenue. Furthermore, our results also provide important information for regulators who aim to evaluate current market interconnections and systemic risks as a result of extreme events in a singular or multiple markets, the potential of the NEM to achieve integration, and impacts of the inclusion of renewable resources on market volatility. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2.2 provides a brief overview of the institutional background and features of the Australian NEM. Sec- tion 2.3 introduces our research methodology, while Section 2.4 summarises the prop- erties of the data used in this study. Empirical ﬁndings are provided in Section 2.5. These include the results of both static and dynamic spillover analyses, as well as several robustness checks for diﬀerent sub-periods and choice of model speciﬁcations. Finally, Section 2.6 concludes. 2.2 The Australian National Electricity Market The Australian NEM began operating as a wholesale market in December 1998 with the aim of increasing market eﬃciency for the electricity sector (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017). When establishing the NEM, a major aim was to provide a nationally integrated market, limiting the market power of generators in each regional market (Productivity Commission, 2013). The NEM now operates as a wholesale electricity market, guaranteeing the electricity supply to the ﬁve state-based regional markets in NSW, QLD, SA, VIC and TAS. Networks in each state are linked to others via interconnectors, which are the physical transmission lines connecting adjacent regions. For a map of the NEM and a table of the interconnector capacities, see Fig. 2.A.1 and Table 2.A.1 in Appendix. The spot market in the NEM operates as a central pool managed by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). It is an ‘energy only’ gross pool with mandatory participation (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017), i.e., all 28 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets electricity generated has to be sold through this pool, aggregating electricity output from all generators to meet demand in real-time. Generators submit bids every thirty minutes, specifying the amount and the price they oﬀer. AEMO then determines the generators to produce electricity based on a least-cost optimisation. Thus, generators with lower marginal costs will be given priority to supply electricity. Every ﬁve minutes AEMO determines a dispatch price for each region. The ﬁnal half-hourly electricity spot price is then determined as the average of six ﬁve-minute interval prices. As mentioned above, the NEM comprises some of the most volatile spot electricity markets in the world (Higgs and Worthington, 2008; Mayer and Trück, 2018). During our sample period, the market price cap (the highest possible electricity spot price) has been increased from A$10,000 to A$14,200 per MWh (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017); and spot prices have been close to or reached the market price cap on several occasions. Furthermore, spot prices in diﬀerent regional markets appear to exhibit tail dependence (Smith et al., 2012; Aderounmu and Wolﬀ, 2014a,b; Ignatieva and Trück, 2016), which means price spikes and high price volatilities tend to occur jointly in diﬀerent regions. Electricity generation in Australia predominantly relies on fossil fuels. For example, in 2017, about 88% of the overall electricity generation was from fossil fuels, with around 77% from black and brown coal and 11% from gas (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2017a). However, in recent years also an increasing share of electricity generation from renewable energy sources could be observed: during our sample period from 2010 to 2017, the share of generated renewable energy increased from 9.6% to 12%. Hereby, in particular hydropower (55%) and wind power (36%) represent the largest share of renewable generation in the NEM for the year 2017. Regarding generation by region, NSW, QLD and VIC rely heavily on coal generation, while TAS and SA have larger shares of renewable energy generation. In 2017, over 90% of TAS’s generation and 40% SA’s generation came from renewable energy with the majority of generation in TAS coming from hydropower, while the penetration of wind generation is especially strong in SA (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2017a). 29 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets In terms of electricity consumption, from 2010 to 2017, NSW accounted for the largest share (about 36%), followed by QLD (29%) and VIC (23%), while the shares of SA and TAS were around 7% and 5% (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018). Interestingly, due to the signiﬁcant uptake of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) installations that can help households to oﬀset electricity usage during the day, in recent years the overall demand for electricity from the grid has declined quite substantially (Nelson et al., 2018). In interregional trade, NSW, SA, and TAS were typically net electricity importers, with the exception of TAS being a net exporter during the carbon tax period from July 2012 to June 2014. At the same time QLD and VIC were typically net exporters (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017). Currently there are six interconnectors linking ﬁve regional markets: QNI and Ter- ranora between NSW and QLD, Heywood and Murraylink between VIC and SA, the VIC-NSW interconnector between NSW and VIC, and Basslink (an undersea power ca- ble) between VIC and TAS (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017). Except for Basslink, all of these interconnectors operate as regulated interconnectors 1. Electricity can be imported into one region through interconnectors when the output of local generators is insuﬃcient to meet demand, or when the electricity price in the adjoining market is low enough to replace local supply. This mechanism facilitates market integration (Nepal and Jamasb, 2012) and promotes competition in electricity wholesale markets, especially in a concentrated market with limited market participants. Under optimal conditions, prices were to align across regions, with the diﬀerence only to account for physical transmission losses during the delivery of electricity (Australian Energy Reg- ulator, 2017). However, as pointed out before, the eﬃcient transmission of electricity across regions is limited by the physical transfer capacity of the interconnectors. The limitation of interconnector capacity is one deﬁning feature of the NEM (Higgs and Worthington, 2005; Higgs, 2009; Nepal and Jamasb, 2012), limiting generation capacity to remain within the local market. As a result, regional markets in the NEM 1 A regulated interconnector receives ﬁxed revenue determined by the regulator based on the value of the asset. The actual interconnector usage is not considered in calculating this revenue. In comparison, an unregulated interconnector, which is also called a merchant interconnector, derives revenue by participating in interregional trades in the spot market (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017). 30 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets are still considered as isolated, which is reﬂected by the substantial price diﬀerences between regions, and the occurrence of unnecessarily high price and volatility regimes 2. In particular, Nepal and Foster (2016) investigate the usage of interconnector capacity in the NEM. They ﬁnd the existence of signiﬁcant transmission bottlenecks in all inter- connectors and thus propose more investments in capacities of existing interconnector as well as into new interconnectors. The Australian NEM has also experienced several regulatory changes over the last decade: one important change that is relevant to our sample period is the CPM that was in operation between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2014. This mechanism was introduced by the Australian Labor Government in order to reduce carbon emissions in the electricity sector which could possibly help to mitigate climate change (Maryniak et al., 2019). The CPM placed a ﬁxed price (similar to a tax), starting at A$23/MWh, on each tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emission. The CPM had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the electricity sector, because electricity gen- eration contributes a large proportion to overall carbon emissions in Australia. The major impacts can be summarised as follows: ﬁrst, the tax signiﬁcantly increased the cost of electricity generators during the two-year carbon pricing period between July 2012 and July 2014. As a result, although electricity demand declined during this period, spot prices in the NEM generally exhibited a substantial rise. However, in- creases in electricity spot prices were not the same across all regions in the NEM. For example, due to a high shares of renewable generation the price increase for TAS was much lower than for the other four NEM regions (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017; Apergis et al., 2016). Second, the carbon tax also slightly altered the composition of electricity generation in the NEM. The market share of coal generation dropped and even reached a historical low in the 2013-2014 ﬁnancial year, while the share of gen- eration from renewables, especially hydro generation increased signiﬁcantly (Maryniak 2 The important role of interconnectors is evidenced by a recent event related to the outage of the interconnector between TAS and VIC (Basslink) on December 20, 2015, when TAS was isolated from the NEM and electricity spot prices in TAS increased up to 400% above their normal levels of around A$40 per MWh and exceeded A$200 per MWh. High price levels and volatility lasted for a period of over four months until Basslink was back in operation (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2017a). 31 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets et al., 2019). Finally, changes in regional prices and the generation mix in the NEM further altered the interregional electricity ﬂows, in particular for TAS. Typically, TAS was a net electricity importer, while during the carbon tax period, due to the increased local hydro output and the relatively low regional prices, TAS became an electricity exporter. During the 2013-2014 ﬁnancial year, TAS even recorded the highest ratio for exports of all regions since the NEM began its operation (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017). In our empirical analysis we will also investigate the impact of this major policy change on price spillover eﬀects across the markets. 2.3 Methodology We apply Diebold and Yilmaz’s (DY) (2009, 2012) spillover method to estimate volatil- ity spillover eﬀects in the Australian NEM. This framework was developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) based on using forecast error variance decomposition from a vec- tor autoregressive (VAR) model (Sims, 1980). The method has further been extended by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) based on a generalised variance decomposition (GVD) framework (Koop et al., 1996; Pesaran and Shin, 1998). In the following, we provide a brief overview of the approach. 2.3.1 Forecast error variance decomposition of vector autore- gressive (VAR) model Following Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012), we ﬁrst estimate an N -variable VAR(p) model xt = Ψ + ∑p i=1 Φixt−i + εt, where εt ∼ (0, Σ) is a vector of independently and identically distributed error terms, Σ is the variance-covariance matrix for εt, and Ψ is an intercept vector. In this study, N = 5 for ﬁve regional markets and t refers to the date (i.e. daily time series). The moving average representation of a covariance stationary VAR exists, which is xt = ∑∞ i=0 Aiεt−i. The N × N coeﬃcient matrices follow the recursion Ai = Φ1Ai−1 + Φ2Ai−2 + ... + ΦpAi−p, where A0 is an N × N 32 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets identity matrix and Ai = 0 for i < 0. These moving average coeﬃcients are the key to analyzing the dynamics of the considered system, because they measure the eﬀects of shocks on xt at diﬀerent points in time. In the next step, variance decompositions are applied which allow us to dissect the forecast error variance of each market into parts which are attributable to various system shocks. Thus, for each variable xi, (i = 1, . . . , N ) we can analyze which frac- tion of the error variance in forecasting xi can be attributed to shocks to variable xj, ∀j ̸= i. Note that the decomposition of forecast error variance requires isolated shocks. However, economic data generally exhibit contemporaneously correlated shocks or in- novations (Park et al., 2006). To address this issue, identifying uncorrelated shocks is necessary. Following Diebold and Yilmaz (2012), we employ the generalised vari- ance decomposition (GVD) framework that was introduced by Koop et al. (1996) and Pesaran and Shin (1998). This framework has an advantage of order-invariance in com- parison with the Cholesky-based VAR variance decomposition in Diebold and Yilmaz (2009). Speciﬁcally, H-step-ahead error variance decomposition is calculated as θg ij(H) = σ−1 jj ∑H−1 h=0 (s′ iAhΣsj) 2 ∑H−1 h=0 (s′ iAhΣA′ hsi) × 100% (2.1) and normalised as ̃θg ij(H) = θg ij(H) ∑N j=1 θg ij(H) × 100%, (2.2) where g refers to the generalised variance decomposition method. Σ is the variance- covariance matrix of the error vector εt; σjj is the jth element of Σ; and si, sj are selection vectors, i.e., the i th element of si and jth element of sj are one, and all other elements are zero. Such a decomposition ̃θg ij(H) measures the fraction of the H-step-ahead error variance in forecasting variable xi that is due to exogenous shocks to variable xj. When i ̸= j, ̃θg ij(H) measures the spillover from xj to xi. Table 2.1 is a so-called spillover table introduced by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012). The upper left N × N block provides the H-step-ahead forecast error variance decom- position matrix. Based on this matrix, various spillover eﬀects can be examined and 33 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets will be explained in the following section. Table 2.1: Spillover table based on forecast error variance decomposition.

(2.1) and (2.2). Note that in this study, x1 to x5 represent daily price volatilities for the ﬁve regional markets in the Australian NEM. 2.3.2 Spillover measures In Table 2.1, the oﬀ-diagonal elements of this matrix ( ̃θg ij(H), i ̸= j) measure pairwise directional spillovers in gross levels. Hence the net directional spillover from market j to market i can be deﬁned as: Sg ij(H) = Sg i←j(H) − Sg j←i(H) = ̃θg ij(H) − ̃θg ji(H) (2.3) The oﬀ-diagonal row and column sums measure total gross directional spillovers re- ceived or transmitted by each market: Sg i←•(H) = N∑ j=1,j̸=i ̃θg ij(H), Sg •←j(H) = N∑ i=1,i̸=j ̃θg ij(H). (2.4) Next, by calculating the diﬀerence between gross spillovers transmitted from and re- ceived by a certain market i, the total net spillover from market i to all other markets is obtained: Sg i (H) = Sg •←i(H) − Sg i←•(H). (2.5) 34 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets Finally, an aggregated spillover index can be calculated where the sum of all oﬀ-diagonal elements is divided by the sum of all elements: Sg(H) = ∑N i,j=1;i̸=j ̃θg ij(H) ∑N i,j=1 ̃θg ij(H) = ∑N i,j=1;i̸=j ̃θg ij(H) N . (2.6) This index measures the overall degree of spillover eﬀects in the whole system. 2.4 The data Our study aims to measure spillover eﬀects between measures of daily price volatility for the ﬁve regional electricity markets in the NEM (NSW, QLD, SA, TAS and VIC). Our sample period is January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2017. Thus, our variable of interest, xi (i = 1, . . . , 5) denotes daily volatility estimates for each market i that are calculated on a daily basis, using Eqs. (2.7) and (2.8). For each day and market, we use 48 half-hourly spot price observations to calculate a daily measure of ‘realised’ price volatility. 3. Fig. 2.1 provides time series plots for the NEM spot prices. 4 Several common price trends and patterns of co-movement across the markets can be observed. First, during the period of the CPM (July 1, 2012 – June 30, 2014) there has been a signiﬁcant increase in spot electricity prices across all regions. Furthermore, since mid-2016, spot electricity prices as well as price volatilities have increased substantially in comparison 3 Half-hourly electricity spot prices are obtained from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) website, https://www.aemo.com.au/. It is worth noting that AEMO provides both 5-minute dispatch prices and half-hourly settlement prices. We use half-hourly prices in this study since these are the ﬁnal electricity prices used for settlement. Although 5-minute dispatch prices can have signiﬁcant variations within a half-hourly interval, as explained in Section 2.2, generators are paid half-hourly average prices. Therefore, those 5-minute variations could be eliminated or become insigniﬁcant in the ﬁnal settlement price. To illustrate, in the half-hourly interval from 15:00pm to 15:30pm on 27 January 2012 in QLD, the six dispatch prices exhibited signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations, which were ($948, -$22, $18, $157, -$586, $12). However, the ﬁnal settlement price was $88, which was only a mild spike compared to the mean price ($44.72) in QLD. 4 Note that we actually display weekly average prices calculated from half-hourly spot price observations in order to facilitate a visual inspection of common trends and patterns. Plots of the original half- hourly spot price series are provided in Section 2.A, Fig. 2.A.2 in Appendix. 35 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets to previous periods. Second, a high number price spikes are observed in each region, which, in many cases, appear in clusters. We also observe some spikes occurring at the same time in multiple regions. For example, prices in all regions except TAS displayed a substantial spike in the week starting on 24 January 2011. We apply two realised measures to estimate daily volatilities of electricity spot prices. The ﬁrst measure is the standard deviation of spot prices5,6 over the 48 half-hour intervals during each day, as represented in Eq. (2.7): SDt = √Σ K i=1(pit − ¯pt)2 K − 1 , (2.7) where SDt measures the market volatility on day t, pit is the half-hourly spot price for the i th half-hourly interval on day t, ¯pt is the average half-hourly price on day t, and K equals 48. The second measure is the daily range of prices that takes into account the highest and lowest price on a day: Ranget = Hight − Lowt, (2.8) where Hight and Lowt are the highest and lowest prices on day t, respectively7. With either of these two measures, the calculated volatility for each day is based on 5 We choose to use the standard deviation of prices as the volatility estimator rather than that of returns, because price-based functions have the advantage that they contain information on the present price level, and our analysis is also concerned with volatility during extreme price periods than volatility during low or normal price periods. For example, consider a low-price scenario where electricity price jumps from A$5/MWh to A$10/MWh and an extreme-price scenario where the price jumps from A$500/MWh to A$1000/MWh, both scenarios give a return of 100%; however, for electricity market participants, only the second scenario is of concern. In comparison, price-based measures are much less sensitive to these scenarios. In addition, as pointed out in Chan et al. (2008) and Ullrich (2012), ‘returns’ in the traditional sense do not exist in electricity markets because electricity is non-storable and thus cannot be used as a store of value. 6 Note that we also conducted the analysis by estimating volatility as the standard deviation of half- hourly price changes (i.e., pt − pt−1). Obtained results for this deﬁnition were very similar and are not reported here, but are available upon request. 7 This daily price range has been used as volatility estimator in, for example, Frömmel et al. (2014); Reboredo (2014); Auer (2016); Hansen and Huang (2016). It diﬀers from the original range-based estimator developed by Parkinson (1980) by not being scaled with the adjustment factor 4 ln 2. We omit the adjustment factor because this factor depends on the underlying data generating process (Patton, 2011; Frömmel et al., 2014), while the derivation of an appropriate adjustment factor for electricity market is beyond the scope of this study. 36 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets Fig. 2.1: Time series plots for electricity spot prices from 01 January 2010 to 31 December 2017. We plot weekly average prices calculated from half-hourly spot price observations in order to facilitate a visual inspection of common trends and patterns. Plots of the original half-hourly spot prices are provided in Fig. 2.A.2 in Section 2.A in Appendix. 37 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets intra-day prices for this day and we obtain a time series of daily price volatilities for each regional market (2,922 observations). The empirical results based on the two measures are very similar, suggesting that our spillover analysis is relatively robust to the choice of the volatility estimator 8. Fig. 2.2: Time series plots for estimated volatility (upper: SDt, bottom: log(SDt)) of electricity spot prices in NSW from 01 January 2010 to 31 December 2017. Plots for estimated volatility in the other regions in the NEM can be found in Fig. 2.A.3 and Fig. 2.A.4 in Appendix. Fig. 2.2 plots the estimated SDt and its logarithmic transform log(SDt) for NSW 9. As shown in the ﬁgure, the volatility exhibits patterns that are similar to those of spot electricity prices. First, periods of signiﬁcant volatility can be observed, which is con- sistent with prices as shown in Fig. 2.1. These short-lived high volatility periods tend to be mean-reverting and exhibit clusters during summer periods which are commonly high-demand periods in the NEM. Second, as can be observed in the bottom panel of Fig. 2.2, the volatility of electricity prices exhibits seasonal patterns and trends corre- 8 Since the results based on the two measures are very similar, most results reported in the following main text are generated with the ﬁrst measure (i.e., SD), while the results based on the second measure (i.e., Range) can be found in Section 2.B in Appendix or are available upon request to the authors. In particular, descriptive statistics for range-based volatility are reported in Table 2.B.1, pairwise correlations are then reported in Table 2.B.2, and spillover analysis results are presented in Table 2.B.3 and Fig. 2.B.1. 9 : Note that the volatility patterns for other regions in the NEM are similar to those for NSW and can be found in Fig. 2.A.3 and Fig. 2.A.4 in Appendix. 38 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets sponding to cyclical ﬂuctuations in electricity demand and long-term changes in market conditions. For example, daily volatility tends to be higher during the summer and winter months and on weekdays. Similar to spot prices that are displayed in Fig. 2.1, an increased volatility level is also observed since mid-2016. Interestingly, however, while prices in the NEM generally increased during the period of the CPM in Fig. 2.1, price volatility remained at a similar level compared to previous periods. Note that in order to account for the seasonality of electricity market data, we also conducted the analysis based on deseasonalised price volatilities where a wavelet smoothing is applied to remove the seasonal component. Results based on deseasonalised volatilities are qualitatively similar and can be found in Section 2.B in the Appendix. Table 2.2 further presents descriptive statistics for electricity price volatilities (SD) and log-volatility (log(SD)) for each regional market in the Australian NEM. Note that since the calculated volatility time series are positively skewed and strongly lep- tokurtic, following Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) we take the natural logarithm of these series to obtain approximate normality. The applied transformation is helpful not only because of the superior statistical properties of the normal distribution, but also be- cause normality is invoked by generalised variance decompositions (Koop et al., 1996; Pesaran and Shin, 1998) that are applied in the following spillover analysis. After the natural logarithm transformation, the skewness and kurtosis of volatility are largely reduced 10. In addition, the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) statistics suggest that for all volatility series a unit root can be rejected at the 1% signiﬁcance level, i.e., each series is stationary. In the following, we will concentrate 10 It is important to note that for most regional markets the daily SD series are not normally distributed. Even after a logarithmic transformation the log(SD) series still exhibit skewness and excess kurtosis. To address this issue, we generated approximately normally distributed time series. In particular, we ﬁrst applied a cap (three intraday standard deviations) to the half-hourly price series before calculating the daily SD, to reduce the impact of large intraday spikes. Next, instead of a logarithm transformation, we applied a Box-Cox power transformation (Box and Cox, 1964) to the SD series. As illustrated in Section 2.C – Table 2.C.1 in Appendix, the obtained series did not violate normality based on conducted Jaque-Bera tests (at the 5% level of signiﬁcance). In a next step, we then repeated the conducted spillover analysis for the outlier-ﬁltered and Box-Cox-transformed daily SD series. We found that the results for the transformed SD series were qualitatively similar to our original results. Results for the conducted static spillover analysis (Table 2.C.2) and the calculated dynamic aggregate spillover index (Fig. 2.C.1) are reported in Section 2.C in Appendix. Additional results for the outlier-ﬁltered and Box-Cox-transformed series are not reported here, but available upon request to the authors. 39 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets on log-volatility data. According to Table 2.2, among the ﬁve markets in the NEM, price volatility in SA has the highest mean and median values, indicating that the electricity market in SA is the most volatile. The relatively high penetration of wind generation in SA can be considered as one of the factors contributing to this high volatility, because of the intermittent nature of wind energy. Other market conditions in SA also contribute to volatile prices, including a relatively high concentration of generator ownership, strategic rebidding by generators aiming for more favourable electricity prices, and the tight demand-supply balance due to limited import capacity and the recent withdrawal of thermal power plant (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017). QLD is also a relatively volatile market, due to the high concentration level in its electricity generation sector as well as rebidding by generators in recent years.

The null hypothesis is rejected for a given signiﬁcance level when the test statistic is less than the corresponding critical value (-2.57 (10%), -2.86 (5%) and -3.44 (1%)). Table 2.3 reports pairwise correlations (Pearson correlation coeﬃcients) between log- volatilities (log(SD)) over the sample period. It provides an initial idea of the connect- edness among diﬀerent regional markets in the NEM. Overall, all pairwise correlations are positive; and higher correlations are typically found between regions where there 40 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets are direct interconnections (e.g., NSW and VIC, VIC and SA, and VIC and TAS). In contrast, the lowest correlation coeﬃcients can be observed between regions that are geographically distant and not physically connected (e.g., QLD and TAS, and QLD and SA). Interestingly, although there are two interconnectors in place between QLD and NSW, the volatility correlation between these two markets is lower in comparison to the other markets with direct interconnection. Since the interaction and transmission of shocks between markets in reality might be far more complex than what can be captured by a simple correlation analysis (for example, these eﬀects have directions and may vary over time), in the following, we will further investigate volatility transmission by analysing speciﬁc patterns of spillover eﬀects across the NEM.

Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets 2.5.1 Model speciﬁcation As the ﬁrst step of our spillover analysis, the speciﬁcation of a VAR model is required. Overall, there are three main parameters to be determined: the optimal lag length (p) of the VAR model, the forecasting horizon (H) in the VAR forecast error variance decomposition, as well as the choice of window length (w) for the dynamic spillover analysis. A VAR model with two lags (p = 2) is selected based on Bayesian (Schwarz) information criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978). However, alternative choices of p will also be assessed in the robustness check section. The choice of the forecasting horizon H in variance decompositions allows us to decide whether ‘long-run’ or ‘short-run’ spillover eﬀects are to be assessed. As H length- ens, the conditioning information in the short run is becoming less valuable; and an unconditional variance decomposition will be obtained if H → ∞ (Diebold and Yil- maz, 2014). In this study we choose H = 1 (the forecast horizon used by AEMO for pre-dispatch forecast(Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019)) because we are more interested in short-term volatility transmissions in highly volatile electricity markets 12, while a longer forecasting horizon is used for robustness assessment. In order to track time variations of volatility spillover eﬀects, a rolling-window approach is employed. In particular, a one sided estimation window is used to sweep through the entire sample. In each window, a VAR model is estimated and spillover measures are calculated so that time series data can be generated and indexed by the end date of each window. In each window, the lag length (p) is decided based on BIC 13. We 12 As explained in Diebold and Yilmaz (2014), the selection of H usually relates to speciﬁc considerations in certain contexts. For example, for equity markets, H = 10 which corresponds to the 10-day Value-at- Risk required by the Basel Capital Accord is commonly used in a risk management context. Similarly, H might be related to the rebalancing period in a portfolio management context. In electricity markets, spillover eﬀects estimated with H = 1 are of greater interest because the level of electricity price and volatility can change signiﬁcantly within a very short period of time. In addition, in many electricity markets around the world generators typically submit bids one day ahead. 13 The choice of optimal window length w reﬂects a trade-oﬀ between the reliability of the estimated results and the amount of information obtained. On the one hand, a longer window will provide more robust estimates. On the other hand, by using a window with less observations, the provided 42 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets choose a window length w = 365 days (one calendar year) in the main analysis, but also use a shorter window (180 days) and a longer window (540 days) to examine the robustness of the results. 2.5.2 Static spillover analysis Results for a conducted static spillover analysis for price volatility (log(SD) and log(Range)) in the Australian NEM are reported in Table 2.4. As can be observed in Table 2.4, the results based on the two volatility measures are qualitatively similar. The following spillover analyses thus are only based on the results for log(SD). Table 2.4: Spillovers eﬀects (measured in percentage) based on daily log-volatility for the entire sample period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2017. A negative sign for ‘Net to Others’, see, e.g., QLD in Panels (a) and (b), indicates that the market is a net receiver of volatility spillover.

Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets The aggregated index (35.92%) shown in the lower right corner of Table 2.4 measures the degree of volatility spillover eﬀects at a system-wide level. The interpretation of this result suggests that 35.92% of the one-day-ahead forecast error variance for the entire market can be attributed to spillover eﬀects. At the same time, a signiﬁcantly higher proportion (100% - 35.92% = 64.08%) is due to shocks within each of the regional markets. It indicates that it is typically the local factor that dominates the volatility in a market. In comparison to results reported in the literature for equity markets, the calculated volatility spillover index for the NEM is lower than the one reported in Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) for nineteen global stock markets (40%) and in Zhang and Wang (2014) for three oil markets (China, the US and UK, 43.3%). It is also signiﬁcantly lower than the spillover index reported for thirteen major US ﬁnancial institutions’ stocks (78.3%) (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014). The estimated index is also lower compared with a value of the index of 52.445% in Apergis et al. (2017) for the NEM, excluding TAS. In terms of pairwise volatility spillover eﬀects, the highest level of spillover can be observed from VIC to SA (Sg SA←V IC = 24.04%). The spillover from SA to VIC is also relatively high (Sg V IC←SA = 21.00%). However, the diﬀerence between these two indicates that net spillover is from VIC to SA, rather than from SA to VIC. High spillover eﬀects can also be observed between NSW and VIC (Sg N SW ←V IC = 22.44%, Sg V IC←N SW = 15.82%). In contrast, much lower pairwise volatility spillovers are ob- served between QLD and TAS (Sg T AS←QLD = Sg QLD←T AS = 1.22%), and between QLD and SA (Sg SA←QLD = 1.12%, Sg QLD←SA = 1.69%). Overall, as expected, greater spillover eﬀects are observed between adjoining markets that are physically connected. In particular, spillovers between the pairs SA–VIC (two interconnectors) and NSW–VIC (one interconnector) are of high magnitude. Relatively high spillovers can also be observed between the pairs NSW–QLD (two interconnectors) and TAS–VIC (one interconnector). In contrast, spillovers between geographically dis- tant and unconnected markets are signiﬁcantly lower (e.g., QLD–TAS and QLD–SA). This indicates the important role of interconnectors in facilitating price convergence 44 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets and integration between regional markets and conﬁrms the ﬁndings in Higgs (2009), Smith (2015) and Ignatieva and Trück (2016). With regards to gross directional spillovers shown in the ‘To Others’ row and the ‘From Others’ column of Table 2.4, the major transmitters are VIC (Sg •←V IC = 65.49%), NSW (Sg •←N SW = 43.15%) and SA (Sg •←SA=38.35%). These three regions are also the major gross spillover receivers in the NEM (Sg V IC←• = 47.77%, Sg N SW ←• = 44.80%, Sg SA←•=37.64%). Although VIC is not the most volatile market in the NEM, it is the most signiﬁcant volatility spillover transmitter and receiver according to Table 2.4, possibly due to its large electricity consumption, its high degree of interconnection with other regions, and its relatively high share of generation and export of electricity to other markets. VIC is directly connected to three other regional markets with four interconnectors in place. The aggregated interconnector capacity for interregional electricity transmission to and from VIC is the highest among all regions in the NEM (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2017a). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect VIC to have the highest connectedness and spillover eﬀects with other regional markets. The high spillovers to and from NSW could be explained in a similar way. As the largest regional market in the NEM, there are three interconnectors with a relatively high capacity between NSW and two other regions. For SA, the high gross spillover eﬀects are not surprising because of the extremely high price volatility in this region, which is largely due to high reliance on wind generation and the intermittent nature of wind power. In contrast, relatively low gross spillover eﬀects are observed for QLD and TAS, indicat- ing lower connectedness between either of these two regions and others. Particularly, spillovers from and to QLD are both the lowest (Sg •←QLD=14.50%, Sg QLD←•=23.12%), while its own shocks (Sg QLD←QLD) explain 76.88% of the forecast error variance. A possible reason for this may be the market structure in QLD: the electricity generation sector in QLD is more concentrated than in any other region in the NEM (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017) such that the high degree of local generator market power makes QLD relatively isolated from other markets. 45 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets Regarding the ‘Net’ row, for each market, positive net spillovers for a market indi- cate that spillover eﬀects transmitted by that market are higher than spillover eﬀects received by it, while negative net spillovers for a market suggest that spillover ef- fects transmitted by that market are lower than spillover eﬀects received. Only VIC (17.72%) is a signiﬁcant net volatility spillover transmitter, while NSW (-1.65%), QLD (-8.62%) and TAS (-8.16%) all receive net spillovers from others. Net spillovers for SA (0.71%) are close to zero. The highest net spillover for VIC indicates that this market is the most inﬂuential in the NEM. In contrast, net spillovers transmitted by QLD and TAS are the lowest, indicating that QLD and TAS are the least inﬂuential market. This is not surprising because QLD is a highly independent and concentrated market while TAS is the smallest market in the NEM and relatively distant from other regions, connected only to VIC through a submarine cable. Overall, we ﬁnd diﬀerent results in comparison to Apergis et al. (2017), the empirical study most related to ours. For the studied sample period from 2010-2017, we ﬁnd spillover eﬀects that are lower in comparison to those reported in Apergis et al. (2017). Furthermore, the net spillover positions for QLD, SA and VIC in our study are reversed to those reported in Apergis et al. (2017). Particularly, while Apergis et al. (2017) ﬁnd that NSW is the most signiﬁcant gross spillover transmitter/receiver and SA is the most signiﬁcant net spillover transmitter, our results suggest that VIC is the market with the highest level of spillover transmission both in terms of gross and net spillovers. Refer to Section 2.F in Appendix for a more detailed comparison. As documented by Ullrich (2012), the frequency of data measurement has a signiﬁcant impact on realised volatility measures. The diﬀerences in results could be largely driven by the diﬀerence in the applied volatility measures based on 5-minute and 30-minute price intervals. A net connectedness network graph is provided in Fig. 2.D.1 in Section 2.D in Appendix, which visualises the directional spillovers across regions in the NEM. 46 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets 2.5.3 Dynamic spillover analysis The analysis based on the full-sample in the previous section has provided a summary of the average pattern of spillover eﬀects in the Australian NEM. This analysis is static be- cause it implies an assumption that spillover eﬀects remain constant across the sample. However, during our sample period from January 2010 to December 2017, a number of events occurred in the Australian NEM that could be expected to impact on spillovers across the markets. These events include long-term evolutions, such as changes in mar- ket policies and structures, and also extraordinary short-term events, such as extreme weather, temporary generation outages and transmission failures. These changes or market events are likely to cause variations in spillover eﬀects over time. Therefore, it may be inadequate to assume that spillovers are time-invariant. Thus, in the following sections, a series of dynamic analyses are conducted. 2.5.3.1 Aggregated spillover analysis Fig. 2.3 plots the time-varying aggregated volatility spillover index based on the two volatility measures with a 365-day rolling window. Since the results based on the two measures are very similar, only log(SD)-based results (Fig. 2.3 Panel A) are discussed. As shown in the ﬁgure, the overall degree of volatility spillover eﬀects in the NEM is not constant but time-varying, which can largely deviate from the average (static) level (35.92%). Initiated at 35% in the ﬁrst window, the spillover index ranges from 25% to 45% across the sample period. Two major patterns can be observed from those time variations, which are described as follows. First, some signiﬁcant upward movements of the spillover index could be related to certain market events. In particular, the shaded areas in Fig. 2.3 indicate periods when extraordinary market events (Events A to S) are recorded in the NEM according to the Australian Energy Regulator (2017). These events typically include extremely high demand, congestion of interconnectors and generation outages. The spillover plots are 47 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets found to indicate responses to these market events. More precisely, the spillover index tends to jump during major market events, reﬂecting a higher likelihood of joint price spikes and high price volatility in diﬀerent regions during signiﬁcant market events. They typically drop once the rolling sample window leaves the period of events behind, given the absence of other shocks. Second, volatility spillovers in the NEM appear to be impacted signiﬁcantly by the CPM. The level of aggregated volatility spillover in the NEM was generally lower during the carbon pricing period than during the periods before and after. In particular, before the introduction of the carbon tax policy, the spillover index mostly stayed between 35% and 45%, except that the index experienced a signiﬁcant drop from around 42.5% to 26% before the establishment of carbon pricing in Australia (January 2012 – June 2012). When the carbon tax was in place, the spillover index generally ﬂuctuated within a lower band between 25% and 35%, except for a short period around the beginning of 2013 when the index was slightly higher. After the abolishment of the carbon tax, the spillover index typically ﬂuctuated above 35%, in the range from 32% to 43%. A possible reason for this pattern is the non-even impact of the CPM on diﬀerent regions, which is also discussed in Apergis et al. (2016). For example, electricity prices in NSW, QLD and VIC were more sensitive to the CPM due to their reliance on coal-based generation, while prices in TAS were most insensitive due to its large share of hydropower. These divergent reactions of regional prices might have lowered the connectedness and convergence level between regions, and thus the overall volatility transmission in the NEM during the CPM period. Finally, our results also suggest that between the end of the CPM period and 2017 the system-wide aggregate volatility spillovers have increased. This increase may be a result of the shut-down of several coal-ﬁred power plants in NSW, SA, and VIC. This signiﬁcant reduction in baseload generation and reserve capacity has led to more periods of extreme price and volatility, but has also increased the importance of inter- regional trade across the markets. Overall, such a market setup is likely to lead to a higher level of volatility spillover as illustrated by Fig. 2.3. 48 Chapter 2.

Shaded areas (A to S) represent recorded events in the NEM according to the Australian Energy Regulator (2017), which are speciﬁed as follows: A: record demand (NSW and SA); B: outages of the Basslink interconnector (VIC and TAS); C: high demand (SA and VIC); D: congestion (QLD); E: temporary shutdown and tight supply conditions (SA); F: high demand and rebidding (SA), high demand and network issue (NSW); G: high demand (SA and VIC); H: rebidding (QLD); I: record demand (QLD); J: tight supply conditions and rebidding (SA); K: network issues (NSW); L: tight supply and rebidding (SA); M: high demand (NSW, QLD, SA, VIC); N: Heywood outage and low wind (SA); O: blackout (SA); P: network constraints (NSW and VIC); Q: Heywood outage (SA and VIC); R: high demand (NSW, QLD, SA) and SA blackout; S: Hazelwood closure (VIC) 49 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets 2.5.3.2 Net directional spillover analysis We now investigate dynamic spillovers (log(SD)-based) and their directions for par- ticular regional markets in the NEM. Panel A of Fig. 2.4 plots time variations of total net directional volatility spillovers contributed by each of the ﬁve regional markets in the NEM, corresponding to the dynamic estimation of the ‘Net’ row of the spillover table (Table 2.4). Panel B of Fig. 2.4 provides the time-varying plots of pairwise net volatility spillovers between each pair of regional markets. Fig. 2.4 indicates that both the degree and direction of spillover eﬀects are not constant but clearly exhibit some variation through time. Some major events in the NEM are still reﬂected by signiﬁcant upward or downward jumps in net directional spillover plots. Furthermore, directional spillover plots allow us to observe the inﬂuence of a certain event on each particular market. In the following, the dynamic pattern of total net spillovers for each market is discussed together with pairwise net spillovers, since pairwise net spillovers can be viewed as decompositions of the total net directional spillovers. 50 Chapter 2.

Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets Although NSW was identiﬁed as a net volatility spillover receiver in the static analysis, dynamic plots of net spillovers in Fig. 2.4, Panel A indicate that NSW was typically a net transmitter across the sample period. In addition, this net position changed through time, which could not be captured by the static analysis. There were two episodes (over the year 2014 and most of 2016) during which NSW received signiﬁcant net volatility spillovers from other markets. Particularly, Fig. 2.4, Panel B shows that during the year 2014, net spillovers received by NSW mainly came from SA and VIC. This episode could be relevant to the high electricity demand in NSW, SA and VIC around the beginning of 2014 (Events F and G in Fig. 2.3) when extremely hot weather was recorded. After the inﬂuence of these events disappeared around the beginning of 2015, NSW moved back to being a net spillover transmitter. Similar patterns and causes were also observed in 2016. During other periods, NSW mainly received net volatility spillovers from VIC and transmitted net spillovers to QLD, SA and TAS. This indicates that based on a pairwise comparison, NSW is typically more inﬂuential than QLD, SA and TAS, but less inﬂuential than VIC. QLD was a net volatility spillover receiver (Fig. 2.4, Panel A) throughout the entire sample period. Noticeably, the magnitude of net spillovers received by QLD was much higher during 2011 (mainly between 10% and 20%) than during the period between 2012 and 2016, where it was around 5%. These net spillovers to QLD mainly came from NSW and VIC (Fig. 2.4, Panel B). Similarly, their magnitudes also were signiﬁcantly reduced from the beginning of 2012. A possible reason for this could be the integration of two local generators in QLD in 2011 (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017), which has increased the degree of QLD electricity market concentration. SA was typically a net volatility spillover receiver over the sample period, except for 2014 and the second half of 2016, when the market transmitted net spillovers to others (Fig. 2.4, Panel A)). Similar to the case of NSW, this reversion of net spillover position could be related to the high demand in NSW, SA and VIC around the beginning of 2014 and lower wind generation in SA in the second half of 2016. According to Fig. 2.4, Panel B, the positive net volatility spillover transmitted by SA mainly impacted on 53 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets NSW and TAS. Meanwhile, VIC also received low but positive net spillovers from SA in 2014. During other periods, SA mainly received net spillover eﬀects transmitted VIC. Similar to QLD, TAS was also a net volatility spillover receiver (Fig. 2.4, Panel A) throughout the sample period, receiving spillover eﬀects mainly from VIC but also NSW (Fig. 2.4, Panel B). While net spillovers received by TAS were generally below 10%, its degree kept increasing to 20% since the CPM period began to enter the rolling window. After the inﬂuence of carbon tax disappeared in the second half of 2015, net spillover received by TAS decreased signiﬁcantly. This reﬂects the fact that TAS exported a large amount of electricity during 2012-2014 due to the price advantage of its hydro generation. Throughout the sample period VIC was always classiﬁed as a net volatility spillover transmitter, while net spillovers transmitted from VIC were generally higher than those for other markets (Fig. 2.4, Panel A). For the pairwise analysis (Fig. 2.4, Panel B), VIC typically had a positive net spillover position, indicating a higher inﬂuence in comparison to any of the other four markets. Overall, the provided net directional spillover plots suggest that VIC is the most in- ﬂuential market with regards to spillover eﬀects. NSW and SA also exert signiﬁcant inﬂuence on other markets during certain subperiods with positive net spillover posi- tions. In contrast, QLD and TAS appear to have the lowest impact on spillovers and always receive a net transmission of volatility shocks from other markets. Additionally, two patterns are worth noticing. First, although most ﬁndings based on Table 2.4 are supported by the time-varying net spillover plots, there are clear diﬀerences between the static and dynamic analysis (e.g., for NSW) since the dynamic analysis is based on a rolling window with smaller sample size. Second, certain extraordinary events can reverse the direction of net spillover eﬀects, which could be observed, for example, for NSW and SA at the beginning of 2014. 54 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets 2.5.4 Spillovers for peak and oﬀ-peak periods In this section, we investigate the diﬀerence in the volatility spillover eﬀects for peak and oﬀ-peak hours. Speciﬁcally, price volatilities (log(SD)) for peak and oﬀ-peak periods are modeled: following AEMO (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2017a), the peakload period is deﬁned as the hours from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm for weekdays (excluding NEM holidays) when electricity demand and spot prices are generally higher. The oﬀ-peak period refers to the remaining hours, i.e., 10:00 pm – 7:00 am for weekdays as well as all hours during NEM holidays and weekends14. Estimated static volatility spillovers for peak and oﬀ-peak hours are presented in Ta- ble 2.5. Overall, both spillovers for peak and oﬀ-peak periods exhibit some similarities with volatility spillovers for the baseload period as shown in Table 2.4. Thus, pairwise spillover eﬀects are higher between interconnected markets and lower between distant markets and markets that are not directly connected. Meanwhile, VIC and NSW, the two regional markets which are most highly connected to the rest of the network, and SA which is the most volatile market, are the most signiﬁcant gross spillover transmit- ters and receivers. Despite the above similarities, notable diﬀerences between spillovers for peak and oﬀ- peak hours can be observed. First, the aggregated spillover index is higher for peakload periods (41.13%) than for oﬀ-peak (36.61%) and baseload (35.92% - see Table 2.4) periods. This suggests a generally higher level of transmission of volatility shocks during peak hours, when demand is typically higher and closer to reserve capacity of the markets. Since price spikes are also more likely to occur during peak hours, this result could be expected. Furthermore, the analysis on net directional spillovers shows that the inﬂuence of the 14 Our analysis in Section 2.5.4 compares spillover eﬀects for three diﬀerent periods of the day/week: peak hours, oﬀ-peak hours and baseload. As explained, peak and oﬀ-peak periods are non-overlapping, distinguishing between business hours and before/after-work hours, weekdays and weekends/holidays. In contrast, the term baseload refers to all hours of electricity consumption, i.e. 00:00am Mon- day to 24:00pm Sunday as deﬁned in https://www.asx.com.au/documents/products/asx24-contract- speciﬁcations.pdf. 55 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets regional markets on volatility spillovers in the NEM is diﬀerent for peak and oﬀ-peak hours. While VIC is a signiﬁcant volatility spillover transmitter in both periods, NSW is the most signiﬁcant net transmitter of spillover eﬀects during oﬀ-peak hours and a net volatility receiver during peak hours. The signiﬁcant inﬂuence of NSW and VIC during oﬀ-peak hours can be explained by the dominant share of coal-ﬁred generation in these two markets as well as by their strong interconnection with the rest of the network. The diﬀerence between NSW and VIC for the peak hours, on the other hand, is consistent with the fact that NSW is generally a net electricity importer and therefore more reliant on electricity generated in VIC during peakload periods when local supply is insuﬃcient. SA is another notable regional market. It is a net spillover receiver for oﬀ-peak hours but a net spillover transmitter for peak hours. This observation could be explained by the local generation mix in SA. Given the high proportion of wind generation in SA, the signiﬁcant diﬀerence between intermittent generation from wind and baseload generation (large coal) results in a lower level of connectedness between SA and other markets during oﬀ-peak hours. Meanwhile, the intermittent nature of wind generation makes SA the most volatile and spike-prone market in the NEM during peakload periods, resulting in SA being a net spillover transmitter during peak hours. 56 Chapter 2.

The ijth entry estimates the fraction of one-day ahead error variance in forecasting market i due to exogenous shocks to market j (i.e., the spillover from market j to market i: Sg ij). Fig. 2.5 compares the dynamic behavior of the aggregated spillover index for peak hours (Panel A) and oﬀ-peak hours(Panel B). Consistent with the static spillover analysis, the aggregated volatility spillover index is generally higher for peakload periods than for oﬀ-peak and baseload (Fig. 2.3) periods. For daily volatilities based on peak hours only, the index ﬂuctuates between 32% and 51% with an average value of 40%, while for oﬀ-peak volatility estimates the spillover index has a range of 20% - 49% and an average value of 32%. A noteworthy observation is also the diﬀerent impact of the CPM on the aggregated volatility spillover index for peak and oﬀ-peak hours. Speciﬁcally, the impact of the CPM on spillover eﬀects as discussed in Section 2.5.3.1 appear to be more pronounced for oﬀ-peak volatility estimates. When the CPM was in place, volatility spillover 57 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets for oﬀ-peak hours was generally lower compared to the pre-tax and post-tax periods. In comparison, spillover eﬀects for volatility that is calculated based on peak hours remained relatively high for the majority of the carbon tax period and only decreased towards the end of the CPM period. This observation around the CPM could be expected, since baseload generation (mainly from high-emitting coal-ﬁred power plants) was more aﬀected by the CPM than peakload generation with a large proportion of gas-ﬁred generation.

Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets 2.5.5 Robustness assessment Finally, we investigate the robustness of our results, including the reliability of our ﬁndings with regard to the impacts of the CPM and diﬀerent choices of parameters for the applied model. 2.5.5.1 Spillovers in sub-periods In this section, the static spillover analysis is conducted separately for four sub-periods: these sub-periods include the period before the implementation of the carbon pricing mechanism (July 2010 to June 2012), the period when the tax was eﬀective (July 2012 to June 2014), the post-tax period (July 2014 to June 2016), and the period when prices in the NEM were signiﬁcantly higher compared to those in previous years (July 2016 to December 2017) (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2017a). Results for each of these sub-periods are presented in Table 2.6. The aggregated volatility spillover indices for the four sub-periods are 34.74%, 32.27%, 37.47% and 38.93%, respectively. This conﬁrms our earlier ﬁndings that the aggre- gated volatility spillover index was slightly lower during the tax period, in comparison to pre- and post-tax periods. In addition, during the last sub-period, when prices in the NEM were generally spiky and volatile, we also ﬁnd higher levels of aggregated volatil- ity spillover. For each sub-period, higher degrees of spillover were observed between adjoining and interconnected markets, while signiﬁcantly lower spillovers were found between distant and unconnected markets. Regarding gross directional spillovers, in each sub-period, NSW, SA and VIC were still major gross volatility spillover transmit- ters and receivers. In addition, it is observed in Table 2.6 that for QLD, gross spillovers from and to others in the ﬁrst and last sub-periods (Panels (a) and (d)) were signiﬁ- cantly higher than those in the following two sub-periods (Panels (b) and (c)). This conﬁrms our ﬁnding that the overall connectedness between QLD and other markets in the NEM has been reduced since 2012 till 2016, but started to increase again towards 59 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets the end of the sample period. In net terms, Table 2.6 conﬁrms that the net direction of spillover eﬀects can change in diﬀerent sub-periods (e.g., SA). Meanwhile, although NSW was a net spillover receiver based on the full sample in Table 2.4, Panel (a), for all sub-periods it was classiﬁed as a net transmitter. During the CPM period, net spillovers transmitted by NSW sub- stantially decreased, while self-spillovers (Sg N SW ←N SW ) increased. One possible reason for this was NSW’s increased local hydro generation and reduced reliance on import (Australian Energy Regulator, 2017) when the tax was in place. Additionally, it is noteworthy that on average, net spillovers received by TAS during the CPM period were around twice the degree of those before and after the carbon pricing. This indi- cates that increased electricity imports of other markets from TAS during the carbon tax period (as discussed in Section 2.2) resulted in a higher net inﬂuence exerted by other markets on TAS. In summary, the separate assessment of volatility spillover eﬀects in the NEM for dif- ferent sub-periods conﬁrms empirical ﬁndings of this study presented in Sections 2.5.2 and 2.5.3. Our results also conﬁrm the ability of dynamic spillover plots to continu- ously track the changes in spillover levels through time. The dynamics of directional spillovers across the four sub-periods are also reﬂected through the visualisation of con- nectedness networks. We provide these connectedness network plots for sub-periods in Fig. 2.D.2 in Section 2.D in Appendix. 60 Chapter 2.

Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets 2.5.5.2 Alternative model speciﬁcation Finally, we assess the robustness of our ﬁndings to diﬀerent model and parameter speciﬁcations. First we examine alternative choices of the identiﬁcation method of shocks in the forecast error variance decomposition. In addition, diﬀerent choices of the lag length p for the VAR model, the forecasting horizon H, and the rolling window length w were examined. The robustness of our results to the choice of the shock identiﬁcation method is as- sessed by comparing the original decomposition approach of Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) (DY09) with the method proposed in (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012) (DY12) that is em- ployed in the main analysis of this study. The 2009 version of the DY method uses a Cholesky decomposition to identify shocks, while the 2012 version uses a generalised variance decomposition (GVD). Fig. 2.6 plots the aggregated volatility spillover index generated by the two versions of the DY method. Recall that the Cholesky decomposition is sensitive to the variable ordering; therefore, for the 2009 version, we employ a ‘fast spillover method’ developed by Klößner and Wagner (2014) to compute the results for all possible orderings in each window 15, and show the intervals between the minimum and maximum values of the spillover index in the plots. Overall, the dynamics of the spillover indices generated by the two versions of the DY method are quite similar. However, the aggregated spillover index obtained from the DY12 method is at a higher level than that obtained from the DY09 method. This is because the generalised forecast error variance decomposition treats each variable as the ﬁrst variable in the Cholesky decomposition and thus tends to yield higher estimates for spillover eﬀects (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014; Klößner and Wagner, 2014). Overall we ﬁnd that the DY12 approach generates a systematically higher estimation of aggregate spillovers compared to DY09. The diﬀerence is on average 12%, ranging from 8% to 16%. However, it should be noted that the individual elements of the spillover 15 ‘FastSOM’ R package is provided by Klößner and Wagner (2016). 62 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets table (pairwise spillovers) do not exhibit such a clear pattern, which is consistent with ﬁndings documented by Klößner and Wagner (2013). Fig. 2.6: Robustness of the results to the choice of the identiﬁcation method, based on log(SD). The solid line refers to the spillover indices calculated from a generalised variance decomposition (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012). The gray band corresponds to a interval between the minimum and maximum values of the spillover index calculated from a Cholesky decomposition (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2009) based on all possible orderings. DY09 (average) is the average value of calculated spillover indices based on all possible orderings for the Cholesky decomposition. Finally, we examine the robustness of our results for diﬀerent choices of the lag length p in the applied VAR model, the forecasting horizon H, and the length w of the rolling window. Overall, we ﬁnd that the obtained spillover patterns are quite robust to the choice of lag length or forecasting horizon. With regards to the length of the rolling window, as expected the identiﬁed spillover eﬀects exhibit higher variation for a shorter window length and are more stable for a longer rolling window choice. More details on the results for conducted robustness checks are provided in Section 2.E in Appendix. 2.6 Conclusions This study provides a detailed examination of volatility spillover eﬀects for ﬁve re- gional markets in the Australian NEM, based on a sample period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2017. In particular, we empirically assess volatility spillover eﬀects, 63 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets including their degree, direction between regions, time variation, and the impacts of changing market conditions on these eﬀects, applying spillover indices that were origi- nally proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012). We ﬁnd that for the entire sample period, the degree of a system-wide aggregated volatility spillover index for the NEM is 35.92%. Interestingly, despite several existing interconnectors between the regional markets, the overall level of volatility spillover across electricity spot markets seems to be lower than results typically reported for equity and other ﬁnancial markets. Our interpretation of these results is that in com- parison to other ﬁnancial markets, for electricity spot markets, a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of volatility is due to market-speciﬁc factors and shocks within each region. Thus, while volatility spillover eﬀects across markets seem to play an important role, regional market volatility is still dominated by local eﬀects. We also ﬁnd that the degree of volatility spillover is time-varying. During the CPM period from July 2012 to June 2014, spillovers are typically lower, possibly due to a diﬀerent impact of the tax on regions with a higher share of fossil fuels (NSW, QLD and VIC) and those with a higher share of renewables (SA and TAS). Furthermore, our results suggest that between 2014 and 2017 system-wide aggregate volatility spillovers have increased, what may be a result of less reserve capacity in several regional markets, increased inter-regional trade and more extreme prices and volatility across all markets. Regarding the direction of volatility spillovers, we ﬁnd that VIC, NSW and SA can be classiﬁed as major volatility spillover transmitters and receivers, suggesting a higher importance and level of connectedness with other regions in the NEM for these markets. Interestingly, VIC is the only consistent net spillover transmitter, indicating that VIC exerts the highest relative inﬂuence on other markets. This is in line with VIC’s high share of electricity generation from fossil fuels, resulting in typically lower price levels and its high share of electricity exports to other markets such as NSW and SA. However, we ﬁnd that the direction of spillover eﬀects across diﬀerent regions is time- varying: NSW and SA exhibit both periods where the markets can be classiﬁed as net spillover transmitter or net spillover receivers. On the other hand, VIC is a permanent 64 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets net spillover transmitter, while QLD and TAS are net receivers throughout the entire sample period. These results indicate the systemic importance of VIC in the NEM. We also ﬁnd that the patterns of spillover eﬀects could be related to speciﬁc market events and market structures. In particular, some periods of increased spillover eﬀects correspond to signiﬁcant market events, such as extreme demand, congestion of trans- mission lines, and generation outages. In addition to the magnitude, certain extraor- dinary market events also change the direction of spillovers between diﬀerent regions. Meanwhile, factors such as the generation mix, electricity consumption, market policy and interregional electricity trade also exert inﬂuence on spillover eﬀects. Spillover eﬀects also exhibit diﬀerent patterns for daily volatilities calculated for baseload, peak- load and oﬀ-peak hours. Furthermore, interconnectors are found to play an important role in facilitating higher connectedness and integration levels between regional markets through greater spillover eﬀects. Finally, our results are robust when separate assessments are conducted for sub-periods with regard to the introduction and repeal of the Australian CPM. Our results are also robust to the choice of model speciﬁcation such as the shock identiﬁcation method, the lag length of the applied VAR model, the predictive horizon for the forecast error variance decomposition, and with some limitations also to the length of the rolling- window. Overall, our results suggest that the framework by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012) is well suited to capture spillover dynamics across a system of wholesale electricity spot markets. Our results provide important insights for market participants, especially for those who simultaneously operate in diﬀerent regional markets in the NEM. In particu- lar we provide an analysis of the transfer of risks between the considered highly volatile markets. Compared to the previous literature on Australian electricity markets, using a more recent sample period also allows us to consider the inﬂuence of the CPM period on volatility spillover eﬀects in the NEM. Our analysis therefore provides regulators with information on how climate change policies impact volatility transmission and the overall stability of the NEM. In addition, the conducted spillover analysis will enable 65 Chapter 2. Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets regulators to examine the impacts of the current market structure on volatility trans- missions across regions. This is of signiﬁcance for making investment decisions on, for example, the shut-down of major coal-ﬁred power plants, the inclusion of renewables and, in particular investment into new generation plants and interconnectors. 66 References References Aderounmu, A.A., Wolﬀ, R., 2014a.

All results are based on log(SD) as volatility measure. Next to the original determined lag length p = 2, we examine alternative lag lengths p = 1, p = 7 and p = 14 in the applied VAR model, i.e., referring to one day, one week and two weeks. The results are provided in Fig. 2.E.1. Overall, we ﬁnd that the dynamic behaviour of the aggregated spillover index is very similar for diﬀerent choices of p. Choice of Forecasting Horizon H In addition to a one-day horizon in the forecast error variance decomposition, we con- sider a 7-day horizon (one week ahead, also used as AEMO’s short-term demand fore- cast (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019)), a 14-day horizon (two weeks ahead, generally used by papers which apply the DY framework, see, e.g., Diebold and Yilmaz (2014); Apergis et al. (2017); Luo and Ji (2018); Singh et al. (2019)) and a 30-day hori- zon (one month ahead, another commonly used horizon in the electricity forecasting literature, see, e.g., Pao (2006); Vu et al. (2015); Ziming et al. (2018)). According to Fig. 2.E.2, spillover patterns are not particularly sensitive to the choice of the fore- casting horizon H, despite the fact that the identiﬁed spillover eﬀects are slightly higher when H is larger. Similar patterns are found in, for example, Diebold and Yil- maz (2009, 2014) and Maghyereh et al. (2015). Generally, more spillover eﬀects are expected to be observed when the forecasting horizon is longer. The reason is that shocks in one market could spill over to others with a short lag or only with a long lag. With a short forecasting horizon, only short-term spillover eﬀects are considered. As 85 Appendix Fig. 2.E.2: Aggregated spillover index for diﬀerent choices of forecasting horizon H = 1, H = 7, H = 14, H = 30. All results are based on log(SD) as volatility measure. the forecasting horizon lengthens, also spillover eﬀects which might only happen in the longer term are included. Therefore, as indicated by Diebold and Yilmaz (2014), there is no reason why the spillover eﬀects should be ‘robust’ to diﬀerent forecasting horizons. Choice of Window Length w Fig. 2.E.3: Aggregated spillover index for diﬀerent choices of window length w = 180, w = 365, and w = 540. All results are based on log(SD) as volatility measure. In addition to w = 365 days, we consider a shorter window length (180 days) and a longer window length (540 days) for the rolling-sample analysis. Results for the aggregated spillover index are plotted in Fig. 2.E.3. As expected, the identiﬁed spillover eﬀects exhibit higher variation for a shorter window length and are more stable for a 86 Appendix longer rolling window choice. Overall, for the window lengths w = 180, 365 and 540 days, the qualitative features of spillover plots are relatively similar. However, it should be noted that due to a diﬀerent window length (backward-looking), diﬀerent time intervals may be classiﬁed as periods with high (or low) spillover eﬀects. Similar results are found in Diebold and Yilmaz (2014). Thus, the applied window length for model estimation has to be considered as an important factor when interpreting the results. 87 Appendix 2.F Comparison to related literature (Apergis et al., 2017) To investigate the factors that lead to the diﬀerence in results between our study and Apergis et al. (2017), we examined the spillover eﬀects by replicating the model choices of Apergis et al. (2017) step by step. Therefore, we applied the same sample period as Apergis et al. (2017), excluded the TAS market, and changed the volatility measure to daily realised variance. The results for the conducted spillover analysis for each of these cases are shown below in Tables 2.F.1–2.F.3.

Interestingly, for none of these settings, the obtained results were very diﬀerent from the results presented in our paper. At the same time, the obtained results were typically still quite diﬀerent from the ones reported in Apergis et al. (2017). In a ﬁnal step, we applied the code and data provided by Apergis et al. (2017) through https://www. sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988317302049. The results for the conducted analysis are reported in Table 2.F.4. Overall, for all conducted tests: (i) alternative sample period, (ii) excluding the market in TAS, (iii) using realized variance as a volatility measure, (iv) using the code and data provided by Apergis et al. (2017), we obtained results that are quite similar to the results reported in our paper. In summary, we ﬁnd diﬀerent results in comparison to Apergis et al. (2017), the empirical study most related to ours. For the studied sample period from 2010-2017, we ﬁnd spillover eﬀects that are lower in comparison to those reported in Apergis et al. (2017). Through the step-by-step replication of Apergis et al. (2017) analysis as shown above, we ﬁnd that the diﬀerent results are not likely to be caused by the diﬀerence in either the model choice or the sample period and markets. As documented by Ullrich (2012), the frequency of data measurement has a signiﬁcant impact on realised volatility measures. The diﬀerences in results could be largely driven by the diﬀerence in the applied volatility measures based on 5-minute and 30-minute price intervals. 89 Appendix Table 2.F.4: Results for spillover analysis based on data and code provided by Apergis et al.

Extreme price outcomes and their transmission between regions pose signiﬁcant risks for market participants. We examine the dependence between extreme price outcomes in the electricity spot market in the Australian National Elec- tricity Market (NEM). We investigate extremal dependence both in a univariate and multivariate setting applying the extremogram developed by Davis and Mikosch (2009) and Davis et al. (2011, 2012). We measure the persistence of extreme prices within individual regional markets and the transmission of extreme prices across diﬀerent re- gions. With both 5-minute and 30-minute price data, we ﬁnd that extreme prices are more persistent in the market with a higher share of intermittent renewable energy. We also ﬁnd that persistence of extreme prices is more prevalent in more concentrated markets. We also show signiﬁcant extremal price dependence between diﬀerent regions, which is typically stronger between physically interconnected markets. The dependence structure of extreme prices shows asymmetric and time-dependent patterns. Applying the extremograms, we further show the eﬀectiveness of the Australian Energy Mar- ket Commission’s 2016 rebidding rule. Our results provide important information for hedging decisions of market participants and for policy makers who aim to reduce mar- ket volatility and extreme price outcomes through eﬀective regulations which guide the trading behaviour of market participants as well as improved network interconnections.

Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets 3.1 Introduction Since the 1990s, the global power sector has been going through a signiﬁcant period of restructuring and deregulation. Similar to other commodities, electricity in many countries is now traded in competitive markets with both spot and derivative contracts (Harris, 2011). Despite recent advances in energy storage such as large scale batteries, electricity is still widely considered as a non-storable good which requires immediate delivery after generation. The non-storable nature of electricity under competitive rules of the market causes an extremely tight relationship between demand and supply. As a result, relatively small ﬂuctuations in generation or transmission can cause signiﬁcant changes in electricity prices within a short time interval, which appear as short-lived but extreme spikes (Pilipovic, 1997; Kaminski, 1999; Bessembinder and Lemmon, 2002; Weron, 2006). This leads electricity spot prices to be substantially more volatile than those of comparable commodities or ﬁnancial instruments. The extreme outcomes in electricity markets are of great concern to market participants and can be detrimental for businesses (e.g. large retailers who purchase electricity with spot prices but sell electricity to customers with a ﬁxed price) without an appropriate hedging strategy. In addition, in a multi-regional context where interconnection is in place, the extreme outcomes often transmit to connected markets through interregional trade of electricity. The possibility of joint price spikes in diﬀerent regions is of particular concern to participants that operate businesses in several regional markets. This paper examines the dependence between extreme price events in the spot electric- ity market in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The NEM operates as a wholesale spot electricity market where supply and demand are matched in real time. It is an interconnected grid across ﬁve regional market jurisdictions: New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA), Tasmania (TAS) and Victo- ria (VIC). Within the NEM, electricity can be transmitted between adjoining regions via high voltage transmission lines, or so-called interconnectors. This typically happens when the electricity price in another region is suﬃciently low to displace the local sup- 93 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets ply, or when the local power demand exceeds the available local generation capacity. The market interconnection allows electricity to be traded from a low price area to a high price area to mitigate the price diﬀerence, limit the market power of local gener- ators in separate regions, improve the reliability of power supply, and reduce overall electricity costs to customers (Productivity Commission, 2013). However, the extent of these beneﬁts is limited by the capacity of interconnectors. As raised by Garnaut (2011) and the Productivity Commission (2013), a potential underinvestment of inter- connectors may have led the NEM to remain relatively isolated (Higgs, 2009; Apergis et al., 2016; Nepal et al., 2016) with substantial price diﬀerence between regions and the market power retained within a small number of generators in each state. Inter- estingly, despite the occasions when substantial price diﬀerences are observed, there have been other periods when extreme prices occurred simultaneously or with a certain time lag in several regional markets (Ignatieva and Trück, 2016). Therefore, there is a strong interest for market participants in the NEM to analyse the complex dependence structure between extreme events of electricity prices. This study aims to provide a better understanding of extreme price outcomes in electric- ity markets as well as the relationship between extreme events both within individual regional electricity spot markets and across diﬀerent regions. We present a pioneering analysis on the application of the extremogram developed by Davis and Mikosch (2009) and Davis et al. (2011, 2012) to address this complex relationship. In addition, as discussed by Clements et al. (2016), a potentially important factor that contributes to large price spikes and raises increasing concerns from both the academic literature and market regulators is the strategic behaviour of generators. In the Australian NEM where half-hourly settlement prices are determined as the average of six 5-minute dispatch intervals, it is possible for generators to implement proﬁt- maximising strategies: for example, generators can create a price spike by withholding capacity in one dispatch interval and adding capacity with low prices afterwards to ensure dispatch, and receive a high average price overall (Dungey et al., 2018). The Australian Energy Market Commission (2015) reported a positive relationship between 94 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets extreme prices and the number of late rebids shifting the oﬀered capacity to higher prices. Hurn et al. (2016) in particular attribute price spikes in QLD to the strategic behaviour of generators. Due to concerns about the negative impacts of this strategic bidding behaviour, new market rules have been implemented to ensure generators bid in good faith and are subject to reviews and amendments, see, for example, Australian Energy Market Commission (2015). Since strategic bidding of market participants is highly relevant to the occurrence of extreme prices and the interregional price diﬀerence (Clements et al., 2016), our study, by examining empirical extremograms before and after a particular market rule change, also aims to shed light on the impacts of market regulation on the behaviour of market participants and eﬃcient market pricing. The extremogram is a ﬂexible measure which quantiﬁes the dependence of extreme events. In a univariate setting, the extremogram can be considered as an extreme- value analog of the widely used autocorrelation function (ACF) for a stationary time series. While the ACF typically has limited value when heavy-tailed nonlinear processes are considered, the extremogram is particularly designed to measure the dependence between tail events (Davis and Mikosch, 2009). In particular, the extremogram com- putes the extent to which an extreme value of a time series has an impact on a future value of the same time series (i.e. univariate extremogram) or another time series (i.e. cross-extremogram). The application of the extremogram ﬁts the time series data of electricity spot prices since these processes exhibit both heavy tails (i.e. extreme values) and volatility clustering (i.e. persistent spikes) over time. Meanwhile, as the extremogram method only considers observations at tails which are extreme and rare by nature, a large sample size is required for accurate estimation of the extremograms. The long time series data available and the high frequency of electricity spot prices are advantageous for the application of extremograms. With the application of ex- tremograms, the persistence and transmission of extreme events can be described both quantitatively and graphically. We apply the extremograms to all ﬁve state-based regional markets in the Australian NEM. Using high frequency spot electricity price data with both half-hourly and 5- 95 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets minute frequencies, we examine the persistence and transmission of extreme electricity prices in the NEM for a sample period of nine years from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2018. Applying a univariate extremogram to each regional market, we ﬁnd highest persis- tence of extreme prices in SA in markets with a higher share of intermittent renewable generation. We also ﬁnd high persistence of extreme prices in QLD, which is a more concentrated market, and in TAS, which is the smallest and most distinct market from the mainland in the NEM. On the other hand, NSW and VIC exhibit substantially lower persistence of extreme prices. In each region, signiﬁcant periodicity is observed in the estimated extremograms, i.e. given an existing price spike, the highest possi- bility for another spike is found around the same time on the next day. Concerning the estimated cross-extremograms, which measure the extremal dependence between diﬀerent markets, we ﬁnd the strongest extremal dependence between adjacent mar- kets that are physically interconnected, for example, NSW and QLD, NSW and VIC, and SA and VIC. This indicates a relatively high possibility of joint price spikes or contagion eﬀects for these pairs of markets. On the other hand, signiﬁcantly lower extremograms are found between markets that are geographically distant and not di- rectly interconnected, such as NSW and TAS, and SA and TAS. Interestingly, despite the existing Basslink interconnector which is a submarine cable between TAS and VIC, the estimated extremal dependence between the regional prices in these two markets is relatively low. These transmission eﬀects vary with diﬀerent forward-looking intervals (i.e. the lags used in the extremogram calculation) and are asymmetric between re- gions. Furthermore, we conduct a case study by applying the extremogram method to investigate the impact of a particular regulatory market event – the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC)’s rebidding rule change (Australian Energy Market Com- mission, 2015) around ‘last minute rebids’ which became eﬀective from 1 July 2016. This change in regulation is aimed to prevent false and misleading bidding behaviour. Overall, our results suggest that the rebidding rule change was eﬀective in reducing strategic bidding behaviour among market participants. 96 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets Our study yields important insights for both market participants and regulators in the Australian NEM in several dimensions. First, our results on extremal dependence across regions provide important information on interregional risk management and hedging strategies. This is of particular interest to traders and merchant interconnec- tors who make a proﬁt by purchasing electricity from a region where the electricity price is relatively cheap and selling it to a region where the local price is high. Second, our results regarding the persistence of extreme prices also have important implications for the operation of large industrial customers with load curtailment arrangements or battery storage, because the timing of buying and selling power (i.e. the ability to buy/use electricity during low price periods and sell/stop using it during high price periods) is highly relevant to their revenues. Third, the analysis of extreme price per- sistence is important for peak load generators such as gas ﬁred plants which require information on future spikes, since peak load generators typically start generating only when there is a high probability of more price spikes in upcoming half-hourly trading intervals. From a regulator’s perspective, our ﬁndings on the extremal dependence structure for diﬀerent regional markets may be helpful for decisions on constructing new interconnectors and developing policies to guide trading strategies of market par- ticipants. Such decisions are important in order to achieve a more integrated market, limit the market power of local generators and reduce the overall price volatility in the NEM. The worldwide deregulation of electricity markets since the 1990s has fostered a rapidly growing literature aiming at modelling and forecasting electricity prices. However, only recently a number of studies focus particularly on extreme events or spikes in electric- ity prices, most of which are conducted in a univariate context. Overall, clustering and persistence are important features of extreme events in electricity markets that are documented in the previous literature. Various models are applied to capture these features. In particular, Christensen et al. (2009) propose a poisson autoregres- sive framework to model electricity price spikes. They argue that persistence is an important feature of spikes to be accounted for. Christensen et al. (2012) use an au- toregressive conditional hazard model to forecast both the occurrence and size of spikes. 97 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets Korniichuk (2012) employs a copula model to capture the dependence in magnitudes of extreme electricity prices and a negative binomial duration model to forecast the occurrence of extreme prices. Clements et al. (2013) propose a semi-parametric ap- proach which is superior in capturing the nonlinearity of the spiking process, while Eichler et al. (2014) use dynamic logit models to forecast the occurrence of electricity price spikes. They show that spikes often occur in clusters and tend to reappear at the same time on the following day. Furthermore, Herrera and González (2014) propose a self-exciting marked point process approach based on either durations or intensities to model spikes. So far the analysis of electricity markets in a multivariate context is still considered as limited despite some recent growth. The focus is typically on measuring the overall interdependence, co-movement and integration level between interconnected markets. De Vany and Walls (1999a), De Vany and Walls (1999b), Park et al. (2006) and Demp- ster et al. (2008) examine the market integration level in US spot electricity markets, using vector autoregressive (VAR) based models and cointegration analysis. De Vany and Walls (1999a,b) ﬁnd evidence of a highly integrated and eﬃcient power market in the western US, while Dempster et al. (2008) suggest only a moderate integration level in the same market. Park et al. (2006) ﬁnd a interrelationship structure between eastern and western US electricity markets that is dependent on the considered length of time horizon. Haldrup and Nielsen (2006) develop a Markov Regime Switching fractional integration model and ﬁnd time-varying patterns in the price dependence between re- gional markets in the Nordpool market in Europe. Zachmann (2008) investigates the integration level of European electricity markets. Applying principal component anal- ysis, the ﬁndings of this study reject the hypothesis of an integrated market. However, pairwise price convergence is observed between several countries when congestion costs are considered. Le Pen and Sévi (2010) estimate the return and volatility spillover eﬀects in three major electricity forward markets in Europe through a VAR-BEKK model. More recently, Ciarreta and Zarraga (2015) use multivariate GARCH models to estimate mean and volatility spillovers of prices among European electricity mar- kets. They ﬁnd evidence that increasing interconnections and homogeneous rules of 98 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets market operations contribute to higher levels of price convergence and market integra- tion. De Menezes and Houllier (2016, 2015) employ fractional cointegration methods to assess the price convergence between diﬀerent European electricity markets, because electricity spot prices in the considered markets are found to be intermediate between a non-stationary and a stationary process. Furthermore, a fundamental multi-market model is developed by Füss et al. (2017). Through the model, the authors illustrate the impacts of interconnectivity between diﬀerent spot markets on the key stylised facts of electricity prices, such as spikes and periods of high volatility. Muniain and Ziel (2020) use bivariate data to forecast electricity prices. A bivariate jump component is included in the model which improves the performance in forecasting correlated time series. In the Australian context, Worthington et al. (2005) and Higgs (2009) employ a family of multivariate GARCH and constant and dynamic conditional correlation (i.e. CCC and DCC) type models to examine volatility spillovers across regional electricity mar- kets. They ﬁnd signiﬁcantly higher conditional correlations between well-connected markets and weaker interdependence between the least interconnected markets. Smith et al. (2012), Aderounmu and Wolﬀ (2014a,b), Smith (2015), Ignatieva and Trück (2016) and Smith and Shively (2018) apply various copula models to examine the nonlinear dependence structure and tail dependence between regional electricity spot prices in Australia. Furthermore, two studies investigate the degree of market inte- gration in Australian electricity markets. In particular, Nepal et al. (2016) conduct pairwise unit root tests, a cointegration analysis, and a time-varying coeﬃcient model based on the Kalman ﬁlter to examine the integration level of interconnected regional markets in the Australian NEM. Their results suggest that full integration has not been achieved due to the limitation of interconnector capacities. Apergis et al. (2016) test for price convergence across diﬀerent electricity markets in Australia by employing a clustering groups approach. Considering the ﬁve regional markets in the NEM as well as the Western Australia (WA) market, they ﬁnd long-term price convergence in three groups: NSW, QLD and VIC; SA; and TAS and WA. The separation of these groups is inﬂuenced by factors such as physical interconnections, market structures and 99 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets competition levels. Among the multivariate electricity market literature, only a few recent studies focus on extreme price events. In particular, Clements et al. (2015) assess the transmission of price spikes across interconnected regional markets in the Australian NEM by devel- oping a multivariate self-exciting point process model. They ﬁnd that the size of price spikes is impacted by the available interconnector capacity: the size of spikes tends to be smaller where there is greater excess capacity into a region. Bigerna et al. (2017) apply a contagion model on diﬀerent electricity markets in Italy. They separate be- tween contagion arising only in exceptional market conditions and the interdependence between markets. Dynamic copula models are developed in Manner et al. (2016, 2019) to forecast the occurrence of spikes in multiple regional markets. Do et al. (2020) con- duct a higher moment interconnectedness analysis in the Australian NEM and suggest that the transmission of extreme price risk can be reduced by increasing transmission and generation capacity in the NEM. Despite the limited focus on electricity price spikes in the multivariate context, existing studies typically put more eﬀort on modelling or forecasting the occurrence and size of spikes, and there is a lack of documented evidence on describing the characteristics and dynamics of these extreme price outcomes, for example, how persistent they are and the directions and timing of their transmissions, both in individual and intercon- nected markets. In addition, none of these studies has applied the newly developed extremogram (Davis and Mikosch, 2009; Davis et al., 2011, 2012) to examine these extremal dependences or use this technique to examine the impacts of market events. A number of studies have recently developed methods to analyse dependence in quan- tiles of distributions of time series data, including, for example, quantilograms (Linton and Whang, 2007) and cross-quantilograms (Han et al., 2016; Todorova, 2017), quantile correlations (Schmitt et al., 2015), quantile autocorrelation functions (Li et al., 2015), and multivariate multi-quantile models (White et al., 2015). In comparison to these methods, the extremogram focuses on extreme quantiles. The extremogram method was ﬁrst introduced by Davis and Mikosch (2009) and Davis et al. (2011, 2012) to 100 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets measure serial dependence of extreme values in strictly stationary time series. Various aspects of extremograms were later discussed, including the asymptotic theory (Davis et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2016; Matsui and Mikosch, 2016) and bootstrapping methods to construct conﬁdence bands for extremograms (Davis et al., 2012; Drees, 2015). It has been recently applied to measure serial dependence of extreme observations and co-movements in stock markets (Bollerslev et al., 2013; Herrera and Clements, 2018; Hautsch and Herrera, 2020), credit default swap (CDS) markets (Cont and Kan, 2011) and extreme rainfall pattern identiﬁcation (Rinaldi et al., 2018). Furthermore, apart from using extremograms to measure the extremal dependence, Mikosch and Zhao (2015) implement a goodness of ﬁt test in frequency domain to conduct model selec- tion based on the ability of extremograms to explain the dependence in tails. Overall, we complement and extend the work of Higgs and Worthington (2005), Wor- thington et al. (2005), Higgs (2009) and Ignatieva and Trück (2016) on the Australian NEM by particularly focusing on the extremal dependence in spot electricity prices. Our ﬁndings contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we apply the extremogram method and conﬁrm its eﬀectiveness in capturing the transmission of extreme electric- ity prices. Second, compared with the existing literature, we provide a more in-depth analysis of extremal dependence in the Australian NEM by estimating more detailed patterns of these eﬀects. Evidence such as the magnitudes, directions and persistence of extremal dependence is documented. Third, our results provide empirical evidence on the eﬀectiveness of the AEMC’s 2016 rebidding rule change, which has not been studied yet in the existing literature. The remaining part of this study is organised as follows. Section 3.2 brieﬂy reviews the institutional structure of the Australian NEM. Section 3.3 introduces the applied extremogram method, while Section 3.4 presents our empirical results. Finally, Sec- tion 3.5 discusses the main ﬁndings of this study and concludes. 101 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets 3.2 The Australian National Electricity Market Electricity markets in Australia have undergone substantial changes since the 1990s (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018). Prior to 1997, the power system in Australia consisted of several vertically integrated and government owned businesses in each state. There was no interconnection between the individual states. Electricity prices in the market were determined by the regulations of each state government to cover costs with potential required returns determined by the government. With the objective of promoting power market eﬃciency, the Australian government commenced reform of the electricity markets in the late 1990s. In particular, the supply industry was separated into diﬀerent segments, including transmission and distribution networks which remained in a regulated monopoly, and generation and retail markets which are now operated as competitive markets. In addition, interconnection between adjoining states was introduced to form a national wholesale market for electricity trading. The NEM started as a wholesale electricity market in Australia in December 1998. It is now an interconnected grid including ﬁve state-based regional markets in NSW, QLD, SA, TAS and VIC. Electricity trade in the NEM is established through a central pool where the outputs from all generators are aggregated and matched with the forecast demand. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) manages this pool, fol- lowing the National Electricity Law and relevant rules made by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC). Unlike many electricity markets in the US and Europe, the NEM is not operated as a day-ahead market but is a spot market where electricity is traded in real time. Note that two key terms regarding time intervals are important in the NEM context: the dispatch interval (5 minutes) and trading interval (a half hour). Generators in the NEM are required to submit oﬀers and specify their available capacity and acceptable prices to cover their costs for the next half-hourly trading in- terval. Every ﬁve minutes, AEMO operates a central dispatch process. It determines a price (i.e. dispatch price) for each region and the generators to be dispatched for the next ﬁve minutes based on the currently available oﬀers and forecast demand through 102 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets a least cost optimisation algorithm. In particular, generators with lower oﬀered prices get higher priority to be dispatched. They are dispatched in ascending order of oﬀers until the market demand is met, and the dispatch price is determined by the highest oﬀered price of all generators that get dispatched. The ﬁnal price (i.e. trading price) is set every half-hour for each region by averaging six 5-minute dispatch prices in a half-hourly trading interval (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018). Generated electric- ity is settled each half-hour and generators in the same region are paid uniformly for their dispatched output at the regional spot price, which equals the half-hourly trading price in a region. One critical feature of the NEM bidding mechanism is that genera- tors are allowed to make variations to their existing bids at any time until ﬁve minutes before the dispatch interval. This feature aims to help achieve a high adaptability on the supply side to eﬀectively respond to real-time grid or market changes. However, as argued by Clements et al. (2016) and Dungey et al. (2018), this ﬂexible rebidding mechanism also provides generators with the opportunity to submit strategic bids and rebids which can lead to undesirable consequences and detach the spot price from the fundamental costs of generation. As pointed out by Higgs and Worthington (2008) and Mayer and Trück (2018), the Australian NEM is signiﬁcantly more volatile and spike prone compared to other elec- tricity markets in the world. The NEM also has an extremely high price cap (the maximum possible spot price) which is higher than price caps in other electricity mar- kets around the world. While the NEM spot price under normal conditions is typically below A$100/MWh, the NEM price cap at the beginning of the sample period was A$10,000/MWh on July 1, 2009, and increased to A$14,200/MWh at the end of the sample period on June 30, 2018. During our sample period, there have been several oc- casions in each region when the spot price was close to or hit the speciﬁed market cap. Therefore, hedging the risk induced by extreme price events is of particular importance for market participants in the NEM, since the surge of costs can be detrimental for businesses such as retailers who purchase electricity at the spot price and sell it at a ﬁxed price to their customers. 103 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets Recent years have seen a rapid development of the market for electricity derivatives, including forward, futures and option contracts. For example, the Australian Secu- rities Exchange (ASX) provides various futures and options products for traders and market participants in the NEM to earn proﬁts through trading or to hedge their risk according to particular needs16. Note that derivative contracts for electricity markets typically do not require physical delivery but are subject to ﬁnancial settlement. As a result, participation in electricity derivatives markets does not require owning physical generation assets. As well as monthly, quarterly and annual futures contracts that are priced based on the average spot prices of electricity during a certain delivery period, the ASX oﬀers a number of alternative derivative contracts tailored towards extreme price outcomes. The most widely used product for extreme price hedging is the ‘Base Load Calendar Quarter $300 Cap Futures’ for each region (ASX Limited, 2019). Note that for this product, ‘Base Load’ hours are deﬁned as the period from 00:00am to 24:00am on each calendar day. The payoﬀ of these contracts depends on both the magnitude and the frequency of the extreme prices for a particular region in the cal- endar quarter that exceed A$300/MWh. More speciﬁcally, the cash settlement price is calculated as C−300×D E , where C is the sum of all spot prices for a certain region in the calendar quarter that exceed A$300, D is the total count of the occasions when the spot price is greater than A$300/MWh, and E is the total count of half-hourly intervals. Estimating the payoﬀ of such a contract is important for relevant market participants in the NEM to evaluate their hedging strategies. Since the calculation of payoﬀs requires the forecast of future spike count in a certain period, the persistence or potential recurrence possibility of a price spike would be highly relevant. Therefore, our extremogram analysis is of particular interest in terms of modelling the payoﬀ distri- bution of these types of contracts in future work. For example, the estimated empirical extremogram during peak/oﬀ-peak time periods could be applied as a condition when prices are simulated or modelled for diﬀerent scenarios. The ﬁve regional markets in the NEM are currently linked through six interconnectors. 16 For available energy derivative contracts traded in the ASX, see the ASX website: https://www.asxenergy.com.au/. 104 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets In particular, two interconnectors (QNI and Terranora) are between NSW and QLD; two interconnectors (Heywood and Murraylink) are between VIC and SA; one Victoria- NSW Interconnector is between NSW and VIC; and Basslink is an undersea power cable between TAS and VIC (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018). Basslink is a merchant interconnector that derives proﬁt by actively participating in the interregional trade of electricity, while the other ﬁve interconnectors are regulated interconnectors and receive ﬁxed revenue based on the asset value regardless of their actual usage. These interconnectors play a signiﬁcant role in limiting the market power of local generators and facilitating market integration of the NEM (Productivity Commission, 2013), by allowing electricity to be imported from a low priced region with surplus generation ca- pacity to a high priced region. However, the beneﬁts of interregional trades are limited by the physical capacity of interconnectors. Without suﬃcient available capacity, the interconnectors during peak-load occasions may become congested, limiting generation capacity within the local market and leading to unnecessarily high prices in the high de- mand region while the prices in other regions remain at normal levels. By investigating interconnector usage, Nepal et al. (2016) ﬁnd a signiﬁcant transmission bottleneck for all interconnectors in the NEM and therefore propose that more investment is needed both to increase the capacity of existing interconnectors and to build new interconnec- tion facilities. The issue of potential under-investment in the market interconnection has also been pointed out by Higgs (2009), Garnaut (2011) and Apergis et al. (2016). As a result, while signiﬁcant co-movement of spot prices in diﬀerent regions exists in the NEM, periods of substantial price diﬀerence are also observed. Meanwhile, inter- regional trade in the NEM still represents a relatively small fraction of the supply for each regional market which is on average below 20% (Australian Energy Regulator, 2020). Among the ﬁve regional markets, QLD and VIC are the main electricity exporters with high capacity of relatively cheap coal generation. NSW, as the largest regional market with the highest average demand in the NEM, typically imports electricity from QLD and VIC to supply around 10% of its regional demand. With a large share of electricity generation from intermittent resources (i.e. wind), SA has signiﬁcantly more volatile 105 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets market supply and prices compared to other regions. As a result, it often imports electricity from VIC for 10% to 20% of its local demand, but can also export electricity when suﬃcient wind power is in place (Australian Energy Regulator, 2020). Similarly, TAS, with close to 90% hydro power in its total registered capacity, has a trade position ﬂuctuating corresponding to relevant market policies 17 and weather conditions. 3.3 The extremogram Extreme events, by deﬁnition, refer to observations in the (left or right) tail of a distribution that occur infrequently by nature. In their own right, the study of extreme events is of importance. More interestingly, in time series data, temporal dependence between extreme events can usually be observed within a single process or between two or more series. The extremogram (Davis and Mikosch, 2009; Davis et al., 2011, 2012) is a ﬂexible tool for quantifying various forms of extremal dependence in stationary time series. The extremogram computes the impact that a large value of the time series, or extreme value, has on a future value of the same time series or another time series, with h time lags ahead. Since electricity spot prices are well known for their heavy tails (i.e. spikes) and clustering of high volatility and extreme events (Weron, 2006; Higgs, 2009), the application of the extremogram can provide important insights in the context of electricity markets. 3.3.1 The univariate extremogram Davis and Mikosch (2009) and Davis et al. (2011, 2012) deﬁne the univariate ex- tremogram for a stationary time series (Xt) and two sets A and B which are bounded 17 For example, when the Carbon Pricing Mechanism which favours renewable generation was in place between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2014, TAS became the major electricity exporter and even recorded the highest export ratio of all regions since the NEM started. 106 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets away from zero 18 as ρA,B(h) = lim x→∞ P (x−1Xh ∈ B|x−1X0 ∈ A), (3.1) for h lags in time. Given that A and B are bounded away from zero, the events {x−1X0 ∈ A} and {x−1X0 ∈ B} are extreme as the probabilities converge to zero when x → ∞. Empirically, the limit on x in Eq. (3.1) can be replaced by a high quantile of the time series. Assuming am is the (1 − 1 m )-quantile of the stationary distribution of a time series ∥Xt∥, the empirical univariate extremogram with h time lags (i.e. h periods ahead), based on the observations X1, ..., Xn is given by ˆρA,B(h) = ∑n−h t=1 I{a−1 m Xt+h ∈ B, a−1 m Xt ∈ A} ∑n t=1 I{a−1 m Xt ∈ A} . (3.2) In practice, am is often replaced by an empirical quantile of the sample ∥Xt∥. For example, if we are interested in the large positive extreme events (or the right tail), we could use the upper empirical quantiles of the time series for am (e.g., the 90 th, 95 th and 99th quantiles). Large negative extreme events (or the left tail) can also be examined by the lower empirical quantiles of the time series for am (e.g., the 10 th, 5 th and 1 st quantiles). Not only can the extremogram provide evidence of extremal dependence in and between time series, it can also be used to help with the statistical modelling of the time series. For example, the estimation of the sample extremogram for a given time series speciﬁes the extent and patterns of volatility clustering of the time series. Connecting this phenomenon to the properties of prominent time series models such as the GARCH and Stochastic Volatility models will be informative for model selection. In time series analysis, models are usually selected based on their ﬁt to the centre of the distribution. However, they may ﬁt poorly to the (right and left) tails of the distribution. Therefore, 18 A set S is bounded away from zero if a positive r exists such that S ⊂ {y : |y| > r}(Davis and Mikosch, 2009; Davis et al., 2011, 2012). 107 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets with the aim of modelling the extremes of the distribution of time series data, a separate examination of extremograms of the time series would be beneﬁcial. Furthermore, the quality of the model ﬁt could also be assessed by estimating the sample extremogram of the residuals, and the applied model can be improved and updated based on these results. 3.3.2 The cross-extremogram The formula for the extremogram described in Eq. (3.2) provides a description of the extremal dependence within a time series. However, in order to observe the extremal dependence between two or more time series, we consider the cross-extremogram. For the bivariate time series (Xt, Yt)t∈Z, the cross-extremogram with h lags is deﬁned as ˆρA,B(h) = ∑n−h t=1 I{a−1 m,Y Yt+h ∈ B, a−1 m,XXt ∈ A} ∑n t=1 I{a−1 m,XXt ∈ A} . (3.3) where A, B are sets bounded away from zero; am,X and am,Y are replaced by the respective empirical quantiles computed from the time series (Xt)t=1,...,n and (Yt)t=1,...,n. The sample cross-extremogram will depend on two empirical quantiles (am,X and am,Y ) which are not required to be equal and are subject to the research question to be analysed. 3.3.3 Permutation procedure In order to test for the signiﬁcance of the serial extremal dependence at each lag of the extremogram, we create conﬁdence bounds for the estimated extremogram through a random permutation procedure. By permuting the data in the time series, the serial dependence inherent in the data is completely destroyed. Hence, under the null hypoth- esis of no serial extremal dependence, we can control the type I error for signiﬁcance of the extremogram. The conﬁdence bounds created by the permutation procedure can be considered as the analogue of the conﬁdence bounds calculated as ± z1− α 2√n (where alpha 108 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets is the determined signiﬁcance interval, n is the number of observations, and z is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution) which is widely used in the sample autocorrelation function (ACF) of a time series. Spikes that ex- tend beyond the bounds infer that the ACF at the corresponding lags are signiﬁcantly non-zero and there is serial autocorrelation in the data (Little, 2013). In particular, the permutation procedure for the sample univariate extremogram con- sists of generating a pseudo time series (X ∗ t )t∈Z by permuting the original time series (Xt)t∈Z. The sample extremogram is then estimated on the pseudo time series using Eq. (3.2). For the cross-extremogram, bivariate pseudo time series (X ∗ t , Y ∗ t )t∈Z are generated and the cross-extremogram is then estimated on the bivariate pseudo time series using Eq. (3.3). The result at each lag is recorded and this procedure is re- peated a large number of times (in this study, the procedure is repeated 1,000 times). At each lag of the extremogram, we combine the results across all permutations to create a permutation distribution for the sample extremogram ˆρA,B(h). We then cal- culate the (1-α/2) and α/2 empirical quantiles of the permutation distribution at each lag and interpret them as 100(1-α)% conﬁdence bounds. For each lag h, if the esti- mated sample extremogram ˆρA,B(h) exceeds (either larger or smaller) the 100(1-α)% conﬁdence bounds obtained from the permutation procedure, we conclude that there is signiﬁcant evidence of extremal dependence. On the other hand, if the estimated extremogram ˆρA,B(h) is within the 100(1-α)% conﬁdence interval, we conclude that there is no signiﬁcant extremal dependence at that lag. Since the numerator of the extremogram calculation in Eqs. (3.2) and (3.3) is a sum over n − h terms, the es- timated extremogram is dependent on the selection of h, however the dependence is only mild due to the random permutation procedure and the infrequent nature of ex- treme events. Apart from this boundary eﬀect, the permutation distribution of the sample extremogram is almost the same across all lags h. Therefore, in the following graphical assessment of extremograms in Section 3.4, we examine the signiﬁcance of the estimated extremogram against the (1-α/2) and α/2 empirical quantiles of the permutation distribution at lag 1, for interpretational and visual simplicity. 109 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets 3.4 Empirical analysis 3.4.1 The data Table 3.1 provides descriptive statistics for high frequency spot prices in the ﬁve re- gional markets in the NEM: NSW, QLD, SA, TAS and VIC. In our empirical analysis, both half-hourly trading prices (Panel (a)) and 5-minute dispatch prices (Panel (b)) are used with a sample period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2018. We ﬁnd that for both half-hourly and 5-minute data, mean price levels are the low- est in VIC, where average prices are below A$50/MWh, while slightly higher mean price levels could be observed for NSW (A$52.02/MWh) and TAS (A$53.78/MWh). Prices throughout the sample period are the highest in SA with a mean price level of A$61.92/MWh. Note that prices in SA also have the highest standard deviation, indicating the highest volatility of the SA market, while the regional market in TAS has the lowest price standard deviation during the sample period. The data also show typical features for electricity spot prices, like extreme maximum and negative mini- mum values 19, high standard deviation, skewness and excess kurtosis, with prices being right-skewed such that the median is always signiﬁcantly lower than the mean. Table 3.1 also reports the number and percentage of extreme observations where prices are above A$150, A$300 and A$5000 per MWh. It is noteworthy that QLD and SA appear to be more spiky than other markets, since many more observations of extreme prices are found in these two markets, when the threshold is set as A$300 or A$5000 per MWh. In comparison, more smaller price spikes are observed in TAS when the threshold is set as A$150. Furthermore, the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) statistics suggest that all series are stationary at the 1% signiﬁcance level. 19 Negative price can be commonly observed in electricity markets (Fanone et al., 2013). Because of the non-storable nature of electricity, it typically happens when electricity demand is low and generators in the market are unable to adjust their output accordingly due to high costs and inﬂexibility of power plants to shut down and restart. 110 Chapter 3.

Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets Fig. 3.1 plots the spot prices over the entire sample for two regions: NSW (upper panel) and QLD (lower panel). Signiﬁcant price spikes are observed in the ﬁgure. Within each regional market, clusters of spikes are evident. When considering both regions, there are several occasions when spikes jointly appear in NSW and QLD. Note that time series plots for other regions are presented Fig. 3.A.1 in the Appendix. Fig. 3.1: Half-hourly spot prices (A$/MWh) for the NSW (upper panel)and QLD (lower panel) electricity markets from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2018. Note that typically the literature on modelling and analysing electricity spot prices suggests representing the spot or system price Pt by a sum of two independent parts: a predictable seasonal component ft and a stochastic component Xt, i.e., Pt = ft + Xt, see, e.g., Weron (2006) and Bierbrauer et al. (2007). Therefore, in many empirical applications the ﬁrst step is to estimate the seasonal component that is assumed to be deterministic, while in a second step the behaviour of the stochastic price component is modelled. While Australian electricity prices also exhibit some degree of seasonality (Higgs, 2009; Ignatieva and Trück, 2016), our analysis is mainly concerned with extreme 112 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets price spikes above a relatively high threshold. For these normally short-lived and generally unanticipated extreme changes in the spot price, the seasonal pattern only plays a minor role. Thus, we believe that for our analysis of autocorrelation in extreme events as well as the persistence and joint occurrence of extreme price observations with the extremogram, it is appropriate to use actual spot prices instead of a deseasonalised version of these prices. Note that our analysis focuses on extreme outcomes only in the upper tail region. While prices in the NEM very rarely also exhibit negative price spikes, the major interest of market participants is typically extreme positive price observations. The magnitude of negative price spikes is much smaller than that of positive ones, because the price ﬂoor of the NEM is (-A$1000)/MWh, whereas the cap is up to A$14,200/MWh during our sample period (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018). With the occurrence of extremely high prices, proﬁts of market participants in the NEM can be wiped out or signiﬁcantly reduced within a short period of time. Both the size and the duration of these extreme price spikes are of substantial concern, particularly to retailers who buy electricity for a ﬂexible price but sell it for a ﬁxed price (Eichler et al., 2014; Clements et al., 2015; Australian Energy Regulator, 2018). 3.4.2 Univariate analysis 3.4.2.1 Analysis of half-hourly prices We begin our examination with a univariate analysis on half-hourly prices, i.e. we compute the extremograms within each individual market in the NEM separately. 20 Such an analysis will provide us with a better understanding of the persistence of extreme price outcomes. As pointed out by Davis and Mikosch (2009) and Davis et al. (2011, 2012), one of the 20 Both the univariate and cross-extremograms were estimated using the extremogram R package (Frol- ova and Cribben, 2015). 113 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets key issues in computing the extremogram is the selection of a suitable threshold to deﬁne ‘extreme events’. As mentioned earlier, ASX Energy oﬀers ‘$300 Cap Products’, i.e. a derivatives contract speciﬁcally designed for the occurrence of extreme price observations. The payoﬀ of these products is determined by the sum of all half-hourly spot prices greater than A$300/MWh for a calendar quarter in a regional market and is highly relevant to our research objective in terms of assessing the pattern of extreme price events. Based on the deﬁnition of these products that are widely traded in the market, we believe that A$300/MWh is a natural choice for an appropriate threshold, above which the prices are considered as ‘extreme’. Note that this threshold corresponds to the 99.86 th percentile for NSW, the 99.55 th percentile for QLD, the 99.34 th percentile for SA, the 99.73 th percentile for TAS and the 99.88 th percentile for VIC such that less than 1% of half-hourly spot electricity prices are above A$300/MWh. Fig. 3.2 provides a plot of the sample extremograms applied to half-hourly price ob- servations for the markets in NSW, QLD and SA for the considered sample period. In each graph, the solid horizontal line is the generated 99% conﬁdence bound, based on the permutation produced described above. The sample extremograms outside these bounds indicate the existence of signiﬁcant serial extremal dependence at the corre- sponding lags. For the NSW market, the extremogram has a large value (about 0.75) at the ﬁrst lag, indicating that given a price spike in NSW a half hour ago, there is an approximately 75% probability of another extreme price in this market in the current half hour. The extremal dependence as measured by the extremogram diminishes rapidly, and becomes insigniﬁcant after 12 lags. However, a cluster of signiﬁcant extremograms reappear around the 48 th lag. Weak but signiﬁcant extremal dependence is also found around the 96 th and 144 th lags. The sample data are recorded on a half-hourly basis, and each day has 48 half-hourly intervals. Therefore, the univariate extremogram plots for NSW illustrate the existence of extremal dependence between prices one day apart, indicating that given a price spike on a certain day, more spikes tend to occur in this market around the same time on the following days. The extremogram plots for QLD 114 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets are diﬀerent in shape compared to those for NSW. Signiﬁcant extremal dependence is observed at all lags but becomes weaker gradually. The slow decay of extremograms over long lags indicates strong persistence of extreme prices in the QLD market. Apart from the diﬀerence in persistence, compared to the NSW price extremograms, QLD price extremograms exhibit similar periodicity such that the value of extremograms peaks every 48 lags, indicating that a given spike has a higher possibility of reappearing at the same time in the following days. The extremogram plots for prices in SA show a pattern similar to the QLD market. In particular, the extremograms are persistent, and the persistence of price spikes is even stronger than in QLD. Furthermore, we observe relatively high values for the extremogram around the 1 st, 48 th, 96 th, 144th and 192 th lags. Fig. 3.3 plots the sample extremograms applied to half-hourly price observations for the electricity markets in TAS and VIC. The TAS market shows evidence of relatively strong persistence of extreme prices, since extremograms over the ﬁrst 200 lags are all signiﬁcant with a slow speed of decay. In particular, the extreme price persistence after the 100th lag in TAS is the strongest among all regional markets in the NEM. The possibility of extreme prices reappearing around the same time in the following days in TAS is also stronger than for other markets. On the other hand, for the VIC market, signiﬁcant extremograms are only observed over the ﬁrst 14 lags and around the 48 th lag. The extremal dependence of prices in VIC decays to zero within 54 lags, which is the fastest among the ﬁve considered markets. 115 Chapter 3.

Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets 3.4.2.2 Analysis of 5-minute prices In this section, 5-minute dispatch data are considered so that more details of ex- tremograms in the high-frequency domain can be examined. In addition, the analysis in a 5-minute context is of importance since the NEM is in transition from 30-minute settlement to 5-minute settlement. The NEM will start a 5-minute settlement in 2021 and is argued to be able to provide better price signals for fast response technologies and demand responses 21. With higher frequency of the data, we are able to focus on more severe price spikes because of more available observations of these extreme outcomes. Therefore, an A$5000/MWh threshold is chosen for 5-minute extremal de- pendence examination. Also, A$5000/MWh is a critical threshold since the market regulator is required to prepare a report to investigate the underlying reason causing the high price value whenever this threshold is reached 22. The estimated 5-minute extremograms are presented in Fig. 3.4 and Fig. 3.5. The extremograms for all considered markets exhibit signiﬁcant values following the ﬁrst lag and around the 288 th lag. Since each single day contains 288 5-minute intervals, similar to the half-hourly analysis, this means a given spike is more likely to reappear within a series of subsequent intervals and at the same time of the next day. Interestingly, when the A$5000/MWh threshold is considered, none of the considered markets present strong local persistence of extreme prices, indicating the rarity of events when spot prices exceed A$5000/MWh. In between the ﬁrst lag and around the 288 th lag, the estimated extremograms decrease to be insigniﬁcant typically within 50 lags (i.e. 4 hours). The estimated extremograms are lowest in TAS and decay to zero the fastest, which is consistent with the smallest number of over A$5000/MWh price observations for TAS in Table 3.1. 21 See https://www.aemc.gov.au/rule-changes/ﬁve-minute-settlement for details about 5-minute settle- ment. 22 For examples of the ‘$5000 Report’, see https://www.aer.gov.au/taxonomy/term/310. 118 Chapter 3.

Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets Overall, with regard to univariate extremograms, each of the regional markets in the NEM exhibits persistence of extreme prices to a certain extent. In addition, for all con- sidered markets, serial extremal dependence tends to be relatively high between prices a day apart, indicating a high possibility of an existing price spike reappearing around the same time after one day. These features within individual electricity markets are consistent with the ﬁndings of Clements et al. (2013) and Eichler et al. (2014). In particular, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant persistence in extreme price outcomes in QLD, SA and TAS. The highest persistence of extreme prices is observed in SA. This is according to our expectations, since SA has the most volatile and spiky spot prices due to its large share of intermittent wind generation. The signiﬁcant uncertainty in the SA market supply of electricity induces large ﬂuctuations of spot prices. In addition, the risk of in- terconnectors between SA and VIC being constrained, when SA local demand soars and insuﬃcient wind power is available, contributes to more signiﬁcant and persistent price spikes. The high persistence of extreme prices in QLD could be attributed to the high concentration level in this market (i.e. high market power controlled by several market participants) (Hurn et al., 2016; Australian Energy Regulator, 2018) which leads to more occurrence of price spikes. Similarly, for TAS which is the smallest market in the NEM and distant from mainland regions with only one submarine cable connecting to VIC, the market power is highly concentrated with one government owned participant, i.e. Hydro Tasmania, owning all generation capacity (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018). High market concentration as well as the occasional inability to import electric- ity from VIC when the interconnector is congested could be contributing factors to the relatively high persistence and periodicity of half-hourly prices above the A$300/MWh threshold in TAS. Interestingly, however, because of the ﬂexibility of the local hydro power system to rapidly respond to extraordinary market events, very few ‘huge’ spikes (i.e. prices exceeds A$5000/MWh) are observed in TAS. This leads to a much weaker persistence in the estimated extremograms for the 5-minute analysis for TAS compared to other markets. We also ﬁnd that well-connected markets such as NSW and VIC show signiﬁcantly lower 121 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets persistence of extreme price outcomes. These ﬁndings indicate signiﬁcant importance of interconnectors in terms of reducing the occurrence of extreme price outcomes and high volatility periods. Furthermore, the 5-minute analysis shows that the persistence existing in prices above A$5000/MWh is relatively low with prices returning to less extreme levels below the threshold more quickly for all markets. However, similar to the periodicity found in the half-hourly analysis with a A$300/MWh threshold, a current price spike exceeding A$5000/MWh also has a chance of reappearing the next day, what is evidenced by low but signiﬁcant extremograms around the 288 th lag. 3.4.3 Multivariate analysis 3.4.3.1 Analysis of half-hourly prices In this section, we analyse cross-extremal dependence to assess the transmission ef- fects of extreme prices between the regional markets. To do this we compute cross- extremograms in a bivariate setting for diﬀerent combinations of the regional markets. Fig. 3.6 shows the sample cross-extremograms of half-hourly spot prices conditioning on price spikes in the NSW electricity market. In each panel, the cross-extremogram at lag 0 can be interpreted as the probability of observing a price spike in the corresponding market given an extreme price observed in NSW at the same time. In comparison, the cross-extremogram at lag 1 can be interpreted as the probability of observing a price spike in the corresponding market at time t (the current half-hourly interval) given an extreme price observed in NSW at t − 1 (the previous half-hourly interval). Signiﬁcant extremal dependence as measured by cross-extremograms is found between NSW and QLD, NSW and SA, and NSW and VIC. In particular, the most signiﬁcant cross-extremograms are observed between NSW and QLD at lags 0 to 8, and around the 48 th and 96 th lags which correspond to the same time on the two consecutive days following the initial price spike. The cross-extremograms observed in SA conditioning on spikes in NSW drop oﬀ to zero over the ﬁrst 8 lags, while the cross-extremograms 122 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets observed in VIC only last for three lags. With regard to cross-extremograms conditioning on price spikes in QLD (Fig. 3.7), extremal dependence is only observed between QLD and NSW. The signiﬁcant extremal dependence at lag 0 indicates the probability of joint price spikes in these two markets. Signiﬁcant extremal dependence is also found around the 48 th and 96 th lags. In Fig. 3.8, signiﬁcant cross-extremograms are found between SA and all other mar- kets. Signiﬁcant extremal dependence tends to appear in clusters: over short lags following lag 0 and around the 48 th and 96 th lags. The highest level of extremal depen- dence is observed between SA and VIC, indicating both contemporaneous and lagged transmission eﬀects of price spikes from SA to VIC. Interestingly, for NSW and QLD, cross-extremograms conditioning on price spikes in SA are larger around the 48 th and 96 th lags than at the ﬁrst several lags. This indicates that extreme prices in SA tend to spill over to NSW and QLD one day and two days later, rather than simultaneously occur in these markets. One reason for this could be the market expectations in NSW and QLD about high demand and price spikes in SA re-occurring around the same hours on the following days, which can lead to changed bidding behaviours in these markets for those hours. Recall that SA is not directly connected to either NSW or QLD, but only indirectly through interconnectors via VIC. In Fig. 3.9, signiﬁcant cross-extremograms conditioning on price spikes in TAS are observed for SA and VIC. In both cases the extremal dependence decays to be in- signiﬁcant within around ﬁve lags. This indicates the relatively low price inﬂuence and demand pressure from TAS on other markets. Fig. 3.10 illustrates that the VIC market has signiﬁcant extremal dependence with all other considered markets; and the dependence between VIC and SA is the strongest. Note that in this ﬁgure, the cross-extremogram for SA at lag 0, which is higher than 0.8, is signiﬁcantly larger than the cross-extremogram for any other bi-variate relation- ship displayed in Figs. 3.6–3.10. It indicates a large probability of joint extreme prices occurring contemporaneously in SA and VIC. This strong extremal dependence dimin- 123 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets ishes rapidly, while weaker dependence reappears around the 48 th lag. On the other hand, cross-extremograms from VIC to NSW and QLD are more signiﬁcant around the 48 th lag than at the ﬁrst several lags. In other words, given that there is a price spike in VIC at time t, e.g., today at a speciﬁc hour, the probability of observing a spike in NSW and QLD on the following day at t + 48 is higher than the probability of a contemporaneous spikes. For the impact of extreme price events in VIC on NSW and SA, our ﬁndings may be explained the following way: since SA is only connected to VIC, it is more likely to be impacted directly by high prices in VIC. NSW, however, is also connected to QLD such that shocks to the VIC market might not transmit imme- diately to NSW. However, market expectations for the same hour on the following day then seem to signiﬁcantly increase the likelihood of also observing a price spike in the NSW and QLD markets. Interestingly, despite the one interconnector between VIC and TAS, the extremal dependence between these two markets appears to be weak and decays to be insigniﬁcant within ﬁve lags. 124 Chapter 3.

Note that the y-axis limits in this ﬁgure are diﬀerent from those in Figs. 3.6–3.9 due to high extremograms from VIC to SA. 129 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets 3.4.3.2 Analysis of 5-minute prices When 5-minute prices and an A$5000/MWh threshold are considered (Figs. 3.11–3.15), the estimated extremograms show similar results to those observed for half-hourly data. However, the magnitude of the estimated extremograms is typically lower, be- cause there are less events where spot prices exceed the A$5000/MWh threshold. We ﬁnd that there is signiﬁcant extremal dependence between NSW and QLD and SA. Price spikes in NSW are likely to transmit to QLD both in subsequent periods and at the same time of the following day (t + 288), while the extremograms from NSW to SA decay to be insigniﬁcant within 30 lags (2.5 hours). QLD only has signiﬁcant cross-extremograms with NSW, reﬂecting the direct interconnection between these two markets. Cross-extremograms from SA to NSW and QLD are signiﬁcant around the same time of the following day (t + 288), based on a price spike in SA at period t. While there are no interconnectors between SA and either NSW or QLD, the detected extremal dependence reﬂects that SA is the most spiky and volatile market and tends to transmit some uncertainties to the entire NEM. TAS exhibits no signiﬁcant impact of extreme price shocks on other markets. This is partially due to the less extreme price observations in TAS, and also indicates a relatively low inﬂuence of TAS on the remaining NEM regions. Regarding VIC, cross-extremograms from VIC to SA are still the highest compared to those of other markets. Compared to the level of extremal dependence for the half-hourly analysis, 5-minute extremograms from VIC to all other markets are weaker, because VIC has the lowest mean spot price and the frequency of price spikes higher than A$5000/MWh in VIC is lower than in NSW, QLD and SA. 130 Chapter 3.

Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets Overall, applying cross-extremograms to both half-hourly and 5-minute data, we ﬁnd the strongest extremal dependence between adjoining regional markets that are well connected through interconnectors, such as the pairs of NSW and QLD with two in- terconnectors, NSW and VIC with one interconnector, and SA and VIC with two interconnectors. This indicates that these pairs of markets have a strong tendency to exhibit extreme prices contemporaneously or jointly with certain time lags, i.e. strong and persistent spillover eﬀects of price spikes. On the other hand, signiﬁcantly lower extremal dependence is observed between prices of the markets that are geographically distant and not directly interconnected, such as QLD and SA, QLD and VIC, and SA and TAS. Interestingly, despite the existing Basslink interconnector between VIC and TAS, the extremal dependence between prices in these two regional markets is relatively low. This could be due to the diﬀerent operating strategy of Basslink as a merchant interconnector, compared to the other interconnectors which are regulated and government owned. Meanwhile, the substantially diﬀerent generation mix in TAS is also a contributing factor which leads to less price transmission eﬀects between TAS and other regional markets. Electricity in TAS is predominately generated from hydro power, while in the other markets, electricity generation is dominated by fossil fuel ﬁred power plants such as coal and gas, or by intermittent generation from wind in SA. In addition, the cross-extremograms between markets appear to be asymmetric. For example, conditioning on an extreme price in NSW, the probability of price spikes happening to VIC is generally insigniﬁcant except at short lags 0, 1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 3.6, Panel D). In contrast, conditioning on an extreme price in VIC, signiﬁcant probabilities of price spikes happening to NSW can be observed both contemporaneously and around the 48 th and 96 th lags, illustrating more persistent extremal dependence (Fig. 3.10, Panel A). Given the highest level of interconnection to the rest of the NEM, the high local generation capacity from brown coal with relatively low costs, and the large export ratio of VIC, this asymmetry in cross-extremograms reﬂects the higher ability of VIC to transmit out local extreme prices compared to that of NSW. Among all regions, the extreme price transmission from VIC to SA is the strongest. This reﬂects the fact that SA is highly reliant on importing electricity from VIC to ﬁrm its local supply because 136 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets of the large share of wind generation in SA and the high uncertainty of wind output due to its intermittent nature. 3.4.4 Case study: Impact of 2016 rebidding rule change This section applies extremograms to examine the impact of a particular market policy change – the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC)’s rebidding rule change (Australian Energy Market Commission, 2015) implemented on 1 July 2016. The existence of strategic bidding and rebidding behaviour in the Australian NEM has been documented in the literature and various industry reports, see, for example, Clements et al. (2016), Dungey et al. (2018) and Wood and Blowers (2018). The strategic behaviour is closely related to the current market setting, in particular, the half-hourly settlement and rebidding mechanism. As introduced in Section 3.2, the settlement prices (i.e. trading prices) that generators are paid at in the NEM are the half-hourly average prices, no matter in which ﬁve-minute period the generators dispatch their output. This means that as long as a generator is able to manufacture a 5-minute price spike, it can increase the proﬁt for its dispatch within the entire half-hour interval. In addition, since generators in the NEM are allowed to rebid at any time up to ﬁve minutes before dispatch, there is an opportunity for generators to obtain priority to dispatch and thus secure their proﬁt from their manufactured extreme prices. For example, Biggar (2011), Schwenen (2014) and Clements et al. (2016) provide empirical evidence on the attempt of baseload generators, who typically have higher market power and inﬂuence on the overall market supply and price, to maximise proﬁt by combining strategic bidding and rebidding. In particular, these generators ﬁrst push up the dispatch price by withholding capacity at low price levels and meanwhile bidding the remaining capacity at the price cap. After creating a price spike in the ﬁrst 5-minute dispatch interval, these generators then add capacity at the lowest price levels through the rebidding mechanism to ensure their dispatch priority within the same half-hourly interval, before their competitors are able to respond to the price 137 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets change. Strategic bidding and rebidding behaviour can result in various undesirable conse- quences for the market. As argued in Clements et al. (2016), Hurn et al. (2016) and Dungey et al. (2018), strategic behaviour in electricity markets leads to extreme price events which do not reﬂect the fundamental generation cost, inﬂate ﬁnal electricity settlement prices and signiﬁcantly increase market volatility. Furthermore, Clements et al. (2016) provide empirical evidence that strategic bidding substantially changes regional market supply conditions and can cause market anomalies such as electricity ﬂowing from a high price area to a low price area (i.e. the so-called counter-price ﬂow). Due to the concerns about the negative impacts of strategic rebidding, the AEMC im- plemented a rule change in 2016 which replaced the requirement that ‘oﬀers be made in good faith’ by a prohibition against making false or misleading oﬀers and put stronger restrictions on ‘last minute’ electricity market rebids. In particular, a new deﬁnition of the late rebidding period was inserted: the period beginning ﬁfteen minutes before the commencement of a half-hourly trading interval and ending at the end of this trading interval is a late rebidding period. The new rule also added a requirement on infor- mation disclosure of late rebids, that is, all rebids that are close to dispatch time have to be submitted with a reason and contemporaneous record of the circumstances that led to the necessity of late rebids. Furthermore, the rule change added restrictions on the timing of rebidding, i.e., any variation has to be made as soon as practicable after a change in material circumstances and conditions without delay. Strategic behaviour of generators and the rebidding rule change are relevant to our examination of extremal price dependence because, according to Hurn et al. (2016), isolated price spikes are more likely to be caused by strategic behaviour than those spikes continuing for more consecutive periods. In particular, artiﬁcial spikes can be eliminated within a short period as soon as other market competitors respond to it by adding supply, while extreme events led by real supply shortage (e.g. network outage or high demand) will persist until the underlying supply issue is resolved. Since the rule change with more restrictive timing and disclosure requirement is expected to 138 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets reduce strategic behaviour, price spikes in the post-rule-change period are expected to be more persistent than those in the pre-rule-change period. We therefore apply extremograms to validate this hypothesis and expect to see more isolated spikes in the pre-implementation period as well as more persistence in the post-implementation period. To examine the impact of the AEMC’s rule change on the persistence of price spikes in the NEM, we estimate univariate extremograms for the 2-year pre-rule-change period (1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016) and the 2-year post-rule-change period (1 July 2016 to 30 June 2018). The estimated extremograms are based on the 5-minute dispatch prices, because, compared to 30-minute prices which have been smoothed and possibly lowered by averaging across six 5-minute price intervals, 5-minute prices directly capture all price spikes and are able to reﬂect the persistence of extreme price events. Meanwhile, the A$5000/MWh threshold is used because, in order for generators to obtain a high half-hourly average price in the above described strategy, the price spike they create in a single 5-minute interval needs to be high enough to remain elevated after being averaged with ﬁve low prices from other dispatch intervals23. The results are presented in Figs. 3.16 and 3.17. It is shown that the extreme prices appear to be more persistent in the post-rule-change period than in the pre-rule-change period to the extent that signiﬁcant extremograms can be found in more consecutive lags in the post period. The increase in persistence is especially apparent for SA in Panel A of Fig. 3.16. Speciﬁcally, while there is only 10% probability of another spike happening in the next 5-minute interval given a price spike in SA in the pre-implementation period, in the post-implementation period the probability of a spike directly following another is as high as 42%. Furthermore, while extremograms for SA in the pre-implementation period decay to be insigniﬁcant rapidly after one lag (i.e. 5 minutes), extremograms in the post-implementation period become insigniﬁcant far more slowly, taking around 50 lags (approximately 4 hours). 23 To illustrate, assuming a price spike at A$6000/MWh occurs in the ﬁrst dispatch interval, even if the price drops to zero (i.e. (A$0)/MWh) for the remaining time of the whole 30-minute trading interval, the trading price is A$( 6000+5∗(0) 6 = 1000), which is signiﬁcantly higher than the typical spot prices in the NEM under normal conditions. 139 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets In addition to the extremogram analysis in Figs. 3.16 and 3.17, Table 3.2 describes the occurrence distribution of price spikes in order to validate the increased spike persistence indicated by the extremogram analysis. In particular, Table 3.2 counts the total occurrence of prices greater than A$5000/MWh for both the pre and post period and reports the number of half-hour intervals in which these spikes occur. The ‘Spikes per Interval’ column calculates the average spike count in a ‘spiky’ half-hour interval. According to the table, ﬁrstly, except QLD, there are more spikes observed in the post-implementation period. This is partly due to the higher volatility of the market itself in recent years, because of the exit of some major fossil-fuel ﬁred plants and the increasing share of intermittent renewable generations (Rai and Nelson, 2019). Recall that our focus is on the clustering or persistence of spikes (i.e. how close or how distant the spikes are to each other) rather than the total number of spikes. Although the number of half-hourly spiky intervals has also increased for each market except QLD, the extent of this increase is less than the increase in total spike counts. In NSW, for example, where the total spike count has increased three times in the post- implementation period compared to the pre-implementation period, the number of spiky half-hourly intervals has increased only about two times. As a result, the spike count per half-hourly interval (i.e. spikes happening in the same half-hourly interval) in the post-implementation period is higher than that in the pre-implementation period for all markets. This suggests that on average more spike clustering and persistence is observed in the NEM. In addition, ‘Events Count’ column in Table 3.2 shows the count of physical markets events relevant to price spikes during the pre-rule-change and post-rule-change period, respectively. Market events data are collected from AEMO’s published market notices (https://aemo.com.au/market-notices) on extraordinary market issues including demand shocks, short-term generation outage, transmission constraints. The results show that spikes in the post period are more likely to be related to signiﬁcant physical market events. These results validate the above ﬁndings for the estimated extremograms: in the post period, a larger proportion of spikes are persistent events rather than short-term or isolated ‘artiﬁcial’ events. The persistent spikes are likely caused by physical power system issues which require more time to 140 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets recover, while the latter are more likely to be the result of strategic bidding or rebidding. In summary, this section applies extremograms to investigate the impact of the AEMC’s 2016 rule change on generator rebidding. Our ﬁndings indicate a higher probability of observing isolated abnormally high price events in the pre-implementation period and, in comparison, a higher probability of observing persistent price spikes in the post-implementation period. This can be considered as an indication for less strategic behaviour after the rule change. Table 3.2: Price spikes which occurred in pre-rule-change period (1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016) and post-rule-change period (1 July 2016 to 30 June 2018). ‘Spike Count’ column counts the total occurrence of prices greater than A$5000/MWh; ‘Half-Hour Intervals’ column counts the number of half-hour intervals containing spikes; ‘Spikes per Interval’ refers to the mean spike count in a ‘spiky’ interval. For example, the ﬁrst row in Panel (a) shows that there were 15 price spikes in NSW during the pre-rule-change period which occurred in 7 distinct half-hour periods. On average, each of these half-hour periods contains 2.14 spikes. ‘Events Count’ column shows the count of markets events related to price spikes in the corresponding periods. Market events data are collected from AEMO’s published market notices (https://aemo.com.au/market-notices) on extraordinary market issues including demand shocks, short-term generation outage, transmission constraints. For example, in pre-rule-change period, the 15 spikes in NSW are related to 28 market events.

Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets 3.5 Conclusions We examine extremal dependence between spot electricity prices in diﬀerent regions in the Australian NEM, since the risk of extreme outcomes and joint price spikes in regional markets is of signiﬁcant concern to market participants. So far only a limited number of studies have concentrated on modelling the dependence within a single or between diﬀerent regional electricity markets with a particular focus on extreme obser- vations. We apply a relatively new econometric technique, the extremogram developed by Davis and Mikosch (2009) and Davis et al. (2011, 2012) to generate important in- sights on the nature of extreme price outcomes and their transmission in interconnected spot electricity markets. In particular, we examine the persistence of extreme price events, transmission eﬀects of price spikes between diﬀerent regions, and the impact of interconnection within the Australian NEM. Applying the extremogram to both half-hourly and 5-minute prices from July 2009 to June 2018, we ﬁnd that the extreme prices are more persistent in the market with the highest share of intermittent renewable energy such as SA, as well as in more concentrated markets such as QLD and TAS. We argue that limited intercon- nection capacity, high price volatility caused by intermittent generation, high supply costs due to market power of several local generators, and the potential inability to import electricity from other regions to replace local supply, are contributing factors to the occurrence of extreme price outcomes. These factors also contribute to higher levels of persistence for extreme prices within a regional market. The estimated extremal de- pendence for each region is typically stronger with a one-day time lag, which indicates that given an extreme price observation in an individual region, there is a relatively high possibility of another extreme outcome at around the same time on the next day. We also ﬁnd that extreme prices are transmitted between regions. These transmission eﬀects are typically more pronounced between adjoining and physically interconnected markets and show asymmetric patterns depending on the relative importance and size of the regional markets. Furthermore, the extent of extremal dependence in half-hourly 144 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets prices above A$300/WMh tends to be stronger than extremal dependence for 5-minute interval prices above A$5000/MWh. We further apply the extremogram method to investigate the impact of a particular market event: the AEMC’s 2016 rebidding rule change which was aimed at preventing strategic and misleading bidding behaviour. Our results show higher persistence of extreme prices after the implementation of the rule change, which aligns better with spikes caused by a real supply-demand relationship. This indicates some eﬀectiveness of the rule change in terms of reducing the strategic behaviour of market participants. Our study helps to provide a better understanding of the persistence of extreme price outcomes in individual electricity markets as well as the relationship between extreme events across regional electricity spot markets. This provides important insights for market participants, especially for those who simultaneously operate in diﬀerent re- gional markets in the NEM, in making their planning, trading and risk management decisions. Our results are also important for regulators in reducing unnecessarily high prices and market volatility as well as improving the eﬃciency of electricity pricing through eﬀective policy making and regulation of participant behaviours. Finally, there are some directions for future research. In the context of rapidly de- veloping storage facilities and demand response mechanisms, the application of ex- tremograms in demand management will be of interest to market participants. By incorporating the estimated extremal dependence of the spot price series, important implications can be gained on the optimal timing of operations including demand cur- tailment, the charging or discharging of large batteries, as well as for relevant revenue forecasting and the pricing of demand curtailment contracts. Meanwhile, given vari- ous available ﬁnancial derivatives related to electricity markets such as the ‘300 Cap Products’ discussed in Section 3.2 and interregional settlement residue auctions 24 which allow the future interregional price diﬀerence to be traded, application of extremograms in combination with derivatives to hedge the extreme price risk will also be valuable. In 24 For details of the interregional settlement residue auctions in the NEM, see https://aemo.com.au/en/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/market- operations/settlements-and-payments/settlements/settlements-residue-auction. 145 Chapter 3. Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets particular, relating the estimated extremograms of prices and the payoﬀ distribution of a hedged portfolio will provide important insights for market participants for eﬀective risk management. Furthermore, as discussed in Section 3.3, the sample extremogram provides important information for model selection by assessing the time series pat- terns of sample data. Evaluating the performance of an econometric framework in electricity markets, such as, e.g., GARCH type or regime-switching models, model se- lection informed by extremograms can provide interesting evidence on the eﬀectiveness of extremograms on capturing particular features in electricity price data. 146 References References Aderounmu, A.A., Wolﬀ, R., 2014a.

Uncertainty involved in this transition poses substantial challenges for market par- ticipants and regulators. This paper examines dispatch-weighted prices (DWP) and earnings-at-risk (EaR) for diﬀerent generation technologies in the Australian National Electricity Market. We ﬁnd that dispatchable generators such as hydro, natural gas, battery storage, kerosene and diesel oil plants with controllable and ﬂexible output achieve signiﬁcantly higher DWPs than less ﬂexible generators such as coal ﬁred power plants. They also achieve higher DWPs than variable renewable energy (VRE) genera- tors, i.e. solar and wind farms, which are non-dispatchable. Examining cashﬂow-based EaR measures, we further ﬁnd very diﬀerent risk proﬁles for diﬀerent generation tech- nologies. While dispatchable and ﬂexible generators with stronger correlation with spot prices have signiﬁcantly higher upside potential of earnings compared to coal ﬁred plants and VRE generators, their EaRs are also much higher, which indicates greater uncertainty in proﬁts. Furthermore, we ﬁnd seasonal variation in the DWPs and earn- ings of generators with higher uncertainty and dispersion observed in summer. Our analysis provides important insights to investors on decision making, hedging strate- gies and portfolio management, as well as to regulators on eﬀective planning to ensure sustainable and secure supply of electricity.

Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia 4.1 Introduction Electricity prices in Australia are currently among the highest on record (Wood et al., 2018), which has negative impacts not only on end-users such as private households and ﬁrms, but also on the entire economy. Elevated electricity prices are also related to the need for Australia to transition to a low carbon economy and signiﬁcantly reduce emissions from electricity generation. In particular, in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), there is a substantial transformation from fossil fuel ﬁred power generation to an increasing share of renewable energy. While the NEM is still dominated by large scale fossil fuel ﬁred generators, a consid- erable number of older generators are close to the end of their service life, becoming less reliable and gradually shutting down (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018a). As pointed out by O’Gorman and Jotzo (2014), Naziﬁ et al. (2017), Maryniak et al. (2019) and Rai and Nelson (2020b), due to concerns of regulatory uncertainty such as car- bon emission policies, change of demand proﬁle and technology induced risk such as development of cheaper storage units, there has only been very limited investment in new generation assets, in particular ‘dispatchable’ generators which are controllable and ﬂexible. The lack of investment in additional dispatchable generation, combined with the shut-down of major coal ﬁred power plants, has had a negative eﬀect on the Australian electricity sector. In particular, as reported in Rai and Nunn (2020), over 4.1 GigaWatts of coal ﬁred generators have exited the NEM within a short period of three years from 2014 to 2017. This sudden and unexpected exit of high capacity factor plants has removed a signiﬁcant share of the excess capacity which had been in place since the NEM commenced in late 1998. Subsequently, electricity prices in the NEM nearly doubled between 2016 and 2018. There had been another spiky period in the NEM’s history between 2007 and 2008 when Australia’s millennium drought forced some coal ﬁred plants to be mothballed due to the shortage of cooling water. However, this spiky period was transitory since substantial additional gas ﬁred generation was added to 157 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia the NEM between 2008 and 2009. In contrast to the 2007-2008 period, as noted by Rai and Nelson (2020a), a lack of entry of new dispatchable generation in response to increased price volatility since 2017 in the NEM has led wholesale prices to remain elevated till 2019. On the other hand, much of the gap that resulted from the exit of coal ﬁred plants has been ﬁlled by a signiﬁcant volume of newly entered renewable energy generators, among which over 90% are variable renewable energy (VRE) plants such as wind and solar farms with intermittent and ‘non-dispatchable’ output. Speciﬁcally, over 7,500MW of newly built utility-scale wind and solar stations have started operating in the NEM over the period from July 2012 to June 2019 (Rai and Nunn, 2020). The increased output from newly built renewable power plants has only moderated the spot prices to a limited extent, since the uncertainty in the availability of natural resources such as wind speed and solar radiation has introduced further volatility to the market. Both signiﬁcant opportunity and risk exist under current market conditions of high price levels and signiﬁcant price volatility in the NEM, which vary signiﬁcantly for diﬀerent generation technologies. While there are concerns about the large volume of fossil fuel ﬁred plants exiting the NEM and the lack of dispatchable plants entering the market, Rai and Nunn (2020) ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant but non-transparent premium for being dispatchable exists in the NEM. For dispatchable generators such as coal and gas ﬁred stations, quantiﬁcation of future proﬁt potential is important for decision-making on entering or exiting the market. For non-dispatchable VREs such as wind and solar, due to the highly uncertain pro- duction volume caused by dependence on weather conditions, assessment of their prof- itability and risks is important for evaluating new investment and appropriate pricing of long-term contracts such as Power Purchase Agreements which are often used by variable power plants to secure a pre-determined price for their supply. In addition, the increasing share of renewable generation also imposes signiﬁcant in- 158 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia vestment risk on other power plant types since the intermittency and high volatility of VRE production substantially inﬂuence wholesale prices and the residual demand for other generators whose revenue thus becomes more volatile. On the one hand, Cutler et al. (2011) and Hirth (2013) ﬁnd that periods of high wind or solar output are typically associated with lower spot prices and can contribute to signiﬁcant nega- tive prices. On the other hand, high penetration of VREs also induces extreme price outcomes when insuﬃcient natural resources are available, which leads to signiﬁcant price volatility in the market (Astaneh and Chen, 2013; Martinez-Anido et al., 2016). Examining possible earnings under both low price periods and extreme price scenar- ios is particularly signiﬁcant for generators with higher fuel costs such as natural gas, kerosene and diesel oil stations which earn proﬁt mainly during high price scenarios and receive little or zero revenue with subdued prices which can persist for an extended time period. Examination of earnings variation for these generators is important for their hedging strategy. Furthermore, as suggested by the Australian Energy Market Operator (2017, 2019b), suﬃcient investment should be delivered in both renewable and dispatchable resources to achieve a low cost and low emission economy and maintain a suﬃcient and secure power supply. However, dispatchable generation is currently under-invested due to a lack of investment incentive and various uncertainties inﬂuencing revenue (Rai and Nelson, 2020b). Examining the earning and risk proﬁle of each technology in the cur- rent market context is thus essential for eﬀective energy planning and energy portfolio optimisation from a regulator’s perspective. This study aims to provide a better understanding of earnings and risks for diﬀerent generation assets and technologies. More speciﬁcally, we evaluate the proﬁtability of each generation technology through the dispatch-weighted price (DWP) it receives and the upside potential of earnings it can achieve. We also quantify and compare investment risks for diﬀerent generation technologies by estimating their earnings-at- risk (EaR) which places an emphasis on measuring the variability in the accumulated revenues obtained by a power plant over a deﬁned time period. A stationary bootstrap 159 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia algorithm developed by Politis and Romano (1994), Politis and White (2004) and Patton et al. (2009) is adopted to simulate potential price paths and the dispatch for individual power plants. Since typical energy portfolios may contain various generation assets, fuel supply agreements, retail contracts and customised hedging, and are hard to value, monetise or become readily tradable, EaR as a cashﬂow based risk measure is more relevant compared to the widely used Value-at-Risk measure. With a unique dataset, containing generations of each power plant for every half-hour interval in the NEM spot market, we focus on two diﬀerent regional markets: the largest market in the NEM in New South Wales that is still dominated by generation from coal ﬁred plants, and the market in South Australia that has shut-down all generation from coal and relies mainly on generation from renewable energy and gas ﬁred power plants. We ﬁnd that generators using hydro, natural gas, battery storage, kerosene or diesel oil achieve signiﬁcantly higher DWPs than coal ﬁred plants or VRE generators. Consider- ing the base load, intermediate and peak load generator groups respectively, dispatch prices of generations based on renewable energy are relatively low compared to conven- tional generations from fossil fuels. In addition, generators with stronger correlation with spot prices such as hydro, natural gas, battery storage, kerosene and diesel oil stations have signiﬁcantly higher upside potential of earnings compared to generators using coal, wind or solar. However, they also have much higher EaRs which indicates greater uncertainties in their proﬁts, especially in a less volatile market scenario. The results indicate decreased proﬁtability of traditional coal ﬁred generators in recent mar- ket conditions. On the other hand, the lower cost and earnings variation of renewable generation, both when they are used for base load and peak load purposes, suggest a great potential for new investment in renewable power plants, especially VRE power plants in combination with dispatchable renewable generators or storage facilities. The remainder of this study is structured as follows. Section 4.2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 4.3 introduces the market mechanisms and generation technologies in the Australian NEM. Section 4.4 describes the research methodology, including the 160 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia calculation of DWPs, algorithms for the bootstrap procedure and the estimation of EaRs. Section 4.5 reports the statistical properties of the data used in this study and provides some preliminary results. Empirical results are presented in Section 4.6, including estimated DWPs and earnings for diﬀerent types of generator as well as simulation results for EaRs. Finally, Section 4.7 concludes and discusses the key results and implications of these ﬁndings. 4.2 Literature review Three interlinked streams of literature regarding evaluation of revenue and risk of diﬀerent generation technologies are related to this study. The ﬁrst stream of literature assesses the investment risk and return proﬁle by simu- lating or modelling various risk factors from a new entrant’s perspective. Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) are typically used by these type of studies as investment decision tools. Policy uncertainty, especially various support schemes, as an important incentive for renewable energy investments and a risk factor that inﬂuences the revenue and return proﬁle of a new investment in renewable stations is quantiﬁed by Williges et al. (2010), Yang et al. (2010) and Gatzert and Vogl (2016). In addition, comparing diﬀerent schemes, Kitzing (2014) and Kitzing and Weber (2014) argue that a feed-in-tariﬀ is favourable in comparison to a feed-in-premium, because investors are exposed to price risks under a feed-in-premium and require a higher return which leads to higher support costs. Jarait˙e and Kažukauskas (2013) and Bunn and Yusupov (2015) suggest that investment risk for wind plants is reduced under a trad- able green certiﬁcate scheme, since the negative correlation between wind output risk and price risk provides a natural hedge which would be eliminated by the ﬁxed price under a feed-in-tariﬀ. An increased share of renewable generation in the market, on the other hand, leads to higher investment risks due to higher price volatility caused by the variable output of renewable generators (Green and Vasilakos, 2010; Cutler et al., 2011; Green et al., 2011). Muñoz and Bunn (2013) apply Monte Carlo simulation and 161 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia ﬁnd signiﬁcantly higher risks for investors of wind, gas and nuclear plants to satisfy their debt coverage ratios. For VREs availability of natural resource is an important risk factor of production and revenue (Morthorst, 1999; Kaldellis and Gavras, 2000; Montes and Martín, 2007). Cutler et al. (2011) assess the uncertainty of wind power proﬁtability by simulating wind speed, assuming a feed-in-tariﬀ (i.e. a guaranteed electricity price). A conditional Value-at-Risk of IRR is calculated to provide information on the probabilities for a range of IRRs. Katsigiannis and Stavrakakis (2014) examine the proﬁtability of using diﬀerent wind turbine classes in three sites in Australia with low, low to medium, and medium to high potential of wind speed, respectively. While the above studies put more focus on the return or revenue of a potential investment, the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) as a measure of the average net present cost of electricity production for a power plant over its life cycle is widely used by industry reports and in the literature (Joskow, 2011; Ueckerdt et al., 2013; Ouyang and Lin, 2014; Pawel, 2014; Hirth et al., 2016; Partridge, 2018). It is a uniformly comparable measure for costs of diﬀerent generation technologies in diﬀerent countries or markets. Various factors inﬂuencing LCOEs of diﬀerent generation technologies are discussed in Partridge (2018), including shares of renewable generation in the market, fuel costs for fossil fuel generations, operating and maintenance costs and cost of capital. The study also points out a key advantage of renewable power plants, i.e. the fact that they are not exposed to the price volatility of fossil fuels (especially gas). The second stream of literature applies portfolio theory to the energy market and fo- cuses on optimising a portfolio of energy plants by examining their correlations and cost-return proﬁles. Speciﬁcally, Awerbuch and Berger (2003), Huang and Wu (2008), Muñoz et al. (2009), Westner and Madlener (2010), Arnesano et al. (2012), Lynch et al. (2013) and Cucchiella et al. (2017) optimise energy planning through return maximisa- tion, while Allan et al. (2011), Delarue et al. (2011), Bhattacharya and Kojima (2012), DeLlano-Paz et al. (2015) and Zhang et al. (2018) seek to identify optimal weights for diﬀerent power plants by minimising portfolio costs and associated risks. Tietjen 162 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia et al. (2016) suggest that capital intensive VRE plants have higher stand-alone risks than fossil fuel ﬁred plants due to high price risk. However, incorporating VREs in the ﬁrm’s portfolio reduces the overall risk because of their hedge eﬀect against losses from fossil fuel plants. However, the authors also argue that this beneﬁt decreases with an increasing share of VREs in the market. In the Australian context, Vithayasrichareon et al. (2009) examine the costs of a portfolio constructed by coal and diﬀerent gas plants under diﬀerent scenarios of fuel and carbon prices. Vithayasrichareon et al. (2015) and Riesz et al. (2015) investigate the eﬀectiveness of using renewable genera- tors for risk diversiﬁcation and to minimise the costs of electricity for customers. Some literature further assesses the complementarity of diﬀerent renewable energy types to create synergy when a combination of renewable plants are included in the portfolio, such as wind with solar (Prasad et al., 2017; Gallardo et al., 2020) and wind with hydro (Denault et al., 2009; Hirth, 2016). The third stream of literature examines the market value or performance of diﬀerent types of power plants based on actual market prices and generations. Schmalensee (2016) examines the performance regarding capacity factors, intermittency and output value of 25 wind and 9 solar plants in seven independent system operators (ISOs) in the US. The ﬁndings of this study suggest that the performance of power plants varies signiﬁcantly within and between diﬀerent ISOs, depending on the site, weather conditions and time period. Various studies (Hirth, 2013, 2016; Hirth and Radebach, 2016; Eising et al., 2020; Prol et al., 2020) calculate DWPs of power plants or the ratio of DWP to market price (i.e. value factor) as an indicator of the market value and ﬁnd that the market value of VRE plants diminishes with increasing penetration, which is referred to as a cannibalisation eﬀect. Hirth (2016) compares the cannibalisation eﬀects of wind in a thermal power dominated market in Germany and in a hydro power dominated market in Sweden. The results show that although the market value of wind generation declines with increased penetration in both markets, hydro power signiﬁcantly mitigates the drop in value. Prol et al. (2020) compare the cannibalisation eﬀects of wind and solar farms in the wholesale electricity market in California. The time series analysis based on hourly day-ahead market data shows that while wind 163 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia penetration undermines the market value of solar generation as measured by value factor, solar penetration tends to increase the value factor of wind. In the Australian context, Rai and Nunn (2020) compare the diﬀerence between DWPs obtained by wind farms and dispatchable generators in South Australia. They ﬁnd a signiﬁcant premium received by dispatchable generators which has more than doubled between 2014 and 2019. Riesz et al. (2011) examine the relationship between solar plant revenue and the average NEM pool price in diﬀerent periods of day, seasons and years. The authors ﬁnd that solar plant revenues are more correlated with pool prices during peak time (8am - 6pm) than the average pool prices, and more correlated with peak prices in summer than in winter. Meanwhile, although extreme price occasions contribute substantially to the revenue of both wind and solar generators, the contribution is more signiﬁcant for solar generators. Overall, this study contributes to the existing literature in three ways. First, by cal- culating the average dispatch prices (i.e. DWPs) for each individual power station of diﬀerent generation technologies, we provide a comprehensive comparison of revenue- risk proﬁle for various types of electricity generation. Second, we complement and extend studies by Riesz et al. (2011), Schmalensee (2016) and Rai and Nunn (2020) and consider the proﬁtability and market value of power plants from a risk management perspective. Our analysis is based on an extensive simulation study that examines the distributional properties of DWPs and cash-ﬂow related measures such as earnings and EaRs. Third, using more recent data, our results generate important insights on gen- erator earnings and risks which are relevant in the current NEM market context that involves highly volatile spot prices as well as signiﬁcant changes in the generation mix and reserve capacity. 164 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia 4.3 The Australian National Electricity Market 4.3.1 The wholesale electricity market The Australian NEM commenced as a wholesale market in December 1998 with the objectives of promoting the eﬃciency of the electricity sector and reducing the costs of electricity production (Productivity Commission, 2013). It is now operating as a na- tionally integrated market supplying electricity to ﬁve state-based regional markets in New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA), Tasmania (TAS) and Victoria (VIC). Regional markets in the NEM are interconnected via transmission lines (i.e. interconnectors) and electricity is thus able to be traded between adjacent states from low price areas to high price areas. Unlike many electricity markets in Europe, for example, Nord Pool or the European Energy Exchange (Weron, 2006), the Australian NEM is not a day-ahead market. Instead it operates as a spot market managed by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) where demand is met in real-time (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018a). The spot market in the NEM is an ‘energy only’ gross pool such that all generated electricity has to be traded through the NEM. In particular, generators in the NEM submit bids every half hour, specify- ing the oﬀered electricity amount and price according to their available capacity and generating cost. The AEMO then determines the generators to be dispatched based on a least-cost optimisation approach, where generators with lower marginal costs are given priority. A dispatch price is determined every ﬁve minutes, and the spot market price is calculated as the average of six dispatch prices for every half-hourly interval for each regional market based on the marginal costs of the most expensive generator dispatched. Generators in the same region are paid uniformly at the regional spot price for their dispatched output (ignoring transmission and distribution costs). The Australian NEM comprises some of the most volatile spot electricity markets in the world (Higgs and Worthington, 2008; Mayer and Trück, 2018). Due to the non-storable nature of electricity, infrequent but signiﬁcant price spikes are observed in the market, 165 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia which are typically caused by demand shocks such as, e.g., peak load during extreme weather conditions as well as by supply disruptions due to, e.g., the outage of genera- tion plants and transmission failures. Within a period of as short as 30 minutes, the spot price can increase substantially and fall back as long as the demand shock or sup- ply disruption disappears. For example, in our sample period between 2017 and 2019, while the normal price level in the NEM is around or below A$100/MWh, there have been several occasions in each regional market when spot prices were close to or reached the market price cap, which was A$14200/MWh, A$14500/MWh and A$14700/MWh in the 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 ﬁnancial year respectively. In addition, electric- ity spot prices typically exhibit strong seasonality which is mainly driven by cyclical demand ﬂuctuations, corresponding to changes in, for example, weather conditions or business and household activities (Weron, 2006). Speciﬁcally, electricity prices are typ- ically higher in summer and winter 25. Intra-weekly and intra-daily patterns are also observed due to higher electricity demand on weekdays and during business operating hours. 4.3.2 Generation technologies in the Australian NEM The NEM uses a wide range of diﬀerent generation technologies to produce electricity. While fossil fuel generators such as coal or gas ﬁred plants still dominate, renewable generators including wind, solar, and hydro are supplying an increasing share of elec- tricity to the market. Depending on the varying characteristics of diﬀerent generation technologies, generations in the NEM can be typically classiﬁed into four types, includ- ing base load generation with high capital cost and low fuel cost which is generally slow to start or shutdown, peak load generation with lower capital cost and higher fuel cost which is fast to start, intermediate (or mid-merit) generation which is more expensive than base load generation but cheaper than peak load generation, and intermittent generation relying on the availability of variable natural resources. 25 The seasonal pattern can be observed in the time series plots for NEM spot prices provided in the Fig. 4.A.1 in Appendix. Meanwhile, signiﬁcant price spikes can be observed in summer and some periods in winter. 166 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia In particular, coal ﬁred plants have relatively low operating costs, however they can be slow and expensive to start. Therefore, coal ﬁred generators are typically used to supply base load and operate continuously. In comparison, natural gas ﬁred generators can be switched on and oﬀ with relatively short notice, making them suitable for peak load generation. However, the use of gas generation can be constrained by the high operating costs. Speciﬁcally, two technologies that are mainly used in the NEM for gas generation are the traditional open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) and combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) which uses the exhaust heat from OCGT units to generate steam and drive a turbine26. The use of waste heat increases the plant eﬃciency of CCGTs. Therefore, although OCGT plants are cheaper to construct, they are typically used to meet peak demand because of their lower thermal eﬃciency and higher ﬂexibility, and thus tend to operate at a lower capacity factor. In comparison, CCGTs are becoming the dominant choice for gas ﬁred generation to meet base to intermediate load (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019a). Hydro stations use the force of running water to generate electricity. Hydro plants have low operating costs and are used for both base load and peak load generations since they can provide dispatchable power when required to support the security of the system. However, the ﬁnite water to draw on determines that this type of plant cannot operate continuously and hydro power stations are reliant on the rainfall levels to replenish their storage. Intermittent generations from VREs, such as wind and solar, have low operating costs but are considered as ‘non-dispatchable’ since their output is not controllable and the plants can operate only under favourable weather conditions. Large scale battery storage was introduced to the NEM in December 2017 and is mainly used for reserve or peak load generation. Although the currently built battery capacity is relatively low, the growth in intermittent generations in the NEM 26 There are other types of natural gas ﬁred plants in the NEM, such as TORRIS which uses sub- critical steam turbines and BARKIPS which uses a reciprocating engine in SA. However, BARKIPS only started in our markets in October 2019 with a less than three-month sample period. The sub- critical steam turbine technology used by TORRIS is relatively old and ineﬃcient with less investment interest. Over one third of TORRIS’s capacity is scheduled to be mothballed by 2021 (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018a). As reported by McConnell (2017), compared to TORRIS, theoretically around 50% more energy can be delivered by the newer CCGT plant (NPPPPS) with the same unit of gas burned. Therefore, the focus of our discussion is on OCGT and CCGT generation. 167 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia creates great potential for battery storage to provide fast response security services when generations from wind and solar ﬂuctuate. In addition, the ability of battery storage to charge itself during low price periods and dispatch stored power during high price periods makes this technology more attractive. Other technologies, such as kerosene and diesel oil which are expensive but quickly responsive to price changes, are also used in the NEM to supply peak load demand, with a much lower available capacity. 4.3.3 Registered and actual generation mix in the NEM Fig. 4.1 compares the registered generation capacity in the NEM at the beginning of 2014 and at the end of 2019. As pointed out by Rai and Nelson (2020a), signiﬁcant changes have occurred in the NEM generation mix between 2014 and 2017, i.e. before the start of our sample period. As can be observed, considerable capacity from coal ﬁred generation has been removed from NSW (around 2,000MW), SA (around 500MW) and VIC (around 2,000MW). The gap has been ﬁlled by renewable generation mainly from wind and solar plants. In particular, the capacity from wind and solar generators has increased by around 2,000MW in NSW. More than 2,000MW of new renewable capacity which is mainly solar farms has been introduced in QLD. In SA, coal ﬁred generation has been fully withdrawn and around 1,000MW of additional capacity from wind farms has been introduced. In VIC, close to 2,000MW of capacity has been added, primarily from wind. In addition, a small capacity of battery storage has been built and started operating both in SA and VIC. As a result, the current actual generation share of diﬀerent technologies during our sample period for NSW and SA is shown in Fig. 4.2. Note that NSW and SA are the two regional markets considered in the empirical analysis in this study. While the share of black coal in the entire registered capacity in NSW is around 60% (Fig. 4.1), Fig. 4.2 illustrates that black coal stations typically provide over 80% of the total generation in NSW. Over the sample period, the share of black coal output 168 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia A: Registered capacity in the NEM (January 2014) B: Registered capacity in the NEM (December 2019) Fig. 4.1: Generation mix – registered capacity. Authors’ calculation based on data obtained from AEMO. exhibits a gradual decreasing trend, together with an increasing output share of wind and solar. Similarly in SA, the share of natural gas generation tends to decrease slightly through time, while solar generations started in mid-2018 and increased their output share gradually. In addition, notably from Fig. 4.2, as typical peak load generators, gas generation increases signiﬁcantly when the outputs from base load generators (such as black coal in Panel A) and intermittent generators (such as wind generators in Panel B) drop or are insuﬃcient to meet demand. Thus, generation from gas-ﬁred power plants ﬁrms and stabilises the overall supply.

Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia 4.3.4 Capacity factor Table 4.1 reports the annual capacity factor for each generation technology in NSW and SA. The capacity factor of a power plant is calculated as the ratio of its actual output over a period of time to the amount of output it would have produced at full nameplate capacity (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018b). It varies greatly, depending on the technology of generation, and measures the extent that a plant’s capacity is used. The mean capacity factor of plants in each technology group is then calculated. The capacity factor is important in cost estimation for power plants. A smaller capacity factor usually contributes to higher LCOE since ﬁxed costs induced by generation are allocated across the volume of electricity produced by a power plant (Australian Energy Regulator, 2018b). As base load generators in NSW, coal ﬁred power plants have the highest capacity factor at 62.99%, indicating a generally high usage of their generation capacity over time. Capacity factors of wind, solar and hydro generations which are dependent on the availability of natural resources are generally lower and tend to be site speciﬁc. In particular, with superior wind resources in SA (Lovegrove et al., 2018), the state has the highest wind penetration and the capacity factor of wind farms in SA is higher than in NSW. In comparison, with more solar farms built in NSW, the mean capacity factor of solar plants is higher in NSW than in SA. The low capacity factor of gas ﬁred generators in NSW indicates that they are not typ- ically used to produce base load power. Note that capacity factors for the two major gas generation technologies, i.e. OCGT and CCGT, are also calculated so that their diﬀerence can be analysed. The capacity factor of stations using CCGTs is generally higher compared to those using OCGTs. In particular, in SA where coal ﬁred gener- ators have all exited the market, while OCGTs as peak load generators still have low capacity factor, the capacity factor of CCGT stations is as high as 65.73% on average which exceeds the capacity factor of black coal in NSW. This reﬂects the high usage of CCGT generations to support base and intermediate load generation in SA. In ad- dition, the extremely low capacity factors of kerosene, diesel oil and battery storage stations indicate that they do not typically dispatch and only generate under peak 170 Chapter 4.

Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia 4.4 Methodology In this study, to assess the potential proﬁtability and risk involved in the investment in diﬀerent generation technologies, our methodology consists of examining both the DWP and the earning for each technology over a particular period. A bootstrap procedure is applied to examine the distributional properties of the DWPs and earnings for each generation type and market. As a measure of risk, EaR is assessed for each generation technology based on the bootstrapped earnings distributions. 4.4.1 Dispatch-weighted prices (DWPs) The DWP, as a volume-weighted average price, is a commonly used measure incorpo- rating the impact of dispatched volume on the prices received by market participants (Cutler et al., 2011; Australian Energy Regulator, 2018a; Rai and Nunn, 2020). The pricing mechanism in the NEM as described in Section 4.3 determines that all gen- erators in the same regional market receive identical regional market prices for their output during the same half-hourly interval, ignoring transmission and distribution losses. In comparison, DWPs across diﬀerent generators are generally diﬀerent due to the variations in their dispatched output and can be considered as an indicator of the earnings ability of diﬀerent generators. In particular, for an individual power station s let t denote the half-hourly time index, Pt, the spot pool price in the NEM measured in dollars per Megawatt-hour (MWh), and Q s t the dispatch of a station mea- sured in Megawatt (MW). Then the DWP for this station for a given time horizon which contains T half-hourly intervals is calculated as DW P s T = T∑ t=1 Pt × Q s t T∑ t=1 Q s t . (4.1) 172 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia 4.4.2 Earnings-at-risk (EaR) In order to assess the proﬁtability of diﬀerent generation technologies in the NEM from a risk management perspective, we apply an Earnings-at-Risk approach, which is a variation of the most widely used tool in the ﬁnancial risk domain - the Value- at-Risk (VaR). VaR measures the possible loss in value (i.e. the minimum possible return) of a risky ﬁnancial asset or portfolio over a deﬁned time interval with a given conﬁdence level. It is particularly preferred by regulators in the banking and ﬁnance sectors, since it allows institutions to assess and report their risk exposure regularly or for a particular time horizon. The concept of a VaR was initially introduced by Markowitz (1952) and Roy (1952), gaining signiﬁcant popularity after 1996 when the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision established VaR as an oﬃcial tool to be used by banks to measure risk exposure and determine capital requirements to back their trading activities. A key aspect in estimating VaR is to deﬁne the probability distribution of individual risk factors that have impact on the asset values and to further estimate the poten- tial losses for a given conﬁdence interval. To compensate for scarcity of knowledge about probability distributions of market variables often simulations are used. There are three typical streams of VaR studies in the literature (Sadeghi and Shavvalpour, 2006), namely, the variance-covariance method (Hull and White, 1998), the historical simulation approach and Monte Carlo simulation. The variance-covariance approach assumes that potential losses are in proportion to return volatility. VaR is measured based on the estimated return and variance of asset returns, covariance between as- sets, and asset weights. The focus of VaR calculation is thus on the estimation of the return volatility of assets or portfolios. Within this stream Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) type and generalised ARCH (GARCH) models are most widely used, see, e.g. Aloui and Mabrouk (2010), Cheng and Hung (2011) and Chkili et al. (2014). These type of VaR models are usually criticised for their assumptions that returns or return innovations follow a certain distribution (Abad et al., 2014; Halkos and Tsirivis, 2019). 173 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia Historical simulation is a widely used non-parametric approach which aims to estimate VaR without imposing strong assumptions on the distribution of returns, see, for ex- ample, Cabedo and Moya (2003); Sadeghi and Shavvalpour (2006); Chen et al. (2019). Instead, it assumes that the recent past and the near future can be considered as suf- ﬁciently similar so that the risk of the portfolio in the near future can be estimated based on the recent past (Halkos and Tsirivis, 2019). This stream of methods use the empirical distributions of returns and thus, given a (1 − α) conﬁdence interval, V aR is estimated as the αth quantile. In a similar way, Monte Carlo simulation also derives an empirical distribution for asset returns or other relevant risk factors to calculate VaR at a given quantile. However, it assumes a particular statistical distribution for risk factors, and random movements of these factors are generated. Monte Carlo simulation is also a widely used method for measuring the risk of a portfolio, see, for example, Andersson et al. 2001; Roques et al. 2008; Andriosopoulos and Nomikos 2012. The method has the advantage of its ﬂexibility that enables researchers to account for path dependent behaviour such as volatility clustering and certain factors inﬂuencing future conditions of the market. Criticisms of this approach include its computationally intensive nature when multi- ple risk factors are involved and that, although Monte Carlo simulations are usually considered as more sophisticated than the historical simulation approach, a number of applications in essence directly make their distribution assumptions based on historical data (Damodaran, 2007; Dewynne and Davy, 2008). In a recent study on determining risk measures with Monte Carlo simulation, Ardia et al. (2017) suggest that mini- mum variance or maximum diversiﬁcation portfolios were particularly sensitive to a misspeciﬁcation of the variance-covariance matrix. This study applies a bootstrap historical simulation approach which is an extension of basic historical simulation. We decided to apply this approach, given the complex dynamic behaviour of spot electricity prices and the advantage of historical simulation not relying on particular parametric assumptions on the distribution of the variables. According to a survey conducted by Pérignon and Smith (2010), 73% of sixty Amer- 174 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia ican, Canadian and major institutional banks over the ten year period from 1996 to 2005 used historical simulations to generate their VaR measurement. As stressed by Laker et al. (2017), estimation of extreme risks typically has challenges such as the consideration of dependence within data and the lack of information on tails. There- fore, given the rare but re-occurring extreme price outcomes in Australian electricity markets, a nonparametric approach might be preferred over a parametric one. With- out a predeﬁned distribution assumption, the applied bootstrap historical simulation approach well accommodates the skewness, wide tails, volatility persistence and other non-normal features of our electricity market data. Furthermore, it caters for the stationarity and dependence features in the data. Despite the popularity of VaR in ﬁnancial markets, in the context of electricity markets, cashﬂow based alternatives to the VaR measure such as earnings-at-risk (EaR) (Denton et al., 2003) which measures the uncertainty of earnings in the future and cashﬂow-at- risk (CFaR) (Stein et al., 2001; Andrén et al., 2005) which can monitor the variability of cashﬂows at each point in time are more appropriate measures due to the speciﬁc features of electricity markets: ﬁrst, the VaR measure is typically derived from the change of asset prices at the end of a predeﬁned time horizon, while cashﬂows generated within the period are not considered. However, for many energy market participants, a typical portfolio may contain generation assets, fuel supply agreements, power purchase agreements, retail contracts and customised hedging. The value of this type of portfolio can remain relatively stable over the considered time interval, while cashﬂows are highly relevant to the proﬁtability and ability for continuous operation of an energy ﬁrm. Second, a large part of the assets in the aforementioned energy portfolio are diﬃcult to monetise and not readily tradable, making the VaR measure much less relevant than cashﬂow based risk measures. In addition, cashﬂow based measures, in practice, are generally more meaningful to the board of ﬁrms since they are more consistent with ﬁnancial reports and budgets. Finally, in electricity markets, the two risk factors, the price and load, represent the relationship between supply and demand, which leads to a functional dependence with the price of power generation.This also makes a cash-ﬂow based measure such as EaR or CFaR preferable over VaR. 175 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia While CFaR puts more focus on the timing of cashﬂows, our aim is to assess the prof- itability and risk of investments on diﬀerent generation assets where the accumulated earnings over a given time interval are more relevant, the EaR approach is therefore used in this study and the detailed calculation is described in the following. Given the half-hourly time index t, spot price Pt, station s and dispatch of the station Q s t at time t, the earnings at t are Es t = 0.5 × Q s t × Pt, (4.2) where the factor of 0.5 is used to represent the half-hourly horizon. Given a time period that is of interest which contains T half-hour intervals in total, the earnings for this period are Es T = T∑ t=1 Es t . (4.3) With a bootstrapping procedure conducted based on the Pt and Q s t which is described in Section 4.4.3, a random variable Es T can be constructed and an empirical distribution can be obtained. In the next step, we deﬁne EaR as the possible loss in proportion of expected earnings given a conﬁdence level (1 − α), which is illustrated in Eq. (4.4) EaRs T = E(Es T ) − qs α E(Es T ) . (4.4) The expected earnings made in the considered period E(Es T ) are measured as the mean of earnings Es T from all bootstrapping trials (see Section 4.4.3); qs α refers to the quantile corresponding to the selected conﬁdence level. Note that diﬀerent generation technologies, due to the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in their capacity and output, will have substantially diﬀerent calculated EaRs in dollars which are not comparable to each other. In this study EaR is measured in percentage form as a proportion of expected earnings for this reason 27. 27 It is worth noting that the applied EaR measure based on historical bootstrapping could ignore a 176 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia In a similar way, we further assess the upside potential of each generation technology, i.e. the possible proﬁt obtained in excess to the expected earnings, by looking at the right side of the earnings distribution. U pside P otentials T = qs 1−α − E(Es T ) E(Es T ) (4.5) Fig. 4.3 illustrates the obtained distribution of earnings, EaR and the upside poten- tial of earnings, when the described bootstrap approach is applied for a wind station (SNOWTOWN in SA) as an example. Fig. 4.3: Calculation of EaR and Upside Potential according to Eqs. (4.4) and (4.5). 4.4.3 The bootstrapping procedure for EaR We apply a stationary bootstrap of Politis and Romano (1994) to estimate EaR of diﬀerent technologies and to examine the distribution properties of the DWP that each generation technology can expect to get for a certain future period. A potential problem of traditional ﬁxed length block bootstrapping is that the resam- pling procedure may eliminate the stationarity of the data series (Laker et al., 2017). potential value, created by certain generators through strategic bidding behaviours (see Clements et al. (2016) and Dungey et al. (2018) for typical bidding strategies). A potential future extension would be to simulate generators’ bidding behaviours and account for the value of strategic behaviour before estimating EaRs. 177 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia The stationary bootstrap overcomes this by using a random block length approximated by a geometric distribution. Speciﬁcally, consider an original sample with N obser- vations X = {X1, X2, ..., XN } which is a weakly dependent and stationary process. Next, let L = {L1, L2, ..., LK} be a series of random variables which are independent and identically distributed with a geometric distribution P (Lk = m) = (1 − p) m−1p, where p ∈ (0, 1]. Independently of both X and L, I = {I1, I2, ..., IK} is a sequence of iid random variables with a uniform distribution U N IF (1, N ). Let K be the small- est integer which leads to L1 + L2 + ... + LK ≥ N . Then a stationary bootstrapped pseudo series X ∗ can be constructed by taking K blocks of sequential subsamples from X with the kth block represented by Bk = {XIk, XIk+1, ..., XIk+Lk−1}, which means a block containing Lk observations starting from XIk. Hence, the full re-sampled series can be represented by {X ∗ 1 , X ∗ 2 , ..., X ∗ N } ≡ {B1, B2, ..., BK}. Note that circular block schemes are usually used such that all original observations have the same probability of being selected. Meanwhile, by deﬁnition, it is possible that L1 + L2 + ... + LK > N in which case the length of the K th block will be truncated to ensure exact N obser- vations in the re-sampled series. In addition, depending on the length of the future period of interest, in practice the simulated data length can be greater or shorter than the original sample length N . This procedure preserves the property of stationarity in the dataset, and also accounts for features such as serial dependence and seasonality by the determination of a proper mean block length p−1. The optimal length will be determined by the extent of the dependence in the original time series (Bowers and Heaton, 2013). For close to iid data, p can be close to 1, while for strongly autocorrelated data, p should be closer to 0 for blocks to capture the serial dependence. Combining the stationary bootstrap approach and the calculation of DWP and EaR, in the following we outline the applied procedure for this study in more detail. In the ﬁrst step, instead of bootstrapping directly based on the half-hourly intraday price and dispatch data, a pre-calculation procedure is implemented. In particular, the electricity market is marked by its signiﬁcant periodicity within a day, i.e. high 178 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia demand during working hours and low demand in the morning and at night (Weron, 2006). Reconstructing the simulated data series with subsamples which contain less- than-1-day observations has the risk of destroying the intraday periodicity. In addition, the dispatched load of a station and the regional prices generally have a certain level of correlation and the correlation is diﬀerent for diﬀerent stations, which will be discussed in Section 4.5.3. Therefore, to ensure that the intraday patterns in electricity data are captured (i.e. subsamples always contain entire days) and the price-dispatch depen- dence is preserved, daily earnings (Es D = 48∑ t=1 Es t ) for each station s are pre-calculated and used in the bootstrap procedure. For the DWP simulation, daily earnings (Es D) and daily total dispatch (Q s D = 48∑ t=1 Q s t ) which are the numerator and denominator of Eq. (4.1) respectively, are calculated and the bootstrap is then implemented in a pairwise fashion. In the second step, the stationary bootstrap procedure is applied to the pre-calculated daily earnings and the daily earnings-dispatch pairs, with the mean block length de- termined through an automatic procedure proposed by Politis and White (2004) with the correction suggested in Patton et al. (2009). Note that in the pairwise bootstrap for DWP, the automatic block selection procedure is applied to both series of the pair and the maximum of the two selections is used in order to capture the dependence in both series. Note, however that stationary bootstrapping is less sensitive to the se- lection of block length compared to its alternatives such as circular bootstrap (Politis and Romano, 1994; Radovanov and Marcikić, 2014). Generally, any period of interest with length M can be generated by the proposed bootstrap approach. In this study we decided to focus both on a yearly period as well as on quarterly periods. However, to illustrate the procedure in the following let M equal one year, i.e. 365 days of electricity trading and possible dispatch for the considered generators. Yearly DWPs ( M∑ D=1 Es D M∑ D=1 Qs D×0.5) and earnings ( M∑ D=1 Es D) are thus calculated. In the third step, for each station s, the second step is repeated 10,000 times and an empirical distribution based on 10,000 outcomes can be constructed for both yearly 179 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia earnings and DWPs. The bootstrapped distributions then allow us to examine various distributional properties of DWPs, earnings, in particular the EaRs as well as the upside potentials of earnings for each station can be measured through Eqs. (4.4) and (4.5). Finally, the distributional properties for each generation technology can be obtained by calculating the mean across all stations relying on this generation technology. 4.5 The data and preliminary analysis 4.5.1 The data This study analyses DWPs and earnings for power stations of diﬀerent generation technologies in two regional markets in the Australian NEM: NSW which is dominated by coal-ﬁred generation, and SA which is a market dominated by generation from wind and natural gas. In total, 74 stations (38 from NSW and 36 from SA) which are in operation as of December 2019 and participate in the NEM’s central dispatch process are considered. The Australian NEM has experienced a series of changes in recent years, including the exit of large scale fossil fuel-ﬁred power stations and entry of renewable plants especially during the period from 2014 to 2017 (Rai and Nelson, 2020a). These developments have had signiﬁcant impact on market prices and supply conditions. To avoid substantial in-sample structural changes and ensure the relevance of this analysis, a recent sample period from January 2017 to December 2019 is used. In particular, we use half-hourly spot price and station load data for the two considered regional markets obtained from AEMO28. For the bootstrap analysis, daily earnings and outputs for each station are subsequently calculated according to the procedure outlined in Section 4.4.3. Table 4.2 reports the descriptive statistics for half-hourly spot prices and loads of the typical stations29 of diﬀerent generation technologies in NSW and SA. Regional 28 See https://www.aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem 29 For each generation type, the median capacity station is selected as the typical station except that 180 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia electricity prices in both markets exhibit skewness and excess kurtosis. With mean and median prices around or below A$100/MWh, the maximum prices in both markets can be as extreme as equal to or above A$14000/MWh. On the other hand, negative minimum prices caused by excess supply during low demand periods can be observed, especially for SA that is characterized by high penetration of VREs. In addition, wholesale spot electricity prices are on average higher in SA than in NSW. Furthermore, the standard deviation of prices for both markets show that SA prices are more than twice as volatile as prices in NSW. In terms of the station loads for the two regional markets, while black coal, wind and solar stations have loads closer to normal, the load of typical peak load stations such as hydro, natural gas, kerosene, diesel oil and battery stations are all right-skewed and leptokurtic. Since diﬀerent stations have varying capacities, signiﬁcant diﬀerence exists in the means and standard deviations of station loads. To make the variation of station loads comparable, the coeﬃcient of variation (CV) is calculated, which suggests the highest variability in the load of kerosene and diesel oil and the lowest variability in the load of black coal, wind and solar stations. Noticeably, in both regional markets, the minimum load as well as the median load are equal or close to zero for peak load stations (hydro, natural gas, kerosene, diesel oil and battery). As expected also solar generation plants have a considerable number of occasions with zero generations, i.e. when these stations are not dispatched. Note that conducted ADF tests suggest that all considered data series are stationary30. HORNSDPR, which is the largest battery storage, is selected for data suﬃciency. The three stations with battery storage all started later than the start of our sample period, while HORNSDPR has the most available data, see Table 4.E.1 in Appendix. 30 The series of daily earnings and loads for each station which are used in the applied bootstrap proce- dure are also stationary. The results can be found in Tables 4.D.1 and 4.D.2 in the Appendix. 181 Chapter 4.

It illustrates the source of earnings for each generation technology. According to the earnings pattern in the plots, three groups of generation technologies are identiﬁed: the ﬁrst group contains black coal which is a major base load generation technology, and VRE generators including wind and solar which have close to zero operating cost but are intermittent in nature. A feature of this group of technologies is a considerable share of earnings from each price range, which indicates that these technologies gen- erate similar amounts of electricity under diﬀerent scenarios. Note that in general the share of earnings from the lowest price quintile is much lower than the share of earn- ings from the highest price quintile due to the lower price paid for the same amount of output. Hydro and natural gas power form the second group. Over half of the earnings for this group of generators are from the highest price quintiles, while a smaller share of earnings from the lower price quintiles (around 20% of earnings from the second highest price quintile and another 20% from the three lowest price quintiles) is also observed. The third group are technologies including kerosene in NSW and diesel oil and battery storage in SA which are fast-responsive and usually serve only as peak 182 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia load or reserve power generators which only generate on extreme occasions. As shown in the plots, the earnings for these technologies are mainly generated during high price scenarios. Speciﬁcally, almost all earnings of diesel oil, over 95% of earnings of kerosene and over 80% of earnings of battery storage come from the highest price quintile. A: Price/earnings stack comparison in NSW B: Price/earnings stack comparison in SA Fig. 4.4: Source of earnings (i.e. earnings obtained under diﬀerent price ranges) for diﬀerent generation technologies. Quintile 5 is the highest price range (i.e. 80th - 100th percentile of prices) and Quintile 1 is the lowest price range (i.e. 0th - 20th percentile of prices). 183 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia 4.5.3 Correlation between station load and prices For a better understanding of the load pattern of diﬀerent generation technologies relative to the operating conditions of the market, correlations between the dispatched load of each station and regional prices are calculated and plotted in Fig. 4.5. In particular, the output from black coal-ﬁred stations in NSW is relatively constant with only a limited level of variation and a low impact of price changes. Therefore, for these base load generators we observe a very low correlation between the dispatched load and spot electricity prices. Wind and solar stations generally have zero or negative correlation with the prices, due to the non-controllable and intermittent nature of VRE generations. Furthermore, the low correlation between wind output and the prices together with the high correlation between the loads of diﬀerent wind stations (see Fig. 4.B.1 in the Appendix) illustrates that a high aggregate supply from wind power stations tends to reduce overall price levels. This phenomenon is termed the ‘wind correlation penalty’ in MacGill (2010), Hirth (2013) and Rai and Nunn (2020). A similar phenomenon is also observed for solar generation. Hydro, natural gas, battery, kerosene and diesel oil stations typically have higher correlations with price levels, since they respond faster to price changes and can increase their output in high price scenarios. Interestingly, even for peak load generators which increase output when prices are high and frequently act as the price setter, the correlations are all below 0.5. A reason for this observation is that peak load generators typically only start generating when the price reaches a certain level, which leads to non-linearity in the relationship and reduces the measured correlation between the load and prices. In addition, note that the usage of each station is also subject to the owner ﬁrm’s business decision and factors including the age and operating costs of the station as well as networks and capacity constraints. Therefore, generation from individual stations using the same technology can exhibit diﬀerent levels of correlations with spot prices. 184 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia Fig. 4.5: Correlations between each station generation and regional spot prices. Authors’ calculation based on data obtained from AEMO for the period between January 2017 and December 2019. 185 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia 4.6 Empirical analysis 4.6.1 Analysis of DWPs In this section, as introduced in Section 4.4.1, DWP as a proﬁtability measure is calcu- lated for each station in NSW and SA based on the three-year sample between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019. Results for the conducted analysis are illustrated in Fig. 4.6. As shown in Panel A of Fig. 4.6, in NSW, the DWP is stable across black coal stations at around A$90 per MWh which is close to the mean regional price. DWPs of wind stations are slightly lower than those of black coal stations, while DWPs of solar stations are on average even lower with a A$51/MWh minimum. The low DWPs of VRE generations are consistent with the low correlation between the load of wind and solar stations and spot prices found in Section 4.5.3. In comparison, the DWPs of the diﬀerent hydro stations in NSW have a higher variation with a range of average DWPs from A$90/MWh to A$200/MWh. An even higher variation of DWPs can be observed for natural gas stations, where DWPs range from A$100/MWh up to A$300/MWh. Note that for each of these stations DWPs are all well above the mean regional price in NSW. The only kerosene-ﬁred station in NSW is achieving the highest DWP at over A$350/MWh. Due to its expensive cost, kerosene stations typically only generate in peak hours with high spot prices. In SA (Fig. 4.6, Panel B), the price variation across diﬀerent technologies is much larger than for NSW. While the DWP is around A$75/MWh for wind generators, DWPs range from A$70/MWh to A$1200/MWh for natural gas generators and from A$1500/MWh to A$2500/MWh for diesel oil generators. While SA has a much higher mean regional price (A$101.38/MWh) than NSW (A$87.55/MWh), the DWPs of wind stations in SA (around A$75/MWh) are lower than those in NSW (above A$80/MWh). This is consistent with the cannibalisation eﬀect (Prol et al., 2020) that the higher penetration of wind generation in SA reduces its own market value. While utility scale solar generations only started in mid-2018 in SA, our ﬁndings suggest that DWPs of the three 186 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia solar stations in SA are typically higher than those of wind stations. Battery storages in SA have higher DWPs ranging from A$138/MWh to A$322/MWh, since these stations are fast to respond to higher spot prices and thus are typically dispatched when prices are high and charge their battery when prices are low. However, compared to other peak load generators in SA, i.e. natural gas and diesel oil, DWPs of battery storage are much lower. As discussed by Denholm et al. (2019), battery is becoming increasingly more competitive for peaking purposes than traditional conventional technologies like natural gas because of lower costs. Notably, DWPs vary signiﬁcantly for diﬀerent natural gas stations, mainly due to the diﬀerent technologies used by these stations. In particular, OCGT stations such as AGLHAL and DRYCGT in SA typically get higher average prices, since they are more suitable for peak occasions, while CCGT stations such as NPPPPS and OSBORNE have both peak load and base load capacity and therefore also generate in low price scenarios. 187 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia A: DWPs for stations in NSW. B: DWPs for stations in SA. Natural Gas and Diesel Oil stations are plotted in separate axes because of their much broader DWP range compared to the other generation technologies. Fig. 4.6: DWPs for the period between January 2017 and December 2019 for each power station. 188 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia 4.6.2 Analysis of earnings Apart from the DWPs examined in Section 4.6.1, earnings of stations using diﬀerent generation technologies are assessed in this section. Hereby, we focus in particular on variations in earnings for each power station. To do this, the earnings of each station in NSW and SA are estimated with a rolling 3-month window and Figs. 4.7 and 4.8 plot the estimated earnings for the typical station of each generation technology. To account for the diﬀerent mean output level of each station and to make the variation of earnings comparable, estimated earnings for each station are normalised by dividing the generated three-month earnings at each point in time by the mean of all three-month earning periods. As shown in Fig. 4.7, the normalised earnings generated from black coal stations are relatively stable. Wind and solar earnings are slightly more volatile within a wider range but both vary smoothly. In comparison, earnings of peak load generators such as hydro and natural gas stations in NSW both exhibit higher volatility and some seasonality. Relatively higher earnings tend to appear in Q1 and Q3 in a calendar year. Kerosene generations have the most volatile earnings in which both zero earnings and signiﬁcant jumps are observed. In particular, earnings of kerosene stations are typically zero until short periods of high earnings— the result of the power station being dispatched during an extreme spot price scenario—occur. The increased earnings after such a scenario typically stay ﬂat and drop back close to zero, once the extreme price dispatch scenario is not part of the rolling window anymore. This pattern in the earnings is because the kerosene station does not typically generate and only gets dispatched in extreme price occasions which are intrinsically rare. It reﬂects a risk of investment in this type of plant, since there is a reasonably high chance of making no proﬁt for an extended period of time for these power stations. In SA (Fig. 4.8), the least variation in earnings can be observed for wind power stations. The earnings of peak load stations generating electricity from diesel oil, battery and natural gas as shown in the ﬁgure exhibit a similar pattern to those of the kerosene 189 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia station in NSW, while battery earnings vary in a smaller range compared to the earnings of other peak load technologies. Notably, for the solar station in SA, while earnings are typically stable and stay at a relatively low level, high earning were observed in Q1 2019 due to a period of solar generation coinciding with an extreme price scenario in SA. As noted by Riesz et al. (2011), while extreme price outcomes are important to the revenue of all generators, they are especially signiﬁcant for solar generators. In summary, Sections 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 illustrate signiﬁcant diﬀerences in DWPs and earnings for diﬀerent generation technologies. Furthermore, the earnings of each tech- nology, especially for peak load generators, vary substantially in diﬀerent time period and price scenarios, yielding signiﬁcant uncertainty and risk for market participants. Therefore, understanding the diﬀerent risk proﬁles of diﬀerent generation technologies is important and is addressed in Section 4.6.3. 190 Chapter 4.

Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia 4.6.3 Simulation results This section assesses the proﬁtability of diﬀerent generation technologies in the regional markets of NSW and SA from a risk management perspective by simulating DWPs and earnings, and examining their distributional properties. 4.6.3.1 Simulated DWPs In a ﬁrst step, applying the stationary bootstrap procedure described in Section 4.4.3, we simulate one-year DWPs for each station. Plots for the distribution of DWPs for typical stations of diﬀerent generation technologies are shown in Figs. 4.9 and 4.10. These can be interpreted as providing information on the expected DWP of a generator as well as on the uncertainty related to the DWP. As can be observed in Fig. 4.9 for NSW, the simulated DWPs for the generation tech- nologies have very diﬀerent distributions. While the typical price range is A$70/MWh to A$110/MWh for black coal, wind and solar stations, A$100/MWh to A$250/MWh for hydro and natural gas stations, DWPs of kerosene generations vary from close to A$0/MWh to A$1500/MWh. In addition, while the DWP distribution of the black coal station is close to normal, the distribution of other stations, especially peak load stations, are all highly right-skewed and leptokurtotic. The shape of these distribu- tions is driven by the fact that peak load stations mainly operate under price spikes or extreme price scenarios. Among all stations in SA plotted in Fig. 4.10, DWPs of wind generators have the lowest price range and the distribution is slightly left-skewed. DWPs of the solar station are slightly skewed to the right with a longer upper tail in comparison to the DWP distribution of wind generators. The DWP distributions of other station types are all right skewed, with DWPs mostly varying signiﬁcantly above the mean regional price level. However, the DWP range of the battery storage is much lower than that of natural gas and diesel oil stations. 193 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia Figs. 4.9 and 4.10 clearly show that distributions of simulated DWPs vary signiﬁcantly for diﬀerent generation technologies. Tables 4.3 and 4.4 provide more details of the distributional properties for each generation technology, while in the following we also discuss the causes and implications of these diﬀerences. 194 Chapter 4.

Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia Tables 4.3 and 4.4 report distributional properties for DWPs of each generation tech- nology in NSW and SA. Speciﬁcally, for each station, a stationary bootstrap is applied and the descriptive statistics of the distribution such as the mean, standard devia- tion and diﬀerent quantiles of the simulated DWPs are calculated. In a next step, the stations are grouped according to the technologies they use and the distributional properties for each generation technology are reported for NSW and SA.31 Note that for natural gas stations, results for OCGTs and CCGTs are also shown so that their diﬀerence can be compared. In Panel (a) of Table 4.3 for simulated one-year DWPs, black coal stations, as the base load generators in NSW, have a mean DWP close to the mean regional spot price (A$87.55/MWh). The distribution of simulated DWPs also exhibits low variation. With a relatively small dispersion level as measured by the coeﬃcient of variation and quartile coeﬃcient of dispersion, the 1%, 5%, 95% and 99% quantiles show that black coal stations in NSW typically obtain a stable 1-year DWP varying between A$78/MWh and A$107/MWh. The mean DWPs of stations based on VREs, i.e. wind and solar, are both lower than that of black coal stations. Compared to DWPs of wind stations, the simulated DWPs of solar stations are more uncertain and exhibit higher dispersion, reﬂected by lower 1% and 5% quantiles and higher 95% and 99% quantiles. Among the intermediate to peak load technologies in NSW, stations using kerosene get the highest mean and volatility of simulated DWPs, followed by natural gas stations using OCGT technology. The distributional properties of simulated 1-year DWPs of hydro stations and natural gas stations with CCGT are similar, with a mean and coeﬃcient of variation lower than for the DWP of OCGT and kerosene generators. In Panel (b) - (e) of Table 4.3, quarterly DWPs in diﬀerent seasons are simulated separately and seasonal patterns can be observed. In particular, simulated DWPs of all stations are on average higher and more volatile in summer due to higher regional prices 31 Note that stations which started to operate later than January 2019 are excluded from the simulation procedure due to a lack of available data. In addition, considering the strong seasonality in electricity market data, to ensure that price and dispatch observations from diﬀerent seasons get equal weight in the bootstrap procedure, the sample data for stations with less than a three-year operation period are truncated. Overall, for each station, observations for a year are only used in the bootstrap procedure, if dispatch data is available for the entire calendar year. 197 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia and demand, and are on average lower and less volatile in other seasons. While the distributional properties for DWPs of black coal and wind stations are relatively stable, the properties of peak load stations, especially the kerosene station, vary signiﬁcantly across diﬀerent seasons. For VRE technologies, as expected the seasonal variation of DWPs is higher for solar stations in comparison to wind power generation. In addition, while the simulated 1-year DWPs of hydro and CCGT stations exhibit similar distributional properties, the quarterly DWPs of hydro stations tend to be higher and more volatile in summer and lower and less volatile in other seasons compared to those of CCGT stations. Regarding the simulated one-year DWPs for SA (Table 4.4, Panel (a)), the lowest and least volatile DWPs can be observed for wind power stations. Even the 99% quantile of the DWP distribution for wind stations is lower than the average regional price in SA. In comparison, simulated one-year DWPs of solar stations in SA are on average higher than the regional price and three times more volatile in comparison to wind generators. This can mainly be attributed to the signiﬁcantly higher DWPs of solar stations in summer as shown in Panel (b). Among dispatchable generators, the mean and volatility of simulated DWPs of diesel oil stations are signiﬁcantly higher than those of other stations. The mean and dispersion of DWPs for battery plants are signiﬁcantly lower in comparison to OCGT stations, but are higher than for CCGT stations. Similar to the seasonal patterns observed in DWPs for NSW, also in SA there is a signiﬁcant increase in the simulated DWPs in summer for each generation technology, see Panel (b) to (e) in Table 4.4. Again we ﬁnd that this increase is the least signiﬁcant for wind power stations. Overall, the main ﬁndings of this section can be summarised in three points. First, lower simulated DWPs for renewable technologies indicate their lower cost and cheaper electricity output compared to conventional fossil fuel generation technologies. The lower DWPs also indicate that VREs cannot optimise the time of dispatch, because the generation is intermittent. Speciﬁcally, wind and solar generation from VREs generally obtain DWPs that are similar or even lower than DWPs for black coal-ﬁred base load 198 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia power plants. This ﬁnding is consistent with the low operating costs of wind and solar and the cannibalisation eﬀect documented in Prol et al. (2020). Meanwhile, among generation technologies which are used for intermediate to peak purposes, DWPs of hydro generations are typically similar or lower than DWPs of CCGT generations and signiﬁcantly lower than DWPs of OCGT and kerosene generations. While battery storage, OCGT and diesel oil are all typically used under extreme price scenarios, DWPs are signiﬁcantly lower for battery storage than for the other two technologies. Second, during summer DWPs for solar stations are signiﬁcantly higher than for wind power stations. This result holds for both NSW and SA. Furthermore, one-year DWPs for solar stations are also higher than those of wind stations. This is consistent with the arguments of Joskow (2011) and Riesz et al. (2011) that solar generators should be able to achieve higher per MWh revenue than wind generators, since the operation times of solar stations are more likely to coincide with peak priced periods in the daytime, while summer peak hours are especially important to solar revenues. Third, under the current market price conditions in the NEM, the simulated mean annual DWP for black coal is higher than the projected levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of Graham et al. (2019) in the lowest cost scenario (A$83/MWh) but lower than the LCOE in the high cost scenario (A$112/MWh). This indicates a risk of black coal stations not being able to recover their costs. In combination with environmental concerns due to higher carbon emissions of coal-ﬁred power plants, these results also make it unlikely that there will be new entries of major coal-ﬁred power stations in the NEM in the future. The projected LCOEs of Graham et al. (2019) for gas generators are between A$137/MWh and A$203/MWh for peak load and between A$67/MWh and A$113/MWh for base to intermediate load. Since the two gas generation technologies, OCGT and CCGT, are typically used for peak load and base to intermediate load respectively, the simulated mean DWPs (A$213/MWh of OCGT and A$122/MWh of CCGT in NSW and A$542/MWh of OCGT and A$114/MWh of CCGT in SA) are signiﬁcantly higher than the corresponding LCOEs. This means gas generators in the considered markets are likely to recover their costs. 199 Chapter 4.

Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia 4.6.3.2 Earnings-at-Risk In this section, simulated earnings of each station in NSW and SA are examined and the risks of earnings are measured. Figs. 4.11 and 4.12 show the simulated one-year earnings for typical stations of diﬀerent generation technologies. We ﬁrst consider the results for NSW. In Fig. 4.11, the earnings of diﬀerent stations are distributed in very diﬀerent ranges, mainly driven by the capacity of each station. For example, as base load generator, black coal stations typically have the highest capacity and mean output level among all plotted stations, which also leads to the highest average earnings. We also ﬁnd that the kerosene station HUNTVGT has the lowest average earnings distri- bution due to its low generation capacity and frequent zero-dispatch occasions. At the same time, the station has the greatest variation in simulated earnings, indicating a high uncertainty for the operators of the power plant. This high level of uncertainty for the considered kerosene power station was also indicated by the substantial variation in DWPs in Fig. 4.9. The displayed earnings distributions also indicate that simulated earnings for the black coal, wind and solar stations are closer to being normally dis- tributed, the earnings distributions for peak load stations are signiﬁcantly skewed to the right. In comparison, for stations in SA in Fig. 4.12, the simulated earnings of the wind station are slightly left skewed and are similar to its simulated DWP distribution, while other stations all have right-skewed simulated earnings distributions. In Tables 4.5 and 4.6, the distributional properties of simulated earnings are presented. We also consider EaR as well as the upside potential of earnings for the operators of these power stations for each generation technology. Panel (a) of Table 4.5 describes the distribution of simulated one-year earnings. The dispersion as measured by the coeﬃcient of variation and quartile coeﬃcient of dispersion is the lowest for black coal and wind stations and slightly higher for solar stations. Regarding intermediate to peak load generation technologies, the earnings distribution dispersion of hydro sta- tions is lower than that of both types of natural gas stations and the kerosene station. The measured skewness and kurtosis for wind and solar are closer to those of a normal distribution, while the earnings distributions for kerosene and OCGT generators are 202 Chapter 4.

Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia extremely skewed to the right and leptokurtotic. EaRs (99% and 95%) measure the potential loss in the expected earnings 32. For example, the 99% EaR of black coal earnings of 15.69% means there is only a 1% probability that the earnings obtained by a black coal-ﬁred power station over the next year will be less than 84.31% of its expected earnings (i.e. 15.69% of expected earnings will be lost). In contrast, the 99% upside potential of black coal earnings of 24.71% means that there is a 1% probability that a black coal station will get more than 24.71% earnings in excess of its expected earnings over the next year. Compared to black coal stations, wind stations have both lower EaRs and lower upside earnings potentials, while the EaRs and upside poten- tials of solar stations are slightly higher. Both EaRs and upside earnings potentials are signiﬁcantly higher for intermediate load and peak load generators than for base load and VRE generators. The highest upside potential is observed for the kerosene station, where there is a 5% (or 1%) opportunity that the station can obtain earnings that are 150% (or 235%) above its expected one-year earnings. Meanwhile, the EaR of the kerosene station is also the highest, with a 5% (or 1%) chance that the station will lose 86.58% (or 93.9%) of its expected earnings over the next year. On the other hand, earnings of hydro stations have lower EaR and lower upside potential compared to ei- ther of the two technologies of gas generators. Overall, for each generation technology, the upside potential of earnings tends to be higher than the corresponding EaR, what can be attributed to the fact that spot electricity prices are typically asymmetric, lep- tokurtic and highly skewed to the right. Considering the quarterly earnings simulation reported in Panel (b) to (e) in Table 4.5, similar patterns are also observed in diﬀerent seasons, i.e. summer (Quarter 1), autumn (Quarter 2), winter (Quarter 3) and spring (Quarter 4). Meanwhile, EaRs and the upside potential of earnings both tend to be higher in summer. However, the EaR of the kerosene station is slightly higher in au- 32 Note that the expected earnings vary signiﬁcantly for diﬀerent stations and technologies. This is due to the substantial diﬀerence in capacities of diﬀerent stations. For example, the typical black coal station has a mean half-hourly load of 1272MW while the kerosene station has a mean load of 0.19MW (Table 4.2), which leads to the signiﬁcantly higher earnings of the black coal station. However, the av- erage price received by the black coal station and the kerosene station is A$88/MWh and A$357/MWh respectively (Fig. 4.6). Therefore, simulated mean earnings are not reported here. Instead, DWPs measured in a form of volume weighted earnings can be used to compare the proﬁtability of diﬀerent generation technologies, which were discussed in the previous section (Section 4.6.3.1). 205 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia tumn than in other seasons, which could be due to the nature of kerosene technology that is typically used for extreme price scenarios so there is a chance that signiﬁcantly lower or even no proﬁt at all is made in low demand periods like autumn. Results for the SA market are reported in Table 4.6. Our ﬁndings suggest that the 1-year earnings for wind generators have signiﬁcantly lower dispersion, EaR and upside potential than earnings of any other generation technology. Compared to wind power stations, solar generators exhibit higher dispersion in earnings. Interestingly, for solar power stations the 1-year EaR and upside potential also exceed those of CCGT gener- ations, mainly driven by the volatile earnings during summer (Panel (b)) and autumn (Panel (c)). Regarding peak load generation technologies, the highest EaRs and upside potential of earnings are observed for diesel oil stations. Both EaR and upside earn- ings potential of battery stations are lower than those of OCGT generators. Notably, CCGT generation has much lower EaRs and upside earnings potential in SA than in NSW. This could be attributed to the fact that it is more frequently used for base to intermediate load purposes in SA, since coal-ﬁred power stations that are typically used as base load generators have all been shut down in this region. Similar patterns with respect to earnings distributions of diﬀerent generation technologies are also observed for diﬀerent seasons of the year. Results for diﬀerent quarters are presented in Panel (b) to (e) of Table 4.6. EaRs and upside potential of earnings tend to be higher in summer for each technology. However, high upside potentials of peak load generations such as diesel oil, OCGT and battery generations can also be observed in other seasons due to high uncertainty in their output. It is also worth to note that the earnings dispersion of solar stations is substantially lower in winter and spring. In summary, the simulated upside potential of earnings are generally higher than EaRs for each generation technology, especially for peak load generators. This is mainly driven by the typically high skewness of spot electricity prices and the occurrence of price spikes. In addition, earnings obtained by peak load generation technologies tend to have signiﬁcantly higher upside potential than VRE and base load generators, but also have higher downside risk (i.e. EaRs) due to the reliance of peak load generators on 206 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia irregular price spikes or high price scenarios. Among peak load generators, renewable technologies such as hydro and battery storage tend to have lower upside potential of earnings but also lower EaRs, i.e. a higher level of certainty in their earnings. Furthermore, the mean capacity factor for each generation technology is estimated based on the simulated load of each station and reported in both Tables 4.5 and 4.6. According to the LCOE analysis of Australian Energy Regulator (2018a) on selected technologies in the NEM, a new black coal station in NSW with the capacity factor as shown in Table 4.5 or a new OCGT station in SA with the capacity factor as shown in Table 4.6 is ‘potentially able to recover costs in ideal conditions’. In contrast, a new wind station, a new solar station or a new CCGT station in SA with the capacity factor as shown in Table 4.6 is ‘likely to be able to recover costs’ 33. This shows a potential investment preference towards wind, solar and CCGT stations. 33 ‘Potentially able to recover costs in ideal conditions’ and ‘likely to be able to recover costs’ are used by Australian Energy Regulator (2018a) to describe the likelihood of cost recovery for a new entrant generator in the NEM at diﬀerent capacity factors. ‘Potentially able to recover costs in ideal conditions’ at a certain capacity factor indicates that the generator with this capacity factor is able to recover its cost only under a low cost scenario. ‘Likely to be able to recover costs’ at a certain capacity factor indicates that the generator with this capacity factor is able to recover its cost even even under a high cost scenario. 207 Chapter 4.

Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia 4.7 Conclusions This study conducts an empirical analysis of the earnings and risk proﬁles of diﬀerent generation technologies in the Australian NEM. Using a unique dataset that contains half-hourly data on the dispatched amount of electricity for each power plant, we assess DWPs, EaRs as well as the upside potential of earnings for diﬀerent generation technologies. Our study focuses on the regional market in NSW that is dominated by fossil fuel ﬁred generation as well as the market in SA that has a high share of renewable energy penetration. Our sample period covers the time horizon from January 2017 to December 2019 that contains several scenarios of extreme price behaviour and can be characterized as a transition period towards an increasing share of renewable energy generation. We ﬁnd that generators using hydro, natural gas, battery storage, kerosene or diesel oil achieve signiﬁcantly higher DWPs than coal ﬁred stations or intermittent generation from wind and solar. DWPs of generation from renewable energy are relatively low compared to conventional and dispatchable generation from fossil fuels. This result is true for all types of fossil fuel generators, i.e. generators that are predominantly used for base load, intermediate load or peak load purposes. On the one hand, this indicates the advantage of renewable energy generation in reducing market price volatility and electricity costs for customers. On the other hand, so-called cannibalisation eﬀects of wind and solar (Prol et al., 2020) are observed to the extent that with higher solar penetration in NSW, solar DWPs are lower in NSW than in SA, whereas wind DWPs are lower in SA, where wind penetration is higher. In addition, seasonal patterns exist and DWPs are typically higher in summer for all technologies. This pattern is relatively moderate for wind and coal stations compared to solar and typical peak load generators. We ﬁnd that generators with stronger correlation with spot prices such as hydro, natural gas, battery storage, kerosene and diesel oil stations have signiﬁcantly higher upside potential of earnings in comparison to generators using coal, wind or solar. At the same time, since these generators make a signiﬁcant share of their earnings 210 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia in extreme price periods, they also have much higher EaRs which indicate greater uncertainty in their proﬁts. The very diﬀerent earnings and risk proﬁles for various generation types have important implications both for new investment evaluation from an investor’s perspective and for successful planning and optimisation of the overall NEM generation mix from a regulator’s perspective. Speciﬁcally, coal ﬁred generators, although having low EaRs, achieve relatively low DWPs compared to other generation technologies. As a result, as suggested by Graham et al. (2019), in high fuel cost scenario their DWPs can be lower than their LCOE. This indicates a risk for coal generators of not covering their costs. Furthermore, additional cheaper renewable generators entering the market could further reduce electricity prices and the share and proﬁtability of coal-ﬁred generation. VRE generations based on wind and solar typically have low DWPs as well as a rather low upside potential of earnings. It reﬂects the cannibalisation eﬀect that increased penetration of wind and solar generation in the market may undermine their own value due to the decline of electricity prices. This emphasises the need to combine wind or solar generations with other dispatchable renewable energy or storage facilities to improve the overall proﬁtability. Since the cannibalisation eﬀect is largely caused by the intermittent and inﬂexible nature of VRE generation (Prol et al., 2020), increasing ﬂexibility by introducing dispatchable and ﬂexible generators to the portfolio such as hydro and battery storage will mitigate the value drop of wind and solar (Hirth, 2016; Lovegrove et al., 2018). Meanwhile, compared to wind generators, generation from solar power plants tends to have higher variation in their earnings and achieve higher overall DWPs. On the one hand, this is consistent with Riesz et al. (2011) that solar farms tend to obtain higher MWh value and thus higher contract prices for power purchase agreements than wind farms. On the other hand, according to Prasad et al. (2017), there is also an opportunity for the combination of wind and solar generations to create synergy, mitigate the cannibalisation eﬀect and achieve overall higher market value. Natural gas generators, especially OCGT plants, are still the dominant generators 211 Chapter 4. Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia for peak load purposes in the NEM, while advancements in CCGT technologies in recent years (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019a) has signiﬁcantly increased the eﬃciency of gas ﬁred plants to also generate electricity for base and intermediate load. This signiﬁcantly increases the capacity factor of CCGT stations in SA and reduces the risks involved in CCGT investments. Furthermore, more expensive peak load technologies such generation from kerosene and diesel oil are used in the NEM for extreme scenarios with much lower capacity factors, signiﬁcantly higher DWPs and upside earnings potential and substantial variation in proﬁts. On the other hand, despite the relatively low current capacity in the considered markets, battery and hydro technologies show great potential to ﬁrm and secure the market supply and reduce extreme outcomes and volatility. This is true in particular for pumped hydro power plants which allow limited water reserves to be reused at relatively low cost, while supplying fast responsive and dispatchable generation of electricity. Overall, these developments suggest a further increasing penetration of VREs in the NEM in the long run that can be expected to achieve its full potential once being combined with eﬃcient storage technologies. 212 References References Abad, P., Benito, S., López, C., 2014.

The extreme volatility in power markets as well as the current transition from largely fossil fuel-ﬁred power generation to a higher share of renewable energy sources poses signif- icant challenges for market participants and regulators. The thesis explores various risk factors, including volatility spillovers, extremal dependence in spot prices and the investment risk and proﬁtability of diﬀerent types of generation technologies, through three related studies. This chapter summarises the main ﬁndings of each study, elu- cidates the contributions of the thesis to the overall discipline and discusses future research directions. 5.1 Main ﬁndings Chapter 2 titled ‘Volatility Spillovers in Australian Electricity Markets’ examines volatil- ity spillover eﬀects across interconnected regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), which contains ﬁve state-based regional markets, namely, New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD), SA (South Australia), Tasmania (TAS) and Vic- toria (VIC). We apply various spillover indices originally proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012). We provide empirical evidence on the diﬀerent aspects of volatil- ity spillover eﬀects, including their magnitude, direction and time variations, as well as on the extent to which changing market conditions aﬀect spillovers by analysing data from January 2010 to December 2017. 227 Chapter 5. Conclusion We ﬁnd that although a signiﬁcant proportion of the system-wide volatility in the NEM is due to spillover eﬀects, the degree is lower compared to results reported for other ﬁnancial markets (e.g. Diebold and Yilmaz 2009, 2014; Zhang and Wang 2014). These results indicate that although spillover eﬀects across diﬀerent markets play an impor- tant role, regional price volatility is mostly inﬂuenced by local factors. The degree of spillover is time-varying and aﬀected both by short-term events, such as temporary generation or network outage, and long-term events, such as a change in the renewable energy share, the fuel mix, generation capacity and market policies. We also ﬁnd sig- niﬁcantly diﬀerent proﬁles of volatility spillover eﬀects between diﬀerent regions. The interregional transmission of price volatility is largely inﬂuenced by regional proximity and interconnection infrastructure. Further, we ﬁnd that VIC, which has the highest interconnection level and relatively low regional costs of electricity generation, is the most inﬂuential market in the NEM as the only constant net spillover transmitter. The net direction and magnitude of interregional spillover eﬀects are also time-varying and event-dependent. Finally, our results are robust when we use diﬀerent sub-periods of the sample. Additional robustness checks conﬁrm that our results also hold for diﬀerent choices of model speciﬁcation. Chapter 3 is titled ‘Extremal Dependence in Australian Electricity Markets’. It ex- tends the analysis presented in Chapter 2 and focuses on the dependence between extreme price outcomes. This is of interest to market participants who care only about prices above certain thresholds and thus are willing to eliminate the eﬀects of general volatilities where price ﬂuctuation is only mild. For example, the analysis focusing on events when prices are above AU$300 is important for retailers in the NEM who use derivatives such as ‘300 Cap Futures’ as a hedging tool to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of their risk management strategy. Using a sample period from July 2009 to June 2018 and half-hourly as well as 5-minute price observations, we apply the extremogram as a relatively new econometric framework originally proposed by Davis and Mikosch (2009) and Davis et al. (2011, 2012). In particular, we analyse in detail the patterns of serial dependence and persistence in extreme prices within each regional market and the transmission of extreme prices between regions in the NEM. 228 Chapter 5. Conclusion We ﬁnd signiﬁcant persistense for extreme spot electricity prices in each regional mar- ket. Speciﬁcally, there is a high likelihood in the NEM to observe price spikes in the same region at approximately the same time on several consecutive days. Meanwhile, the persistence of extreme prices tends to be stronger in markets with a higher share of VRE generation and also in more concentrated markets. The former could be a result of high price volatility caused by uncertainties in local supply, while the latter might be due to the exhibition of market power in highly concentrated markets. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant transmission eﬀects of extreme price outcomes across regional mar- kets. The transmission of extreme price spikes is also more pronounced between adjoin- ing and physically interconnected markets what is consistent with results for volatility spillover eﬀects studied in Chapter 2. Furthermore, the transmission eﬀect between each pair of markets is not symmetric and is dependent on the relative importance of the diﬀerent markets. Among all regions, the extreme price transmission from VIC to SA is the strongest. We attribute this ﬁnding to the fact that SA is highly reliant on electricity imports from VIC to ﬁrm its supply, because of the large share of wind generation in SA and the resulting uncertainty due to its intermittent nature. Compared to the ﬁndings of Chapter 2 regarding total volatility spillovers, additional patterns in intra- and inter-regional price transmission eﬀects are worth noting when the focus is put on extreme events only. Firstly, while relatively strong volatility spillovers are observed between the directly interconnected market pairs NSW-VIC and TAS-VIC in both directions, signiﬁcant extremal dependence is only observed from VIC to NSW. This ﬁnding indicates the diﬀerent transmission structure in the NEM in terms of mild price variations and extreme price events. In particular, NSW tends to transmit general price volatility rather than extreme prices to VIC. Similarly, while the connectedness between TAS and VIC is strong in terms of volatility transmission, extreme prices in one region do not tend to cause spikes in the other region. These patterns potentially reﬂect the ability of VIC and TAS to absorb and mitigate the eﬀects of extreme price transmission, since VIC has the highest interconnection level to the rest of the NEM, and a high capacity of local hydro power generation in TAS provides high ﬂexibility to 229 Chapter 5. Conclusion respond to demand or price shocks. Secondly, Chapter 3 examines the persistence of extreme price events which were not analysed in Chapter 2. The persistence patterns are important, especially for peak load generators such as gas ﬁred plants and demand response facilities such as battery storage and large industrial customers with load curtailment arrangements. The op- eration of these market participants in terms of starting/stopping their facilities are highly dependent on potential re-occurrence or persistence of extreme price events. Chapter 4, titled ‘Average Dispatch Prices and Earnings-at-Risk for Generators in Australia’, examines the proﬁtability and investment risk of diﬀerent generation tech- nologies in the NEM. We use a unique dataset from January 2017 to December 2019, which contains spot electricity prices and the output from all power plants for the mar- kets in NSW and SA. We choose to examine these two markets, becasue NSW is still dominated by fossil fuel generation, while SA has a signiﬁcant penetration from VRE. We assess dispatch-weighted prices (DWP), earnings-at-risk (EaR) as well as upside earnings potential for various generation technologies. By examining the DWPs of diﬀerent power plants, we ﬁnd that dispatchable and ﬂexible generators, using hydro, natural gas, battery storage, kerosene or diesel oil, achieve signiﬁcantly higher DWPs than coal ﬁred generators, which are dispatchable but have relatively low ﬂexibility. Dispatchable and ﬂexible generators also have much higher DWPs than VRE generators without dispatchability, such as wind and solar farms. Furthermore, through a simulation study with a stationary bootstrap algorithm, we ﬁnd that dispatchable and ﬂexible generators typically have higher earnings potential than coal ﬁred generators and VRE generators. However, their EaR are also signiﬁcantly higher than those of generators relying on coal or VRE, which indicates a greater uncertainty in their earnings and the potential of exposure to higher losses. In addition, we ﬁnd seasonal patterns in the estimated earnings and the risk proﬁles of diﬀerent generation technologies. Higher uncertainty and dispersion of earnings are typically observed in summer when prices are most volatile. 230 Chapter 5. Conclusion 5.2 Contributions to the discipline This thesis contributes to several diﬀerent research areas related to risk management in electricity markets. Literature on extreme prices, spillovers and contagion eﬀects We identify diﬀerent factors that inﬂuence extreme prices and spillover eﬀects, including the generation mix of each market in an interconnected system, local market structure and capacity for market interconnection. In particular, Chapters 2 and 3 both discuss the potential underinvestment in interconnectors in the NEM, which could contribute to the occurrence of extreme outcomes. Without suﬃcient interconnector capacity, a lack of supply from interregional trade can lead to increased market power issues, unnecessarily high local prices and periods of high volatility. Moreover, spot prices and price volatility in a regional market will be more signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by local factors, and hence, spillover eﬀects will be lower than in a system with substantial interconnection capacity. In addition, as discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, the net transmission direction (i.e. whether a market is a net transmitter or receiver) of price spikes and volatility is determined by the relative importance of a market, in comparison to its counterpart in a bivariate setting, or in relation to all remaining markets when considering the entire system. The relative importance of markets is determined to a large extent by the local generation mix, the generation capacity, market concentration level and the degree to which a market is connected to the rest of the system. Thus, our ﬁndings contribute to the literature on extreme prices, spillovers and con- tagion eﬀects in electricity markets. Our study also provides indications for market participants on interregional trading, demand response strategies and hedging extreme prices, either within one market or across diﬀerent markets. By examining the eﬀects of a relevant policy change in Chapter 3, the thesis further provides insights for regulators on the impacts of policies on market volatility and extreme price outcomes. 231 Chapter 5. Conclusion Literature on market integration and interdependence The thesis also contributes to the literature on market integration and interdependence. Chapter 2 documents a relatively low level of integration for the NEM, indicated by the system-wide degree of spillover eﬀects. Despite the interconnection facilities available in the NEM, the level of system-wide volatility spillover is low in comparison to results reported in the literature for other ﬁnancial markets. This could be related to the speciﬁc features of electricity markets, including physical transmission of energy, ex- tremely high price caps in the market, a diﬀerent local generation mix in each regional market, the transition of the market to a higher share of renewable energy generation, and the limited capacity of interconnectors. In particular, both Chapters 2 and 3 ﬁnd quite diﬀerent price and volatility transmis- sion proﬁles between diﬀerent regions and stress the importance of interconnection to facilitate price alignment across regions as well as overall market integration. Further, we investigate the impact of the carbon pricing mechanism (CPM) on the NEM in- tegration level. We ﬁnd that the CPM slowed down the market integration process, as represented by volatility spillovers, potentially because the CPM caused changes in the generation mix, and its removal was coupled with a rise in overall spillovers in the NEM. The inﬂuence of the CPM is more pronounced for base load generators whose production typically causes higher carbon emissions. Overall, the ﬁndings of this thesis are also of importance for electricity market regula- tors who aim to evaluate existing market interconnections, the potential to achieve an integrated system and the eﬀects of encouraging more renewable generation. Literature on energy transition, renewable energy and carbon emission poli- cies The current worldwide transition towards renewable energy has caused substantial uncertainties and various challenges to relevant stakeholders, such as increased prices and price volatility in the NEM in recent years. This thesis sheds some light on the risks and opportunities presented by diﬀerent generation technologies in this changing 232 Chapter 5. Conclusion environment. Speciﬁcally, Chapter 4 ﬁnds that regardless of whether they are used for base load, in- termediate load or peak load purposes, renewable energy generators receive relatively low DWPs compared with their fossil fuel counterparts. This ﬁnding reﬂects the ‘dis- patchability premium’ that Rai and Nunn (2020) revealed, which refers to the higher market value obtained by being controllable and ﬂexible. It also indicates the lower generation costs of renewable power and the opportunity for regulators to reduce the price volatility and the overall electricity costs by incorporating more renewable re- sources. In addition, relatively low solar DWPs are observed in NSW, where a high market penetration from solar generation is prevalent, while relatively low wind DWPs are observed in SA, where the degree of generation from wind power is substantial. This is consistent with the so-called cannibalisation eﬀect of renewable energy doc- umented in Prol et al. (2020) and is partially due to a lack of ﬂexibility of VREs. This eﬀect indicates an opportunity and the need for VRE investors to incorporate dispatchable generation assets, and in particular, dispatchable renewable power plants, such as hydro and battery storage, in their portfolio to mitigate the value drop of VRE generation. Further, regarding the eﬀects of carbon emission policies, Chapter 2 documents various eﬀects of the CPM on the NEM. Apart from its impact on spillover eﬀects as discussed above, during the period when the CPM was in place, it changed the generation mix in the market and the interregional trade ﬂow; prices during that period are generally higher but less volatile in all regions. Therefore, the ﬁndings of this thesis provide insights on various investment risks as well as opportunities for diﬀerent types of generators. Insights are also provided on energy portfolio management from both a ﬁrm’s perspective with regard to managing earnings, and from a regulator’s perspective in terms of improving the stability and the reliability of electricity supply, while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions. Literature on multivariate econometric models in electricity markets 233 Chapter 5. Conclusion Finally, this thesis also contributes to the literature on multivariate econometric mod- els for electricity markets. Since the 1990s, a rapidly growing body of literature has applied various econometric models to study deregulated markets. However, only over the past decade have studies started to focus more on the interrelationship between diﬀerent electricity markets. Further, thus far, only a limited number of studies have focused on extreme events in spot electricity markets. Chapters 2 and 3 applied two relatively new econometric frameworks with limited application in the context of elec- tricity spot prices. They are both ﬂexible tools to quantify various transmission eﬀects of market price risk (i.e. extreme prices and high volatility periods). Applying the two diﬀerent models together with various robustness examinations, consistent ﬁndings are documented, which reﬂects the eﬀectiveness of these models in capturing patterns and dynamics of risk transmission in electricity markets. 5.3 Directions for future research The conducted analysis and the ﬁndings of this thesis also point towards several po- tential directions for future research. Impacts of available interconnector capacity As documented by Clements et al. (2015) and Nepal and Foster (2016), not only the existence of interconnectors between adjacent regions, but also the available capac- ity of these interconnectors plays an essential role for spillover eﬀects and extremal dependence. Nepal and Foster (2016) ﬁnd that interconnector constraints lead to inef- ﬁcient electricity trade ﬂow and potentially signiﬁcant price diﬀerences. Clements et al. (2015) suggest to use excess capacity of interconnectors as an explanatory variable for the size of price spikes in the NEM. When spare interconnector capacity reaches zero, electricity cannot be imported from neighbouring regions to oﬀset the local price or demand shocks and mitigate price spikes, and the degree of spillover eﬀects could also be decreased. Therefore, examining the impacts of spare interconnector capacity on the 234 Chapter 5. Conclusion dependence between regional prices and volatility transmission across markets will be an important future extension to the current study. The standard vector autoregressive model in Chapter 2 could be extended to incorporate spare capacity of interconnec- tors as an exogenous variable so that the estimated spillover eﬀects will be a function of available transmission capacity between regional markets 34. In addition, estimating the relationship between available interconnector capacity and the transmission of price and volatility shocks via alternative models are of interests. The relationship could be further examined over time, for diﬀerent regions with varying interconnection struc- ture and generation mix, and under diﬀerent price scenarios (e.g. peak and oﬀ-peak periods). Price spillover analysis While volatility spillover eﬀects and extremal price dependence are examined in this thesis, as pointed out by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) and Worthington et al. (2005), diﬀerent information can be obtained by examining the spillover eﬀects in the overall prices series. For example, Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) found that return spillovers display a gently upward trend, which is attributed to the increasing level of integra- tion for global ﬁnancial markets. In comparison, volatility spillovers are eventful, with bursts during crisis episodes, but display no trends. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to extend the spillover analysis to electricity prices. To account for the substantially higher non-linearity of electricity prices in comparison to price volatility, nonlinear models, such as regime-switching models (Higgs and Worthington, 2008; Janczura and Weron, 2010; Lindström and Regland, 2012; Eichler and Türk, 2013) and copula mod- els (Aderounmu and Wolﬀ, 2014a,b; Smith, 2015; Ignatieva and Trück, 2016), can be applied in combination with the framework of Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012). Also, alternative forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) methods, e.g., the new gen- eralised FEVD (GFEVD) method recently developed by Lanne and Nyberg (2016) could be applied. As suggested by the authors, these models are more easily inter- pretable for nonlinear models in comparison to the GFEVD proposed by Diebold and 34 We thank one of the examiners of the thesis for this suggestion. 235 Chapter 5. Conclusion Yilmaz (2012). Alternative simulation approaches for Earnings-at-Risk Chapter 4 applies a bootstrap approach based on historical data which has the advan- tage of not requiring particular assumptions on the distribution of variables and the ability to capture the stationarity, dependence and various other non-normal features of the original data series. The approach is well suited for the purpose of Chapter 4 that examines various risks under the current market conditions, which are expected to continue in the near future. As a future research extension, the application of a para- metric model in combination with Monte Carlo simulation can be of interest, since it will allow various risk assumptions to be made, such as those regarding potential future carbon policies, the share of renewable energy and the availability of VRE resources. In addition, as discussed in Chapter 3, strategic behaviour through generators’ bidding and rebidding are evident in the NEM. This behaviour has impacts on regional prices, generators’ dispatch volume, and thus earnings obtained by generators. However, the historical bootstrapping procedure applied in the current study could hardly recreate and account for these impacts. Therefore, the EaR measures ignore the potential beneﬁts of strategic behaviour to generators. A future research direction could be to account for this potential value by simulating generators’ bidding behaviour. Electricity derivatives and hedging strategies Although the studies in this thesis are focused on electricity spot prices, as Rai and Nunn (2020) argued, forward prices are of the same, or of even more, importance for electricity markets. Typically, most of the capacity of new-entrant generators is contracted to secure their supply and reduce their investment risk, particularly in the case of VRE generators for whom most life-cycle costs are incurred before any revenue is obtained. Further, retailers in electricity markets usually buy electricity at varying spot prices and sell it to consumers at ﬁxed prices, and thus tend to enter into forward contracts to increase the purchase price certainty and minimise their risk of exposure to high spot prices. Therefore, extended studies based on electricity forward 236 Chapter 5. Conclusion prices will be valuable. In addition, due to the substantial volatility in electricity markets, various ﬁnancial derivatives are available for participants to hedge diﬀerent types of risks, for example, the ‘300 Cap Futures’ in the NEM, which is designed to manage the risk of extreme prices above $300/MWh, and ﬁnancial transmission rights, such as the interregional settlement residue auctions in the NEM that allow future interregional price diﬀerence to be traded. Modelling the payoﬀs of these contracts and relating the payoﬀ distribution to estimated spillover eﬀects and extremal dependence will potentially provide important insights for the development of eﬀective intra- and inter-market hedging strategies. Earnings-at-risk analysis of generation portfolios As discussed in Chapter 4, investors and regulators have substantial opportunities to incorporate a combination of VREs and dispatchable generators to reduce the risk of the cannibalisation eﬀect, increase the potential proﬁts of the invested portfolio and im- prove the overall eﬃciency and stability of electricity supply in the market. Therefore, a future study on the earnings potential and risks associated with investment in a com- bination of VREs and dispatchable generation assets, and in particular, dispatchable renewables, will be of signiﬁcant interest. Five-Minute settlement rule change As discussed in Chapter 3, the mismatch of the dispatch interval (i.e. 5-minute interval) and settlement interval (i.e. half-hourly interval) creates the opportunity for generators to proﬁt through strategic biddings, which leads to ineﬃciencies in the operation and generation mix in the NEM and undesirable consequences such as unnecessary price hikes and counter-price ﬂow (i.e. electricity ﬂows from a high price area to a low price area). With the aim to solve the strategic bidding problem, Australian Energy Market Commission (2017) and Australian Energy Market Commission (2020) made a rule change to align settlement and dispatch at ﬁve minutes, starting from 1 October 2021. The upcoming rule change is expected to reduce the strategic bidding and rebidding discussed in Chapter 3, which involves creating price spikes by withholding capacity 237 Chapter 5. Conclusion in the ﬁrst 5-minute dispatch interval and then adding capacity for the rest of the same half-hourly interval to obtain a high average dispatch price. The alignment of settlement and dispatch intervals will largely eliminate the opportunity for generators to beneﬁt from the above strategies since they can only obtain the high price for a signiﬁcantly reduced dispatch amount within a period as short as ﬁve minutes. This could lead to a series of interesting new results relevant to our analysis. Firstly, the implementation of ﬁve-minute settlement is expected to mitigate the un- desirable eﬀects of strategic behaviours. With less incentive for generators to conduct capacity withholding and strategic bidding, oﬀers from generators could be closer to real regional supply ability. The settlement price could be more reﬂective of the un- derlying supply-demand relationship. As a result, artiﬁcial price spikes and occasions of counter-price ﬂow caused by misleading bids are expected to be reduced. A renewed extremogram analysis similar to Section 3.4.4 in Chapter 3 is expected to capture the reduction of manipulated spikes, while mitigated counter-price ﬂow could be examined through a cross-extremogram analysis. Secondly, as argued by Clements et al. (2016) and Dungey et al. (2018), strategic bidding behaviours and capacity withholding are considered as natural consequences of the exercise of market power by generators which reﬂects a failure of regulatory policy. With the implementation of the ﬁve-minute settlement and the strategic behaviours to become less proﬁtable, potential issues of market power will be mitigated, especially in more concentrated regions such as QLD and TAS, including extreme local prices, high price volatility and substantial price diﬀerence compared with the rest of regions in the NEM. As a result, the inter-regional price convergence and overall market integration level across the NEM will be improved, which will lead to more signiﬁcant spillover eﬀects. Meanwhile, net spillover directions between diﬀerent regions could be changed along with the improved price convergence between more concentrated markets and other regions as well as the reduced counter-price ﬂow occasions. Thirdly, since the shorter settlement horizon requires more fast-starting and ﬂexible generations to respond to ﬁve-minute price ﬂuctuations, the transition to ﬁve-minute 238 Chapter 5. Conclusion settlement provide an incentive for investment in fast response technologies such as batteries, gas and hydro generators. For example, in 2019, Origin Energy upgraded its gas peaking plant in SA with expanded capacity, and AGL’s new SA reciprocating engine power station Barker Inlet plant started operating (Rai et al., 2019). Potential new investment in generation technologies in response to ﬁve-minute settlement is expected to cause further changes in generation mix in the NEM, which will further change the market supply, generators’ EaRs and market price behaviours. Therefore, re-estimate spillover eﬀects, extremograms and generators’ EaRs in the future with updated data under ﬁve-minute settlement setting in the NEM will be of signiﬁcant interest and potentially provide important insights on the price, volatility, supply-demand relationship and risk management strategies in electricity markets. 239 References References Aderounmu, A.A., Wolﬀ, R., 2014a.
