The return of DonaldTrump as president might start setting things straight — thatʼs thehope, at least, among the 12 men in our latest Times Opinion focusgroup. They all voted for Mr. Trump in November not only becausethey liked his views on the economy, crime and immigration but 1/16/25, 7:50 AM Opinion | Masculinity, Podcasts and Trump: 12 Men Discuss - The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/16/opinion/men-trump-voters-focus-group.html?campaign_id=39&emc=edit_ty_20250116&instance_id=144873&nl=opinion-today&regi_id=9055769&segm… 4/43also because many of them believe heʼs “a manʼs man” whosegovernment leadership and approach to American culture will helpmany men who feel devalued, overlooked, lost or isolated.“One of the reasons so many young men probably voted for DonaldTrump is they're having trouble ﬁnding their way in our currentsociety,” argued one of our participants, Matthew, a 43-year-old fromTennessee.With Mr. Trump preparing to take ofﬁce on Monday, we wanted todig into why one of his core constituencies — men who prefer JoeRogan, Tucker Carlson, YouTube and X over the mainstream media— put so much trust in these sources of information and believethat Mr. Trump, in particular, has their backs. We spoke with a mixof Republicans, Democrats and one independent of various ages,races and ethnicities and professions.Why do these men trust what they trust? Time and again, they saidthey were drawn to qualities like common sense, curiosity andfreewheeling debate and to people with strong beliefs who arewilling to go toe-to-toe with anyone. Listening to the men, you cansee why Mark Zuckerberg, who recently appeared on Mr. Roganʼspodcast, shelved the fact-checking operation at Meta: They saidtheir views were shaped in part by conversation and debates onpodcasts that could last hours and not from news and social mediasources that provided fact-checking that the men didnʼt have faith in. 1/16/25, 7:50 AM Opinion | Masculinity, Podcasts and Trump: 12 Men Discuss - The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/16/opinion/men-trump-voters-focus-group.html?campaign_id=39&emc=edit_ty_20250116&instance_id=144873&nl=opinion-today&regi_id=9055769&segm… 5/43The most robust debates in the group were about what constituted a“manʼs man” — a theme that kept coming up — and why somemen feel isolated or depressed in society today. For the most part,though, they were optimistic about the future under Mr. Trump andhis allies. “Iʼve been an Elon Musk fan since before probably most ofyou knew who Elon was,” said Jon, a 45-year-old fromPennsylvania. “And the fact that I have a chance to live in anAmerica where Elon and Vivek Ramaswamy are charged withridding the government of fraud, waste and abuse — thatʼs theAmerica I want to live in.”Patrick Healy, Kristen Soltis Anderson and Adrian J.

He’s quick on his feet. He’s anattorney by training. He goes to debate forums andcolleges. He goes into the belly of the beast. He’svery analytical, has the facts, well researched. Itjust gives you an aura of credibility.Moderator, Patrick HealyWhat do you mean by going “into the belly of thebeast”?Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorneyI think a lot of left-wing groups will often protestwhen he goes to campuses to try to prevent himfrom speaking. He’s been on Jubilee, where it’s,like, 20 folks from the left debate one person on theright or vice versa. He’s not afraid to debate reallyanyone or anything in any place, and I like that. 1/16/25, 7:50 AM Opinion | Masculinity, Podcasts and Trump: 12 Men Discuss - The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/16/opinion/men-trump-voters-focus-group.html?campaign_id=39&emc=edit_ty_20250116&instance_id=144873&nl=opinion-today&regi_id=9055769&seg… 11/43Ron G., 55, Kentucky, white, Republican, nurseTrust is very difficult because you get fed all kindsof information from all different sides, andunfortunately we’ve been fed a lot of wrong truths.I listened to Charlie Kirk a lot.

A lotof what’s in newspapers and the drive-by media,it’s just not common-sense facts there. It’s commonsense what a lot of podcasters say. My top threewould definitely be Ben Shapiro, Charlie Kirk andBill O’Reilly.Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business ownerI’m looking for hosts that approach a topic out ofcuriosity. I love the “All In” podcast for that reason.There’s four hosts, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.They approach topics from a point of curiosity. Ialso really enjoy Lex Fridman. He just interviewedVolodymyr Zelensky. Those can be difficult becauseLex’s interviews are often three hours, but thelegacy media is so anti-intellectual that it drives meto long-form content. I want to get to really knowhow people got to their beliefs.Ken, 39, western U.S., Paciﬁc Islander, Democrat, teacherYeah, Joe Rogan usually does interviews that arethree hours long.

Do you feel it’s more valuable than what youlearned in school?Ron G., 55, Kentucky, white, Republican, nurseBack in my college days, I probably didn’t have asmuch interest in politics or learning any more thanwhat I needed to learn. Today, I’m a family man. Ihave more interest in what’s going on in thecountry and how it affects me and my family andmy growth for the future. Church and faith haveprobably caused me to lean towards trying to findout what’s going on about current events.Moderator, Patrick HealyIs there a difference between your male friends and yourfemale friends, in terms of who each group follows onpodcasts or YouTube or where they get their informationfrom? 1/16/25, 7:50 AM Opinion | Masculinity, Podcasts and Trump: 12 Men Discuss - The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/16/opinion/men-trump-voters-focus-group.html?campaign_id=39&emc=edit_ty_20250116&instance_id=144873&nl=opinion-today&regi_id=9055769&seg… 15/43Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, ministerYes. That’s probably why I like listening to BenShapiro and Charlie Kirk. I have friends who areultrafar left or ultrafar right. I was the firstconservative Republican in my family. There’s a lotof butting of heads. Listening to those podcastssometimes gives me an insight into how I canapproach a conversation with somebody.Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business ownerMy hunch is that men are more prone to listeningto long-form content, which I think wasindisputable on the right this election cycle. Menhave more solitary jobs where they can listen tolong-form content; we’re on the road. Females justhave more family responsibilities. It’s hard for afemale to sit down for three hours and listen to JoeRogan or Lex Fridman. It’s easier for dudes.Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorneyMy female friends probably have less overallinterest in political podcasts. You probably see lessof the Joe Rogans and testosterone-fueled podcastsand more traditional, intellectual, Ben Shapirotypes.

And I felt like they lied to me about thelacrosse kids with Duke. They just were soemphatic that they were guilty. I just checked out.They lost me.

At least that’s my hope.Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business ownerI couldn’t say it much better than Matthew. I thinka lot will depend on the next 90 days — howconfirmations to cabinet positions go.

I work for a manufacturingcompany, and we have been decimated by foreignimports, to the point where I’m probably going tobe without a job within the next year because theseimports have taken away our ability to sell ourproduct when overseas companies are selling themfor less.

Maybe thependulum swung a little too far.Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorneyI don’t think young women have it easy, either, justto be clear. But one of the reasons so many youngmen probably voted for Donald Trump is they’rehaving trouble finding their way in our currentsociety. The things ranging from the #MeToomovement, “believe all women, no matter what.” Ithink that intimidated a lot of young men. You lookat academic scores.

The large group ofmen that are left are often isolated and lonelybecause there are fewer young women their age tohave relationships with. I think it’s largely relatedto hookup culture.

I don’t have kid stuff to dealwith anymore. So I had to be intentional. I’vegotten involved in men’s groups through mychurch. There’s areas where you can volunteer. If Isit at home and go, “Well, I’m worried about whatdo people think,” then I’m going to be lonely.Technology can be great, but I think our youngpeople have not learned how to communicate andsocialize because they hide behind a keyboard or agaming station and don’t know how to haveconversations like we’re having here. I think we’redoing a disservice to our young people by nothelping them be in more social settings wherethey’re learning how to treat each other withdignity, manners, respect, even in our differences.You don’t have to be lonely. But you’re going tohave to be vulnerable.
