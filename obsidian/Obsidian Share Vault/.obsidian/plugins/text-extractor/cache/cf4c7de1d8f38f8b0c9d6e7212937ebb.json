Observation, Impacts, Energie (Sophia Antipolis, France) PARTNER Approach  To achieve the objective of this work, a 10-year solar irradiation data in tropical area of West Africa downloaded from SoDa-pro CAMS services is used as an example for this analysis.  Distribution of monthly basis different percentiles solar irradiation level (figure 1) shows important solar variability in summer. For a better understanding of solar variability, a further study of transition between different levels is proceeded.  In order to simplify the process, the sky-state of each timestep (1-min) is classified in four types (clear sky, slightly cloudy, cloudy and variable) by using the method proposed by Tina et al. (2012). Then, they are grouped by 5 x [1-min], regardless the order of minute within block, 56 combinations maximum in theory and after filtering rare cases with occurrence less than 0.5% of all combinations, only 6 combinations left for August data, as shown in figure 2.1.

To mitigate the solar variability, several options are possible, such as using storage system, solar forecasting and/or dedicated Power Management System (PMS), etc. In order to properly size the hybrid system, a study about solar variability is necessary.  This work aims at characterizing the solar variability and predictability of certain zone primarily to find out the most suitable solution and the potentiality of building a hybrid power plant.  As a result of variability analysis, the transition matrix-P(figure 2.2) provides us the transition probability between different combinations. We assumed that solar variability follows the Markovian properties, with the help of Markov chain method of order 1, an N-step forecasting could be achieved by multiplying the transition matrix itself to generate new transition matrix PN.  This analysis is a simple tool to evaluate the solar variability and predictability of certain area to find out the best hybrid system design.  Next step is to characterize the typical and minimum clear sky index of each combination (figure 4), it could be used with the Clear-sky GHI to provide irradiation information as a probabilistic solar forecasting.  Our work could be used as a “fallback” procedure of PMS to maintain the stability of electrical grid in case of dysfunction of standard forecast. figure 2.1 : composition of filtered 5 min combinations and its occurrences figure 2.2 : 1-step and 3-step Transition matrix between different combinations figure 3 : Confusion matrix between predicted and real data figure 4.

Results & Discussions  To evaluate the prediction performance, another 2-year data of same location is downloaded as test data. For the assessment, a comparison between test data and its prediction in red square, which is the most probable combination of N- step transition matrix, is proceeded. The confusion matrix between prediction and test data is used to give a direct view of the prediction accuracy.  For August data, the result shows, excluding \"Variable\" case, all combinations with only 1 sky state during 5 min, the accuracy of 1-step transition > 93%, and for 3-step transition is > 69% (figure 3). And for January, the result of 3-step transition accuracy is > 77%. Quantifying the predictability from these results shows us that it is more predictable in January than in August. figure 1 : Monthly basis different percentiles irradiation level of 10 years data in West Africa  Cohen's kappa coefficient is also introduced to evaluate the model performance, but in this work, the agreement is between prediction and observation instead of using two observations. The score for combinations with only 1 sky state are all higher than 0.9, which are in “almost perfect agreement” range. = P t -> t+1 = P3 t -> t+3 2 3 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
