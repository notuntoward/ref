November 27, 2024 4 min 1128 Less noticed than it should have been in the upheaval of this election season: 2024 was a bad year for ranked-choice voting initiatives and other reforms that could help repair our polarized politics. Under various ranked-choice systems, voters don’t cast a ballot for just a single candidate, starting with a party primary; they select their favorite among all the options available to them, and then their second-favorite, and then rank the rest of their preferences down the line. Then “instant runoffs” are held, in which the last-place finishers drop off and their votes get redistributed to the candidates who ranked second among their supporters. It all sounds more complicated than it is in practice. And because candidates compete not just for their own most avid supporters but also to be the second and third choice of those who vote for others, the ultimate winner is theoretically more likely to be someone who is more moderate, more independent and more inclined toward finding consensus. The system has been gradually growing in popularity, especially for local elections. As of October, it had been used in two states, three counties and 45 cities across the country, according to the organization FairVote. But this year, in every state where voters had the option of implementing ranked-choice voting — Colorado, Idaho, Nevada and Oregon — they rejected it, mostly by large margins. Missouri handily passed a measure expressly prohibiting it. And Alaska, which is the only state other than Maine that employs ranked-choice voting in its elections, came breathtakingly close to abandoning it. The repeal effort — led in part by former governor Sarah Palin (R), who in 2022 lost a three-way race for a U.S. House seat in the state’s first ranked-choice election — failed by a mere 664 votes, out of more than 340,000 cast. The only places where ranked-choice voting ballot initiatives succeeded were a handful of local jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia, which also opened its primary elections to allow independents to vote. Nor was ranked-choice voting the only election reform effort that fared poorly in 2024. Voters in Ohio rejected a constitutional amendment that would have set up a citizen-led redistricting commission in place of an existing system that has repeatedly produced unconstitutional maps that favor Republicans. What may have been partly to blame was deliberately confusing language on the ballot, which made it appear that the amendment would require gerrymandering rather than alleviate it. The defeat of so many efforts at election reform is a discouraging turn. As I’ve argued before, one of the greatest drivers of political polarization are party primaries, which are low-turnout affairs that all too often reward the most extreme candidates on the ballot. In the U.S. House, for instance, fewer than 1 in 5 districts are competitive, which means that the vast majority of congressional elections are decided in the primary. Ranked-choice voting loosens the hold the political parties have on the process in another way: Voters can cast a ballot for third-party contenders without worrying that their preferred candidate may be a “spoiler” who helps their least-favorite win. Supporters of ranked-choice voting, including the organization Unite America, blame their defeats in part on $15 million spent on opposition by Democratic and Republican operations intent on preserving the status quo. Plus, the fact that this was a presidential election year sent voters into their partisan corners. “A polarized environment makes this work more difficult,” Unite America Executive Director Nick Troiano told me. So what’s next for the election reform movement? “We’re disappointed but not deterred,” Troiano said. “We need a longer runway.” Ballot initiatives are not the only path forward; state legislatures also are looking at changes to voting procedures. And while ranked-choice voting remains a bridge too far in many places, less ambitious reforms may be more palatable. For instance, Pennsylvania is currently one of 10 states in which only voters who are registered in major parties may participate in those parties’ primary elections, which leaves out the more than 1.3 million people registered as independents or members of other parties. In October, a strong bipartisan majority in the Pennsylvania House voted in favor of a resolution that would eliminate these closed primaries. It would be naive to believe that what ails our political system can be fixed by adopting reforms such as ranked- choice voting alone. But it would be a start. It is well past time to come up with a system for rewarding politicians who seek to reach across our political divide rather than making it wider.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
