Validation of radiation models and algorithms implemented in 17 building energy simulation codes is an essential endeavor for evaluating solar gain models. Seven solar 18 radiation models implemented in four building energy simulation codes were investigated: 1) isotropic sky, 19 2) Klucher 3) Hay-Davies, 4) Reindl, 5) Muneer, 6) 1987 Perez, and 7) 1990 Perez models. Solar radiation 20 data from two 25 days period in October and March/April, which included diverse atmospheric conditions 21 and solar altitudes, measured on the EMPA campus in a suburban area in Duebendorf, Switzerland, were 22 used for validation purposes. Two of the three measured components of solar irradiances—global horizontal, 23 diffuse horizontal and direct-normal—were used as inputs for calculating global irradiance on a south-west 24 façade. Numerous statistical parameters were employed to analyze hourly measured and predicted global 25 vertical irradiances. Mean absolute deviations for both periods were found to be: 1) 13.7% and 14.9% for the 26 isotropic sky model, 2) 9.1% for the Hay-Davies model, 3) 9.4 % for the Reindl model, 4) 7.6% for the 27 Muneer model, 5) 13.2% for the Klucher model, 6) 9.0%, 7.7%, 6.6%, and 7.1% for the 1990 Perez models, 28 and 7) 7.9% for the 1987 Perez model. Detailed sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo and Fitted Effects 29 for N-way Factorial analyses were applied to assess how uncertainties in input parameters propagated 30 through one of the building energy simulation codes and impacted the output parameter. The implications of 31 deviations in computed solar irradiances on predicted thermal behavior and cooling load of buildings are 32 discussed. 33 34 1. Introduction 35 In the 21 st century, engineers and architects are relying increasingly on building energy simulation codes to 36 design more energy-efficient buildings. One of the common traits found in new commercial buildings across 37 Europe and the United States is construction with large glazed façades. Accurate modeling of the impact of 38 solar gains through glazing is imperative especially when simulating the thermal behavior of these buildings. 39 Empirical validations of solar gain models are therefore an important and necessary endeavor to provide 40 confidence to developers and modelers that their respective algorithms simulate reality. 41 42 A preliminary step in assessing the performance of the solar gain models is to examine and empirically 43 validate models that compute irradiance on exterior surfaces. Various radiation models for inclined surfaces 44 have been proposed—some of which have been implemented in building energy simulation codes—which 45 include isotropic models (Hottel and Woerz, 1942 as cited by Duffie and Beckman, 1991; Liu and Jordan 46 1960; Badescu, 2002), anisotropic models (Perez et al.,1990, 1986; Gueymard, 1987; Robledo and Soler, 47 2002; Li et al., 2002; Olmo et al., 1999) and models for a clear sky (Robler and Soler, 2002). Comparisons 48 and modifications to these models and their applications to specific regions in the world have also been 49 undertaken (Behr, 1997; Ruiz et al., 2002; Remund et. al., 1998). 50 51 2/12 Nomenclature A anisotropic index, - i, j indices the n-factorial study the represent different levels of input parameters B radiation distribution index, - OU average overall uncertainty calculated for 95% credible limits, , W/m 2 a, b terms that account for the incident angle on the sloped surface, - s sample standard deviation, W/m 2 Dmax maximum difference between experimental and predicted values for a given array, W/m 2 Rb variable geometric factor which is a ratio of tilted and horizontal solar beam irradiance Dmin minimum difference between experimental and predicted values for a given array, W/m 2 u is the specific effects from the n-factorial study, W/m 2 Drms root mean squared difference between experimental and predicted values for a given array, W/m 2 TF tilt factor, - D95% Ninety-fifth percentile of the differences between experimental and predicted values for a given array, W/m 2 UR computed hourly uncertainty ratio for comparing overall performance of a given model d estimated error quantity provided by the manufacturer, units vary UR average uncertainty ratio, - F1 circumsolar coefficient, - URmax maximum uncertainty ratio, - F2 brightness coefficient, - URmin minimum uncertainty ratio, - F’ clearness index, - x xmin xmax arithmetic mean for a given array of data, W/m 2 minimum quantity for a given array of data, W/m 2 maximum quantity for a given array of data, W/m 2 f11, f12, f13, f21, f22, f23 statistically derived coefficients derived from empirical data for specific locations as a function of ε, - Greek Symbols Ibn direct-normal solar irradiance, W/m 2 α absorptance, % Ih global horizontal solar irradiance, W/m 2 αn normal absorptance, % Ih,b direct-normal component of solar irradiance on the horizontal surface, W/m 2 αs solar altitude angle, ° Ih,d global diffuse horizontal solar irradiance, W/m 2 β surface tilt angle from horizon, ° Ion direct extraterrestrial normal irradiance, W/m 2 ∆ sky condition parameter for brightness IT solar irradiance on the tilted surface, W/m 2 ε sky condition parameter for clearness IT,b direct-normal (beam) component of solar irradiance on the tilted surface, W/m 2 φb building azimuth, ° IT,d diffuse component of solar irradiance on the tilted surface, W/m 2 θ incident angle of the surface, ° IT,d,iso isotropic diffuse component of solar irradiance on the tilted surface, W/m 2 θz zenith angle,° IT,d,cs circumsolar diffuse component of solar irradiance on the tilted surface, W/m 2 ξ input parameter n-way factorial, units vary IT,d,hb horizontal brightening diffuse component of solar irradiance on the tilted surface, W/m 2 ρ hemispherical-hemispherical ground reflectance, - IT,d,g reflected ground diffuse component of solar irradiance on the tilted surface, W/m 2 σ standard deviation n-way factorial, units vary In all empirical validations, accounting for uncertainties in the experiment and input parameters is 1 paramount. Sensitivity analysis is a well-established technique in computer simulations (Saltelli et al. 2004, 2 2000; Santer et al., 2003) and has been implemented in building energy simulation codes (Macdonald and 3 3/12 Strachan, 2001) and empirical validations (Mara et al., 2001; Aude et al., 2000; Fürbringer and Roulet, 1999, 1 1995; Lomas and Eppel, 1992) for many years. A thorough methodology for sensitivity analysis for 2 calculations, correlation analysis, principle component analysis, and implementation in the framework of 3 empirical validations in IEA-SHC Task 22 are described by Palomo Del Barrio and Guyon (2004; 2003). 4 5 In the context of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) SHC Task 34/ ECBCS Annex 43 Subtask C, a 6 series of empirical validations is being performed in a test cell to assess the accuracy of solar gain models in 7 building energy simulation codes with/without shading devices and frames. A thorough description of the 8 proposed suite of experiments, description of the cell, rigorous evaluation of the cell thermophysical 9 properties and thermal bridges, and a methodology for examining results are reported by Manz et al. (2005). 10 11 In virtually all building energy simulation applications, solar radiation must be calculated on tilted surfaces. 12 These calculations are driven by solar irradiation inputs or appropriate correction factors and clear sky 13 models. While the horizontal irradiation is virtually always measured, measuring of direct-normal and/or 14 diffuse irradiance adds an additional level of accuracy (Note: In the absence of the latter two parameters, 15 models have to be used to split global irradiation into direct and diffuse). 16 17 The purpose of this work is to validate seven solar radiation models on tilted surfaces that are implemented 18 in widely used building energy simulation codes including: EnergyPlus(2005), DOE-2.1e(2002), ESP-r 19 (2005), and TRNSYS-TUD (2005). The seven models examined include: 20 • Isotropic sky (Hottel and Woertz, 1942 as cited by Duffie and Beckman, 1991) 21 • Klucher (1979) 22 • Hay-Davies(1980) 23 • Reindl (1990) 24 • Muneer (1997) 25 • Perez (1987) 26 • Perez (1990) 27 28 Two of three measured irradiance components were used in each simulation and predictions of global 29 vertical irradiance on a façade oriented 29° West of South were compared with measurements. Particular 30 emphasis was placed on quantifying how uncertainty in the input parameters―direct-normal, diffuse and 31 horizontal global solar irradiance as well as ground reflectance and surface azimuth angle―propagated 32 through radiation calculation algorithms and impacted the global vertical irradiance calculation. Sensitivity 33 analyses were performed using both the Monte Carlo Analysis (MCA) and Fitted Effects for N-way 34 Factorials. 35 36 2. Solar Radiation Models 37 Total solar irradiance on a tilted surface can be divided into two components: 1) the beam component from 38 direct irradiation of the tilted surface and 2) the diffuse component. The sum of these components equates to 39 the total irradiance on the tilted surface and is described in Equation 1. 40 dTbTT III ,, += [1] 41 Studies of clear skies have led to a description of the diffuse component being composed of an isotropic 42 diffuse component (uniform irradiance from the sky dome), circumsolar diffuse component (resulting from 43 the forward scattering of solar radiation and concentrated in an area close to the sun), horizon brightening 44 component (concentrated in a band near the horizon and most pronounced in clear skies), and a reflected 45 component that quantifies the radiation reflected from the ground to the tilted surface. A more complete 46 version of Equation 1 containing all diffuse components is given in Equation 2. 47 gdThbdTcsdTisodTbTT IIIIII ,,,,,,,,, ++++= [2] 48 4/12 For a given location (longitude, latitude) at any given time of the year (date, time) the solar azimuth and 1 altitude can be determined applying geometrical relationships. Therefore, the incidence angle of beam 2 radiation on a tilted surface can be computed. The models described in this paper all handle beam radiation 3 in this way so the major modeling differences are calculations of the diffuse radiation. An overview of solar 4 radiation modeling used for thermal engineering is provided in numerous textbooks including Duffie and 5 Beckman (1991) and Muneer (1997). Solar radiation models with different complexity which are widely 6 implemented in building energy simulation codes will be briefly described in the following sections. 7 8 2.1 Isotropic Sky Model 9 The isotropic sky model (Hottel and Woerz, 1942 as cited by Duffie and Beckman, 1991; Liu and Jordan, 10 1960) is the simplest model that assumes all diffuse radiation is uniformly distributed over the sky dome and 11 that reflection on the ground is diffuse. For surfaces tilted by an angle β from the horizontal plane, total solar 12 irradiance can be written as 13 ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − +⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ + += 2 1 I 2 1 IRII hdhbbhT β ρ β coscos ,, [3] 14 Circumsolar and horizon brightening parts (Eq. 2) are assumed to be zero. 15 16 2.2 Klucher Model 17 Klucher (1979) found that the isotopic model gave good results for overcast skies but underestimates 18 irradiance under clear and partly overcast conditions, when there is increased intensity near the horizon and 19 in the circumsolar region of the sky. The model developed by Klucher gives the total irradiation on a tilted 20 plane shown in Equation 4. 21 [ ] ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − +′+⎥ ⎦ ⎤ ⎢ ⎣ ⎡ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛′+⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ + += 2 cos1 IsincosF1 2 sinF1 2 cos1 IRII hz 323 d,hbb,hT β ρϑϑ ββ [4] 22 F’ is a clearness index given by Equation 5. 23 2 ,1 ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ −=′ h dh I I F [5] 24 The first of the modifying factors in the sky diffuse component takes into account horizon brightening; the 25 second takes into account the effect of circumsolar radiation. Under overcast skies, the clearness index F’ 26 becomes zero and the model reduces to the isotropic model. 27 28 2.3 Hay-Davies Model 29 In the Hay-Davies model, diffuse radiation from the sky is composed of an isotropic and circumsolar 30 component (Hay and Davies, 1980) and horizon brightening is not taken into account. The anisotropy index 31 A defined in Equation 6 represents the transmittance through atmosphere for beam radiation. 32 on bn I I A = [6] 33 The anisotropy index is used to quantify a portion of the diffuse radiation treated as circumsolar with the 34 remaining portion of diffuse radiation assumed isotropic.

Due to the additional term in 4 Equation 8 representing horizon brightening, the Reindl model provides slightly higher diffuse irradiances 5 than the Hay-Davies model. 6 7 2.5 Muneer Model 8 Muneer’s model is summarized by Muneer (1997). In this model the shaded and sunlit surfaces are treated 9 separately, as are overcast and non-overcast conditions of the sunlit surface.

Two different sets of coefficients were derived for this model (Perez et al, 1990; 1988 as 5 cited by Duffie and Beckman, 1991). An earlier version of the model with different coefficients (Perez 6 1987) was also included in this analysis. 7 8 3. Facility and Measurements 9 3.1 Test Site and Setup 10 The solar radiation measurements were performed on the EMPA campus located in Duebendorf, Switzerland 11 (Longitude 8°36’55”, Latitude 47°24’12”). Figure 1 shows the facility which was designed to measure solar 12 gains of transparent façade components; a detailed description of facility is provided by Manz et al. (2005). 13 For this study, only the pyranometers and the pyrheliometer at the facility were used (Figures 1 and 2). For 14 the diffuse measurements, a shading disk was mounted in front of the pyranometer with the same solid angle 15 as the pyrheliometer that blocked out the beam irradiance component (Figure 2). In order to evaluate the 16 robustness of various radiation models, two 25 day periods were studied to compare predicted irradiance on 17 the tilted façade with measured data that were recorded by a pyranometer mounted on the vertical surface 18 (29° West of South) of the test cell. The dates of the first and second periods were October 2 to October 26, 19 2004 and March 22 to April 16, 2005, respectively. Both periods include a range of different atmospheric 20 conditions and solar positions. The solar radiation data were acquired for 600 h for each period. 21 22 3.2 Solar Irradiance 23 Table 1 indicates measured parameters, type of instrument used and accuracies of sensors specified by the 24 manufacturers. To verify the accuracy of the instrumentation, the global horizontal irradiance can be 25 calculated using solar position and direct-normal and horizontal diffuse irradiance shown in Equation 19. 26 d,hsn,bh IsinII += α [19] 27 The differences between global horizontal irradiance measured and computed based on direct-normal (beam) 28 and horizontal diffuse irradiance were analyzed. Using the experimental uncertainties described in Table 1, 29 95% credible limits were calculated for the measured global horizontal irradiance using manufacturer’s error 30 and for the computed global irradiance using propagation of error techniques (uncertainty analysis) assuming 31 uniform distributions (Glesner, 1998). From these comparisons, the 95% credible limits from the calculated 32 and measured global horizontal irradiance for Periods 1 and 2 were found to overlap 78.0% and 70.1% of the 33 time, respectively; these calculations were only performed when the sun was up (αS>0). Careful 34 examination of these results reveals that the discrepancies occurred when the solar altitude angles and 35 irradiance were small or the solar irradiance were very large (especially for Period 2). Linear regression 36 analysis was used to compare the computed and measured global irradiances. The results from this analysis 37 are shown for Periods 1 and 2 in Figures 3a and 3b, respectively. The differences between calculated and 38 measured quantities are apparent from the slopes of lines. These results reveal a slight systematic under-39 prediction by roughly 3% of global horizontal irradiance when calculating it from the beam and diffuse 40 horizontal irradiance components. 41 42 3.3 Ground Reflectance 43 The importance of accurately quantifying the albedo in lieu of relying on default values is discussed in detail 44 by Ineichen et al. (1987). Therefore, in order to have a well-defined and uniform ground reflectance, 45 artificial green turf was installed in front of the test cell to represent a typical outdoor surface (Figure 1). 46 47 7/12 Reflectance of a sample of the artificial turf was measured at almost perpendicular (3°) incident radiation in 1 the wavelength interval between 250 nm and 2500 nm using an integrating sphere (Figure 4) which could not 2 be employed for angular dependent measurements. Specular components of the reflectance were measured at 3 incident angles of 20°, 40°, and 60° and were found to be less than 1%; therefore the surface was considered 4 to be a Lambertian surface (Modest, 2003). Integral values for reflectance were determined according to EN 5 410 (1998) by means of GLAD software (2002). Hemispherical-hemispherical reflectance was then 6 determined at each wavelength assuming an angular dependent surface absorptance as shown in Equation 20 7 (from Duffie and Beckman, 1991). 8 9 ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ ⎨ ⎧ ≤≤+− ≤≤××+××+ = oo oo 90807650640 80010799.4-10324.51099.1-100345.21 8-36-24-3- n θθ θθθθθ α θα .. )( 4 [20] 10 Equation 21 was used to calculate the hemispherical-hemispherical reflectance. 11 ()∫ −= o o 90 0 d12 θθθθαρ )cos()sin()( [21] 12 This integral was evaluated numerically using the Engineering Equation Solver (Klein, 2004). The computed 13 solar ground reflectance (Table 2) corresponds well with albedo measurements described by Ineichen et al. 14 (1987). 15 16 4. Simulations 17 The incident (global vertical) irradiance on the exterior façade for all the building energy simulation codes 18 was a function of the solar irradiance and ground reflectance. Four building energy simulation codes, 19 EnergyPlus, DOE-2.1e, ESP-r and TRNSYS-TUD, which included seven different radiation models were 20 evaluated for both periods. 21 22 EnergyPlus version 1.2.2 uses the 1990 Perez model. For the simulation, measured direct-normal and diffuse 23 horizontal solar irradiance were used as inputs in 10 minute time steps. DOE-2.1e also uses a Perez 1990 24 model to calculate irradiance on a tilted façade (Buehl, 2005) with hourly inputs of direct-normal and global 25 horizontal solar irradiance. Both EnergyPlus and DOE-2.1e assumed a constant annual direct-normal 26 extraterrestrial irradiation term (they do not factor in the elliptical orbit of the earth around the sun). 27 TRNSYS-TUD allows the user to select from four models and various inputs for solar irradiance. For these 28 experiments, the Isotropic, Hay-Davies, Reindl, and Perez 1990 model were used with inputs of measured 29 direct normal and global horizontal irradiance; the inputs to the models were in 1 hour time steps. An 30 average annual extraterrestrial irradiation term was also assumed for the Perez, Reindl, and Hay-Davies 31 models. ESP-r has the Perez 1990 model as its default, but other models are available to the user, namely the 32 Isotropic, Klucher, Muneer and Perez 1987 models. Measured 6 minutely averaged data were input to the 33 program. The program takes into account variations in the extraterrestrial radiation in the Perez and Muneer 34 models. It is also possible to use direct normal plus diffuse horizontal irradiation, or global horizontal plus 35 diffuse horizontal irradiation as inputs to ESP-r; for this study, only the direct normal and diffuse horizontal 36 inputs were studied. 37 38 5. Sensitivity Analysis 39 Sensitivity studies are an important component in thorough empirical validations; such studies were therefore 40 also performed. The uncertainties in the input parameters were taken from information provided by the 41 manufacturers (Table 1). The error in the ground reflectance calculation (models and measurements 42 combined) was estimated as 5% (see Table 2) and ±1° for the building azimuth. Uniform distributions were 43 assumed for estimated uncertainties and quantities provided by manufacturers (Glesner, 1998). Although all 44 the codes perform solar angle calculations, uncertainties were not assigned to the cell locations (latitude and 45 longitude). Two types of sensitivity analysis were performed for this project in EnergyPlus which included 46 Fitted Effects for N-way Factorials and MCA. For these analyses the source code was not modified, but 47 8/12 rather a “wrap” was designed to modify input parameters in the weather file and the input file for EnergyPlus 1 in MatLab 7.0 (2004). A Visual Basic program was written to create a command line executable program to 2 run the “WeatherConverter” program and the “RunEplus.bat” program was run from the MatLab programs. 3 Output from each run was recorded in output files. A flowchart for this process is depicted in Figure 6. 4 5 5.1. Fitted Effects for N-way Factorials 6 A Fitted Effects N-way Factorial method was used to identify the impact of uncertainties in various 7 parameters on the results (Vardeman and Jobe, 2001). The parameters that were varied for this study 8 included: ground reflectance, direct-normal irradiance, global horizontal irradiance (which was an unused 9 parameter in EnergyPlus), and diffuse irradiance. Therefore, for this study a fitted effects for a three-way 10 factorial analysis was performed. The first step in this process is to run a one-way factorial shown in 11 Equation 22 varying each parameter. 12 )()( iiiiu ξφσξφ −+= [22] 13 For uniform distributions, the standard deviation is estimated in Equation 23. 14 3 d i =σ [23] 15 The two-way factorials were estimated using Equation 24. Additional levels of interactions were considered 16 but were found to be negligible. 17 ( ) ji ),(),( ≠++−++= jijijjiiij uuu ξξφσξσξφ [24] 18 The overall uncertainty was estimated using the quadrature summation shown in Equation 25. 19 ∑∑+= 2 ij 2 i uuu [25] 20 This analysis assumes a localized linear relationship where the function is evaluated. To confirm this 21 assumption, estimates were made by forward differencing ( ii σξ + ) and backward differencing ( ii σξ − ). The 22 individual factorials can also be analyzed to assess their impact. In Table 3, the results from this analysis 23 averaged over the entire test (αS > 0) are shown for both forward and backward differencing. Looking at the 24 results from forward and backward difference, the assumed localized linear relationship seems reasonable 25 but may lead to minor discrepancies that are discussed later. 26 27 5.2. Monte Carlo Analysis 28 The Monte Carlo method can be used to analyze the impact of all uncertainties simultaneously by randomly 29 varying input parameters and performing multiple evaluations of the output parameter(s). When setting up 30 the analysis, the inputs are modified according to a probability density function (pdf) and, after numerous 31 iterations, the outputs are assumed to be Gaussian (normal) by the Central Limit Theorem. The error is 32 estimated by taking the standard deviation of the multiple evaluations at each time step. MatLab 7.0 can be 33 used to generate random numbers according to Gaussian, uniform, and many other distributions. A 34 comprehensive description and the underlying theory behind the Monte Carlo Method are provided by 35 Fishman (1996) and Rubinstein (1981). 36 37 5.2.1. Sampling 38 For this study, Latin hypercube sampling was used. In this method, the range of each input factor is divided 39 into equal probability intervals based on the number of runs of the simulation; one value is then taken from 40 each interval. When applying this method for this study given parameters with non-uniform distributions, 41 the intervals were defined using the cumulative distribution function and then one value was selected from 42 each interval assuming a uniform distribution (again this was simplified in using MatLab because the 43 functions were part of the code). This method of sampling is better when a few components of input 44 dominate the output (Saltelli et al., 2000). For this study, the input parameters were all sampled from a 45 uniform distribution. Previous studies have shown that after 60-80 there are only slight gains in accuracy 46 (Fürbringer and Roulet, 1995), but 120 runs were used to determine uncertainty. The average overall 47 uncertainties (αS > 0) for Periods 1 and 2 were 2.35 W/m 2 and 2.87 W/m 2, respectively; the results 48 9/12 corresponded well with the fitted effects models. The results at any given time step are discussed in the next 1 section. 2 3 5.2.2. Analysis of Output 4 It can be shown that despite the pdf’s for input parameters, the output parameters will always have a 5 Gaussian distribution (given a large enough sample and sufficient number of inputs) by the Central Limit 6 Theorem; therefore a Lilliefore Test for goodness of fit to normal distribution was used to test significance at 7 5% (when αS > 0). Using this criterion, 27.5% and 11.5% of the outputs from Periods 1 and 2, respectively, 8 were found not to be normally distributed. A careful study of these results reveals that the majority (not all) 9 of these discrepancies occurred when the direct-normal irradiance is small or zero. This may be due to the 10 proportional nature of the uncertainties used for these calculations. At low direct-normal irradiances, the 11 calculation becomes a function of only two inputs rather than three, which could make the pdf for the output 12 parameter more susceptible to the individual pdf’s of the input parameters, which for these cases were 13 uniform distributions. 14 15 5.3 Estimated Uncertainties 16 Estimates for uncertainties were obtained from both Fitted Effects for N-way Factorial and MCA. From 17 these analyses, both methods yield similar results. The only discrepancies for both forward and backward 18 differencing were that fitted effects estimates are sometimes overestimated at several individual time steps. 19 Careful inspection of the individual responses revealed that there was a significant jump in the two-way 20 direct-normal/diffuse response (sometimes in the order of 5 W/m 2) that corresponds to odd behavior in the 21 one-way responses. The response for the rest of the time steps was negligible. Additional review showed 22 that these events do not occur during the same time steps for forward and backward differencing. It was 23 therefore assumed that these discrepancies result from localized non-linearities at these time steps. 24 25 6. Results 26 The computed results from the four simulation codes were compared with the measured global vertical 27 irradiance. Comparisons were made using the nomenclature and methodology proposed by Manz et al. 28 (2005). An important term used for comparing the performance of the respective models in the codes is the 29 uncertainty ratio. This term was computed at each hour (αs > 0) and is shown in Equation 26. The average, 30 maximum, and minimum quantities are summarized in the statistical analyses for each test. Ninety-five 31 percent credible limits were calculated from the MCA for EnergyPlus and the 95% credible limits for the 32 experiment were estimated assuming a uniform distribution. The credible limits from EnergyPlus were used 33 to calculate the uncertainty ratios for all the models and codes. For the uncertainty ratio, terms less than 34 unity indicate that the codes are validated with 95% credible limits. 35 EnergyPlusExperiment OUOU D UR + = [26] 36 Tables 4, 5, and 6 show the results from Periods 1 and 2 and combined periods, respectively. Plots were 37 constructed that depict the global vertical irradiation (hourly averaged irradiance values multiplied by a 1 hr 38 interval) and credible limits. For these plots, the output and 95% credible limits for a given hour of the day 39 were averaged to provide an overview of the performance of each model. Figures 6 to 8 contain results from 40 Periods 1 and 2 and the combined results. 41 42 7. Discussion and Conclusions 43 The accuracy of the individual radiation models and their implementation in each building energy simulation 44 code for both periods can be accurately assessed from the statistical analyses and the plots from the results 45 section. Figure 6 shows that in the morning, there are both over or under-prediction of the global vertical 46 irradiance by the models for Period 1; in the afternoon the global vertical irradiance are significantly under-47 predicted. During Period 2, over-predictions from the statistical analysis can be seen in both the morning 48 and the afternoon from Figure 7, which explains results from the statistical analysis. Combining these results 49 10/12 helps to redistribute the hourly over and under-predictions from each model, but it is still clear all the models 1 performed better during Period 1. 2 3 Using the average uncertainty ratio as a guide, it can be seen that for both periods none of the models were 4 within overlapping 95% credible limits. Strictly speaking, none of the models can therefore be considered to 5 be validated within the defined credible limits ( )( 1RU > . This is partly due to the proportional nature of the 6 error which at vertical irradiance predictions with small uncertainties lead to large hourly uncertainty ratio 7 calculations and the difficulty in deriving a generic radiation model for every location in the world. This is 8 also shown in Figures 6 to 8 where there is very little overlap in the experimental and MCA 95% credible 9 limits. But the average uncertainty ratio can also be used as a guide to rank the overall performance of the 10 tilted radiation models. The Isotropic model performed the worst during these experiments, which can be 11 expected because it was the most simplistic and did not account for the various individual components of 12 diffuse irradiance. While the Reindl and Hay-Davies model accounted for the additional components of 13 diffuse irradiance (both circumsolar and horizontal brightening for the Reindl and circumsolar for the Hay-14 Davies), the Perez formulation—which relied on empirical data to quantify the diffuse components—15 provided the best results for this location and wall orientation. Differences between the Perez models in the 16 four building energy simulation codes can be attributed to solar irradiance input parameters (beam, global 17 horizontal, and diffuse), time steps of the weather measurements, solar angle algorithms, and assumptions 18 made by the programmers (constant direct-normal extraterrestrial radiations for DOE-2.1e and EnergyPlus). 19 For both periods, the assumptions made in the TRNSYS-TUD formulation Perez radiation model performed 20 best. But also from these results, the Muneer model performed quite well without the detail used in the Perez 21 models. In fact, the Muneer model performed better than Perez models formulated in EnergyPlus and DOE-22 2.1e. 23 24 The presented results reveal distinct difference between radiation models that will ultimately manifest 25 themselves in the solar gain calculations. Mean absolute deviations in predicting solar irradiance for both 26 time periods were: 1) 13.7% and 14.9% for the isotropic sky model, 2) 9.1% for the Hay-Davies, 3) 9.4 % 27 for the Reindl, 4) 7.6% for the Muneer model, 5) 13.2% for the Klucher, 6) 9.0%, 7.7%, 6.6%, and 7.1% for 28 the 1990 Perez, and 7) 7.9% for the 1987 Perez models. This parameter is a good estimate of the 29 instantaneous error that would impact peak load calculations. The mean deviations calculations for these 30 time periods were: 1) -5.3% and -7.7% for the isotropic sky model, 2) -1.1% for the Hay-Davies, 3) 2.6% 31 for the Reindl, 4) 2.8% for the Muneer model, 5) -6.2% for the Klucher, 6) 2.6%, 5.0%, 0.5%, and 1.0% for 32 the 1990 Perez, and 7) 3.5% for the 1987 Perez models. From this parameter it can be concluded that 33 building energy simulation codes with advanced radiation models are capable of computing total irradiated 34 solar energy on building façades with a high precision for longer time periods (such as months). Hence, the 35 calculations of building energy consumption with very high prediction accuracy is achievable even in 36 today’s highly glazed buildings, which are largely affected by solar gains. On the other hand, even the most 37 advanced models deviate significantly at specific hourly time steps (up to roughly 100 W/m 2), which poses 38 serious limitations to accuracy of predictions of cooling power at a specific point in time, the short-time 39 temperature fluctuations in the case of non-air conditioned buildings or the control and/or sizing of HVAC 40 equipment or shading devices. When performing building simulations, engineers must consider much higher 41 uncertainties at specific time steps. 42 43 Additional factors that were not investigated include the number of components of solar irradiance measured 44 at a given weather station (often only global horizontal irradiance is measured and other models are used to 45 compute beam irradiance), locations and densities of the weather stations used as inputs for building 46 simulation codes, and reliability of weather files used by building energy simulation codes. 47 48 Note: Radiation data and data of all other experiments within the IEA Task 34 project can be downloaded 49 from our website at www.empa.ch/ieatask34. 50 51 52 53 11/12 Acknowledgements 1 We gratefully acknowledge with thanks the financial support from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (BFE) 2 for building and testing the experimental facility (Project 17’166) as well as the funding for EMPA 3 participation in IEA Task 34/43 (Project 100’765).
