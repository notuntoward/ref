THEIS Deutscher Wetterdienst, Offenbach, Germany PIERRE PINSON Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark (Manuscript received 18 November 2015, in ﬁnal form 8 September 2016) ABSTRACT Probabilistic forecasts in the form of ensembles of scenarios are required for complex decision-making processes. Ensemble forecasting systems provide such products but the spatiotemporal structures of the forecast uncertainty is lost when statistical calibration of the ensemble forecasts is applied for each lead time and location independently. Nonparametric approaches allow the reconstruction of spatiotemporal joint probability distributions at a small computational cost. For example, the ensemble copula coupling (ECC) method rebuilds the multivariate aspect of the forecast from the original ensemble forecasts. Based on the assumption of error stationarity, parametric methods aim to fully describe the forecast dependence structures. In this study, the concept of ECC is combined with past data statistics in order to account for the autocor- relation of the forecast error. The new approach, called d-ECC, is applied to wind forecasts from the high- resolution Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) ensemble prediction system (EPS) run operationally at the German Weather Service (COSMO-DE-EPS). Scenarios generated by ECC and d-ECC are compared and assessed in the form of time series by means of multivariate veriﬁcation tools and within a product-oriented framework. Veriﬁcation results over a 3-month period show that the innovative method d-ECC performs as well as or even outperforms ECC in all investigated aspects. 1. Introduction Uncertainty information is essential for an optimal use of a forecast (Krzysztofowicz 1983). Such information can be provided by an ensemble prediction system (EPS) that aims at describing the ﬂow-dependent forecast un- certainty (Leutbecher and Palmer 2008). Several de- terministic forecasts are run simultaneously, accounting for uncertainties in the description of the initial state, the model parameterization, and, for limited area models, the boundary conditions. Probabilistic products are derived from an ensemble, tailored to a speciﬁc user’s needs. For example, wind forecasts in the form of quantiles at selected probability levels are of particular interest for actors in the renewable energy sector (Pinson 2013). However, probabilistic products generally suffer from a lack of reliability, the system showing biases and failing to fully represent the forecast uncertainty. Sta- tistical techniques allow users to adjust the ensem- ble forecast, correcting for systematic inconsistencies (Gneiting et al. 2007). This step, known as calibration, is based on past data and usually focuses on a single or a few aspects of the ensemble forecast. For example, cal- ibration of a wind forecast can be performed by uni- variate approaches (Bremnes 2004; Sloughter et al. 2010; Thorarinsdottir and Gneiting 2010) or bivariate methods, which account for correlation structures of the wind components (Pinson 2012; Schuhen et al. 2012). These calibration procedures provide reliable predictive probability distributions of wind speed or wind components for each forecast lead time and Corresponding author address: Zied Ben Bouallègue, Deutscher Wetterdienst, Frankfurter Strasse 135, Offenbach 63067, Germany.

Decision-making problems can however require information about the spatial and/or temporal structure of the forecast uncertainty. Examples of application in the renewable energy sector resemble the optimal operation of a wind-storage sys- tem in a market environment, the unit commitment over a control zone, or the optimal maintenance plan- ning (Pinson et al. 2009). In other words, scenarios that describe spatiotemporal wind variability are relevant products for end users of wind forecasts. The generation of scenarios from calibrated ensemble forecasts is a step that can be performed with the use of empirical copulas. The empirical copula approaches are nonparametric and, in comparison with parametric ap- proaches (Keune et al. 2014; Feldmann et al. 2015), simple to implement and computationally cheap. Em- pirical copulas can be based on climatological records [Schaake shufﬂe (ScSh); Clark et al. (2004)]oronthe original raw ensemble [ensemble copula coupling (ECC); Schefzik et al. (2013)]. ECC, which features the conser- vation of the ensemble member rank structure from the original ensemble to the calibrated one, has the advan- tage of being applicable to any location within the model domain without restriction related to the availability of observations. However, unrealistic scenarios can be generated by the ECC approach when the postprocessing indiscriminately increases the ensemble spread to a large extent. Nonrepresentative correlation structures in the raw ensemble are magniﬁed after calibration, leading to unrealistic forecast variability. As a consequence, ECC can deteriorate the ensemble information content when applied to ensembles with relatively poor reliability, as suggested, for example, by the veriﬁcation results in Flowerdew (2014). In this paper, a new version of the ECC approach is proposed to overcome the generation of unrealistic scenarios. Focusing on time series, a temporal compo- nent is introduced into the ECC scheme accounting for the autocorrelation of the forecast error over consecu- tive forecast lead times. The assumption of forecast er- ror stationarity, already adopted for the development of fully parametric approaches (Pinson et al. 2009; Schölzel and Hense 2011), is exploited in combination with the structure information of the original scenarios. The new approach based on these two sources of information, past data and ensemble structure, is called dual-ensemble copula coupling (d-ECC). Objective veriﬁcation is per- formed in order to show the beneﬁts of the proposed approach with regard to the standard ECC. The manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 de- scribes the dataset used to illustrate the manuscript as well as the calibration method applied to derive the calibrated quantile forecasts from the raw ensemble. Sections 3 and 4 introduce the empirical copula ap- proaches for the generation of scenarios and discuss in particular the ECC and d-ECC methods. Section 5 de- scribes the veriﬁcation process for the scenario assess- ment. Section 6 presents the results obtained by means of multivariate scores and within a product-oriented veriﬁcation framework. 2. Data a. Ensemble forecasts and observations COSMO-DE-EPS is the high-resolution Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) EPS run opera- tionally at DWD. It consists of 20 COSMO-DE forecasts with variations in the initial conditions, the boundary conditions, and the model physics (Gebhardt et al. 2011; Peraltaetal. 2012). COSMO-DE-EPS follows the mul- timodel ensemble approach, with four global models each driving ﬁve physically perturbed members. The ensemble conﬁguration implies a clustering of the ensemble mem- bers as a function of the driving global model when large- scale structures dominate the forecast uncertainty. The focus here is on wind forecasts at 100-m height above ground. The postprocessing methods are applied to forecasts of the 0000 UTC run with an hourly output interval and a forecast horizon of up to 21 h. The ob- servation dataset comprises quality-controlled wind measurements from seven stations: Risoe, FINO1, FINO2, FINO3, Karlsruhe, Hamburg, and Lindenberg, as plotted in Fig. 1. The veriﬁcation period covers a 3-month period: March–May 2013. Figure 2a shows an example of a COSMO-DE-EPS wind forecast at hub height. The forecast is valid on day 2 (March 2013) at FINO1 (see Fig. 1). The ensemble members are shown in gray while the corresponding observations are in black. In Fig. 2b, the raw ensemble forecast is interpreted in the form of quantiles. Formally, a quantile qt at probability level t (with 0 # t # 1) is deﬁned as q t d F 21(t) 5 inffy: F(y) $ tg, (1) where F is the cumulative probability distribution of the random variable Y 2<: F(y) 5 P(Y # y) . (2) In practice, at each forecast lead time, the member of rank n can be interpreted as a quantile forecast at probability level tn: tn 5 n N e 1 1, (3) where Ne is the number of ensemble members. 4738 M O NTH L Y W EA TH ER REV I EW VOLUME 144 Unauthenticated | Downloaded 01/27/25 02:52 AM UTC In the example shown in Fig. 2, the raw ensemble is not able to capture the observation variability. Cali- bration aims to correct for this lack of reliability by ad- justing the mean and enlarging the spread of the ensemble forecast. b. Calibrated ensemble forecasts Since COSMO-DE-EPS forecasts have been shown to suffer from statistical inconsistencies (Ben Bouallègue 2013, 2015), calibration has to be applied in order to provide reliable forecasts to the users. The method applied in this study is the bivariate non- homogeneous Gaussian regression (EMOS; Schuhen et al. 2012). The mean and variance of each wind com- ponent, as well as the correlation between the two components, characterize the predictive bivariate nor- mal distribution. Corrections applied to the raw en- semble mean and variance are optimized by minimizing the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS; Matheson and Winkler 1976). The calibration co- efﬁcients are estimated for each station and each lead time separately (local version of EMOS), based on a training period being deﬁned as a moving window of 45 days. The ﬁnal calibrated products considered here are Ne-equidistant forecasts of wind speed estimated for each location and each forecast lead time separately, where the Ne probability levels associated with the forecast quantiles follow Eq. (3). Calibrated quantile forecasts are shown in Fig. 2c. The spread of the en- semble is increased with respect to Fig. 2b and thus the observation variability is now captured by the forecast. From a statistical point of view the calibration method provides reliable ensemble marginal distributions and reliable quantile forecasts as checked by means of rank histograms and quantile reliability plots (not shown). The performance of the applied calibration technique is similar to the results obtained by other methods such as quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett 1978; Bremnes 2004). Information about spatial and temporal dependence structures, which are crucial in many applications, are however no longer available after this calibration step (see Fig. 2c). The next postprocessing step consists then in the generation of consistent scenarios based on the calibrated samples. FIG. 2.

Generation of scenarios The generation of scenarios with empirical copulas is here brieﬂy described. For a deeper insight into the methods, the reader is invited to refer to the original article by Schefzik et al. (2013) or to Wilks (2015) and references within. First, consider the multivariate cumulative distribu- tion function (cdf) G deﬁned as G(y 1, ... , y L) 5 P[Y1 # y1, ... , YL # y L] (4) of a random vector (Y1, ... , YL) with y1, ... , yL 2 R. As in Eq. (2), we deﬁne the marginals Fi as F i(y i) 5 P[Yi # yi]. (5) Sklar’s theorem (Sklar 1959) states that G can be ex- pressed as G(y 1, ... , y L) 5 C[F1(y 1), FL(yL)], (6) where C is a copula that links an L-variate cumulative distribution function G to its univariate marginal cdf’s: F1, ... , FL. In Eq. (6), a joint distribution is represented as uni- variate margins plus copulas. The problems of estimat- ing univariate distributions and estimating dependence can therefore be treated separately. Univariate cali- bration marginal cdf’s F1, ... , FL are provided by the calibration step described in the previous section. The choice of the copula C depends on the application and on the size L of the multivariate problem. We focus here on empirical copulas since they are suitable for prob- lems with high dimensionality. An empirical copula is based on a multivariate de- pendence template, a speciﬁc discrete dataset z deﬁned in RL. The chosen dataset is described formally as z d f(z1 1, .. . , z N 1 ), ... ,(z 1 L, ... , z N L )g (7) consisting of L-tuples of size N with entries in R. In other words, L is the dimension of the multivariate variable and N is the number of scenarios. The rank of zn l for n 2f1, ... , Ng and l 2f1, ... , Lg is deﬁned as Rn l d \u0001 N i51 I(z i l # zn l ) , (8) where I(\u0002) denotes the indicator function taking a value of 1 if the condition in parentheses is true and 0 otherwise. In practice, N equidistant quantiles of Fl with l 2f1, ... , Lg are derived from the univariate calibra- tion step: q d f(q 1 1, ... , q N 1 ), ... ,(q 1 L, ... , q N L )g (9) with q n l d F 21 l (tn); n 2f1, .. . , Ng, (10) where tn is deﬁned in Eq. (3). The sample q is re- arranged following the dependence structure of the reference template z. The permutations pl(n)dRn l for n 2f1, ... , Ng are derived from the univariate ranks R1 l , ... , RN l for l 2f1, ... , Lg and applied to the uni- variate calibrated sample q. The postprocessed scenarios ~x 1 l , .. . , ~xN l for each margin l is expressed as ~x 1 l d qpl(1) l , ... , ~xN l › q pl(N) l . (11) The multivariate correlation structures are generated based on the rank correlation structures of a sample template z. The empirical copulas presented here only differ in the way z is deﬁned. In the following, let t 2 f1, ... , Tg be a lead time and let L › T. For simplicity, we consider here a single weather variable and a single location. a. Ensemble copula coupling The rank structure of the ensemble is preserved after calibration when applying the standard ECC approach. The raw ensemble forecast is denoted x: x d f(x 1 1, ... , x Ne 1 ), ... ,(x 1 L, ... , x Ne L )g, (12) where Ne is the ensemble size. ECC applies without restriction to any multivariate setting. The number of scenarios generated with ECC is however the same as the size of the original ensemble (N 5 Ne). The transfer of the rank structure from the raw ensemble forecast to the calibrated one consists then of taking x as the re- quired template in Eq. (7). Based on COSMO-DE-EPS forecasts in Fig. 3a (identical to Fig. 2a), an example of scenarios derived with ECC is provided in Fig. 3b. The increase in spread after the calibration step implies a larger step-to-step variability in the time trajectories. Figure 4 focuses on a single scenario highlighting the difference between the original and postprocessed scenarios. b. Dual-ensemble copula coupling ECC assumes that the ensemble prediction system correctly describes the spatiotemporal dependence structures of the weather variable. This assumption is quite strong and cannot be valid in all cases. On the other hand, based on the assumption of error statio- narity, parametric methods have been developed that 4740 M O NTH L Y W EA TH ER REV I EW VOLUME 144 Unauthenticated | Downloaded 01/27/25 02:52 AM UTC focus on the covariance structures of the forecast error (Pinson et al. 2009; Schölzel and Hense 2011). We propose a new version of the ECC approach, which is an attempt to combine both types of information: the structure of the original ensemble and the error auto- correlation estimated from past data. Therefore, the new scheme is called dual-ensemble copula coupling, as the copula relies on a dual source of information. For this purpose, we denote e the forecast error de- ﬁned as the difference between ensemble mean fore- casts and observations: e d fe 1, ... , eT g and (13) 5fy1 2 m(x1), ... , yT 2 m(x T )g, (14) where m(xt) and yt are the ensemble mean and the corresponding observation at lead time t 2f1, ... , Tg, respectively. The temporal correlation of the error is described by a correlation matrix Re, deﬁned as Re 5 0 B B B B B @ re1,e1 re1,e2 ... re1,eT re2,e1 re2,e2 ... re2,eT .. . .. . ⋱ .. . reT ,e1 reT ,e2 ... reT ,eT 1 C C C C C A , (15) where ret1,et2 is the correlation coefﬁcient of the forecast error at lead times t1 and t2. The empirical correlation matrix ^Re is estimated based on the training samples used for the univariate calibration step at the different lead times. In our setup, ^Re is regularly updated on a daily basis from the moving windows of 45 days deﬁned as training datasets for the EMOS application. Again here, we aim to construct a template [Eq. (7)]in ordertoestablishthe correlationstructureswithinthe cali- brated ensemble: qdf(q 1 1, .. . , q Ne 1 ), .. . ,(q 1 T , .. . , q Ne T )g. In the d-ECC approach, the template is built by performing the following steps: 1) Apply ECC with the original ensemble forecast x as the reference sample template, in order to derive a postprocessed ensemble of scenarios ~x: ~x d f(~x1 1, ... , ~xNe 1 ), ... ,(~x1 T , ... , ~x Ne T )g. (16) 2) Derive the error correction ci imposed to each scenario i (i 2 1, ... , Ne) of the reference template by this postprocessing step: c i d fc i 1, ... , ci T g and (17) 5f~x i 1 2 xi 1, ... , ~xi T 2 xi T g. (18) 3) Transformation step: Apply a transformation to the correction ci of each scenario based on the estimate of the error autocorrelation ^Re and its eigendecom- position ^Re 5 ULU21 in order to derive the adjusted corrections ci: c ^i 5 ^R1/2 e ci and (19) 5UL 1/2U21ci . (20) 4) Derive the so-called adjusted ensemble x ^ : x ^ d f(x ^1 1, ... , x ^Ne 1 ), ... ,(x ^1 T , ... , x ^Ne T )g, (21) where a scenario x ^i 5 fx ^i 1, ... , x ^i T )g of x ^ is deﬁned as a combination of the original member and the adjusted error correction, namely, x ^i 5 xi 1 c ^i . (22) 5) Take x ^ as the reference template in Eq. (7) so that the new empirical copula is based on the adjusted ensemble. The d-ECC reference template x ^ combines the raw ensemble structure and the autocorrelation of the fore- cast error reﬂected in the adjusted member corrections.

DECEMBER 2016 B E N B OUALL È GUE ET AL. 4741 Unauthenticated | Downloaded 01/27/25 02:52 AM UTC The transformation of the scenario corrections in Eq. (20) adjusts their correlation structure based on the error cor- relation matrix ^Re. Taking the square root of the correla- tion matrix [Eq. (20)] resembles a signal processing technique, which is described as a coloring transformation of a vector of random variables (Kessy et al. 2015). 4. Illustration and discussion of d-ECC Focusing on a single member, the d-ECC steps are illustrated in Fig. 4. First, the correction associated with each ECC scenario with respect to the corresponding original ensemble member is computed [black line in Fig. 4b; Eq. (18)]. This scenario correction is adjusted based on the assumption of temporal autocorrelation of the error [dashed line in Fig. 4b; Eq. (20)]. This adjusted scenario correction is then superimposed onto the original ensemble forecast before the correlation struc- ture of the adjusted ensemble is drawn again. The new scheme reduces to the standard ECC in the case where rank(x i t) 5 rank(x ^i t) for all i 2f1, ... , Neg and t 2f1, ... , Tg, which means that the additional terms c ^i do not have any impact on the rank structure of the ensemble. This case occurs if the following condi- tions are met: d ^Re 5 I, where I is the identity matrix, which means that there is no temporal correlation of the error in the original ensemble; d c 5 0, where 0 is the null vector, which means that the calibration step does not impact the forecast, the forecast being already well calibrated; and d c 5 h 3 J, where h is a constant and J an all-ones vector, which means that the calibration step corrects only for bias errors and the system is spread-bias free. So the d-ECC typically takes effect if calibration cor- rects the spread and if this correction is correlated in time at the member level. Additional insight can be gained by looking at the following equations. Let the observation yt and the postprocessed ensemble members ~xi t be realizations of random variables Y and ~X. Consider the covariance of the forecast error denoted k and deﬁned as k t1,t2 d Ef[Yt1 2 m( ~X t1)][Yt2 2 m( ~X t2)]g, (23) where t1 and t2 are two lead times and E[\u0002] the expec- tation operator. It is assumed that the postprocessed ensemble mean m(~xt) is fully bias corrected so that E[Yt 2 m( ~X t)] 5 0. After postprocessing, the forecast scenarios and ob- servation time series are considered as drawn from the same multivariate probability distribution, so the fore- cast error covariance can also be expressed as kt1,t2 5 Ef[ ~X t1 2 m( ~X t1)][ ~X t2 2 m( ~X t2)]g (24) 5r~xt1,~xt2s~xt1s~xt2 , (25) where r~xt1,~xt2 refers to the correlation between ~xt1 and ~xt2, and s~xt refers to the square root of the variances be- tween the members of the calibrated ensemble (~x1, ... , ~x Ne ) at lead time t. The corresponding estima- tors are ^k t1,t2 5 1 N e 2 1 \u0001 Ne i51 f[~xi t1 2 m(~xt1)][~xi t2 2 m(~x t2)]g, (26) ^s~xt 5 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 N e 2 1 \u0001 Ne i51 [~x i t 2 m(~xt)]2 v u u t , (27) and FIG. 4.

(28) From Eq. (18) recall that ~x i t 5 xi t 1 ci t ; (29) so, we can rewrite the expression in Eq. (25) as r~xt1, ~xt2s~xt1s~xt2 5 rxt1,xt2sxt1sxt2 1 rct1,ct2sct1sct2 1 «, (30) where rxt1, xt2 is the error autocorrelation in the original ensemble, rct1,ct2 the autocorrelation of the corrections, and sxt and sct the standard deviation of the original ensemble and the standard deviation of the correction at lead time t, respectively. The term « corresponds to the estimated covariances of x and c, and can be considered to be negligible assuming that the original forecast and the corrections are drawn from two independent ran- dom processes. Furthermore, the stationarity assumption of d-ECC implies that the correlation r~xt1,~xt2 can also be estimated from past error statistics: r~xt1, ~xt2 5 E[^ret1,et2], (31) where the notation ^ret1,et2 refers to the elements of the estimated correlation matrix ^Re. The stationarity assumption takes effect in the transformation step of d-ECC [Eq. (20)], which modiﬁes the correlation of the scenario corrections rct1,ct2 and pushes it toward the estimated correlation ^ret1,et2. In other words, the transformation affects rct1,ct2sct1sct2 [second term in Eq. (30)]. We expect d-ECC to have a relevant im- pact if rct1,ct2sct1sct2 dominates the sum in Eq. (30). Typically, this is the case when the spread sxt of the original ensemble differs from the spread s~xt after calibration. To illustrate the impact of the transformation step on the correlation structure of the reference template, the scenario-generation techniques are applied to a basic synthetic dataset. For this purpose, we consider that observations and forecasts are drawn from bivariate normal distributions noted N (m, S), with m the mean vector and S the covariance matrix. The mean vector is set to a null vector, m 5 \u0003 0 0 \u0004, in all cases. The covariance matrix of the observation distribution is set to Sobs 5 \u0003 10:5 0:51 \u0004 , so the distribution has unit variances and a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.5 between the two dimensions. Using this setting results in target quantiles of the calibration process that correspond to the quantiles of the standard normal distribution. The covariance matrix of the fore- cast distribution is deﬁned as Sfct 5 \u0003 aba ba a \u0004 with a a spread parameter and b a correlation parameter that allow us to simulate deﬁciencies in spread and correlation of the synthetic ensemble forecasts. Post- processing using ECC and d-ECC is applied considering 50 ensemble members and a sample of 1000 cases. The impact of the multivariate postprocessing schemes is il- lustrated by plotting the correlation coefﬁcient between the two dimensions of the process for a range of a and b parameters (Fig. 5). The correlation coefﬁcient of the observation is maintained as a constant (0.5) and the correlation of the raw forecasts is modiﬁed by varying the parameter b from 0.1 to 0.9. The spread parameter a takes a value of 0.5 to simulate an underdispersive ensemble, 1 a calibrated ensemble, and 1.5 an over- dispersive ensemble. The correlation structure of the forecast is not modi- ﬁed by applying ECC, as illustrated by the gray dashed line while the gray line shows how the transformation step affects the correlation structure of the forecast: the correlation is increased when the ensemble is under- dispersed and decreased in cases of overdispersion. We ﬁnd that d-ECC appears to be appropriate in the cases of ensemble forecasts with the following combination of characteristics: underdispersion combined with a lack of autocorrelation or overdispersion combined with too strong autocorrelation in the time series. This investigation could certainly be extended consid- ering more complex idealized studies and developing a rigorous mathematical framework. This would be wel- comed as further research and would add additional ev- idence to the expected behavior of d-ECC. Furthermore, in the remainder of this paper, time series derived with d-ECC are compared to ECC-derived scenarios. A com- plementary study could aim to estimate the beneﬁts of the dual approach with respect to purely statistical methods that only account for error characteristics es- timated from historical data (Pinson et al. 2009; Möller et al. 2013). Another important aspect of d-ECC is the estimation of the correlation matrix ^Re. By means of this matrix, the DECEMBER 2016 B E N B OUALL È GUE ET AL. 4743 Unauthenticated | Downloaded 01/27/25 02:52 AM UTC assumption of error autocorrelation is checked and adjusted. The matrix is estimated from the training datasets used for calibration at the different lead times. Based on the dataset described in section 2, Fig. 6 shows the lagged correlation of the forecast error derived from ^Re. The correlation is decreasing as a function of the time lag, reaching near-zero values for lags greater than 10 h. However, for short and very short time lags, the correlation is high and stable over the rolling training datasets. In particular, focusing on a time lag of 1 h, the correlation ranges between 60% and 80%. The corre- lation variability shown in Fig. 6 is estimated over a 3-month period. Similar results are obtained when checking the variability of the correlation within each training dataset (not shown). The exhibited low vari- ability indicates that the temporal correlation of the forecast error is not ﬂow dependent. As a consequence, d-ECC can be seen as a ‘‘universal’’ approach that does not suffer restriction related to the forecasted weather situation. Considering again our case study, the scenarios gen- erated with d-ECC based on the COSMO-DE-EPS forecasts are shown in Fig. 3c. The d-ECC-derived sce- narios are smoother and subjectively more realistic than the ones derived with ECC in Fig. 3b.In Fig. 4, focusing on a single scenario, it is highlighted that the difference between the original and the d-ECC time trajectories varies gradually from one time interval to the next, while abrupt transitions occur in the case of the ECC scenario, as in this example between hours 15 and 17. Note that d-ECC does not give the same result as would a simple smoothing of the calibrated scenarios ~x. Smoothing in time would modify the values q of the calibrated ensemble and possibly diminish its reliability. Instead, d-ECC affects the time variability of the scenarios by constructing a template [Eq. (7)] based on x ^ [Eq. (22)] while preserving the calibrated values q. 5. Veriﬁcation methods a. Multivariate scores Veriﬁcation of scenarios is ﬁrst performed by assess- ing the multivariate aspects of the forecast by means of adequate scores. The scores are applied with a focus on FIG. 5. Correlation coefﬁcients between the two dimensions of the synthetic bivariate datasets as a function of the correlation parameter b with the spread parameter a 5 (a) 0.5, (b) 1, and (c) 1.5.

Considering an ensemble with Ne scenarios x (n) with n 2f1, ... , Neg and an observed scenario y, the energy score (ES; Gneiting et al. 2008) is deﬁned as ES 5 1 N e \u0001 Ne n51 ky 2 x(n)k2 1 2N2 e \u0001 Ne m51 \u0001 Ne p51 kx(m)2 x(p)k, (32) where jj\u0002jj represents the Euclidean norm. ES is a gen- eralization of the CRPS to the multivariate case. Th eES suffers from a lack of sensitivity to mis- representation of correlation structures (Pinson and Tastu 2013). We consider therefore additionally the p-variogram score (pVS; Scheuerer and Hamill 2015), which has better discriminative properties in this re- spect. Based on the geostatistical concept of variogram, pVS is deﬁned as pVS 5 \u0001 i6¼j vij \" jy i 2 y jjp 2 1 Ne \u0001 Ne n51 jx (n) i 2 x (n) j j p#2 (33) with p the order of the variogram and where vij are weights and the indices i and j indicate the ith and the jth components of the marked vectors, respectively. To focus on rapid changes in wind speed, the weights vij are chosen proportional to the inverse square distance in time such that v ij 5 1 (i 2 j) 2, i 6¼ j , (34) since i and j are here forecast lead-time indices. b. Multivariate rank histograms The multivariate aspect of the forecast is in a second step assessed by means of rank histograms applied to multidimensional ﬁelds (Thorarinsdottir et al. 2016). Two variants of the multivariate rank histogram are applied: the averaged rank histogram (ARH) and the band depth rank histogram (BDRH). The difference between the two approaches lies in the way they dis- tinguish pre-ranks from multivariate forecasts. ARH considers the averaged rank over the multivariate aspect while BDRH assesses the centrality of the observation within the ensemble based on the concept of functional band depth. The interpretation of ARH is the same as the in- terpretation of a univariate rank histogram: <-shaped, \\-shaped and ﬂat rank histograms are interpreted as un- derdispersion, overdispersion, and calibration of the underlying ensemble forecasts, respectively. The inter- pretation of BDRH is different: a < shape is associated with a lack of correlation, an \\ shape to a too high correlation in the ensemble, a skewed rank histogram to bias or dispersion errors and a ﬂat rank histogram to calibrated forecasts. c. Product-oriented veriﬁcation In addition to multivariate veriﬁcation of time series scenarios, the forecasts are assessed within a product- oriented framework. This type of scenario veriﬁcation follows the spirit of the event-oriented veriﬁcation framework proposed by Pinson and Girard (2012). Probabilistic forecasts that require time trajectories are provided and assessed by means of well-established univariate probabilistic scores. Two types of products derived from forecasted sce- narios are examined here. The ﬁrst one is deﬁned as the mean wind speed over a day (here, a day is limited to the 21-h forecast horizon). The second product is deﬁned as the maximal upward wind ramp over a day, a wind ramp being deﬁned as the difference between two consecutive forecast intervals. For both products, 20 forecasts are derived from the 20 scenarios at each station and each veriﬁcation day. The performances of the ensemble forecasts for the two types of products are evaluated by means of the CRPS. The CRPS is the generalization of the mean absolute error to predictive distributions (Gneiting et al. 2008), and can be seen as the integral of the Brier score (BS; Brier 1950) over all thresholds or the integral of the quantile score (QS; Koenker and Bassett 1978) over all probability levels. Considering an ensemble forecast, the CRPS can be calculated as a weighted sum of QS applied to the sorted en- semble members (Bröcker 2012). For more insight into forecast performance in terms of attributes, the CRPS is decomposed following the same approach (Ben Bouallègue 2015): the CRPS reliability and resolution components are calculated as weighted sums of the reliability and resolution components of the QS at the probability levels deﬁned by the en- semble size [see Eq. (3)], respectively. Formally, we write CRPSreliability 5 2 Ne \u0001 Ne n51 QS (tn) reliability and (35) CRPSresolution 5 2 Ne \u0001 Ne n51 QS (tn) resolution , (36) where QS (tn) reliability and QS(tn) resolution are the reliability and resolution components, respectively, of the QS applied to the quantile forecasts at probability level tn. The QS decomposition is performed following Bentzien and DECEMBER 2016 B E N B OUALL È GUE ET AL. 4745 Unauthenticated | Downloaded 01/27/25 02:52 AM UTC Friederichs (2014). The CRPSreliability is negatively ori- ented (the lower the better) while the CRPSresolution is positively oriented (the higher the better). d. Bootstrapping The statistical signiﬁcance of the results is tested by applying a block-bootstrap approach. Bootstrapping is a resampling technique that provides an estimation of the statistical consistency and is commonly applied to me- teorological datasets (Efron and Tibshirani 1986). A block-bootstrap approach is applied in the follow- ing, which consists of deﬁning a block as a single day during the veriﬁcation period (Hamill 1999). Each day is considered to be a separate block of fully independent data. The veriﬁcation process is repeated 500 times by using each time a random sample with replacement of the 92 veriﬁcation days (March–May 2013). The derived score distributions illustrate consequently the variability of the performance measures over the veriﬁcation pe- riod and not between locations. Boxplots are used to represent the distributions of the performance measures, where the quantile of the distributions at probability levels of 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% are highlighted. 6. Results and discussion Before applying the veriﬁcation methods introduced in the previous section, we propose to explore statisti- cally the COSMO-DE-EPS time series variability by means of a spectral analysis, an analysis of the time se- ries in the frequency domain. Such an analysis is useful in order to describe the statistical properties of the scenarios but also has direct implications for user’s ap- plications (see below; Vincent et al. 2010). A Fourier transformation is applied to each forecasted and ob- served scenario and the contributions of the oscillations at various frequencies to the scenario variance are ex- amined (Wilks 2006). In Fig. 7, the mean amplitude of the forecast and observation time series over all stations and veriﬁcation days is plotted as a function of their frequency components. As has already been suggested by the case study, this analysis conﬁrms that the ECC considerably increases the variability of the time trajectories with respect to the original ensemble, in particular at high frequencies. The ECC scenario ﬂuctuations are also much larger than the observed ones. Indeed, the amplitude is on average about 2 times larger at high frequencies in ECC time series than in the observed results, which explains the visual impression that ECC scenarios are unrealistic. Conversely, scenarios derived with the new copula approach do not exhibit such features. While the original ensemble shows a deﬁcit of variability with respect to the observations, the d-ECC approach al- lows for improving this aspect of the forecast. This ﬁrst result, showing that d-ECC scenarios have a mean spectrum similar to that of the observations, is com- plemented with an objective assessment of the fore- casted scenarios based on probabilistic veriﬁcation measures. Figure 8 shows the performance of the forecasted time trajectories by means of multivariate scores. The postprocessed scenarios perform signiﬁcantly better than the raw members in terms of ES (Fig. 8a). In terms of pVS, the d-ECC scenarios are better than the ECC ones and signiﬁcantly better than the raw ones when p 5 0.5 (Fig. 8b). Forhigherordersofthe variogram (here p 5 1; Fig. 8c), the forecast improvement after postprocessing is still clear when using d-ECC while the ECC results are slightly worse than those of the original forecasts. Figure 9 depicts the results in terms of multivariate rank histograms for ARH (top panel) and BDRH (bottom panel). The raw ensemble shows clear re- liability deﬁciencies (Figs. 9a,d), which motivated the use of postprocessing techniques. Forecasts derived with ECC continue to show underdispersiveness but also too little correlation (Figs. 9b,e) while forecasts derived with d-ECC are better calibrated according to the rank his- tograms in Figs. 9c,f. Indeed, both plots indicate good reliability among the d-ECC-derived scenarios. FIG. 7. Spectral analysis of the scenarios from the raw ensemble (black lines) of the scenarios derived with ECC (dashed gray lines) and with d-ECC (gray lines). Each line corresponds to 1 scenario among the 20. The spectrum of the observed time series is repre- sented by the dashed line with clear circles. 4746 M O NTH L Y W EA TH ER REV I EW VOLUME 144 Unauthenticated | Downloaded 01/27/25 02:52 AM UTC Figure 10 focuses on two products drawn from the time series forecasts: the daily mean wind speed (top panel) and the daily maximal upward ramp (bottom panel). The performance are assessed in terms of CRPS, CRPS reliability, and CRPS resolution, from left to right, respectively. Looking at the results in terms of CRPS, we note the high degree of similarity between Figs. 10a and 10d and Figs. 8a and 8c. As for the ES, postprocessing signiﬁcantly improves the forecasts of the daily mean product. As for pVS with p 5 1, d-ECC improves the ramp product with respect to the original while ECC does not generate improved products. The CRPS decomposition allows us to provide detail related to the origin of these performance improvements. We see in Figs. 10b,e that the CRPS results are mainly ex- plained by the impact of the postprocessing on the CRPS reliability components. However, focusing on the results in terms of CRPS resolution in Figs. 10c,f,we note that the resolution of the original and d-ECC products are comparable while ECC deteriorates the resolution of the ramp product with respect to the original. These veriﬁcation results are interpreted as follows. Calibration corrects for the mean of the ensemble forecast and this is reﬂected, after the derivation of scenarios, by an improvement in the ES and daily mean product skill. Calibration also corrects for spread de- ﬁciencies increasing the variability of the ensemble forecasts. This increase in spread associated with the preservation of the rank structure of the original ensemble, as is the case with the ECC approach, enlarges indiscriminately the tem- poral variability of the forecasts and leads to a slight de- terioration of the pVS and ramp product results. The d-ECC approach provides scenarios with a temporal variability comparable to that of the observations. In that case, the beneﬁt of the calibration step in terms of reliability (at single forecast lead times) persists at the multivariate level (looking at time trajectories) after the reconstruction of scenarios with d-ECC. The multivariate reliability, or the FIG. 8.

Moreover, d-ECC scenarios perform as well as the original ensemble forecast in terms of resolution. So, unlike ECC, d-ECC is able to generate reliable scenarios with a level of resolution that does not deteriorate with respect to the original ensemble forecasts. 7. Conclusions and outlook A new empirical copula approach is proposed for the postprocessing of calibrated ensemble forecasts. The so-called dual-ensemble copula coupling approach is in- troduced with a focus on temporal structures of wind fore- casts. The new scheme includes a temporal component in the ECC approach accounting for the error autocorrelation of the ensemble members. The estimation of the correlation structure in the error based on past data allows for adjusting the dependence structure in the original ensemble. Based on COSMO-DE-EPS forecasts, the scenarios derived with d-ECC prove to be qualitatively realistic and quantitatively of superior quality. Postprocessing of wind speed combining EMOS and d-ECC improves the forecasts in many aspects. In comparison to ECC, d-ECC drastically improves the quality of the derived scenarios. Applications that require temporal trajecto- ries will fully beneﬁt from the new approach in that case. As for any postprocessing technique, the beneﬁt of the new copula approach can be weakened by improving the representation of the forecast uncertainty with more efﬁcient member generation techniques and/or by im- proving the calibration procedure correcting for conditional biases. Meanwhile, with its low additional complexity and computational costs, d-ECC can be considered to be a valuable alternative to the standard ECC for the generation of consistent scenarios from COSMO-DE-EPS. Though only the temporal aspects have been inves- tigated in this study, the dual-ensemble copula ap- proach could be generalized to any multivariate setting. Further research is however required for the application of d-ECC at scales that are unresolved by the observations. For example, geostatistical tools could be applied for the description of the autocorre- lation error structure at the model grid level. More- over, the mathematical interpretation of the d-ECC scheme developed here would beneﬁt from further theoretical investigation. Acknowledgments.
