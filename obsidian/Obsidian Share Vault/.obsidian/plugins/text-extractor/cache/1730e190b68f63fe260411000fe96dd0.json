In this paper, a multi-feature based approach with the incorporation of variable thresholds is developed to detect electricity price spikes in the national electricity market of Australia. The variable thresholds, which are determined using a weighted sliding window average and an adjusted standard deviation, help to segregate spikes from normal price variations. Also, signiﬁcant features are extracted from the market after thoroughly analyzing the underlying causes resulting into the price spikes. These features are employed as inputs to a support vector machine to classify electricity prices as spikes or non-spikes. A case study is conducted using a dataset acquired from the state of New South Wales, Australia. The results show that the proposed method can successfully detect the price spikes with high accuracy and conﬁdence.

INTRODUCTION With the deregulation of electricity markets, electricity prices exhibit extreme volatility with the presence of high abnor- mal variations including unexpected and abrupt price spikes. These price spikes create extraordinary uncertainty in mar- ket conditions [1]. Moreover, price spikes can have strong impacts on the market operation and demand management strategies [2], [3]. Therefore, detecting price spikes is essen- tial in an electricity market mainly to reduce the risks for market participants and stimulate the market investment. Fur- thermore, decision making by market players can signiﬁ- cantly be enhanced with the incorporation of an effective spike detection model [4]. Also, it is noted that the spikes have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on electricity price forecasting [5], [6]; thus, a reliable spike separation can help in improving the performance of price forecasting model effectively. Although there are numerous research studies on electric- ity price forecasting [7], limited work has been reported in The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Ayaz Ahmad . the area of the price spike prediction. In [8], a price spike is considered to occur if the normal price forecasting sur- passes a given threshold. Although this is a simple and naïve method to identify spikes, it may not be reliable as spikes are removed from the training dataset; as a consequence, the model could not capture the intrinsic trends of the spike occurrence. In order to tackle this limitation, separate models should be built for spike detection. In [9], a price spike is detected using probability classiﬁer developed based on naïve Bayesian classier (NBC). This model allows the classifying probability threshold to change independently from the prob- ability of normal price thus avoiding the imbalance related to the spike dataset. In [10], extreme learning machine is used to detect spikes because such a model could speed up the initial convergence process by randomly choosing the input weights and provide the sufﬁcient generalization perfor- mance at extremely fast learning speed. Authors in [11] have stated that NBC and random forest classiﬁer can detect spikes with high accuracy; while the authors in [12] have reported that a copula-based model can be used to effectively detect spikes. In order to leverage different classifying models, 13960 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Vu et al.: Multi-Feature Based Approach Incorporating Variable Thresholds for Detecting Price Spikes the authors in [13] have employed a compound classiﬁer by combining three individual models, which are relevance vec- tor machine, bagged decision trees and probabilistic neural network. However, the combination may increase the model complexity and computational burden thereby decreasing the efﬁciency of the model utilization. In the literature, support vector machine (SVM) has been reported as a robust and effective classiﬁer for the spike detection. This classiﬁer could provide the detection result with high conﬁdence [14] thereby enhancing the reliability of the detection model. SVM has been used successfully for various aspects of power sys- tem analysis with promising results [15], [16]. Consequently, SVM is employed in this paper as a base model to develop the advanced spike detection technique. In the spike detection, spike threshold selection is crucial because it separates spikes from the normal price dataset. It is noted from all the above-mentioned models that a ﬁxed threshold, was used to separate spikes from normal price data. While this separation is simple and handy, it may not be appropriate since different values of ﬁxed thresh- old, as reported in [17], result in vast variations in the accuracy of the spike detection model. To tackle this lim- itation, the authors in [18] and [19] considered different ranges (i.e., low, medium, and high) of prices for separation processes. This separation may not be effective because of the indistinct features between two consecutive price lev- els. Also, such a separation could not capture the seasonal variations in price. Noticing the seasonal property of price, the authors in [14] employed three distinct thresholds for three main seasons in a year to ensure effective spike sep- aration. However, this separation may not be sufﬁcient in capturing the alteration of price in a monthly or weekly resolution. In the proposed research study, a new variable threshold, which is based on a weighted sliding window average and an adjusted standard deviation of price, is introduced to create a robust training dataset for spike detection and separate the spikes from normal price dataset. Subsequently, a multi- feature based spike detection model is developed to detect price spikes. The features are extracted from signiﬁcant attributes in the national electricity market (NEM) of Aus- tralia, and their individual signiﬁcance levels are evaluated using the Fisher score. The extracted features are then used as inputs to a SVM to classify the price event as spikes or non- spikes. A case study is carried out with the aid of a dataset acquired for the State of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The results show that the proposed model has an ability to detect price spikes with very high accuracy and conﬁdence. The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces a new variable threshold for spike separation after investi- gating the variation of electricity price. Section III presents the development of a multi-feature based spike detection model using feature extraction and classiﬁcation techniques. Section IV highlights some relevant results and discussions related to a case study. The concluding remarks are included in Section V. FIGURE 1. Variation of electricity price in NSW, Australia (a) Data for entire year of 2015, (b) An expanded view of price variation in Jan 2015. II. ELECTRICITY PRICE SPIKES AND VARIABLE THRESHOLD A. ELECTRICITY PRICE SPIKES In a deregulated electricity market, electricity price is deter- mined based on the bidding actions of market participants under the management of an independent system opera- tor (ISO) with different market rules. For example, in Aus- tralia, the Australian energy market operator (AEMO) is responsible for managing the operation of NEM. Under NEM, different types of prices, such as dispatch price and wholesale price, are determined for each region (state) based on the bidding submission of the market participants. While dispatch price is based on real time bidding of the market participant in every 5 minutes, wholesale price (i.e., spot price or settlement price) is the average of 6 dispatch prices in every 30 minutes. The wholesale price is the base for cal- culating payment or estimating transaction between supplier and consumer in the NEM. In the proposed research study, the wholesale price is employed for further analysis. As a part of the market operation, the dispatch price is lim- ited by some rules such as market price cap, market ﬂoor price and administered price. While price cap and ﬂoor price are the maximum and minimum prices in the normal operation of the market respectively, administered price is applied to all dispatch intervals during the administered price period only. This period is decided when the accumulated price exceeds a threshold which is deﬁned by AEMO [36] for each region in Australia and subjected to change for a speciﬁc period. The presence of these price constraints in conjunction with the bidding action in the electricity market [20] result in extreme volatility of an electricity price. The overview of an electricity price for NSW, Australia for year 2015 is given in Fig. 1 (a). It can be seen from Fig. 1(a) that the price has low range with some seldom, random high jumps. The highest jump is near to the price cap value of $14,000/MWh in September 2015. VOLUME 9, 2021 13961 D. H. Vu et al.: Multi-Feature Based Approach Incorporating Variable Thresholds for Detecting Price Spikes TABLE 1. Properties of electricity price from NSW, Australia in 2015. There are 3 other peaks (of about $2,000/MWh), of which 2 are in November 2015 and the other is in early May 2015. Except these extremely high jumps, the price signal remains at a low level. Fig. 1(b) is an expanded view showcasing the variability of price data more closely for January 2015. The properties of electricity price for year 2015 are deter- mined and given in Table 1. Although mean value of price is very low, at about $39/MWh, the maximum value is more than $13,000/MWh (i.e., more than 300 times the mean value). This leads to a standard deviation of $119.73/MWh. Also, it is revealed from Table 1 that the minimum price can be at a negative level. There are only two negative price incidents in 2015 (in May and December), which are probably due to the redundancy of renewable power at a speciﬁc time, and the coal generation had bid the price negatively to avoid shutting down the power plants, which is associated with the high cost in operation. Such a consideration of negative prices is out of the scope of this paper. B. VARIABLE THRESHOLD FOR PRICE SPIKES Although electricity price may encounter different abnor- mal variations such as high jump, high value and negative price [14], only high value is considered while analyzing spikes in the proposed research study. It is found in the litera- ture that spike treatment should be considered simultaneously with seasonal variations in price [21], [22]. To address the seasonal variation in price, the authors of [21] have employed different techniques such as recursive ﬁlter, moving average ﬁlter using mean prices or median prices, and wavelet or low pass ﬁltering, for spikes separation. These techniques are investigated for different dataset in [22], and it is shown that the number of spikes might change signiﬁcantly when different thresholds are used. While these techniques can reveal spikes’ patterns and eliminate the spikes from price dataset effectively, the effort is limited to the investigation of historical data only. In the proposed research study, a variable threshold is introduced to separate the spikes from price data. The variable threshold is based on a weighted sliding window average and an adjusted standard deviation. An adjusted standard deviation instead of the standard deviation is used in this study because the use of standard deviation of price data may cause ambiguity. While most authors in the literature use a threshold as a sum of mean and two times the standard deviation, the authors in [23] considered only one standard deviation because the standard deviation is extremely high for the section of a data used in [22]. This illustrates that the standard deviation may not be representative for a price dataset, but it is strongly inﬂuenced by the appearance of an extremely high spike within the studied dataset. For a demonstration, it can be seen from Table 1 that the mean value of data sample is $39.16/MWh, but the standard deviation is $119.73/MWh. However, it can also be observed from the data sample that almost all (99.95%) of the price data for 2015 is in the range of [0, 300]. The high standard deviation in this case does not represent the majority of data sample, but is distorted by few extremely high prices. Consequently, a new adjusted standard deviation should be estimated for further robust spike threshold determination. It is reasonable to estimate the adjusted standard deviation by considering the price data in the majority population of the dataset, or adjusted dataset. This adjusted dataset can be derived by introducing speciﬁc constraints on the original dataset using a ﬁlter. More speciﬁcally, the adjusted price yi derived from the original price xi with the constraints presented as follows: yi =    Min if xi < Min xi if Min ≤ xi ≤ Max Max if Max < xi (1) where, Min and Max are the minimum and maximum values of majority population, respectively. In case of price dataset from NSW, Australia in year 2015, Min and Max values can be considered to be $0/MWh and $300/MWh respectively. The calculation of the standard deviation of the adjusted dataset is given as follows: SN = √ √ √ √ 1 N N∑ i=1 (yi − ¯y) 2 (2) where, ¯y = 1 N ∑N i=1 yi is the mean value and SN is standard deviation of the data sample {yi, i = 1 : N }. The next step is to estimate the expectation of the price at a speciﬁc time, so the spike threshold can be determined using this expectation and the above discussed adjusted standard deviation. Given a time series (i.e., price data) Y , the expec- tation of price value Oi at a given time ti, can be determined as follows: Oi = E (y(ti)) = m (ti) + ei, E (e) = 0 (3) The estimation of expectation m(t i) can be represented using a kernel regression technique. For example, it can be determined following Nadaraya–Watson formula [24], which is based on a kernel of independent variables ti as follows: ˆm (ti) = ∑m j=1 ( K (tj, ti) × yi) ∑m j=1 K (tj, ti) (4) where, K (tj, ti) is a kernel function, dependent on the distance between tj and ti. It is noted that the kernel function does not need to sum up to 1. From the calculation perspective, the weights of each historical value yj can be determined as follows: wj = K (tj, ti) ∑m j=1 K (tj, ti) (5) 13962 VOLUME 9, 2021 D. H. Vu et al.: Multi-Feature Based Approach Incorporating Variable Thresholds for Detecting Price Spikes From (3), (4), and (5), the expectation of value y(t i) at time ti can be estimated as follows: ˆOi = m∑ j=1 ( wj × yj) (6) It is noted that the kernel function used in (4), which follows the deﬁnition of Nadaraya–Watson, can be extended into different kernel function depending on the purpose of speciﬁc studies. For example, if the aim of estimation is to calculate the weighted sliding window average value of y(t i) from a range { tj, j ∈ [i − h, i + h] } , the kernel can be set as follows: K ( tj, ti) = { 1 if (i − h ≤ j ≤ i + h) 0 otherwise (7) This sliding window in conjunction with the adjusted stan- dard deviation is used to determine the variable threshold for spike separation. The variable threshold at a point ti in a data sample N is estimated as follows: Ti = ˆOi + k × SN (8) where, k is the ratio deciding the distance between the expected value of price and the spike threshold. It is noted that the value of k can be found using grid search technique with an objective function being the performance of the detection model. In this research study, k = 3 is selected. It is worth noting that the variable threshold is ﬂexible, and it has ability to represent the ﬁxed threshold if the expectation ˆOi is set to the mean of sample price data. III. MULTI-FEATURE BASED SPIKE DETECTION This section presents the development of a multi-feature based spike detection model. The features are extracted from the data of the electricity market. The signiﬁcances of selected features are measured using Fisher scores. The extracted features are then inputted to a SVM model for predicting spikes. A. FEATURES’ EXTRACTION Features’ extraction helps reveal and select the signiﬁcant features, which can be incorporated into the spike detection process. The signiﬁcant features can be revealed by analyzing the underlying causes of spikes. In the literature, numerous research studies have discussed the reasons behind spike incidents. Price spikes can occur if the market encounters unexpected high demand in short term period. In this period, available generation may not match the demand [25], or the response from traditional fossil fuel based generators may not be sufﬁcient to provide additional generation [26]; consequently, energy sources with extremely high marginal cost have to be deployed to fulﬁl the mismatch. In addition, the uncertainty associated with various generating resources such as water level in case of a hydro generation [27] or intermittency of renewable sources including wind generation [28] may be the key factors which can trigger price spike events in an electricity market. Fur- thermore, the authors of [29] have reported that distribution TABLE 2. Potential reasons for price spikes in an electricity market. system outages can result in price spikes. Similarly, authors in [12] have highlighted that some severe weather condi- tions such as drought and ﬂood can be strongly correlated with severe and high density price spikes in an electricity market possibly due to non-availability of centralized gen- eration. It is also worth noting that human behavior such as gaming strategy from suppliers [30], [31] or error by an ISO [32] may contribute signiﬁcantly to spike occurrence. The abnormal conditions of the system which may cause abnormal variations in price including spikes are summarized in Table 2. It is noted that the individual causes, which are listed in Table 2, can occur coincidently. This coincidence can be represented by deriving a conjunction of the related fea- tures. For example, the coincidence between low available generation and high demand may create high possibility of spike occurrence with a degree of severity, and therefore the available generation and the electricity demand are two potential features. To represent the relationship between these two features, reserve generation (or surplus generation) can be used as another feature to identify the price spikes. In addi- tion, the interconnected electricity networks in south-east Australia rely heavily on interconnectors between different states in critical situations. As a result, the local price may be greatly inﬂuenced by the power shared between neighboring states. Since the electrical transmission system of NSW is interconnected with the transmission networks of Queens- land (QLD) and Victoria (VIC), the power transfer over these interconnectors can be considered as potential features in VOLUME 9, 2021 13963 D. H. Vu et al.: Multi-Feature Based Approach Incorporating Variable Thresholds for Detecting Price Spikes examining the price spikes. Furthermore, it is also noted from the practical dataset that spikes tend to occur more in day time rather than night time; also during weekday the probability of spikes are higher than during a weekend [14]. Consequently, time information such as hour and day of the incident can provide signiﬁcant description for a price spike. Authors in [37] have developed a short-term forecasting strategy for electricity spot prices containing random spikes. In order to evaluate the signiﬁcance level of each feature, for detecting the price spikes in this study, the Fisher crite- rion [33] is employed. Fisher measure is based on the distance between the means of the two classes and its variance within each class. The key idea of Fisher score is to ﬁnd a subset of features, such that in the data space spanned by the selected features, the distances between data points in different classes are as large as possible, while the distances between data points in the same class are as small as possible [33]. The features with higher Fisher score are more signiﬁcant in the detection process. The Fisher score is calculated as follows: F (c1, c2) = (m1 − m2) 2 s2 1 + s2 2 (9) where, m1 and m2 represent the mean, and s2 1 and s2 2 represent the variance of the two classes c1 and c2 respectively. B. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE Support vector machine (SVM) is applied to classify two groups of price data involving spikes and non-spikes. It is brieﬂy discussed as below. Given a dataset S = {(x1, y1) , (x2, y2) , . . . , (xn, yn)}, where {xi, i = 1 : n} represents a real valued p-dimensional input or feature vector (xi ∈ R p); and yi = {−1, +1} is a label indicating the class of xi. The main objective of SVM is to separate these two classes of features by introducing a decision boundary hyperplane determined by an orthogonal weight vector w and a bias b. The representation of the hyperplane is given as follows: f (x) = w T x + b (10) The class of input feature vector x can be determined using the sign function sgn (f (x)). The hyperplane param- eters which are weight vector w and the bias term b can be derived by solving the following problem: minimize { 1 2 ∥w∥2} subject to {yi(wT xi + b) ≥ 1 } , fori = 1, 2, . . . n (11) In order to deal with linearly non-separable training sets, soft-margin SVMs are considered. In soft margin SVMs, the weight vector w and the bias term b are determined by solving the following problem [34]: minimize { 1 2 ∥w∥ 2 + C n∑ i=1 ξi } subject to { yi ( wT xi + b ) ≥ 1 − ξi ξi ≥ 0 } , fori = 1, 2, . . . n (12) where, ξi is a slack variable measuring the distance between the margin and the training samples lying on the wrong side of the margin, and C is called the regularization parameter, which determines the trade-off between the maximization of the margin and the minimization of the classiﬁcation error. In order to solve the constrained quadratic programing problem presented above, Lagrange multiplier λi ≥ 0 and γi ≥ 0 are introduced. Hence, the Lagrange functional can be shown as follows [34]: L (w, b, ξ, λ, γ ) = 1 2 ∥w∥ 2 + C n∑ i=1 ξi − n∑ i=1 λi {yi ( w T xi + b ) − 1 + ξi} − n∑ i=1 γiξi (13) The above Lagrange function can be solved by introducing the dual formulation of the problem which is as follows [34]: minimize    n∑ i=1 λi − 1 2 n∑ i=1 n∑ j=1 λiλjyiyjx T i xj    subject to { ∑n i=1 λiyi = 0 C ≥ λi ≥ 0 } , fori = 1, 2, . . . n (14) The solution of the dual problem yields w as follows: w = n∑ i=1 λiyixi (15) The w has an expansion in terms of a subset of the training data where the Lagrange multipliers λi ̸= 0. Those training also satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition: λi {yi (w T xi + b) − 1 + ξi} = 0, for i = 1, 2, . . . n (16) From (16), the training vectors corresponding to nonzero Lagrange multipliers are needed to describe the hyperplane, and these training vectors are speciﬁed as support vectors. Hence, the decision boundary f (x) is determined by the sup- port vectors as follows: f (x) = ∑ λi>0 λiyix T i x + b (17) where, x is the input test vector, xT i x is the inner product, b is the bias term, and the condition λi > 0 allows only the support vectors of the dataset. For nonlinear classes, the original input space is mapped into a high-dimensional dot product space, known as feature space [35]. To avoid the cumbersome task of visiting the high- dimensional feature space, a kernel function is applied. Sub- stituting for the inner product of xT i x in the above equation by a kernel function K (xi, xj), a similar type of dual formulation problem can be obtained. Upon solving the optimization problem, we obtain the decision function as follows: f (x) = ∑ λi>0 λiyiK (xi, x) + b (18) 13964 VOLUME 9, 2021 D. H. Vu et al.: Multi-Feature Based Approach Incorporating Variable Thresholds for Detecting Price Spikes FIGURE 2. Conceptual diagram to detect spike. In this paper, the two popular kernels which are radial basis function (RBF) kernel (i.e., K (x, y) = exp ( −(|x-y|2)/2σ 2) ) and polynomial kernel (i.e., K (x, y) = ( xT y + 1)p), are employed for spike detection process, and the results are used for further investigation. C. SPIKE DETECTION PROCESS The conceptual diagram of spike detection process is pre- sented in Fig. 2. The process includes training and testing phases. In the training phase, the available price data are used to determine the spike threshold for separating spikes from normal price, and signiﬁcant features are extracted from the available features. The obtained spike and non-spike data are then used in conjunction with the extracted signiﬁcant features to tune the parameters of an SVM classiﬁer. The training process results in a trained SVM classiﬁer, which is used to forecast spikes in the testing phase. In the testing phase, when the data of the signiﬁcant fea- tures are given or updated, the trained classiﬁer is employed to detect a price spike. The output of the classiﬁer will indicate the class of the given inputs as a normal price or a spike. IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS A case study based on a dataset acquired from NSW, Australia is reported in this section. The spike threshold is derived and the signiﬁcant features are selected. Also, the results from the proposed detection model are presented in detail. A. CASE STUDY DATASET AND SPIKE THRESHHOLDS An electricity price dataset for NSW, Australia, acquired from AEMO [36], for a period between October 2014 to December 2015 with a resolution of 30 minutes is used to validate the proposed model. From this dataset, the ﬁxed and variable thresholds are determined for separating price spikes. An overview of the price dataset and the two thresholds are plotted in Fig. 3(a). It can be seen that the variable threshold is more ﬂexible than the ﬁxed threshold as it can adapt to the change of price over time. The difference between two thresh- olds results in different numbers of spikes separated from the same dataset. An expanded view of the dataset for speciﬁed time periods is given in Figs. 3(b), and 3(c) highlighting the FIGURE 3. Comparison of fixed and variable thresholds in spike separation (a) Oct 2014– Dec 2015, (b) 14th-18th May 2015, (c) 15th-19th Dec 2015. implications of ﬁxed and variable thresholds. It is worth not- ing from Fig 3(c) that variable threshold is more selective in spike separation than ﬁxed threshold. While ﬁxed threshold is constant at about $80/MWh in both Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), the variable threshold has been changed from around $80/MWh in the ﬁrst case to more than $100/MWh in the second case. Such a variation helps to separate only the distinct data points from the price dataset. All these selective properties of variable threshold help to form a more robust training dataset for training the classiﬁcation model. The electricity price dataset from October 2014 to Decem- ber 2015 is used for validating the proposed detection model. The data from October 2014 to September 2015 is used for training the model and then the trained model is used for testing the data from October to December 2015. The number of spikes and percentages in terms of its occurrences are given in Table 3 and Table 4 for training and testing periods, respectively. It can be seen from Tables 3 and 4 that the spikes contribute a very small percentage, less than 1.60%, in each case. More speciﬁcally, the proportions of spikes separated by variable threshold are 0.97% and 1.04% for the training and testing datasets, respectively, while these numbers are 1.12% and 1.57% for ﬁxed threshold separation. B. SIGNIFICANT FEATURES Signiﬁcant features can be revealed using the Fisher score, which has been discussed in Section III-A. When the spikes are separated using variable thresholds as discussed and pre- sented in Section IV-A, the signiﬁcant level of each individual is estimated and the results are given in Fig. 4. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the dominated individ- ual attributes are surplus generation, supply demand index, demand, and relative demand index whose Fisher scores are 2.672, 2.383, 2.001, and 1.818 respectively. For the visualiza- tion purposes, the histograms of spike and non-spike data are plotted in Fig. 5 for typical features as mentioned. For exam- ple in Fig. 5 (a), when the surplus generation is at low level, the probability of price spikes increases dramatically, thus VOLUME 9, 2021 13965 D. H.

Number of spikes and non-spikes in testing dataset. FIGURE 4. Fisher score of typical features. surplus generation is the most signiﬁcant feature (attribute), which also can be justiﬁed using the Fisher score in Fig 4. C. ANALYSIS OF SPIKE DETECTION RESULTS It has been illustrated in Table 3 that the non-spike data dominates the training dataset with 98% to 99% of the population. This causes extreme imbalance in the training dataset. This imbalance critically affects the model training process; consequently, the model performance can be seri- ously deteriorated. In order to reduce the imbalance issue, a resampling procedure is employed in the training phase. The resampling procedure only focuses on the dominated dataset, i.e. non-spike data. In other words, while the spike data remains the same, the non-spike data is resampled by taking some random samples. These random samples are then used in conjunction with the spike data to train the model. Different cases of resampling can be conducted based on different fold- divisions (or different percentage of data resampling). In this study, 7 resampling rates are considered and the details are given in Table 5. It can be seen from Table 5 that when the resampling rate reduced from 100% to 1%, the number of spikes remain the same, while the number of non-spikes reduces by one- hundredth times. As a result, the percentage of the spike increases from nearly 1% to nearly 50%. It is noted that each resampling rate will result in different random division of non-spike data points. Use of one division and non-use of oth- ers may lead to a slightly varying result in the testing process. FIGURE 5. Distribution of typical features. Accordingly, the average results of different divisions are considered for the comparative study. With different resampling rates, detection rate (DR) of the classiﬁer is investigated using linear kernel SVM classiﬁer. The performance in terms of false alarm (FA) is analyzed for three typical cases, which are FA of 2%, 3% and 4%, as presented in Fig. 6. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the DR changes signiﬁcantly at different data resampling rates. Looking more speciﬁcally at the line representing FA of 2%, DR reduces from around 78% to approximately 70% when resampling rate reduces from 100% to 50%. As the resampling rate decreases further, the DR increases to a peak value of 80% at 10% resampling rate before it experiences a gradual reduction to 73% at 1% resampling rate. 13966 VOLUME 9, 2021 D. H. Vu et al.: Multi-Feature Based Approach Incorporating Variable Thresholds for Detecting Price Spikes TABLE 5. Spikes and non-spikes in the training dataset at different resampling rates. TABLE 6. Spikes in training dataset with different resampling rates when fixed threshold is used. FIGURE 6. Performance of linear kernel SVM at different data resampling rate. While the DR for FA of 3% and FA of 4% experience same reduction from 80% to 72% at half resampling rate, the variation is different at the smaller resampling rates. The line representing FA of 3% shows that DR increases and achieves the peak of 84% at 10% resampling rate before having slight reduction to 82% at 1% resampling rate. The line representing FA of 4% depicts a strong DR increase from 72% to nearly 85% when resampling rate reduces from 50% to 10%, while the DR increases slowly there onwards to about 86% at 2% resampling rate and subsequently, remains constant. A similar resampling process is applied to the train- ing dataset when ﬁxed threshold is used for reducing the imbalance in the dataset. The obtained results are given in Table 6. It can be seen from Table 6 that the smaller resampling rate leads to higher percentage of spikes in training dataset. Com- paring the values given in Tables 5 and 6, it can be seen that the spike percentage is higher when a ﬁxed threshold is used instead of variable threshold, for the same resampling rate, FIGURE 7. Performance of linear SVM when spikes are separated using fixed and variable threshold. because more spike separation occurs. The higher percentage of spikes in this case does not necessarily indicate goodness of spike separation since the performance of the detection model is entirely dependent on the proper separation of spikes, not the number of spikes separated. In order to compare the effectiveness of the two thresholds, the area under curve (AUC) is plotted when different data resampling rates are used as shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the model with variable threshold outperforms the model using ﬁxed threshold in most of the cases. Also, it can be seen from this ﬁgure that both models achieve relatively highest performance at the resampling rate of 5%. Consequently, 5% resampling rate is used for further investigation of the classifying model when different kernel functions are employed. At the resampling rate of 5%, different kernel functions, which are Gaussian RBF and the polynomial function, are investigated. An analysis has been conducted to determine the parameter of the classiﬁer. The obtained results are given in Table 6. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic VOLUME 9, 2021 13967 D. H.

ROC curves of SVM model with different kernels (a) fixed threshold, (b) variable threshold. TABLE 7. Parameters of Different Kernel used in the SVM classifier. (ROC) curves are plotted for ﬁxed threshold and variable threshold and shown in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) respectively. It can be seen from Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) that the model performs extremely well for AUC over 0.95 pu. Comparing the performance of the model for ﬁxed threshold, as shown in Fig. 8(a), and variable threshold, as shown in Fig. 8(b), it is clear that the variable threshold results in better performance of the classiﬁcation model at every FA rate with higher true positive rate (i.e., DR). As shown in Table 7, the model performs well with variable threshold for each kernel function i.e., linear, RBF, and polynomial. Also, it is seen from the last 2 columns of Table 7 that the RBF function supersedes other kernel functions (giving the highest AUC). This is due to the ability of the RBF function to capture the non-linear and non-separable characteristics of the spikes in the price dataset. V. CONCLUSION In this paper, a multi-feature based approach with the incor- poration of a variable threshold is developed to detect elec- tricity price spikes. The variable threshold, determined using a sliding window average and an adjusted standard deviation, helps to separate spikes from the normal price data. Such an effective separation creates a robust training dataset for developing a high performance spike detection model. Furthermore, signiﬁcant features have been extracted from the different variables of the NEM after thoroughly analyzing causes of the price spikes. Fisher score has been assigned to estimate the signiﬁcance of these features. The extracted features have been utilized to train a detection model, which is developed based on a SVM structure. This model demon- strates an ability to reﬂex both nonlinear and non-saparatable characteristics of the price spikes with the consideration of kernel functions. A case study has been presented using a dataset acquired from the State of NSW, Australia to validate the proposed model. The results highlight the fact that the proposed method can successfully detect the price spikes with high accuracy and low FA rate. REFERENCES [1] J. Huang, Y. Xue, Z. Y. Dong, and K. P.
