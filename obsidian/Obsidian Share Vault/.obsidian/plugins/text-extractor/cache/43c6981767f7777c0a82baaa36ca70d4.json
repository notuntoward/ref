This article analyses the general performance of WPPT as well as its performance during large ramps (swings) in power output.

Large ramps are considered critical events for a wind power forecast for energy trading as well as manag- ing power system security. A methodology is developed to detect large ramp events in the wind farm power data. Forty-one large ramp events are detected over 1 year and these are categorized according to their predictability by MesoLAPS,the mechanical behaviour of the wind turbine, the power change observed on the grid and the source weather event. During these events, MesoLAPS and WPPT are found to give an RMSE only roughly equivalent to just predicting the mean (climatology forecast). Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

E-mail: n.cutler@unsw.edu.au Introduction As more wind power is installed in electricity markets, the importance of forecasting the wind power increases. Due to the lack of any large-scale storage system for electricity after it is produced, the power system is con- tinually managed so that the supply meets the demand. The main two clients of wind power forecasts are market participants such as energy traders, and power system operators. To manage their operations effectively, they forecast the energy demand and spot prices so that the scheduling of conventional power sources is opti- Key words: wind power forecast; short-term prediction; large ramp; swing; meteorology; weather event; power system security; energy trading mized. The amount of wind power available for dispatch is highly dependent on the wind speed at the wind farm locations. Hence to continue optimised management of the electricity grid and market, the available wind power needs to be predicted also. A suite of forecasting tools with different techniques is used for wind power forecasting, such as that described in Giebel et al.1 The Danish statistical wind power forecasting system, Wind Power Prediction Tool (WPPT),2 is installed to forecast the power output from the 65 MW Roaring 40s Renewable Energy P/L Woolnorth Bluff Point Wind Farm (the Wind Farm) for use by the Hydro Tasmania (HT) energy traders in the NEM. WPPT combines real-time wind power observations with wind speed and direction forecasts from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, MesoLAPS,3 to make hourly forecasts of the wind farm power output. This ﬁrst of two parts of this paper evaluates the general performance of MesoLAPS and WPPT to meet the needs of the energy traders at HT. The energy traders at HT indicated that predicting large ramps in wind power output would be most valu- able, particularly if they occur at night where the change in wind power output is a higher fraction of the total demand (Hydro Tasmania Energy Traders, personal communication, 2006). Hence, the second part of the paper focuses on large ramps in wind power output. A methodology for detecting large ramp events in the wind power data is developed, along with a classiﬁcation for the ramp events based on the mechanical behaviour and the weather system causing the ramp. The general performances of the MesoLAPS and WPPT forecasts are also examined for the periods during the large ramp events. The speciﬁcs of the Wind Farm and the data used in this project are described in the following section. This is followed by a description of how WPPT works and forecast evaluation measures. Then, the general perfor- mances of the forecasts from MesoLAPS and WPPT at Woolnorth are presented. This is followed by a descrip- tion of a large ramp event detection method and a categorization of the events detected in 1 year of data. Finally, the performances of the forecasts are evaluated for large ramp events and conclusions are made. The Wind Farm and Data From 2004 until recently, the Woolnorth Bluff Point Wind Farm has been the only wind farm in the Tasmania region of the NEM. The Wind Farm rated power of 65 MW represents 6·5% of a typical overnight demand minimum for Tasmania and the average error in HT demand forecasts is around 3% (R. Beswick, personal com- munication, 2006). Hence an instantaneous wind power forecast error of up to 6.5% of demand could coincide unfavourably with a typical 3% demand forecast error to give a much higher effective forecast error for the scheduling of conventional power plants. The Wind Farm is located on the north-west tip of Tasmania (see Figure 1) on an outpost location capturing the prevailing westerly winds coming from the southern ocean (see Figure 2). This, in combination with the fact that it is a coastal site on a cliff, gives the site a very high wind resource on average. These factors also make the wind resource extremely variable; thus, it is a challenging site for wind power forecasting as well as an ideal site to observe large ramps in wind power output. Tasmania’s power system was connected to the mainland for the ﬁrst time in 2006 with the commissioning of the undersea DC-cable, Basslink. This has given the HT energy traders a new set of conditions for manag- ing river ﬂows, dam levels and proﬁts with their 19 hydropower stations in the Australian NEM. Due for commissioning in 2007, the Wind Farm is being expanded to a total rated power for the farm to 140 MW, or 14% of the overnight Tasmanian demand minimum. In preparation for this, HT installed the WPPT in March 2006. The WPPT predictions are in hourly steps for a prediction horizon of up to 42 h, limited by the available range of MesoLAPS forecasts. WPPT combines historical wind farm power output data back to October 2004 with current wind speed and direction forecasts for the region obtained twice a day from MesoLAPS. All the results in this paper are analysed for 1 year of data (April 2005 to March 2006) to avoid any sea- sonal bias. Although the standard time for NWP systems is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), all times in this paper are in Eastern Standard Time (EST) which is 10 h ahead of UTC. EST is the standard time used in the Australian NEM, and also indicates the time of day in the eastern states of Australia including Tasmania. In the NEM, the trading day is deﬁned as 24 h starting at 04:00. Energy traders make their ﬁrst energy bids to 454 N. Cutler et al. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Photo of some of the wind turbines of the Wind Farm the National Electricity Market Management Company Limited (NEMMCO) for a given trading day, 16 h prior to its commencement at 12:00 on the previous day. A typical day for the HT energy traders involves a reassess- ment of these bids at 22:00, 6 h before the trading day starts. The results in this work are based on the fore- casts that are available at 22:00 for the following trading day. MesoLAPS and WPPT forecasts made at other times were also analysed (not shown), but the results from these show a similar performance. The locations of the Wind Farm’s 37 turbines on the site are shown in Figure 3. Wind speed and direction measurements were obtained with a 2·5 min resolution from two 50 m towers located at the north and south ends of the Wind Farm (also shown). The data from the two towers are combined to make one data set where no measurements are taken in the wake of nearby wind turbines. Hourly values for the wind speed and direc- tion observations are made for a particular hour by averaging all the available observations from 2·5 min past the previous hour up to the observation on the hour. The wind rose for Woolnorth (not shown) indicates that the predominant direction is from the WSW. Around 30% of the measurements recorded wind directions of 240° ± 15°. The NWP model used for the WPPT predictions is the BoM MesoLAPS 12·5 km resolution model, which has a limited domain over Australia. The initial conditions for this model are interpolated down from the BoM LAPS 37·5 km analysis. Wind speed and direction forecasts are obtained from the model at 10 m height at the grid point location of 40·75°S, 144·75°E, shown in Figure 3. These forecasts are hourly up to 48 h. However, they are not available until over 5 h after the initialization time, making the effective maximum forecast horizon 42 h. The MesoLAPS model is run twice daily at 10:00 and 22:00. The most recent forecast available at 22:00 is the previous 10:00 forecast which is already 12 h old. Two wind power data sets are available for the Wind Farm. One data set contains sampled wind power observations every 5 min. This data set is averaged to hourly values in a similar manner to that described earlier with the wind speed observations and this is the observation data used by WPPT. Hence, the 5 min data set is used to evaluate the performance of WPPT. The other data set is the Vestas Online data set which is obtained as average power values every 10 min. This data set is more reliable than the 5 min power data, mainly due to the 5 min data becoming unavailable during wind farm shutdown due to high wind speeds. The Vestas Online data is also averaged to hourly data in the same manner as described above. The Vestas Online data is used for the large ramp analysis. 456 N. Cutler et al.

A map of the Wind Farm site, showing the locations of the 37 wind turbines, the locations of the two 50 m monitoring towers, and the location of the NWP grid point. The ﬁlled-in sections are the ocean All power observations used are the total wind farm output, assuming 100% availability. These are made by aggregating the available wind turbine power observations and scaling up to a fully 37-turbine operational wind farm. This is to remove all effects from maintenance, and faulty measurements, retaining only the weather- induced wind power output (which includes all the designed behaviour of the wind turbines such as shutdown due to high wind speeds). The wind power data is rejected if less than 10 wind turbines have available measurements. How WPPT Works WPPT makes a statistical combination of recent wind power measurements and future wind speed and direc- tion predictions to make a wind power prediction. First, WPPT builds a power curve function based on a few months of historical data. The function relates the wind speeds and directions predicted by the NWP to a cor- responding power output, thus giving a three-dimensional power curve. There is a different power curve for each prediction horizon since the accuracy of the NWP model predictions varies with prediction horizon. An example of the WPPT power curve is shown in Figure 4, split into two sectors, 0–100° and 100–360°. The higher power curve for 0–100° indicates that the Wind Farm receives a lower wind speed in this sector than for 100–360°, for the same MesoLAPS predicted wind speed. The WPPT forecast is based on equation (1), which describes the WPPT forecast for 1 h ahead: (1) where the subscripts represent the time and k is the current time; Pˆ k+1 is the power prediction at time k + 1, in this case representing 1 h in the future; Pk is the current wind power measurement (at time k); Pk−1 is the power measurement from the previous hour (at time k − 1); ˆ ˆ , cos sinPP Pf wspd wdir ih i h kk k pc k k i c k i s k i +− + + ++ = =+ + () ++     +∑11 2 1 3 1 1 4 1 24 4 1 24 5 1 3 2 24 2 24 qq q q p q p q Detecting, Categorizing and Forecasting Large Ramps in Wind Power 457 Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The directions are divided into two groups, less and greater than 100° to demonstrate the directional dependence h24 k+1 is the time of day for 1 h ahead; fˆ pc(wspdk+1, wdirk+1) is the power curve function, which is a non-linear transformation of the wind speed (wspdk+1) and wind direction (wdirk+1) NWP predictions made for time k + 1, and qi are parameters or weightings for each term in the equation. The term in equation (1) involving the cosines and sines is for modelling diurnal effects on the wind power. The last term in equation (1) is a bias term, which allows a weighting on climatology (predicting the mean power) predictions. From previous forecasts, WPPT adapts the weightings (q) to minimize the overall predic- tion error. There is a different set of optimal weights used for each prediction horizon. Typically for a prediction horizon of 1 h, the weightings for the current and previous power measurements (q1 and q2) are around 0·4, around 0·2 for the power curve weighting (q3) and negligible values for the remaining two terms. As the prediction horizon grows, the dependence on persistence naturally decreases and the power observation weights are close to zero for horizons greater than 8–12 h. The power curve weighting increases to compensate for this. However, as the prediction horizon increases above 24 h, the NWP prediction errors grow and the bias term weighting (climatology) can start to have a non-negligible value. WPPT is described in more detail in Madsen et al.2 Evaluating the Forecast Performance One of the standard measures to quantify the overall performance of a forecast is to calculate the square root of the mean of the square of the errors (RMSE) for each prediction. In Lange’s PhD thesis,4 he describes how the RMSE can be decomposed into three parts (see equation (2)), each evaluating the accuracy of the forecast on different attributes: (2) The ﬁrst component is the BIAS, deﬁned as the difference between the mean of the predictions and the mean of the measurements, thus indicating whether the measurements are on the whole under-predicted or over-pre- dicted. The second is the bias of the standard deviation, SDBIAS, deﬁned as the difference between the stan- dard deviations of the predictions and measurements. Thus, the SDBIAS describes whether the variability of the measurements is over- or under-predicted. The BIAS and SDBIAS considered together, describe the con- tribution of amplitude errors to the RMSE. Finally, the third part is the dispersion, DISP. It is proportional to one minus the cross-correlation coefﬁcient between the predictions and measurements. DISP represents to some extent the error that is irremovable with statistical time-independent linear corrections. The formulae for these parts are described in more detail in previous studies.4–6 General Performance of the Forecasts General Performance of MesoLAPS Figure 5 shows the RMSE of the 10:00 MesoLAPS predictions compared with the 50 m met tower wind speeds for different prediction horizons, normalized with the mean measured wind speed. The equivalent local time is shown on the upper x-axis and the vertical dotted lines indicate the NEM trading day. The BIAS, SDBIAS and DISP are also shown. The ﬁfth curve is obtained from linear regression to produce a least squares ﬁt between the MesoLAPS wind speed forecast and the observations. The RMSE is then calculated from the residuals between the data and the linear ﬁt. This represents the MesoLAPS forecasts that WPPT has to work with, since WPPT effectively performs a sophisticated bias correction on the NWP forecast. The BIAS shows a clear diurnal variation indicating that the wind speed is more under-predicted at night than during the day. This diurnal variation also appears in the total RMSE curve. Both the BIAS and SDBIAS are negative which describes overall under-predicted amplitudes of the wind speed. This is expected since the NWP model height is 10 m and the measured wind speeds are at 50 m. However, another contribution to this is likely to be that the NWP model cannot fully realize the complex terrain speed-up effects, since the terrain is smoothed out in the 12·5 km resolution of the model. The DISP shows a more steady positive error, which has a slight increasing trend with prediction horizon. There is also a small hint of the same diurnal variation RMSE BIAS SDBIAS DISP 22 2 2=+ + 458 N. Cutler et al. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Wind Energ 2007; 10:453–470 DOI: 10.1002/we characterized above. The RMSE of the residuals from the least squares regression cannot be compared directly with the other error measures. However, it has very similar characteristics to the DISP. This gives evidence for the theory that statistical linear correction methods can remove the BIAS and SDBIAS (and in this case, much of the associated diurnal variation), but not the DISP. General Performance of WPPT The general performance of WPPT is shown in Figure 6 for the same year of data, normalized with the rated power of the Wind Farm. The overall RMSE of the WPPT forecast is plotted along with the RMSE of the power curve component of WPPT only. The RMSE of the standard persistence and climatology forecasts are shown for comparison. For a prediction horizon of 36 h, a persistence forecast of wind power has been calculated to around 35% for less variable sites in Europe in the ANEMOS project,7 but for this site it is closer to 50%. Climatology gives an RMSE of 35%, which is also greater than a typical ﬁgure of 30% for less variable sites. The full WPPT forecast RMSE is lower than all comparison curves on the plot for prediction horizons less than 11 h, where the statistical algorithm has signiﬁcant weightings on the observations. From 11 h and onwards, the RMSE of the power curve and full WPPT forecasts are nearly identical demonstrating that most of the weight- ing is on the power curve, i.e. the NWP wind speed and direction forecasts. The RMSE of WPPT at 36 h is around 25%, which is a signiﬁcant improvement over climatology and persistence. As with the reference fore- casts, this is higher than for the results obtained for less variable sites in Europe in the ANEMOS project where the RMSE of WPPT has been demonstrated to be between 12 and 20% after 36 h. However, these ANEMOS results included one highly variable site where WPPT had a similar RMSE to Woolnorth of around 25% after 24 h. As with the wind speed forecast (from MesoLAPS), the wind power forecast (from WPPT) RMSE is sep- arated into the BIAS, SDBIAS and DISP in Figure 7 with the same x-axes as the previous RMSE plot (Figure Detecting, Categorizing and Forecasting Large Ramps in Wind Power 459 Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The RMSE is shown, along with its components, the BIAS, SDBIAS and DISP. The RMSE of the residuals from a least squares ﬁt between the MesoLAPS wind speed forecast and observations is also shown. The vertical dotted lines outline the forecasts used in the NEM trading day 6). The BIAS is close to zero, demonstrating that WPPT has successfully removed this component (along with the associated diurnal variation) as is expected from theory. The SDBIAS is only close to zero for small pre- diction horizons and grows steadily from there. This indicates that WPPT was able to remove some of the errors in the NWP variability by using recent observations. The negative values for the SDBIAS indicate that WPPT under-predicts the variability of the wind power. This can be explained by the coarse resolution of the NWP model to resolve the speed-up and small-scale effects of the semi-complex terrain at Woolnorth. Most of this is probably due to the cliff on the western side of the Wind Farm, which would be smoothed out in the NWP model. Negative SDBIAS values are also obtained for complex sites in Lange’s PhD thesis.4 The DISP and total RMSE curves are very similar showing that WPPT removed almost all of the BIAS and SDBIAS. Over the ﬁrst 8 h, DISP and the total RMSE grow steeply compared with in Figure 5. This indicates that WPPT was able to remove some of the DISP component using recent observations as well. Large Ramps in Wind Power Output Deﬁnition and Methodology Large ramps in wind power output (also referred to as extreme events, rapid changes or swings) are important behaviour to forecast from a power system security perspective as well as for electricity trading. 8,9 For elec- tricity trading, a large ramp in wind power could bring on a sudden signiﬁcant change to the market situation. For power system security, a large ramp in wind power could require a fast response from other generators to maintain the supply-demand balance, or to keep the power ﬂow below the line rating in a constrained part of the network. The importance of any particular wind power ramp to an energy trader is very context speciﬁc, depending on the current market demand and spot prices (Hydro Tasmania Energy Traders, personal communication, 2006). For power system security, it depends on current network ﬂows and energy demand. This type of infor- mation is difﬁcult to quantify. A statistical method to detect instances of large ramps using only power data is 460 N. Cutler et al. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The general performance of the WPPT wind power forecasts initialised at 22:00 evaluated against the wind power measurements. The RMSE of the WPPT power curve is shown as well as the whole algorithm forecast. The RMSE for forecasts made using persistence and climatology are shown for comparison. Other attributes are the same as Figure 5 described below. If these were forecast accurately, they could then be used by the energy trader or power system operator in the current situation to decide what action is required. The same period of 12 months of Vestas Online data is used as for the results shown in the previous section. The detection methodology used for this is based on ﬁnding instances where the change in power output of the wind farm changes by more than some threshold within a certain time. Noting the different timescales of power ramps, and the different weather phenomena that cause them, a two-stage detection method is used as described in the following: • Stage 1: Find all instances of where the hourly averaged power changes by more than 75% of rated power within 3 h. Two individual hourly ramps occurring within 6 h of each other are considered the same event. • Stage 2: Removing the periods of time for where ramp events were found in stage 1; ﬁnd all instances where the 10 min averaged power changes by more than 65% of rated power in 1 h. Two 10 min ramps are consid- ered individual events if they occur more than 1 h apart. These are later combined if they occur roughly on the same day, and categorized as a variable period. Due to the 12·5 km spatial resolution of MesoLAPS, the model should only be expected to capture weather phenomena that have a wavelength of at least twice this scale, or 25 km. Weather phenomena on this scale include local wind ﬁelds, mountain winds, land/sea breezes and mesoscale convective complexes. These occur on timescales of around 1 h or greater.10 In addition to this, the MesoLAPS and WPPT forecasts are provided once per hour at HT. Hence ramps detected in the hourly averaged data represent the events that NWP models such as MesoLAPS should be able to capture to some extent. The second stage of the ramp detection method aims to detect ramps that occur due to a different set of weather phenomena such as localized turbulent variability, which MesoLAPS is not designed to model directly. However, the ramps detected in stage 2 could also be important for energy trading or power system security, depending on the situation. To decide on the threshold values used, a sensitivity analysis is made varying the values in each stage. All combinations of threshold values between 90 and 40% of rated power with a resolution of 5% are tried, and Detecting, Categorizing and Forecasting Large Ramps in Wind Power 461 Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The general performance of the WPPT wind power forecasts made at 22:00 evaluated against the wind power measurements. The RMSE of the WPPT is shown along with its components, BIAS, SDBIAS and DISP. Other attributes are the same as Figure 5 the resulting numbers of ramp events are recorded. Naturally, the number of detected ramp events increases as the threshold values decrease. The results are encapsulated in Figure 8 which shows the total number of ramp events obtained for the different combinations of threshold values. Two distinct kinks are observed in the curves at 10 min thresholds of 45 and 65%; however, the hourly threshold has virtually no impact on the ﬁnal number of events for a 10 min threshold of 45%. At the 10 min threshold of 65%, the rate that the number of events rises increases as the hourly threshold is reduced from 75 to 70%. This suggests a statistical sensi- tivity optimum for threshold values of 75 and 65% for stages 1 and 2, respectively. These values are conﬁrmed numerically by evaluating the sensitivity about a particular threshold value, th, as the ratio of the increase in the number of ramp events found using the next lowest threshold value, th − 5, to the increase in the number of events found using th compared with the next largest threshold, th + 5. This assumes that the other thresh- old value (10-min or hourly) is kept constant and is described by equation (3): (3) where nth is the number of ramp events detected using a particular threshold value, th, and th − 5 is threshold value of 5% less than th. It is considered that the higher the value of this ratio, the more sensitive the threshold value (and visually the larger the kink in the curve). By ﬁxing one threshold value, eqn (3) indicates a maximum in the sensitiv- ity for the other threshold value. Maxima occur at the threshold values suggested above; 75% and 65% for stage 1 and 2 respectively. Using these values, a total of 41 ramp events is detected in the 1 year of data. Two examples of these events are shown in the following section. Examples of Large Ramp Events Two examples of large ramp events are shown in the following.

Each line represents a ﬁxed value for the stage 1 threshold (hourly data), with the stage 2 threshold (10 min data) on the x-axis. The hourly threshold values of 90% and below 60% have been omitted for clarity introduced earlier. Continuous 24 h forecasts are pasted together and hence the plots show a discontinuity between 04:00 and 05:00. The WPPT forecast at 04:00 is for a 30 h prediction horizon whereas at 05:00 the horizon is only 7 h. The corresponding MesoLAPS forecast horizons are 42 and 19 h, respectively. Informa- tion on the broad weather situations during the large ramp events is also shown using the publicly available mean sea level pressure (MSLP) analyses from the BoM. These analyses are available every 6 h. Shutdown Example The wind turbines installed in the Wind Farm are designed to shut down where a 10-min mean wind speed of more than 25 m s−1 is recorded by the ultrasonic anemometer mounted on top of the wind turbine. This is to protect the turbine from damage in extreme wind conditions. The wind turbines are then designed to restart when the mean wind speed falls below 22 m s−1. An example of a shutdown is shown in Figure 9, occurring on 31 August 2005, where the wind power obser- vations were 100% available for the 24 h shown. In this case, the shutdown lasted for around 5 h. Not shown in the hourly averaged data, the entire wind farm goes from near rated power to near zero in 20 min. This ramp coincides with a sharp increase in the measured wind speed above 25 m s−1. The measured wind speeds then remain above 25 m s−1 during the shutdown period. A rapid wind direction change of 60° is observed at the same time as the wind speed ramp.

Three MSLP analyses are shown in C, with their corresponding analysis times indicated on the above plots with the dotted vertical lines The bias corrected MesoLAPS wind speeds do not model the sharp increase in wind speed very well and over- estimate the wind speed prior to the ramp. During the shutdown however, the general level of the MesoLAPS wind speeds is very close to the measured wind speeds. The WPPT predictions stay at full rated power through- out this whole period, despite the well-predicted high wind speeds. An additional shutdown module is available with WPPT but was not installed at Woolnorth since, as explained earlier, the wind power observations used by WPPT become unavailable during shutdown. The MesoLAPS wind directions predict the directional change, but this is again more gradual than the observed sharp change in direction with the power ramp. The corresponding MSLP analyses charts are also shown for 04:00, 10:00 and 16:00 EST on 31 August. The chart sequence indicates that a frontal system passes over the Wind Farm a few hours prior to the ramp and is closely followed by a low pressure system and a trough. As the trough passes and the low pressure system deepens and moves south, the Wind Farm becomes exposed to a new air mass with strong prevailing westerly winds. Changing Wind Resource Example Another example of a large ramp event occurred on 21 December 2005 and this is shown in Figure 10. The ramp event observed in the wind power data coincides with the observed wind speeds, indicating that the changing wind resource is causing the ramp. There appears to be a dip in the MesoLAPS wind speeds with good levels although 4 h too early. The WPPT predictions follow the wind speed predictions, thus also reﬂect- ing the 4 h timing error and the dip is too shallow, staying to close to half of the rated power. The MSLP analyses show a front approaching the Wind Farm at 22:00 with a prefrontal trough. The 04:00 analysis shows the front still lagging the trough slightly, and dips in the wind speed and power are observed 464 N. Cutler et al. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Wind Energ 2007; 10:453–470 DOI: 10.1002/we Figure 10. An example of a large ramp event where both the wind power and speed change together. This occurred on 21 December 2005. The attributes are the same as in Figure 9 over the next 6 h. It is a common situation where a prefrontal trough causes a temporary lull in wind speed, followed by a sharp increase in wind speed when the front passes, bringing the new air mass and a change in wind direction. The MesoLAPS direction forecasts this directional change although too gradually and too early. This is typical of all the ramps, where the coarse resolution of the NWP model does not allow the model to capture sharp changes accurately. Furthermore, the detailed terrain of Woolnorth Bluff Point as shown in Figure 3 is modelled on a 12·5 km grid, meaning that effectively the entire grid map shown is represented by approx- imately one grid point. Hence, even if the broad nature of a sharp change is modelled accurately by MesoLAPS, the nature of the change as it affects the wind farm is nearly impossible to model well. Summary of the Ramp Events In total, 41 large ramp events were detected in the 1 year of data. This is made up of 19 events detected in the hourly data and 22 events in the 10 min data—stage 1 and stage 2, respectively—of the algorithm described earlier. This is after rejecting one of the detected 10 min events blamed on human interference, since all the wind turbine blades are pitched out of the wind but no signiﬁcant wind speed or direction changes are observed. On close inspection, six of the 10 min ramp events can be considered varying on an hourly timescale and thus could be predicted by MesoLAPS. These are not detected in stage 1 because they just fall outside the 75% threshold. Labelling these 10 min events as hourly events gives 25 hourly events and 16 10 min events. The events are classiﬁed according to the cause of the swing from the turbine perspective and then from the weather system perspective, as shown in Tables I and II for the hourly and 10 min events, respectively. The ramp events are separated into two main categories: where the ramps in wind power are coincidental with similar ramps in wind speed (hereafter referred to as wind speed ramps), and where the power ramp does not have a similar ramp in the wind speed. There are two types of the latter category, shutdown due to high wind speeds and yaw-misalignment. The two yaw-misalignment ramps (Table II) coincide with a rapid 70° change in the observed wind direction, where the turbines are suddenly misaligned with the wind direction. To avoid damage when this occurs, the wind turbines are designed to shut down and yaw to face the new direc- tion before coming back online. In both cases, this process took less than 10 min, but seemed to involve most of the turbines in the farm at the same time. The Vestas turbines are actually able to yaw a full 360° in 15 min (D. Cameron, personal communication, 2006). The shutdown and yaw-misalignment events appear as a dip in power on the grid, i.e. a ramp down fol- lowed by a ramp up. Interestingly, even though not all of the shutdown cases involve a signiﬁcant change in wind direction, all of the shutdown and yaw-misalignment ramp events occur with a post-event wind direc- tion of between 240° and 270° (WSW-W). This is the prevailing wind direction for the farm which is also the direction of the strongest winds. The shutdown events that do involve a wind direction change, all change from between 300° and 330°, or from the NW to the W or SW. The sector covering this range covers all the onshore Detecting, Categorizing and Forecasting Large Ramps in Wind Power 465 Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Thus, a condition for poten- tial shutdown is when a new air mass reaches Woolnorth from the southern ocean where the ﬂow is already onshore. Of the eight shutdown ramp events, six occurred in July or August (with the other two in early October) indicating a seasonal bias towards high wind speeds. For the 20 wind speed ramp events detected in hourly data, the wind direction also changes. Unlike the shut- down events, there is only one wind speed ramp event where both the wind directions before and after the change are within the 240° to 330° sector. For the other 19 events, the wind direction changes towards or away from onshore ﬂow. The design of the Wind Farm layout along the coastal cliff as shown in Figure 3 makes the Wind Farm sensitive to wind direction changes about the cliff line. The same broad scale wind speed would be received quite differently at the Wind Farm depending on its direction, from the ocean and cliff, or from a different direction. These 20 wind speed ramps appear on the grid as sharp increases in power (17 cases), or a sharp decrease in power (three cases). The remaining 10 min ramp events detected where the wind speed and wind power are correlated mostly show sharp peaks in wind power during generally weak wind situations. The wind direction typically varies within 20° during these cases with some exceptions. Generally, the ramps were evenly distributed throughout the day. Of the 20 hourly wind speed ramps, only two of them occurred in Autumn (March, April, May), while the other seasons showed an even spread. For all the shutdown cases, the MSLP analyses show that a strong frontal system was passing the farm. These fronts are found to be either connected with a deep low in the ocean south of Tasmania with central pressure less than 980 hPa, or as part of a deep trough. For both yaw-misalignment cases, a strong front on a deep trough is shown to be passing the Wind Farm. The hourly wind speed ramp events with correlated wind speed and power are all explainable from the MSLP charts with the exception of one where the wind directions do not match with the isobars. The MSLP charts show how the direction of the isobars changes over the Wind Farm as the systems move, causing the Wind Farm to receive rapid changes in the wind resource. About half of these are indicated as fronts, the others are caused by fast moving low pressure systems. A couple of cases involve high pressure systems in the Tasman Sea which move enough to bring on a change in the wind direction at Woolnorth. The 11 remaining ramp events detected in 10 min data are categorized as variable periods. For ﬁve of these cases, where the variability in wind power was prolonged over several hours, the MSLP charts show low pres- sure systems in the vicinity of the Wind Farm. Low pressure systems are known to give wind variability and to be the most difﬁcult situations to forecast.11 Other variable period ramp events featured one or two peaks 466 N. Cutler et al.

Other cases trough were due to wind variability occurring before or after the passing of fronts or a dip in wind power, and occurred a few hours before or after frontal systems, with the exception of one case where a high pressure system was located over Victoria, just north of Woolnorth. The detected ramps at Woolnorth show a very high correlation with the broad scale weather phenomena such as low pressure systems and fronts. In another study,12 many other causes for wind changes which would not be visible in MSLP charts are described such as sea breezes, the breaking of nocturnal inversions and thun- derstorm outﬂows. Woolnorth’s outpost location in north-west Tasmania is almost like a peninsula and this may reduce the chance of local effects occurring. For example, sea breezes occur at the coast when there is a strong temperature difference between the land and the sea, but there is more sea north-east of Woolnorth as can be seen in Figure 2 and is shown in Figure 3. Nocturnal inversions are known to occur at inland locations. Hence, inferring information about detected large ramps from MSLP charts may give less ideal results for wind farms at other locations. General Performance of MesoLAPS during Large Ramps Qualitatively, the MesoLAPS predictions are poor for large ramps in the sense that the changes predicted occur too gradually. This is an inherent property of the coarse resolution of NWP models, as well as the hourly res- olution of the forecasts as described earlier. If there is a timing error in the prediction of a large change in the wind speed, a similar timing error tends to exist in the wind direction forecast as well. For example, if the wind speed forecast predicts the change 2 h early, the wind direction change will tend to be around 2 h early as well. If the wind speed forecasts look very different to the observed wind speed, the wind direction fore- casts are also often very different to the observed wind directions. To quantitatively assess the performance of MesoLAPS during the ramps, the RMSE error is calculated for only the predictions made in the periods of the large ramp events. These MesoLAPS predictions are the con- tinuous predictions as, for instance, shown in Figures 9 and 10 (described earlier), and thus represent a mixture of prediction horizons from 19 to 42 h. Sixteen of the 20 wind speed ramp events in the hourly averaged data are chosen where there are valid forecast data. The RMSE is then calculated for MesoLAPS just for the hours within the noted periods of these events (normalized by the mean wind speed). An hour is added before and after each of the 16 events and the RMSE is recalculated. This process is continued up to 40 h before and after the event (representing around 3·5 days for each event). The results are shown in Figure 11 along with the RMSE from a climatology forecast for comparison. The plot shows the expected decline in the RMSE for MesoLAPS as more time is included where a large ramp is not occurring. The RMSE for climatology is actu- ally lower than for MesoLAPS for up to 9 h on each side of each event. From then, MesoLAPS starts giving lower RMSE values than climatology, and both curves decrease to approach the overall RMSE for the year. General Performance of WPPT during Large Ramps Figure 12 shows the results for the RMSE for WPPT during the same 16 wind speed ramp events, calculated in the same manner as for MesoLAPS, above. The RMSE for WPPT is nearly the same as for climatology for the periods of the events and it steadily declines as the period of time around each event increases as with the result for MesoLAPS in Figure 11. This shows that although WPPT is able to improve on the errors in Meso- LAPS, the net result is that WPPT and MesoLAPS add very little intelligent information to a prediction during a large ramp event compared with predicting the overall mean wind power, that is, based on the RMSE. Conclusions The characteristics of the Wind Farm location give the wind farm a very high wind resource on average, but also a high sensitivity to rapid changes in the wind resource. The Bureau of Meteorology NWP model, MesoLAPS and ENFOR’s wind power prediction tool WPPT, are used to predict the hourly wind power at Woolnorth for prediction horizons out to 42 h. In the RMSE sense, the forecasts are signiﬁcantly better than persistence and climatology. This result is however only as good as the poorest performances from WPPT from Detecting, Categorizing and Forecasting Large Ramps in Wind Power 467 Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Wind Energ 2007; 10:453–470 DOI: 10.1002/we various examples in Europe in the ANEMOS project.7 One reason for this is that the Woolnorth has higher and more variable wind resource than most of the sites used in the ANEMOS project. There are perhaps other better error comparisons for comparing sites such as normalising the RMSE with the mean wind speed or using the R-square statistic. These were tried for this project but were not shown. 468 N. Cutler et al. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The RMSE of the WPPT forecasts, evaluated only on the 16 ramp events the same as in Figure 11 A large ramp event detector is developed which identiﬁes occurrences of large ramp events in the wind power observation data. The detector assists in the ﬁrst important classiﬁcation of the large ramps, whether they are detectable in hourly averaged data or only in sub-hour data. This division is roughly the boundary of behaviour that MesoLAPS can model. The horizontal resolution of MesoLAPS and the typical speed of weather systems in the boundary layer, set a limitation of 1 h for the timescale of weather features. This, along with the fact that the MesoLAPS forecasts are only provided every hour, means that weather features varying on timescales less than 1 h cannot be expected to be predicted well. Furthermore, this implies that with the current set-up for wind power forecasting, it is not possible to achieve better than a 1 h timing error in the prediction of an event. Forty-one ramp events are detected in the data over a 12 month period. Twenty-ﬁve of these are considered to be observable on the hourly timescale. Five of these are attributed to wind turbine shutdown due to wind speeds over 25 m s−1 and the other 20 are referred to as wind speed ramp events since the wind power change is coincidental with a change in wind speed. Sub-hourly ramp events also involve some shutdown cases, but also yaw-misalignment cases caused by a sudden jump in the wind direction, and variability cases during rel- atively benign conditions caused by nearby low pressure systems or pre- and post-frontal activity. Hence, the prediction of large ramps in wind power output involves the consideration of many different types of weather events. However, the events mentioned above are only broad scale, occurring above the boundary layer. Many localized effects are known to cause wind changes. It is intended to apply the ramp event detector on other wind farm sites, where large ramp events may be characterized by a different set of weather events. Some more intended further work, is to redevelop the ramp event detector for an aggregation of wind farms. The prediction horizons of forecasts analysed for large ramps were greater than 7 h, making the WPPT fore- casts heavily reliant on the MesoLAPS forecasts. The RMSEs of the forecasts are calculated for the periods of time during which 16 large ramp events are observed in hourly averaged data. It is found that a simple cli- matology forecast of the wind speed gives a signiﬁcantly lower RMSE than does MesoLAPS. For forecasting the wind power ramps WPPT improves this result, but still only gives a similar RMSE to a climatology fore- cast. This would suggest that MesoLAPS and WPPT give no useful information during a large ramp compared with predicting the mean; however, the result comes partially from the fact that the RMSE severely penalizes timing errors of ramps where the absolute forecast error can be up to 100% of the power output. This raises questions into the appropriateness of the RMSE performance measure, which depends on how the forecasts are used. Regardless of this, there would be considerable value in improving the timing of events in the fore- casts. Given that large ramps are one of the most important times to forecast the wind power, from an energy trader’s or power system security point of view, this is an area in much need of improvement.
