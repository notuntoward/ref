Digital Object Identiﬁer 10.1109/JESTPE.2021.3097827 TABLE I COMPARISON OF THE EXISTING BATTERY FAULT DIAGNOSIS METHODS in the future. As a key component, battery systems can largely determine the safety, drivability, and driving mileage of EVs [1]. A battery system composed of hundreds of cells in series and/or parallel conﬁgurations is, therefore, necessary due to the limited capacity and voltage of indi- vidual cells [2]–[4]. In spite of the continuing progress in battery manufacturing and packaging, battery faults may occur at each constituent or the associated accessories owing to the natural aging or abusive operation [5], [6]. In general, external abusive conditions, such as overcharging and short circuits, usually could lead to furious internal exothermic reactions inside battery packs [7]. When the heating rate exceeds the dissipation rate, the thermal runaway may occur, which gives rise to hazardous phenomena, such as smoking, gas venting, and even explosion [8]. However, due to the sensitivity and conﬁdentiality of the accident data to the car companies, it is still difﬁcult in obtaining accident data to perform veriﬁcations of the various diagnostic methods on the actual thermal runaway accident data, greatly hindering the advancement and development of high-safety battery systems in real-world vehicles. Table I shows the comparison of the existing battery fault diagnosis methods. Due to their inherent disadvantages and above-mentioned shortcomings, there is still much suffering in fault prognosis for real-scenario battery systems. B. Literature Review The common battery faults include faults of the battery itself, battery management system, sensors and connected components, and so on. The main body faults include gradual faults (capacity and power degradation) caused by battery aging and sudden faults (internal short circuit, thermal run- away, capacity dive, liquid leakage, and so on) that cause sudden failure of the power battery system or signiﬁcant 2168-6777 © 2021 IEEE.

HONG et al.: FAULT PROGNOSIS AND ISOLATION OF LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES IN EVs 89 performance degradation without obvious or short-term signs [9], [10]. Considerable efforts have been dedicated to tradi- tional fault diagnosis and prognosis of battery systems. For instance, in order to improve computational efﬁciency and applicability in embedded systems, Yan et al. [11] intro- duced the Lebesgue Sampling for fault diagnosis of batteries by adopting the philosophy of “execution when necessary.” They designed and implemented a particle ﬁlter to directly pick certain model parameters, such as power fade, state of health, and so on. Hu et al. [12] employed the advanced sparse Bayesian predictive modeling to capture the underlying correspondence between the capacity loss and the sample entropy. The proposed approach allows for an analytical integration of temperature effects to establish an explicitly temperature-perspective health estimator, whose performance and complexity are contrasted to the support vector machine scheme. Hong et al. [13], [14] presented a novel fault diagnosis method for battery systems in EVs based on big data and machine-learning methods. Through machine learning train- ing on real-vehicle operation big data, the multiforward-step prediction effect of multiple fault characteristic parameters of battery systems is obtained, and the early diagnosis of common battery abnormalities or faults based on the statistical thresh- old identiﬁcation method can be realized. Xiong et al. [15] proposed a simple and effective model-based sensor fault detection method for lithium-ion batteries using the unscented Kalman ﬁlter. Via the synthesized design of Luenberger and learning Observers, Chen et al. [16] proposed simultaneous fault isolation and estimation scheme for Li-ion batteries. The fault-detection residuals can be generated and the fault sources can be located simultaneously by using this method. Undetected faults would have detrimental effects on bat- teries and may lead to catastrophic accidents under some extreme conditions. One of the common faults that occur in battery cells is loose wire connections (LWCs). In battery packs, the cells’ wire connections are prone to becoming loose due to vibration and mechanical deformation during vehicular operations, thereby signiﬁcantly increasing the contact resis- tance [17]. This may result in more severe accidents due to arcing and melting at cell contact points under high-voltage and high-current conditions. If undetected, they may lead to heating, burning, or even explosion. Thus, the fault detection and isolation of wire connections between cells are instru- mental in preventing such latent hazards. However, there are a few related research studies in this area in recent years, and the existing literature mainly focuses on single-cell safety improvement by exploring appropriate electrolyte, electrode, and diaphragm materials [18]. In addition, the wire connection status of the battery is usually invisible, which makes it more difﬁcult to discern the wire connection fault through conventional monitoring or detecting methods. Cuomo [19] designed a systematic method for detecting battery LWC failures. He calculated the difference between the cell’s tem- perature and connectors’ temperature at a measured current via a comparator. If the measured value exceeds the predetermined threshold, an alarm will be declared. However, this system has poor stability and is prone to false alarms. Yao et al. [20] proposed a method to detect the wire connection status of Lithium-Ion batteries based on entropy. The experimental data shows that the ensemble Shannon entropy can predict the time and location of battery wire connection faults. However, this method is computationally intensive and has poor real-time monitoring performances. Xu et al. [21] used a ﬁrst-order RC equivalent circuit model to analyze the connection fail- ure of a battery pack. They determine the occurrence of contact-resistance fault by comparing voltage, current, and resistance before and after the fault. But, this method has too poor predicting performance to be predicted in time due to the hysteresis of the after-fault data. In order to comprehensively carry out fault prognosis research of battery systems from a multidomain perspective, except the above-mentioned time-domain methods with inher- ent disadvantages, the frequency-domain-oriented features are also potential solutions to be developed. At present, the com- monly used time-frequency conversion methods include Fourier transform [22], Laplace transform [23], and wavelet transform [24]. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is not only an important tool for theoretical analysis and engineering applications but also has certain inherent limitations, such as the lack of localized analysis capabilities and the inability to analyze nonstationary signals. Wavelet analysis was proposed by Grossmann and Morlet [25]. It is a new ﬁeld that is rapidly developing in applied mathematics and engineering based on Fourier analysis [26]. The wavelet transform inherits and develops the idea of localization of the short-time Fourier transform, and at the same time, overcomes the disadvantage that the window size does not change with frequency. There- fore, the wavelet transform is an ideal tool for time-frequency analysis and processing of nonstationary signals. “Thermal runaway” refers to the overheating phenomenon caused by the exothermic chain reaction inside the battery, which leads to the rapid change of temperature rise rate of the battery. The battery accidents under extreme conditions, such as mechanical damage, electrical abuse, and thermal abuse, are all in the form of thermal runaway. Therefore, it is important to realize accurate fault diagnosis and early isolation for battery systems. In the early stage of thermal runaway, a large amount of gaseous material is produced by the side reaction inside the battery, and the change of temperature, voltage, and other characteristic parameters is still not obvious; however, limited by the sensor precision and packaging technology, the above-mentioned thermal runaway diagnosis technology cannot be applied in the battery system. The fault diagnosis and safety control of battery systems based on the real-vehicle operation big data has strong research and application value, but the research work carried out by scholars is relatively small at present. Hong et al. [14] and Jichao et al. [27] used the real-vehicle operation data, combined with entropy judgment theory, proposed a battery thermal runaway diagnosis method. Zhao et al. [28] proposed an outlier identiﬁcation method based on direction propagation neural network machine learning algorithm and 3σ multilevel screening strategy for battery voltage faults and validated it in real vehicles, which provides guidance for the study of potential failure analysis of battery systems based on big data technology. However, the thermal runaway triggering causes Authorized licensed use limited to: Louisiana State University. Downloaded on August 29,2023 at 23:55:50 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Moreover, it has the characteristics of short reac- tion time, high danger, and strong coupling of characteristic parameters. Therefore, the existing fault diagnosis technology cannot realize the early identiﬁcation and accurate isolation of the fault signals before the thermal runaway accident. C. Contribution and Article Organization The main purpose of this article is to provide a real-time prognosis and isolation scheme based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for battery faults in real-world EVs. Three notable contributions and improvements to the current tech- niques are attempted to be implemented as follows. 1) Frequency-Domain-Based Signal Recognition: This work proposes a fault prognosis scheme using the DWT-based discrete wavelet decomposition (DWD). The early hidden faults signals within the conventional time-domain-based threshold range can be extracted, and the original signal can be perfectly restored through time-frequency conversion, overcoming the defects of the single-diagnostic index, short alarm time using the traditional fault alarm method based on the critical threshold of key parameters and the change rate. 2) Accurate Isolation for Fault Signals: The proposed method can accurately identify and isolate fault signals through the high-frequency detail signals in real time, restoring the time and location of the battery fault, and enabling online monitorable and traceable of battery faults before thermal runaway. 3) Real-Scenario Thermal Runaway Veriﬁcation: The real-vehicle operating data from a battery thermal run- away accident is derived for viability and reliability veriﬁcations. Taking into account the charging/driving characteristics, a multilevel prognosis strategy based on the normalized DWD (NDWD) method is developed, by which the real-time evaluation of the fault levels before battery thermal runaway can be performed. The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II describes the LWC fault and modes. Section III intro- duces the experimental platform and the prognosis method. Section IV validates the proposed NDWD-based fault progno- sis effects for a real-world accident vehicle. Section V presents conclusions. II. LOOSE WIRE CONNECTIONS AND MORE ANALYSIS A. Description of Loose Wire Connection Hundreds of cells are connected in a certain way through nuts or welding to form a battery pack. Due to the impact of accelerated stress on ﬁttings, it is easy to cause the battery to beat during the long-time running of an EV, which will produce a lot of calories, be prone to sparks, and even lead to combustion, explosion, or other serious consequences. When a wire connection becomes loose in a battery system, the system voltage always exhibits two characteristics. First, it has no obvious voltage ﬂuctuation in the initial period, which makes it difﬁcult to be discovered. Second, the deterioration of LWCs may be quickened and lead to spark in a few minutes. The LWC in a battery system has great inﬂuences on running vehicles in the following three aspects. 1) Safety: The running vehicles are often in the state of acceleration, deceleration, or uniform running. This will constantly alternate the discharging and charging status of the battery system, making the current change dramatically. The battery system with LWC will lead to the ﬁtting to rotate or beat with the vehicle’s vibration. It will make the contact among battery cells change from surface contact to point contact, then the resistance will increase in a short time; the relative motion will happen between the connecting piece and cell at the same time, which is easy to produce sparks even ﬁre. In addition, a battery system occurs LWC more often in the location of the contact joint between the connection point with the cell, but not the cells themselves. When the LWC occurs, the temperature of the cells themselves is not high and is hard to be detected by the battery management system. 2) Dynamic Performance: A battery system is the power source of the EV. If the internal connection is loose, the internal impedance will increase, and the inside local temperature of the battery system will occur mutations and produce a large number of calories. This will expand a part of battery energy and will shorten the travel mileage. At the same time, the local impedance of the battery system increases greatly, which also consumes the available energy of batteries and eventually leads to degrading the power performance. 3) Degraded Performance of Estimation: The battery man- agement system uses batteries’ terminal voltage and temperature at the measurement points. The voltage ﬂuctuation is not obvious at beginning of LWC, and it will gradually become quite severe when vehicles are running; the voltage ﬂuctuation will be accordingly bigger in terms of its magnitude, but the battery energy and state of charge are likely to be in a high-performance state [29]. This situation can eventually cause serious deviations when a battery’s residual capacity is being estimated. Even if the battery system has been carried on strict cal- ibration and selection before loading, after a period of time, the connection among single cells will gradually become loose in battery systems. First, in the process of assembling all ﬁttings of the battery system, there are certain processing stress and exist certain differences between each other of batteries. The stress cannot show itself in the stand-alone process, but the external load will impact ﬁttings and make them lose with the practical operation of EVs. Second, during the operation of the vehicle, the battery system will be inﬂuenced by drivers’ driving habits, bumps, and road conditions. The impacts on the ﬁttings in different spaces have a certain discrepancy, which will exacerbate imbalanced distribution even cause the ﬁttings to rupture, as shown in Fig. 1(a).

(b) Connection method and a stationary electrical connection. (c) Connection mode and unit n. In addition, certain differences in internal structures and the working environment in every single cell may cause different current densities on the ﬁttings. Then, the working stress between ﬁttings and single cells can become bigger and force ﬁttings to be loose or breaking. B. Analysis of Connection Modes Fig. 1(b) shows a schematic presentation of the connection method and a stationary electrical contact, showing the con- nection method of four cells in a battery pack. The cells are connected in series, and the connection contains connecting pieces and measuring wires that are bolted to the cells’ elec- trodes. A single cell and the connecting piece are combined to form a unit. C. Modeling a Battery With Connection Considered Based on the connection manner described in Fig. 1(b) and (c) further shows the connection mode and unit n, including a simpliﬁed and widely used Thevenin equivalent circuit model [30], where I is the current, R\u0003,n represents the internal resistance for unit n, Rc,n is the contact resistance between a cell and the connecting piece, Uocv,n is the open-circuit voltage (OCV) for unit n as an ideal voltage source, C p,n is a polarization capacitance, Un is the terminal voltage, and R p,n represents the sum of the concentration polarization impedance and electrochemical polarization impedance. Because the resistance of wires for measurements is much smaller than R\u0003,n, as a result, the voltage drop through the measuring wire would be neglected and the measured voltage Un could accurately predict the OCV; therefore, the relationship among these parameters can be formulated as follows: Un = Uocv,n(t) − I (t) × R\u0003,n − U p,n(t) − I (t) × Rc,n. (1) The OCV is a continuous function of the state of charge for the battery system. The polarization voltage and the internal resistance are determined by the internal chemi- cal substances, such as active materials at the positive and negative terminals of the battery; therefore, the change of the internal characteristics is not usually sudden but succes- sional unless the battery is crashed or exploded. However, Fig. 1(b) and (c) shows that the contact resistance is closely relevant to the connection status. If the pressure is too small to meet normal connection status, the contact area will have an obvious change and this change will affect the contact resistance. As the preliminary analysis, the cell voltage measurement cannot cause the power fade, but the increased internal resis- tance or contact resistance can lead to the fault in terms of severe change of voltage in the battery pack. The ﬂuctuation of terminal voltage is mainly due to the jump of the connection impedance. When the wire connection is in good condition, their magnitudes of the internal resistance and contact resis- tance are different and comparable [31]. The voltage change is mainly affected by the current, so it is difﬁcult to distinguish between them at this time. Whereas, when the wire connection status begins to deteriorate, the magnitude of the contact resistance will change greatly. At this time, the terminal voltage of the battery will undergo a severe jump in a short time, accompanied by a local high-temperature phenomenon. Therefore, the voltage ﬂuctuations depend mainly on the changes of the contact resistance in the event of LWCs, and the inﬂuence of the current on the voltage can be negligible at this time. In fact, the resistance is very difﬁcult to be accurately monitored in real time and can only be properly estimated during the EVs running, so the voltage can be applied to diagnose connection status when the wire connection status deteriorates, which is much easier for real-time monitoring and calculation. III. INTRODUCTION TO THE EXPERIMENTAL PLATFORM AND PROGNOSIS METHODS A. Experimental Platform and Preliminary Analysis In order to collect data for the fault in terms of LWC, an experimental test platform was set up, as shown in Fig. 2(a), which consists of a Digtron Battery Test System (BTS-600), a vibrating test bench, an information collector, several voltage sensors, and a host computer. The BTS-600 is assigned to charge/discharge the batteries according to a pre-designed loading proﬁle with a maximum voltage of 21 V and a max- imum constant charging/discharging current of 45 A, which is as shown in Fig. 2(b). The vibrating test bench is utilized to provide a vibration environment for the battery systems. The information collector is for logging the multichannel test data. Each of the tested Lithium-ion batteries has a nominal capacity of 50 Ah. Five battery cells are connected in series to form a small module. The voltage measurement is for four cells only while the ﬁfth cell will not be taken as the research object. Due to the vibration on the platform, there is severe noise corruption in the process of data collection. The discrete cosine transform [32] is used to ﬁlter the collected voltage data. The test of sweep-frequency vibration is conducted on a battery pack. When the charging/discharging starts in the condition of vibration, the voltage values will be collected by the information collector. After 30 charging/discharging cycles, the voltage curves in different loading cycles are obtained. The current and voltage curves of Cell 1 in the ﬁrst cycle are Authorized licensed use limited to: Louisiana State University. Downloaded on August 29,2023 at 23:55:50 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

It is clear that the deviation caused by system and measure- ment noises has been effectively ﬁltered out, and the voltage difference becomes more apparent after ﬁltering. The wire connections between cells are in good shape in the initial period, so the voltage ﬂuctuation is not obvious. However, with time increasing, the voltage vibration curve becomes more prominent, which shows that the measured voltage curves have changed obviously. The deviation caused by system and/or measurement noises can be effectively ﬁltered, and the true voltage values can be retained. The measured voltage values, as shown in Fig. 2(d), indicate that there are no obvious ﬂuctuations in the condition of constant-current loadings, such as Cycle 1 and Cycle 5. However, in Cycle 10, cell 1’s voltage endures obvious ﬂuc- tuations, and this becomes more evident with the continuing charging/discharging. Meanwhile, a nut is loosened. In Cycle 20, the voltage ﬂuctuation of cell 1 is far higher than that of the other three cells with sparks occurring, indicating that the wire connection between the batteries is losing and this wire connection fault is more and more severe. B. Introduction to the Prognosis Methods 1) FFT: FFT is a discipline that was ﬁrst proposed by Cully and Tukey [33]. It is the fast algorithm for discrete Fourier transform (DFT) operation, including the Fourier series and the Fourier Transformation. FFT is a reversible transform, that is, it allows conversion between the original signal and the transformed signal. However, this kind of transformation has only one kind of information available at any time. Because the frequency domain after FFT does not contain the original time information, the time information before the transformation cannot be obtained in the time domain after the inverse transformation. In fact, this phenomenon can be understood in combination with the formula of the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform can be divided into continuous Fourier transform and DFT. The formula for the continuous Fourier transform is F(w) = F[ f (t)]= ∫ ∞ −∞ f (t)e−iwt dt (2) f (t) = F −1[F(w)]= 1 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ F(w)eiwt dw.

(c) High-frequency signals after DWD. The formula for the DFT is X[k]= N −1∑ n=0 xne−i2π kn/N (4) xn = 1 N N −1∑ n=0 X[k]ei2π kn/N (5) where F(w) is the mirror function of f (t), f (t) is the original mirror function of F(w), X[k] represents the transformed data, xn is the sampled analog signal, and N is the number of sampling points. We can see that because the integral in the Fourier transform is from negative inﬁnity to positive inﬁnity, this integral is valid for all time classes, that is, the globality of the integral is affected no matter when the frequency component changes, and the same is true of the DFT, so this is why the FFT is usu- ally not suitable for analyzing nonstationary signals. Various parameters of a battery system, especially the fault signal, must be some nonstationary signals, so the FFT has no advantage in the frequency domain analysis of the battery system. For instance, we take Cycle 20 in the virtual connection failure as an example, and the discrete FFT result is shown in Fig. 3(a). From Fig. 3(a), we can see that whether in the low-frequency, intermediate-frequency, or high-frequency phases (which are, respectively, 0∼20, 400∼500, and 1015∼1024 HZ), the result of the time-frequency conversion actually makes the abnormal- ity of the virtual Cell 1 less obvious, that is, the FFT-based anomaly diagnosis is not effective. 2) DWD: Wavelet, as its name implies, is a small wave- form that has both volatility and attenuation characteristics. Compared with the Fourier transform, the wavelet transform has the following advantages: ﬁrst, it can analyze the local characteristics of the signals; second, it can simultaneously analyze the signals in the time and frequency domain; and third, it can analyze the nonstationary signal with effective noise reduction [34]. Furthermore, the wavelet transform can focus on any detail of the signal by using gradually ﬁne sampling steps for different frequency components, so it has good time-frequency localization characteristics and handles weak or abrupt signals. What needs to be emphasized is that it is especially suitable for signal analysis of the nonsteady-state distortion waveform problem. Arbitrary signal or function f (t) is deﬁned in the function space or signal space L 2(R), and the expansion in the con- tinuous wavelet base ϕ(α,τ )(t). WT f (α, τ ) is called continuous wavelet transform of f (t) WT f (α, τ ) = 1 √ |α| ∫ R f (t)ϕ(α,τ )dt (6) where ϕ(α,τ )(t) = 1 √ |α| ϕ( t − τ α ) (7) Cϕ = ∫ R ϕ(v) |v| dv< +∞. (8) The scale parameter α and translation parameter τ deter- mine the time-frequency characteristics of the wavelet trans- form. Because the coefﬁcients of the continuous wavelet transform are coupled and repetitive, they need to be further discretized in the actual application process, that is, the DWT and the discretized parameters, such as α and τ , are obtained. The steps in discrete mode are as follows. 1) Power-level discretization of scale parameter α α = αm 0 . (9) 2) Discretization of translation parameter τ τ = kαm 0 τ0 (10) where α> 0, τ> 0, m,and k are all integers. After the scale parameters and translation parameters are discretized, the discrete wavelet basis ϕαm 0 ,kτ0 and DWT WT f ( αm 0 , kτ0) can be obtained as follows: ϕαn 0 ,kτ0 = α− m 2 0 ϕ(α−m 0 t-kτ0) (11) WT f ( αm 0 , kτ0) = α− m 2 0 ∫ R f (t)ϕ(α−m 0 t-kτ0) dt. (12) The basis of the FFT is a sine–cosine function, while the basis of a wavelet transform is a wavelet of various shapes, that is, it treats the entire waveform as a superposition of wavelets with different positions and widths. The scale Authorized licensed use limited to: Louisiana State University. Downloaded on August 29,2023 at 23:55:50 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply. 94 IEEE JOURNAL OF EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 11, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2023 parameter α controls small expansion and contraction, and the translation parameter τ can control the wavelet translation. According to the above analysis, the FFT is not suitable for processing nonstationary signals and can only obtain a frequency spectrum, and the frequency-domain information only provides the waveform components but does not provide the component appearance order; therefore, the simple Fourier analysis has a poor resolution for nonstationary signals whose frequency varies with time. Wavelet analysis can obtain a time-frequency spectrum, including signal decomposition (i.e., wavelet decomposition) and reconstruction (i.e., wavelet transform). This makes wavelet analysis very suitable for analyzing nonstationary time series, such as real-world battery signals, in this study. Wavelet decomposition is to ﬁnd the best mapping from the actual signal space to the wavelet function space in order to obtain the best recovery of the original signal. The low-frequency and high-frequency signals obtained after the decomposition can perfectly restore the original signal by reconstruction, so it is widely used for denoising of various signals, such as images [35], [36]. In addition, the high-frequency and low-frequency components are obtained after wavelet decom- position. The low-frequency components obtained from the low-pass ﬁlter can be called “approximate components,” and the high-frequency components obtained from the high-pass ﬁlter can be called “detail components.” The position of the component corresponds to the original signal, so the signal after wavelet decomposition can perfectly reconstruct and locate the details in the original signal, and the coefﬁcients of each layer of the wavelet decomposition can be quantiﬁed by selecting an appropriate threshold. A mother wavelet is determined to build the high- and low-pass ﬁlters, and the input signal is convolved with the two ﬁlters formed, respectively, and then downsampled to obtain the approximation and detail coefﬁcients, which correspond to the low- and high-frequency coefﬁcients. The DWD can have many layers. The ﬁrst layer is the decomposition of the signal into two parts, low-frequency information and high-frequency information, by wavelet analy- sis. The low-frequency information is the slow-changing part, which is the outline of the change in the data and accounts for most of the total information; the high-frequency information is the fast-changing part, which reﬂects the detailed informa- tion of the signals and accounts for a small part of the total information. On the basis of the ﬁrst layer, the high-frequency information can be decomposed further into low-frequency and high-frequency parts, and the third layer is to decompose the high-frequency information from the second layer into low-frequency and high-frequency parts, and so on. The above is a single-scale decomposition, and the low-frequency part is not decomposed again. In the case of multiscale decomposi- tion, the low-frequency part is decomposed one layer at a time, just like the high-frequency part. In this study, we use only one layer of decomposition. Cycle 20 in the virtual connection failure is still taken as the processing object, the DWD results of in low frequency and high frequency are shown in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3(b), we can see that the low-frequency signal after wavelet decomposition basically retains the characteristics of the original signals. The high-frequency signal, as shown in Fig. 3(c), can effectively display the location and amplitude of the abnormal signals and sudden changes of Cell 1. Therefore, we will further explore the processing effect of DWD on actual vehicle data under more complicated dynamic conditions. IV. NDWD-BASED FAULT PROGNOSIS FOR A REAL-WORLD VEHICLE A. Introduction to the Thermal Runaway Accident Vehicle accidents caused by battery thermal runaways have been reported around the world in recent years, and the safety of EVs has received great attention from governments, vehicle manufacturers, and researchers. The safety concerns of EVs, if not resolved in a timely manner, will reduce con- sumer conﬁdence in buying and trigger depression in the new energy vehicle market. The studied vehicle data come from the National Monitoring and Management Platform for EVs (NMMP-EV), which has been able to monitor and manage more than three million new energy vehicles across China in real time. Besides, the platform not only carries out statistical analysis work on monitored vehicles but also performs fault management for battery systems. The monitoring and manage- ment mechanism of the NMMP-EV Platform is demonstrated in Fig. 4(a). At present, the vehicle data containing battery thermal runaway accidents has been connected to the platform, in the hope that through accident investigation and further research to explore the cause of the accident and develop the real-time prognosis function for battery fault or thermal runaway for real-world EVs. The studied vehicle is a pure EV with a spontaneous combustion accident that occurred in the second half of 2019 (based on corporate privacy, the following accident time and some other information have been desensitized). Spontaneous combustion occurs after driving a mileage after being fully charged on the accident day. The car is equipped with a ternary lithium battery pack with 91 single cells assembled in series using soft pack laminations. Fig. 4(b) shows the schematic of the distribution and different damage locations of the studied battery pack. A and B represent the rear and front of the battery pack, C and D are the right and left sides of the battery pack. It can be seen from Fig. 4(b) that the right and rear parts of the battery pack are basically intact after the accident, but the front part is perforated, and the other parts on the left are basically intact but seriously damaged at about 1/3 position. The battery voltage curves of 15 days before the thermal runaway are shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5, the car was charged only once on the accident day, and a thermal runaway occurred just a few minutes after it started driving. The voltages of Cell 9, Cell 7, and Cell 13 ﬁrst dropped rapidly, and then Cell 23, Cell 19, and Cell 5 also gradually dropped. This also reﬂects the starting position and diffusion direction of the thermal runaway, which is consistent with the cell distri- bution in Fig. 4(b) (Cell 7 and Cell 13 are both concentrated near Cell 9). In addition, we found that during the 15 days before the thermal runaway occurred, the car underwent Authorized licensed use limited to: Louisiana State University.

Platform and incident descriptions. (a) Monitoring and management mechanism of the NMMP-EV platform. (b) Distribution and different damage locations of the studied battery pack. Fig. 5. Battery voltage curves before the accident. about 20 driving/charging cycles with different depths, and the voltages ﬂuctuations during the charging phase and the driving phase were signiﬁcantly different. In addition, after 13:22:56 AM on the day before the accident, a short-time sharp voltage ﬂuctuation occurred while the vehicle was driving. It is important to emphasize that this mutation may be caused by various reasons, such as the sudden deterioration of the health status of the studied battery system before it is close to thermal runaway, some unexpected operation situations, data acquisition error, or too rough data preprocessing. However, even if there are some errors in the collected data, there only is an inﬂuence on the authenticity of the original data of the studied vehicle, but no interference to the effectiveness of the proposed method and the generality of the application object. Because the voltage characteristics between the charging state and the driving state during the actual vehicle operation are extremely different, we divide the actual vehicle operation data into driving data and charging data, and select some speciﬁc date of charging/driving data for analysis. Fig. 6(a) shows the 1-h charging voltage curves on the accident day, Fig. 6. Charging/driving voltage curves before the accident. (a) Charging voltage curves of three days before the accident. (b) Driving voltage curves of four days before the accident. six days before the accident, and 15 days before the accident. Fig. 6(b) shows the 1-h driving voltage curves one day, three days, seven days, and 15 days before the accident, respectively (there is only a small amount of charging data without driving data on the accident day and six days before the accident). Fig. 6(a) shows that the ﬂuctuations of all the cell voltages in the three charging conditions are very smooth and the consistency is very good. Fig. 6(b) demonstrates that the cell voltages in the four groups of driving conditions have very sharp ﬂuctuations due to the complex driving conditions. Moreover, one day, three days, and seven days before the accident, especially one day before the thermal runaway accident, Cell 7, Cell 9, and Cell 13, have more obvious abnormal ﬂuctuations than other cells. This is consistent with the accident investigation results in Figs. 4(b) and 5. However, the ﬂuctuations of all cell voltages are still within the time- domain-based safety threshold; therefore, it is difﬁcult to accurately diagnose these abnormal cells with conventional methods.

NDWD-Based Fault Prognosis Strategy Fig. 7(a) and (b) are the high-frequency components of the DWDs of the above-mentioned three charging phases and four driving phases. Fig. 7(a) indicates that the DWD curves of all cell voltages in different charging phases have small ﬂuctuations and good consistency, which corresponds to the voltage curves in Fig. 6(a). Due to the dynamic variability of driving conditions, the DWD curves in the four driving phases before the accident in Fig. 7(b) have sharp ﬂuctuations. There are abnormal ﬂuctuations in Cell 7 and Cell 9 three days and seven days before the accident, respectively; Cell 7, Cell 9, and Cell 13 have obvious abnormal ﬂuctuations one day before the accident, which are also matched with the voltage curves in Fig. 6(b). Therefore, the proposed DWD method is very promising to effectively and stably diagnose the cells with abnormal voltages. Based on the above analysis, we can ﬁnd that the char- acteristics of battery voltages and DWDs are very different due to different operating conditions between the charging and driving phases. Taking advantage of the big-data-based empir- ical methods of actual vehicles from the NMMP-EV platform, aiming at the operating characteristics of EVs, we developed a multilevel NDWD-based prognosis strategy combined with the normalization method. Through veriﬁcation of a large number of real-world vehicle data and the trial-error method, anomaly coefﬁcient thresholds for driving and charging states are correspondingly obtained, as shown in Fig. 8. However, the DWD values of different battery types under different driving conditions are not ﬁxed within a certain range. In order to obtain the thresholds of the abnormal coefﬁcients with generality, the DWDs under the driving state are normalized from the beginning, then the ﬁrst-level alarm threshold Td1 = 0.8 and the second-level warning threshold Td2 = 0.6 are determined. Besides, the vehicle always works in a stable and good-consistency state under the charging state; therefore, a generic abnormal coefﬁcient threshold is determined as Tc =±0.015. Through extensive veriﬁcation of actual vehicle data, the determined thresholds perform great versatility and diagnostic accuracy. The rules for making anomaly coefﬁcients are as follows. 1) The anomaly coefﬁcient under driving state is DWDd−nor = |DWDd| − ∣ ∣DWDd− min∣ ∣ ∣ ∣DWDd− max∣ ∣ − ∣ ∣DWDd− min∣ ∣ (13) A D = DWDd−nor − DWDd−ave (14) where DWDd− min is the minimum DWD of cell voltage, DWDd− min is the maximum DWD of cell voltage, DWDd−nor is DWD after normalization, DWDd−ave is the average DWD of cell voltage, and A D is the driving anomaly coefﬁcient. 2) The anomaly coefﬁcient under charging state is AC = DWDc − DWDc−ave (15) where DWDc−ave is the average DWD of cell voltage, and AC is the charging anomaly coefﬁcient. V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Based on the abnormal coefﬁcients set earlier, we performed veriﬁcation on the studied vehicle. The abnormal coefﬁcient curves of three charging states and four driving states are obtained, as shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b), respectively. Fig. 9(a) shows that the three sets of charging anomaly coefﬁcients are always between −0.015 and 0.015, that is, the battery system is in a safe charging state; this is consistent with the charging voltage characteristics in Fig. 9(a). Fig. 9(b) indicates that all cells are safe 15 days before the accident; the abnormality coefﬁcients of Cell 7 and Cell 9 exceed the second-level warn- ing threshold three days and seven days before the accident, respectively; Cell 7, Cell 9, and Cell 13 reach or exceed the ﬁrst-level alarm threshold one day before the accident, when is very close to the occurrence of battery thermal runaway the next day. Therefore, based on the NDWD-based multilevel prognosis strategy, the abnormal Cell 9 can be detected and isolated at least seven days before the thermal runaway acci- dent according to a second-level warning.

(b) Driving anomaly coefﬁcients of four days before the accident. through reasonable and early inspection, repair, or replacement of abnormal cells, the thermal runaway accident can be timely avoided to safeguard the drivers and passengers. At present, the accident data of new energy vehicle accidents are still in the conﬁdential stage, and the quality of the actual vehicle operation data is often very poor, so it is very difﬁcult to obtain effective research data, and it is even rarer and valuable to ﬁnd accidents caused by an external short circuit. In the near future, we will mainly carry out two aspects of work. On the one hand, based on the NMMP-EV platform, we will collect more data from accident vehicles caused by an external short circuit to further verify the feasibility and stability of the proposed method. On the other hand, we will collect data from accidents caused by other reasons, such as internal short circuits, overcharging, and so on, to verify the robustness and universality of the proposed method. VI. CONCLUSION This article presented a real-time prognosis and isolation scheme for battery faults based on the NDWD algorithm, which can effectively extract battery fault signals at an early stage. The high-frequency detail components of wavelet decomposition are used to extract the frequency-domain char- acteristics of the early fault signals. The veriﬁcation results of experimental-based battery connection faults showed that the proposed method can effectively extract and locate the early hidden fault signals within the conventional time- domain-based threshold range. In addition, considering the different characteristics of the driving state and charging state of the battery system during actual vehicle operation, a multilevel fault prognosis strategy is developed based on the NDWD. The veriﬁcation results of a real vehicle with a thermal runaway accident show that the proposed prognosis strategy can effectively detect and locate fault cells seven days before the thermal runaway is triggered. Through reasonable inspection, repair, or replacement measures, battery thermal runaway can be avoided early, thereby safeguarding the drivers and passengers. Moreover, the reliability and stability of the method have been veriﬁed through the veriﬁcation of multiple sets of real-world vehicle data. More importantly, this is an innov- ative battery fault prognosis research performed on an actual accident vehicle, proving its practical potential in the safety management of real-world battery systems.
