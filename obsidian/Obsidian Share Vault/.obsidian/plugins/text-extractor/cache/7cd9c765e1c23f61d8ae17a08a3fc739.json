Our last episode was with Faiz Shakir , Bernie Sanders’s former campaign manager. And it was about the question of whether Bernieism was a way forward for theDemocratic Party. But I said at the beginning that I was going to make that a pairing, that we’re going to have two very different perspectives on whatDemocrats should do next. So here is the other. And it is, as I promised, very different. Rahm Emanuel isAmerica’s ambassador to Japan. Before that, he was mayor of Chicago, but it’s what he did before that that interests me. Emanuel was Barack Obama’s chief of staff inthe first two years of Obama’s first term. This was when Obama passed the stimulus bill, the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. Archived clip of Barack Obama: It’s fair to say that we could not have accomplished what we’ve accomplished without Rahm’s leadership. Archived clip of Rahm Emanuel: You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that, it’s an opportunity to do things that you think youcould not do before. And before that, Emanuel led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in2006. This was the midterm elections following George W. Bush’s re-election in 2004. And Emanuel masterminded the campaign that won the House back for Democratsfor the first time in 12 years. Archived clip of Katie Couric: Americans voted for a change in the last election, and today we got it. The new 110th Congress convened with the Democrats in charge of both houses for the first time in 12 years. And for thefirst time ever, a woman is speaker of the House. Archived clip of Rahm Emanuel: From every corner of the country, the American people have sent a resounding and unmistakable message of change and new direction for America. And before that, Emanuel was one of Bill Clinton’s top advisers and top fund-raisers. Archived clip of Rahm Emanuel: There’s an old saying that if you want to make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs. The American people were hungry for leadership. And I’m proud that in providing that leadership, President Clintonbroke a few eggs. Here’s what you cannot take away from him: He has been at the center of most ofthe biggest Democratic victories, both electoral and legislative, since the ’90s. The people who love him in the party — and there are many — they say: What thisguy knows is how to win. And having lost in 2024, Democrats want to win. And so Emanuel’s name is popping up a lot. David Axelrod, Obama’s former chiefstrategist, said that Emanuel should be the next Democratic National Committee chair. Steve Israel, a former top House Democrat, he said the same. Emanuel andhis allies are clearly pushing him back into the frame. There’s a campaign going on right now. But there are a lot of detractors too. Emanuel is a very controversial figure in the party. There are large factions that see the Clinton and Obama eras as goodfor Bill Clinton and Barack Obama but not that good for Democrats down ballot. And Emanuel is not from the wing of the party that believes the American public iswaiting for democratic socialism. He’s from the wing of the party that believes Democrats are often out of touch,that they listen to what gets said in the faculty lounge and dismiss what gets said on the street corner. That the most important thing Democrats have to do inany election, particularly a congressional election, is demonstrate — through the candidates they run, things they say and the things they choose not to say — thatthey’re listening to the people they claim to represent. I’ve said before that I think the analogue to be thinking about after 2024 is 2004. The last time aRepublican president who won his first term by losing the popular vote got elected again in much more convincing fashion. And Rahm Emanuel was a guy, after that 2004drubbing, who led the Democratic comeback in 2006. So I wanted to have him on the show. What did he learn in that campaign? And whatdoes he think Democrats should do now? Ezra Klein: Let’s just start here. Why do you think the Democrats lost in 2024? Rahm Emanuel: I mean, look, at a certain level, when 70 percent of the country thinks the economy is bad and, by equal measure, 70 percent think the country’s headed in the wrong direction, that is a structural equation for an anti-incumbent election. Then there’s, I think, a second part, which takes understanding, and that is the top of the ticket performs worse than the congressional wing, which is not thenorm. And then there’s kind of this moment in time — and you can look at other places where you and I are sitting here when a right-winger just went to the topin the Romanian election — people call it populism. I actually call it anti- establishment. And then I dial my clock all the way back, Ezra. Look, I think there’s two seminal moments that explain the last 20-plus years in American politics. One, the Iraq war, where the American people were deceived intoa war of choice. We lost thousands of young men and women. Thousands of young men and women are maimed for life. And we spent a trillion dollars in a failedendeavor and a war of choice. And we’re lied to, and nobody — and I mean nobody — is ever held accountable. Six years later, the financial industry, housing crash, near depression, people lose not their lives like in the Iraq war, but they lose their livelihood, theirhomes. So you have people losing lives, livelihood, and the elite and the top of thesociety totally unaccountable and never act like they did anything wrong. People out of the foreign policy establishment — they’re on boards, institutions,universities, bankers yelling for their bonuses, and the American people are fed up. And then you fast-forward through Covid, and I think that what happens is the Democrats go — in the prior years, President Obama, the ’06 elections, etc. — fromanti-establishment to the establishment and the elite, with the whole way we dealt with Covid, the way we dealt with science and talked to people. And I think that is a deeper current. It’s unique to the United States. The first two examples — not totally the financial. And to me, that explains a lot of what Icall the anti-Brussels, anti-Washington. You say no one was ever held accountable, but that’s passive voice. You all neverheld anyone accountable. Totally. The administration that comes after the Iraq war and the financial crisis is the Obama administration. You’re the first chief of staff. Who was going to do it ifnot you? That’s what I was going to tell you. There’s a famous — in about March, after the stimulus — it’s a very fair question, because we were having this debate after wepassed children’s health insurance, Lilly Ledbetter legislation and the stimulus bill and a number of other things on national service and protecting kids ontobacco — we have this big Saturday debate. President Obama had three major initiatives: cap and trade, health care reform andfinancial reform. And this is generic, at 10,000 feet — everybody, there’s nuances — we have a massive debate. The domestic side of it said that you got to getstarted on health care right now. It has to be first because every day you lose on health care to do it, you’re not going to get there. Not wrong about thelegislative politics. The economic team worried that if you push financial reform first, the banks won’t lend, and it will hold the economy back. I was arguing for Old Testament justice. It’s been written about, just taking a banker in the middle. Of the public square and literally beating the hell out ofthem through financial reform because they, this system, the society needed not only the catharsis, but we needed not only legislatively reforms, but I think thewhole system needed somebody to be held accountable. And my argument about financial reform was the bankers would be on the other side fighting you — thefinancial industry. In health care, to get it done — and there’s a memo to this effect — you’re goingto need the health care industry — the lessons out of the Clinton administration — on your side of the table. The interest groups that had to be brought over orneutralized. And that was a big debate, and President Obama — you weigh kind of using the clock for health care or the fear about the economy, and you have toweigh these equities and never 100 percent. And you’re right. And — not a banker and not a foreign policy establishment person— that kind of populism we talk about, I refer to as anti-establishment and anti- elite. And then the Democrats in ’06, ’08 win and because not only the type ofcandidates, the quality of candidates but also because we were against what the establishment had done. I think we don’t realize how Covid flipped the script and we become the establishment, we become the elite, and there’s a series of other things that areadditive to it. And you’re not wrong to raise that question. I think there’s a political price to pay that, literally, when we were doing financial reform afterhealth care, bankers are yelling about their bonuses, they deserve bonuses, Washington shouldn’t tell them, and we’re bailing the industry out, to the tune of$800 billion, and in those days, that was a big number. So you’re not wrong on that level. Can you really channel anti-elite or anti-establishment sentiment through the people of the establishment? And look, I’m talking to you. You’re a former WhiteHouse chief of staff. You’re the ambassador to Japan. You’ve worked in finance. You’ve worked for presidents. You have led the Democratic Congressional CampaignCommittee. There can be a tendency to say that there’s an anti-establishment mood andDemocrats need to pick that up, but does that mean a personnel changeover? Your brother is a major health adviser and was a significant voice, Zeke Emanuel,during the pandemic, your other brother runs William Morris Endeavor. When we talk about an anti-establishment mood, is it something that then requiresa new generation of figures to channel that? Well, that’s kind of a self-interested question from here, so yes and no. In theshort answer, I mean, you look at Donald Trump, and he’s captured — I would not call the president-elect, by any imagination, an authentic voice of populism, yethe has sold himself as that person, and he does it not just on economic basis: I will be your instrument of your revenge. And he’s not — it just has to beauthentic. He’s not exactly character A that you would point to, and I can give you the characters or individuals, rather, not characters, in Europe, etc., thatalso don’t — quote, unquote — fit that mold that you’re talking about and yet still have a voice that people attach to. That may tell you the depth of theiranger, that they’ll look past a lot of contradictions to get there. Fair question, but then I go back to when I was Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairin 2006. I can’t tell you how many times I got told by members of the caucus, the peopleyou’re recruiting at that time — these were veterans of the Iraq Afghanistan war, members of the intelligence community, national security apparatus, sheriffs,football players, different people, small-business owners. And they said: Well, these aren’t real Democrats. I said, well, they’re not. They actually reflect, as every election does, but the election has a story and narrative behind it. They reflect this moment in time,and they are real Democrats. They may not come out of your mold, but they reflect the reality of their congressional district, which I think tells that story. So part of the biography has to be authentic, but it’s not 100 percent an explanation for electoral or policy success. It’s a core piece, no doubt. And I think the feeling has to be authentic. And we’re talking for two reasons, but one reason is one night, a few weeks ago, I’m sitting in my chair reading, andI get a call from a number I don’t recognize, and I pick it up, and it’s you. And with a lot of fury, you start telling me that you just feel Democrats have lost their way — you can say what you want to say from the conversation — but one thing you said that has been in my mind is that there were lessons in the Bill Clintonera, lessons in the Barack Obama era that you feel the Democratic Party has tossed aside. That there’s, on the one hand — I think you’re right — an anti-establishment mood that the Democrats in the Biden and the Harris era did not channel and could noteven speak to. But on the other hand, one of the things you have been saying publicly, and I think privately, is that there has also been a throwing overboardof what you see as both institutional and political wisdom that I think you understand yourself as a vessel for helping the Democratic Party, but back infront. So tell me what that wisdom is. Well, let me get one thing off — this is like therapy, so let me get one thing off my chest. That’s podcasts. Do you take Blue Cross Blue Shield? No therapist does. That’s the problem. I mean, think about it. The harshest criticism of President Clinton and PresidentObama’s tenure comes from Democrats. Fact: Bill Clinton, first Democrat to get re-elected since Franklin DelanoRoosevelt. That’s a fact. Second, from 1968 to 1988, 20-year run, outside of Jimmy Carter, the Republicans run the presidency, and they run on law and order underRichard Nixon, welfare queens under Ronald Reagan and Willie Horton under George Herbert Walker Bush. Bill Clinton, from Arkansas, comes along and solves the riddle of these holes, what we would call cultures, but crime, drugs, immigration and welfare. Now we cango through the policies, argue certain things, but he not only gets re-elected, which is one measure of success, but he also sets in a period of time — I thinkit’s six out of the last seven presidential elections — Democrats win a majority of votes. I’m not saying he’s totally responsible for it, but it sets a pattern. And rather than learn the lesson of how we solved a 20-year problem for the party that hadweighed on Michael Dukakis, weighed on every other candidate prior to that, we totally shunt his presidency aside. The people that study it are the Republicans. They learn from it. Now, the same thing, President Obama, through both talking about his community service in working with steelworkers and communities, how he then addressed saving both Chrysler and G.M. and the auto industry and not just the industry and the jobs but the communities that relied on that single plant ina Youngstown, Ohio, or in a Rockford, Ill., or in a Saginaw or Flint, Mich., and he could relate to it. And we say, “Oh, well, that economic recovery was just so low and small. It wasn’t big. It wasn’t bold.” Won Ohio, got re-elected, passed major health care. Youdon’t do 100 percent. And we look at this, and then you can take this election, and we’re not only losing working-class whites. We’re losing working-class Blacksand Hispanics. And it is under a tenure of a president who, clearly, most pro-labor presidentsince either John Kennedy or Harry S. Truman. And I’ve said this to you privately — I’ve said it publicly — there is more to people than the collection of theirwallet and their checkbook. They care about where their kids go to school. They care about whether theirwives, spouses or partners or children can drive a car without being carjacked, and yelling at people, “Well, crime is coming down,” doesn’t work. Let me tell yousomething, as a former mayor: Nobody walks around going, “You know what? I feel 22 percent safer in 2024 than I did in 2023.” Crime’s a feeling, a sense of a — a place of mind. And rather than telling people, “You don’t see the data,” which is how we come off, we should be saying, “Here’sour agenda to ensure that we keep reducing crime. And here’s what we’re going to do next. We’re going to work on carjacking, car thefts,” which is actually goingup, not coming down. Now think about this. Pre-Covid — is another example of an issue and where I thinkour party goes wrong — pre-Covid, Democrats historically run somewhere between a 15-to-22-point advantage on education. From Covid forward, the only two things youhear from Democrats on education is: We’re going to shut the school down. We’re going to close the front door of the school, and after Covid, we’re going to blowopen the bathroom school door. That’s it. Not what you’re going to do on math, not what you’re going to do onreading, what you’re going to do to drive graduation. And now what is the net result? Not only are parents pulling kids out of public schools; we’re barelybreaking even on the issue of education. And a president is running for election saying: I’m going to shut down theDepartment of Education. And we don’t have a credible voice or a credible box to stand on. We took a singular issue that we were the voice on, and Republicans were20 points behind us on, on average, and we’ve lost it all. And we don’t even look at: Why is it? We were very strong pro-labor as a party. Joe Biden gets credit for that. We lost working-class votes. And these are parents. They live in a community. They sendtheir kids to school. They send their kids to a park facility, a library. They’re driving in their community. We don’t actually — in the name of fighting forworking class — we don’t actually hear them. We don’t listen to them. We tell them how to eat their peas. It’s hard for me to hear you say that and not think these are also lessons from your mayorship, which is not really where I want to focus on in this conversation,but a lot of the angriest criticism of you was around shutting down schools and what those schools meant to communities. Did that change your sense of what it means when a school is not functioning, what a school means in a place? No, I mean, there’s no, look, it was an angry part. I mean, I talk about it, and we did things like drive our graduation rate up, but that was the hardest, one ofthe hardest decisions I made as a mayor. You had schools that were built for 800 with 200 or less kids, and it wasincredibly hard because it was not just a school; it was an anchor in the community. Not only couldn’t you afford it, but the kids, the schools were —three, four, five, six, seven years in a row — failing. And the school meant something emotionally, physically, and I get it. Very tough. But I think what’s tougher: letting a kid, because it was politically hard, stay in a failing school. At the end of the day, eight years later, while other mayorshave opposed what I did, they haven’t opened up the schools. One of the measures of success you mentioned with both Clinton and Obama, and Ithink correctly, is re-election. Let me say one thing. I don’t mean to interrupt you, sir. I made that decision inmy first term and got re-elected. I’m not saying it was easy, but there is a measure there on both the academic side and the political side. Well, that actually sets up what I’m going to ask, which is one of the measures you’ve mentioned here is re-election, right? For Clinton, for Obama. And onecritique you hear of both of them is that, yes, they got re-elected, but under them, the Democratic Party down ballot got annihilated. So under Clinton,Democrats lose the House for the first time in 40 years. Under Barack Obama, huge wipeout in 2010, very, very rough elections in 2014. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has made a version of this argument against you that, yes, what they were able to do was successfully manage their own political capital, but they were not able to build a strong and healthy Democratic Party. And one of the reasons the Democratic Party subsequently turned on their brands ofpolitics, more so on Clinton than Obama, in my view — obviously, Joe Biden was Obama’s vice president — is that the party felt that what they did worked for thembut not for the future of the Democratic Party. There’s a legitimacy to her observation and a conclusion. I don’t think itexplains everything, and I don’t think it’s 100 percent accurate, but it’s a valid critique. One, you already start, under Ronald Reagan, seeing what are calledReagan Democrats, that movement, and the South, which had been a bastion for Democrats that we remembered, was shifting earlier than President Clinton. But itwas a wipeout, and it doesn’t explain everything. I had disagreements with Bill Clinton. He thinks it was the assault weapon ban. I don’t think it was passing theassault weapon ban that caused the loss. President Clinton and I have — having been responsible for seeing that legislation through — had a 20-year runningdebate on whether the assault weapon ban was responsible for ’94. And he does get re-elected, and Democrats do make gains, and by the way, in 1998,he breaks a 100-year kind of norm, which is in the sixth year, a presidency just gets blown out. Actually, the Democrats pick up House seats. So her critique isnot wrong, but it’s not 100 percent accurate to what happened. It’s more kind of devastating what happens, from a Democrat’s, when PresidentObama is done. I think we had the lowest House and legislative seats in about 100 years. I do think American politics is fundamentally different — this is my view,other people can argue — after the war and the financial meltdown. It’s never getting above — you can’t get a president today above 60 percent. Youcan’t get — you know, right track, wrong track has been politicized. Economic sense, a right track, wrong track, in the sense of the direction of the country,economic sentiment about whether the economy is healthy or not healthy has been politicized, and the legitimacy and delegitimacy of Washington is in a placethat’s different than it was pre-2000. Now, to the effect on the party, a lot of efforts under President Obama are tobuild outside the party, not inside the party infrastructure, and that has its own consequences as well. And so it’s a critique, and as I’ve already said, it’ssomewhat accurate but somewhat inaccurate. Because I do think — as you start, from Bill Clinton’s election forward — did create on a national level a favorableenvironment for Democrats because he finally took what we call this bag of issues, this cultural set of issues, and took them off the Democratic back and allowed usto get heard on a whole host of economic issues that we hadn’t been heard on before. This then gets to the other reason I wanted to have you on the show, which is, after 12 years, the person who wins the House back is you. You’re the chair of theD.C.C.C. in the 2006 elections, which is a huge, huge Democratic wave victory. And I’ve been thinking a lot about 2004, which is maybe where I want to start, because2004, to me, felt the most, for Democrats, like 2024 of anything, at least in my memory. George W. Bush — it was known by then that the Iraq war was sold on lies. It was known by then that the Iraq war was proving to be a disaster. There’s a sense thatwho Bush was hadn’t been fully understood in 2000. He was an accidental president. There were butterfly ballots in Florida. He had lost the popular vote. And then in ’04, when it is known, when the consequences of his policies are, seemingly, more clear, at least to liberals, he wins in a much more decisivefashion. And the day after, there’s a huge backlash against and inside the Democratic Party that feels very similar to today. Democrats have lost touch withthe heartland is one of the arguments. They have been too liberal on gay marriage. There were these gay marriage ballotinitiatives that were partially blamed for their loss. There’s a sense that Democrats need to moderate. They need to move to the center. They need to regain aconnection to an America that they no longer know or understand. And there’s not just a confusion but a sense of alienation. That’s, at least, howI would describe it. But let me ask you how you understood the 2004 election when it happened. 2004 felt more like a gut punch, really, to the solar plexus because everything else you could kind of explain away. 2002, the Republicans win in a midterm: firstelections post-9/11. You could explain that. 2000, you can say the U.S. Supreme Court cheated the Florida Supreme Court from doing their responsibility and made adecision — quote, unquote — only for this one case. To me, that was illegitimate. By 2004, winning an election outright, no more trying to explain away a problem.And in 2004, you can sit there and play out how John Kerry ran the idea that you could take a guy like President Bush, who skirted on his own responsibilities withthe National Guard, and yet John Kerry serves in Vietnam, serves his country, puts on the uniform, etc. — part of his whole not just biography but his politicallegitimacy — and turns out to be seen as weak on national security. And you can argue President Bush illegitimately attacked his character and his service. Ithink when you look back at the campaign, then-Senator Kerry totally mismanaged his campaign. Talking about, like, on Iraq: “I was for it before I was againstit.” Just major things that become character references and character points to him. So the way I look at 2004 is my conversation with Nancy Pelosi when she calls to askme, literally the first week afterward, to run the D.C.C.C. for ’06 elections. And I think that ’04, there was no more hiding and making excuses to ourselves what wehad lost. You couldn’t use the 2000, you know, 500 ballots in Florida, not legitimate, etc.We had lost three elections in a row, and there was a fundamental problem, both on the quality of the people we were putting forward and the message we were puttingforward. When you say we were it — Democrats. This is one of the questions I think is interesting about ’04, and maybe it’s anoverly optimistic one for Democrats to look at, because Republicans then — Karl Rove said quite a lot in this direction — believed they were building arealignment. They believed they were building a permanent majority of some kind. They thought that 2004 foretold a reshaping of American politics. And two yearslater, and then four years later, it doesn’t look anything like that. And the fear that Democrats have lost touch and need to become — I don’t exactlywant to say Republican lite, but I do want to say Republican lite — is also not their path back to victory. No, that’s not. I mean — I’m not saying you’re saying that. I’m saying that was a very common piece ofpunditry. Let me say this. There are issues in which you want to sand down the difference sothere isn’t a difference. And the reason you want to is to move them to your favorable terrain. But there’s a reason I went out and recruited candidates on thenational security front. If you’re going to flip a Republican district, you’re going to take all these cultural issues because the biography told a story. They had a legitimacy based on their experience, and their story, their biography, their life’s work made that swing voter culturally comfortable. That created aspace for then the rest of the story to get told. We both had an agenda that differed with President Bush, and I would — just, for the record, last time theminimum wage got raised was right after ’06 elections. There was an actual strategic plan, both on the policy side and on the candidaterecruitment side, and it was a hand in glove. And yes, I got — I mean, you can go back, I think you and I started to get to know each other — I was getting pummeled. I wasn’t recruiting “real” Democrats — football players, sheriffs, people that worked in the Air Force, armed forces of this country, foughtoverseas. There were other people — small business owners — all types of people wererecruited. Why? Because there was a connectivity between the voters in that district that was, and you got to go back. Those districts were created to be afirewall against Democrats. They were created — they were little gerrymandered, so you couldn’t pick the lock. We picked the lock with candidates in districts that you were not supposed to be able to do it. Now it is the sixth year of president, very unpopular war, and weprosecuted the war. And the war was built on building blocks of deception, and it was a repudiation in the sixth year of President Bush’s presidency. And then — we shouldn’t forget this — in ’04 they did think, Karl Rove and others, that they were building a lasting coalition realigning politics. And they overshotthe runway on Social Security. He never mentions it, and then comes the first thing he’s going to do is: I have a mandate for Social Security. Well, bring it on. Let’s go. Because it drew the contrast where you wanted the terrain to be on your side, and we minimized the terrain on their side. That’s howyou develop a strategy. And not only did we win 30 seats in ’06; we went back and won more seats in ’08 in the presidential year and followed a similar playbook. And in 2018, it was replicated again in the first midterm of President Trump’s first term. That can that candidate recruitment, the issues you focus on, how you,kind of, where you move to shift the campaign story line to the most favorable terrain. It’s not different than what President Clinton did by addressing the setof cultural issues. It’s not different than what President Obama did in prosecuting both against MittRomney and then against John McCain in ’08. There are certain issues. You differentiate, and you have clear contrast in the certain issues in which youdon’t. That’s how you run a campaign. If you were thinking about that for right now — and we haven’t seen the secondTrump administration begin. We haven’t seen it take shape. We don’t know if there will be an analog to Social Security privatization — OK, I got this question, because I’ve been thinking. Yes. What, as you sit up at night — As Henry Kissinger used to say: Does anybody have questions for my answers? Yes, I have. Here is what frustrates me. Donald Trump, I do agree, that President Trump — I keep doing that, I should, he’s President-elect Trump — is a threat to democracy.We have those voters on “Hello.” If they think, that the issue of threat to democracy, threat to the rule of law — if they’re not a yes by now, they’re nevergoing to be a yes. We had them on “Hello.” Donald Trump is going to turn the Oval Office into eBay. He is going to sell it toevery special interest, and you’re going to be left paying that tab. And the Democratic Party is the thin blue line between the pharmaceutical industry gettingeverything they want or you paying everything you have. The Democratic Party is a thin blue line that will protect your kids from TikTok.And the Oval Office will become eBay. And whoever pays the highest price will get what they want, and you’ll be left paying through the nose. We should have turned what people think — this is what polling and focus groups are about. They do have a view of President Trump. Both his character and hisstrengths, his weaknesses. We never prosecuted the case of how his — not just character but how he’s going to run the Oval Office. And he did it. He used tosay: Oh, they give me lots of money. I’m going to give them — like the oil and gas industry: They give me a billion dollars. I’m going to give them all the cuts andregulations. He has a very funny line on this with Elon Musk. He says: I didn’t like electricvehicles, but now Elon Musk supports me, so I got to. He was against TikTok before he was for it. And your kids are going to becontrolled by the Chinese. We never prosecuted what the Oval Office is going to look like under Donald Trump and how much you’re going to pay for it. We prosecute — to give you an example: Take what I think President Biden did successfully, which is get the ability to negotiate pharmaceutical prices down andnegotiate with the pharmaceutical industry, and you got lower prices on insulin. We wanted to talk about the benefit we did. No. It should have been: The first president who took the pharmaceutical industry and beat the living crap out of them. And if we’re not there, the thin blue line,you’re going to go back to paying right through the nose. And President Trump, as you, just by example, oil and gas industry, E.V.s with Elon Musk, TikTok, it was atarget-rich environment, and we left it. We ran around democracy and the rule of law — which I agree with. But guess what? We had those voters. It was the other ones we needed. We talked about what made us feel so good about ourselves. Like we’re all — this is theother thing. I mean, now I really do hope you take Blue Cross Blue Shield, because I got to get this off. It’s like, think about this, as a party — not just that we didn’t prosecute the case that was fully present and actually fits with what people are worried about about Donald Trump — we talked about what we cared about,not what they wanted to hear. But also think about how we talk about any issue as a party. This is what drivesme crazy. Take the caring economy. I have never met anybody who’s described themselves in the caring economy. I’ve met social workers. I’ve met day careworkers. I’ve met nurses, R.N.s. I’ve never met anybody who says, “I’m in the caring economy,” but we talked about it. When you attack people — and I say this, my uncle was a police officer, etc. — “defund the police,” and they said, “Well, it doesn’t mean that,” well, then don’tuse the English language. If it doesn’t mean what you said it was, don’t use the English language. Start speaking in Japanese, French, but don’t say what you justsaid and then tell me it doesn’t mean that. “Latinx\" and people that it’s supposed to appeal to — it doesn’t represent them.We talk about people of color. Anybody who’s been a mayor in a big city knows that doesn’t exist. We use language to feel good about ourselves, not to communicate.We all think we’re applying to be adjunct professors at a small liberal arts college. We come off exactly like who we are. It’s insane. And the case against Donald Trump — now, again, I want to be honest, I’ve been in Tokyo for three years —pretty clear, it wasn’t democracy and the rule of law. After the last eight years he’s been in the public life, that was apparent. And everything that was — all thegold that you could have gotten out of that, you had. It was the other piece of the story that actually mattered to people’spocketbooks. And he will — and you can see by the cabinet that President-elect Trump is putting together — he will turn the Oval Office not only to the specialinterests, who President Biden fought, whether it was on oil and gas, whether it was pharmaceutical prices, took on every one of those special interests who hadhad control of Washington. He broke their hold. And Donald Trump is going to let them back in. And not only back in, you’re goingto pay for it every day. And we never prosecuted the other piece of it. The American dream is unaffordable. The American dream is inaccessible, and it’sunacceptable to us. The idea that people can walk around with multiple homes and a family can’t get a home, can’t afford a retirement, can’t afford their kid’seducation is unacceptable. Well, there’s a whole case to be made. Isn’t that a hard case to make when it’s worst in the places where Democrats govern? No, not at all, because this — you’re thinking about it because — I don’t want to criticize you on your show. I’m a fair target on my show, man. No, no, no, no, because you’re thinking of it linear. This is about where yourheart is. This is about where your sentiment is. It is, I mean, I want to go back to Bill Clinton, but as he said in the snows in New Hampshire, when his draftletter’s out: The hits on me are nothing compared to the hits your kids are going to take if we don’t turn this country around. I didn’t say to you one policy right there. It’s a sentiment about where your heart and soul is. Archived clip of Bill Clinton: Somebody’s got to stand up and fight for real change. Look, this is a contact sport. I knew all this would happen. Or I knewsomething like this would happen. This is not about me. I can handle this. What’s the worst that can happen to me? I go home to my family, my friends, mylife, my job. This is not a big deal. For me, it is a very big deal for the political process, and that’s where I want to leave it. I want to see thiselection fought out on what we’re going to do to change the future of the people of this country. And most of the people do, too. And they are being robbed ofthe chance to do it. That’s the point I want to make. I mean, I have my own criticism of what are tough things and how Democrats makethings more difficult than they need to be to get things done, as a former mayor trying to get a train station opened up and how many multiple environmentalstudies you have to do at the city level, the state level, the federal level. There is a need for reform, and we got to be honest about it. But the fact thatit’s more what I’m talking about, whether it’s owning a home, saving for your kids, education, saving for your retirement, being able to afford a health careexpense without going into Chapter 11. That is not only a sentiment but also where your heart and soul is. People are — yes, you are right, linear, Ezra: What are the policies to do that? But they really just want to know: Do you get it? Do you know where they are? Iused to, I mean, there was a whole thing we started, what I called Congress on Your Corner. And I used to meet people at grocery stores, not town halls but justwhere they lived their lives, where they’re shopping. And if they wanted to come over and talk about Medicare, Medicaid, veterans’benefits, immigration issues, schools, some of my best policies that I introduced came from those times when I met people at a grocery store, Congress on Your Corner. So when you say, “Oh, well, that’s the worst in cities,” I don’t agree with that. It’s just kind of broad brush. That said, there’s enough problems that we could be the party that reforms government, makes it more and more responsive to people. I want to pick up on that idea of reform and corruption. I was thinking this week and talking to people in politics who actually run in and win elections, and thiskept coming up: That in 1994 one of the absolute best issues for Republicans in retaking Congress for the first time in 40 years was reform. They ran on termlimits on balanced budget. They ran against Democrats as corrupt and out of touch. People really, I think, forget how much Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign was areformist campaign. Archived clip of Barack Obama: I’ll make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the people’s business. Justice Louis Brandeis once said, “Sunlight is the greatest disinfectant.” And as president,I’m going to make it impossible for congressmen or lobbyists to slip pork barrel projects or corporate welfare into laws when no one’s looking. Because when I’mpresident, meetings where laws are written will be more open to the public. No more secrecy. That’s a commitment I make to you as president. He ran against special interests, against cable news, against political consultants. He was somebody who ran as disgusted with the way Washington worked.In 2016, Donald Trump ran as a political reformer, a wrecking ball to drain the swamp. 2006, we ran against the House that Tom DeLay built. Archived clip of Nancy Pelosi: Because this all comes back to the American people. They have to have confidence that Congress is here to work in the people’s interest, not the special interest. They have to know — and I honestlybelieve — that you cannot advance the people’s agenda unless you drain the swamp that is Washington, D.C. And then in this election, one of the things that happened was Democrats became very much synonymous with the institutions. Joe Biden is both the president andhas been in Washington for many decades. Kamala Harris is the vice president of that administration. And one thing that just did not exist in the Democraticcampaign was any kind of reformist impulse. There was Donald Trump, who hates the way Washington works — A hundred percent. — and the Democrats, who were there to defend Washington from Donald Trump. Reform and corruption aren’t the same thing, and yes, they also are heads and tails of the same coin. This is also why in Europe, you’re getting people runningraces against Brussels. We don’t fully — I can say as a former mayor of big city — government is way toobig and cumbersome, and it is too hard to do basic things, and we end up defending the rules rather than the results. We need to be the party that is for theresults, and if the government is a problem or the rules and regulations have the right purpose but are becoming their own problem, we’re defending something thatis indefensible. Look, a classic example, if climate change, which I agree, is an existentialcrisis, you don’t leave it just to FERC. It’s either an existential crisis, or FERC is the greatest thing that ever existed. FERC being the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the group that does transmission, line regulations and permitting. Thank you for explaining what I said. Democrats seem a lot out of touch to me, Rahm. Too many acronyms. I have a rule here as ambassador. One acronym per paragraph. OK, that’s it. No more. Look, I agree climate change is an existential crisis, but you can’t tell me it’s an existential crisis and the way FERC operates to agree to get a transmissionline in, which has a seven-year backlog, is perfect, never to be touched. We’re going to defend FERC. I understand the role it plays. Are you telling me there’snothing we can do that guarantees an end result in two years so we can actually do what we said we were going to do? Get transmission lines that can handle solar,wind and other renewables? It’s crazy. And on the face of it, it’s crazy. It’s an existential crisis thatwill wait seven years for a result to build a transmission line from one city to another. My grandfather said — the great political philosopher Herman Smulevitz —what are you, meshuga? This is crazy. I did an L stop near McCormick Place, a train stop in Chicago. We had to do an environmental study. After we were done,the state did an environmental study, another 18 months. After both of us were done, we sent it up to Washington. They did another environmental study. Really?And you’re telling me there’s nothing we can do? It took three years to put a train station on an empty lot. It’s crazy. One reason this is a hard case for Democrats to make is there’s nothing they did, specifically here. This has been a frustration for me because I focus much toomuch, probably, on environmental permitting and siting. Look, the Biden administration, the administration you’re part of as ambassador, their signal accomplishment is the Inflation Reduction Act, which is primarily built arounddecarbonization investments and, alongside that, the infrastructure bill — And health care. I think that’s an important thing that was in there, but I’m going to say the climate investments were the big piece of that. And they did not ever put forward— even though they know, and they have said publicly, that a huge problem is getting this stuff built quickly — they did not ever put forward their ownsignificant permitting reform plan, bill, anything. They supported the Joe Manchin plan that eventually emerged, which was a mixedbag, to say the least, but because it would split their own coalition, because permitting reform is a difficult issue for Democrats because a lot of theenvironmental groups don’t like it, they never came out and said, “This is what we think we should do to truly speed this up.” The party should have done what — and I’m not here to try to relive Bill Clinton — the Al Gore. It worked. The Al Gore commission that reformed government. It didactually cut bureaucrats in Washington, rules and regulations, and it funded adding 100,000 community police officers throughout the country, which, actually,is starting in ’94. If you take 10 years after ’94 versus 10 years before ’94, you can look at the difference between crime rates. It worked on reforming government.It also worked on funding public safety and other initiatives that Democrats cared about. We should be against government rules. Now, side note. This is not the core of your question. People always say democracy is broken. It’s not. It’s very successful at the state and local level, wherepeople have trust in their government and feel it touches their lives and they have a connection to it. It’s broken in Brussels and in Washington, the farthergovernment gets away. We’re only — rules and regulations are what we care about, and processes. We never, ever talk about the results. We defend a status quo that is broken. We’re insane doing it politically, and it’s not actually accurate about what it’s trying to accomplish. And then there’s aside piece. I laughed when — I was snickering here, you can’t tell — when President Obama becomes a senator, I’m a congressman of Illinois, and Chicago,Marty Meehan, my colleague in the House, and Senator Obama, Russ Feingold, John McCain, we worked on a lobbying and ethics reform legislation, and it passed it,and — I’m unfairly, I can’t, I think it was Chris Shays was the Republican in the House who worked with us on it. It was bipartisan, etc. Yeah, fighting, and it was coming on the heels — we fought against all the corruption that — you used to talk about public corruption, but a lot of people also saw the war and the way it was prosecuted at that time as corruption. It wasn’t this distinct piece of government rules, regulations, money, lobbyists,access, etc. They also thought the way Washington worked, how we got ourselves deceptively into a war was corruption. And so we worked on that together, and it was what President Obama ran on because we had worked on it when he was a senator and I was a congressman. It was thelegislation we introduced and passed. And again, whether it’s the integrity of public service or whether it’s also knowing that the system and the rules andregulations are not producing the results we want, we, as part of the establishment, have adopted the voice of defending the establishment when it’sfailing. It makes no sense policywise, and it’s absolutely a dead failure politically. Why do you think Democrats have done that? And you’re asking me: “Democrats,” and it’s, like, a lot of us, but — Why do you think that has happened? I think it’s happened because we’re comfortable in being the establishment. We’recomfortable with what we have built and defended. Even Franklin Delano Roosevelt talked about constantly reforming, constantlychanging. If it doesn’t succeed, throw it out; try something else. I want to tell a little anecdote to illustrate a point. In the balanced budget negotiations in1997, when we get to kids’ health care, President Clinton had pediatric care, eye and dental care paid through Medicaid expansion, to take kids whose parentsworked, made more money than Medicaid, but get them health care. The Republicans had only pediatric care, no eye and dental, but it had to be a new program outsideMedicaid because they hated Medicaid. Final blah, blah, blah, blah, we — Bruce Reed, Gene Sperling, myself — wenegotiate, it would be the president’s health care plan, pediatric care, eye and dental, but it would not be in Medicaid. And a number of Democrats voted againstit because we weren’t screaming about Medicaid. I said, I’ve got to say this as a son of a pediatrician — and I know a lot ofpeople think I’m a son of something else — but people never talked about how they got paid. They cared about whether the kids had eye and dental care. That’s whatthe priorities are. And we were a defender of how it was going to be funded rather than what the result was. The result of kids’ health care plan was to get kidshealth care, not to fight about which government program paid it or whether it was a new one. I get the point. It’s very important. If you work at the Brookings Institution in Aspen, it is not important if you’re a working mother and you’re single and you’retrying to figure out how to get your children health care and make sure they have glasses so they can read the blackboard. That’s what matters. And we were — we lost people because it wasn’t Medicaid expansion. And again, it’s legitimate. It’s just not more important than the end result. Which was healthcare for children. I think this show is very good for my emotional health. I’m happy to hear that. We try to provide many levels of service here at “The Ezra Klein Show.” I don’t think you actually get the full benefit of what you’re doing. The critique I hear is that the reason the Democratic Party does not want tochange more or does not focus more on changing the way things work is that many of the people in it benefit from it, and they benefit from it in ways that arelegitimate and straightforward. They work for programs that they want those programs to be funded. They use powers like the ability to sue under theenvironmental litigation. They may, they often use it for good reasons, but then they don’t want it foreclosed on them, even if it’s having bad effects elsewhere. And there’s a view that there’s corruption in the Democratic Party, too. There’s views that Nancy Pelosi did not want to change the rules on insider trading ofindividual stocks among members of Congress. But there is a sense that Democrats are in this system, making money, having good jobs, being inside the revolvingdoor and that you can’t trust them to change a system they benefit from, all the way from the staffers moving from place to place up to people like Rahm Emanueland Nancy Pelosi, who have done pretty well in politics. Well, look, I think the real problem is you’re conflating both reforming ethicsand reforming the government, the way it works. So I would just say to you that the two, while they fit together, they’re separate issues. The fact is, the Democrats have always been the party — not always, we have ups and downs on this — fighting corruption. I can say that is in my tenure as mayor,three different ethics packages, and I can continue to do that. And we have to be a party that is never satisfied, never the defenders of the status quo, alwayswanting to change something, make other people’s lives better. And that’s been our voice, going back to whether it’s Kennedy, Roosevelt, Truman,whatever, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, pick your president. The fact is being satisfied with the way things are is not where people are. But I think the argument here is that people in the Democratic Party benefit from the way things are. And they raise money from the way things are. And that’s a tough thing about the system. You need money to run these elections. I was reading a bunch of old pieces — New Yorker profiles of you, pieces about the’06 campaign — about the just difficulty of raising money in that campaign, the decisions you all were making for this $100,000 or that $500,000. And the argumentthat has been made again and again — is it just in order to win in the system, you almost have to become a party that is a defender of the system and that that’ssomething, in the end, that in his own strange way, Trump, with his own money, Elon Musk, with his own money, were able to exploit because people thought theywere outside the system and, as such, not corrupted by it. True and not true. That’s why you prosecute a case that the Oval Office is goingto become eBay and sell out. That’s why you prosecute that case, because if you’re telling me that we’re the only people, individuals that — quote, unquote — makingmoney on the system, which I don’t accept that critique, then you make it about the other side, which actually, if you go look at the polling and the focusgroups, was more believable. One thing I wonder if Democrats are underestimating the danger of is the VivekRamaswamy-Elon Musk Department of Government Efficiency. And you’ve got Musk, who has an incredibly loud megaphone through X, which he owns and controls. And it’s sitting outside the government. It’s not exactly clear what power it will have. They’re putting people like Marjorie Taylor Greene in charge of importantdimensions of this, which suggests to me they may not approach this in the most strategic and careful way, but nevertheless, you have something that can haveincredible levels of media attention and publicity around it, where Republicans are, in a very high-profile way, going at what they call government inefficiency. What have you thought watching that thing stand up, and how do you think Democrats should respond to it? I would say welcome it. And I would say 100 percent ready to meet with you, so let’s go and have a full agenda that puts them on their back foot. And they haveto make a choice between what they say they’re for and what their actual interests are. The part of a political strategy is you put people in, as Yogi Berra used to say, where you get to the fork in the road, take it. And so that’s what would be myapproach. Not fight it. People want to reform something, change something. I’m 100 percent for it. Let’s go. Couldn’t be more excited. Ready to meet today. And then I would put it down on the table, and I’d have a full agenda, 10 items, that is proactive, not waiting, not on the receiving. Don’t say, “Show me stuff.” Here’s what we want to get done, and then go right at the soft underbelly of the other side. The flip side of that commission is that all of a sudden, you have Ramaswamy, who was on this show and has made the point that, in his view, Medicare and Medicaidare mistakes. You have Musk, who is tweeting out Ron Paul clips. It reminds me a little bit ofBush and Social Security privatization, where you have Trump, a candidate who did not run on massive spending cuts to government, who has now appointed people whoget attention on them in a way other people who are in his actual government will not, who seem very excited about cutting, ideally, trillions of dollars ingovernment spending. The new person Trump is appointing Treasury secretary has also talked about the need for very significant spending cuts. Trump for a longtime operated outside of the long-running Republican desire to slash deep into government operations, in ways that were often pretty unpopular. And in his firstterm, Republicans spent more money and didn’t pay for it and cut taxes and didn’t pay for it. And now, all of a sudden, in the second term, it seems there is a return, but under a more Trumpist banner, of the hack-and-slash side of the Republican Party.Is that an opportunity for Democrats? Yes, they have inherent contradiction. They have people who want to cut SocialSecurity, Medicare and Medicaid, and they have a president that doesn’t. That’s, like, “Go. Let’s go for it. Let’s go have this debate. Ready.” And if they want togo after poor kids and nutritional programs, let’s have it. They want to go after the subsidies we give single people who are small-business owners, getting accessto health care and have premium support, let’s have that. I’m ready. I will tell you this one anecdote: I’m named by President Obama as chief of staff.So one of the things I first do when we get to Washington is I ask Senator Mitch McConnell, then the minority leader, for a meeting, and he brings his leadership.And Senator McConnell says: I think we should work on Social Security. And remember: This is ’08. The economy is literally going head first into adepression. And the idea that the first thing we’re going to work on is Social Security. So I said, well, why don’t we do this? There’s a lot of ideas kickingaround. Why don’t you propose some legislation on Social Security, what your ideas are for reform. And I will tell you, we’ll be open to hearing about them. But you’re a big leader. You have a big platform. Make your changes. We’re going to work right now ongetting the economy away from a depression. And he kind of had this wry smile, knowing exactly what I was saying. So if others in the Republican Party and President Trump’s appointees want to propose cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, put it out there. Be my guest. I got some ideas of how to expand healthcare coverage for people. You have ideas about how you want to cut it. Fine, let’s have that debate. You’ve been floated by David Axelrod, among others, for Democratic National Committee chair. Is that a job you want? I think I want the Democrats to get back to being the majority party and fighting for the families and their children. Whether I’m going to finish up my job in the next month here in Tokyo — I have three things I got to get done. Feel very good about the tenure here in thealliance, and when I get back to America and back to my home in Chicago, I’ll make my decision of what I’m going to do, the best way I think I can do that. Whoever is D.N.C. chair next, what should the D.N.C. be? Political parties are something very different than they were three generations ago. Two generationsago. They go back and forth right now. Laura Trump is a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, so that’s become a much more personalist party. When you look at the Democratic Party — and you’ve been a Democratic Party man for many, many years now and serving in many different dimensions of it — what do youthink the party should do? What role should it play in people’s lives? What is a political party in the year 2024, and what should it be in the year 2030? Well, you got to deal with the here and now, and then you got to plan for the long term. So one is within a year, you’re going to have a very important election forgovernor of New Jersey and governor of Virginia, and you’re going to have State House elections. Now, you got to make sure you have the resources for that and theability to support the candidates who get the nomination and to make the most of what will be one year into President Trump’s tenure. And one of the things I think Democrats have to do, if I was at D.N.C. and working with the party chairs — but I’m not that — is we are going to have every position,every county, somebody’s going to be, to have a name on the ballot, because if it’s a referendum election, you want to have people in poll position, and you gotto have the infrastructure to do that. Both the old shoe leather plus digital, not one or the other. But then there’s theideas. We have spent eight years telling everybody what we’re against on Donald Trump. We’re very anti-Trump. We haven’t filled out the profile of what we’re pro-America. Now, I’m a product, like everybody else is, of my tenure. You could go back to President Clinton’s “Three Covenant” speeches. He filled outthat he was not just against 12 years of Reagan and Bush, but here’s what we got to do, as he would say, to build a bridge to the 21st century so everybody can get across that bridge. So you have to not just build an identity opposing Trump; youhave to also build an identity of who you’re fighting for, why you’re fighting, who you’re fighting against and what you’re fighting for the end result to be. And a party can help build that. Now, in past times, when Bill Clinton was head of the D.L.C., that was the intellectual energy — the Democratic Leadership Circle —for that kind of intellectual work. So a party has to do both of those: not only win elections, not only help [inaudible], not only fund them, not only have theinfrastructure but then have the intellectual healthy debate about where we’re going to go as a party and how we’re going to do that. You talked about finding candidates in 2006 that defied the stereotypes of the Democratic Party and helped pick the locks in Republican districts, candidates whohad a different profile on national security or law enforcement. Given what this moment is, given the types of places in which Democrats are struggling — morerural districts, working-class voters — who are those candidates now? If you were either overseeing or advising a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairworking on candidate recruitment, who are you looking for? You know, it’s interesting if you look at some of the front-runners in both theNew Jersey governor’s race and the Virginia governor’s race. I think Josh Gottheimer in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia — both havebeen independent enough that they’ve taken on their own party. It’s part of their character. It’s part of their profile. They’re not just a yes person. They havefought, whether it’s leadership or interest groups. There’s got to be a primary; they got to win it, but it’s interesting to me that those are some of the namesbattling around. I think independence is a streak that I’m going to look for, that if I was sittinghere and I could — like, give me somebody that ran against the grain, said publicly what people are thinking but then have the courage and they did, so theirindependence is a quality that gives them kind of the anti-establishment, the anti-elite tone that I would be — I’m sitting here at 10,000 feet, two years, youknow, we’re about three weeks away from the last election, already talking about — To me, independence, saying things that aren’t politically correct, willing totake on not just X interest group or whatever but even your own party’s interest group or leadership — to me, that’s the gold mine I want to go work in. Democrats are watching with a lot of alarm at nominations like Hegseth for defense, nominations like Tulsi Gabbard for national intelligence. They were, veryobviously, worried about the Matt Gaetz nomination. That has been since withdrawn or replaced by Pam Bondi. There are things Donald Trump is doing and will do that have more of the flavor of authoritarianism, more of the flavor of installing loyalists in key roles where the government could be weaponized. And on the one hand, I think that is the most dangerous set of things I see him at least seeming to be interested in. And on the other hand, those may not be thethings that most Americans care about or even really believe you on. Those are not pocketbook issues. Those are not necessarily corruption that will line hispockets. And so there’s going to be, at least sometimes, this choice Democrats need to makebetween the things that scare them most and the things that, if you’re watching a focus group or thinking about what will help in a forthcoming election, you reallywant to make the center of your message over and over and over and over again. How do you think about that trade-off when you are trying to oppose or blocksomeone who does seem to have authoritarian at least pretenses? President Trump and his team, it’s going to be a target-rich environment of thingsyou’re going to oppose. But not everything has to be opposed. And you’re going to have to be disciplined about: You pick and choose where you’re going to have thefight. If you fight everything, then part of his strategy is to so overwhelm the system,you’re going to drown in it. When it comes to a cabinet — this may be the old chief of staff in me — if you’re on the other side of this, you’re going to haveto pick where you’re going to — you can’t do the whole cabinet, and you can’t do all of them. You can’t do — just you want to do national security. And so you haveto, if you’re Democrats organizing this, you’re going to have to look at the whole field: What makes Republicans most uncomfortable? They’re not going to break fromthe president on all of them. What puts them in the weakest position not only vis- à-vis the White House, but what puts them in the weakest position vis-à-vis theAmerican people? And then that person and that fight become character-defining of the other sideand character-defining for your side. So I look at this, and I look at Tulsi Gabbard as a place, when you look at all the information — and they’ll run aprocess that’s going to make the Republicans in the Senate very, very uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. There’s a tactical win there, and it will expose certain things. And so you have to think of it both tactically and strategically, and then which fights do I wantto beat the more prominent — not just about the people but about other things? I happen to think that we want to be the party that positions that Donald Trump andthe Republicans are now the establishment. They’re pulled into a whole set of special interests, and you are not going to be in their line of sight, except for your pocketbook. Look, you’re going to have an attempt to politicize the Federal Reserve. You’re going to have a massive discussion — raising of tariffs — and you’re going to talkabout another couple trillion dollars to the national debt. I think at a certain point there’s a possibility that the credibility of theUnited States could get hit. Not only is inflation not going to go down; it’s going to continue to go up, and I think we can make an argument that you’re goingto be paying the cost for these individuals and the special interests that they represent. You talked about autocracy and threat to democracy. We have people on that. It’s what they’re going to do to your wallet and your children that I want to protect.And there’s going to be a set of events, when it comes to cost and affordability, that is going to be real, and you’re setting it up not just for that individualfight but from here all the way through the midterms up to 2028. I could be wrong and maybe somebody else has a different view that it is aboutdemocracy. They can make that argument. I think we just have an election that proved that. I think this is about people’s pocketbooks, and I think it’s aboutwho their opponents are fighting for and who we’re fighting for, not just the end result but who we’re going to fight for.
