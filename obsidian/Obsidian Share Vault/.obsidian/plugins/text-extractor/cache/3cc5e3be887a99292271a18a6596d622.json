Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high- frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertake empirical analyses to understand this bias and discover that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across dif- ferent frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate fore- casting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our pro- posed approach, which can outperform other baselines in differ- ent real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs.

Forecasting time series could provide insights for decision-making support, such as potential traffic congestion [10] or changes in stock market trends [34]. Accurate forecasting typically involves discerning vari- ous informative temporal variations in historical observations, e.g., trends, seasonality, and fluctuations, which are consistent in fu- ture time series [42]. Benefiting from the advancements in deep learning, the community has seen great progress, particularly with Transformer-based methods [39, 41, 49]. Successful methods of- ten tokenize time series with multiresolution, such as time points [43] or sub-series [48], and model their dependencies leveraging the self-attention mechanism. Several state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines have been proposed, namely PatchTST [29], Crossformer [48], and iTransformer [24], and demonstrate impressive performance. Despite their success, the effectiveness with which we can cap- ture informative temporal variations remains a concern. From a data perspective, a series of time observations is typically considered a complex set of signals or waves that varies over time [13, 17]. Vari- ous temporal variations, manifested as different frequency waves, such as low-frequency long-term periodicity or high-frequency fluctuation, often co-occur and are intermixed in the real world [19, 21, 42]. While tokenizing a time series may provide fine-grained information for the model, the temporal variations in resulting tokens or sub-series are also entangled. This issue may complicate the feature extraction and forecasting performance. Existing works have proposed frequency decomposition to represent the time se- ries and deployed Transformers on new representation to explicitly learn eventful frequency features [42, 43]. Learning often incorpo- rates feature selection strategies in the frequency domain, such as top-K or random-K [41, 50], to help Transformers better identify more relevant frequencies. However, such heuristic selection may introduce sub-optimal frequency correlations into the model (seen in Figure 1(a)), inadvertently misleading the learning process. From a model perspective, researchers have recently noticed a learning bias issue that is common in the Transformer. That is, the self- attention mechanism often prioritizes low-frequency features at thearXiv:2406.09009v4 [cs.LG] 3 Jul 2024 KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Xihao Piao*, Zheng Chen*, Taichi Murayama, Yasuko Matsubara, and Yasushi Sakurai (b) PatchTST (c) Ours(a) FEDformer FF A F Input Ground Truth Forecasting Figure 1: In contrast to a frequency modeling-based work FEDformer [50] and a SOTA work PatchTST [29], our model can accurately capture more significant mid-to-high frequency components. expense of high-frequency features [14, 30, 35, 36]. This subtle issue may also appear in time series forecasting, potentially biasing model outcomes and leading to information losses. Figure 1(b) shows an electricity case where the forecasting result successfully captures low-frequency features, neglecting some consistent mid-to-high frequencies. In practice, such high frequencies represent short- term variations, e.g., periodicities over short durations, which serve as good indicators for forecasting [10, 16, 34]. However, the low- frequencies typically carry a substantial portion of the energy in the spectrum and are dominant in time series. The amplitude of these low-frequency components far exceeds that of higher frequencies [51], which provides the Transformer with more observations. This may raise the possibility of frequency bias in time series forecasting, as the model might disproportionately learn from these dominant low-frequency components. This work explores one direction of capturing informative, com- plex variations by frequency domain modeling for accurate time se- ries forecasting. We introduce Fredformer, a Frequency-debiased Transformer model. Fredformer follows the line of frequency decomposition but further investigates how to facilitate the uses of Transformers in learning frequency features. To improve the effectiveness of our approach, we provide a comprehensive analy- sis of frequency bias in time series forecasting and a strategy for debiasing it. Our main contributions lie in three folds. - Problem definition. We undertake empirical studies to investi- gate how this bias is introduced into time series forecasting Trans- formers. We observe that the main cause is the proportional dif- ference between key frequency components. Notably, these key components should be consistent in the historical and ground truth of the forecasting. We also investigate the objective and key designs that affect debiasing. - Algorithmic design. Our Fredformer has three pivotal compo- nents: patching for the frequency band, sub-frequency-independent normalization to mitigate proportional differences, and channel- wise attention within each sub-frequency band for fairness learning of all frequencies and attention debiasing. - Applicability. Fredformer undertakes Nyström approximation to reduce the computational complexity of the attention maps, thus achieving a lightweight model with competitive performance. This opens new opportunities for efficient time series forecasting. Remark. This is the first paper to study the frequency bias issue in time series forecasting. Extensive experimental results on eight datasets show the effectiveness of Fredformer, which achieves superior performance with 60 top-1 and 20 top-2 cases out of 80. 2 PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS We present two cases to show ( i ) how frequency attributes of time series data introduce bias into forecasting with the Transformer model and ( ii) an empirical analysis of the potential debiasing strategy. This section introduces the notation and a metric for the case studies in Sec. 2.1. The case analyses are detailed in Sec. 2.2. 2.1 Preliminary Time Series Forecasting. Let X = {𝒙 (𝑐 ) 1 , . . . , 𝒙 (𝑐 ) 𝐿 } 𝐶 𝑐=1 denote a multivariate time series consisting of 𝐶 channels, where each channel records an independent 𝐿 length look-back window. For simplicity, we omit channel index 𝑐 in subsequent discussions. The forecasting task is to predict 𝐻 time steps in the future data ˆX: ˆX𝐿+1:𝐿+𝐻 = 𝑓 (X1:𝐿) where 𝑓 (·) denotes the forecasting function, which is a Transformer- based model in this work. Our objective is to mitigate the learning bias in the Transformer and enhance the forecasting outcome X′, that is, to minimize the error between X′ and ˆX. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). We use DFT to analyze the frequency content of X, ˆX, and X′. For example, given the input sequence {𝒙1, ..., 𝒙𝐿 }, the DFT can be formulated as 𝒂𝑘 = 1 𝐿 𝐿∑︁ 𝑙=1 𝒙𝑙 · 𝑓𝑘, 𝑘 = 1, . . . , 𝐿 where 𝑓𝑘 = 𝑒 −𝑖2𝜋𝑘/𝐿 denotes the 𝑘-th frequency component. The DFT coefficients A = {𝒂1, 𝒂2, . . . , 𝒂𝐿 } represent the amplitude in- formation of these frequencies. As illustrated in Figure 2 (b, left), four components are observed to have higher amplitudes in the historical observations (X) and the forecasting data ( ˆX).

Here, the inverse DFT (i.e., IDFT) is 𝒙𝑙 = Í𝐿 𝑘=1 𝒂𝑘 · 𝑓 −1 𝑘 , which reconstructs the time series data from the DFT coefficients. Frequency Bias Metric. Inspired by the work of [5, 46], this study employs a Fourier analytic metric of relative error Δ𝑘 to determine the frequency bias. Given the model outputs A′ and the ground truth ˆA, the mean-square error (MSE) for the 𝑘-th component is calculated as follows: MSE𝑘 = |𝒂′𝑘 − ˆ𝒂𝑘 |, where | · | denotes the L2 norm of a complex number. Then, the relative error is applied to mitigate scale differences. In other words, the error may become larger as the proportion of amplitude increases. Δ𝑘 = |𝒂′𝑘 − ˆ𝒂𝑘 |/| ˆ𝒂𝑘 | This metric is used in case study analyses and the experiments detailed in Section 5.2. 2.2 Case Studies We first generate single-channel time series data with a total length of 10000 timestamps and then employ a Transformer model [29] to forecast the data. The details are in Appendix A. For the first case study (Case 1), we generate two datasets with three key fre- quency components ({𝑘1, 𝑘2, 𝑘3}). Each dataset contains a different proportion of these three components, as illustrated in the DFT visualization in Figure 2. On the left side of the figure, their ampli- tudes are arranged as 𝒂𝑘1 < 𝒂𝑘2 < 𝒂𝑘3, whereas on the right side, the arrangement is 𝒂𝑘1 > 𝒂𝑘2 > 𝒂𝑘3. We maintain these propor- tions so that they are consistent between the observed A and the ground truth ˆA (i.e., A≈ ˆA). Then, we assess the bias for different 𝑘 in the Transformer outputs A′. Meanwhile, we track how Δ𝑘 changes during the model training to show the learning bias, using heatmap values to represent the numerical values of Δ𝑘 . Here, we generate a dataset with four key frequency components for the second case study (Case 2). This study analyzes different modeling strategies to investigate their flexibility for debiasing. 2.2.1 Investigating the Frequency Bias of Transformer (Case 1). As shown in Figure 2(a) (left), after 50 epochs of training, the model successfully captures the amplitude of low-frequency com- ponent 𝑘1 but fails to capture 𝑘2 and 𝑘3. Meanwhile, the heatmap values show that the model predominantly focuses on learning the 𝑘1 component. In other words, the relative error decreases to around 0.01 (red codes) during the training. But, it lacks opti- mization for 𝑘3, resulting in a high relative error of almost 0.95. These observations indicate that signals in the time domain can be represented by a series of frequency waves, typically dominated by low-frequency components [19, 27, 31]. When the Transformer is deployed on this mixed-frequency collection, the dominant propor- tion of frequencies experiences a learning bias. A similar result is also evident in the control experiment in the right Subfigure. Here, we introduce synthetic data with higher amplitudes in the mid and high-frequency ranges (resulting in 𝒂𝑘1 < 𝒂𝑘2 < 𝒂𝑘3). In response, the model shifts its focus towards the key component 𝑘3, leading to Δ𝑘1 > Δ𝑘2 > Δ𝑘3. This learning bias aligns with recent theoretical analyses of the Transformer model [30, 35, 36]. In addition, Sec. 3.1 provides a formal definition of this frequency bias. 2.2.2 Debiasing the Frequency Learning for Transformer (Case 2). Based on the above discussion, we initially use the same experimental settings for a new dataset, as shown in Figure 2(b) (Left). We then perform two feasibility analyses for debiasing by (1) mitigating the influence of high proportionality and (2) providing the transformer with fine-grained frequency information. (1) Frequency normalization: We first decompose the frequency domain and normalize the amplitudes of the frequencies to elimi- nate their proportional differences. Specifically, we apply the DFT, normalize the amplitudes, and then use the IDFT to convert the fre- quency representation back into the time domain before inputting it into the Transformer, formulated as X′ = (IDFT(A𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚)). As depicted in Figure 2(b) (middle and right), the four input components are adjusted so that they have the same amplitude value, shown by a blue dashed line. The middle subfigure shows that frequency normalization enhances the forecasting performance for the latter three frequencies, but relative errors remain high. (2) Frequency domain modeling: We further directly deploy the Transformer on the frequency domain to model the DFT matrix. Subsequently, we apply the IDFT to return the forecasting outcome to the time domain. Here, the purpose is to provide the transformer with more refined and disentangled frequency features. Formally, X′ = IDFT((A𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚)). As shown in Figure 2(b) (right), there is a marked improvement in forecasting accuracy for the latter three KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Xihao Piao*, Zheng Chen*, Taichi Murayama, Yasuko Matsubara, and Yasushi Sakurai frequency components. Notably, the bias in the second frequency component (60-75 Hz) is effectively eliminated. These findings sug- gest the potential for direct frequency domain modeling with proportion mitigation in achieving the debiasing. 3 FREQUENCY BIAS FORMULATION This section defines the frequency bias in Sec.3.1, then describes the research problem in Sec.3.2. 3.1 Frequency Bias Definitions Given the aforementioned empirical analyses, which demonstrate that a frequency bias exists in key frequency components, we first define these key components in terms of two properties: 1) a key component should have a relatively high amplitude within the spectrum, and 2) it should be consistent in historical observations and future time series, as well as robust to time shifts [4, 31]. Definition 1. Key Frequency Components. Given a frequency spectrum A with length 𝐿, A can be segmented into 𝑁 sub-frequency bands {𝒘1, 𝒘2, . . . , 𝒘𝑁 } by a sliding window, where 𝒘𝑛 ∈ R1×𝑠 . The maximum amplitude in the 𝑛-th window is determined as follows: max(𝒘𝑛) = max |𝒂𝑘 | : 𝒂𝑘 ∈ 𝒘𝑛 for 𝑛 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝑁 (1) where 𝒘𝑛 denotes 𝑠 amplitudes in the 𝑛-th window. If 𝒂𝑘 is a key component in the 𝑖-th window, then: 𝒂𝑘 = max(𝒘𝑛) and ˆ𝒂𝑘 = max( ˆ𝒘𝑛) ˜A is a collection of all key components. Notably, ˜A should be present in historical A and ground truth ˆA for accurate forecasting. Definition 2. Frequency Bias in Transformer. Given that a time series X contains 𝑁 key frequency components amplitudes ˜A = { ˜𝒂1, . . . , ˜𝒂𝑁 }, for the 𝑘-th component ˜𝒂𝑘 ∈ ˜A, we have 𝑃 ( ˜𝒂𝑘 ) = | ˜𝒂𝑘 | Í𝑁 𝑛=1 | ˜𝒂𝑛 | , which refers to the proportion of ˜𝒂𝑘 in the total sum of amplitudes of ˜A. Frequency bias can be defined as relative error Δ𝑘 . Here, a larger proportion 𝑃 ( ˜𝒂𝑘 ) leads to a smaller Δ𝑘 and exhibits a higher ranking: −|Δ𝑘 | ∝ 𝑃 ( ˜𝒂𝑘 ) (2) Eventually, the Transformer pays more attention to high-ranked components during the training, as seen in Figure 2 (a) heatmaps. 3.2 Problem Statement Based on the discussions in Sec. 2, we argue that if the Transformer assigns attention to all key frequency components ˜A equally during learning, then the frequency bias could be mitigated. Problem 1. Debiasing Frequency Learning for Transformer. Given a Transformer output 𝑓𝑇 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 (𝑋 ), where 𝑋 contains several key frequency component ˜𝒂𝑘 , our goal is to debias 𝑓𝑇 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 and improve performance by making the relative error Δ ˜𝒂𝑘 independent of 𝑃 ( ˜𝒂𝑘 ): −|Δ𝑘 | ̸∝ 𝑃 ( ˜𝒂𝑘 ) (3) thereby ensuring a balanced response by the Transformer to different key frequency components. 4 FREDFORMER Here, we discuss how to tackle the problem formulated in Sec.3.2 and propose Fredformer, a Frequency debiased Transformer model for accurate time series forecasting. Architecture Overview. Fredformer consists of four principal components: ( i ) a DFT-to-IDFT backbone, ( ii ) frequency domain refinement, ( iii ) local frequency independent learning, and ( iv ) global semantic frequency summarization. Figure 3 shows an ar- chitectural overview. The DFT-to-IDFT backbone breaks down the input time series X into its frequency components using DFT and learns a debiased representation of key frequency components by modules ( ii ) ( iii )and ( iv ). Based on the discussion in Sec. 2.2.2 (2), where we noted the significant potential of frequency modeling for debiasing, we first refine the overall frequency spectrum into sub-frequencies, which we achieve through a patching operation on DFT coefficients. Patches from different channels within the same sub-frequency band are embedded as tokens. That is, each sub-frequency band is encoded independently, which avoids the influence of other frequency components, as discussed in Section 2.2.2 (1). We deploy the Transformer to extract local frequency features for each sub-band across all channels. This mitigates the higher proportion crux defined in Def. 2. Finally, we summarize all the frequency information, which serves as IDFT for forecasting. A detailed workflow of Fredformer is in Appendix C. Below, we provide a description of each module. 4.1 Backbone Given X, we first use DFT to decompose X into frequency coeffi- cients A1 for all channels. We then extract the debiased frequency features by using a Transformer encoder to A ∈ R𝐶 ×𝐿. The fre- quency outputs are subsequently reconstructed to the time domain signal X′ by IDFT. X′ = IDFT(𝑓𝑇 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 (A)), A = DFT(X)) 4.2 Frequency Refinement and Normalization From the observations described in Sec. 2.2.2, we conclude that if there are significant proportional differences between different ˜A𝑘 values in the input data, it will lead to the model overly focusing on components with larger amplitudes. To address this issue, we propose frequency refinement and normalization. Specifically, a non-overlapping patching operation is applied to A along the 𝐶- axis (i.e., channel), resulting in a sequence of local sub-frequencies as follows: W = {W1, W2, . . . , W𝑁 } = Patching(A), W𝑛 ∈ R 𝐶 ×𝑆 where 𝑁 is the total number of the patches, while 𝑆 represents the length of each patch. Mitigating information redundancy over fine-grained frequency bands, such as neighboring 1 Hz and 2 Hz, allows the model to learn the local features in each sub-frequency. Parameter 𝑆 is adaptable to the requirements of real-world scenarios, for example, an hourly sampling of daily recordings or the alpha waveform typically occurring at 8-12 Hz [8]. 1A consists of two coefficient matrices: a real part R ∈ R𝐶 ×𝐿 and an imaginary matrix I ∈ R𝐶 ×𝐿. Since all operations are conducted synchronously for these two matrices, we will refer to them as A in our subsequent discussions. Fredformer: Frequency Debiased Transformer for Time Series Forecasting KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain DFT IDFT Frequency Domain Modeling Transformer Encoder Frequency Summarization Frequency Channel-Wise Attention Norm Linear Linear Figure 3: Overview of our framework. Fredformer employs DFT to transform input sequences into the frequency do- main, normalizes locally, and segments into patches before employing channel-wise attention, yielding final predictions through a frequency-wise summarizing layer and IDFT. Since patching operation allows the model to manage each M𝑛 independently, we further normalize each W𝑛 along the 𝑁 -axis: W ∗ 𝑛 = 𝜎 (W𝑛) 𝑛 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝑁 where 𝜎 (·) denotes the normalization, and it further projects the numerical value of each ˜A𝑘 into a range of 0-1. This operation eliminates proportionate differences in the maximum values within sub-frequency bands, thereby maintaining an equal Δ across all key components ˜A. Lemma 1. Frequency-wise Local Normalization: Given fre- quency patches ∀ W𝑛, W𝑚 ∈ W for max(W𝑛) > max(W𝑚) and 𝜎 (·), the normalization strategy is defined by: W∗ = {𝜎 (W1), . . . , 𝜎 (W𝑁 )} This ensures that within each localized frequency patch W𝑛, the am- plitude differences between key frequency components are minimized, promoting equal attention to all key frequencies by the model: max(W ∗ 𝑛) = max(W∗ 𝑚) Some studies also introduce patching operations in the time do- main and perform normalization within these time domain patches [29]. However, according to Parseval’s theorem [32], normalization within time domain patches is equivalent to normalizing across all frequencies. This could not address the issue of amplitude bias among key frequency components. A more detailed description can be found in Appendix G. 4.3 Frequency Local Independent Modeling Given the normalized W∗, we deploy frequency local independent Transformer encoders to learn the importance of each W∗ 𝑛 inde- pendently. For W(1:𝐶 ) 𝑛 = {𝒘 (1) 𝑛 , 𝒘 (2) 𝑛 , . . . , 𝒘 (𝐶 ) 𝑛 }𝑁 𝑛=1, a Transformer encoder 𝑓𝑇 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 (·) accepts each 𝒘∗ (𝑐 ) 𝑛 as an input token: {W′ (1:𝐶 ) 𝑛 } = 𝑓𝑇 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 (W ∗ (1:𝐶 ) 𝑛 ) where W′ (1:𝐶 ) 𝑛 is encoded by a channel-wise self-attention encoder: Attention(Q𝑛, K𝑛, V𝑛) = Softmax ( W∗ (1:𝐶 ) 𝑛 W 𝑞 𝑛 (W∗ (1:𝐶 ) 𝑛 W𝑘 𝑛)𝑇 √ 𝑑 ) W ∗ (1:𝐶 ) 𝑛 W𝑣 𝑛 where W 𝑞 𝑛, W𝑘 𝑛, W𝑣 𝑛 ∈ R𝑆 ×𝑀 are the weight matrices for generat- ing the query matrix Q𝑛, key matrix K𝑛, and value matrix V𝑛. √ 𝑑 denotes a scaling operation. The attention module also includes normalization and a feed-forward layer with residual connections [12], and Attention(Q𝑛, K𝑛, V𝑛) ∈ R𝐶 ×𝑀 weights the correlations among 𝐶 channels for the 𝑛-th sub-frequency band M𝑛. This de- sign ensures that the features of each sub-frequency are calculated independently, preventing learning bias. Lemma 2. Given W∗ (1:𝐶 ) 𝑛 = {𝒘∗(1) 𝑛 , 𝒘∗(2) 𝑛 , . . . , 𝒘∗(𝐶 ) 𝑛 }𝑁 𝑛=1, if W′𝑛 = 𝑓𝑇 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 (W∗ (1:𝐶 ) 𝑛 ), then by modeling the relationships of iden- tical frequencies 𝒘𝑐 𝑛 across different channels, for the 𝑘-th key com- ponent ˜𝒂𝑘 presents in 𝒘 (𝑐 ) 𝑛 , we have −|Δ(𝑐 ) 𝑘 | ∝ {|Δ(𝑐 ) 𝑘 |}𝐶 𝑐=1. The Transformer encoders will focus on channel-wise correlations instead of the {|Δ(𝑐 ) 𝑘 |}𝐾 𝑘=1, i.e., debiasing −|Δ(𝑐 ) 𝑘 | ̸∝ 𝑃 ( ˜𝒂𝑘 ). Lemma 2, which indicates a lower 𝑃 ( ˜𝒂𝑘 ) does not necessarily lead to an increase in |Δ ˜𝒂𝑘 |, thus avoiding disproportionate attention to frequency components. Channel-wise attention is proposed in the work of [24, 48]. We include these studies as the baselines and the results in Sec. 5.2. This work has different modeling purposes: we deploy self-attention on the aligned local features, i.e., in the same frequency bands across channels, for frequency debiasing. 4.4 Frequency-wise Summarization Given the learned features of the sub-frequencies W′ = {𝒘′ 1, 𝒘′ 2, . . . , 𝒘′ 𝑁 } of the historical time series X, the frequency-wise summarizing operation contains linear projections and IDFT: X′ = IDFT(A′) A′ = Linear(W′) where X′ ∈ R𝐶 ×𝐻 is the final output of the framework. 5 EXPERIMENTS 5.1 PROTOCOLS - Datasets.

All baselines use the same prediction length with 𝐻 ∈ {96, 192, 336, 720} for all datasets. The look-back window 𝐿 = 96 was used in our setting for fair comparisons, refer- ring to [24, 50]. We used MSE and MAE as the forecasting metrics. We further analyzed the forecasting results between the model outputs and the ground truth in the time and frequency domains. Using heatmaps, we tracked the way in which Δ𝑘 changes during training to show the debiased results of Fredformer compared with various SOTA baselines. 5.2 Results Forecasting Results. Table 1 shows the average forecasting per- formance across four prediction lengths. The best results are high- lighted in red, and the second-best in blue. With a default look-back window of 𝐿 = 96, our approach realizes leading performance levels on most datasets, securing 14 top-1 and 2 top-2 positions across two metrics over eight datasets. More detailed results for 4 of the eight datasets are shown in Table 2, where our method achieves 34 top-1 and 6 top-2 rankings out of 40 possible outcomes across the four prediction lengths. More comprehensive results regarding the different prediction length settings on all datasets and the impact of extending the look-back window are detailed in Appendix D and I. Frequency Bias Evaluation. Figure 4 is a case study visualization in the frequency domain, i.e., the DFT plot. The input, forecast out- put, and ground truth data series are shown in blue, red, and green, respectively. Similar to Section 2.2, the heat map shows the relative error for four selected mid-to-high frequency components over increasing epochs. After training, Fredformer accurately identifies 𝑘1, 𝑘2, and 𝑘3, with uniformly decreasing relative errors. Despite a larger learning error for 𝑘4, Δ𝑘4 consistently diminishes. This performance contrasts with all the baselines, demonstrating a lack of effectiveness in capturing these frequency components, with unequal reductions in relative errors. In contrast, PatchTST demon- strates a sudden improvement in component accuracy (𝑘2,𝑘3) dur- ing the final stages of training. FEDformer fails to capture these frequency components, possibly because its strategy of selecting and learning weights for only a random set of 𝑘 components over- looks all unselected components. Notably, iTransformer overlooks mid-to-high frequency features, partially learning components 𝑘1 Method FEDformer PatchTST Crossformer iTransformer Ours Ours*(Nyström) Complexity 𝑂 (𝐿𝐶) 𝑂 ( 𝐿2 𝑃 2 𝐶) 𝑂 ( 𝐿2 𝑃 2 𝐶) 𝑂 (𝐶2) 𝑂 ( 𝐿 𝑃 𝐶2) 𝑂 ( 𝐿 𝑃 𝐶) Table 6: The theoretical computational complexity of Transformer-based methods. and 𝑘3 while ignoring 𝑘2 and 𝑘4, indicating a clear frequency bias. This may stem from its use of channel-wise attention alongside global normalization in the time domain, as discussed in Lemma 1 and further supported by our ablation study 5.3. This highlights the effectiveness of frequency refinement and normalization. 5.3 Ablation Study Channel-wise Attention and Frequency Refinement. We eval- uate the effectiveness of channel-wise attention and frequency refinement. To this end, we remove each component by ablation and compare it with the original Fredformer. Table 5 shows that our method consistently outperforms others in all experiments, highlighting the importance of integrating channel-wise attention with frequency local normalization in our design. Interestingly, em- ploying frequency local normalization alone yields better accuracy than channel-wise attention alone. This suggests that minimizing proportional differences in amplitudes across various key frequency components is crucial for enhancing accuracy. Effect of Patch Length. This ablation evaluates the impact of patch length using the ETTh1 dataset. We conduct four experi- ments with 𝑆 = [8, 16, 32, 48] patch lengths and corresponding patch numbers 𝑁 = [6, 3, 2, 1]. In this context, 𝑁 = 1 means fre- quency normalization and channel-wise attention are applied to the entire spectrum without a patching operation. Table 4 shows the forecasting accuracy for each setting. As the patch length increases, the granularity of the frequency features extracted by the model becomes coarser, decreasing forecasting accuracy. 5.4 Discussion of Applicability Beyond algorithmic considerations, we further discuss the practi- cal deployment of Fredformer in real-world scenarios, with the primary challenge being memory consumption during model train- ing. The 𝑂 (𝑛2) complexity of self-attention limits the use of longer historical time series for forecasting, generating the need for in- novations to reduce computational demands [21, 29, 49]. Through patching operations, we decrease the complexity from 𝑂 (𝐿𝐶2) to 𝑂 ( 𝐿 𝑃 𝐶2). However, our channel-wise attention increases the com- putational costs with the number of channels, potentially limiting practical applicability with many channels. To address this, we pro- pose a lightweight Fredformer, inspired by NyströmFormer [45], which applies a matrix approximation to the attention map. This de- sign allows us to further reduce our complexity to 𝑂 ( 𝐿 𝑃 𝐶) without the need to modify the feature extraction (attention computation) or the data stream structure within the Transformer, unlike with previous methods [23, 43, 49, 50].

The plain Fredformer achieves high accuracy with low computational costs with fewer channels, such as ETTh1 with 7 channels. However, as shown in the ECL dataset (321 channels), the computational costs increase while maintaining high accuracy as the channel number increases. Here, Nyström-Fredformer fur- ther reduces computational requirements without compromising accuracy (the right sub-figure), showing that our model can realize computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy. Further details and derivations are provided in Appendix H. 6 RELATED WORKS Transformer for Time Series Forecasting. Forecasting is impor- tant in time series analysis [1, 15]. Transformer has significantly progressed in time series forecasting[18, 29, 48]. Earlier attempts focused on improving the computational efficiency of Transform- ers for time series forecasting tasks[3, 23, 49]. Several studies have used Transformers to model inherent temporal dependencies in the time domain of time series[21, 23, 24, 29, 49]. Various studies have integrated frequency decomposition and spectrum analysis with the Transformer in modeling temporal variations [41, 43] to improve the capacity for temporal-spatial representation. In [50], attention layers are designed that directly function in the frequency domain to enhance spatial or frequency representation. Modeling Short-Term Variation in Time Series. Short-term variations are intrinsic characteristics of time series data and play a crucial role in effective forecasting [10, 25]. Numerous deep learning-based methods have been proposed to capture these tran- sient patterns [2, 7, 9, 28, 33, 37, 38, 40, 43]. Here, we summarize some studies closely aligned with our proposed method. Pyraformer [23] applies a pyramidal attention module with inter-scale and intra- scale connections to capture various temporal dependencies. FED- former [50] incorporates a Fourier spectrum within the attention computation to identify pivotal frequency components. Beyond Transformers, TimesNet [42] employs Inception blocks to capture intra-period and inter-period variations. Channel-wise Correlation. Understanding the cross-channel cor- relation is also critical for time series forecasting. Several studies aimed to capture intra-channel temporal variations and model the inter-channel correlations using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [6, 44]. Recently, Crossformer [48] and iTransformer [24] both adopted channel-wise Transformer-based frameworks, and exten- sive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of channel-wise attention for time series forecasting. 7 CONCLUSION In this paper, we first empirically analyzed frequency bias, delving into its causes and exploring debiasing strategies. We then provided a formulation of this bias based on our analytical insights. We pro- posed the Fredformer framework with three critical designs to tackle this bias and thus ensure unbiased learning across frequency bands. Our extensive experiments across eight datasets confirmed the excellent performance of our proposed method. Visual anal- ysis confirmed that our approach effectively mitigates frequency bias. The model analysis further illustrated how our designs aid frequency debiasing and offered preliminary guidelines for future model design. Additionally, a lightweight variant of our model ad- dresses computational efficiency, facilitating practical application.

This process not only constructs a dataset with distinct frequency characteristics but also preserves the inherent noise and instability of the real data, enhancing the robustness and credibility of subsequent analyses. Specifically, the steps are as follows: (1) Apply the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the original time series data to obtain its frequency components, exclud- ing columns irrelevant for Fourier analysis (e.g., dates). (2) Select four prominent low-frequency components from the entire frequency spectrum and move them to the mid-frequency part. This modification aims to reduce the impact of fre- quency bias typically seen between low and high frequencies by placing important components in a non-low and non-high frequency position. (3) Split the frequency components into three equal parts. (4) Rearrange these parts according to a predefined order for frequency emphasis, ensuring that the first part is moved to the end while keeping the original second and third parts in their order. (5) Apply the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) to the rearranged frequency data to convert it back into the time domain, thereby generating the modified \"mid\" frequency data. (6) Reinsert any excluded columns (e.g., dates) to maintain the original structure of the data. Through the operations described above, we have constructed a dataset with clearly high amplitude frequency components in the middle of the frequency domain. By moving significant low- frequency components to the mid-frequency section, we aim to mitigate the effects of frequency differences that arise from the dominance of low and high frequencies. The advantage of creating artificial data through these simple modifications to real data lies in its ability to preserve the inherent noise and instability present in the real data, thereby enhancing the robustness and credibility for subsequent analysis. B MORE DETAILS OF THE DATASETS Weather contains 21 channels (e.g., temperature and humidity) and is recorded every 10 minutes in 2020. ETT [49] (Electricity Transformer Temperature) consists of two hourly-level datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2) and two 15-minute-level datasets (ETTm1, ETTm2). Electricity [20], from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and preprocessed by, is composed of the hourly electricity consumption of 321 clients in kWh from 2012 to 2014. Solar-Energy [19] records the solar power production of 137 PV plants in 2006, sampled every 10 minutes. Traffic contains hourly road occupancy rates measured by 862 sensors on San Francisco Bay area freeways from January 2015 to December 2016. More details of these datasets can be found in Table.7.

It includes several parts: (i) DFT-to-IDFT Backbone, where the input data is trans- formed using DFT and segmented into frequency bands; (ii & iii) Frequency Local Independent Learning, where normalization and a Transformer are applied to learn dependencies and features across channels; and (iv) Frequency-wise Summarizing, where the pro- cessed frequency information is summarized and transformed back to the time domain using IDFT to obtain the forecasting result. D LOOK-BACK WINDOW ANALYSIS We conducted further tests on our method using the ETTh1 and Weather datasets to investigate the impact of different look-back window lengths on forecasting accuracy. Four distinct lengths were chosen: {96, 192, 336, 720}, with 96 corresponding to the results presented in the main text and the other three lengths selected to compare the changes in forecasting accuracy with longer input sequences. Figure. 6 illustrates the variation in model forecasting accuracy across these input lengths. Overall, as the length of the input sequence increases, so does the model forecasting accuracy, demonstrating that our model is capable of extracting more features from longer input sequences. Specifically, comparing the longest window of 720 to the shortest of 96, the model forecasting accuracy improved by approximately 10% (0.343 → 0.315 for Weather and 0.467 → 0.449 for ETTh1).

We tested one hundred hyperparameter combinations, with results shown in Figure E. The variation in the model accuracy, ranging from 0.433 to 0.400 with an average value of 0.415, shows our preference for stability in hyperparameter selection over chasing the highest possible accuracy. We decided to utilize the averaged accuracy as our benchmark result in Table I. Visual representations of each hyperparameter impact on model robustness are detailed as follows: 96 192 336 720MSE Look-back window Length ETTh1 Weather Figure 6: The forecasting performance on two datasets, ETTh1 and Weather, across four different look-back win- dow lengths.

F VISUALIZATIONS OF THE FORECASTING RESULTS Due to space constraints and the length of the paper, we have omitted a significant number of visualization results in the main text. In the appendix, we provide additional visualization results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Here, we divide the visualization results into two categories: (1) time-domain visual- izations and (2) frequency-domain visualizations. These categories highlight two critical aspects of our model effectiveness: (1) the accuracy of predictions in the time domain and (2) the capability to capture important components in the frequency domain. F.1 Time domain We have included additional samples from two different channels of the ETTh1 dataset. Figure 13 presents a sample from channel #5, and Figure 14 showcases a sample from channel #2. The data char- acteristics across different channels vary. Our model, in contrast to FEDformer, adeptly learns the similarities and differences across various channels, underscoring the significance of channel-wise attention. Compared to iTransformer, our model captures more Figure 9: Depiction of the cf dim parameter influence, detail- ing MSE accuracy across various settings. Parameter values are plotted on the x-axis against MSE accuracy on the y-axis. Trials surpassing our final result accuracy are marked in pur- ple, whereas those falling short are in yellow.

Similar to Section 2.2, the line graph dis- plays the frequency amplitudes, and the heat map shows the model relative error for four components over increasing epochs. We fo- cus on mid-to-high frequency features here, where the amplitudes of these four key components, 𝑘1, 𝑘2, 𝑘3, and 𝑘4, are significantly lower than low-frequency components, successfully capturing these components indicates the model ability to mitigate frequency bias. After training, our method accurately identifies 𝑘1, 𝑘2, and 𝑘3, with Fredformer iTransformer・Real data Fedfromer Figure 13: Visualization of forecasting results (𝐻 = 336).

Despite a larger learning error for 𝑘4, Δ𝑘4 consistently diminishes. This performance contrasts with all baselines, which demonstrate a lack of effectiveness in capturing these frequency components, with unequal reductions in relative errors. G DETAILS OF THE LEMMA 1 Here, we give more details of Lemma.1 in Sec.4. First, we illustrate the full-spectrum normalization as: W ∗ = {𝜎 (W1 . . . W𝑁 )} This shows why normalizing the entire spectrum together does not address the disparity in amplitude across different frequency bands W𝑛, failing to remove amplitude bias between key frequency components, that is, max(W∗ 𝑛) > max(W∗ 𝑚) (4) Then, we furthermore illustrate why time domain patching opera- tion and normalization: {𝜎 (Wt1) . . . 𝜎 (Wt𝑁 )} = {𝜎 (W1 . . . W𝑁 )} (5) where Wt represents a series of time-domain patches of X.

Here, we furthermore discuss why this operation does not solve the issue of amplitude bias among key frequency components: Given the frequency components W𝑛 in the frequency domain and their corresponding time-domain representations Wt𝑛, Parse- val’s theorem provides the foundation for understanding the energy equivalence between the time and frequency domains. Specifically, it states that the total energy in the time domain is equal to the total energy in the frequency domain: 𝑁∑︁ 𝑛=1 ∫ |𝜎 (Wt𝑛)|2𝑑𝑡 = ∫ |𝜎 (W1, . . . , W𝑁 )|2𝑑 𝑓 , where 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎(𝑐𝑑𝑜𝑡) denotes the normalization operation. This theorem underscores the equivalence between applying local nor- malization to patches in the time domain and global normalization across the frequency spectrum. Each point in the time domain can be expressed as the sum of energies from all frequency components at that point. Therefore, a time-domain patch, consisting of 𝑆 points, can be represented as the sum of all frequency components over these 𝑆 points: Patchtime = 𝑆∑︁ 𝑠=1 𝑁∑︁ 𝑛=1 W𝑛 (𝑠), where W𝑛 (𝑠) represents the energy contribution of frequency component 𝑛 at time point 𝑠. Normalizing this time-domain patch equates to normalizing the weights of all frequency components across these 𝑆 points. Mathematically, this normalization can be represented as: 𝜎 (Patchtime) = 𝜎 ( 𝑆∑︁ 𝑠=1 𝑁∑︁ 𝑛=1 W𝑛 (𝑠) ) . However, normalizing within each time-domain patch does not guarantee that the maximum amplitudes across all frequency com- ponents W∗ 𝑛 and W∗ 𝑚 are equalized across different patches. This leads to the critical insight: max(W ∗ 𝑛) > max(W ∗ 𝑚), ∀𝑛, 𝑚, Indicating that local normalization in the time domain, and by ex- tension, global normalization in the frequency domain, does not ef- fectively address the amplitude bias problem among key frequency components. The inherent limitation is that while normalization can adjust the overall energy levels within patches or across the spectrum, it does not inherently correct for discrepancies in the am- plitude distributions among different frequency components. This underscores the necessity for approaches that can specifically target and mitigate amplitude biases to ensure equitable representation and processing of all frequency components. H NYSTRÖM APPROXIMATION IN TRANSFORMER SELF-ATTENTION MECHANISM Overview: To streamline the attention computation, we select 𝑚 landmarks by averaging rows or columns of the attention matrix, simplifying the matrices Q𝑛 and K𝑛 into ˜Q𝑛 and ˜K𝑛. The Nyström approximation for the 𝑛-th channel-wise attention A𝑛 is then cal- culated as A𝑛 ≈ ˜A𝑛 = ˜F𝑛 ˜A𝑛 ˜B𝑛, where ˜F𝑛 = softmax(Q𝑛 ˜K𝑛𝑇 ), ˜A𝑛 = softmax( ˜Q𝑛 ˜K𝑛𝑇 )+, ˜B𝑛 = softmax( ˜Q𝑛K𝑛𝑇 ). Here, ˜A𝑛 + is the Fredformer: Frequency Debiased Transformer for Time Series Forecasting KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Moore-Penrose inverse of ˜A𝑛 [45]. This significantly reducing the computational load from 𝑂 ( 𝐿 𝑃 𝐶2) to 𝑂 ( 𝐿 𝑃 𝐶). Specifically: Details: We reduce the computational cost of self-attention in the Transformer encoder using the Nyström method. Following, we describe how to use the Nyström method to approximate the softmax matrix in self-attention by sampling a subset of columns and rows. Consider the softmax matrix in self-attention, defined as: 𝑆 = softmax ( 𝑄𝐾𝑇 √︁ 𝑑𝑞 ) This matrix can be partitioned as: 𝑆 = [ 𝐴𝑆 𝐵𝑆 𝐹𝑆 𝐶𝑆 ] Where 𝐴𝑆 is derived by sampling 𝑚 columns and rows from 𝑆. By employing the Nyström method, the SVD of 𝐴𝑆 is given by: 𝐴𝑆 = 𝑈 Λ𝑉 𝑇 Using this, an approximation ˆ𝑆 of 𝑆 can be constructed: ˆ𝑆 = [ 𝐴𝑆 𝐵𝑆 𝐹𝑆 𝐹𝑆𝐴+ 𝑆 𝐵𝑆 ] Where 𝐴+ 𝑆 is the Moore-Penrose inverse of 𝐴𝑆 . To further elaborate on the approximation, given a query 𝑞𝑖 and a key 𝑘 𝑗 , let: K (𝑞𝑖, 𝐾) = softmax ( 𝑞𝑖𝐾𝑇 √︁ 𝑑𝑞 ) K (𝑄, 𝑘 𝑗 ) = softmax ( 𝑄𝑘𝑇 𝑗 √︁ 𝑑𝑞 ) From the above, we can derive: 𝜙 (𝑞𝑖, 𝐾) = Λ− 1 2 𝑉 𝑇 K (𝑞𝑖, 𝐾)𝑚×1 𝜙 (𝑄, 𝑘 𝑗 ) = Λ− 1 2 𝑈 𝑇 K (𝑄, 𝑘 𝑗 )𝑚×1 Thus, the Nyström approximation for a particular entry in ˆ𝑆 is: ˆ𝑆𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜙 (𝑞𝑖, 𝐾) 𝑇 𝜙 (𝑄, 𝑘 𝑗 ) In matrix form, ˆ𝑆 can be represented as: ˆ𝑆 = softmax ( 𝑄𝐾𝑇 √︁ 𝑑𝑞 ) 𝑛×𝑚 𝐴+ 𝑆 softmax ( 𝑄𝐾𝑇 √︁ 𝑑𝑞 ) 𝑚×𝑛 This method allows for the approximation of the softmax matrix in self-attention, potentially offering computational benefits. I DETAILED RESULTS OF ALL DATASETS Here, we show the detailed forecasting results of full datasets in the Table. I. The best and second best results are highlighted. With a default look-back window of 𝐿 = 96, our proposal shows lead- ing performance on most datasets and different prediction length settings, with 60 top-1 (29 + 31) cases out of 80 in total.
