Predict failures before they become dangerous Incident • After 3 battery explosions in March 2022, SENEC contracted ACCURE for its battery safety analytics software. Outcome • ACCURE identified additional safety hazards based on operational data. • After SENEC addressed urgent safety issues, it brought ~65,000 battery systems back online. • ACCURE continuously monitors the fleet. 15 CASE STUDY: BATTERY SAFETY 01.12.2022 ACCURE offers the right product for your use case 16 PRODUCT OVERVIEW 01.12.2022 We cooperate with insurances!
