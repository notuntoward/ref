Cloud cover eﬀect of clear-sky index distributions and diﬀerences between human and automatic cloud observations Christopher J. Smitha,b,∗, Jamie M. Brighta, Rolf Crooka aEnergy Research Institute, School of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK bInstitute for Climate and Atmospheric Science, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK Abstract The statistics of clear-sky index can be used to determine solar irradiance when the theoretical clear sky irradiance and the cloud cover are known. In this paper, observations of hourly clear- sky index for the years of 2010–2013 at 63 locations in the UK are analysed for over 1 million data hours. The aggregated distribution of clear-sky index is bimodal, with strong contributions from mostly-cloudy and mostly-clear hours, as well as a lower number of intermediate hours. The clear-sky index exhibits a distribution of values for each cloud cover bin, measured in eighths of the sky covered (oktas), and also depends on solar elevation angle. Cloud cover is measured either by a human observer or automatically with a cloud ceilometer. Irradiation (time-integrated irradiance) values corresponding to human observations of “cloudless” skies (0 oktas) tend to agree better with theoretical clear-sky values, which are calculated with a radiative transfer model, than irradiation values corresponding to automated observations of 0 oktas. It is apparent that the cloud ceilometers incorrectly categorise more non-cloudless hours as cloudless than human observers do. This leads to notable diﬀerences in the distributions of clear-sky index for each okta class, and between human and automated observations. Two probability density functions—the Burr (type III) for mostly-clear situations, and generalised gamma for mostly-cloudy situations—are suggested as analytical ﬁts for each cloud coverage, observation type, and solar elevation angle bin. For human observations of overcast skies (8 oktas) where solar elevation angle exceeds 10◦, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the observed clear-sky indices and the generalised gamma distribution ﬁts.

Introduction1 The most reliable way to determine the solar resource for a particular location, assuming2 there have been no detectable eﬀects of climatic change, is to set up long-term pyranometer3 observations. For many sites of interest, pyranometer records are not frequently obtained for4 a suﬃciently long period prior to installation of a solar energy system (Gueymard and Wilcox,5 2011). Other meteorological variables such as sunshine hours (˚Angstr¨om, 1924; Muneer et al.,6 1998; Prescott, 1940), diurnal temperature range (Bristow and Campbell, 1984; de Jong and7 Stewart, 1993; Hargreaves et al., 1985; Supit and van Kappel, 1998), precipitation (de Jong and8 Stewart, 1993), cloud type (Kasten and Czeplak, 1980; Matuszko, 2012) and fractional cloud9 cover (Brinsﬁeld et al., 1984; Kasten and Czeplak, 1980; Matuszko, 2012; Muneer and Gul,10 2000; Nielsen et al., 1981; Supit and van Kappel, 1998; W¨orner, 1967) can be used to estimate11 solar irradiance. Temperature, pressure, cloud cover, cloud type, rainfall and sunshine hours12 are routinely measured at weather stations globally.13 Since clouds are the largest attenuating factors of solar irradiance in large areas of the globe14 (Wacker et al., 2015), cloud cover is a useful predictor of solar resource (Kasten and Czeplak,15 1980). If the sky is cloudless, irradiance can be predicted from the solar geometry, surface16 albedo, and optical properties of aerosols, ozone and water vapour using a radiative transfer17 calculation (M¨uller et al., 2012). Alternatively, several clear-sky models exist in the literature18 which are empirical relationships between one or more of these atmospheric variables (or of19 2 NomenclatureProbability distribution scale parameter c Burr (type III) distribution shape parameter d Generalised gamma distribution shape parameter ei Expected frequency of clear-sky index observations G surface global horizontal irradiation (J m−2) G0 top-of-atmosphere global horizontal irradiation (J m−2) Gcs clear sky surface global horizontal irradiation (J m−2) k Burr (type III) distribution shape parameter Kc clear-sky index KT clearness index N cloud cover (oktas) oi Observed frequency of clear-sky index observations p Generalised gamma distribution shape parameter Γ(·) Gamma function θe solar elevation angle, ◦ χ2 Goodness-of-ﬁt statistic their derived quantities) and clear-sky irradiance (Gueymard, 2012). When clouds are present,20 the fraction of time clouds obscure the sun, the optical thickness of the clouds, and secondary21 eﬀects such as reﬂections from cloud sides and between cloud layers, can all have important22 eﬀects on the proportion of irradiance that reaches the surface. Cloud transmission is therefore23 the most uncertain component of surface irradiance in most locations.24 Typically, cloud cover is recorded at meteorological stations as an integer number of oktas,25 here denoted N , which is the number of eighths of the sky obscured by clouds (Met Oﬃce,26 2010). An additional okta code 9 is used for situations where the sky is obscured by fog, haze27 or other meteorological phenomena. For human observations, a convention is to reserve 0 oktas28 for completely cloudless sky and 8 oktas for completely overcast sky, so the limits of 1 okta and29 7 oktas are extended to almost clear and almost overcast respectively (Jones, 1992). In some30 automated algorithms a diﬀerent convention may be followed, for example recording up to 1/1631 cloudiness as 0 oktas and greater than 15/16 cloudiness as 8 oktas (Wacker et al., 2015).32 Clear-sky index, Kc = G/Gcs, estimates atmospheric attenuation due to clouds by measuring33 the ratio of surface solar irradiance or irradiation G to the corresponding amount that would be34 received under a clear (cloudless) sky, Gcs. It also accounts for the inﬂuence of surface albedo.35 Other cloudless-sky attenuators such as water vapour, ozone and aerosols are retained in the36 calculation of Gcs. The clear-sky index is less dependent on airmass than the commonly used37 clearness index KT = G/G0, where G0 is top-of-atmosphere solar irradiance. Some authors38 3 have worked to reduce this dependence by introducing a rescaling of the clearness index, to39 either map the observed range of clearness indices into the interval 0–1 for each solar elevation40 angle class (Olseth and Skartveit, 1987) (i.e. a normalised clearness index), or to adjust for41 airmass based on clear-sky Linke turbidity values (Perez et al., 1990).42 Previous relationships between N and KT , Kc, or G, have tended to provide a one-to-43 one correspondence between N and the variable of interest (Brinsﬁeld et al., 1984; Kasten44 and Czeplak, 1980; Matuszko, 2012; Muneer and Gul, 2000; Nielsen et al., 1981; Supit and45 van Kappel, 1998; W¨orner, 1967). On the other hand, several authors have described the46 distributions of clearness or clear-sky index parameterised by its longer-term mean (Bendt et al.,47 1981; Graham and Hollands, 1990; Graham et al., 1988; Hollands and Suehrcke, 2013; Jurado48 et al., 1995; Liu and Jordan, 1960; Olseth and Skartveit, 1984, 1987; Suehrcke and McCormick,49 1988) or by airmass (Moreno-Tejera et al., 2016; Tovar et al., 1998). We aim to bring these parts50 together by reporting clear-sky index distributions for each N class, and secondarily binned by51 solar elevation angle. A simpliﬁed distributional approach was provided by the authors in52 Bright et al. (2015) for clear sky and 6, 7 and 8 oktas to estimate cloud transmission in sun-53 obscured minutes and clear breaks, but did not group observations into human and automatic54 cloud retrievals or elevation angle bins, which as will be shown is important.55 The hourly statistics of clear-sky index grouped by N and solar elevation angle would be56 useful in situations where long-term irradiation data were not available, but measurements of57 hourly N were (assuming the hourly solar elevation angle was known or could be determined).58 The probability of transitioning from one N state to the next N state can then be simulated59 with a Markov chain model (e.g. Bright et al. (2015); Ehnberg and Bollen (2005)), and the60 cloud transmission for each hour selected as a random variable from each Kc distribution for61 that N class.62 2. Determining the clear-sky index63 2.1. Relationships between clear-sky index and cloud cover64 Kasten and Czeplak (1980) found an empirical relationship between hourly Kc and hourly65 N using 10 years of data for Hamburg, Germany, for solar elevation angles above 5◦:66 Kc = 1 − 0.75(N/8)3.4 (1) 4 where the clear-sky irradiance [W m−2] is modelled as67 Gcs = 910 sin θe − 30. (2) where θe is solar elevation angle in degrees. The attenuation coeﬃcient of 0.75 in eq. (1) is68 an overall average over all cloud types, and varies from 0.39 for cirriform clouds to 0.84 for69 nimbostratus. This relationship was later found to be valid for 5 UK sites by Muneer and Gul70 (2000), where slightly better ﬁts can be obtained by tuning coeﬃcients for each site. Other,71 more complex relationships for G as a function of cloud cover were developed by Nielsen et al.72 (1981) and Brinsﬁeld et al. (1984). Matuszko (2012) tabulated observed 10-minutely irradiance73 by okta class and solar elevation angle band for Krakow, Poland.74 Cloud cover can indicate how likely it is that the sun is obscured by clouds (e.g. Muneer75 and Gul (2000)). It does not however provide any information as to how opaque the clouds76 are to solar irradiance. Clear-sky index can take a wide variety of values for each N class. For77 example, a sky could be overcast (N = 8) with thin cirrus clouds or thick nimbostratus clouds.78 In this case, Kc has been observed to vary from 0.07 for overcast nimbostratus to 1.00 for79 overcast cirrus (Matuszko, 2012). Kasten and Czeplak (1980) reported long-term averages of80 0.16 for nimbostratus and 0.61 for cirriform clouds. Although Brinsﬁeld et al. (1984) considers81 opaque clouds in their formulations, the various optical depths of both translucent and opaque82 clouds that are observed may still produce a distribution of results. As shown in Bright et al.83 (2015), the distributions of Kc for 6, 7 and 8 oktas can take a wide range of values. For these84 reasons, the distributional spread of Kc for a particular cloud coverage of N oktas can be more85 useful than its mean or median value.86 2.2. Observational data87 The meteorological observations of cloud cover and solar irradiation are taken from four88 years (2010–2013) of the network of UK Met Oﬃce Integrated Data Archive System (MIDAS)89 stations (Met Oﬃce, 2012). Several datasets are available to registered users at the British90 Atmospheric Data Centre (http://badc.nerc.ac.uk). The UK Hourly Weather Observation91 data (WH) and Global Radiation Observations (RO) were used. Included within the WH data,92 amongst several other meteorological variables, are observations of hourly N , and whether the93 5 1395 1415 1285 1302 842 862 779 30620 811 1198 19206 676 692 461 708 726 440 775 1161 1190 669 643 19187 595 556 583 395 1046 1145 1144 57199 55511 17314 533 384 370 1568 57063 56963 1450 1467 1033 1023 1083 315 18974 105 1007 24125 212 19260 235 268 177 54 67 44 79 113 132 23 161 9 Figure 1: MIDAS stations that provide quality-controlled hourly irradiation and cloud cover observations for 2010–2013. Station numbers refer to MIDAS station IDs. The strength of shading indicates the proportion of observations that were observed by a human (15% grey corresponds to 0% human observations, scaling linearly to 100% black representing 100% human observations). The lines of longitude and latitude mark the boundaries of each GLOMAP aerosol climatology grid cell. observation was automatic or human-observed. The hourly irradiation G is taken from the94 RO data. Both datasets indicate the date and time of the observation and the station ID95 code. Data were used when observations of G and N exist for the same station and hourly96 timestamp, and both pass internal Met Oﬃce quality control checks as indicated by state ﬂags97 for each observation. An additional screening procedure was implemented to remove duplicate98 observations. One station contained only two hours of valid data for the four years, and this99 station was also disregarded. Further checks removed observations with unrealistically high100 clearness index values as described in section 2.4.5. A total of 1,121,334 hourly observations101 were retained from 63 MIDAS stations across the UK. The locations of these stations are shown102 in ﬁg. 1.103 6 2.3. Cloud cover observational practice104 Cloud cover observations can either be made by a human observer or a cloud ceilometer,105 which uses a laser to detect cloud bases automatically (WMO, 2014). In recent years, the106 UK Met Oﬃce has moved towards fully automated weather measurements at most stations,107 but human observers are still present at some research stations and airﬁelds during operational108 hours1. This reﬂects observational practice in many other countries (Dai et al., 2006; Perez et al.,109 2001; Wauben et al., 2006). A previous study has found that human and automated methods110 can produce quite diﬀerent results, with agreements in N between human and automated111 observations occurring for 39% of hours and agreements within ±2 oktas occurring for 88% of112 hours in the Netherlands (Wauben et al., 2006). Wacker et al. (2015) found that ceilometer113 observations of cloud cover tend to be biased low compared to those observed by a human in114 Switzerland. A human observer typically makes a subjective judgement of the cloud-obscured115 proportion of the entire visible sky dome at the end of a reporting period (e.g. every hour in116 the WH data), while a cloud ceilometer consists of a zenith-pointing device that records the117 amount of time that a laser beam was intercepted by clouds divided by the length of the period118 (Dai et al., 2006).119 The solar irradiation data collected by MIDAS stations are hourly totals. Solar irradiation120 is measured using Kipp & Zonen CMP10 and CMP11 pyranometers, with cleaning, level-121 checking and recalibration performed on a regular basis including at fully automated sites2. As122 irradiation is recorded hourly, there can be a timing mismatch between the dominant conditions123 of the hour and the cloud amount recorded at the end of the hour by a human observer if clouds124 accumulate or disperse during the hour. The automatic ceilometer method assumes that the125 clouds overpassing the zenith during the hour are representative of the entire sky conditions,126 which are not always case if clouds are localised in one part of the sky, giving a spatial mismatch127 between recorded clouds and actual cloud cover. Furthermore, thin cloud is sometimes not128 detected by the laser and fog can be mistaken for low-level overcast conditions. The distinction129 of whether an observation was made by a human or was automatic is an important one and is130 taken into account in the analysis.131 1Personal communication with a member of the British Atmospheric Data Centre team. 2Personal communication with a member of the Met Oﬃce surface radiation team. 7 2.4. Generation of clear sky solar irradiance132 For this study, Gcs is simulated using a radiative transfer simulation with prescribed atmo-133 spheric constituents. The advantages of this are that climatological values of the main clear-sky134 solar attenuators can be input into the model to quickly generate an estimate of clear-sky ir-135 radiance that is location- and month-dependent. For 0 oktas, this also gives an indication of136 natural variability in atmospheric transmission of clear skies around the climatological mean137 value. A further reason for this approach that is shown in section 3 is that the cloud cover ob-138 servation method (human or automated) determines the shape of each cloud cover observation139 bin, including 0 oktas.140 2.4.1. Atmosphere141 The two-stream solution to the discrete-ordinate radiative transfer method (Kylling et al.,142 1995), implemented in the libRadtran software package (Mayer and Kylling, 2005), is used to143 calculate clear-sky irradiance. The background atmosphere for mixed gases concentration is144 provided by the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory (AFGL) mid-latitude summer atmosphere145 for April–September and mid-latitude winter for October–March (Anderson et al., 1986). Air146 temperature, and ozone and water vapour mass mixing ratios, on 60 model levels for each147 month of 2010–2013 from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)148 ERA-Interim reanalysis data, provide the climatological atmospheric conditions. These data149 are taken on a spatial grid of 1.5◦ × 1.5◦. A pseudo-spherical correction is implemented in150 the radiative transfer code, which accounts for the curvature of the earth’s atmosphere and151 improves the accuracy of clear-sky irradiance calculations at low sun.152 2.4.2. Aerosols153 Aerosols are highly spatially and temporally variable and may lead to the highest uncertainty154 in the calculated clear-sky irradiance values. Point measurements of aerosol conditions are made155 by the AERONET network, but are only possible under favourable conditions and some sites156 experience several months without a valid observation. Another technique considered was to157 estimate aerosol conditions based on retrieved values of horizontal visibility from the WH data,158 but this was found to consistently underestimate clear-sky irradiance and actually increased,159 rather than reduced, the ranges of Kc observed. Therefore, aerosol optical properties are taken160 from the Global Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP) model (Scott et al., 2014; Spracklen161 8 et al., 2005), which provides aerosol optical depth, single scattering albedo and asymmetry162 factor in 6 solar shortwave bands on 31 atmospheric levels for each month. The native GLOMAP163 spatial grid of 2.8◦ × 2.8◦ is used without interpolation, which divides the UK into 11 aerosol164 zones (shown in ﬁg. 1).165 2.4.3. Surface albedo166 Surface albedo from the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) library at167 a resolution of 1 6 ◦ × 1 6 ◦ has been used (Belward and Loveland, 1996). One issue with using168 the same surface type for the full year may be to underestimate the albedo from snow-covered169 surfaces in winter. Radiative transfer simulations performed by the authors suggest that a170 perfectly reﬂecting surface predicts about 13% higher downwards irradiance than a perfectly171 absorbing surface due to multiple reﬂections between atmosphere and the ground under clear172 sky. This result is consistent for all solar elevation angles. Real surfaces are not totally absorbing173 and snow-covered surfaces are not totally reﬂective. The errors introduced for global horizontal174 radiation (GHI) by using an incorrect surface albedo are therefore likely to be smaller than 13%175 under clear sky conditions. The overall impact is expected to be small as this phenomenon will176 only aﬀect a few winter days each year.177 2.4.4. Solar position178 To match the clear-sky simulation to observation as accurately as possible, an accurate179 representation of solar elevation angle is required. Met Oﬃce data recording conventions state180 that the observation recorded for each UTC hour (SYNOP climate message) is taken 10 minutes181 before the hour (Met Oﬃce, 2015a). For solar irradiation (HCM climate message), the time182 period of data collection runs from 70 minutes to 10 minutes before the observation time stamp183 (at the end of every UTC hour). libRadtran provides the Blanco-Muriel et al. (2001) algorithm184 for calculating solar elevation angle, which provides long-term accuracy for solar elevation185 within 0.1◦. The eﬀective solar elevation angle is calculated centred at 40 minutes prior to186 each hour of each day at each MIDAS station by taking a sum of 61 minutely samples of the187 solar elevation angle between 70 and 10 minutes before the observation time stamp, inclusive.188 Solar elevation angles below 0◦ are excluded from the sum, and the sum of the minutely sines189 of elevation angle are divided by the number of minutes in which the sun is above the horizon190 to obtain the eﬀective sine of elevation angle. This calculation is again performed internally in191 9 libRadtran.192 This procedure of obtaining an eﬀective solar elevation angle corresponds to practice A3 of193 Blanc and Wald (2016). It is found that this practice predicts direct normal irradiance (DNI)194 with a RMSE of 4% for all elevation angles and 24% for elevation angles below 15◦ (Blanc195 and Wald, 2016) at the high-quality BSRN site at Payerne, Switzerland. This is better than196 assuming that the elevation angle corresponding to the middle of the hour is representative,197 however a more accurate practice (A5) involves taking the inverse sine of the ratio of direct198 horizontal irradiation to direct normal irradiation (Blanc and Wald, 2016). This practice has199 not been implemented in this work as the hourly DNI is not available in libRadtran.200 2.4.5. Additional quality control check201 After calculating Kc and obtaining θe for each valid hour, an additional screening procedure202 was implemented to remove all observations where the clearness index KT exceeded 0.85. This203 is on the basis that hourly clearness indices exceeding 0.85 are very rarely, if ever, observed204 in high-quality data (NREL, 1993; Vignola et al., 2012). This additional constraint excluded205 0.34% of observations, the majority of which were at very low elevation angles where small206 errors in the calculated solar position can cause large errors in the ratios of Kc and KT .207 3. Distributions of clear-sky index208 3.1. Aggregated observations209 Figure 2 shows the overall distribution of clear-sky index from all 63 weather stations in210 all cloud conditions. The distribution is bimodal with contributions from cloudless hours near211 Kc = 1 and cloudy hours near Kc = 0.3. There are a lower number of observations for212 intermediate clear-sky indices. Bimodal behaviour for hourly normalised (scaled to the range213 0–1) clearness index observations has been observed in Norway and Vancouver (Olseth and214 Skartveit, 1987), and it is reasonable to expect a similar pattern for clear-sky index would also215 occur in the similar maritime climate of the UK. The clear sky mode at Kc = 1 shows that216 the radiative transfer simulation with prescribed albedo, aerosol, H2O and O3 climatologies217 provides a good estimate of irradiation in cloudless skies.218 There are a number of observations from hours where Kc is much larger than 1 indicating219 signiﬁcantly more solar irradiation than would be expected under cloudless conditions for a220 10 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Clear-sky index 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4Frequency density Figure 2: Histogram of all hourly Kc observations from 63 UK weather stations, 2010–2013 11 number of hours, despite rejection of values where KT > 0.85. For hourly data, it is expected221 that the averaging time would cause short-term cloud enhancement eﬀects to cancel out. It is222 however possible that cloud enhancement eﬀects could inﬂuence the hourly Kc value if clouds223 tend to group in, or avoid, one region of the sky due to geographical features, such as mountains224 or coastlines.225 3.2. Distribution by solar elevation angle226 In ﬁg. 3, the clear-sky index histograms are grouped into bins of elevation angle from 0–10◦,227 10–20◦ and so on up to the top group of 50–63◦. These histograms reveal diﬀerent characteristics228 of the clear-sky index distribution in each elevation angle bin. The θe ≤ 10◦ bin is unimodal229 showing the greatest accumulation of Kc values around 0.3–0.4. The spread of values is the230 largest for any solar elevation class, and this group is also responsible for a large majority of231 the extremely high, Kc > 1.2, observations. For the 10◦ < θe ≤ 20◦ bin, the bimodal shape of232 the distribution starts to become apparent. Low Kc values are still more common, and there233 is a lower frequency of extremely high observations. As elevation angle increases, the Kc ≈ 1234 “spike” of the distribution becomes sharper and higher than the low Kc “hump”, which starts235 to ﬂatten out and become more uniform, and instances of Kc > 1.2 virtually disappear. In the236 top elevation angle group the greatest value of Kc barely exceeds 1.1.237 It is therefore shown that high Kc values are more likely to occur at low solar elevation angle238 bins, and that Kc is not independent of solar elevation angle for the choices of inputs used in239 the radiative transfer model. There are several reasons why a large spread, including some very240 large, Kc values can occur for θe ≤ 10◦. At low sun under scattered clouds, reﬂections from241 the undersides of clouds can enhance diﬀuse irradiance, or clouds near the horizon in the solar242 direction can forward-scatter sunlight. If this happens due to clouds preferentially grouping in243 one part of the sky, this may lead to consistently high Kc values for low solar elevation angles as244 a result of non-cancelling cloud enhancement eﬀects. The eﬀect of snow in winter and how this245 enhances surface clear-sky irradiance has been described previously. Under clouds, multiple246 reﬂections between snow-covered ground and cloud bases may enhance irradiance under all-sky247 conditions, and this eﬀect may be greater than the 13% calculated for clear-sky conditions. One248 reason for the lack of high Kc spike is that where clouds are present, transmitted irradiance249 may be lower at low solar elevations as both solar beam path through the cloud is longer, and250 12 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0 ◦ <θe 10 ◦ 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 10 ◦ <θe 20 ◦ 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 20 ◦ <θe 30 ◦ 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 30 ◦ <θe 40 ◦ 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 40 ◦ <θe 50 ◦ 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 50 ◦ <θe 63 ◦ Clear-sky indexFrequency density Figure 3: Histograms of observation of clear-sky index by solar elevation angle 13 θe = 60° θe = 15° (a) (b) Figure 4: Schematic of cloud shading for the same (ﬁctional) cloud for solar elevation angle of (a) 60◦ and (b) 15◦. Both the shaded area (light grey) and the maximum path length of the solar beam (arrow through cloud) increases at low solar elevation angles. cloud shadows project a greater area (ﬁg. 4). None of these eﬀects are sources of error and251 represent real-world phenomena; they must therefore be included in the distributions.252 Extreme high values of Kc could also be due to errors either in measurement or calcula-253 tion. DNI reported by pyranometers becomes less reliable at low solar elevations due to cosine254 response errors (Vignola et al., 2012). When generating Kc values, the hourly sine-weighted255 mean elevation angle may not be adequately representative of all conditions during the hours256 of sunrise and sunset. Furthermore, UK Met Oﬃce practice of recording measurements at 10257 minutes before the hour may not have been observed at all stations, or errors in the clock time258 at the MIDAS site may be present3. Large diﬀerences between sin θe at the start and end of the259 hour can account for this. Although the pseudo-spherical correction for the curvature of the260 earth’s atmosphere is made in the radiative transfer code, all instances where θe < 0◦ are set to261 zero in the hourly averaging of zenith angle. In reality a small amount of diﬀuse irradiance at262 dusk and dawn is present and would contribute to the total received by a pyranometer. Finally,263 the impact of horizon obstructions can cause instances of otherwise clear sky receiving a low264 Kc value.265 3The datasets were originally analysed without the 10-minute oﬀset where it was observed that the distribu- tional spread was much greater, indicating that the practice has been implemented at the majority of MIDAS stations if not all. 14 54 67 44 79 113 132 23 161 9 18974 105 1007 24125 212 19260 235 268 177 1568 57063 56963 1450 1467 1033 1023 1083 315 1046 1145 1144 57199 55511 17314 533 384 370 1161 1190 669 643 19187 595 556 583 395 1198 19206 676 692 461 708 726 440 775 1395 1415 1285 1302 842 862 779 30620 811 East →North → Clear-sky index distributions for 63 UKMO MIDAS stations Figure 5: Histograms of Kc for each individual MIDAS station.

Distribution by MIDAS weather station266 Owing to the inﬂuence of weather systems from the Atlantic and the rain-shielding eﬀect267 of hills and mountains such as the Pennines, the western side of the British Isles typically268 experiences more rainfall than the eastern side (Met Oﬃce, 2015b). To investigate whether269 this pattern is prevalent in cloud transmission, the Kc distribution from each of the 63 MIDAS270 stations in ﬁg. 1 is investigated individually.271 The 63 stations are grouped into a 7 × 9 grid by sorting the station latitudes in order from272 south to north and then from west to east across each band. In ﬁg. 5, the distribution of Kc for273 each weather station is shown. The proportion of human observations at each station is denoted274 by the strength of the shading. A total of 17 stations have at least some human observations,275 ranging from 19% to 99% of the total for that station.276 Most individual stations exhibit the bimodal characteristic of clear-sky index that is a277 15 feature of the aggregated distribution in ﬁg. 2. Some individual stations, typically located in278 Scotland and Northern Ireland, have a low or non-existent clear-sky spike showing a tendency279 for cloudiness. From south to north, there is a slight trend for a decrease in overall cloud280 transmission by comparing the frequency densities of the low Kc humps, but this varies from281 station to station, and could be an consequence of the annually averaged lower solar elevation282 angles at these latitudes. There does not appear to be an overall trend in the west to east283 direction. It should be borne in mind that diﬀerences in instrumental response and local284 microclimates may aﬀect the Kc values produced from individual stations. On the whole,285 there are no clear systematic diﬀerences between stations by observation method for total Kc286 distributions.287 3.4. Distribution of cloud cover by solar elevation angle288 The diﬀerences in the shape of the Kc distributions for each elevation angle bin could be289 an indication of generally fairer weather conditions at higher solar elevation angles, or could290 be a result in the reduction of the variance in Kc values in genuinely clear hours that cause291 observations to contract towards Kc = 1. The cloud cover habits for each elevation angle class292 have been investigated. It is conﬁrmed that clearer conditions are not generally more likely at293 higher solar elevation angle bins as shown in ﬁg. 6.294 Figure 6 shows there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between cloud cover reporting for the human295 and automatic methods across all solar elevation angles. Automated cloud systems are much296 more likely (14–19% of hours) to record 0 oktas than human observers (1% of hours). There297 is also a tendency for the automated recording system to record 8 oktas more commonly than298 the human observers (33–40% of the time compared to 19–24%). For both 8 oktas and 0 oktas,299 there is an elevation angle dependency for automated observations, with these classes more300 likely to be recorded at lower elevation angle bins. For human observations, this pattern is seen301 with 1 okta and 8 oktas. Conversely, for human observers 7 oktas is most commonly recorded302 with 36% or 37% of observations (no detectable elevation angle dependency), whereas 7 oktas303 is recorded only 18–22% of the time in the automated observations, increasing with elevation304 angle. Intermediate (1 ≤ N ≤ 6) cloudiness is more likely to be noted by human observers305 across all elevation angle bins. The diﬀerences in N frequency between the two methods may306 be partially due to the recording convention for human observers of 0 oktas representing totally307 16 Figure 6: Heat map of okta frequency count for each elevation angle bin for (a) human and (b) automated cloud cover observations. Percentages and shading colour relates to the fraction of each elevation angle class (column) assigned to each cloud okta class. Columns may not sum to 100% due to rounding. cloudless skies and 8 oktas representing fully overcast skies. Any cloud presence, however small,308 should be recorded as 1 okta, and likewise a small break in an otherwise overcast sky should309 be recorded as 7 oktas. It is unlikely that a ceilometer would “hit” a small isolated cloud or310 cloud-break over the course of an hour, therefore classifying more “true” 1 okta hours as 0311 oktas, and “true” 7 okta hours as 8 oktas.312 The lack of Kc ≈ 1 spike for the θe ≤ 10◦ bin is unlikely to be due to signiﬁcantly higher313 cloudiness for these observations in both the human-observed and automated cases. Separate314 analysis shows that the seasonal distribution shapes are similar to the annual ones in ﬁg. 3, with315 a slightly greater tendency to low Kc values in winter where okta 8 is observed more frequently.316 3.5. Distribution by okta and elevation angle317 The distributions at each okta class were subdivided by elevation angle group (ﬁg. 7),318 with separate results provided for human and automated observations. It is seen that this319 division is a necessary one, particularly at low okta classes. The 0 oktas distribution for human320 17 observations is slightly left-skewed at low solar elevation angles, becoming more symmetric321 around Kc = 1 at higher elevations. In contrast, the histograms of automated observations for322 0 oktas exhibit more left skew that does not vanish at the highest elevation angle class. This323 implies that humans are more able to detect cases of genuine clear sky and that the spatial324 mismatch between the observation of N by the ceilometer and the rest of the sky is more serious325 than the temporal mismatch of N recorded by a human at the end of the hour and irradiance326 measured over the course of the hour. For automated observations, it is clear that a signiﬁcant327 number of hours that are not cloudless are being reported as 0 oktas. This results in the left328 skew present at 0 oktas and the heavier weight of the left tails for 1–3 oktas compared to the329 human observations. The left-skew for 0 oktas is still present for human observations, albeit330 smaller.331 When cloud coverage is between 1 and 6 oktas, more of the mass of the distributions332 are located to the left for automated observations than for human observations in all solar333 elevation angle bins. This indicates that the automatic method tends to attribute cloudier334 observations to a particular okta value than a human would for intermediate cloudiness. The335 7 okta distributions are roughly similar to ﬁrst order. However, a large diﬀerence occurs in336 “overcast” skies (8 oktas), where humans tend to record a greater proportion of low Kc hours337 than the ceilometer. This would suggest that humans are generally more able to correctly338 identify genuine instances of overcast sky than ceilometers.339 The general pattern for both observation types where θe > 10◦ is for severe left-skew at 0340 oktas, which becomes gradually milder up to 6 oktas. The distribution for 7 oktas shows a mild341 right-skew, and 8 oktas and the sky-obscured state are more heavily right-skewed. Except for342 N = 8 and the obscured sky state, the distributions of observed Kc is qualitatively diﬀerent343 for the θe ≤ 10◦ group than for other elevation angles.344 One explanation for the diﬀerences in distribution shape by elevation angle class for cloud345 coverages of 0–7 oktas are the relative probabilities of the solar beam being obscured by cloud346 (assuming that some observations of 0 oktas have been incorrectly classiﬁed as clear). At low347 solar elevations, the solar path length through the atmosphere is longer than at high elevations,348 and the probability of the sun being obscured by a cloud increases. This is true for both349 human and automated observations, but as the ceilometer method only records the conditions350 18012345678 < 10◦obsc. 10 - 20◦ 20 - 30◦ 30 - 40◦ 40 - 50◦ > 50◦ human observations automated observations Clear-sky index by elevation angle and cloud fraction Solar elevation angleOkta Figure 7: Matrix of histograms of Kc values for each okta class and solar elevation angle band for human and automated cloud observations. The x-axes run from 0 to 1.5 with ticks in intervals of 0.2; the y-axes are probability density which has not been standardised between subplots for clarity. Marked ﬁts correspond to the distributions described in sections 3.6.1 and 3.6.2. 19 in the zenith direction, the probability of a cloud not being detected is much higher. A related351 eﬀect was noticed by Muneer and Gul (2000) who found that the relationship between hourly352 sunshine fraction and cloud coverage was dependent on solar elevation and was not linear. Low353 observed values of Kc at 0 oktas for θe ≤ 10◦ could be eﬀects from horizon obstruction, ground354 reﬂection, small errors in zenith angle for sunrise/sunset hours, or other diﬀerences as described355 in section 3.2.356 3.6. Fitting statistical distributions357 The aim of ﬁtting statistical distributions to each okta, elevation angle class and observation358 type histogram is to be able to use each distribution to generate random variables of clear-sky359 index. Such a method can be used in a Markov chain model of hourly cloud coverage (Bright360 et al., 2015; Ehnberg and Bollen, 2005). The highly negatively-skewed low okta classes pro-361 vide a particular challenge as positively-skewed distributions tend to appear more commonly362 in natural processes (McLaughlin, 2014). A candidate distribution that ﬁts all okta and el-363 evation classes fairly well is the four-parameter skew-t distribution (Azzalini and Capitanio,364 2003), which can handle both severe positive and negative skew as well as high kurtosis. A365 computational drawback of the skew-t distribution is the lack of an analytic form for the cumu-366 lative distribution function which prevents fast computation of random variables. Therefore,367 to promote distributions where analytic forms were possible, the cases of “mostly clear”, where368 distributions are typically and sometimes extremely left-skewed, and “mostly cloudy”, where369 distributions are approximately symmetric to mildly right-skewed, are considered separately.370 The boundary between cases depends on the method used to retrieve the cloud cover observa-371 tion, and “mostly clear” is deﬁned as 5 oktas or less for human observations and 3 oktas or less372 for automated observations (approximately 30% of observations in both cases).373 3.6.1. “Mostly clear” hours: the Burr distribution374 The probability density function (PDF) of the Burr (type III) distribution is given by (Burr,375 1942; Tadikamalla, 1980)376 f (x) = ck a ( x a )−c−1 (1 + ( x a )−c)−k−1 (3) where c and k are positive shape parameters and a is a positive scale parameter.377 20 3.6.2. “Mostly cloudy” hours: the generalised gamma distribution378 The generalised gamma is a superset of several common distributions used in mathemat-379 ics and engineering, and includes the gamma, exponential, Weibull, chi-squared, normal and380 lognormal distributions as special or limiting cases. The PDF is given by (Stacy, 1962)381 f (x) = pxd−1 exp(−(x/a)p) adΓ(d/p) (4) where a is a positive scale parameter, d and p are shape parameters, and Γ(·) is the gamma382 function that generalises factorials to all real numbers.383 3.6.3. Discussion of statistical ﬁts384 Two additional advantages of the Burr (type III) and generalised gamma models compared385 to the skew-t is the use of one less parameter, and the imposition of Kc = 0 as a lower bound,386 which represents physical reality. In contrast, the skew-t distribution is deﬁned on (−∞, ∞).387 For all distribution histograms, the probability functions were ﬁt using the method of maximum388 likelihood estimation.389 In ﬁg. 7, the histograms have been ﬁt with the Burr (type III) distribution where the cloud390 coverage is 5 oktas or less for human observations and 3 oktas or less for automated observations,391 and the generalised gamma distribution for higher okta classes. In general, the distribution ﬁts392 visually appear to be satisfactory for all solar elevation angle bins excluding the lowest.393 To assess the quality of the ﬁt to the proposed distribution, Pearson’s χ2 test can be per-394 formed to determine whether the hypothesis that data ﬁts the given distribution is appropriate.395 To perform this, the Kc values from each okta and elevation angle class are binned into deciles,396 so that each decile contains a number of observations, oi, that is 10% (to within rounding) of397 the total. The ranges of the bottom and top deciles are extended to Kc values of 0 and +∞398 respectively. Then, for the Kc ranges covered in each decile, the number of observations that399 would be expected in each decile according to the distribution, ei, is calculated from the CDF400 of the distribution. The χ2 statistic is calculated from401 χ2 = 10∑ i=1 (oi − ei)2 ei .

The value of χ2 calculated in eq. (5) is then404 compared to a χ2 distribution with 6 degrees of freedom4. High values of χ2 indicate large405 diﬀerences between the observed and expected bin frequencies. The p-value indicates how406 much of the χ2 distribution lies to the right of the calculated statistic, and can be interpreted407 as how likely a χ2 value that is at least as high as that calculated could occur by random408 chance if the distribution was indeed appropriate. Conventionally, a p-value of 0.05 is used to409 determine whether the distribution ﬁt is acceptable, with values below this implying that there410 is evidence to suggest that the proposed distribution is not acceptable.411 The χ2 values calculated from each okta and elevation angle bin are shown in tables 1412 and 2. It can be seen that instances where the p-value exceeds 0.05 are limited, and as such the413 suggested distribution ﬁts may not be appropriate. However, for human observations, it should414 be noted that for all solar elevation angle classes above 10◦ and cloud coverage of 8 oktas, the415 generalised gamma distribution does provide an appropriate ﬁt using the χ2 test. This suggests416 that where cloud transmission is purely a function of cloud thickness (and is not aﬀected by417 gaps in the clouds), a generalised gamma model is appropriate.418 410 degrees of freedom for each Kc interval, subtract one degree of freedom for the constraint that the sum of oi equals the total number of observations, and subtract another 3 degrees of freedom for each of the parameters ﬁtted by maximum likelihood estimation. 22 Solar elevation angle, automated observations < 10◦ 10◦– 20◦ 20◦– 30◦ 30◦– 40◦ 40◦– 50◦ > 50◦ 0 oktas .0000 .0000 .0000 .0000 .0000 .0000 1 okta .0000 .0000 .0001 .0000 .0000 .0000 2 oktas .0000 .0000 .0001 .3944 .0020 .0256 3 oktas .0000 .0000 .0000 .0001 .0012 .0069 4 oktas .0000 .0000 .0003 .1144 .5354 .0053 5 oktas .0000 .0000 .0217 .0912 .3566 .0037 6 oktas .0000 .0000 .0000 .0003 .0011 .0028 7 oktas .0000 .0000 .0000 .0000 .0001 .0000 8 oktas .0000 .0000 .0000 .0000 .0000 .0000 Sky obscured .0000 .0000 .0000 .0001 .9826 .0130 Table 2: p-values for χ2 goodness-of-ﬁt tests for the distributions shown in ﬁg. 7 for automated observations (dashed lines).

Conclusion419 The hourly clear-sky index distribution for each cloud cover and solar elevation angle bin420 can be a useful tool to predict the distribution of irradiance where long-term data is unavailable421 but knowledge of cloud cover and solar elevation angle is. The hourly cloud transmission of422 solar irradiance due to clouds in the UK is found to follow a bimodal distribution that can be423 attributed to hours that are mostly cloudless (clear-sky index close to 1) and hours that are424 mostly overcast (clear-sky index of 0.2–0.4).425 The clear-sky index distribution for each okta class, and overall cloud coverage distribution,426 is useful to characterise the expected solar irradiance at a site of interest. For low cloudiness,427 the Kc distributions follow a left-skew distribution and for high cloudiness they resemble an428 approximately symmetric to right-skew distribution. For human observations of 8 oktas, with429 solar elevation angle greater than 10◦, there is no evidence to reject the hypothesis that the430 clear-sky index follows a generalised gamma distribution.431 The most reliable cloud observations are from those sites where a human observer is present.432 This can be determined by the fact that the distribution shapes are more symmetric and433 grouped nearer to Kc = 1 for 0 oktas, whereas there is a heavier left tail present for the 0434 okta distributions from automated observations. Figures 6 and 7 show that the ceilometer435 method probably overestimates the occurrences of 0 oktas and 8 oktas and underestimates436 intermediate cloud coverages. As meteorological observations are increasingly likely to be made437 automatically in the future, it is important that a distinction be made to classify observations438 23 as human-observed or automated, or that algorithms are developed to consistently convert439 automated observations to an equivalent value that a human would estimate. The diﬀerences440 in distribution values for human and automated observations would suggest that the overall441 distribution of okta observations have changed over time as the network has become more442 automated (Dai et al., 2006). This would be an interesting hypothesis to pursue.443 Although clear-sky index is less airmass (elevation angle) dependent than clearness index,444 some dependence remains. Future work could investigate correcting for the eﬀect of solar445 elevation angle in cloudy skies, so that the clear-sky index distribution is a function only of446 cloud cover and cloud optical thickness.447 Notes448 The distribution parameters used for the plots in ﬁg. 7 are available as an electronic ap-449 pendix.450 Acknowledgements451 The authors thank the UK Met Oﬃce for providing the MIDAS RO and WH data through452 the British Atmospheric Data Centre.
