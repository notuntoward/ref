We pay respect to Elders past and present. 2 Background Luke 3 About AEMO 4 Declared Wholesale Gas Market (DWGM) Short Term Trading Market (STTM) and Gas Supply Hub (GSH) • AEMO is a member-based, not-for-profit organisation. • We are the independent energy market and system operator for the National Electricity Market (NEM) and the WA Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM), and system planner for the NEM. • We also operate retail and wholesale gas markets across south-eastern Australia and Victoria’s gas pipeline grid. GasElectricity AEMO Services is an independent subsidiary of AEMO, established in 2021 to enable the transparent provision of advisory and energy services to National Electricity Market jurisdictions. National Electricity Market (NEM) Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) 5 NEM context • The NEM is supporting a once-in-a-century transformation in the way society considers and consumes energy. • Associated with this transformation are a range of factors that influence the resilience of the NEM, such as: • Fewer synchronous generators online. • Increased power transfers through major transmission corridors. • Concentrated provision of contingency frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) in some regions. • The increase in connection of inverter-based resources (IBR) and distributed energy resources (DER) also poses challenges in maintaining grid stability, voltage and frequency control while managing evolving weather-related risks. • These significant changes to the power system also require an increase in the number and complexity of special protection schemes (SPSs) - while SPSs can enhance the resilience of the system, they also have the potential to create additional risks in relation to maloperation of schemes. 6 Managing non-credible contingencies in the NEM • Planning timeframe - e.g. Network Service Provider planning for emergency controls, General Power System Risk Review (GPSRR). • Operational timeframe - e.g. Reclassification of non-credible contingencies, indistinct events, protected events. • Post incident analysis and management - e.g. Reviewable incident reports. 7 Bow-Tie risk assessment approach 8 Evolution of the risk review Luke 9 Evolution of the risk review 10 • The first Power System Frequency Risk Review (PSFRR) was undertaken in 2017 (SA) and 2018 (NEM) in response to a rule change following the 2016 South Australia black system event. • The biennial PSFRR has expanded to include events and conditions that could lead to cascading failures or supply disruptions, with the first annual GPSRR published in 2023. • In accordance with 5.20A of the National Electricity Rules (NER), AEMO is required to undertake a GPSRR. GPSRR • The purpose of the GPSRR to review: • A prioritised set of risks comprising contingency events and other events and conditions that could lead to cascading outages or major supply disruptions. • The current arrangements for managing the identified priority risks and options for their future management. • The arrangements for management of existing protected events and consideration of any changes or revocation. • The performance of existing emergency frequency control schemes and the need for any modifications. The GPSRR achieves this by: • Exploring the risks and consequences of non-credible contingencies, and other system events and conditions that could lead to cascading outages or major supply disruptions. • Considering how these risks evolve over a five-year planning horizon, taking into account potential changes in power system risks within that period. • Building on and complementing other work undertaken by AEMO, such as the Integrated System Plan (ISP), Engineering Roadmap to 100% Renewables, and AEMO risk management initiatives. 11 Identifying priority risks Luke 12 GPSRR approach 13 Key activities required for the 2024 GPSRR are listed below. • Review recent power system events and operational challenges, for example: • Nov 2023 challenges managing minimum synchronous generator operation in NSW • Feb 2024 500kV double circuit trip in Victoria • Engagement with AEMO internal teams and Network Service Providers (NSPs) to finalise the scope of 2024 GPSRR • Review known risks and controls through extensive engagement with NSPs • Cross-departmental brainstorming sessions • Risk evaluation and calibration sessions Event details Likelihood Consequence Mitigations (current / planned) GPSRR approach (cont.) 14 • Write up of proposed GPSRR draft approach paper including: • Proposed risks • Risk assessment process • Modelling approach • Consultation approach • Industry consultation on the 2024 GPSRR draft approach paper • 20 day consultation period and industry Q&A session • Publication of the 2024 GPSRR final approach paper • Taking on board feedback from industry • Undertake the GPSRR including: • Completion of studies on the agreed priority risks • Propose mitigation solutions, such as operational constraints, emergency control schemes, protected events or other • Share draft report and findings with industry for consultation • Publication of the final 2024 GPSRR report. Simulation study methodology Dan 15 Factors considered to determine modelling approaches for GPSRR studies 16 Current risks Future risks EMT studies RMS studies Full NEM model Simplified model Full NEM model for current studies 17 • Full NEM model as downloaded from AEMO Operations and Planning Data Management System (OPDMS), based on historical timestamps of the system • Additional dynamic models are added: • CMLD (composite load model)/DER (distributed energy resources) models • Updated governor settings and generic governor models for hydro, gas, steam • UFLS (under frequency load shedding)/OFGS (over frequency generator shedding) • System protection schemes AEMO CMLD/DER models Load models: CMLD • AEMO composite load model (CMLD) was used to model load response in all GPSRR studies, • Captures load shake off in response to large disturbances • The composite load model consists of six load components • It includes: • three three-phase (3P) induction motor models (Motor A, B and C) • a single-phase (1P) capacitor-start motor performance model (Motor D) • static load components (constant current and constant impedance) • a power electronic load model (constant active and reactive power) 18 DER models: DERAEMO1 19 https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/initiatives/der/2022/psse-models-for-load-and-distributed-pv-in-the-nem.pdf?la=en • DERAEMO1 model used to represent DER in risk review studies • Based on DER_A model developed by WECC (Western Electricity Coordinating Council) • Additional to the DER_A model, the DERAEMO1 model features: • Partial power reduction following an under- frequency or over-frequency event • Partial power reduction following a low or high RoCoF (Rate of Change of Frequency) • Asymmetric reactive power-voltage control • Flexible voltage reference Governor models 20 • Proponent-provided models with site-specific settings including mandatory primary frequency response (PFR) settings • Where site specific settings were not available, AEMO developed generic governor models with PFR settings for steam, gas and hydro units • Droop at connection point set less than or equal to 5% • PFR deadband no wider than +/- 0.015 Hz • Generic models based on: • Steam turbines: IEEEG1SDU • Gas turbines: GGOVDU • Hydro turbines: HYGOVDU Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) Guidelines 21 • Relevant RASs considered in risk review studies • Guidelines developed by AEMO in consultation with industry • Provides reference of good industry practice for development of RASs in the NEM • Summarises RAS related rules obligations for NSPs, AEMO and participants • Includes assessment criteria to evaluate proposed or modified RASs in the NEM See: https://aemo.com.au/en/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/system-operations/remedial-action-scheme-guidelines Full NEM model: future studies 22 • Similar approach to the current risk studies with a few key differences: • Can’t rely on OPDMS snapshots • Dispatch is now based on latest Integrated System Plan (ISP) forecast data rather than historical data • New augmentations and committed generation need to be added in to the model • Interconnectors • Committed generation • Renewable energy zones Simplified model 23 Queensland South Australia New South Wales Victoria Tasmania Simplified model benefits and limitations 24 Benefits: • Reasonably accurate frequency response • Balances the time it takes to prepare models with accuracy, while enabling the assessment of a wider range of future dispatch scenarios and contingencies • Full NEM model can still be used to benchmark the simplified model.
