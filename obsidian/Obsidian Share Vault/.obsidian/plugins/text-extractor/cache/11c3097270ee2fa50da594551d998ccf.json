The complicated branching and intricate scrollwork of the nasal conchae provide large surface area for heat, moisture, and odorant transfer. Of the previous anatomical studies of the canine nasal airway, none have included a detailed rendering of the maxilloturbinate and ethmoidal regions of the nose. Here, we present a high-resolution view of the nasal airway of a large dog, using magnetic resonance imaging scans. Representative airway sections are shown, and a three-dimensional surface model of the airway is reconstructed from the image data. The resulting anatomic structure and detailed morpho- metric data of the airway provide insight into the functional nature of ca- nine olfaction. A complex airway network is revealed, wherein the branched maxilloturbinate and ethmoturbinate scrolls appear structurally distinct. This is quantitatively conﬁrmed by considering the fractal dimension of each airway, which shows that the maxilloturbinate airways are more highly contorted than the ethmoidal airways. Furthermore, sur- face areas of the maxilloturbinate and ethmoidal airways are shown to be much different, despite having analogous physiological functions. Func- tionally, the dorsal meatus of the canine nasal airway is shown to be a bypass for odorant-bearing inspired air around the complicated maxillo- turbinate during snifﬁng for olfaction. Finally, nondimensional analysis is used to show that the airﬂow within both the maxilloturbinate and eth- moturbinate regions must be laminar. This work has direct relevance to biomimetic sniffer design, chemical trace detector development, intra- nasal drug delivery, and inhalation toxicology.

THE ANATOMICAL RECORD 290:1325–1340 (2007) Key words: canine; nasal airway; three-dimensional anatomy; reconstruction; morphometry; magnetic resonance imaging; olfaction; biomimicry; sniffer ANATOMY The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) displays the larg- est variation in body size of all terrestrial vertebrates (Sutter et al., 2007), and its skull comes in more shapes and sizes than any other mammal (Evans, 1993). Gener- ally, the canine skull is classiﬁed according to its shape, which can be long and narrow (dolichocephalic), short and wide (brachycephalic), or of medium proportions (mesaticephalic; Evans, 1993). Representative examples of these types include the Collie, Boston terrier, and Labrador retriever, respectively. The canine nasal cavity is divided by the nasal septum into two bilaterally symmetric airways, each composed of three main anatomical regions: nasal vestibule, respira- tory, and olfactory. The vestibule is the most rostral part of the nasal fossa. Moving caudally, the respiratory region consists of the dorsal and ventral nasal conchae, the later of which ramiﬁes caudally. The ventral nasal concha, or maxilloturbinate, of the dog is of the branch- ing type (Negus, 1958) and is attached to the medial sur- face of the maxilla (Evans, 1993). When viewed from a lateral perspective, this highly three-dimensional struc- ture has an ‘‘accordion-like’’ appearance (see Negus, 1958; Fig. 105). The vestibule and respiratory airways are responsible for warming or cooling, humidifying, and ﬁltering inspired air before its entering the lower respiratory tract. Considering the sparse vasculature within the ves- tibule, little air conditioning is achieved in this region (Negus, 1958); however, ﬁltering may be achieved. Thus, the nasal vestibule is primarily responsible for distribut- ing inspired air within the nasal cavity and for directing the expired air stream. Functionally, it is predominantly the complicated struc- ture of the maxilloturbinate that provides a large surface area for the transfer of heat and moisture. According to Negus (1958), of the four types of maxilloturbinates found in mammals (single-scroll, double-scroll, folded, and branching), the branched maxilloturbinate provides the greatest possible surface area. Furthermore, the tortuous path through the branches of the maxilloturbinate cleans inspired air by particle impaction. Caudal to the respiratory region is the olfactory por- tion of the nose, where the ethmoidal conchae, or ethmo- turbinates, provide a large surface area for odorant transfer. These outgrowths of the cribriform plate are structurally distinct from the branched maxilloturbinate. The ethmoturbinates are bony scrolls, having a ‘‘rolled- up’’ appearance (Evans, 1993). Finally, the frontal sinuses are large recesses located dorsocaudal to the ethmoidal region. Rostrally, a few of the most dorsal ethmoturbinates extend into the sinuses. Otherwise, the sinuses are empty cavities with no outlet. HISTOLOGY Histologically, the tissue lining the nasal cavity con- sists of four main types of epithelium. The relative dis- tribution of each epithelial type is rather similar in most mammals (Reznik, 1990). Moving posteriorly, the nasal vestibule, maxilloturbinate, and ethmoturbinates are primarily covered with squamous, respiratory, and olfac- tory epithelium, respectively (see Mygind et al., 1982, and Anderson et al., 1994, for micrographs of each type). The fourth epithelial type, transitional epithelium, is found in the posterior nasal vestibule and extends into the anterior maxilloturbinate region. In essence, it serves as a region of histological transition from simple squamous nasal lining to the pseudostratiﬁed columnar respiratory type (Mygind et al., 1982). The shift from re- spiratory to olfactory epithelium in the anterior ethmoi- dal region is not well-deﬁned and has been characterized as having an irregular appearance (Morrison and Cos- tanzo, 1992b), where clusters of olfactory cells are found among nonsensory cells. Lastly, the frontal sinuses of the dog are covered with respiratory epithelium, except where ethmoturbinates extend into these cavities (Reznik, 1990). Here, olfactory epithelium is found. Respiratory epithelium has motile cilia projecting from its surface (Mygind et al., 1982). Plentiful vascula- ture, capable of considerable constriction or dilation, is found in the lamina propria beneath the respiratory epi- thelium (Negus, 1958). Furthermore, Negus describes a protuberance, which is most prominent in macrosmatic (keen-scented) species, on the ventral part of the nasal septum in the maxilloturbinate region, formed by vascu- lar spaces beneath the epithelium (Negus, 1958). He exclusively refers to this structure as the ‘‘swell body,’’ while many other authors use the term more liberally for erectile tissue structures of the nasal cavity in gen- eral. Consequently, we adopt the more descriptive term ‘‘septal swell body,’’ which is used to describe a similar structure in the human (e.g., Wexler et al., 2006). Functionally, in macrosmatic species, distention of the septal swell body depends on several environmental con- ditions (Bojsen-Møller and Fahrenkrug, 1971). Depend- ing on the state (extended or collapsed) of the septal swell body, respiratory airﬂow is regulated. When the swell body is extended, ﬂow in much of the ventral mea- tus is blocked, forcing inspiratory ﬂow through the max- illoturbinate airways. Conversely, when the septal swell body is collapsed, inspiratory airﬂow passes freely below the maxilloturbinate to the nasopharynx (Negus, 1958). Such changes in respiratory airway architecture have been observed in the cat (Negus, 1958) and rat (Bojsen- Møller and Fahrenkrug, 1971). Olfactory epithelium, which in the dog is brownish in color (Evans, 1993), has a pseudostratiﬁed columnar or- ganization (Morrison and Costanzo, 1992a) and is remarkably similar in most vertebrate species (Morrison and Costanzo, 1992b). Unlike the case of respiratory epi- thelium, the lamina propria below the olfactory epithe- lium does not contain a rich vascular network. Conse- quently, the thickness of olfactory mucosa does not change appreciably due to vascular constriction or dila- tion (Negus, 1958). 1326 CRAVEN ET AL. 19328494, 2007, 11, Downloaded from https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.20592, Wiley Online Library on [16/08/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Olfactory receptor cells, which are bipolar neurons, are contained within the olfactory epithelium and project dendritic processes to the epithelial surface. The den- drites terminate in expanded vesicles, olfactory knobs, from which many (10–60) sensory cilia extend forming a dense ciliary blanket over the epithelial surface (Morrison and Costanzo, 1992a). Olfactory cilia, which are nonmo- tile (Negus, 1958), are the site of initial sensory transduc- tion, which occurs when neuronal protein receptors em- bedded within the plasma membrane are activated by an odorant (Firestein, 2001; Pernollet et al., 2006). In general, with the exception of the anterior nasal vestibule, airway secretions cover the mucosa of the nasal cavity. The secretions augment heat transfer, humidify inspired air, dehumidify expired air, provide an effective barrier between inhaled noxious chemicals and underlying tissue, absorb odorant molecules, and aid in the removal of inspired particles by means of mucociliary transport. Moreover, without a ﬂuid bath, cilia will die (Proctor, 1982). The thickness of the airway secretion layer has been reported to be in the 5- to 30- mm range (Getchell et al., 1980; Reznik, 1990; Menco and Farbman, 1992). Although often reported as a homo- geneous ‘‘mucus’’ layer, much data support a heterogene- ous layer consisting of at least two phases (Proctor, 1982; Getchell and Getchell, 1992; Menco and Farbman, 1992; Geiser et al., 1997). Furthermore, the layers cover- ing the olfactory and respiratory epithelia differ in chemical composition (Getchell and Getchell, 1992; Debat et al., 2007). For instance, odorant binding pro- teins, which are thought to be responsible for transport- ing and deactivating odorant molecules, have been found in the airway secretions lining the olfactory epithelium, but not in the respiratory region (Briand et al., 2002). AIRWAY MORPHOMETRY AND THREE- DIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION Due to the small size and intricate detail of the canine nasal conchae, in particular the maxilloturbinate and ethmoturbinates, high-resolution imaging is required to resolve the complicated branches and scrollwork therein. The resultant data may be useful for general anatomical reference (as in Schreider and Raabe, 1981; Burk, 1992; Evans, 1993; Anderson et al., 1994; De Rycke et al., 2003), morphometric analysis, and three-dimensional surface reconstruction. Morphometric analysis yields a quantitative look at the geometric structure of the nasal airway. Such data provide detailed morphological information not available from gross dissection. Furthermore, basic functional considera- tions may be addressed by means of dimensional analysis and allometric scaling (see White, 2003, and Schmidt- Nielsen, 1997, respectively). In particular, morphometric data may be incorporated in theoretical models of olfac- tion (e.g., Hahn et al., 1994), inhalation toxicology, respi- ratory physiology, and intranasal drug delivery. Other studies have examined the airway morphometry of various mammalia, including the mouse (Gross et al., 1982), rat (Schreider and Raabe, 1981; Gross et al., 1982; Patra et al., 1987; Kimbell et al., 1997), guinea pig (Schreider, 1983), beagle dog (Schreider and Raabe, 1981), monkey (Schreider and Raabe, 1981; Yeh et al., 1997; Kepler et al., 1998; Harris et al., 2003), and human (Menache et al., 1997; Yeh et al., 1997; Subrama- niam et al., 1998) from serial sections of ﬁxed nasal tis- sue, sections of solid airway casts, or three-dimensional scans (computed tomography, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging, MRI). However, few have used high-resolution imaging, and none have reported detailed regional mor- phometric data. Moreover, only one study (Schreider and Raabe, 1981) considered the morphometry of the canine nasal airway. Reconstruction of anatomical images is currently a rap- idly growing technique that ﬁnds application in ﬁelds such as gross anatomy and computational and experi- mental biology. The ability to view complex anatomic structures three-dimensionally is important in acquiring a visuospatial understanding of gross anatomy (Uhl et al., 2006). Computationally, surface models are re- quired for simulating biological physics such as struc- tural stress–strain analysis (e.g., Richmond et al., 2005; Ryan and van Rietbergen, 2006) and ﬂuid motion. Speciﬁ- cally, computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulations of respiratory physiology (Lindemann et al., 2004), olfaction (Keyhani et al., 1995, 1997), and inhalation toxicology (Kimbell et al., 1993, 1997, 2001; Kepler et al., 1998; Sub- ramaniam et al., 1998; Timchalk et al., 2001; Minard et al., 2006) using reconstructed airway models have been performed. Likewise, detailed experimental models of complex biological structures may be created from reconstructed data using current rapid-prototyping tech- nology (e.g., Hopkins et al., 2000; Stitzel et al., 2003). OBJECTIVES The objective of this work is to quantitatively investi- gate previously indiscernible anatomic detail in the ca- nine nasal airway using a high-ﬁeld animal MRI scan- ner. Earlier imaging attempts at lower resolutions (e.g., Burk, 1992; De Rycke et al., 2003) were insufﬁcient to resolve the complicated branching structure and intri- cate scrollwork of the conchae. Although the maxillotur- binate bones of various carnivores, including a number in the Canidae family, have been resolved using CT (e.g., Van Valkenburgh et al., 2004) of dry skulls, the intact tissue structure has apparently never been fully resolved. Here, we present a detailed view of the canine nasal airway from high-resolution MRI scans that yields a three-dimensional anatomic model of the airway. A detailed morphometric analysis is provided that includes regional measurement and comparison of various ana- tomical structures. The functional implications of the ca- nine nasal airway anatomy and morphometry regarding olfaction are next considered. Lastly, a discussion and comparison of our results with those for the beagle dog of Schreider and Raabe (1981) is given. MATERIALS AND METHODS Specimen A female Labrador retriever mixed-breed canine cadaver, weighing approximately 29.5 kgf (65 lb), was obtained from Sargeant’s Wholesale Biologicals (4900 Lisa Marie Court, Bakersﬁeld, CA 93313). The animal was killed with a standard, intravenously delivered eu- thanasia solution (primary active ingredient: sodium pentobarbital). After death was certain, the animal’s common carotid arteries were cannulated in both the proximal and distal directions and the external jugular 1327CANINE NASAL ANATOMY AND OLFACTORY IMPLICATIONS 19328494, 2007, 11, Downloaded from https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.20592, Wiley Online Library on [16/08/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License vein was transected to allow free ﬂow of blood. No pre- ﬁxative ﬂushing solution was used. After perfusion with ﬁxative (7% formaldehyde, 3.5% glycerin, 3.5% ethylene glycol, 3.5% phenol, and 3.5% methanol), injections of natural rubber latex containing blue dye were made into the cannulated arteries, external jugular veins, a femo- ral vein, and a cephalic vein. A volume of approximately 350 ml of latex was introduced until back pressure was detected from the syringe. The head was removed, and the tissues forming the nasal cavity were dissected from the rest of the head. The facial index (see Evans, 1993) of the specimen was measured to be approximately 110, indicating a mesaticephalic skull type. The nasal cavity specimen consisted of the skeletal muzzle, the most rostral boundary of the braincase, the hard palate, and the nasopharynx. The skeletal muzzle included the incisive, vomer, and maxilla bones and the nasal bones and their attached nasal cartilages. Exter- nal skin, muscle, and other tissues were removed from the external surface of the skeletal muzzle. Mucosa, septa, and conchae of the nasal cavity were undisturbed. The most rostral boundary of the braincase formed the caudal skeletal boundary of the nasal cavity specimen and consisted mainly of the ethmoid bone and its ethmo- turbinates, small pieces of the frontal, lacrimal, and zy- gomatic bones attached to it, and the skeletal muzzle bones. The hard palate consisted of the incisive, maxilla, and palatine bones and their mucosal coverings. Finally, the presphenoid, palatine, pterygoid, and basisphenoid bones, their mucosal coverings, and the attached soft palate comprised the nasopharynx. Compared with the normal physiologic state, shrink- age of soft tissue by ﬁxatives has been reported to be typically less than 10% (Jonmarker et al., 2006). How- ever, given that the soft tissues of present interest (re- spiratory and olfactory epithelia) line a rigid bony cavity, tissue shrinkage is not expected to signiﬁcantly affect the airway dimensions. Indeed, Menache et al. (1997) were unable to measure size or shape changes in nasal tissue due to ﬁxation. They concluded that ‘‘size changes reported for soft tissues may not be as extensive in the nasal cavity because more rigid tissues such as the bone surround the nasal cavity.’’ Furthermore, in our speci- men, the presence of latex-ﬁlled blood vessels (down to larger arterioles and venules) probably offsets tissue vol- ume lost to ﬁxative-induced shrinkage. However, this was not conﬁrmed by measurements comparing fresh, unﬁxed specimens and ﬁxed, uninjected specimens with the ﬁxed, injected specimen used in this study. MRI Compared with early histological sectioning techni- ques (e.g., Kimbell et al., 1993, 1997, 2001), modern imaging modalities provide a more complete anatomic description in a digital format desirable for computa- tional analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction (Timchalk et al., 2001; Minard et al., 2006). Further- more, because of the present need for high-resolution data of not only the bony structures in the nasal cavity but also the soft tissue, MRI is the preferred modality. As noted by De Rycke et al. (2003), who compared CT and MRI scans of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses in normal mesaticephalic dogs, MRI is superior to CT at resolving soft-tissue structures. A large-breed canine specimen was chosen for the size of its nasal cavity, compared with that of smaller breeds (e.g., English beagle). Imaging the airway structure of the larger breed leads to higher inherent spatial resolu- tion for a given acquisition time. Speciﬁcally, for a given ﬁeld-of-view and slice thickness, each of the physical structures in the nasal cavity of a large specimen is rep- resented by a greater number of volume elements (voxels), compared with the case of a smaller specimen. Alternatively, imaging a smaller specimen using a smaller ﬁeld-of-view results in a data matrix of voxels each containing fewer protons per voxel. Consequently, a longer acquisition time is required to recover the same signal-to-noise ratio obtained in the previous case. For scanning, the cadaver specimen was placed in a plastic cylinder (17-cm length, 9.5-cm inner diameter) with an inlet and outlet pipe. Glass beads (6.0 to 10.0 mm diameter) were placed in the cylinder, surrounding the sample, and degassed water was added to ﬁll the cylin- der. Trapped air was removed from the specimen by applying partial vacuum to the cylinder inlet, because small air bubbles not only result in signal voids, but also in distortion of the MRI scans due to magnetic suscepti- bility effects. The glass beads were required for mechan- ical stability of the specimen during scanning, because the rapid switching of the magnetic ﬁeld gradients can otherwise cause vibration. Additionally, the glass beads were used to limit the total volume of water surrounding the specimen, which otherwise could lead to complica- tions with the MR receiver dynamic range and inhomo- geneities in the RF ﬁeld within the specimen. All scans were performed using a Varian 7-Tesla mag- net operated by a VNMRS console. The gradients (Magnex, SGRAD 305/210/HD/S) had an inner diameter of 21 cm, with maximum gradient strength of 200 mT/ m, and a linear region (6 6%) of 12.0 cm. The RF coil was a quadrature birdcage design with an inner diame- ter of 14.0 cm. Because the length of the present speci- men (approximately 14 cm) was longer than the linear region of the magnetic ﬁeld gradients and the homoge- neous region of the detector coil, sets of composite scans were acquired with the sample placed in three different overlapping axial positions. The slice thickness obtained here was 200 mm, with an in-plane spatial resolution of 180 3 180 mm (75.6 3 75.6 mm ﬁeld-of-view, 420 3 420 data matrix). The ﬁrst and the third data sets (of the rostral and caudal regions of the nose, respectively) con- tained 250 slices each, whereas the second data set (of the intermediate region) consisted of 450 slices. Data ac- quisition for each section was performed in ﬁve (data sets 1 and 3) or nine (data set 2) interleaved subsets of 50 slices each (the gap between slices of a subset was 800 mm) to avoid saturation effects due to imperfect slice excitation proﬁles. The minimum value of the repetition time of the spin echo sequence was limited by the duty cycle of the gradients and was set to 6 sec for the smaller and 10 sec for the larger data sets. All scans had the same echo time of 12.5 msec. The data acquisi- tion time for the entire data set was 75 hr. Surface Reconstruction The process of converting the raw MRI slices to a three-dimensional surface model is illustrated in Figure 1. First, image processing of the raw MRI data was 1328 CRAVEN ET AL. 19328494, 2007, 11, Downloaded from https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.20592, Wiley Online Library on [16/08/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License required to obtain optimal image quality for image seg- mentation. Image segmentation, or partitioning an image into its elemental regions or components, of com- plicated images such as airways is an extremely difﬁcult task (Gonzalez and Woods, 2002). Here, we wish to seg- ment a high-contrast image having a sharp distinction between airway and tissue. Hence, the raw MRI slices were masked and ﬁltered, and then the airway/tissue contrast was maximized based on a histogram analysis of gray level intensities. The region-of-interest was ﬁrst restricted to only the nasal airway by applying a mask to the raw images. Next, a 3 3 3 median ﬁlter was applied. The nonlinear nature of this ﬁlter permits effective removal of noise while preserving edges in an image, making it ideal for ﬁltering airway data. The image contrast was then enhanced by applying a linear contrast stretch to each slice. Although much improved, remaining random noise in some of the images prevented optimal image contrast and, more importantly, uniform contrast between consec- utive images. Thus, based on a histogram analysis of the gray level intensities in various slices, a ‘‘controlled’’ sat- uration was used, where a small fraction of the brightest pixels in each slice were saturated, yielding a uniform, high-contrast data set. Figure 2 shows a comparison of a raw and processed MRI slice. Next, because the data were acquired as three par- tially overlapping sets, image registration (i.e., data set alignment) was required. This consisted of digitally rotating and translating data sets 1 and 3, relative to data set 2, by an optimal angle and number of pixels, respectively. Optimal values were obtained by maximiz- ing the correlation coefﬁcient between the overlapping images of data sets 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 (see Gonzalez and Woods, 2002). This resulted in complete alignment of all three data sets. Image segmentation consisted of partitioning only the nasal airways of the left nasal cavity, assuming bilateral symmetry. Due to preliminary image processing, seg- mentation of large airways was trivial and was mostly accomplished by means of algorithmic schemes that included region growing, thresholding, contour extrac- tion by means of edge detection, and contour interpola- tion and extrapolation in the axial direction. However, for small airways near the resolution threshold, which have only ﬁve to six voxels across their width, the air/ tissue interface becomes less distinct. In these regions, segmentation was highly interactive, ranging from man- ual correction of errors incurred by the algorithmic schemes to fully manual segmentation. The uncertainty in manual segmentation of the smallest airways in the conchae is estimated to be 6 one to two voxels. Finally, a three-dimensional surface model was gener- ated from the segmentation results by means of a modi- ﬁed form of the Marching Cubes algorithm (Lorensen and Cline, 1987). The surface is represented as a trian- gulated mesh, where each triangle is deﬁned by a nor- mal, outward-facing vector and three vertices. Slight subsequent surface smoothing was then performed to reduce ‘‘staircasing.’’ In general, several surface smoothing algorithms exist, some of which can signiﬁcantly corrupt the three- dimensional model (for instance, by not preserving the internal volume). The particular algorithm used here smooths a triangulated surface by shifting its vertices (Mercury Computer Systems, 2006). The quality of the smoothed surface is controlled by two parameters: a smoothing ‘‘factor’’ (i.e., a coefﬁcient that restricts the degree of vertex shift) and the number of smoothing iter- ations. In smoothing the reconstructed surface of the ca- nine nasal airway, these parameters were chosen such that the internal volume of the original model was pre- served. A comparison between the original and smoothed models shows a 0.05% difference in internal volume. Airway Morphometry Morphometric analysis of the canine nasal airway was performed using a custom image processing program developed and thoroughly validated in-house. Airway pe- rimeter (P) and cross-sectional area (Ac) were obtained directly from the segmented slices. The total airway pe- rimeter in each two-dimensional slice was determined by ﬁrst extracting the airway boundary (see Gonzalez and Woods, 2002). Given the in-plane spatial resolution of the data, the perimeter was then calculated by consid- ering the connectivity of the resultant boundary pixels. The cross-sectional area, on the other hand, was calcu- lated as the product of the total number of segmented airway pixels and the square of the in-plane spatial resolution.

The hydraulic diameter applies to any pipe or duct, including airways, and is commonly used in ﬂuid dy- namics to characterize ﬂow in noncircular channels (White, 2003). Physically, the hydraulic diameter repre- sents the characteristic airway diameter/width. Dh ¼ 4Ac P ð1Þ Calculating the surface area of a complicated three- dimensional boundary can be challenging. Although the total surface area of the nasal airway is easily obtained from the triangulated surface model by summing the areas of the constituent triangles, ﬁnding the regional distribution of surface area in the axial direction is more difﬁcult. A good approximation of the cumulative surface area is found using Equation 2. Conceptually, the cumu- lative surface area is found by sweeping the airway pe- rimeter along the arc length prescribed by the surface from the naris (z 5 0) to any axial location z. The square root term represents the average arc length prescribed by each point on the surface. Here, Equation 2 was eval- uated numerically using the trapezoidal rule and a ﬁ- nite-difference approximation of the derivative term (e.g., Chapra and Canale, 2002, for more on these nu- merical techniques). Note that Equation 2 is not simply the product of the airway perimeter and the slice thick- ness, which is often used but is only a crude approxima- tion that is erroneous for a highly contorted surface.

The error associated with operator uncertainty in segmentation of the smallest airways is estimated to be \u00015% for cross- sectional area, hydraulic diameter, cumulative surface area, cumulative internal volume, and fractal dimension, whereas the airway perimeter is rather insensitive to operator uncertainty (0.3% error). Lastly, an extensive validation of our custom image processing program was conducted by comparing the morphometric statistics of various three-dimensional surfaces (cube, sphere, cylinder, and cone) to known geo- metric formulas. Comparison of the output with theory resulted in negligible error for all morphometric data. Functional Implications The functional implications of the anatomy and mor- phology of the canine nasal airway regarding olfaction make use of the dimensionless Reynolds (Re) and Womersley (Wo) numbers, Equations 5 and 6, respec- tively. Here, Vave is the cross-sectional average velocity, m is the kinematic viscosity of air, and f is the sniff fre- quency in units of Hertz (sniffs per second). For canine snifﬁng, the peak Vave at the naris on inspiration has been measured to be roughly 5 m/sec, while f was shown to be approximately 5 Hz (Craven, 2008). ReDh ¼ VaveDh t ð5Þ WoDh ¼ Dh 2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2pf t r ð6Þ Physically, the Reynolds number is the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in the nasal airﬂow. For steady or quasi-steady ﬂow, low Reynolds numbers (ReDh < 2000) generally indicate laminar ﬂow, while high-Reynolds- number ﬂow is typically turbulent. Similarly, the magnitude of the Womersley number is an indicator of the degree of unsteadiness in the ﬂow (Loudon and Tordesillas, 1998). In general, when Wo < 1, the ﬂow may be approximated as quasi-steady, mean- ing the time-dependent solution is simply a superposition of steady-state solutions. However, as the Womersley number grows larger than unity, the ﬂow increasingly deviates from quasi-steady behavior, tending toward fully transient ﬂow. RESULTS From the MRI scans, the present cadaver specimen represents a credible example of a large mesaticephalic canine nasal cavity per comparison with Schreider and Raabe (1981), Burk (1992), Evans (1993), Anderson et al. (1994), and De Rycke et al. (2003). The following results represent the most detailed anatomic data and measurements yet made of a canine nasal specimen. As reported by Dodd and Squirrel (1980; cited in Thorne, 1995), a range of anatomic measurements is found in various dog breeds. In mammals, the nasal air- way dimensions depend on the size and age of the ani- mal (Schreider and Raabe, 1981; Gross et al., 1982; Patra et al., 1987). Furthermore, due to the nasal cycle (see Bojsen-Møller and Fahrenkrug, 1971; Webber et al., 1987), in vivo airway measurements will vary for the same subject, depending on the degree of nasal turbi- nate engorgement (Guilmette et al., 1989). Nonetheless, given slight intraspecies variability, the morphometric characteristics (e.g., the regional distribution of surface area) of the nasal airway of other macrosmatic animals have been shown to be remarkably uniform (Gross et al., 1982; Patra et al., 1987). Studying a range of canine specimens at this level of detail is not presently practical and is well beyond our 1330 CRAVEN ET AL. 19328494, 2007, 11, Downloaded from https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.20592, Wiley Online Library on [16/08/2024].

Instead, a detailed comparison of various ana- tomic regions within a typical mesaticephalic canine nasal cavity is given. Following the results presented here, a discussion and comparison with limited data from the mesaticephalic beagle is given in the subse- quent section. Nasal Airway Anatomy The product of the segmentation consists of a binary data set where 1’s represent airway and 0’s tissue/exte- rior. Consequently, the left airway structure is clearly distinguished from surrounding tissue. Figure 3 illus- trates 20 transverse cross-sections of the segmented air- way at various axial locations out of 668 total slices. Ap- proximate locations of each of the anatomic regions (nasal vestibule, maxilloturbinate, nasomaxillary, eth- moidal, and frontal sinus) are indicated. Here, the nasomaxillary region refers to the axial por- tion of the nasal cavity between the maxilloturbinate and ethmoidal regions, where the nasomaxillary opening is located ventrally. The maxilloturbinate and ethmotur- binates, which are outgrowths of the maxilla and cribri- form plate, respectively, terminate within this region. Functionally, this portion of the nasal cavity serves as a region of morphologic transition from the maxilloturbi- nate region to the ethmoidal region. This is further dem- onstrated in Figure 4, which shows a sagittal section of the airway obtained by ensemble averaging multiple sagittal plane slices. This technique, which has potential for broad application in other ﬁelds (e.g., Mery et al., 1994), yields an anatomic section, similar to an anatomic drawing (e.g., Evans, 1993), that represents the most prominent airway structures. During snifﬁng for olfaction, the nostrils of the dog dilate, changing the conformation of the nasal vestibule (Evans, 1993). From high-speed videography of canine snifﬁng, dilation of the nostrils during inspiration opens a direct pathway above the alar fold to the dorsal mea- tus (Settles et al., 2003; Settles, 2005). From Figure 4, once air enters the dorsal meatus a direct ﬂow path to the ethmoidal region (i.e., the olfactory region) is seen to exist. Thus, the dorsal meatus functions as a bypass for odorant-bearing inspired air, around the tortuous maxil- loturbinate to the ethmoidal region, during snifﬁng. Surface Reconstruction The three-dimensional surface reconstruction, des- cribed earlier, resulted in a triangulated surface model containing nearly 10 million total elements. For reference, Figure 5 illustrates the orientation of the three-dimen- sional model, relative to the external cranial anatomy. Figure 6 shows several three-dimensional views of the airway model following slight surface smoothing. In the lateral view of Figure 6b, the dorsal meatus appears as a long duct between the nasal vestibule and the ethmoidal region, further supporting the aforemen- tioned bypass hypothesis. In Figure 6b–d, the ethmotur- binates appear as ‘‘ﬁnger-like’’ structures, most of which extend rostrally from the cribriform plate (not included in the airway model), while a few of the dorsal-most ethmoturbinates appear to become conﬂuent with the frontal sinus caudally. Airway Morphometry Morphometric analysis of the canine nasal airway was conducted by examining distributions of perimeter, cross-sectional area, hydraulic diameter, and surface area. Additionally, the fractal dimensions of the maxillo- turbinate and ethmoidal airways are considered. Figure 7 Fig. 3.

The locations of the various ana- tomic regions are shown for reference. The perimeter and cross-sectional area of the airways within the nasal vestibule are relatively small. Caudally, there is a sharp rise in perimeter in the maxilloturbi- nate region, a reduction to a local minimum in the naso- maxillary region, and a subsequent increase to the larg- est airway perimeter, which occurs in the ethmoidal region. The cross-sectional area increases through the maxilloturbinate and nasomaxillary regions, reaching a maximum in the ethmoidal portion of the airway. As illustrated in Figure 8, the hydraulic diameter is relatively constant through the nasal vestibule, having a value of 2–3 mm. A minimum hydraulic diameter of roughly 1 mm occurs in the maxilloturbinate airways, while a slightly larger Dh of nearly 1.5 mm appears in the ethmoidal airways. These values are interpreted as characteristic diameter/width scales for the smallest air passages of the canine nasal airway. Figure 9 shows the distribution of cumulative surface area through the nasal cavity. The total surface area of the left nasal airway is 411 cm2. Surface areas associated with the nasal vestibule, nasomaxillary region, and fron- tal sinus are small compared with that of the maxillotur- binate and ethmoidal airways, roughly 120 cm2 and 210 cm 2, respectively.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License of the nasal conchae dramatically increase the surface area. Physically, this facilitates heat and mass transfer in the nasal cavity. That is, the large surface area of the maxilloturbinates warms and humidiﬁes inspired air, while the even-larger surface area of the ethmoturbi- nates collects odorant molecules efﬁciently. The total surface area contained within the ethmoidal region is nearly twice that of the maxilloturbinate region. Although heat and mass transfer occur by analo- gous physical mechanisms (Incropera and DeWitt, 2002), a substantially larger portion of the total nasal internal surface area is devoted to olfactory mass transfer than to heat transfer. Two functional explanations for the disparity in re- gional surface area apply here. First, the epithelium cov- ering the ethmoturbinates has regional selectivity (Buck, 2004). That is, not all odorant receptors are expressed in all parts of the olfactory epithelium; there is a certain areal distribution for each receptor type. This is not true for the respiratory epithelium, which covers the maxilloturbinates and does not serve in odor- ant discrimination. Consequently, the surface area of the Fig. 8. Distribution of hydraulic diameter, Dh, with axial coordinate in the canine nasal airway. Fig. 9. Distribution of cumulative surface area, As, with axial coordinate in the canine nasal airway. 1334 CRAVEN ET AL. 19328494, 2007, 11, Downloaded from https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.20592, Wiley Online Library on [16/08/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License ethmoidal region represents what is required for selec- tive olfactory mass transfer, while the nonselective transfer of heat and moisture in the maxilloturbinates requires less surface area. Second, the difference may be related to the geometric location of each region. Whereas the maxilloturbinate region is located along the main ﬂow path between the naris and nasopharyngeal meatus, the ethmoidal region is recessed. Consequently, lower velocities and corre- sponding transfer rates occur in the ethmoidal airways, requiring more surface area in this region than the max- illoturbinate region, where transfer rates may be higher. Detailed experimental measurements and computational simulations are, however, required to further explore this hypothesis. The cumulative internal volume of the left nasal cav- ity was calculated. The largest volumes occur in the eth- moidal and frontal sinus regions, 10.9 cm3 and 5.9 cm3, respectively. The total internal volume of the nasal cav- ity is 24.4 cm3. Lastly, the geometric complexity of the maxilloturbi- nate and ethmoidal airway structures, in terms of the fractal dimension of the perimeter, is examined. Figure 10 is a plot of the area–perimeter relation (Equation 4) well within each region. The mean fractal dimension (calculated from the slope of the log Ac 2 log P curve) of the maxilloturbinate airways is 1.73 (R2 5 0.98), while D of the ethmoidal airways is 1.11 (R2 5 0.93). Thus, the boundary of the maxilloturbinate airways is more complex than the boundary of the ethmoidal airways. This quantitatively conﬁrms the observation of Schreider and Raabe (1981) that the maxillo- turbinates of the dog appear more complex than the ethmoturbinates. This structural difference is a result of the develop- mental nature of the nasal conchae and how each struc- ture ramiﬁes within the nasal cavity. Functionally, the structural difference may occur in part from the need for plentiful vasculature in the maxilloturbinates (but not in the ethmoturbinates) to drive heat transfer. None- theless, the ‘‘accordion-like’’ branched maxilloturbinate and the ‘‘rolled-up’’ ethmoturbinates are both qualita- tively and quantitatively distinct structures. Further study of the functional signiﬁcance of differences in geo- metric complexity of these turbinate structures would be interesting. Fig. 10.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Functional Implications Assuming incompressible airﬂow, conservation of mass was used to estimate the peak Reynolds number of the ﬂow on inspiration (Equation 5) between the naris and nasopharynx. Figure 11 shows the results. Reynolds numbers well into the ethmoidal and frontal sinus regions are not shown because the velocity distri- bution in this recessed region is not presently known. Nonetheless, during snifﬁng, the majority of the canine nasal cavity is seen to contain low-Reynolds-number ﬂow, with the minimum Reynolds number being of order 100. The distribution of the Womersley number in the nasal cavity during snifﬁng is plotted in Figure 12. For a sniff frequency of 5 Hz, the smallest airways within the maxilloturbinate and ethmoidal regions are charac- terized by Wo \u0001 1, whereas Wo for the rest of the nasal cavity exceeds unity. Thus, the overall airﬂow in the ca- nine nasal airway during snifﬁng is shown to be fully unsteady. Consequently, as opposed to the case of Fig. 12. Distribution of Womersley number in the canine nasal airway during snifﬁng (sniff frequency 5 5 Hz). Fig. 13.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License human olfaction (Keyhani et al., 1995, 1997), a quasi- steady approximation is not valid for canine olfactory airﬂow. Finally, the nature of the ﬂow (whether laminar or turbulent) during snifﬁng is considered by plotting the ratio Remax/Wo. In general, for purely oscillatory pipe ﬂow, transition to turbulence occurs in the range Remax/ Wo \u0001 250–1,000 (Peacock et al., 1998), although airway branching can reduce the stability of the ﬂow (Peacock et al., 1997). By this criterion, from Figure 13, most of the airﬂow within and downstream of the maxilloturbi- nate region is expected to be laminar. DISCUSSION These results from a single canine cadaver are believed to represent the morphometry and functional implications of mesaticephalic canines in general. To demonstrate this, our results are compared in Figure 14 to those of the mesaticephalic beagle dog (weight 5 10 kgf) of Schreider and Raabe (1981). In constructing Figure 14a,b, the abscissae have been normalized by the axial location of the choana, that is, the opening of the nasopharyngeal meatus into the nasopharynx, which was easily identiﬁed in each data set.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License The data of Schreider and Raabe (1981) were obtained from tracings of a nasal cast at approximately every 5 mm in axial location. The airway cast was evidently not complete in certain regions and did not include the entire frontal sinus region. Nonetheless, the morphomet- ric characteristics of the two data sets compare well overall. Apart from differences in magnitude related to body size, the most obvious discrepancy occurs in the ethmoidal region. Schreider and Raabe (1981) reported difﬁculty in distinguishing between parts of the frontal sinuses, which were not cast, and the ethmoturbinates. In general, this structural similarity agrees with the other results of Schreider and Raabe (1981), who consid- ered intraspecies nasal airway structure by means of a comparison with Granito (1971), Schreider (1977), and Schreider and Hutchens (1980). They concluded that, de- spite differences based on size, the airway architecture was nearly identical for individuals of the same species. Other quantitative studies have reported similar intra- species morphometric results for the mouse and rat (Gross et al., 1982; Patra et al., 1987). CONCLUSIONS A detailed view of the nasal airway of a large dog is given, based on high-resolution MRI scans. Representa- tive airway sections are shown and a three-dimensional surface model of the left airway is reconstructed from the image data. The resulting anatomic structure, com- bined with detailed morphometric data, provides insight into the functional nature of canine olfaction. Two-dimensional sections and the full three-dimen- sional model reveal a complex airway network, espe- cially within the maxilloturbinate and ethmoidal regions of the nasal cavity. Qualitatively, the conchae in these regions appear structurally distinct. This was conﬁrmed by ﬁnding the fractal dimension of the maxilloturbinate and ethmoidal airways, the former being quantitatively more highly contorted than the latter. Further study of the functional implications of airway boundary contor- tion on heat and mass transfer is recommended. Anatomically, the dorsal meatus of the canine is shown to function as a bypass for odorant-bearing inspired air around the complicated maxilloturbinate during snifﬁng for olfaction. Thus, a majority of the sniff airﬂow is believed to reach the ethmoidal region (where olfactory reception occurs) directly by means of the dor- sal meatus, rather than by ﬁrst ﬁltering through the maxilloturbinate as was previously thought (e.g., Shep- herd, 2004). The cumulative surface area of each nasal region was calculated, revealing that the total surface area required for olfactory mass transfer in the ethmoidal region is nearly twice that required for the transfer of heat and moisture in the maxilloturbinate region. The difference may also be related to the anatomic location of the re- spective regions; however, a fundamental experimental and computational investigation is required to further explore this claim. Lastly, the nature of olfactory airﬂow within the ca- nine nasal airway was investigated by considering the distribution of the nondimensional Reynolds and Womersley numbers. This reveals that the overall air- ﬂow within the canine airway during snifﬁng is fully unsteady; a quasi-steady approximation is thus not justi- ﬁed. Furthermore, most of the airﬂow within and down- stream of the maxilloturbinate region is expected to be laminar, including all airﬂow associated with olfaction. In summary, we have provided a detailed analysis of the anatomy and morphology of the canine nasal airway and have explored the functional implications of these data regarding olfaction. These results and our computa- tional approach are relevant to biomimetic sniffer design, chemical trace detector development, intranasal drug delivery, inhalation toxicology, and surgical recon- struction.
