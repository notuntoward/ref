The 15th International Symposium on District Heating and Cooling Assessing the feasibility of using the heat demand-outdoor temperature function for a long-term district heat demand forecast I.

Rovisco Pais 1, 1049-001 Lisbon, Portugal bVeolia Recherche & Innovation, 291 Avenue Dreyfous Daniel, 78520 Limay, France cDépartement Systèmes Énergétiques et Environnement - IMT Atlantique, 4 rue Alfred Kastler, 44300 Nantes, France Abstract District heating networks are commonly addressed in the literature as one of the most effective solutions for decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector. These systems require high investments which are returned through the heat sales. Due to the changed climate conditions and building renovation policies, heat demand in the future could decrease, prolonging the investment return period. The main scope of this paper is to assess the feasibility of using the heat demand – outdoor temperature function for heat demand forecast. The district of Alvalade, located in Lisbon (Portugal), was used as a case study. The district is consisted of 665 buildings that vary in both construction period and typology. Three weather scenarios (low, medium, high) and three district renovation scenarios were developed (shallow, intermediate, deep). To estimate the error, obtained heat demand values were compared with results from a dynamic heat demand model, previously developed and validated by the authors. The results showed that when only weather change is considered, the margin of error could be acceptable for some applications (the error in annual demand was lower than 20% for all weather scenarios considered). However, after introducing renovation scenarios, the error value increased up to 59.5% (depending on the weather and renovation scenarios combination considered). The value of slope coefficient increased on average within the range of 3.8% up to 8% per decade, that corresponds to the decrease in the number of heating hours of 22-139h during the heating season (depending on the combination of weather and renovation scenarios considered). On the other hand, function intercept increased for 7.8-12.7% per decade (depending on the coupled scenarios). The values suggested could be used to modify the function parameters for the scenarios considered, and improve the accuracy of heat demand estimations. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

(1) Many design and modelling studies of domestic solar PV and battery systems take SSR maximization as one of the objectives [2-4]. Most take it as given that SSR maximization is a good thing. However, Bertsch et al. have published a critique showing the positive correlation between SSR and internal rate of return (IRR, a measure of financial benefit) exists only up to SSR = 65 % in Ireland and 76 % in Germany [5]. Further increases in SSR can be achieved by larger battery size, but at greater cost than can be recouped by saving on electricity bills during the battery’s lifetime. Simshauser and Nelson have speculated on an adverse consequence of many households trying to maximize SSR, which they term the ‘energy market death spiral’ [6]. Households increasing their SSR may reduce the income of electricity retailers, who increase their tariffs in response, leading to more households (if they can afford it) increasing their SSR to reduce their exposure to ever higher electricity prices. The pursuit of SSR is not a straightforward good. Little has been published on the relationship between SSR and environmental benefit. Zhang et al. use SSR as a proxy for environmental benefit in their modelling of a block of flats with PV and battery [7]. They cite Luthander et al.’s paper as justification, though no link between SSR and environmental benefit is claimed therein [1]. Of the 268 residents of Queensland, Australia, that Agnew and Dargusch surveyed on their attitudes towards home batteries, 80 % wished to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions [8]. Although reduction of electricity bills was the most common reason for considering buying home batteries, a link between energy self-sufficiency and environmental benefit has clearly become embedded in many minds. This link must be examined in order that research into the design of domestic PV-battery systems may better serve the environmentally-conscious section of the public.

Results are presented in Section 3, followed by conclusions and further work in Section 4. 2. Method Industry specialists were consulted for this work, to identify potential environmental benefits of home batteries. The claims were examined by developing a Matlab model of a domestic PV-battery system operating an SSR- maximizing ‘greedy’ algorithm, as used by Weniger et al. [3] and Truong et al. [4]. The battery capacity was varied and its effects on SSR, net present value (NPV), and CO2 emissions over the 15-year battery lifespan were examined. One year’s rooftop PV generation and six household demand time series in the UK were measured for this work at 2-s and 5-minute resolution respectively. The PV time series was averaged to 5-minute resolution before use. The annual loads range from 2563-8015 kWh. This spans the UK average of 3800 kWh, providing a good range for study. Behavior often changes after installing a home battery [8], but the effect on electrical usage is not modelled here. A so-called ‘greedy algorithm’ is mathematically guaranteed to maximize SSR [4]. It serves demand first by PV electricity, then by discharging the battery if this is insufficient. If the discharge power limit is reached or the battery runs empty, power is imported from the grid. If there is more PV electricity generated than needed, the excess is used to charge the battery up to the power limit or until it is full, then any remaining excess is exported to the grid. SSR is calculated as in equation (1).

More details of the model inputs, algorithm and parameter values are given in Appendix A. 3. Results Consultation with industry specialists identified the following potential environmental benefits of home batteries. These are examined in turn using the model and data described in Section 2. • Usage of more low-CO2 electricity, • Reduction of transmission and distribution losses by consuming more of the electricity generated onsite, • Reduction of peak import/export and associated losses and inefficiencies, • Relief of voltage violations on the distribution network, allowing more PV to connect. ‘CO2 arbitrage’ (shifting import/export between periods of low/high grid CO2 intensity), is left to future work. 3.1. Usage of more low-CO2 electricity Fig. 1 shows for House 1 (annual electricity consumption 8015 kWh) that SSR is increased by installing larger PV and battery. NPV relative to the case with no PV and no battery is maximized around 11 kW PV and 10.5 kWh battery. CO2 saved relative to no PV and no battery increases with PV capacity but decreases with battery capacity. Kabakian et al.’s finding that installing a battery saves less CO2 than having PV only [9] is confirmed for all six houses, due simply to the battery’s charge/discharge losses and embodied emissions of manufacture. However, Uddin et al.’s conclusion that home batteries are thus bad for the environment [10] is too simplistic, as shown in the next sections. Fig. 1. (a) SSR (%); (b) NPV (k£); (c) CO2 saved (ton) relative to the case with no PV, no battery, for House 1, vs. PV and battery size. 3.2. Reduction of transmission and distribution losses The average electrical loss in the UK transmission and distribution networks is 8-9 % [11]. Transmitting PV electricity that goes unused in one house, to one nearby, typically incurs negligible losses. In that case, each kWh exported is credited equally to the burden of each kWh imported. However, if a house is very remote, finite losses in exporting excess PV electricity can reduce the environmental benefit compared to onsite consumption. To explore this effect, a loss of 1 = 8 % is modelled up to a conceptual branch point, and a further 2 to the house (Fig. 2). If every kWh of electricity generation causes cg0 kg/kWh of CO2 to be emitted, every kWh imported emits 𝑐𝑐𝑔𝑔− = 𝑐𝑐𝑔𝑔0 (1−[𝜆𝜆1+𝜆𝜆2]) kg/kWh (2) when taking account of transmission and distribution losses, while every kWh exported saves 𝑐𝑐𝑔𝑔+ = 𝑐𝑐𝑔𝑔0(1−2𝜆𝜆2) (1−[𝜆𝜆1+𝜆𝜆2]) kg/kWh. (3) 4 Author name / Energy Procedia 00 (2018) 000–000 Fig. 2. Abstraction showing transmission and distribution loss of 1 +2 to each house, and 22 in exporting from one house to another. In reality, there is generally not one conceptual branch point and conceptual neighbour: excess PV energy could be transmitted to many neighbours. Local loss 2 would vary across the network and throughout the day, with varying network loading. Although the physical characteristics corresponding to specific values of 2 have not yet been determined, Fig. 3 (a) and (b) show that for 2 ≥ 15% and across the range of households, a non-zero battery can save CO2 relative to PV only. This is in contrast to the previous section, when 2 = 0. The extremely unlikely bounding case of 2 = 50 % is included for logical completeness. Varying 2 has no effect on SSR nor NPV (Fig. 3 (c), (d)), because 2 only affects the CO2 accounting but neither the other two calculations. Fig. 3. CO2 savings of (a) House 1, and; (b) House 6, for varying 2 and battery sizes; (c) SSR, and; (d) NPV, showing no change with 2. 3.3. Reduction of peak import/export By reducing peak flows, ohmic losses in power cables are reduced. Furthermore, reduced import peaks mean less need to upgrade electricity network infrastructure such as transformers and new peaker generation plants. While increasing battery size does reduce peak import across the year (Appendix B, Fig. 4), there is no effect at all on peak export when using the SSR-maximizing greedy algorithm. Solar irradiation at UK latitudes has such wide annual variation that under this algorithm, the battery is empty nearly all the time in winter, and often full before noon in summer, when excess PV generation is highest (Appendix B, Fig. 5). Unsurprisingly the greedy algorithm is not used when import/export minimization is the goal. Instead, linear programming methods are favoured [12]. With judicious algorithm design, the SSR need not be greatly reduced from the theoretically possible maximum obtained using the greedy algorithm. 3.4. Relief of voltage violations The increasing penetration of rooftop PV increases the risk of voltage violations on the distribution network. Crossland et al. have modelled this phenomenon in real networks [13]. They recommend placing home batteries in targeted locations to relieve voltage problems, and thus allow more PV to connect and contribute towards decarbonizing the electricity system. Their work relies on the assumption that the batteries are designed to charge during high-risk periods, that is, summer noon-time when domestic demand is low and PV generation high. But as shown in Section 3.3, the greedy algorithm does not achieve this. S.I.

Conclusions and further work When exporting electricity to one’s neighbors is nearly loss-less, as in most residential areas in the UK, CO2 savings decrease with battery size. In this case, SSR is negatively correlated with environmental benefit. However, when a network is lossy, or PV penetration is high and forces exported energy further away, installing a battery can indeed save CO2 emissions. This is not reflected in SSR, which has no dependence on local network losses. Finding the level of loss or PV penetration each value of 2 corresponds to is left to further work. Benefits associated with reducing grid import/export and relieving voltage constraints are better achieved through algorithms designed for these aims. They need not sacrifice SSR greatly, but must be designed intelligently. This may also be true of ‘CO2 arbitrage’, whereby electricity is imported from the grid at times of low CO2 intensity and exported when CO2 intensity is high. Grid CO2 intensity has been assumed constant throughout this work, at the level of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT).

Conclusions and further work When exporting electricity to one’s neighbors is nearly loss-less, as in most residential areas in the UK, CO2 savings decrease with battery size. In this case, SSR is negatively correlated with environmental benefit. However, when a network is lossy, or PV penetration is high and forces exported energy further away, installing a battery can indeed save CO2 emissions. This is not reflected in SSR, which has no dependence on local network losses. Finding the level of loss or PV penetration each value of 2 corresponds to is left to further work. Benefits associated with reducing grid import/export and relieving voltage constraints are better achieved through algorithms designed for these aims. They need not sacrifice SSR greatly, but must be designed intelligently. This may also be true of ‘CO2 arbitrage’, whereby electricity is imported from the grid at times of low CO2 intensity and exported when CO2 intensity is high. Grid CO2 intensity has been assumed constant throughout this work, at the level of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT). In future, the marginal generator may at times be wind, PV or nuclear, rather than always CCGT. The authors are constructing hourly grid CO2 time series under different generation mix scenarios, to test the impact of CO2 arbitrage. Some financial benefit is possible by installing home batteries, as seen for Houses 1 and 2 in Fig. 3 (d). An argument can be made for using the concept of self-sufficiency as a marketing tool, to connect more PV to the grid than otherwise. For researchers however, it should be clear that SSR alone is not an appropriate metric for environmental benefit. The system must be modelled in all its complexity, instead of relying on the apparent objectivity of SSR. Indeed, this work too can be criticized for neglecting human toxicity, resource depletion, ecological damage, and other sustainability indicators. Not only SSR, but CO2 as well may be an insufficient metric for environmental benefit.

Capital expenditure (CAPEX) includes fixed and variable costs for PV and battery, including installation and power electronics.

SPEND is yearly expenditure on electricity, buy price cbuy increasing at rate rinfl. Operations and maintenance are assumed covered by the suppliers. The NPV for the same house with no PV and no battery is then subtracted from (4), as a baseline reference. The lifetime CO2 emissions are calculated analogously to (4). Instead of –CAPEX there is embodied CO2 of manufacture (assumed variable costs only). Instead of –SPEND and +REV there are, respectively, CO2 emissions, +cg–t Pg–(t) dt, and emissions credits, –cg+t Pg+(t) dt. There is no inflation associated with CO2, but a discount rate of rint,CO2 is applied. ‘CO2 savings’ are –1× CO2 emissions, and are also considered relative to no PV and no battery.

Results: Effect of battery size on peak import and export Setting 2 = 0 again, the peak import across the year ( max( Pg-(t) ) ) was recorded. The effect of battery size on peak import depends on details of the household’s demand, not just its annual total. E.g. almost no effect on Houses 1, 3, 4, but large effect on House 6. A 7 kWh battery has no effect on House 2, but the effect becomes sizeable for 14 kWh. Peak import occurs in winter, when there is little PV energy to charge the battery, regardless of its size. Fig. 4. Peak import power across the year, as a function of battery capacity, for all houses. The low winter-time PV generation cannot charge the battery as quickly as the household demand drains it every day, resulting in the battery often running empty. The converse is true in summer, resulting in the battery being full nearly all the time. Even for battery capacity as large as 28 kWh, operating a greedy algorithm means the summer-time demand cannot empty the battery sufficiently each night, before the next morning’s PV generation completely fills it again, often before noon. The battery then cannot accept more PV energy, at the very time when grid export is highest, and when voltage violations are most likely. Fig. 5.

Results: Effect of battery size on peak import and export Setting 2 = 0 again, the peak import across the year ( max( Pg-(t) ) ) was recorded. The effect of battery size on peak import depends on details of the household’s demand, not just its annual total. E.g. almost no effect on Houses 1, 3, 4, but large effect on House 6. A 7 kWh battery has no effect on House 2, but the effect becomes sizeable for 14 kWh. Peak import occurs in winter, when there is little PV energy to charge the battery, regardless of its size. Fig. 4. Peak import power across the year, as a function of battery capacity, for all houses. The low winter-time PV generation cannot charge the battery as quickly as the household demand drains it every day, resulting in the battery often running empty. The converse is true in summer, resulting in the battery being full nearly all the time. Even for battery capacity as large as 28 kWh, operating a greedy algorithm means the summer-time demand cannot empty the battery sufficiently each night, before the next morning’s PV generation completely fills it again, often before noon. The battery then cannot accept more PV energy, at the very time when grid export is highest, and when voltage violations are most likely. Fig. 5. PV generation and energy stored in a 28 kWh battery, for House 4, whole year.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
