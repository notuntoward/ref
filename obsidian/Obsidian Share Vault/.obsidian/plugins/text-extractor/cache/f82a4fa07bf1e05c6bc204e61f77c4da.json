INTRODUCTION 1.1. Purpose and scope This Dispatch procedure is a power system operating procedure under clause 4.10 of the National Electricity Rules (NER). This procedure has effect only for the purposes set out in the NER. The NER and the National Electricity Law prevail over this procedure to the extent of any inconsistency. The purpose of this procedure is to provide instructions and guidelines covering market operations in relation to the operation of the power system. 1.2. Definitions and interpretation 1.2.1. Glossary Terms defined in the National Electricity Law and the NER have the same meanings in this procedure unless otherwise specified in this clause. Terms defined in the NER are intended to be identified in this procedure by italicising them, but failure to italicise a defined term does not affect its meaning. The words, phrases and abbreviations in the table below have the meanings set out opposite them when used in this procedure.

DISPATCH INSTRUCTIONS 2.1. Content of dispatch instructions (a) A dispatch instruction to produce, consume, reduce or transfer active power includes: (i) for a scheduled generating unit, a semi-scheduled generating unit, a scheduled network service, a scheduled load or a wholesale demand response unit, a Dispatch Target; (ii) for a semi-scheduled generating unit, a semi-dispatch cap flag; and (iii) for each scheduled resource in an Aggregate, a conformance mode. This indicates whether aggregated or individual dispatch conformance is required – refer section 2.6 for further details. (b) Dispatch Targets for all scheduled generating units, semi-scheduled generating units, scheduled network services, scheduled loads and wholesale demand response units are determined by NEMDE after co-optimising the energy market with the FCAS markets. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 10 of 62 (c) A dispatch instruction will also include a Dispatch Mode for scheduled resources with a bid dispatch inflexibility profile. The Dispatch Mode is a number which indicates the required target mode of the scheduled resource at the end of the trading interval based on the unit’s progression through its bid dispatch inflexibility profile. (i) For generating units, the Dispatch Mode represents a commitment dispatch instruction to start, synchronise and follow their dispatch inflexibility profile. (ii) For scheduled loads and wholesale demand response units, the Dispatch Mode represents a commitment dispatch instruction to prepare for and follow their dispatch inflexibility profile. (d) Scheduled resources in an Aggregate with a bid dispatch inflexibility profile can commit and follow dispatch instructions in aggregate when the Dispatch Mode of the scheduled resource(s) indicate that the resource(s) are in normal operation (i.e., after synchronisation, ramping up to the minimum loading level and spending minimum time required at or above the minimum loading level). The relevant Registered Participant must ensure that its latest dispatch offer reflects the actual intentions for the relevant inflexible scheduled resource(s). 2.2. Issue of dispatch instructions (a) Dispatch instructions will be issued electronically via the AEMO Electricity Market Management System (EMMS) interfaces. (b) Where possible, dispatch instructions for generating units will also be issued electronically via the automatic generation control system (AGC). A generating unit providing regulation services must be set up to receive and respond to dispatch instructions issued via the AGC. For a generating unit not providing regulation services, it is the responsibility of the Generator to notify AEMO whether they wish to be set up to receive dispatch instructions via the AGC. (c) A generating unit will not be issued dispatch instructions via AGC unless the unit indicates via SCADA that its AGC is available for remote control and AEMO selects the unit to remote AGC. (d) AEMO may issue dispatch instructions in some other form if in its reasonable opinion the normal processes are not available. (e) AEMO’s AGC may issue a single dispatch instruction covering all scheduled resources in an Aggregate, in respect of a Target Aggregate which is a two-DUID scheduled generating unit and scheduled load pair (e.g. a battery) - refer to section 2.6.5 for further details. 2.3. Automatic Generation Control The AGC serves two purposes in the NEM. They are: (a) Energy market dispatch of generating units which are on remote control: Dispatch results from the NEMDE run are ramped into the AGC (to prevent any large step change in megawatt output). In general: (i) any generating unit not dispatched for regulation FCAS will be ramped to its Dispatch Target DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 11 of 62 (ii) in respect of a Target Aggregate that receives a single AGC set-point, if no scheduled resources in the Aggregate are dispatched for regulation FCAS then AGC will ramp the Aggregate to its Aggregate Dispatch Target. (b) Regulating FCAS dispatch: Actual frequency and time error values are compared to the desired frequency and time error to calculate the Area Control Error (ACE). This value is then used by the AGC to determine the desired megawatt outputs of generating units dispatched for regulation FCAS. 2.4. Semi-Scheduled Generating Units (a) Semi-scheduled generating units will generally be intermittent generation (typically, wind and solar farms) greater than 30 MW. (b) The central dispatch process determines the dispatch of semi-scheduled generating units in a similar manner to scheduled generating units, on the basis of bid price bands and availability. However, for semi-scheduled generating units, the availability information is calculated as the lower of the bid energy Maximum Availability (Max Avail) and the unconstrained intermittent generation forecast (UIGF) provided either by AEMO’s AWEFS/ASEFS or by the participant. SCADA is a primary input to the production of AWEFS/ASEFS dispatch forecasts and the Generator must rectify failed SCADA as soon as possible1. (c) The central dispatch process determines for each semi-scheduled generating unit both a Dispatch Target and an associated semi-dispatch cap flag, and electronically issues these confidentially in a dispatch instruction to the relevant Semi-Scheduled Generator. If the semi- scheduled generating unit is in a Cap Aggregate, then the semi-dispatch cap flag is replaced by the conformance mode. (d) The dispatch instruction for a semi-scheduled generating unit not in an Aggregate requires that unit’s active power output to be capped at the Dispatch Target value set by AEMO only when its semi-dispatch cap flag is set to ‘TRUE’. This value is called its “semi-dispatch cap”. (e) Otherwise, if its semi-dispatch cap flag is set to ‘FALSE’ the semi-scheduled generating unit’s active power output may only deviate from its Dispatch Target due to energy source availability, physical capability or when providing any service required under the NER. (f) For a semi-scheduled generating unit in a Cap Aggregate, the requirement in paragraph (d) applies, except that the conformance mode is used instead of the semi-dispatch cap flag. The conformance mode indicates whether the semi-scheduled generating unit must either individually conform or conform in aggregate with other units in the Aggregate – refer to section 2.6.1 for further details. (g) For a semi-scheduled generating unit in a Mixed Aggregate, both the conformance mode and the semi-dispatch cap flag are used: • if conformance mode = 2, then the semi-scheduled generating unit must individually conform in accordance with paragraph (d) • if conformance mode = 1 and the semi-dispatch cap flag is set to ‘TRUE', then the semi- scheduled generating unit must either conform in accordance with paragraph (d) or conform in aggregate with other units in the Aggregate – refer to section 2.6.2 for further details. 1 Further information and resources for Semi-Scheduled Generators on forecasting and dispatch requirements, SCADA signals, etc. can be found at: https://aemo.com.au/en/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/nem-forecasting-and- planning/operational-forecasting/solar-and-wind-energy-forecasting DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 12 of 62 • if conformance mode = 1 and the semi-dispatch cap flag is set to ‘FALSE’, then the semi- scheduled generating unit must either conform in accordance with paragraph (e) or conform in aggregate with other units in the Aggregate – refer to section 2.6.2 for further details. (h) The semi-dispatch cap flag is set to ‘TRUE’ for a semi-scheduled generating unit when either one of the following conditions is satisfied for a trading interval (called a semi-dispatch interval): (i) The Dispatch Target is limited by Binding or Violated Network or FCAS Constraint: The generating unit’s forecast output (it’s UIGF) is explicitly limited by any binding or violated network constraint or ancillary service constraint equation, and if the actual output were to exceed the value of the semi-dispatch cap, this would result in violating (or further violating) that constraint equation; or (ii) The Dispatch Target is otherwise below the UIGF: The generating unit’s forecast output (it’s UIGF) is not explicitly limited by a binding or violated network constraint or ancillary service constraint equation, but is limited as a result of either a purely inter-regional limitation, or an offer or market-related limitation, the latter including: (A) Unit Ramp Rate (B) Unit Fixed Loading Level (C) Non-dispatch of uneconomic price bands (D) Marginal dispatch of economic price bands (E) Bid Max Avail (i) For all other trading intervals where neither of the above conditions is met for a particular semi-scheduled generating unit, its semi-dispatch cap flag is set to ‘FALSE’ for that trading interval (called a non semi-dispatch interval). 2.5. Wholesale Demand Response Units NER clause 4.9.2B(e) requires AEMO to make, as a power system operating procedure, a procedure setting out arrangements for notifying a Demand Response Service Provider whether it is being given a dispatch instruction in relation to its wholesale demand response in a trading interval. This section makes provision for this requirement, as well as the information in relation to the central dispatch process. (a) The central dispatch process determines a Dispatch Target for each wholesale demand response unit, and electronically issues this confidentially in a dispatch instruction to the relevant Demand Response Service Provider. (b) A dispatch instruction is issued for every trading interval regardless of the Dispatch Target value. For example, when a wholesale demand response unit is bid unavailable for dispatch for a period of time, a Dispatch Target of 0 MW is issued for every trading interval in that period. (c) The central dispatch process determines Dispatch Targets for wholesale demand response units in a similar manner to scheduled generating units, on the basis of bid price bands and availability with both treated as a supply when balancing electricity supply and demand. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 13 of 62 (d) A Dispatch Target for a wholesale demand response unit is the required reduction in active power consumption (in MW) below the baseline consumption of the wholesale demand response unit, to be achieved at the end of the trading interval to which it relates. This differs to a Dispatch Target for a scheduled load, which is the required active power consumption. (e) The bid available capacity (in MW) of a wholesale demand response unit is its total consumption reduction capacity available for dispatch. 2.6. Aggregate Systems (a) Under NER clause 11.145.16, a Generator with a generating system that comprises two or more scheduled resources is permitted to conform in aggregate to dispatch instructions for those scheduled resources (referred to in this Procedure as aggregated dispatch conformance), excluding any scheduled resources for which AEMO has required resource level compliance in the dispatch instruction (referred to in this Procedure as individual dispatch conformance). (b) A Generator can apply to AEMO to register all or some of the scheduled resources in its generating system for aggregated dispatch conformance (the registered scheduled resources being an Aggregate System, or Aggregate). (c) AEMO determines whether the Aggregate is a Cap Aggregate, a Mixed Aggregate or a Target Aggregate, in accordance with sections 2.6.1(a), 2.6.2(a) or 2.6.3(a) respectively. (d) In accordance with section 2.8, all scheduled resources in an Aggregate must be capable of linear ramping, in aggregate and individually, if individual dispatch conformance is required. (e) AEMO will automatically register as a Target Aggregate a generating system that only comprises batteries classified as a scheduled generating unit and scheduled load pair for the purpose of dispatch conformance monitoring. 2.6.1. Aggregated Dispatch Conformance – Cap Aggregate (a) A Cap Aggregate is an Aggregate that only comprises semi-scheduled generating units (for example, a generating system comprising a wind and solar semi-scheduled generating unit). (b) All semi-scheduled generating units in a Cap Aggregate use the conformance mode in their dispatch instructions and ignore the semi-dispatch cap flag. (c) The semi-scheduled generating units in a Cap Aggregate with conformance mode = 0 in their dispatch instruction are not required to cap their active power either in aggregate or individually. The conformance mode for all semi-scheduled generating units is set = 0 if no units have their semi-dispatch cap flag set. (d) The semi-scheduled generating units in a Cap Aggregate with conformance mode = 1 in their dispatch instruction are required to conform to their dispatch instructions by capping their Aggregate Active Power at their Aggregate Dispatch Target (aka Aggregate Dispatch Cap). (e) The conformance mode for a semi-scheduled generating unit in a Cap Aggregate is set = 1 in its dispatch instruction if the semi-dispatch cap flag is set for any semi-scheduled generating unit in the Cap Aggregate unless individual dispatch conformance is required on that semi-scheduled generating unit (conformance mode = 2). Figure 1 below shows the dispatch conformance logic for a Cap Aggregate. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 14 of 62 2.6.2. Aggregated Dispatch Conformance – Mixed Aggregate (a) A Mixed Aggregate is an Aggregate that comprises scheduled generating units and which may also include semi-scheduled generating units or scheduled loads (but excluding a scheduled generating unit and scheduled load pair for a single physical plant, which is a Target Aggregate). (b) All scheduled resources in a Mixed Aggregate use the conformance mode in their dispatch instructions. (c) The conformance mode for a scheduled resource in a Mixed Aggregate is set = 1 in its dispatch instruction unless individual dispatch conformance is required on the resource (conformance mode = 2). (d) If any scheduled resource in a Mixed Aggregate with conformance mode = 1 is not conforming to its individual Dispatch Target for a trading interval, then all resources in the Mixed Aggregate are deemed to be participating in aggregated dispatch conformance for that trading interval. (e) A semi-scheduled generating unit in a Mixed Aggregate uses the semi-dispatch cap flag in its dispatch instruction to determine whether to cap its active power to its individual Dispatch Target or (if its conformance mode = 1) to participate in aggregated dispatch conformance. (f) The scheduled resources in a Mixed Aggregate that are participating in aggregated dispatch conformance are required to conform to their dispatch instructions as follows: (i) their Aggregate Active Power cannot be greater than their Aggregate Dispatch Target; and (ii) their Aggregate Active Power cannot be less than their Aggregate Dispatch Target, if the Net Scheduled Active Power is less than the Net Scheduled Dispatch Target. Figure 2 below shows the dispatch conformance logic for a Mixed Aggregate. 2.6.3. Aggregated Dispatch Conformance – Target Aggregate (a) A Target Aggregate is an Aggregate that comprises a scheduled generating unit and scheduled load pair, pertaining to a single physical plant. (b) The conformance mode for all scheduled resources in a Target Aggregate is set = 1 in its dispatch instruction. (c) The scheduled resources in a Target Aggregate are required to conform to their dispatch instructions by controlling their Aggregate Active Power to meet their Aggregate Dispatch Target. Figure 3 below shows the dispatch conformance logic for a Target Aggregate.

Individual Dispatch Conformance (a) The aggregated dispatch conformance requirements are subject to, and overridden by, any individual dispatch conformance requirement on a scheduled resource or the provision of any service required from that scheduled resource under the NER. (b) AEMO may specify in a dispatch instruction for a scheduled resource in an Aggregate that the relevant scheduled resource is required to operate in accordance with that dispatch instruction where a network constraint would be violated if the scheduled resource were to operate other than in accordance with the dispatch instruction, due to technical characteristics of the scheduled resource. (c) Table 3 shows the technical characteristics that might require individual dispatch conformance for a scheduled resource in an Aggregate, for example to facilitate the maintenance of stability or the delivery of services required for power system security. (d) If individual dispatch conformance is required for a scheduled resource in an Aggregate, this is indicated by conformance mode = 2 in that resource’s dispatch instruction. (e) For a semi-scheduled generating unit, individual dispatch conformance requires that their active power is capped at their Dispatch Target (that is, Dispatch Cap) and may only deviate from its Dispatch Target due to energy source availability, physical capability (as defined in section 2.8(b)(vii) and (viii)) or when providing any FCAS or other service required under the NER. (f) For a scheduled generating unit or a scheduled load, individual dispatch conformance requires that its active power meets its Dispatch Target and may only deviate from that Dispatch Target due to physical capability (as defined in section 2.8(b)(vii) and (viii)) or when providing any FCAS or other service required under the NER. Table 3 Technical characteristics that might require individual dispatch conformance Characteristics Description Network Thermal Limit Power system security could be violated if additional firming were to occur beyond its full delivery of enabled FCAS regulation based on AEMO’s AGC set-point Network Support Constraint to ensure delivery of a network support and control ancillary service under a network support agreement Quality of Supply Limits to manage voltage unbalance, negative sequence voltage, harmonics, flicker or voltage step changes System Strength System strength limit Transient Stability Transient stability limit for a fault on a network element Voltage Stability Steady state voltage collapse or voltage stability limit DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 19 of 62 2.6.5. FCAS and Aggregated Dispatch Conformance (a) Each scheduled resource in an Aggregate that is registered for regulation FCAS (or if the Generator otherwise requests to receive dispatch instructions via AGC) will receive a separate AEMO AGC set-point. The exception to this is described in paragraph (b) below. (b) For a two-DUID scheduled battery (scheduled generating unit/scheduled load pair) that is a Target Aggregate and is registered for regulation FCAS (or if the Generator otherwise requests to receive dispatch instructions via AGC for such an Aggregate that is not registered for regulation FCAS), then AEMO will set up its AGC system to issue a single dispatch instruction covering all scheduled resources in the Aggregate (aggregate set-point). The Generator must set up a complying AGC system to receive this aggregate set-point and control the scheduled resources. (c) When a scheduled resource in an Aggregate is enabled for any regulation FCAS then the resource is not permitted to firm or offset its active power against other resources in the Aggregate (that is, cannot participate in aggregated dispatch conformance). AEMO will require individual dispatch conformance for that scheduled resource (conformance mode = 2 in its dispatch instruction). (d) At other times, including when a scheduled resource in an Aggregate is enabled for any contingency FCAS only, that scheduled resource is permitted to firm or offset its active power against that of other scheduled resources to the Aggregate Dispatch Target, subject to there being no impact on any scheduled resource’s ability to provide its enabled contingency FCAS response. (e) A scheduled resource in an Aggregate must not offset the delivery of FCAS response or other service required under the NER from other scheduled resources in the Aggregate. (f) To achieve the objectives in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e), a scheduled resource in an Aggregate must: • maintain its enabled FCAS reserve (headroom for FCAS raise, footroom for FCAS lower) for each FCAS, and cannot transfer any enabled FCAS to other scheduled resources in the Aggregate, and • operate within the effective FCAS lower and upper breakpoints relevant to the amount of FCAS enabled for each FCAS (operating limits), to ensure that the enabled FCAS can be delivered. The Generator will need to determine these operating limits for each trading interval based on the FCAS bid trapezium and the enabled quantity for each type of FCAS. Figures 4 and 5 below provide a generalised example of the operating limits that a scheduled resource providing FCAS must operate within to ensure its enabled FCAS reserves are maintained while allowing room for aggregated dispatch conformance with other scheduled resources in the Aggregate.

Dispatch of Non-Market Ancillary Services Refer to SO_OP_3708 Non-Market Ancillary Services. 2.8. Ramp rates in energy dispatch instructions (a) As part of a dispatch instruction for energy, NER clauses 4.9.5(a)(3) and 4.9.5(a2)(3) require AEMO to specify a ramp rate or a specific target time for a generating unit or a wholesale demand response unit to reach an applicable outcome (being Dispatch Target) specified in the dispatch instruction. This section makes provision for this requirement, which extends to scheduled loads subject to capability. Note that NEMDE already accounts for the maximum and minimum ramp rate requirements (described in section 9) when it produces a Dispatch Target. (b) Absent a ramp rate provided directly in a dispatch instruction: (i) scheduled generating units; (ii) scheduled loads; (iii) wholesale demand response units; (iv) semi-scheduled generating units not in an Aggregate, during semi-dispatch intervals or when constrained by a Local Limit,; and scheduled resources in an Aggregate, must linearly ramp (either individually [if not in an Aggregate, or in an Aggregate but individual dispatch conformance is required] or in aggregate with other scheduled resources in an Aggregate [if individual dispatch conformance is not required]) their active power across the trading interval in a uniform way, from their initial active power at the time of receiving the dispatch instruction to the Dispatch Target at the end of the trading interval, subject to: (v) energy source availability (for semi-scheduled generating units); (vi) physical limitations of the facility; (vii) technical capabilities of the facility, which must, as a minimum, be consistent with its applicable performance standards; and (viii) provision of any service required under the NER. (c) Outside of semi-dispatch intervals, intervals where neither aggregated nor individual dispatch conformance is required for a Cap Aggregate, or intervals where they are constrained by a Local Limit, semi-scheduled generating units must either linearly ramp to their Dispatch Target or generate in accordance with their energy source availability (subject to paragraphs (b)(vi), (b)(vii) and (b)(viii) above). Figure 6 below shows the expected dispatch for a semi-scheduled generating unit assuming no limiting factors. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 22 of 62 Figure 6 Semi-scheduled generating unit linear ramping with no limiting factors Note that for “Trading Interval #1”, the semi-scheduled generating unit is deviating from the red dashed “Dispatch Target” line (being a straight line between two successive Dispatch Targets) due to variations in its available energy source (shown as “Actual Dispatch”). Figure 7 shows the expected dispatch for a semi-scheduled generating unit that cannot sustain its linear ramp due to a reduction in energy available.

NON-CONFORMANCE WITH DISPATCH TARGETS 3.1. Principles of Conformance Monitoring Conformance Monitoring is a process that AEMO applies to scheduled generating units, semi- scheduled generating units, scheduled loads and Aggregate Systems using the AEMO Conformance Module. The aim of the process is to identify and implement corrective measures if a Market Participant fails to follow a dispatch instruction. The AEMO Conformance Module automatically flags non-responsive scheduled generating units, semi-scheduled generating units, scheduled loads and Aggregate Systems based on the SCADA quantities used by the central dispatch process. Non-conformance action then follows in a Manual or Automated manner. Two trigger mechanisms are utilised to identify the severity of non-conformance. These are the Small Error Trigger and the Large Error Trigger. Corrective measures are then taken depending on the severity and duration of the non-conformance event. The corrective measures are a logical defined sequence of actions aimed at resolving the mismatch between actual and total dispatched generation in the NEM. In addition to the communication steps set out in this section, participants should contact the AEMO control room when clarification of conformance status is necessary. The Non-conformance Calculations and Process Overview, including worked examples, are detailed in Appendix A of this document. AEMO does not apply the Conformance Monitoring process to wholesale demand response units and scheduled network services. For wholesale demand response units there is a separate post- event dispatch non-compliance analysis performed. For scheduled network services, AEMO monitors dispatch conformance using an offline process. 3.1.1. FCAS Conformance If an Ancillary Service Provider is enabled to provide a service and fails to respond in the manner expected by the market ancillary service specification (as determined in AEMO’s reasonable opinion), then the NER provide for AEMO to take certain actions, including: (a) The FCAS generating unit or load is to be declared and identified as non-conforming (b) AEMO must advise the Market Participant that the FCAS generating unit or load is identified as non-conforming and request a reason for the non-conformance. The Market Participant must promptly provide a reason. (c) AEMO may set a fixed constraint for the relevant FCAS and the Market Participant must ensure that the FCAS generating unit or load complies with the fixed constraint. AEMO may also require Ancillary Service Providers to periodically report on their FCAS conformance and their management of enabled FCAS headroom and footroom. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 24 of 62 3.2. Generating Units, Scheduled Loads and Aggregate Systems Plant in this category may be processed by AEMO in a Manual or Automated manner. The Conformance Data Report indicates the mode of operation at any time. Manual and Automated processing are described in this section. 3.2.1. Manual Processing If the AEMO Conformance Module is operating in Manual mode for a region and a non- conformance exists for a scheduled generating unit, semi-scheduled generating unit, scheduled load or Aggregate System in that region but it does not cause power system security violations, the following actions are to be taken: (a) Identify non-responsive scheduled generating unit, semi-scheduled generating unit, scheduled load or Aggregate System using the AEMO Conformance Module. (b) Contact Market Participant and request a reason for the non-conformance. Log the reason given. Note that the Conformance Data Report is available to the participant each trading interval, so any non-response issue should have already been observed. The Conformance Status at this point will be Not-Responding. Note that in Manual operating mode, the Conformance Status as reported by the AEMO Conformance Module will not advance beyond Not-Responding. All subsequent actions are manually applied and involve telephone communication between AEMO and the Market Participant. (c) If modification to the bid is necessary to achieve a realistic real-time dispatch, request the Market Participant to submit a rebid to reflect the current performance of the plant. (d) If the Market Participant fails to follow the Dispatch Targets or to submit a rebid within two trading intervals, the relevant generating unit, scheduled load or Aggregate System is to be declared non-conforming. If required, AEMO will set the unit at an output determined by AEMO so that a physically realisable dispatch is achieved. This will be achieved by AEMO applying a non-conformance constraint. The constraint violation penalty factor for this constraint will be set at 1160 x MPC. (e) The Market Participant will be advised that the generating unit, scheduled load or Aggregate System has been declared non-conforming and that a non-conformance constraint has been applied. Note that the non-conformance constraint action will result in the error being reduced, this may result in the reported Conformance Status returning to Normal. This is to be expected as the error has been corrected and the Non-Conforming declaration is being processed manually. (f) The generating unit, scheduled load or Aggregate System is to remain at the loading determined by the non-conformance constraint until AEMO is advised by the Market Participant that it is now capable of following dispatch instructions. 3.2.2. Automated Processing If the AEMO Conformance Module is operating in Automatic mode (normal mode) and a non- conformance exists but does not cause power system security violations, the following actions are to be taken: (g) Observe non-responsive generating unit, scheduled load or Aggregate System using the AEMO Conformance Module. The participant will be in an informed position as the Conformance Data Report is published each trading interval. (h) The Conformance Status change observed in the AEMO Conformance Module is identical to the Conformance Data Report content. The Market Participant also receives a message DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 25 of 62 corresponding to the Conformance Status in each Report. The sequence of Conformance Status change and message content is as follows: (i) Off-Target Participant Message: Please move to dispatch target or rebid (ii) Not-Responding Participant Message: Please move to dispatch target or rebid (iii) NC-Pending Participant Message: Unit not responding to dispatch target. Non-conformance action pending (iv) Non-Conforming Participant Message: Unit declared Non-conforming (NC). NC constraint is invoked. AEMO is requesting a reason for the NC For an Aggregate System where aggregated dispatch conformance applies, the sequence of Conformance Status change and message content is as follows: (i) Off-Target Participant Message: Please move to aggregate dispatch target or rebid (ii) Not-Responding Participant Message: Please move to aggregate dispatch target or rebid (iii) NC-Pending Participant Message: Unit(s) not responding to aggregate dispatch target. Non- conformance action pending (iv) Non-Conforming Participant Message: ADG declared non-conforming (NC). ADG NC constraint invoked. AEMO is requesting a reason for the NC. (i) Note that the non-conformance constraint application mentioned in this automated process is the same as that applied for the manual process. (j) If the Market Participant has not contacted AEMO in a reasonable time following the Non- Conformance Declaration then AEMO will contact the Market Participant and request a reason for the non-conformance to the dispatch instruction. AEMO will log the reason given. (k) The generating unit, scheduled load or Aggregate System is to remain at the loading determined by the non-conformance constraint until AEMO is advised by the Market Participant that it is now capable of following dispatch instructions. For an Aggregate System, this will be the aggregate loading level determined by the aggregate non- conformance constraint. 3.3. [This section is deleted] DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 26 of 62 3.4. Conditions to apply to registered Fast Start generating units (a) Registered Fast Start generating units may immediately be declared non-conforming if: (i) a unit has synchronised and increased its generation level greater than 0 MW without having received a dispatch instruction from AEMO; or (ii) a unit has received a dispatch instruction to reduce to 0 MW and fails to meet that dispatch instruction. (b) The above also applies to scheduled resources in an Aggregate when aggregated dispatch conformance applies. The declaration of non-conformance will remain in place until AEMO is satisfied that the relevant scheduled resource will accurately respond to future dispatch instructions. The Non-Conformance Declaration may be implemented in an Automated or Manual manner by AEMO depending on the current operating mode of the AEMO Conformance Module. In either case AEMO will initiate communication with the Market Participant for any accelerated Non-Conformance Declaration. (c) Appropriate participant staff should contact AEMO to confirm when the unit is able to follow Dispatch Targets. 3.5. Non-Conformance constraints (a) When a scheduled resource is declared as non-conforming, AEMO may apply a constraint. In most cases this will be a dynamic constraint where the Right Hand Side equals the telemetered generation, consumption or transfer. For an Aggregate, the Right Hand Side of the aggregate non-conformance constraint will equal the sum of the telemetered generation or consumption for all scheduled resources in the Aggregate System. (b) However, in some cases this dynamic constraint is not appropriate (e.g., it may cause or not remove a security violation), AEMO may apply a different constraint formulation or may determine not to apply a specific non-conformance constraint. 3.6. Market Reporting of Non-Conformance If a declaration of non-conformance is made then this will be advised to all Market Participants before the end of next day. The notice should include the following details: (a) identity of the scheduled generating unit, semi-scheduled generating unit, scheduled load or scheduled network service; (b) trading intervals affected; and (c) magnitude of non-conformance (the difference between the actual generation and the Dispatch Target). In the case of a non-conforming Aggregate System, the notice will refer to the Aggregate System, all scheduled resources in the Aggregate System, and to the aggregate magnitude of non- conformance. 3.7. Accelerated non-conformance process It is to be noted that at any stage of pursuing the non-conformance, if the Market Participant in respect of the scheduled generating unit, semi-scheduled generating unit, scheduled load, scheduled network service or Aggregate System clearly indicates that the plant will not be conforming to dispatch instructions, the details of the discussion / communication will be logged and the scheduled generating unit, semi-scheduled generating unit, scheduled load, scheduled network DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 27 of 62 service or Aggregate System may be declared immediately as non-conforming. Then the listed actions above for non-conformance will be taken as appropriate. 4. COMMITMENT AND DE-COMMITMENT OF SCHEDULED GENERATING UNITS 4.1. Self-Commitment (a) A scheduled generating unit is self-committing if it has a self-dispatch level of greater than 0 MW, where the self-dispatch level equals the sum of all energy bid in offloading (that is, negatively priced) price bands in its dispatch offer. (b) Clauses 4.9.6(a)(1) and 4.9.7(a) of the NER require a Scheduled Generator to confirm with AEMO the expected synchronising time and de-synchronising time at least 1 hour before, and update this advice 5 minutes before synchronising or de-synchronising. (c) Scheduled generating units that are self-committing are not required to further inform AEMO of their expected synchronising or de-synchronising times providing the relevant bid has been received by AEMO at least 1 hour prior to the expected synchronising or de- synchronising time, unless specifically requested by AEMO. 4.2. Fast-Start Generators that choose not to Self-Commit (a) Fast-start generating units that choose not to self-commit, are subject to the same obligations as all other Generators in relation to PASA (NER clause 3.7.2 and 3.7.3). They are not, however, subject to the requirement in NER clause 4.9.6(a) to confirm expected synchronisation times with AEMO. Those generating units are subject to dispatch instructions from AEMO under NER clause 4.9.6(b). Those instructions must include a synchronisation time nominated by AEMO. This will be via the normal dispatch process. (b) Clause 4.9.6(b)(3) of the NER requires a Generator that receives such a dispatch instruction to advise AEMO promptly if it cannot meet the nominated synchronisation time set out in that instruction. (c) However, if a fast-start generator chooses to self-commit then that generating unit is subject to the same requirements in relation to advice to AEMO regarding synchronising or de- synchronising times as other self-committing generating units. 5. DISPATCH RE-RUNS There are a number of conditions that could trigger an automatic re-run of the dispatch solution. The automatic re-run solution is completed and published within the original trading interval. 5.1. Over Constrained Dispatch (OCD) Re-Runs (a) The automation of this process detects, adjusts, re-runs and reports an adjusted energy price for a high percentage of over-constrained trading intervals thereby allowing the automatic publishing of correct spot prices in real time. (b) The OCD re-run process is initiated when an interconnector, intra-regional network constraint or ancillary service constraint is violated, and one or more of the following applies: (i) An energy spot price is greater than or equal to MPC or; (ii) An energy spot price is less than or equal to the Market Floor Price or (iii) Any ancillary service price is greater than or equal to MPC. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 28 of 62 Refer to the flowchart below for further clarification of the OCD process. Section 1 also includes a reference to the AEMO website. Figure 8 Over Constrained Dispatch Re-Run Flow Diagram Original NEMDE Run Is there an OCD condition? Automatic Inline OCD rerun* Stop No Yes Automatic Review Is OCD condition resolved? Stop Yes Automatic issue of MPDI market notice Automatic Offline OCD rerun Is OCD condition resolved?

In such cases all regional energy and market ancillary service prices are revised from the OCD re-run. (d) Commitment of fast start plant is determined on the basis of the unit commitment undertaken prior to the initial unrelaxed pricing run. (e) If the OCD is resolved after the Automatic Inline review, then no market notice will be issued. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 29 of 62 (f) If an automatic OCD re-run occurs, then the original run prices (greater than MPC or less than the Market Floor Price) are not published. 5.2. NEMDE second run for Basslink dispatch (a) There are two important characteristics of Basslink that can cause NEMDE to be unable to find the optimal solution in a significant number of trading intervals: (i) No-go Zone - NEMDE is a linear program and will attempt to produce Dispatch Targets anywhere in the no-go zone if demanded by the market conditions. (ii) FCAS Transfer Capability - When operating at levels greater than 50 MW in either direction, Basslink has the capability to transfer FCAS from one region to another. This allows, for example, the FCAS requirement for the Tasmanian region to be met in part by scheduling additional FCAS on the mainland, if it is economical to do so. (b) NEMDE performs two runs for every trading interval. The first run uses the SCADA indication for the status of the Basslink frequency controller, and for the additional NEMDE run the input status of the Basslink frequency controller is assumed to be switched off. i.e., if the Basslink frequency controller is turned off, the two runs are identical. (c) The final solution and the associated NEMDE input status of the Basslink frequency controller is decided by selecting the run with the least cost objective function. This allows: (i) NEMDE to increase the set of allowable dispatch outcomes that satisfy the complex model of Basslink available to NEMDE so that it can maximise the value of spot market trade, as required under clause 3.8.1(a) of the NER. (ii) A reduction in unnecessary counter price flows across the Basslink HVDC interconnector. 6. AGGREGATE DISPATCH ERROR 6.1. Background (a) Aggregate Dispatch Error is an adjustment to the Dispatch regional demand forecast. This adjustment is based on the following calculation for each unit not performing regulation duty: ADE = Target value – Actual Value (b) ADE will be positive when units are operating below targets and negative when units are operating above targets. The ADE for each unit in a region is summed to produce an ADE for that region. (c) The resulting ADE value for each region is then added to the respective region demand forecast in the next trading interval. 6.2. ADE calculation (a) Using a 30-minute time weighted average for the region ADE provides a more accurate predictor of the level of sustained dispatch error that should apply as a forecast demand adjustment in the next trading interval. (b) The following calculation of each region ADE is performed. The calculation is based on 6 data samples at 5 minute intervals with the most recent sample being given a weight of 6 and the oldest a weight of 1. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 30 of 62 Time Weighted Average ADE = ((Sample 1 * Weight1) + (Sample2 * Weight2) +… + (Sample6 * Weight6)) / (Weight1 + Weight2 + . … + Weight6) (c) This calculation will be performed on a regional basis rather than on an individual generating unit basis. 6.3. Frequency element in ADE (a) To ensure that any frequency deviation is not caused by or exacerbated by the ADE a frequency element is introduced into the ADE calculation. This ensures that if a frequency deviation occurs only ADE in a direction that would help to restore frequency is passed to the market systems. IF Frequency > high dead band value AND ADE > 0 THEN ADE = 0 ELSE ADE = ADE Conversely If Frequency < low dead band value AND ADE < 0 THEN ADE = 0 ELSE ADE = ADE (b) To ensure short duration frequency excursions are not passed to the ADE calculation the frequency input is a 60 second time weighted average. (c) The calculation is based on 6 data samples at 10 second intervals with the most recent sample being given a weight of 6 and the oldest a weight of 1. Time Weighted Average Hz = ((Sample 1 * Weight1) + (Sample2 * Weight2) +…(Sample6 * Weight6)) / (Weight1 + Weight2 +. …Weight6) (d) A separate calculation is performed for each NEM region. The frequency dead bands are: (i) Tasmania ±0.05Hz (ii) Other regions ±0.025Hz 6.4. ADE cap values To ensure excessive ADE values do not compromise power system security the ADE for each region is capped to the following values: (a) Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria = ±50 MW (b) South Australia ±25 MW (c) Tasmania ±25 MW. 7. DIRECTIONS AND INTERVENTION PRICING (a) Where, during an intervention trading interval, AEMO is required to set a price at a value which AEMO considers would have applied had an AEMO intervention event not occurred, NEMDE will be run twice: (i) First, the dispatch or outturn run, which includes reserve contracts or direction constraints to determine Dispatch Targets. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 31 of 62 (ii) Second, the intervention price run, to determine spot and ancillary service prices and does not contain reserve contracts or direction constraints. (b) For more information regarding directions and intervention pricing refer to AEMO’s SO_OP_3707 (Intervention, Direction and Clause 4.8.9 Instructions) and Intervention Pricing Methodology. 8. REVIEW OF CONSTRAINTS (a) Constraint equations that are overly conservative or not functioning correctly can unnecessarily constrain the market. If such constraint equations are identified they can be removed from dispatch and pre-dispatch by either blocking the constraint equation or removing it from the constraint set. Only constraints associated with thermal limits and not transient or voltage stability constraints will be removed. (b) Until the constraints are revised, the power system will be managed by Contingency Analysis, Constraint Automation and/or discretionary constraints. 9. RAMP RATE REQUIREMENTS A Scheduled Generator, Semi-Scheduled Generator, Demand Response Service Provider or Market Participant with generating units, scheduled network services, scheduled loads and/or wholesale demand response units must provide up and down ramp rates, and maximum ramp rates as outlined below. 9.1. Up and Down Ramp Rate Requirements (a) Aggregated2 scheduled generating units, semi-scheduled generating units, scheduled loads and scheduled network services have higher minimum ramp rate requirements than non- aggregated units. (b) For scheduled network services or scheduled loads: (i) If aggregated, Minimum Ramp Rate = 3 x No. of units within the aggregation (ii) If non-aggregated, Minimum Ramp Rate = 3 MW/min. (c) For scheduled generating units:  If aggregated, Minimum Ramp Rate: = Sum[Minimum (3 MW/minute, 3% of the maximum capacity)per generating unit]All units The minimum ramp rate calculation of 3 MW/min or 3% of the maximum capacity is applied to each generating unit within the aggregation. The minimum ramp rate requirement applied to the DUID is the summation of the minimum ramp rates of all generating units within the aggregation. (i) If non-aggregated, Minimum Ramp Rate = Minimum (3 MW/minute, 3% of the maximum capacity). (d) For semi-scheduled generating units: (i) If aggregated, Minimum Ramp Rate 2 Aggregation for scheduled generating units, scheduled loads and scheduled network services refers to any more than one resource within a DUID. Aggregation for semi-scheduled generating units is based on Rule Clause 3.8.3 (i), i.e., semi-scheduled generating units registered as a single unit as per Rule Clause 2.2.7(i) are treated as non-aggregated for ramp rate purposes. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 32 of 62 = Sum[Minimum (3 MW/minute, 3% of the maximum capacity)per cluster]All clusters (ii) If non-aggregated, Minimum Ramp Rate = Minimum (3 MW/minute, 3% of the maximum capacity). (e) For wholesale demand response units: There are no minimum ramp rate requirements under the NER. However, due to the system limitations, the bidding system requires the Demand Response Service Provider to fill the bid ‘reason’ field in the bid if the bid ramp rate is less than the Minimum Ramp Rate specified in section 9.1.(b). (f) All values provided must be rounded down to the nearest whole number greater than or equal to 1 MW/minute. Ramp rates cannot be greater than the relevant maximum ramp rate. 9.2. Ramp Rate Less than Requirements A ramp rate less than the minimum requirements specified in section 9.1 may be provided if an event physically prevents or makes it unsafe for the relevant plant to operate. In this case: (a) The ramp rate provided must be the maximum the plant can safely attain at that time. (b) The participant must simultaneously provide a brief, verifiable and specific reason why the ramp rate is below the requirements. This is to be included in the ‘reason’ field in the participant bid. 9.3. Maximum Ramp Rate Less than Requirements A maximum ramp rate less than the minimum requirements specified above may be provided if an event physically prevents or makes it unsafe for the relevant generating unit, scheduled load or scheduled network service to operate. In this case: (a) The maximum ramp rate provided must be the maximum the relevant plant can safely attain at that time. (b) The participant must provide a brief, verifiable and specific reason why the maximum ramp rate is below the requirements. (c) In this instance the participant has reported on the limitation of the maximum ramp rate value, hence there is no requirement for the participant to report on the limitation in the ramp rate value. 9.4. Minimum Safe Operating Level (a) As generating units approach the lowest output they can sustain without becoming unstable, a rebid may need to be submitted to ensure that the unit does not receive an even lower Dispatch Target. This is required to ensure safe operation of the plant. (b) For clarity, the minimum safe operating level is assumed to be the level below which the generating unit would become unstable, after other technical responses have been exhausted (for example, auxiliary firing). The minimum safe operating level does not reflect commercial issues, only technical and plant safety issues. Plant availability reflecting commercial considerations should still be managed through the normal price-band bidding dispatch process. (c) In instances where a scheduled generating unit or semi-scheduled generating unit has reached its minimum safe operating level and cannot safely follow a dispatch instruction to DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 33 of 62 vary its output downwards, it is appropriate for a zero down ramp rate to be provided to AEMO, as long as the zero ramp rate can be justified on the basis of a technical limitation. This approach should be used in preference to submitting an inflexible bid, as it provides greater flexibility to ensure the market remains in a secure operating state. (d) As soon as the output of the generating unit moves materially above the minimum safe operating level, a rebid must be submitted to provide a ramp rate compliant with clause 3.8.3A of the NER. (e) The complete “Rebidding and Technical Parameters Guideline” can be found on the AER website. 10. DISPATCH OF GENERATION UNDER NETWORK SUPPORT AGREEMENTS NER clause 5.3A.12(b) provides that where a NSP decides to use generation to provide a network support function, the NSP must advise AEMO of any network support agreements entered into. To ensure that a generating unit that is the subject of a network support agreement is dispatched at the agreed level AEMO will constrain the generating unit on and as such the generating unit will not be eligible to set spot prices when constrained on in accordance with clause 3.9.7 of the NER. The constraint will normally take the form: • GenID >=X MW (where X is the megawatt amount subject to the network support agreement) and will have a constraint violation penalty (CVP) of 30. 11. OUTAGES AND WORK ON MARKET RELATED SCADA 11.1. Impact on Market Processes Failed, suspect or incorrect SCADA has the potential to adversely affect Dispatch Targets, constraint outcomes and AEMO’s power system security monitoring applications. Market Participants and NSPs must advise AEMO in advance of any work that has the potential to affect market processes via SCADA values supplied to AEMO. This may include, but is not limited to SCADA equipment, RTU outages or injection testing. Market Participants and NSPs must report any SCADA failures to AEMO as a matter of urgency. When AEMO becomes aware of suspect or failed SCADA, AEMO will take appropriate action to ensure the integrity of the market processes and its security monitoring applications. This may involve using alternate data sources or replacing failed or suspect values with estimated or hand dressed values. 12. MANDATORY RESTRICTIONS Mandatory restrictions may be imposed by a participating jurisdiction under a relevant law, other than the rules, on the use of electricity in a region. A participating jurisdiction may apply mandatory restrictions when supply scarcities are predicted, to achieve desired levels of load reduction while minimising overall impact to customers by avoiding or reducing involuntary load shedding. The central dispatch process is not directly altered by a jurisdictional exercise of mandatory restrictions. AEMO may consider adjustment of demand forecasts. 13. SCHEDULING ERROR AND PROCESS REVIEW (a) A scheduling error is one of the circumstances described in clause 3.8.24 of the NER, which include a declaration by AEMO that it failed to follow the central dispatch process as set out in clause 3.8 of the NER. (b) Where AEMO or a Registered Participant identified a potential scheduling error, AEMO will investigate and determine whether it has failed to follow the central dispatch instruction. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 34 of 62 (c) If as a result of the process review AEMO identifies that it has failed to follow the central dispatch process set out in NER clause 3.8, AEMO will declare that a scheduling error has occurred and publish a summary of the error on AEMO’s website. (d) A dispute resolution panel may also determine a scheduling error as set out in clause 3.8.24 of the NER. 14. SETTING MPC OVERRIDE 14.1. Load shed under instruction from AEMO If AEMO reasonably believes that the central dispatch process would determine that there would be insufficient supply options to meet all the demand in a region, and issues an instruction to load shed in that region, then from the time that the AEMO instruction is to apply AEMO will set the spot price to MPC for that region. Note 1 If the dispatch algorithm has already set the spot price then that price must remain. 14.2. Resetting of MPC Override The MPC override spot price for a region must be removed when clearance is given to restore the final block of shed load in that region. 15. ADMINISTERED PRICE PERIODS An administered price period is determined to apply separately for each region. 15.1. Triggers for an Administered Price Period Under clause 3.14.2(c) of the NER, an administered price period for a region is triggered if: (a) The sum of the uncapped spot prices or ancillary service prices for that region over the previous 2016 trading intervals (7 days) exceeds the cumulative price threshold; or (b) Refer 15.2. 15.2. Current Trading Day Once an administered price period is declared for a region, the remaining trading intervals for that trading day will also be administered price periods. 15.3. Dispatch during Administered Price Period During administered price periods AEMO will continue dispatching generation and loads in accordance with the central dispatch process. 15.4. Administered Price Cap & Cumulative Price Threshold The administered price cap (APC) sets the maximum price, and the administered floor price (AFP) sets the minimum price that can apply while an administered price period is in place. Note 2 The AFP does not apply to ancillary service prices, those prices are limited by the $0 offer restriction. The latest cumulative price threshold can be found on the AEMC website. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 35 of 62 15.5. Pricing during Administered Price Periods 15.5.1. Triggered by Spot Prices exceeding CPT If the sum of the uncapped spot prices in a region has triggered an administered price period, then from the next trading interval: (a) If the spot price exceeds the APC, then AEMO must set the spot price to the APC. (b) If the spot price is less than the administered floor price, AEMO must set the spot price to the administered floor price. (c) If an ancillary service price for any market ancillary services in that region exceeds the APC, AEMO will set that ancillary service price to the APC. 15.5.2. Triggered by Ancillary Service Prices exceeding CPT If the sum of the uncapped ancillary service prices for a market ancillary service in a region has triggered an administered price period, then from the next trading interval: (a) If an ancillary service price for any market ancillary service in that region exceeds the APC, AEMO will set that ancillary service price to the APC. 16. MANIFESTLY INCORRECT INPUTS (MII) AND PRICE REVIEW 16.1. Trading intervals that are subject to review (clause 3.9.2B (b), (c)) (a) AEMO has developed an automated method of monitoring and identifying trading intervals that are subject to review. Refer to Appendix B for the details of this method and the trigger thresholds used. The dispatch outputs associated with all the regions are independently monitored for this purpose. (b) A Price Status flag of “Not Firm” is published to indicate trading intervals for which all the prices associated with those trading intervals are subject to review, pending the identification of manifestly incorrect inputs. A Price_Status flag of “Firm” is published for all other trading intervals. (Note that the Price_Status flag may not be set to “Not Firm” for trading intervals affected by MII/s where there are violated prices (MPC) that were not resolved by the automatic over-constrained dispatch (OCD) process.) 16.2. Manifestly Incorrect Inputs and revision of prices (a) Whenever a trading interval is identified as subject to review, AEMO control room staff will check whether the inputs used in that trading interval contained a MII. The inputs to dispatch mean any value used by NEMDE including: (i) SCADA measurements of power system (ii) Five-minute demand forecast values (iii) Constraint equations entered by AEMO (iv) Software setup (b) If AEMO determines that the trading interval in question was affected by a MII, all the published prices for the “affected” trading intervals will be rejected (energy and all FCAS prices, for all regions) and will be replaced using the corresponding prices of the last correct trading interval. The last correct trading interval is the previous trading interval that was not affected by a MII (that is, preceding the “affected” trading interval). DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 36 of 62 (c) After the original publication of prices for a trading interval identified as subject to review, there is a time limit of 30 minutes within which AEMO can subsequently reject those prices and automatically replace them with the corresponding set of prices from the last correct trading interval. (d) Once AEMO has followed the price revision process for the trading interval identified as subject to review the Price_Status flag for that trading interval will change to “Firm”. If 30 minutes has expired since the publication of prices for the trading interval identified as subject to review and AEMO have not taken any action to either reject or accept prices for that trading interval, then the prices for that and all subsequent trading intervals will automatically be accepted and their Price_Status flags will change to “Firm”. 16.3. Trading intervals following a trading interval identified as subject to review (a) Whenever a trading interval is identified as subject to review, the trading interval immediately following that interval may also be identified as being subject to review if AEMO considers that it is likely to be subject to that same MII (clause 3.9.2B(c) of the NER). (b) AEMO’s automatic “subject to review” monitoring system is such that whenever a trading interval is identified as subject to review, the Price Status of the following trading interval(s) will continue to be automatically flagged internally to AEMO as either subject to review or indeterminate (externally, these are flagged as “Not Firm”) until AEMO rejects and/or accepts all the preceding subject to review or indeterminate (“Not Firm”) trading intervals. Since there is a time limit of 30 minutes for the price revision of the first interval identified as subject to review, potentially there could be up to five trading intervals with Price_Status flag “Not Firm” following the first trading interval until AEMO completes the price review process. 16.4. Trading intervals identified as subject to review that had a successful Over-constrained Dispatch (OCD) re-run Where an automatic OCD re-run has occurred for a trading interval identified as \"subject to review\", AEMO will review that trading interval for the presence of a MII and, if found, the prices will be rejected and then automatically replaced using the corresponding prices from the last correct trading interval. 16.5. Trading intervals identified as subject to review following a trading interval that had an unsuccessful Over-constrained Dispatch (OCD) re- run If an MII is found, AEMO will reject and automatically replace prices of the trading interval identified as subject to review with the prices from the last correct interval. The last correct trading interval could be an interval that had an unsuccessful OCD re-run (refer section 5.1). The prices of the original interval with an unsuccessful OCD re-run, as well as the following rejected trading interval (which inherits the prices from the previous interval) would now both be subject to manual review. Market Notices would be issued covering both trading intervals and the price revision process will be followed as shown in section 5.1. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 37 of 62 17. NEGATIVE SETTLEMENTS RESIDUES 17.1. General Approach (a) If the accumulation of negative settlements residues over the period of counter-price flows is forecast to reach the threshold value of $100 000 then AEMO would use reasonable endeavours to apply constraints to the affected directional interconnector to prevent the accumulation exceeding the threshold, provided system security can be maintained. (b) These constraints would remain in place until, in AEMO’s reasonable opinion, the constraints could be revoked without creating counter-price flows. (c) AEMO will treat each occurrence individually and the billing period accumulation will not be used to offset the trigger. (I.e., will not use the amount of positive residue accumulated during the billing period to offset the trigger). (d) If negative settlements residues began to occur due to a binding fully co-optimised constraint in dispatch at a material rate but had not been forecast in pre-dispatch then AEMO would take action to halt the further accumulation of negative settlements residues when the total negative settlements residues was estimated to have accumulated to $100,000. In order to ensure a response within a 30-minute period such estimates of negative settlements residues accumulation will be made on the basis of trading interval quantities. 17.2. Constraints in Dispatch To halt further accumulation of negative settlements residues AEMO will constrain the directional interconnector flow (“interconnector capping”) at a rate no greater than that which applies for a planned outage. This would cease at the point at which counter price flows were halted. From that point on periodic adjustment of the level of the constraint might be necessary due to changing market conditions by: (a) Increasing the level of constraint if counter-price flows re-emerged OR (b) Relaxing the level of constraint if significant positive inter-regional settlements accumulations indicated that current level of constraint was excessive. 17.3. Market reporting of negative settlements residue management AEMO will issue Market Notices, providing details of the actions taken to manage negative settlements residues containing the following information: (a) The directional interconnector (b) The actual or forecast times of the event (c) Any constraints invoked to manage the event 18. REQUESTS FOR CLARIFICATION OF MARKET REPORTS OR FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (a) AEMO will ensure that confidential information is not inadvertently provided to Market Participants and that any information designated as public information is equitably provided to all Market Participants at the same time. To achieve this, the following policy is adopted: (i) All requests for further information about specific market notices should be to the AEMO Information and Support Hub. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 38 of 62 (ii) At times when the Information and Support Hub is not staffed then all enquiries from energy traders will be handled by the control centres. (b) The response will depend on the nature of the enquiry as follows: (i) If the enquiry involves a confidential matter for that energy trader then the question will be directly answered. (ii) If the enquiry involves a request for additional public information then the enquiry will not be directly answered instead a response may be sent out in the form of an AEMO Communication or market notice so that the information is available to all Market Participants at the same time. (iii) If the enquiry involves confidential information to which that energy trader is not entitled, then a response will not be provided. 19. GENERIC CONSTRAINT APPLICATION OPTIONS IN MMS There are a number of options available to AEMO control room staff when generic constraints are to be invoked in the MMS. The options include the use of: (a) Predefined constraint sets prepared for system normal conditions (b) Predefined constraint sets prepared for routine transmission network outages (c) Blocking constraint equations (d) Predefined discretionary constraint sets (e) Quick constraints (f) Constraint sets and/or equations built by control room staff as a need arises (g) Constraint Automation created constraint sets and equations prepared for any network condition Depending on the circumstances at the time, one or a number of these types of generic constraint will be invoked in the MMS. These are briefly described in this section. 19.1. System Normal and Network Outage Constraints (a) A system security issue may arise at any time under system normal conditions, network outage conditions or following the occurrence of a contingency event. Generally, if predefined generic constraints are available for a system normal or network outage condition then they will be invoked in the MMS. (b) In the case of a contingency event, one of the many tasks undertaken would be to determine if network equipment was going to be returned to service in a very short time. If not then depending on requirements, a network outage constraint set may be invoked provided an appropriate associated generic constraint is available. Generic constraints of this nature are prepared on the basis of accommodating a network outage while maintaining the network in a secure operating state. 19.2. Blocking Constraint Equations If a constraint equation, which is part of an invoked constraint set, is malfunctioning, AEMO can ‘block’ that constraint equation without removing it from the constraint set. ‘Blocking’ a constraint equation removes it from dispatch, pre-dispatch and 5 min pre-dispatch calculations. Blocking is linked to the constraint equation name, not the constraint set. So, if any other constraint set DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 39 of 62 containing the blocked equation is invoked, the equation will remain blocked. Blocking will also remain in place if a constraint equation is reviewed and the constraint equation name does not change. AEMO may replace the blocked constraint equation with a discretionary or quick constraint. AEMO can ‘Unblock’ the constraint equation when it considers appropriate. Refer to section 8 for more details about when AEMO may block a constraint equation. 19.3. Discretionary and Quick Constraints (a) There is a predefined series of constraints referred to as discretionary constraints. These are generally simple format constraints with either a generating unit, a collection of generating units, or an interconnector term on the LHS. There are no dynamic RHS components, only a static RHS. These are for use at the discretion of AEMO control room staff to meet any requirement that results in the need to limit power flow on major network components. Discretionary constraints may be used with routine planned network outages where a constant limit on power flow is required. They may also be used as a post-contingent response to reduce or limit network power flow or at any time that a system security issue arises and control of power flow on a single network element is required. (b) The AEMO MMS has constraint type labelled as a quick constraint. The quick constraint is simply a constraint which acts on a selected LHS with a user defined RHS value. The selected LHS may be: (i) A single generating unit or interconnector. (ii) Multiple generating units or interconnectors. (iii) FCAS for any combination of selected regions or for a single ancillary service unit. (c) The label “quick constraint” is a reflection of the method of application. A quick constraint may be invoked in a short time compared to other constraints that may take a number of minutes to search for, verify and apply. Note 3 All quick constraints are prefixed with a # symbol for ease of identification. 19.4. Generic Constraints Built as Required by Control Room Staff The case may arise where power system security is an issue and there is not a suitable network outage constraint, discretionary constraint or quick constraint available. In such circumstances control room staff may develop constraint equations or constraint sets as required to maintain system security. Note 4 The ID of all constraint equations and constraint sets built by control room staff are prefixed with an @ symbol for ease of identification. 19.5. Constraint Automation Constraint Automation is an EMS based application that allows AEMO staff to generate thermal constraints based on an EMS study case. This system is used to create constraints for system conditions where constraints don’t already exist, or existing constraints are not operating correctly. Constraint Automation generates constraints based on violations in the EMS Contingency Analysis; these are then packaged together into a single constraint set and loaded into the MMS where they can be invoked like any other constraint set. Constraints generated by this system are uniquely identified. Constraint Sets have IDs which start with CA_xxx_ and are followed by a unique DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 40 of 62 identifier. Constraint Equations use the same ID suffixed by a number for each constraint in the series (01, 02 etc.) e.g., Constraint Set: CA_MQS_36661FF1 Constraint Equation: CA_MQS_36661FF1_01 19.6. Network Constraint Ramping (a) The Network Constraint Ramping Tool (part of the SOMMS application) allows the creation of ramping constraints for any planned outage constraint irrespective of whether the LHS of the constraint includes interconnectors and/or generators. This ramping system includes the following features: (i) The process will source the data for an outage from 30 minute Pre-dispatch forecasts and ramp the RHS of all constraint equations associated with the outage gradually to values forecast to apply when the outage commences. (ii) The process will utilise two forms of ramping for each constraint in the outage set thus creating double the number of constraints than in the outage set: (A) Soft ramping towards the final outage level, to minimise transient dispatch pricing disturbances that would otherwise occur without ramping. The soft constraint will complete ramping two trading intervals prior to the completion of hard constraint ramping. (B) Hard ramping at slower rate than soft ramping, to ensure that the outage is ready to proceed within a certain maximum time regardless of dispatch pricing outcomes. (b) The soft constraint and hard constraint will have the same constraint equation formulation, but the soft constraint will ramp faster than the hard constraint because the soft constraint has fewer trading intervals to ramp than the hard constraints. Consequently, the soft constraint has a small value of generic constraint weight which is typically less than MPC. The constraint violation penalty (CVP) of the soft constraint will be determined by the marginal value of its outage constraint equation in pre-dispatch, while the CVP for hard constraints will be set as the same as a normal network constraint. (c) The timing in which the ramping process should be invoked and revoked is determined by the number of trading intervals required for the ramp, plus an allowance for a safety margin. During the ramping constraint set creation and invocation process, the final outage level will be obtained from the pre-dispatch forecast for the outage constraint equations’ RHS. Note 5 If an outage constraint equation was not binding in pre-dispatch, the ramping constraint equation will still use the RHS value for its formulation. Consequently, all the constraint equations in the outage constraint set will be ramped in dispatch even though not all of them were binding during pre-dispatch. (d) The ramping process can be applied to any constraint sets related to the planned network outage, especially fully co-optimised constraints which contain a mixture of interconnector and generator terms on the LHS. The ramping process should be used for all planned outage constraints where ramping is required, irrespective of whether an interconnector is involved or not. (e) The ramping process would not apply to FCAS constraint sets or any network outage constraint sets that have FCAS terms in their LHS. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 41 of 62 (f) The process is required to ramp all the constraints that are included in the invoked outage constraint set regardless of whether all the constraints were binding in Pre-dispatch. Note 6 If there is not at least one Pre-dispatch interval in which the network outage constraint has been invoked, the process will be prevented from being enabled. (g) The ramping constraint sets, and constraints will be named as follows (i) Constraint Set: #R<RAMP_SEQ>_RAMP (ii) Soft Constraint: #R<RAMP_SEQ>_nnn_RAMP_V (iii) Hard Constraint: #R<RAMP_SEQ>_nnn_RAMP_F (iv) Where the <RAMP_SEQ> is a six digit unique number. (h) Constraint ramping will not be used for situations where AEMO reclassifies a non-credible contingency event as a credible contingency event. 20. AEMO CONSTRAINT EQUATION PERFORMANCE Binding constraint equations are simply a result of the network being operated at or near a design limit. These are generally a normal market outcome. However, there is always the possibility of a constraint equation not performing as expected. This may result in either limits falling short of system security requirements or in limits being more restrictive or conservative. The latter can result in the market being constrained with available generation capacity being restricted unnecessarily. The process for reviewing non-performing constraint equations is progressed as soon as possible and in any case within 30 mins of the problem occurring. In general, participants should contact AEMO immediately if they suspect that a constraint equation is not performing as expected. This action should assist the participant by providing an understanding of the situation at that time. This section outlines the steps that may be taken in response to a non-performing constraint equation. 20.1. AEMO Action for Under Conservative Constraint Equations This is the situation where a constraint equation should be binding but is failing to set appropriate power system limits. Actions taken by AEMO under such conditions may include: (a) Confirm power system security violations evident from network analysis tools. (b) Assess alternative network configuration to remove the security violation. (c) Use the Constraint Automation tool to create a new constraint for the system condition. Note: Thermal constraints only. (d) Invoke appropriate network generic constraints to restore the power system to a secure operating state. (e) Request constraint builders to tune or replace the inadequate constraint equation. 20.2. AEMO Action for Over Conservative Constraint Equations • Establish that a constraint equation is binding by observing a non-zero marginal value for the equation. • Determine the purpose of the constraint equation and ensure it is required at that time. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 42 of 62 • Based on network study results, estimate the constraint equation result that should be reasonably expected at that time. • Compare the expected result to the binding constraint equation result. • Depending on the significance of any discrepancy, appropriate actions may be : • Minor discrepancies: Continue to monitor. • Block the constraint equation or remove it from the set or revoke the constraint set from MMS. • Apply discretionary network constraints to manage power system security. If a thermal constraint, replace using the constraint automation tool. • During business hours: Arrange for tuning or replacement of the binding constraint equation. Until the constraints have been revised, the power system will be managed by Constraint Automation and/or discretionary constraints as appropriate. In situations where an over conservative constraint problem exists control room staff will not revoke constraints associated with Transient stability, Steady State Stability or Voltage Stability. The control room does not have sufficient analysis facilities to establish acceptable levels to extend these types of limits. 20.3. AEMO Action for Binding Constraints (a) Under clause 3.8.1(a) of the NER, in operating the central dispatch process AEMO is to use its reasonable endeavours to maintain power system security in accordance with Chapter 4 and to maximise the value of spot market trading on the basis of dispatch offers and dispatch bids. (b) When a constraint binds in dispatch, AEMO will, to the extent that is reasonably possible, review the constraint to assess the validity and accuracy of the constraint outcome and use reasonable endeavours to determine if there are actions AEMO can initiate to relieve the network congestion. (c) These actions may include utilising the full extent of the thermal ratings of transmission elements as specified by the Network Service Provider (NSP) in accordance with the Rules, clause 4.6.4. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 43 of 62 APPENDIX A. NON-CONFORMANCE CALCULATIONS AND PROCESS OVERVIEW A.1 Overview AEMO operates Conformance Monitoring software (Compmon3) to assist with the management of the non-conformance process. Compmon operates continuously in AEMO control rooms. Conformance calculations are initiated immediately following each dispatch calculation. Each conformance calculation is relevant to the previous trading interval but calculated at a time when both the Dispatch Targets for that trading interval and the final actual megawatt values for that trading interval are known. The conformance calculation covers the following4: • Scheduled generating units • Semi-scheduled generating units • Scheduled loads • Aggregates The following abbreviations are used in this Appendix: • MW = Actual Generation/Consumption. • MWB = Dispatch Target (also referred to as dispatch level for semi-scheduled generating units. • MWO = Bid Unit Availability; UIGF for semi-scheduled generating units. • ROC = Rate of Change or Ramp Rate. • FCR = FCAS Raise Regulation enabled. • FCL = FCAS Lower Regulation enabled. A.2 Conformance Calculations Detection of non-conformance is based on two error thresholds. The Small Error Trigger and the Large Error Trigger are calculated in Compmon. For a scheduled resource, either not in an Aggregate or in an Aggregate and with individual dispatch conformance required, the individual Small and Large Error Trigger thresholds are calculated as follows: Small Error Trigger threshold: Trigger level (MW) is: MAX ( 6, MIN [ 3% MWO, 2*ROC ]) Large Error Trigger threshold: Trigger level (MW) is: MAX ( 6, MIN [ 5% MWO, 4*ROC ]) ROC calculation5: If Dispatch Target > Actual MW then: ROC = min (SCADA Ramp Up rate, bid Ramp Up rate) 3 Also referred to in this procedure as the AEMO Conformance Module 4 Under some circumstances, some scheduled resources or classes of scheduled resources may be suspended from non- conformance monitoring. 5 Note that the ROC calculation uses the Dispatch Target from the latest trading interval. Actual MW is at the start of that trading interval. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 44 of 62 Else if Dispatch Target < Actual MW then: ROC = min (SCADA Ramp Down rate, bid Ramp Down rate) Else (Dispatch Target = Actual MW) ROC = Min [ min (SCADA Ramp Up rate, bid Ramp Up rate), min (SCADA Ramp Down rate, bid Ramp Down rate) ] For an Aggregate, dispatch conformance is monitored: • in aggregate across all scheduled resources, against an aggregate Small Error Trigger and aggregate Large Error Trigger (see calculations below), but only if aggregated dispatch conformance is required on any of the scheduled resources in the Aggregate (conformance mode > 0 in their dispatch instructions); and • for an individual scheduled resource against its individual Small Error Trigger and individual Large Error Trigger (see calculations above), but only if individual dispatch conformance is required on the resource (conformance mode = 2 in its dispatch instruction) For an Aggregate, the aggregate Small and Large Error Trigger thresholds are calculated as follows: ROC calculation for Aggregate Error Trigger threshold 6: If Aggregate Dispatch Target > Aggregate Actual MW then: Generating Unit ROC = min (SCADA Ramp Up rate, bid Ramp Up rate) Load ROC = min (SCADA Ramp Down rate, bid Ramp Down rate) Else if Aggregate Dispatch Target < Aggregate Actual MW then: Generating Unit ROC = min (SCADA Ramp Down rate, bid Ramp Down rate) Load ROC = min (SCADA Ramp Up rate, bid Ramp Up rate) Else (Aggregate Dispatch Target = Aggregate Actual MW) 6 Note that the ROC calculation uses the Aggregate Dispatch Target from the latest trading interval. Aggregate Actual MW is at the start of that trading interval. Aggregate Small Error Trigger threshold (MW): MAX ( 6, { MIN [ 3% MAX (Sum of all Generating Unit MWO, Sum of all Load MWO), 2 * MAX (Sum of all Generating Unit ROC, Sum of all Load ROC) ] } ) Aggregate Large Error Trigger threshold (MW): MAX ( 6, { MIN [ 5% MAX (Sum of all Generating Unit MWO, Sum of all Load MWO), 4 * MAX (Sum of all Generating Unit ROC, Sum of all Load ROC) ] } ) DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 45 of 62 Generating Unit/Load ROC = Min [ min (SCADA Ramp Up rate, bid Ramp Up rate), min (SCADA Ramp Down rate, bid Ramp Down rate) ] Note that 6 MW is the minimum Small Error Trigger threshold and 6 MW is the minimum Large Error Trigger threshold. After every dispatch run, the Compmon application compares the difference between the MWB of the previous trading interval and the MW of the current trading interval with the error trigger thresholds. In addition to MWB, a compensation for FCAS is included to allow for regulating plant movement. The Small and Large Error Triggers (including the aggregate Small and Large Error Triggers for an Aggregate) each have an associated counter. For an Aggregate, the aggregate error count and any individual scheduled resource error counts are independent of each other. The counters each increment on detection of error and are used to trigger applicable non-conformance action. For an individual scheduled generating unit or scheduled load 7 For error detection above MWB: • If a Generating Unit and [ MW - (MWB + FCR) ] > Small Error Trigger Threshold or If a Load and [ MW - (MWB + FCL) ] > Small Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Small Error Counter • If a Generating Unit and [ MW – (MWB + FCR) ] > Large Error Trigger Threshold or If a Load and [ MW – (MWB + FCL) ] > Large Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Large Error Counter For error detection below MWB: • If a Generating Unit and [ (MWB – FCL) – MW ] > Small Error Trigger Threshold or If a Load and [ (MWB – FCR) – MW ] > Small Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Small Error Counter • If a Generating Unit and [ (MWB – FCL) – MW ] > Large Error Trigger Threshold or If a Load and [ (MWB – FCR) – MW ] > Large Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Large Error Counter 7 Including any scheduled resource in an Aggregate subject to individual dispatch conformance (conformance mode = 2) DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 46 of 62 For an individual semi-scheduled generating unit 8 For error detection above MWB: • If semi-dispatch cap flag = ‘TRUE’ Then • If [ MW - (MWB + FCR) ] > Small Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Small Error Counter • Else reset the Small Error Counter to zero • If [ MW – (MWB + FCR) ] > Large Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Large Error Counter • Else reset the Large Error Counter to zero • Else (semi-dispatch cap flag = ‘FALSE’) reset the Small and Large Error Counters to zero For an Aggregate that is a Cap Aggregate Aggregate Dispatch Target = SUMall Generating units (MWB) Aggregate Actual MW = SUMall Generating units (MW) For error detection above the aggregate dispatch target: • If conformance mode > 0 for any scheduled resource in the Aggregate Then • If Aggregate Actual MW - Aggregate Dispatch Target - SUMall Generating units (FCR) > Aggregate Small Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Small Error Counter • Else reset the Small Error Counter to zero • If Aggregate Actual MW - Aggregate Dispatch Target - SUMall Generating units (FCR) > Aggregate Large Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Large Error Counter • Else reset the Large Error Counter to zero • Else (conformance mode = 0 for all scheduled resources) reset the Small and Large Error Counters to zero 8 Including any scheduled resource in an Aggregate subject to individual dispatch conformance (conformance mode = 2) DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 47 of 62 For an Aggregate that is a Mixed Aggregate Aggregate Dispatch Target = SUMall Generating units (MWB) - SUMall Loads (MWB) Aggregate Actual MW = SUMall Generating units (MW) - SUMall Loads (MW) Net Scheduled Dispatch Target = SUMall Scheduled Generating units (MWB) – SUMall Loads (MWB) Net Scheduled Actual MW = SUMall Scheduled Generating units (MW) – SUMall Loads (MW) Net Scheduled Small/Large Error Trigger Thresholds: calculated using the Aggregate Small/Large Error Trigger Thresholds formula above, but with semi-scheduled generating units ignored. Aggregate Error Logic IF ANY scheduled resource in the Mixed Aggregate with conformance mode = 1 is not conforming to its individual dispatch target (based on the relevant individual resource’s small error logic described above) THEN ALL scheduled resources in the Mixed Aggregate are deemed to be participating in aggregated dispatch conformance, and the following aggregate error logic applies: For error detection above the aggregate dispatch target: • If Aggregate Actual MW - Aggregate Dispatch Target - SUMall Generating units (FCR) - SUMall Loads (FCR) > Aggregate Small Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Small Error Counter • If Aggregate Actual MW - Aggregate Dispatch Target - SUMall Generating units (FCR) - SUMall Loads (FCR) > Aggregate Large Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Large Error Counter For error detection below the aggregate dispatch target: If Net Scheduled Dispatch Target - Net Scheduled Actual MW - SUMall Scheduled Generating units (FCL) - SUMall Loads (FCL) > Net Scheduled Small Error Trigger Threshold Then • If Aggregate Dispatch Target - Aggregate Actual MW - SUMall Generating units (FCL) - SUMall Loads (FCL) > Aggregate Small Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Small Error Counter • If Net Scheduled Dispatch Target - Net Scheduled Actual MW - SUMall Scheduled Generating units (FCL) – SUMall Loads (FCL) > Net Scheduled Large Error Trigger Threshold Then DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 48 of 62 • If Aggregate Dispatch Target – Aggregate Actual MW - SUMall Generating units (FCL) – SUMall Loads (FCL) > Aggregate Large Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Large Error Counter For an Aggregate that is a Target Aggregate Aggregate Dispatch Target = SUMall Generating units (MWB) - SUMall Loads (MWB) Aggregate Actual MW = SUMall Generating units (MW) - SUMall Loads (MW) For error detection above the aggregate dispatch target: • If Aggregate Actual MW - Aggregate Dispatch Target - SUMall Generating units (FCR) - SUMall Loads (FCR) > Aggregate Small Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Small Error Counter • If Aggregate Actual MW - Aggregate Dispatch Target - SUMall Generating units (FCR) - SUMall Loads (FCR) > Aggregate Large Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Large Error Counter For error detection below the aggregate dispatch target: • If Aggregate Dispatch Target – Aggregate Actual MW - SUMall Generating units (FCL) – SUMall Loads (FCL) > Aggregate Small Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Small Error Counter • If Aggregate Dispatch Target – Aggregate Actual MW - SUMall Generating units (FCL) – SUMall Loads (FCL) > Aggregate Large Error Trigger Threshold • Then increment the Large Error Counter The individual and aggregate Small Error Triggers are measured over 6 consecutive trading intervals and the individual and aggregate Large Error Triggers are measured over 3 consecutive trading intervals. These error counter values will progress the non-conformance action. For individual scheduled generating units and scheduled loads9, or for a Mixed or Target Aggregate, the relevant individual or aggregate error counters are reset to ‘zero’ if no error is apparent or reset to ‘one’ if the direction of error reverses. A.3 Conformance Status Following the conformance calculation, each item of plant (DUID and, if part of an Aggregate, the ADG_ID) is allocated a Conformance Status. An item of plant can only have one conformance Status allocated to it in a trading interval. Possible Conformance Status states and explanations of each are: • Normal: Plant is following Target within Error thresholds. • Off-Target: Plant is not following Target. MW Error exceeds detection thresholds. • Not-Responding: A number of trading intervals have passed and plant is still not following target. (The number of trading intervals depends on the severity of error) • NC-Pending: The non-response has reached a stage where the plant will be declared Non- Conforming. 9 Including any scheduled resource in an Aggregate subject to individual dispatch conformance (conformance mode = 2) DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 49 of 62 • Non-Conforming: The plant is declared Non-Conforming and a Non-Conformance constraint is applied. • Suspended: The plant is not included in the Conformance Process. Conformance Status change for an item of plant may be achieved by: • An automated process based on the error counters. • An AEMO user-initiated action. Additionally, two operating modes exist for Compmon, these are: • Auto, where all Conformance Status changes through to Non-Conforming are based on error counters. Once plant has been declared Non-Conforming a phone communication is required from the participant advising AEMO of the reason for the non-conformance. The participant must advise AEMO when they are capable of following Dispatch Targets, then the non- conformance declaration can be lifted. There is an optional “Verify Non-Conformance Declaration” function available to the AEMO user when operating in this mode. This will hold the process at the NC-Pending Conformance Status until the AEMO user confirms the Non- Conformance Declaration. This option may be applied or not at the AEMO users’ discretion. • Manual, where Conformance Status changes up to the Not-Responding stage only are determined on an automated basis. Any further action to declare plant Non-Conforming is based on AEMO user actions. These actions include initiating phone calls to plant operations staff, Non-Conformance and Conformance Declarations, Constraint application, manual logging and Market Notice publication. In Manual mode, Compmon is used only as an alarm mechanism for AEMO operations staff to take manual action. Possible status changes in Manual and Auto operating modes are illustrated below. Note that the solid lines (arrows) represent a Conformance Status change based on error counters with no AEMO user input. The dotted lines (arrows) represent possible AEMO user-initiated Conformance Status change. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 50 of 62 Figure 9 Status Transition in Manual Mode DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 51 of 62 Figure 10 Status Transition in Auto Mode As can be seen from the illustrations above and the previous descriptions of Conformance Status, plant following target within the error thresholds will have a Conformance Status of Normal. In Manual mode, this will change to Off-Target then to Not-Responding based on error counters. Non-Conformance Declaration by AEMO will then be a manual AEMO user action in this mode. This includes constraint application, logging, market notice issue, and phone conversations with plant control staff regarding the declaration of Non-Conformance. The severity of the Conformance Status indicated by the AEMO Conformance Module will be limited to Not- Responding while the manual action takes place. Note that if plant is manually declared Non- Conforming and a non-conformance constraint is applied then it is likely that the reported Conformance Status will revert to Normal as a result of the constraint action. In Auto mode, the Conformance Status will change to Off-Target, Not-Responding, NC-Pending and Non-Conforming based on error counters. In either mode, the AEMO user may accelerate the process and declare Non-Conformance at any time or Suspend a DUID or ADG_ID from taking part in the Conformance process. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 52 of 62 The criteria for Conformance Status change in Manual and Auto operating modes is presented in the following two tables. In addition to this information, the AEMO user-initiated changes illustrated in the diagrams above are available at the user’s discretion in line with current policy. Table 4 Conformance Status Change in Manual or Auto Modes Previous Status Criteria for Conformance Status Change In Manual or Auto Mode Resulting Status Change Normal Large Error Count ≥ 1 Off-Target Normal Small Error Count ≥ 1 Off-Target Off-Target Large Error Count ≥ 3 Not-Responding Off-Target Small Error Count ≥ 6 Not-Responding Off-Target or Not-Responding Large Error Count = 0 and Small Error Count = 0 Normal Table 5 Conformance Status Change in Auto Mode Previous Status Criteria for Conformance Status Change In Auto Mode Resulting Status Change Not-Responding Large Error Count ≥ 5 NC-Pending Not-Responding Small Error Count ≥ 8 NC-Pending NC-Pending The Status in the next trading interval will be Non- Conforming. Non-Conforming A.4 Information to Participants A Conformance Data Report will be published to participants for their applicable plant following each Conformance Module calculation, once per trading interval. As well as the relevant time information, the report will contain the following information for each DUID and (if the DUID is part of an Aggregate) at the ADG_ID level (where DUID = ADG_ID). Status The status of the particular DUID and (if applicable) ADG_ID following the last conformance module calculation. That is, Normal, Suspended, Off-Target, Not-Responding, NC-Pending, Non- Conforming. Participant Status Action Messages for a DUID An action message is included on the report corresponding to each status as follows: • Normal: No action required. Unit is following dispatch target • Suspended: No action required. Unit is excluded from the conformance process at this time • Off-Target: Please move to dispatch target or rebid • Not-Responding: Please move to dispatch target or rebid • NC-Pending (Possible in Auto mode only): Unit not responding to dispatch target. Non- conformance action pending • Non-Conforming (Possible in Auto mode only): Unit declared non-conforming (NC). NC constraint is invoked. AEMO is requesting a reason for the NC DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 53 of 62 Participant Status Action Messages for an ADG_ID10 An action message is included on the report corresponding to each status as follows: • Normal: No action required • Suspended: No action required at the aggregate level. Units excluded from aggregate conformance monitoring • Off-Target: Please move to aggregate dispatch target or rebid • Not-Responding: Please move to aggregate dispatch target or rebid • NC-Pending (Possible in Auto mode only): Unit(s) not responding to aggregate dispatch target. Non-conformance action pending • Non-Conforming (Possible in Auto mode only): ADG declared non-conforming (NC). ADG NC constraint invoked. AEMO is requesting a reason for the NC Energy values relevant to the specific conformance calculation • MWB: NEMDE Dispatch Target or Dispatch Level for the trading interval. • MW: Actual plant MW at the end of the trading interval. • MW Error: Difference between MWB and MW values with allowance for FCR and FCL. • Max MW Error: Max MW Error (positive or negative) over the period since the Status was last “Normal” or “Suspended” and the small error count was zero. Mode • “Manual” (AEMO is currently operating in Manual mode) • “Auto” (AEMO is currently operating in Auto mode) This Conformance Data Report is expected to be used by plant operating staff during normal operation. Note 7 If AEMO’s Compmon is operating in Manual mode for a particular region, the Conformance Status of NC-Pending and Non-Conforming does not exist for DUIDs and ADG_IDs in that region. As previously discussed, the Declaration of Non-Conformance and Conformance is carried out via phone communication initiated by AEMO. A.5 Worked Examples Individual unit – Large Error Example A hypothetical generating unit A has a bid unit availability of 200 MW and a ramp rate of 2 MW/min. Dispatch Target > Actual MW, hence ramp rate = min (SCADA ramp up rate , bid ramp up rate). The large error trigger is determined as follows: • The term representing 5% of the bid unit availability is 5/100 x 200 = 10 MW. • The term representing 4 x [ramp rate] is 4 x 2 = 8 MW. • The minimum of these two terms (10 MW and 8 MW) is 8 MW. • The minimum allowable error is 6 MW. • The maximum of these two terms (6 MW and 8 MW) is 8 MW. 10 In the Conformance Data Report, aggregated dispatch conformance data appears in records where the DUID = ADG_ID DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 54 of 62 • Therefore, the large error trigger is 8 MW. This means that if the generation or load of the plant differs from its Dispatch Target by more than 8 MW then the Conformance Status will be Off-Target. If this occurs for 3 consecutive trading intervals, then the Conformance Status will be Not-Responding. If this occurs for five consecutive trading intervals then the Conformance Status will be NC-Pending (only if in Auto mode). The result for the following trading interval will be Non-Conforming (only if in Auto mode). Individual unit – Small Error Example The small error trigger is determined as follows: • The term representing 3% of the bid unit availability is 3/100 x 200 = 6 MW. • The term representing 2 x [ramp rate] is 2 x 2 = 4 MW. • The minimum of these two terms (6 MW and 4 MW) is 4 MW. • The minimum allowable error is 6 MW. • The maximum of these two terms (6 MW and 4 MW) is 6 MW. • Therefore, the small error trigger is 6 MW. This means that if the generation or load of the plant differs from its Dispatch Target by more than 6 MW then the Conformance Status will be Off-Target. If this occurs for 6 consecutive trading intervals then the Conformance Status will be Not-Responding. If this occurs for 8 consecutive trading intervals then the Conformance Status will be NC-Pending (only if in Auto mode). The result for the following trading interval will be Non-Conforming (only if in Auto mode). Cap Aggregate - Large Error Example A hypothetical Cap Aggregate comprising: • Unit A: wind semi-scheduled generating unit • availability of 100 MW • ramp up rate of 2 MW/min • ramp down rate of 1 MW/min • semi-dispatch cap flag is set (TRUE) • Unit B: solar semi-scheduled generating unit • availability of 200 MW • ramp up rate of 3 MW/min • ramp down rate of 2 MW/min • semi-dispatch cap flag is reset (FALSE) For this trading interval assume: • Aggregate Dispatch Target < Aggregate Actual MW o ROC: use ramp down rate for generating units Because at least one of the semi-scheduled generating units has its semi-dispatch cap flag set then all semi-scheduled generating units will have their aggregated dispatch conformance flag set (conformance mode = 1 in their dispatch instruction) The aggregate large error trigger is determined as follows: Unit A + Unit B: DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 55 of 62 • 5% availability = 0.05 x (100+200) = 15 MW • 4 x SUM[ramp down rate] = 4 x (1+2) = 4 x 3 = 12 MW • Unit A + Unit B aggregate trigger term = minimum of above terms (15 MW and 12 MW) = 12 MW Aggregate large error trigger: = MAX(minimum large allowable error, Unit A + Unit B aggregate trigger term) = MAX(6 MW, 12 MW) = 12 MW This means that if the aggregate generation of the Cap Aggregate exceeds its Aggregate Dispatch Target by more than 12 MW, then the Conformance Status for the ADG_ID will be Off-Target. If this occurs for three consecutive trading intervals, then the Conformance Status will be Not- Responding. If this occurs for five consecutive trading intervals, then the Conformance Status will be NC- Pending (only if in Auto mode). The Conformance Status for the following trading interval will be Non-Conforming (only if in Auto mode). Mixed Aggregate – Large Error Example A hypothetical Mixed Aggregate comprising: • Unit A: solar semi-scheduled generating unit • availability of 100 MW • ramp up rate of 1 MW/min • ramp down rate of 2 MW/min • semi-dispatch cap flag is set (TRUE) • Unit B: battery scheduled generating unit • bid availability of 200 MW • ramp up rate of 2 MW/min • ramp down rate of 3 MW/min • Unit C: battery scheduled load • bid availability of 200 MW • ramp up rate of 2 MW/min • ramp down rate of 4 MW/min For this trading interval assume: • Aggregate Dispatch Target > Aggregate Actual MW o ROC: use ramp up rate for generating units and ramp down rate for loads • All units have their aggregated dispatch conformance flag set (conformance mode = 1 in their dispatch instruction) • Participant is opting into aggregated dispatch conformance because the semi-scheduled generating unit active power is exceeding its dispatch target by more than its small error trigger threshold Net Scheduled Large Error Trigger Threshold (MW) = DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 56 of 62 MAX ( 6, { MIN [ 5% MAX (Sum of Scheduled Generating Unit MWO, Sum of Load MWO), 4 * MAX (Sum of Scheduled Generating Unit ROC, Sum of Load ROC) ] } ) = MAX ( 6, { MIN [ 5% of 200 MW, 4 * 4 MW/min ] } ) = 10 MW The aggregate large error trigger (MW) = MAX ( 6, { MIN [ 5% MAX (Sum of Generating Unit MWO, Sum of Load MWO), 4 * MAX (Sum of Generating Unit ROC, Sum of Load ROC) ] } ) The aggregate large error trigger is determined as follows: 1) Sum of all Generating Unit MWO = (100 + 200) = 300 MW 2) Sum of all Load MWO = 200 MW 3) Sum of Generating Unit ROC = (1 + 2) = 3 MW/min 4) Sum of Load ROC = 4 MW/min 5) 5% MAX(Eq 1, Eq 2) = 0.05 x MAX(300, 200) = 0.05 x 300 = 15 MW 6) 4 x MAX(Eq 3, Eq 4) = 4 x MAX(3,4) = 4 x 4 = 16 MW 7) MAX(6, MIN(Eq 5,Eq 6)) = MAX(6, MIN(15,16)) = MAX(6,15) = 15 MW The aggregate large error trigger (Eq 7) = 15 MW This means that if the Aggregate Actual MW of the aggregate differs from its Aggregate Dispatch Target by more than 15 MW, then the Conformance Status for the Aggregate will be Off-Target. If this occurs for three consecutive trading intervals, then the Conformance Status will be Not- Responding. If this occurs for five consecutive trading intervals, then the Conformance Status will be NC- Pending (only if in Auto mode). The Conformance Status for the following trading interval will be Non-Conforming (only if in Auto mode). Mixed Aggregate – Large Error Example – with individual and aggregated dispatch conformance A hypothetical Mixed Aggregate comprising the same units as in the previous example (i.e. Mixed Aggregate – Large Error Example). For this trading interval assume: • Aggregate Dispatch Target > Aggregate Actual MW o ROC: use ramp up rate for generating units and ramp down rate for loads • Unit A has the individual dispatch conformance flag set (conformance mode = 2 in its dispatch instruction) and units B and C have the aggregated dispatch conformance flag set (conformance mode = 1 in their dispatch instructions) • Unit A Dispatch Target < Unit A Actual MW o ROC: use ramp down rate for generating unit For the Aggregate, dispatch conformance is monitored across all scheduled resources in the Aggregate. Hence the aggregate large error trigger calculation remains the same as the previous example. • The aggregate large error trigger = 15 MW DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 57 of 62 In addition, Unit A is monitored and assessed for its individual dispatch conformance against its individual unit error trigger of 5 MW, calculated as follows: • 5% availability = 0.05 x 100 = 5 MW • 4 x ramp down rate = 4 x 2 = 8 MW • Minimum of above terms (5 MW and 8 MW) = 5 MW Target Aggregate – Large Error Example A hypothetical Target Aggregate comprising: • Unit A: battery scheduled generating unit • bid availability of 200 MW • ramp up rate of 2 MW/min • ramp down rate of 3 MW/min • Unit B: battery scheduled load • bid availability of 200 MW • ramp up rate of 2 MW/min • ramp down rate of 4 MW/min For this trading interval assume: • Aggregate Dispatch Target > Aggregate Actual MW o ROC: use ramp up rate for generating units and ramp down rate for loads • Unit A has 10 MW of FCAS Lower Regulation enabled (FCL) By default: • All units have their aggregated dispatch conformance flag set (conformance mode = 1 in their dispatch instruction) • Aggregated dispatch conformance is applied – no individual dispatch conformance Aggregate Large Error Trigger Threshold (MW) = MAX ( 6, { MIN [ 5% MAX (Generating Unit MWO, Load MWO), 4 * MAX (Generating Unit ROC, Load ROC) ] } ) = MAX ( 6, { MIN [ 5% of 200 MW, 4 * 4 MW/min ] } ) = 10 MW Aggregate Large Over-Target Error Threshold = Aggregate Large Error Trigger Threshold + SUMall Generating units (FCR) + SUMall Loads (FCR) = 10 + 0 + 0 = 10 MW Aggregate Large Under-Target Error Threshold = Aggregate Large Error Trigger Threshold + SUMall Generating units (FCL) + SUMall Loads (FCL) = 10 + 10 + 0 = 20 MW This means that if the Aggregate Actual MW of the aggregate is less than its Aggregate Dispatch Target by more than 20 MW, then the Conformance Status for the Aggregate will be Off-Target. If this occurs for three consecutive trading intervals, then the Conformance Status will be Not- Responding. DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 58 of 62 If this occurs for five consecutive trading intervals, then the Conformance Status will be NC- Pending (only if in Auto mode). The Conformance Status for the following trading interval will be Non-Conforming (only if in Auto mode). DISPATCH PROCEDURE Doc Ref: SO_OP_3705 9 August 2023 Page 59 of 62 APPENDIX B.
