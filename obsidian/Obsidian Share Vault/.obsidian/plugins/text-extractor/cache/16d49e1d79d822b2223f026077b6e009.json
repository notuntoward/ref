Exp erts use “ aging models” to rep licate how a battery degrades throughout its lifetime. These models use mathematical eq uations to calculate lifetime characteristics dep ending on how the battery is used. But up on closer insp ection, several different modeling ap p roaches exist. This article comp ares four common aging models to p redict battery lifetime. Battery lifetime is a concern that many p eop le share. Whether it’s a smartp hone, home storage battery, or electric vehicle, there is a nagging worry that the battery will not last as long as exp ected.  The key to getting the most life out of a battery is knowing what is hap p ening within the battery. As soon as we understand the influencing factors and q uantify their imp act on the degradation of the battery, we can find the most suitable countermeasure to aging. This is where the different aging models to p redict battery lifetime come into p lay. Four Common Aging Models to Predict Battery Lifetime \u0000 . Empirical/Data-driven These models are p urely based on emp irical observations using large amounts of data. They aim to find and leverage the strongest correlations between a set of p arameters that characterizes the usage of a battery and its health status. Accordingly, these models are objective in the way they op erate. \u0000 . Semi-empirical These models resemble p urely emp irical aging models but also include some battery exp ertise. For examp le, when characterizing the usage of a battery, a battery exp ert can tell which characteristics knowingly influence battery aging. These p arameters are then extracted from the data and may serve as inp uts to the aging model. Battery exp ertise can also be used to categorize influencing factors and be ap p lied to other relationship s that have been investigated thoroughly. \u0000 . Mechanistic The mechanistic modeling ap p roach goes one level deep er into what is hap p ening within the battery. In addition to estimating high-level Aging models for p redicting battery lifetime LOGIN DEMOBATTERY ANALYTICS SOLUTIONS ABOUT US RESOURCES 7/22/23, 9:17 AM Blog – Mechanistic Modeling in Batteries to Influence Lifetime https://www .accure.net/battery-knowledge/mechanistic-modeling-battery-aging?utm_campaign=Evergreen Newsletter&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=26 … 2 /3 characteristics like residual cap acity, it tracks and p redicts a minimum of three battery internal p arameters: loss of lithium inventory ( LLI) , loss of active material on the negative electrode ( LAMNE) , and loss of active material on the p ositive electrode ( LAMPE) . This adds comp lexity to the model but increases the accuracy when forecasting future degradation. \u0000 . Physical-chemical Physical-chemical aging models go even one step further than mechanistic aging models. This ap p roach aims to model aging mechanisms sep arately using the necessary p hysical-chemical eq uations. Evidently, this model p rovides the deep est look into what is causing the battery to age. But these insights come at the cost of extensive p arametrization efforts. It req uires a large set of p arameters that often dep end on the materials used as well as the cell design. Shortcuts are not always p ractical since an inaccurate p arametrization can easily become a bottleneck for a p hysical-chemical aging model's overall p erformance and accuracy.

None of these ap p roaches is generally sup erior to all the others. So, in order to find the best fit it is imp ortant to evaluate the target use case. We, at ACCURE, make sure we use the right modeling ap p roach under the right conditions. The benefit of the mechanistic model is the comp romise that it rep resents. On the one hand, it p rovides a deep er understanding of what is hap p ening inside the battery while it is aging. While on the other hand, it does not req uire comp lex p arametrization. The mechanistic model is a comp romise. It p rovides accuracy and insights without the comp lexity of a p hysical-chemical aging model. A mechanistic model breaks down aging from cell level to electrode level. It sp ecifies in which ranges the negative and p ositive electrodes are utilized when the cell is op erated. The mechanistic model is also able to imitate any arbitrary combination of loss of lithium inventory ( LLI) , loss of active material on the negative electrode ( LAMNE) , and loss of active material on the p ositive electrode ( LAMPE) . Moreover, it can detect when an electrode is too close to an unsafe op erating range. A p op ular examp le is the detection of thermodynamic lithium p lating on the negative electrode.  Accurate LLI and LAMPE Estimation Using the Mechanistic Modeling LOGIN DEMOBATTERY ANALYTICS SOLUTIONS ABOUT US RESOURCES 7/22/23, 9:17 AM Blog – Mechanistic Modeling in Batteries to Influence Lifetime https://www .accure.net/battery-knowledge/mechanistic-modeling-battery-aging?utm_campaign=Evergreen Newsletter&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=26 … 3 /3 Increase your battery IQ Sign up for the battery knowledge newsletter Work email* name@businessname.com Which application?* Please Select You can unsubscribe at any time.  By submitting you accep t our Privacy Policy. SIGN ME UP Mechanistic modeling is anything but a trivial task. Recently, we collaborated with Matthieu Dubarry ( Ph.D.) and the Hawai'i Natural Energy Institute ( HNEI) to p ush the boundaries of mechanistic modeling. The results of this collaboration can be found in our recent op en-access p ublication. Interestingly, we found that most state-of-the-art mechanistic models are inaccurately modeling the loss of active material on the p ositive electrode.  More imp ortantly, though, we p rop ose the necessary changes to fix this issue.  Through our work with leading battery researchers, ACCURE is help ing the world better understand lithium-ion batteries.  By building better mechanistic models, we will all get a little more life out of our batteries.   Ap p roach with Layered Oxides ABOUT THE AUTHOR Matthias Kuipers Matthias help s customers gain actionable insights into their battery systems.
