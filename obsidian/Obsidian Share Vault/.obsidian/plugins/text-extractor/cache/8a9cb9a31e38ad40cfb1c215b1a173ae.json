INTRODUCTION W IND energy holds a promising answer to the world which is threatened by an energy crisis and other re- lated environmental disasters. To make wind energy a reliable source of energy, efﬁcient and accurate models for monitoring and forecasting of wind power is the need of the hour. Wind power generated from a wind farm chieﬂy depends on the wind speed and direction at 50–100 m from ground level [1]. The conversion of available wind power into actual power varies nonlinearly due to the transfer functions of the electrical generators. The relationship between the wind speed and gen- erated power is depicted by the wind turbine power curve. The wind turbine power curve is essentially comprised of three re- gions, as shown in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst region below a minimum speed threshold known as the cut-in speed has zero output. The second region, which spans until the machine reaches a nominal output power, marks rapid growth until the rated speed Manuscript received March 21, 2012; revised October 18, 2012; accepted February 07, 2013.

Digital Object Identiﬁer 10.1109/TSTE.2013.2247641 , and the third region gives a constant output, until the cutout speed is attained. The cut-in speed is the minimum speed required for power generation and the cut-out speed is the maximum speed beyond which the generated power remains constant. The theoretical power obtained from wind is given by (1) where is the power captured by the rotor of a wind turbine, is the air density, is the radius of the rotor determining its swept area, is the power coefﬁcient, is the blade-pitch angle, is the tip-speed ratio, and is the wind speed [2]. Wind turbine power curves primarily indicate the perfor- mance of turbines. Hence developing accurate models for power curves is a very important area of research. As the wind turbine power curves under normal conditions are made available by the turbine manufacturers, any anomalies can be effectively detected by monitoring them. An accurately modeled power curve can serve as a tool for prediction too. Since wind energy is stochastic in nature, prediction models for forecasting wind power are required. Power curves can be used as a reference for predicting the output power of a turbine if the forecasted wind speed is available. Power curves modeled for many turbines can help in simulation of planned expansions in a power system with wind power [3]. Accurately modeled power curves can also serve as a basis of comparison between the performances of available turbines, helping the customers to make a proper choice based on their requirements. Wind turbine power curve models can be classiﬁed into para- metric and nonparametric models. In [2], the parametric least- squares model and the nonparametric -nearest neighbor model showed greater accuracy than the other models. A parametric power curve which could be used for prediction, control, mon- itoring, and optimization of wind farm performance has also been developed in [4]. The estimation of the wind turbine power curve based on cluster center fuzzy logic modeling has been pre- sented in [5]. It was also suggested that more accurate modeling couldbeobtainedbyincreasingthe number of clusters. Five dif- ferent methods for wind turbine power curve modeling based on statistical tools have been compared in [6]. The best results were obtained when the fuzzy logic tool was used. A probabilistic model to characterize the dynamics of the output power of wind turbine has been discussed in [7]. The output power has been as- sumed to follow a normal distribution with a varying mean and aconstant standard deviation. A critical analysis of the various methods used for modeling of wind turbine power curves like weibull distribution, method of least squares, and cubic spline interpolation have been compared in [8]. 1949-3029/$31.00 © 2013 IEEE This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

This paper has exploited the advantages offered by the modern nontraditional optimization techniques for modeling of wind turbine power curve. The previous works in this area except [2] and [4] have involved only traditional techniques. Solution of parametric expression using traditional techniques of optimization for huge datasets is a very complicated process. The application of nontraditional techniques enhances the accuracy and is very easy to implement. This paper presents the implementation of advanced algo- rithms for modeling of wind turbine power curves. Parametric and nonparametric models of wind turbine power curves have been developed and their accuracy has been compared using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) as performance metrics. Parametric models of the wind turbine power curve have been built using logistic expression and least squares algorithm. The optimum values of the param- eters in the logistic expression have been solved using algo- rithms like genetic algorithm (GA), evolutionary programming (EP), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evo- lution (DE). A linearized segmented model of the power curve has also been developed. Nonparametric models of wind turbine power curve have been developed using neural networks, fuzzy c-means algorithms, and data mining techniques. The models are developed using ﬁve sets of data. The ﬁrst set is statistically generated based on a probabilistic model and the other sets are real-time data. II. POWER CURVE MODELS The wind turbine power curve can be modeled using para- metric and nonparametric methods. In statistics, a parametric model or ﬁnite-dimensional model is a family of distributions that can be described using a ﬁnite number of parameters. These parameters are usually collected together to form a single -di- mensional parameter vector .Incon- trast, nonparametric models are characterized by parameters, which are in inﬁnite-dimensional parameter spaces. The term nonparametric does not mean to imply that these models lack parameters, but that the number and nature of the parameters are ﬂexible and not ﬁxed in advance. Fig. 2. Linearized segmented model. A. Parametric Models Parametric models of a wind turbine power curve are basi- cally built on a set of mathematical expressions. The parameters of these expressions are found using advanced algorithms. 1) Linearized Segmented Model: A linearized segmented model of the power curve is obtained by approximating it to dif- ferent linear sections as shown in Fig. 2 [9]. The piecewise ap- proximation has been carried out using the equation of a straight line (2) where is the output variable, power of the wind turbine, is the input variable, the wind speed, and the parametric vectors are deﬁned by , being the slope of the segment and a constant. 2) Four-Parameter Logistic Expression: The shape of the power curve can be approximated using a logistic expression with four parameters [2]. Fig. 3 shows the logistic curve, whose expression is given by (3) Here is a vector parameter of the logistic ex- pression that determines its shape. In order to ﬁnd out the value of the vector parameter, the mod- eling of the power curve using a four-parameter logistic expres- sion can be deﬁned as an optimization problem as follows: (4) This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Logistic curve. where is the output power estimated through the four parameter logistic expression, is the actual power, is the number of data, and is the index of the data. The following are the constraints: (5) 3) Five-Parameter Logistic Expression: The logistic curve can also be approximated using ﬁve parameters. The applica- tion of the ﬁve-parameter logistic expression has been reported in [10] for biological applications. In this paper, the ﬁve-param- eter logistic expression has been applied for the wind turbine power curve and the performance has been compared with the four-parameter logistic expression. The ﬁve-parameter logistic function is given by (6) where is the parameter vector of the ﬁve-pa- rameter logistic and the range of the parameters are restricted so that and .The ﬁfth parameter controls the degree of asymmetry and models the given data much better than the four-parameter model. The lack-of-ﬁt errors of the four-param- eter logistic model are eliminated by the ﬁve-parameter model. The values of the vector parameter are obtained by deﬁning the modeling of power curve using ﬁve-parameter logistic ex- pression as an optimization problem with the objective func- tion as expressed in (4). The estimated power is calculated by . The following are the constraints: (7) The four and ﬁve parameter logistic expressions are solved using GA, EP, PSO, and DE. B. Nonparametric Models A nonparametric model is the one in which no assumption is made about the functional form of any distribution. A nonpara- metric model of the wind turbine power curve is built on the assumption [2]. In this paper, nonparametric models are developed using neural networks, fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, and data mining algorithms. III. POWER CURVE MODELING TECHNIQUES The different modeling techniques used in this paper for the development of parametric and nonparametric models of wind turbine power curve have been discussed in detail in this section. A. Techniques for Parametric Models Parametric ﬁtting involves the determination of parameters or coefﬁcients for one or more models on to which the data is ﬁtted. 1) Modeling of Power Curve Using Least Squares Method: A linearized segmented model of the power curve has been de- velopedbydividingitinto ﬁve linear segments. The available data is ﬁtted on to each linear segment using the method of least squares. The least squares method minimizes the summed square of residuals, in order to obtain the coefﬁcient estimates. The residual of the th data point is deﬁned as the difference between the actual power output and the ﬁtted response value , and is identiﬁed as the error associated with the data. The summed square of residuals is given by (8) 2) Modeling of Power Curve Using GA: GA is a search tech- nique based on Darwin’s theory of evolution of biological sys- tems [11]. The procedure for logistic function parameter opti- mization using a real-coded GA algorithm is given in the fol- lowing steps: Step 1. Representation of the Population: For a logistic func- tion with parameters, the individual (chromosome) is repre- sented as a vector of length . The complete population with individuals is represented as a matrix as follows: (9) where represents the th indi- vidual and it is one of the solutions to parameter estimation with as the th parameter for the th solution. The population is initialized randomly within the minimum and maximum limits of the parameters of the logistic function. Step 2. Evaluating the Individuals: Each individual is evaluated using the objective function as follows: (10) Step 3. Selection: individuals are selected based on sto- chastic uniform selection to form the competing pool. Step 4. Creation of Offspring (Crossover and Mutation): From the competing pool, offspring are created by applying crossover with the crossover probability and mutation with mutation probability as follows. Crossover: Two parents are selected randomly. Let parent chromosomes and are selected to be crossed and param- eter be a random number chosen from [0, 1]. If ,then the following crossover on and are performed: (11) This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination. 4 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY Mutation: A parent is selected randomly. Let parent chro- mosome be selected to be mutated and parameter be a random number chosen from [0, 1]. If , then the fol- lowing mutation on is performed: (12) where is a constant and is a real vector to produce a small perturbation. Step 5. Termination: A maximum number of iterations is chosen as the stopping criterion. If the stopping criterion is not satisﬁed, the above procedure is repeated from step 2. Other- wise, the best chromosome of the current population is the op- timum parameter set. 3) Modeling of Power Curve Using EP: EP is an opti- mization algorithm based on the mechanics of natural selec- tion—mutation, competition, and evolution [12]. The solution procedure for optimizing the parameters of logistic functions using EP is described below. Step 1. Representation of the Population: The population is represented as in the case of GA. Step 2. Evaluating the Individuals: Each individual is evaluated using the objective function given in (10). Step 3. Creation of Offspring (Mutation): From each indi- vidual (called parent) an offspring is created as follows: (13) where is the normally distributed random number with mean 0 and standard deviation (14) where is the scaling factor. Step 4. Selection: The parents and the offspring constitute the competing pool of size . From the competing pool, individuals are selected as parents of the next generation based on tournament selection. Step 5. Termination: If the maximum number of iterations is not reached, the above procedure is repeated from step 2. Oth- erwise, the best individual of the current population is the op- timum parameter set. 4) Modeling of Power Curve Using PSO: PSO is a global op- timization algorithm for dealing with problems in which a best solution can be represented as a point (particle) in a multidimen- sional space. Particles are accelerated towards those particles within their communication grouping, which have better ﬁtness values [13]. The parameter estimation of four and ﬁve param- eter logistic functions can be optimized by PSO as follows. Step 1. Representation of the Swarm: For a logistic function with parameters, the particle position is represented as a vector of length . The complete swarm with particles is represented as a matrix as follows: (15) where is the position vector of the th particle and it is one of the solutions to parameter estimation. Step 2. Initialization of the Swarm: The swarm is initialized randomly within the minimum and maximum limits of the pa- rameters of the logistic function. The velocities of the particles are initialized to zero (16) Step 3. Evaluating the Particle: Each particle of the swarm is evaluated using the objective function given in (10). Step 4. Initialization of the Best Positions: In the strategy of PSO, the particle’s best position (Pbest) and global best posi- tion (Gbest) are the key factors. The position with minimum is the particle’s best position. Initially the starting positions of particles are taken as their Pbest. The best position out of all Pbest is Gbest. Step 5. Movement of the Particles: The particles in the swarm are accelerated to new positions by adding new velocities to their present positions. The new velocities are calculated as fol- lows: (17) where is the inertia constant; and are acceleration co- efﬁcients; and and are two separately generated random numbers in the range [0, 1]. The positions of the particles are updated using (18) Step 6. Updating the Best Positions: The particles are evalu- ated in the new positions by the objective function. Then Pbest of particles are updated as follows: (19) where is the objective function value of th particle evaluated at the new position. The best position out of all the new Pbests is taken as Gbest. Step 7. Termination: If the maximum number of iterations is not reached, the above procedure is repeated from step 5. Oth- erwise, Gbest is the optimum parameter set. 5) Modeling of Power Curve Using DE: DE, proposed by Storn and Price [14], is a simple yet powerful algorithm for real parameter optimization. DE has many variants with the naming convention is DE/ / / , where DE stands for “differential evo- lution,” represents a string denoting the base vector to be mu- tated, is the number of difference vectors considered for muta- tion of ,and stands for the type of crossover being used (exp: exponential; bin: binomial). To optimize the parameters of the logistic function, a DE/best/1/bin scheme is used in this paper. Step 1. Representation of the Population: The population is represented as in the case of GA. Step 2. Evaluating the Individuals: Each individual of the population is evaluated using the objective function given in (10) Step 3. Mutation: In DE, a parent vector from the current gen- eration is called target vector, a mutant vector obtained through the differential mutation operation is known as donor vector, and ﬁnally an offspring formed by recombining the donor with This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination. LYDIA et al.: ADVANCED ALGORITHMS FOR WIND TURBINE POWER CURVE MODELING 5 the target vector is called trial vector. In DE/best/1/bin, to create the donor vector for each th target vector from the current pop- ulation, two other distinct parameter vectors, say and , are sampled randomly. The indices and are mutually ex- clusive integers randomly chosen from the range .Now the difference of these two vectors is scaled by a scalar number (that typically lies in the interval [0.4, 1]) and the scaled dif- ference is added to the best vector to obtain the donor vector (20) Step 4. Crossover: Crossover is applied to each pair of the target vector and its donor vector to generate a trial vector. The binomial crossover used in this paper is described as follows: (21) where is a random number in the range [0, 1]; is the crossover rate; and is a random integer in the range [1, ]. Step 5. Selection: The population members for next genera- tion are created as follows. (22) Step 6. Termination: If the maximum number of iterations is not reached, the above procedure is repeated from step 2. Oth- erwise, best individual of the current population is the optimum parameter set. B. Techniques for Nonparametric Models The techniques used to develop nonparametric models of wind turbine power curve have been discussed below. These include neural networks (NNs), fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM), and data mining algorithms. 1) Modeling of Power Curve Using NN: The power curve has been modeled using a multilayer feed forward back prop- agation network. According to the back propagation rule, the error to be minimized is (23) 2) Modeling of Power Curve Using FCM: Data clustering is a process of grouping similar data. According to Hammouda [15], a clustering algorithm partitions a data set into several groups such that the similarity within a group is larger than among groups. FCM uses fuzzy partitioning and determines the cluster centers and the membership matrix using the fol- lowing algorithm: Step 1: Initialize the membership matrix with random values between 0 and 1 with the following constraint: (24) Step 2: The fuzzy cluster centers are calculated using the following formula: (25) where (26) where is between 0 and 1; is the cluster center of fuzzy group is the Euclidean distance between the th cluster center and the th data point, and is a weighting component. Step 3: The cost function of FCM is computed as follows: (27) Stop if the cost function is below a certain tolerance value or its improvement over the previous iteration is below a certain threshold. Step 4: Compute a new using(26).Gotostep 2. The variable region of the wind turbine power curve was modeled using ﬁve clusters. The cluster coordinates were deter- mined using the FCM algorithm. For a set of cluster centers, contains the coordinates of the cluster centers of the inputs and contains the coordinates of the cluster centers of the out- puts [6]. The output wind power vector for a particular input wind speed vector of the test set can be calculated using the following expression: (28) where (29) where is a positive constant that represents the radius deﬁning a neighborhood. 3) Modeling of Power Curve Using Data Mining: Data mining refers to extracting or mining knowledge from large amounts of data. Nonparametric modeling of power curve has been done using four data mining algorithms namely bagging, the M5P algorithm, the REPTree algorithm, and M5Rules. The bagging (or bootstrap aggregation) algorithm works in the following manner [16]: Step 1: Given a set of samples, for iteration , a training set is sampled with re- placement from the original set of samples . Step 2: A classiﬁer is learned for each training set . Step 3: To classify an unknown sample , each classiﬁer returns its class prediction, which is counted as one vote. Step 4: The bagged classiﬁer counts the votes and assigns the class with the most votes to . Bagging can be applied to the prediction of continuous values by taking the average value of each classiﬁer prediction. Witten and Frank [17] state that model trees that are used for numeric prediction are just like ordinary decision trees except that at each leaf they store a linear regression model that predicts the class value of the instances that reach the leaf. The initial implementation of the concept of model trees was deﬁned and improved in a system called M5 . M5P is the model tree learner whose algorithm is explained in [18] as follows: This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination. 6 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TABLE I PARAMETERS OF LINEARIZED SEGMENTED MODEL Step 1: M5 constructs a tree by splitting the data to minimize intrasubset variation in the class values of instances down each branch. Step 2: A linear model is computed for each node and then the tree is pruned back from the leaves, as long as the expected estimated error decreases. Step 3: A smoothing procedure is used to compensate for sharp discontinuities that occur between linear models at the leaves of the pruned tree. REPTree is a fast decision tree learner and it builds a decision or regression tree using information gain/variance reduction and prunes it using reduced-error pruning [16]. M5Rules obtains re- gression rules from model trees built using M5 .The M5Rules algorithm works as follows [18]: Step 1: A model tree is applied to the full training dataset and aprunedtreeislearned. Step 2: Thebestleaf is made into aruleand thetree isdis- carded. Step 3: All instances covered by the rule are removed from the dataset. The process is applied recursively to the remaining instances and terminates when all instances are covered by one or more rules. These data mining algorithms bagging, M5PTree, RepTree, and M5Rules are used to model the wind turbine power curve and their performances are compared using suitable metrics. IV. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS A. Experimental Data The modeling of the wind turbine power curve has been car- ried out using ﬁve sets of data. The ﬁrst set of data was generated based on normal distribution with a varying mean and constant standard deviation [7]. The actual wind turbine generator power output , a random variable, can be expressed as (30) The actual wind turbine generator output of the probabilistic model can be obtained using the cubic power model (31) where is the wind speed, is the power curve coefﬁcient, and is a factor that accounts for the con- version rate of total wind power to electrical power, which is usually around 0.5926. The wind turbine power curve is gen- erated using the following data: kW, m/s, TABLE II CONTROL PARAMETERS OF VARIOUS ALGORITHMS m/s, m/s, . The total number of data generated is 1008 with the standard deviation of 0.5 kW. The second set of data is a real-time data obtained from So- tavento Galicia Plc., which is an experimental wind farm sup- ported by the “Xunta de Galicia,” the regional autonomous gov- ernment, with an objective to create a new concept in wind farms.1 A total of 4388 data, the 10-min averaged data of De- cember 2011, has been used. The other three real-time datasets were obtained from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy for the U.S. Department of Energy. The hourly data of October–De- cember 2006 of three different wind farms have been used. A total of 2208 data have been used in the datasets 3, 4, and 5. Nonparametric models were trained using 50% of the datasets and the remaining 50% were used for testing. For implementa- tion of optimization algorithms, the total number of data is con- sidered for all the datasets. B. Results of Different Algorithms Parametric and nonparametric models of wind turbine power curve were developed for both the sets of data, using the mod- eling techniques discussed above and the results were compared using the performance metrics MAE and RMSE. 1) Results of Parametric Models: The parameters of the lin- earized segmented model of the power curve were obtained as given in Table I for all ﬁve datasets. The different segments (Seg) of the power curve were modeled using linear equations in the MATLAB curve ﬁtting tool box. For applying GA, EP, PSO, and DE algorithms, the popula- tion size and the maximum number of iterations are selected as 50 and 100, respectively. The other control parameters of dif- ferent algorithms used in optimizing the logistic expressions are listed in Table II. The parameters of the four parameter logistic function ,obtainedusing GA, EP,PSO,and DE forall ﬁve datasets have been tabulated in Table III. The parameters of the ﬁve parameter logistic functions obtained usingGA, EP,PSO,and DE forall ﬁve datasets have been tab- ulated in Table IV. 1Available: http://www.sotaventogalicia.com/ This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

The error values were calculated after performing 25 iterations. The four TABLE V NN ARCHITECTURE USED FOR POWER CURVE MODELING different data mining algorithms bagging, M5P, REP Tree, and M5Rules were developed in WEKA. The models were trained using the training data and their performances were tested using the test data of the respective datasets. C. Analysis of Results The performance of these parametric and nonparametric models has been evaluated using the performance metrics MAE and RMSE which are deﬁned as follows: (32) (33) The RMSE is the square root of the mean of the squared dif- ference between the actual and estimated values of power. It is a measure of the average magnitude of error and is a quadratic scoring rule. The MAE is the mean of the absolute values of the differences between the actual and estimated values of power. Unlike RMSE, MAE is a linear score since the individual differ- ences are weighted equally in the average.2 The value of RMSE is always greater than or equal to MAE. The difference between the RMSE and MAE values highlights the variance in the indi- vidual errors in the sample. The MAE and RMSE values of the discussed algorithms have been tabulated in Table VI for all the datasets. The algorithms have been ranked based on their error measures in Table VII, for each dataset. In order to determine the best modeling technique, the average rank is calculated and the overall performance is as- certained based on both the error measures. It can be observed that the wind turbine power curve model was built using the ﬁve-parameter logistic function, whose parameters are solved by the DE algorithm ranks number 1, for both the error mea- sures. When the RMSE measure alone is considered, NN is ranked 2, and the power curve model built using the ﬁve-pa- rameter logistic function with the parameters solved using PSO is ranked 3. If the MAE measure is considered, the linearized segmented model is ranked 2 and NN is ranked 3. The overall performance and the ranking of all the algorithms excluding dataset 1, is tabulated in Table VIII. It is very inter- esting to note that, when the statistically generated data, dataset 1 is ignored, and the overall performance is calculated only for 2Available: http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/veriﬁca- tion/www/english/msg/ver_cont_var/uos3/uos3_ko1.htm This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

The parametric models obtain the ﬁrst three ranks, and the NN algorithm is ranked 4 for both error measures. When the RMSE measure is considered, the model built by the ﬁve-parametric logistic ex- pression solved using DE is ranked 1, the model developed by the four-parametric logistic expression solved by DE is ranked 2, and the model based on the ﬁve-parametric logistic expres- sion solved using PSO is ranked 3. When the MAE measure is considered, the model built by the ﬁve-parametric logistic expression solved using DE is ranked 1, the model developed by the linearized segmented model is ranked 2, and the model based on the ﬁve-parametric logistic expression solved using PSO is ranked 3. In general, when the dataset is huge, an accurate model of the wind turbine power curve can be developed using the ﬁve-parameter logistic func- tion, whose parameters are determined by the DE algorithm. V. CONCLUSION The wind turbine power curve has been modeled using ad- vanced algorithms in this paper. Application of the DE algo- rithm to a ﬁve-parameter logistic function gives the best para- metric model of a wind turbine power curve. The neural network algorithm gives the best nonparametric model. These models can be used to monitor the online performance of the wind tur- bine and also for developing wind power forecasting models.
