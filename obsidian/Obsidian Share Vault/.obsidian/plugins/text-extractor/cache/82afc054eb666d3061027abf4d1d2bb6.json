ABSTRACT As utilities and regions across the country experience increased penetration of energy efficiency and other distributed energy resources (DERs), many are exploring ways to comprehensively assess the multidimensional value of DERs. When strategically situated to target locational and temporal needs, DERs can defer or even avoid transmission and distribution (T&D) investments that would otherwise be needed to meet increasing demand. The potential avoided electric T&D investments are immense: annual U.S. investments have grown 9.2 percent on average between 2013 and 2016 (Knutson 2017), and transmission investment alone is projected to exceed $68 billion from 2018 to 2020 (EEI 2017). Avoiding T&D investments with energy efficiency and other DERs requires jurisdictional efforts to evaluate locational and temporal needs (including load forecasts and congestion) and the capability of DERs to respond to those needs. Utilities and regulators can encourage the strategic siting of DERs by: (1) requiring utilities to consider DERs as a resource in distribution planning; (2) developing better screening and selection practices for DERs; and (3) creating and refining methodologies to derive locational and temporal (L-T) values of DERs to T&D. This paper focuses on L-T valuation methodologies and emerging practices being developed in two innovative states: New York and California. The paper also provides a summary of how these states addressed several key considerations. This summary is useful for utilities, states, and other stakeholders when developing similar methodologies. Utilities are testing a variety of approaches, and refinements are likely to occur over time as lessons are learned. Introduction Utilities nationwide are responding to the continued proliferation and penetration of energy efficiency and other DERs in a variety of ways. As customers procure more and more DERs—either through utilities, self-procurement, or with the assistance of third parties—utilities need to better evaluate the potential risks and opportunities these new technologies bring to their T&D systems. This paper explores the emerging practice of considering DERs on a locational and temporal level. We are closely following the ways in which utilities in two particularly innovative states—New York and California—are improving distribution planning processes to better incorporate DERs. 1 In general, states are considering three primary ways to improve distribution planning: 1 We also provided comments during the development of some of the New York methodologies (CEP 2018). ©2018 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings 6-1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
