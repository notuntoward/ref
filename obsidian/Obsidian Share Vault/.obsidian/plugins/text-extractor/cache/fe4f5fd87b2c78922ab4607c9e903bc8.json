Here and there, an F-bomb was thrown in both directions. Trump’s team was triumphal; Harris’s looked and sounded as grim as you’d expect from anyone forced to participate in their own autopsy. “You all had a better strategy and a strategy that worked. You won this race,” Quentin Fulks, Kamala Harris’s principal deputy campaign manager, said during one intense exchange. “Look, we’re eating it. We lost the race.” Over the sessions’ four hours, some of the most sensitive moments involved what-did-you- know-and-when-did-you-know-it questions from the moderators about President Joe Biden’s physical and mental fitness. Did anyone tell him after his disastrous debate performance in June that the race was unwinnable if he stayed in? “We’re here to represent the Harris campaign,” campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon snapped. “We are not here to have conversations about private conversations with the president.” Follow Karen Tumulty Certainly, the 2024 election departed from the normal script. There was a midsummer scramble around a sitting president dropping Review | \u0000e best albums of 2024: Top pop from Jessica Pratt to Kendrick Lamar FOR YOU 12/16/24, 8:37 PM Opinion | The economy decided the election, Harvard meeting reveals - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/7 his bid for a second term just 107 days before the election, and two assassination attempts against the Republican nominee. The word “unprecedented” does not begin to describe the contest. What struck me as an observer of these postmortems over the years, however, was how much the two sides in this cycle agreed upon. Both were seeing the same currents at work — chiefly, public anger over high prices — underneath the daily and sometimes hourly tempests that distracted and transfixed the political class. “Ultimately, the economic stuff at the end of the day was the driver,” Fulks said. But the sessions made clear that the Harris team had its hands full with its candidate and her record. For instance, Donald Trump’s most commented-upon ads in the closing days of the race highlighted the fact that Harris said in 2019 that she supported taxpayer-funded transgender treatments for prison inmates and detained migrants. The spots ended with the tagline: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.” Testing their effect with voters, the Harris team found those ads to be “sticky,” pollster Molly Murphy said, adding, “In a media landscape Review | \u0000e best albums of 2024: Top pop from Jessica Pratt to Kendrick Lamar FOR YOU 12/16/24, 8:37 PM Opinion | The economy decided the election, Harvard meeting reveals - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 3/7 with lots and lots of ads, it broke through.” Because the spots used video of Harris and her own words, her campaign found no effective way to respond to them directly. But far more damaging to Harris, both sides agreed, was a different set of ads, featuring the vice president declaring, “Bidenomics is working.” Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita said: “We ran that more than any other.” When Harris replaced Biden on the ticket, Trump’s polling saw her favorability numbers shoot up roughly 20 points. Pollster Tony Fabrizio, a veteran of decades in politics, said it was a “rocket ride” unlike anything he had ever seen. But the positive views of her were still barely even with the negative ones, and she remained a largely unknown figure. “Unless we jumped into the fray, she was going to redefine herself,” Fabrizio said. Their chief goal, he added, was “not to allow her to untether herself from Biden and the Biden record.” So it was a gift to the Trump campaign when Harris, appearing on “The View,” was asked whether there was anything she would have done differently from the current president. “There is not a thing that comes to mind in Review | \u0000e best albums of 2024: Top pop from Jessica Pratt to Kendrick Lamar FOR YOU 12/16/24, 8:37 PM Opinion | The economy decided the election, Harvard meeting reveals - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 4/7 terms of — and I’ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact,” she said. Harris’s campaign recognized the self-inflicted wound “the moment she said it,” Fulks recalled. The vice president reinforced what had been “a big looming negative over us the whole time,” he said, which was the difficulty in separating Harris from public perceptions of Biden’s performance on the economy. Which leads to another important takeaway: Other events that created sensations in the media and among committed partisans barely registered with the small set of Americans whom the two campaigns were most focused on in the final stretch. These were the undecided and persuadable voters — who tended to be disengaged, younger, economically disadvantaged and male. A case in point was the political crossfire that erupted when a comedian at Trump’s Oct. 27 rally in Madison Square Garden called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage,” and Biden a few days later made a comment that sounded like he viewed Trump supporters as garbage. As Harris volunteers knocked on doors of targeted voters, they found that few were even aware of the controversy. Outwardly, the Harris campaign expressed confidence. On election eve, senior adviser David Plouffe told CNN that the early vote Review | \u0000e best albums of 2024: Top pop from Jessica Pratt to Kendrick Lamar FOR YOU 12/16/24, 8:37 PM Opinion | The economy decided the election, Harvard meeting reveals - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 5/7 numbers suggested Harris had a “credible pathway” to win all seven swing states. But privately, O’Malley Dillon said, “our internal data was much closer this time than we saw in 2020.” While her own side has “real structural things to think through,” she said, the key to winning again begins with the Democratic Party again becoming where a majority of voters “feel at home.” Post Opinions wants to know: What was the most important event of the year that had nothing to do with the U.S. presidential election?
