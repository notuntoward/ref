In 4 years, a child has seen 50 times more data than the biggest LLMs. 1E13 tokens is pretty much all the quality text publicly available on the Internet. It would take 170k years for a human to read (8 h/day, 250 word/minute). Text is simply too low bandwidth and too scarce a modality to learn how the world works. Video is more redundant, but redundancy is precisely what you need for Self- Supervised Learning to work well. Incidentally, 16k hours of video is about 30 minutes of Y ouTube uploads. https://lnkd.in/eDq3tq4V 7,281 326 comments · 377 reposts … Comment Repost Send Add a comment… Most relevant Danko Nikolic • 2nd Head of AI and Data Science | Co-founder | Consulting on AI | Brain scientist | AI scientist Like · 137 Reply · 43 R eplies Load previous replies 3mo (edited) I think this calculation is based on the wrong premise. It is not more data that makes us more intelligent than GPT. It is the inductive biases that we are born with and that evolution has carefully crafted for us.

Sight, sound (not just speech), feel, context and environment details. All of this in contrastive fashion.

We don’t just process ambiguity into meaning out of noise when we learn, we’re preconditioned through evolution to receive and build intelligence, practicality and wisdom out of socially provided intergenerational multisensual stimuli.
