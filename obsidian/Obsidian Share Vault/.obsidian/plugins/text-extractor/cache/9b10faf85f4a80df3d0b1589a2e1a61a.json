We study the effects of positive and negative advertising in presidential elections. We develop a model to disentangle these effects on voter turnout and candidate choice. The central empirical challenges are highly correlated and endogenous advertising quantities that are measured with error. To address these challenges, we construct a large set of potential instruments, including interactions with incumbency that we demonstrate provide the critical identifying variation, and apply machine-learning causal inference methods. Using data from the 2000 and 2004 U.S. presidential elections, we ﬁnd that positive and negative ads play funda- mentally different roles. Negative ads are more effective at driving relative candidate shares, whereas positive ads stimulate turnout. These results indicate that a candidate geographically targeting tone trades off local relative share gains and local increases in turnout for localities with a strong base. Counterfactual simulations, where the candidates adjust the quantity of pos- itive and negative advertising while budgets remain ﬁxed, indicate that ad tone alone can impact the outcome of close elections. Our analysis also provides potential explanations as to why past studies have produced mixed ﬁndings on both ad-tone and turnout effects. History: Accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.

Introduction During the 2018 Super Bowl, Budweiser introduced the “Bud Knight” in a medieval-themed ad campaign about a knight who picks up some Bud Light at a con- venience store and, subsequently, helps out a king. The ad struck a light-hearted, positive tone by focus- ing solely on the Bud Light brand. In contrast, during the 2019 Super Bowl, Bud Light aired negative ads that used the same medieval setting to allege that Miller Lite and Coors Light used corn syrup in their brewing processes. 3 Negative advertising of this sort, where one brand highlights the perceived weaknesses or unfavorable attributes of another brand, is now commonplace. Prominent examples of negative adver- tising can be found across a variety of industries, such as technology (Mac versus PC), restaurants (Domino’s versus Subway), and insurance (Esurance versus Geico). 4 As these examples illustrate, positive ads solely emphasize the advertising brand, whereas negative ads aim to contrast against or denigrate another brand. Brain-imaging studies demonstrate that nega- tive stimuli and positive stimuli elicit distinct responses (Ito et al. 1998, Ito and Cacioppo 2000). Research in psychology and behavioral economics shows that negative stimuli have a stronger impact on subsequent behavior (Thaler 1985, Pratto and John 1991, Cacioppo et al. 1997, Baumeister et al. 2001). However, negative ads have risks: They could back- ﬁre (Phillips et al. 2007), dilute attention to the advertiser (Galasso et al. 2021), or reduce turnout (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995). Hence, the efﬁcacy of negative ads is theoretically ambiguous. 220 MANAGEMENT SCIENCE Vol. 69, No. 1, January 2023, pp. 220–243 ISSN 0025-1909 (print), ISSN 1526-5501 (online)https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mnsc In our setting of political advertising, negative ads are a prominent feature. Voters decry their use, and the media and scholars debate their efﬁcacy (Geer 2008, Mattes and Redlawsk 2014). 5 Research examines whether negative advertising affects voter turnout (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995, Freedman et al. 2004) and, more broadly, how voters respond differ- ently to positive and negative advertising (Lau 1985, Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995, Goldstein and Freed- man 2002, Phillips et al. 2007,Kim et al. 2009,Wang et al. 2018). 6 Another literature focuses on the supply-side of political competition, while assuming differential effects by ad tone (Harrington and Hess 1996,Polborn and Yi 2006, Lovett and Shachar 2011, Lovettetal. 2019). Despite the attention this topic garners, meta-analyses ﬁnd that the evidence of a differential effect between positive and negative ads on voters is inconclusive or contradictory (Lau et al. 1999, 2007). We provide new evidence that documents signiﬁcant and asymmetric effects for positive and negative ads in U.S. presidential elections. We measure the average effect of positive and negative advertisements, including the difference in their effects. To disentangle these ad-tone effects, we present a model of voter turnout and candidate choice that separates the ad effects on primary and secondary demand. Unlike standard discrete-choice models, our approach parsimoniously allows each tone to differ for relative candidate share and voter turnout. We show that disentangling these ad-tone effects is nec- essary to obtain accurate estimates. 7 In disentangling the effects of ad tone, we face three empirical challenges. First, candidates’ advertising choices may be inﬂuenced by factors observed by campaigns and voters, but unobserved by the researcher. Second, adver- tising choicestend to be correlated acrosscandidatesand tone. Third, commonly used data on advertising expo- sures by tone likely contain measurement error due to measure construction and tone classiﬁcation. To address these challenges, we employ an instru- mental variables strategy that draws on recent advan- ces in machine learning for causal inference (Belloni et al. 2012). We create a set of base instruments by combining advertising cost instruments from Gordon and Hartmann (2013) and local voter characteristics from surrounding counties (Li et al. 2019), the latter of which serve as Waldfogel-style preference-externality instruments. This collection of instruments helps to identify the effect of overall advertising levels. To separately identify the ad-tone effects, we incor- porate instruments that shift a candidate’s opportu- nity to use negative advertising. Speciﬁcally, we rely on interactions with a candidate’s incumbency status to help measure differential opportunities to go nega- tive. Incumbents, by their very nature, have more extensive public records (e.g., public speeches, bills sponsored, executive actions, etc.) that provide the basis for opposition research by the challenger (Norris 2007, Krieger 2017). This opposition research helps a challenger identify more opportunities to use negative ads because they can attack the record of the incum- bent party candidate (Kahn et al. 1999, Lovett and Sha- char 2011, LBBOnline.com 2016, Ellickson et al. 2019). We control for the direct effect of incumbency and introduce as instruments interactions between the incumbency status and the base instruments, allowing us to ﬂexibly capture how challengers and incumbents respond differently to advertising costs and local voter characteristics. In Section 5.3, among other robustness checks, we show that these new interaction instru- ments provide the critical variation to separate ad tone. This large set of instruments helps to address the high correlation between advertising variables, but leads us to worry about overﬁtting noise in the ﬁrst- stage, the so-called “many weak instruments” prob- lem (Angrist and Pischke 2009). To deal with this concern, we frame the ﬁrst-stage regression as a pre- diction problem, as advocated by Mullainathan and Spiess (2017) and others, and use the LASSO IV meth- odology developed in Belloni et al. (2012) to identify the appropriate sparse set of instruments to use. This method approximates the optimal instruments in order to disentangle the effects from the highly corre- lated advertising variables, while providing theoreti- cal guarantees against overﬁtting. We apply the model to data from the 2000 and 2004 U.S. presidential elections. We ﬁnd that positive and negative ads are both important and exhibit asymmet- ric effects on voters’ choices. Negative advertising has a stronger impact on relative candidate share (elastic- ity of 0.025) than positive advertising (0.016). This stronger impact of negative advertising stems from decreasing the opponent’s attractiveness, while leaving the advertiser’s attractiveness relatively unchanged. Hence, negative ads decrease turnout slightly (−0.007), but increase the candidate’srelative vote share more than positive ads. In contrast, positive ads increase the attractiveness of voting, increasing overall turnout (0.030), but the advertiser doesn’t necessarily capture all of these beneﬁts. Thus, although both ad tones improve a candidate’s relative share, ad tones have asymmetric effects. These results indicate that a candi- date deciding which tone to use has to weigh the trade- off between relative share and turnout beneﬁts. We evaluate a series of alternative estimation approaches to determine the impact of the various aspects of our empirical strategy. Without accounting for both advertising tones, turnout effects are under- stated. This ﬁnding might explain some of the null effects in the literature (Lovett and Peress 2015, Spen- kuch and Toniatti 2018). Ignoring either the endogene- ity of advertising or the many-instruments problem, we falsely attribute positive ad effects to negative ads. Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) 221 Finally, if we instead rely on a border-discontinuity strategy to estimate ad effects (Spenkuch and Toniatti 2018, Wang et al. 2018), which does not address meas- urement error in ad exposures, both tones’ effects are understated. Thus, our overall modeling approach is necessary to obtain an accurate understanding of the effect of advertising tones. We conduct a series of partial-equilibrium counter- factual simulations with the goal of illustrating the importance of ad-tone choices. All simulations assume that campaign budgets are held ﬁxed. The ﬁrst set of simulations forces all advertising to be either positive or negative. These simulations are similar to bans on negative advertising that have been implemented out- side of the United States. 8 We ﬁnd, after banning neg- ative ads, that turnout increases by around 10 million voters, and, in close elections, the outcome of the race can swing between candidates based purely on ad-tone changes. The second set of simulations exam- ines optimal ad-tone decisions, manipulating whether one campaign or both campaigns reallocate the tone of their ads. If one campaign is sophisticated (i.e., opti- mal) in allocating ad tone, then it can gain an advant- age and swing a close election based only on targeting ad tone. However, if both campaigns are sophisti- cated, the advantages cancel, so that no substantial electoral changes materialize. Our research contributes to the broader literature on political advertising that focuses on ad-tone effects. First, despite extensive research, empirical ﬁndings are largely inconclusive or contradictory on the link between ad tone and voter choices (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995, Lau et al. 1999, Goldstein and Freedman 2002, Lau et al. 2007, Phillips et al. 2007, Wang et al. 2018). For instance, Ansolabehere and Iyengar (1995) ﬁnd that negative advertising decreases turnout, Goldstein and Freedman (2002) ﬁnd that it stimulates turnout, and yet more recent research suggests that advertising has no turnout effects (Lovett and Peress 2015, Spenkuch and Toniatti 2018). We present evi- dence that negative advertising has a small, insigniﬁ- cant negative effect on turnout. We also show that positive advertising has a signiﬁcant and positive turnout effect that is signiﬁcantly larger than the turn- out effect of negative advertising. Thus, we offer new evidence that negative advertising either depresses or has no effect on turnout, whereas positive ads stimu- late turnout. Second, although consistent with the existing literature, we ﬁnd relative share advertising effects that are small, yet meaningful (Gordon and Hartmann 2013, Lovett and Peress 2015, Spenkuch and Toniatti 2018,Wang et al. 2018). Importantly, we clarify that negative advertising has a signiﬁcantly larger effect than positive ads in decreasing the oppo- nent’s share. Thus, we provide evidence for the differ- ential effects of positive and negative advertising related to both turnout and candidate shares. Third, our analysis reveals potential explanations as to why past studies have provided mixed ﬁndings on both ad-tone effects and turnout effects (Lau et al. 2007). Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that disentangling these effects in our application requires the full approach we use—a model that both distinguishes primary and secondary demand effects and accounts for both tones; instru- ments that can separate the ad tones and address both measurement error and traditional endogeneity bias; and a method that can provide efﬁcient estimates, while avoiding the many-instruments problem. It is helpful to contrast our work speciﬁcally with two recent papers. Spenkuch and Toniatti (2018)use a border-discontinuity approach to estimate the effect of ads on outcomes in presidential elections. However, their analysis focuses on the overall ad effect, with only a brief explorationof the effects by ad tone onturnout, which they ﬁnd are insigniﬁcant (Spenkuch and Toniatti 2018, table 3). Our analysis entirely focuses on the effects of ad tone on both turnout and candidate choice. Instead of relying on a border-discontinuity approach, we leverage a potentially more powerful instrumenting approach (Li et al. 2019) using incumbency interactions and LASSO IV to address the endogeneity and measurement error issues in our setting and allowing us to jointly account for both advertising tones. Our ﬁndings are distinct because we obtain signiﬁcant effectsofpositive ads on turnout and signiﬁcant candidate choice effects for nega- tive ads. The second paper is Wang et al. (2018), which uses a border-discontinuity strategy similar to Spenkuch and Toniatti (2018), butwith anapplication to Senate races. Our paper differs from Wang et al. (2018)in that we focus on presidential elections, use a different estima- tion methodology, and obtain different results about ad effects by tone. 9 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, weintroduce thedata and providea descrip- tion of the key variables under study. In Section 3,we introduce the model that we use to disentangle ad-tone effects on primary and secondary demand. Section 4 describes the estimation and instruments. Section 5 presents the estimation results, ad elasticity estimates, and several robustness checks. Section 6 discusses the counterfactuals. Finally, we conclude in Section 7. 2. Data The data focus on the 2000 and 2004 U.S. presidential elections. We collect data on advertising levels, adver- tising costs, votes, and various variables that char- acterize media markets, states, or counties. In this section, we provide a brief description of the data and their sources, before discussing the relevant variation. The TV advertising data are provided by the Cam- paign Media Analysis Group (CMAG) through the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project. 10 CMAG Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects 222 Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) records every political ad that aired on TV in the top 75 designated market areas (DMAs) in the country, including the exact date and time of its airing, the ad’s sponsor, its length, and an estimate of its cost. Critical for this study, the tone of each ad is manually coded according to “promote,”“attack,” and “contrast.” In keeping with the literature, we refer to “promote” ads as “positive” ads and group “attack” and “contrast” ads into a single “negative” ad-tone category. Our pri- mary explanatory variable of interest, advertising exposures per capita, is expressed in terms of Gross Rating Points (GRPs). 11 This measure is constructed from a combination of advertising-cost and advertising- quantity data using the approach in Gordon and Hart- mann (2013). We follow Gordon and Hartmann (2013) and Lovett and Shachar (2011)and focus on all adsaired in support of a particular candidate after September 1 in each year, regardless of the ad’ssponsor, because this date is generally viewed as the start of the General Elec- tion campaign period. Table 1 presents summary statistics on advertising for each election, candidate, and ad tone. Across elec- tions, changes in voter preferences, advertising costs, and incumbency status generate temporal variation in ad levels and the mix of tones. In both elections, each candidate purchases more negative than positive ads, and the incumbent party (Democrat in 2000 and Republican in 2004) airs fewer negative ads relative to the challenger. This ﬁnding is consistent with Hale et al. (1996) and Peterson and Djupe (2005), which document that negativity is higher for challengers than incumbents. The fact that incumbents air rela- tively fewer negative ads is also consistent with Lovett and Shachar (2011), who argue that incumbents gener- ate more information for voters, and Steinhauer and Weisman (2012), who argue that such advertising pat- terns are consistent with the idea that challengers have more opportunities to go negative because their opposition research can build on the entirety of the incumbent’s record (LBBOnline.com 2016). Votes, the sole outcome variable of interest, are at the county level and are obtained from https:// polidata.org/. Restricting attention to the 75 DMAs in the advertising data, we observe 1,607 counties. We construct vote shares from these data, which use esti- mates of the voting age population to calculate the share of voters in a county who turned out to vote. Figure 1 plots the distribution of GRPs across candi- dates by ad tone against the (two-party) relative vote share in a particular state. Within an election, geo- graphic variation in ad levels is largely due to differ- ences in the closeness of the race in that state. States with a relative vote share closer to 50% are “battleground states” because there was greater uncertainty in these cases about which candidate would win the plurality of votes and receive the state’s electoral votes. Battle- ground states attract a disproportionate share of advertising, regardless of tone. This produces a high correlation of 0.88 between the amount of positive and negative ads, which makes separating their causal effects challenging. Our empirical strategy for separating these effects relies on incumbents and challengers responding dif- ferently to local market conditions. Conditioning on the incumbency status of the candidate, we demon- strate visually that the choice to use positive or Table 1.

We illustrate how incumbents and chal- lengers respond with different tones to the same local market condition, unemployment rate. In Figure 2,we plot the quantity of advertising against the unemploy- ment rate in the battleground states, after removing state ﬁxed effects. In panel (a), for positive advertising, the regression lines indicate a slight difference in how incumbents and challengers respond to the unemploy- ment rate. However, for negative advertising (panel (b)), the difference is meaningful and statistically sig- niﬁcant. As the unemployment rate increases, the chal- lenger becomes relatively more likely to go negative than the incumbent. This is consistent with a supply- side story where greater unemployment provides opportunities for challengers to attack the records of incumbents. Finally, we measure these local market characteris- tics using data on a range of market, state, and county-level variables. We use demographic and socio-economic variables from the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), such as age, ethnicity, educational attainment, and the unemployment rate. We use information on county-level rain and snowfall on Election Day because Gomez et al. (2007) show that the weather can affect voter turnout. Information on the election context, such as state-level electoral votes, are drawn from the Federal Election Commis- sion. Measures for the competitiveness of a state are obtained from the Cook Political Report, which has been used in prior studies (Lovett and Shachar 2011). Among the media-market-level information, we use lagged advertising-cost measures from SQAD, a TV advertising market research ﬁrm. We discuss our con- struction of the instruments and their interpretations in detail in Section 4.1. Additional ﬁgures showing the temporal variations in ads, votes, and local market characteristics are presented in the online appendix. 3. Model The purpose of the structural model is to quantify the effects of advertising tone on whether a citizen votes and, if so, for whom their vote is cast. We aim to incor- porate advertising tone in a manner consistent with the insights from the psychological and behavioral economics literatures that suggest voters’ impressions of candidates account for positive and negative aspects differently (Cacioppo et al. 1997, Baumeister et al. 2001, Holbrook et al. 2001). To do so, we begin with a simple model of choice that only includes a candidate’s own advertising quantities, both positive and negative, in the utility speciﬁcation. Next, we explain how this speciﬁcation restricts our ability to properly estimate advertising-tone effects. Finally, we detail our proposed approach that more ﬂexibly cap- tures substitution patterns across the inside and out- side choices in the utility model and show how this ﬂexibility is necessary to capture the differential effects in advertising tone. Starting with a simple model of voter choice as a function of advertising, the utility of voter i for candi- date j ∈{R, D} in county c, located within DMA m, Figure 2.

Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects 224 Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) during election year t is uijct \u0003 βjt + ˜αP log(AP,jmt)+ ˜αN log(AN,jmt)+ φ ′Xjct + γjc + ξjct + εijct, (1) where AP,jmt (AN,jmt) is the number of positive (negative) advertising GRPs run by candidate j in DMA m.Because prior work has established that advertising tends to suf- fer from diminishing returns (Hanssens et al. 1990), we applya logtransformation to ad exposures (Horskyand Simon 1983,Gordon and Hartmann 2013). 12 Parameter ˜ατ,for τ ∈{P, N}, measures the effect of advertising of tone τ. We include two levels of ﬁxed effects: βjt, for elec- tion t and party j, to represent the mean national prefer- ence for the candidate; and γjc,for county c and party j, to absorb time invariant local preferences for a party. Xjct are a set of exogenous control variables that can vary by party, county, and time. The ξjct is an election-county- party demand shock that is observed by voters and potentially by candidates, but is unobserved by research- ers. This shock could represent additional information the campaign has on time-varying local voter preferen- ces that is not otherwise captured in the rest of our con- trol variables. The presence of this unobservable, ξjct, may generate a confounding correlation between adver- tising levels that candidates set and voters’ choices. εijct is a shock that captures idiosyncratic preferences across voters and time for particular candidates, perhaps due to unobserved differences in political ideology or varia- tion in voters’ information. To complete the model, we normalize the utility for the outside good of not voting, denoted j \u0003 0, to be ui0ct \u0003 εi0ct: (2) This model formulation departs from prior structural modeling work that estimates a single, common ˜α parameter on the total advertising for each candidate (Gordon and Hartmann 2013, 2016; Gillen et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019). Given our interest in separating ad tones, we consider both ˜αP and ˜αN, the effects of posi- tive AP,jmt and negative AN,jmt advertising on individ- ual i’s utility. With the usual assumption that εijct is independent and identically distributed type 1 extreme value, we can integrate over these unobservables. Letting δjct represent all the terms in (1) except for εijct, the vote share for candidate j is: sjct \u0003 exp(δjct) 1 + ∑j′exp(δj′ct) , (3) with the implicit normalization of δ0ct \u0003 0. To highlight the restrictions this initial model imposes on measuring ad-tone effects, consider the elasticity of advertising-tone τ on the own and opponent candidate’s share, the relative two-party share, and voter turnout. Let sj|j≠0 denote a candidate’s relative share (among candidates) and 1 − s0 be the turnout percentage. Own : ∂sj ∂Aτ,j Aτ,j sj \u0003 ˜ατ(1 − sj),(4) Cross : ∂sj′ ∂Aτ,j Aτ,j sj′ \u0003− ˜ατsj,(5) Relative Share : ∂sj|j≠0 ∂Aτ,j Aτ,j sj|j≠0 \u0003 ˜ατ(1 − sj|j≠0),(6) Turnout : ∂(1 − s0) ∂Aτ,j Aτ,j (1 − s0) \u0003 ˜ατsj|j≠0s0: (7) The restrictive form of own- and cross-elasticities, which only depend on the ad coefﬁcients ˜ατ and own shares sj, is a well-known limitation of multinomial logit models. A further implication of this speciﬁca- tion is that the effect of advertising Aτ,j on turnout and relative shares must have the same sign. This restriction is particularly concerning in politics because the signs for negative advertising might dif- fer: As the quote from Cillizza at the start of the paper highlights, most commentators believe that negative advertising is effective at improving a candidate’srel- ative share, yet a strand of existing research also ﬁnds that negative advertising decreases voter turnout (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995). The model in Equa- tions (1)–(3) is unable to reconcile these views. Com- mon generalizations, such as a nested logit model, would not relax this particular restriction around the sign of relative share and turnout elasticities, because both elasticities would still depend on the same coefﬁ- cient, ˜ατ. 13 Amore ﬂexible form is required to account for the potentially different effects of advertising on outcomes (Liu et al. 2014, Anderson et al. 2016). We introduce this ﬂexibility by modifying the out- side good’s utility. Instead of normalizing it to zero, we allow the outside good utility to depend on the advertising of both candidates: ui0ct \u0003− αP,0 log(AP,jmt)− αN,0 log(AN,jmt) − αP,0 log(AP,j′mt)− αN,0 log(AN,j′mt)+ εi0ct, (8) where −αP,0 and −αN,0 represent the effect of positive and negative advertising, respectively, on the outside good utility. To put this back into a standard own-utility approach with the outside good normalized to zero, we update the utility of voting for a given candidate as a function of both the candidate’sown advertising amounts and the opponent’s advertising amounts. The resulting net util- ity speciﬁcation becomes: ˜uijct \u0003 βjt + αP log(AP,jmt)+ αN log(AN,jmt) + αP,0 log(AP,j′mt)+ αN,0 log(AN,j′mt) + φ ′Xjct + γjc + ξjct + εijct,(9) Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) 225 where αP \u0003 ˜αP + αP,0 and αN \u0003 ˜αN + αN,0. This implies that the effect of candidate advertising on voters util- ity for them (the “own utility” effect) in this model set-up combines the candidate effect and the outside good effect. As a result, the ατ,0 (αN,0 or αP,0)also changes meaning, now representing the opponent’s advertising effect on the candidate utility (the “opponent utility” effect). 14 Importantly, this formulation is consis- tent with the kind of distinct evaluations for positive and negative features in the impression-formation litera- ture (Cacioppo et al. 1997, Holbrook et al. 2001). 15 Given the new utility speciﬁcation, consider the same set of elasticities: Own : ∂sj ∂Aτ,j Aτ,j sj \u0003 ατ(1 − sj)− ατ,0sj′, (10) Cross : ∂sj′ ∂Aτ,j Aτ,j sj′ \u0003−ατsj + ατ,0(1 − sj′ ), (11) Relative Share : ∂sj|j≠0 ∂Aτ,j Aτ,j sj|j≠0 \u0003(ατ −ατ,0)(1−sj|j≠0), (12) Turnout : ∂(1−s0) ∂Aτ,j Aτ,j (1−s0) \u0003(ατsj|j≠0 +ατ,0sj′|j′≠0)s0: (13) The ﬁrst term in the own elasticity captures the effects of a candidate’s own advertising and is the same as in Equation (4). This term reﬂects substitution away from the outside good and from the opponent due to the increase in own utility. The second term repre- sents the effect of a candidate’s advertising on their opponent’s utility, ατ,0,and reﬂects an additional source of share stealing. If a candidate runs a negative advertisement about the opponent, then the sign of the coefﬁcient for the negative ad run by the candidate may be positive in their own utility αN and negative in the opponent’s utility αN,0. In this case, the opponent- utility component magniﬁes both the own and cross- elasticities. The importance of these multiple parameters is clearer when examining the elasticity of advertising on relative share and turnout. Continuing with the same example, where αN has a positive sign and αN,0 a negative sign, the elasticity of negative advertising on relative share will be positive. On the other hand, depending on the relative size of αN versus αN,0 and the candidates’ relative vote shares, the elasticity of negative advertising on turnout may be positive or negative. Thus, by allowing a candidate’s advertising choice to affect their own and opponent’s utility dif- ferently, this allows the advertiser’s relative share to increase, while decreasing turnout. This ﬂexibility in the sign of the ad-tone effects is not possible using the standard speciﬁcation pre- sented in Equations (1)–(7). By allowing the voter’s utility for a given candidate to be governed by not only the advertising choices of the candidate, but also their opponent, our model is able to rationalize more nuanced patterns in voting behavior that reﬂect important possible advertising effects. 4. Estimation In this section, we present our estimation strategy and the variables used in our model, including the instru- ments. We use the instrumental variables (IV) estima- tor and share inversion from Berry (1994), such that county-level vote shares are inverted and take the form of δjct − δ0ct \u0003 log(sjct)− log(s0ct). These vote shares serve as the dependent variable in our estima- tion. However, our approach to the instrumental vari- ables estimation is quite different and leverages recent advances in machine learning for causal inference (Belloni et al. 2012, 2014). 16 4.1. Instruments Two endogeneity concerns are paramount. The ﬁrst is measurement error in the advertising variables that would attenuate the effect sizes under the standard errors-in-variables case. Our advertising variables are based on noisy estimates of spending at the ad unit level (from CMAG) and noisy estimates of the price of ad exposures (provided by SQAD). In addition, the manual coding of advertisements into positive and negative categories is also likely to have measurement error. 17 The magnitude of each of these two sources of error is difﬁcult to evaluate within the context of our data set, but we suspect the errors are meaningful. 18 The second concern stems from the potential corre- lation between the county-level unobserved demand shocks ξjct and the DMA-level advertising choices of candidates. As discussed above, candidates target more ads to markets in battleground states, where there is greater uncertainty over the winner of the state-level race. Candidates may also strategically choose ad tone if they seek to increase turnout (posi- tive ads) or increase relative share (negative ads). To address these endogeneity concerns, we con- struct a set of base instruments using advertising costs and Waldfogel instruments (Waldfogel 2003,Li et al. 2019), along with nonlinear functions of these instru- ments, which we collectively refer to as our base- series instruments. These base-series instruments identify the effects of total advertising levels. To dis- tinguish the multiple ad-tone effects, we introduce interactions between the base-series instruments and incumbency status. We demonstrate in Section 5.3 that these incumbency interactions provide the critical variation to identify the multiple ad-tone effects. For our base instruments, the cost instruments fol- low Gordon and Hartmann (2013) and are the prior year cost-per-thousand (CPM) impressions in each of Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects 226 Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) eight day parts (e.g., prime time, daytime, and early morning). Advertising costs shift the incentive of whether and how much to advertise in different mar- kets. Using the lagged costs avoids any bias due to presidential candidates affecting the contemporane- ous ad prices. Our base instruments also include a set of Waldfo- gel instruments. Waldfogel instruments are applicable to situations where a decision variable (advertising) is set at a more aggregate geographic level (DMA) than the underlying data available (counties). Instruments can be formed based on summary statistics of local conditions in other counties that do not affect the focal county demand. To illustrate the intuition, we use a particularly stark example where one DMA spans two states. Fig- ure 3 shows that the Chicago DMA covers counties in Illinois (nonbattleground) and Indiana (battleground). Ads purchased for Chicago are delivered to all coun- ties in the DMA, regardless of state boundaries; a can- didate cannot advertise solely to voters in the ﬁve Indiana counties. Thus, a candidate’s decision to advertise in Chicago depends on two factors: (i) the cost of ads in the market relative to the number of addressable target voters; and (ii) the propensity of these voters to turnout and vote for the candidate. The presence of the Illinois counties may lead a candi- date to place fewer ads in Chicago than if the DMA only covered Indiana. Waldfogel instruments takes advantage of the fact that advertising decisions are set at the DMA level, which leads some counties to be “treated” with too much advertising (Illinois) and others with too little (Indiana), relative to what those geographies would be expected to receive in a fully targeted decision. Although this example illustrates the circumstance where a DMA covers two states, any geographic unit can be used. When a DMA is fully contained within a state, advertising is ﬁxed at the DMA level, even though the voters across its counties have differing values to the candidate. This leads to variation in the degree to which voters in some counties are treated with more—and others with less—advertising of a particular tone than if the advertising were perfectly targeted. The key identifying assumption of this approach is that no demand spillovers exist across counties (Berry and Haile 2016): Voter preferences in one county do not have a direct effect on voters’ choices in another county within the same DMA. For example, the assumption requires that the characteristics of voters in Lake County, Indiana, do not affect voters’ choices in Cook County, Illinois, or Porter County, Indiana, either directly or indirectly through an unobservable. With these assumptions, the instruments provide exogenous variation to explain how two otherwise identical counties residing in different DMAs are treated with different advertising levels. 19 To operationalize the Waldfogel instruments, we use summaries of characteristics in other counties in the same DMA. We control for the characteristics of the voters’ own county. Conditional on these charac- teristics, voters in that county should not be affected by voter characteristics in other counties within the same DMA, yet these other voter characteristics should be relevant for advertising decisions. Control- ling for the county’s own characteristics is important because it permits us to isolate the exogenous varia- tion in advertising that arises through the presence of the other counties on the DMA-level advertising decision. The speciﬁc variables we use fall into two broad cat- egories: socio-economic and political variables. First, we include information on the age and ethnic distri- bution of people within the county, in the form of the percentage of individuals in the county who are in a certain age range (e.g., 25–44) or of a speciﬁc ethnicity (e.g., Black). To describe the economic standing of individuals within the county, we construct four measures using data from the Census and BLS: aver- age salary, median household income, the unemploy- ment rate, and the poverty rate. Second, we use two sets of variables to capture the political preferences of voters in a county. One consists of four variables based on lagged voting outcomes at the county level. These are the lagged relative share of the Republican candidate, the lagged relative share of the Democrat candidate, the absolute difference between the vote shares, and the turnout rate in the Figure 3. (Color online) Chicago DMA Covers Counties in Illinois and Indiana Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) 227 last election. These four variables not only describe whether the residents of the county are politically active, but also how the individuals voted in the last presidential election. The second set of variables meas- ures the electoral value of winning, in terms of the state’s electoral votes, and the state’s competitiveness. Following the literature (e.g., Lovett and Shachar 2011), we use data on the competitiveness of a state from the Cook Political Report, which is based on both quantitative and qualitative information. We take the measures just prior to the start of the General Election. Competitiveness is scored between one and four, with four being the most competitive. We also include the interaction between the competitiveness measure and the electoral votes to reﬂect the fact that the expected value of winning depends on both factors. Combining the Waldfogel and cost instruments, we have 25 base instruments. We include linear (25) and quadratic (25) terms, along with all two-way inter- actions of the linear terms (300) for a total of 350 base-series variables. These base-series instruments are primarily oriented toward identifying the level of advertising. To isolate the exogenous variation in the positive and negative advertising impressions, we rely on interactions between incumbency and the base-series instruments. Ad-tone decisions differ across incum- bency status, election year, and party afﬁliation (see Table 1). As we have argued, this variation could be explained by the material that opposition research uses to identify opportunities to go negative (Kahn et al. 1999, Norris 2007, Lovett et al. 2019). The incum- bents’ records in ofﬁce, such as their public statements and votes, provide material for opposition research that challengers use to design negative ads (Norris 2007, LBBOnline.com 2016). Similarly, each election year also presents candidates with unique events to react to, and parties, because of their respective con- stituents and positions, may face different opportuni- ties to attack. Such opportunity differences could directly affect the level of advertising of different tones or could affect the response of ad-tone strategies to local mar- ket conditions. The party-year ﬁxed effects in our model absorb the direct effect. As a result, we use interactions to capture the impact of these opportunity differences on tone choices. Figure 2 shows how incumbents’ and challengers’ advertising levels respond differently to the unemployment rate in the same county. We seek to exploit the indirect effects of other counties’ preference externalities—for example, unemployment— which affect demand through the advertising levels and tone. To capture such opportunity differences, we inter- act the incumbency, party, and year variables with the base-series instruments to form additional instruments. The total number of potential instruments in our ﬁrst- stage model, after removing those that would be per- fectly collinear, is 1,254. 4.2. LASSO IV With 1,254 instruments, we need to guard against the many-weak-instruments problem (Angrist and Pischke 2009). This problem can exist even in the presence of (many) strong instruments, as it represents an overﬁt- ting problem in the ﬁrst-stage regression of a two-stage least squares, where the instruments proxy too closely for the endogenous variable. To address this problem, we use the LASSO IV tech- nique, which selects a subset of the instruments to use in the second-stage estimation (Belloni et al. 2012, 2014). This approach frames the ﬁrst stage as a predic- tion problem and uses a data-driven method to select the appropriate subset of variables to best predict the endogenous variables. Speciﬁcally, we use the post- LASSO procedure of Belloni et al. (2012). Their post- LASSO approach is tuned to guarantee convergence rates under the assumption that only a relatively small set among the potential instruments are strong. The selected subset of instrumental variables is used to estimate the causal effect of advertising tone on vot- ers’ choices in a second stage. We obtain these causal estimates using two-stage least squares (2SLS) (the typical estimator). Our ﬁrst-stage model takes the form: log(Aτ,jmt)\u0003 πτZjct + λ ′ τXjct + γτjc + βτjt + ετjct, where Zjct is the full set of instruments and Xjct is the set of control variables used in the main model, which include the local value of the variables underlying the Waldfogel instrument for the given county c. The γτjc are party-county ﬁxed effects, and βτjt are party-year ﬁxed effects. Because we have four endogenous advertising vari- ables, we estimate the above ﬁrst-stage model sepa- rately by tone and whether the advertisements are for the opponent or the candidate. This approach allows us to use the incumbency differences in advertising to estimate the ﬁrst-stage relationship between instru- ments and advertising. We assume heteroskedastic errors for two reasons. First, given the nature of advertising selection, the belief that the variance in the error term is constant across all DMAs by party and election timing does not seem feasible. Second, as noted in Belloni et al. (2012), using heteroskedastic errors in LASSO directly affects the convergence rates of the model, which has implications in tuning param- eters and, thereby, variable selection. Our choice is conservative in the sense that it tends to reduce the number of variables selected and decrease the efﬁciency, but ensure stronger guarantees of convergence. The LASSO IV routine automatically sets the LASSO tuning Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects 228 Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) parameter to ensure desirable convergence properties. Selection occurs only over the set of Zjct,and we enforce that the other controls are always retained. Once the set of instruments is selected from each model, we take the union of all variables and apply it to our second-stage estimation. In total, the post-LASSO method selects 58 instruments for our ﬁrst-stage model from the original 1,254. In Appendix A, we illustrate how this LASSO IV methodology is important in over- coming the many-weak-instruments problem. 5. Results In this section, ﬁrst, we discuss the estimates from our main speciﬁcation and compare them to alternative speciﬁcations drawn from the literature. Second, we assess the magnitude of the effects. Third, we present a set of robustness checks that support our speciﬁc instrumental variables strategy and the application of LASSO IV. Finally, we summarize our ﬁndings. 5.1. Parameter Estimates We begin by describing the estimates of our main speciﬁcation using the LASSO IV technique with the model of Equation (9). We then return to alternative speciﬁcations to clarify the importance of the model- ing choices we have made. Our main speciﬁcation is presented in column (1) of Table 2.We ﬁnd the negative advertising own coefﬁ- cient, αN, to be positive, but small (0.009) and insigniﬁ- cant (p > 0.1). 20 The coefﬁcient on own positive ads, αP, is much larger (0.082) and highly signiﬁcant (p < 0.01). Interpreting the coefﬁcient αN,0 (−0.041, p < 0.05), we ﬁnd that an increase in negative ads increases the outside utility. When combined with the positive αN coefﬁcient, this implies that negative ads decrease the opponent’s share. In contrast, for the coef- ﬁcient αP,0 (0.050, p < 0.05), an increase in positive ads decreases the outside utility. 21 Both of these outside good utility coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant. Thus, we ﬁnd that negative and positive ads play opposite roles in the outside good utility, but similar (directional) roles on own utility. In our context, the use of positive adver- tising not only raises the utility for the focal candidate, butalso has an expansion effectthatincreases voter turnout. In contrast, negative advertising primarily pushes down the opponent’s share to generate an advantage for the candidate. These results document that both positive and nega- tive advertising have statistically signiﬁcant effects on voters. Because of the nonlinear model and these com- plex ﬁndings, the exact magnitude of these effects requires further analysis. In the next section, we explore these magnitudes and relate them to the literature. Table B.1 in Appendix B presents the ﬁrst-stage results, including the LASSO IV-selected instruments, the F-statistics, and the Sanderson-Windmeijer F-statis- tics (Sanderson and Windmeijer 2016) thataccountfor the multiple endogenous variables and their correla- tions. Most of the selected instruments are the Waldfogel instruments. The selected instruments across the endog- enous variables differ markedly, which reﬂects the abil- ity of these instruments to isolate the tone effects. A small set of common instruments is selected for most of the advertising variables. These variables relate to the cost and Cook’s measures, which should help to identify overall advertising levels. Hence, the Waldfogel instru- ments, in particular, are important to separate the ad-tone effects. The Sanderson-Windmeijer F-statistics, ranging from 64 to 102, show the strong ability of the selected instruments to separate the different advertising variables. The Shea partial R 2 values (Shea 1997), which also take into account the correlations between multiple endogenous variables, range from 0.68 to 0.77 for the four advertising variables. Overall, these results indi- cate that our ﬁrst stage allows us to disentangle the advertising-tone effects. In Section 5.3,we further dem- onstrate that the quality of both the ﬁrst-stage results and the accuracy of our second-stage results depend on our incumbent-interaction instruments. We examine four alternative speciﬁcations to under- stand the role of speciﬁc components of our model. These alternatives (1) pool quantities across ad tones (αP \u0003 αN \u0003 α, αP,0 \u0003 αN,0 \u0003 α0,and log(AAll,jmt)\u0003 log(AP,jmt + AN,jmt)); (2) do not disentangle the turnout and relative share effects (αP,0 \u0003 αN,0 \u0003 0); (3) ignore endogeneity; and (4) use the border-discontinuity strategy of Spen- kuch and Toniatti (2018), which ignores measurement error. The model with pooled advertising is similar in spirit to the model of Gordon and Hartmann (2013), with two exceptions: We include advertising varia- bles for the own and outside good utility and use our full set of instruments (see column (2)). We ﬁnd that the own-utility coefﬁcient α is positive and sig- niﬁcant (0.052, p < 0.01), but that the outside good utility coefﬁcient α0 is negative and insigniﬁcant (−0.006, p > 0.1). This result is similar to those obtained by Gordon and Hartmann (2013) with only a single advertising coefﬁcient α (i.e., α0 \u0003 0), sug- gesting that the own-utility coefﬁcient is sufﬁcient to capture total advertising effects. Our earlier results clarify that this sufﬁciency is because, in the total advertising speciﬁcation, the opposite turnout effects for positive and negative ads are averaged to be close to zero. In column (3), we explore whether a model that sep- arates ad tone can do so with only own-utility effects. With only own-utility effects, we ﬁnd that negative advertising does not have a signiﬁcant effect (0.010, p > 0.1), whereas positive ads have a positive and sig- niﬁcant effect through own utility (0.057, p < 0.01). Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) 229 Thus, the model without the outside utility coefﬁcients incorrectly concludes that negative ads have no impact and that the only effective advertising tool is positive ads. The outside utility coefﬁcients are critical to obtain- ing an accurate picture of advertising-tone effects. In column (4), we present the ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimates, where the effect of positive advertising is attenuated and negative advertising is strengthened. The direction of the effects is consistent between the OLS and our main LASSO IV models, but the magnitudes dif- fer. These differences reﬂect the endogeneity bias. Finally, column (5) of Table 2 presents the results of applying the border-discontinuity strategy used by recent studies (Spenkuch and Toniatti 2018). We ﬁnd that none of the four advertising variables are signiﬁ- cant, and all of the point estimates are relatively small. Overall, these results differ from our LASSO IV results meaningfully and exactly in the manner expected if the estimates suffer from measurement error. Measurement error is a concern that can be addressed by our proposed methodology to disentan- gle positive and negative advertising effects. Together, these alternative speciﬁcations present evidence that all three components of our modeling approach—separating ad tones, allowing own and outside utility effects, and addressing both traditional endogeneity and measurement error—are necessary to obtain accurate estimates of the effect of positive and negative advertising. 5.2. Elasticity and Magnitude Estimates Next, we transform the parameter estimates to help better interpret the effect sizes and to compare them to results from prior work. We start by describing the elasticities, as reported in Table 3. The own elasticities represent the effect of a 1% increase in the candidate’s ads on their own vote share. The point estimates for own elasticities for negative and positive ads are 0.017 and 0.046, respectively. Thus, positive ads have nearly three times the effect of negative ads. The opponent, or cross-elasticities, are the effect of a 1% increase in the candidate’s ads on the opponent’s vote share. The cross-elasticity point estimates are −0.032 for negative ads and 0.014 for positive ads. Of these elasticities, the positive own elasticity and negative cross-elasticity are both signiﬁcantly different from zero. Consistent with the coefﬁcients described above, these elasticities indicate that negative ads depress the opponent’s shares. Analyzing the turnout and relative candidate share elasticities provides a different perspective on these results. For turnout share, negative ads have a small, insigniﬁcant turnout-demobilization effect (−0.007), Table 2.

For relative candidate share, the elasticities for both ad tones are positive, and the negative ads relative candidate share elasticity is (marginally) signiﬁcant. Thus, these elastic- ity estimates indicate that, whereas positive advertising has a larger turnout effect, negative advertising has the larger relative candidate share effect. Above, we showed that the point estimates for the positive and negative advertising elasticities have dif- ferential effects on voters. We now test whether these differences between tones are statistically signiﬁcant. Both the cross-elasticity and the turnout elasticities are signiﬁcantly different between tones (t-statistics of −2.17 and −2.66, respectively), but the own and rela- tive candidate share elasticities are not statistically distinguishable, even though the point estimates may be meaningfully different. Overall, we demonstrate that not only do ad tones have different-sized effects, but also the role of these advertising tones differs fun- damentally: Positive is for increasing turnout, and negative is for relative candidate choice. In Table 4, we measure the effect of an extra 1,000 GRPs or a one-standard-deviation (one-SD) increase in GRPs. We report effects of these ﬁxed increases in GRPs for each party separately on both relative share and turnout. These results aid the comparison with other results on political advertising effects. Relating these elasticity and effect-size estimates to the literature provides additional insights. First, we ﬁnd advertising elasticities in the range of prior politi- cal advertising studies. For example, Gordon and Hartmann (2013) and Li et al. (2019) ﬁnd elasticities of approximately 0.03. Our analysis reveals that this esti- mate averages over distinct effects across ad tones because we ﬁnd own elasticities of 0.046 and 0.017 for positive and negative advertising, respectively. Second, we compare our relative share effects to two recent papers that evaluate total advertising effects, but do not address measurement error. Our relative share-effect size from Table 4 of between 0.6% and 1.2% is larger than that of Lovett and Peress (2015), who ﬁnd a 0.46% increase, and Spenkuch and Toniatti (2018), who ﬁnd between a 0.23% and 0.32% increase. 22 Thus, our instrumental variables approach that separates ad tone appears to identify larger effect sizes. Third, our ﬁndings for turnout effects also contrast meaningfully from existing studies. Existing studies that measure turnout effects for total advertising ﬁnd no meaningful turnout effects and argue for a pre- cisely estimated null effect (Ashworth and Clinton 2007, Huber and Arceneaux 2007, Lovett and Peress 2015, Spenkuch and Toniatti 2018). In contrast, our results suggest that the total advertising null effect might be due to the fact that positive and negative advertising have opposing effects that largely wash each other out when combined into a single total advertising variable. As for results that separate ad tones, some older results that examined negative advertising (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995) ﬁnd a demobilization effect of negative advertising and others a stimulation effect (Goldstein and Freedman 2002, Shachar 2009), whereas two recent studies ﬁnd null effects for both positive and negative advertising on turnout (Spenkuch and Toniatti 2018,Wang et al. 2018). We conﬁrm the null result for negative adver- tising on turnout, but ﬁnd a signiﬁcant positive effect for positive ads. Finally, Wang et al. (2018) also separate ad-tone effects on relative share and ﬁnd a smaller elasticity estimate for negative ads (0.015) than ours (0.025). Combined with the turnout results, overall, we ﬁnd larger effect sizes than these two recent studies. Although these comparison papers use different elec- tions (Senate for Wang et al. 2018 and presidential for Spenkuch and Toniatti 2018), one common element to both studies is the use of a border-discontinuity strat- egy. As suggested by Spenkuch and Toniatti (2018), border-discontinuity strategies do not address meas- urement error in advertising exposures. Because IV strategies, in principle, do, and measurement error can lead to attenuation, our larger effect sizes might, in part, be due to this methodological difference. In summary, disentangling the tone effects reveals that ad tones affect turnout and relative candidate choice differently. Given these differences, inclusion of an advertising variable in a model of voter choice requires that the estimation approach be carefully con- structed. For instance, summing advertising across tones, as in most prior work, obscures the turnout effect due to the opposing signs on each ad-tone varia- ble. Our comparison with the ﬁndings in the literature also suggests that addressing measurement error using an instrumental variables approach might be important to getting the right magnitude of estimates. Thus, our results provide evidence for two possible explanations for why past studies have provided mixed ﬁndings on both ad-tone effects and turnout effects (Lau et al. 2007). Table 4.

Robustness Checks In this section, we test our approach to demonstrate both its robustness and its necessity to obtain accurate estimates. First, we show that our incumbency interac- tion instruments provide the critical variation to iden- tify the ad-tone effects. Second, we demonstrate that our LASSO IV results are robust to stronger and weaker approaches to the many-weak-instruments problem. Third, we examine the robustness of our estimates to potential demand spillovers from neigh- boring counties that would violate our use of the Waldfogel instruments. In this test, we add a set of control variables suggested by Li et al. (2019) and ﬁnd that this does not impact our results. The ﬁrst set of tests consider the role of the incum- bency interaction instruments in disentangling the ad-tone effects. Recall that our base instruments are designed to estimate an overall advertising effect (Li et al. 2019) and have been demonstrated to do so effec- tively. We evaluate whether these instruments are suf- ﬁcient to also disentangle ad tone—that is, we elimi- nate the incumbency interactions. Speciﬁcally, we examine instrumental variables approaches under two alternative speciﬁcations. The ﬁrst applies two- stage least squares with only the 25 base instruments (similar to Li et al. 2019). The second applies LASSO IV to the base-series instruments (the ﬂexible higher- order function of the base instruments), but again excludes the incumbency interactions. These models are presented in columns (2) and (3), respectively, of Table 5. Column (1) in Table 5 repeats the main esti- mates from our preferred speciﬁcation in Table 2. Two observations from these analyses are impor- tant to note. First, the base instruments are both strong enough to estimate a single variable (consistent with Li et al. 2019) and too weak to disentangle the more complex set of ad-tone effects. Although not reported in the table, the F-stats look reasonable (ranging from 29 to 95 for base IVs and 64 to 259 for base-series Ivs), but the Sanderson-Windmeijer F-statistics, which account for correlations in the endogenous variables, range between 0.00 and 1.12. Second, as expected given the weak ﬁrst stage, the estimates clearly suffer from multicollinearity problems and have no face validity. Hence, we ﬁnd that the identifying variation does not come from the ﬂexible function of the base instru- ments, but rather from the incumbency interactions. Our main speciﬁcation relies on the interactions of incumbency status and the base-series instruments, because without these incumbency interactions, the instruments are too weak to disentangle the ad-tone effects. The second set of tests examines how the LASSO IV uses this large set of instruments to approximate the optimal instruments, while avoiding overﬁtting noise in the ﬁrst-stage regression. As we have demonstrated, including this large set of instruments is important to disentangle the multiple ad-tone effects, but these many instruments could introduce the many-weak- instruments problem (Angrist and Pischke 2009). We show that LASSO IV avoids this problem in our setting. In column (4)ofTable 5, we estimate the second stage using limited information maximum likelihood (LIML). Although our main speciﬁcations use 2SLS, LIML is known to have better properties when address- ing the many-weak-instruments problem (Angrist and Pischke 2009). The LIML estimates change little, sug- gesting that the LASSO IV already addresses the prob- lem. This is consistent with the fact that the LASSO IV tuning parameter is set to provide theoretical bounds regarding the convergence rates (see Belloni et al. 2012). We also calibrate how severe this bias could be without the LASSO IV in Appendix A. We show that as the number of instruments included (beyond the LASSO IV instruments) increases, the estimates approach the OLS estimates, and the size of the many-weak-instru- ments bias increases, indicating that the LASSO IV is guarding against the many-weak-instruments problem. The third set of tests evaluate whether our estimates are robust to potential violations of the underlying assumptions for the Waldfogel instruments. Because the Waldfogel instruments use demand shifters of other counties in the same DMA, they require that these other counties’ characteristics do not directly enter demand. For instance, if the neighboring coun- ties’ unemployment rate affects the voting decisions in the focal county, the Waldfogel instruments would be invalid. To test whether our estimates are biased by such spillovers from the conditions in other counties Table 5.

These controls are selected to be the most likely and most important demand spillovers. Speciﬁcally, we expand on the set suggested in Li et al. (2019) and include the unemploy- ment rate, the median household income, the poverty rate, and the median employee salary. We construct summaries of these variables for two groups of coun- ties: the counties that share a border with the focal county (Neighbor) and the largest county within the same DMA as the focal county (Largest). We present results from models that include the Neighbor county variables, the Largest county variables, and the combi- nation (Both). Table 6 presents the advertising coefﬁcients from these robustness tests. We ﬁnd that the estimates are remarkably similar in direction, effect size, and statis- tical signiﬁcance to our main speciﬁcation. Because these robustness tests incorporate the counties that are most likely to exhibit demand spillovers, such spill- overs are unlikely to be contaminating our results in a meaningful way. 5.4. Discussion Our methodological approach addresses three impor- tant biases: typical endogeneity bias due to omitted variables, measurement error, and the many-weak- instruments problem. Researchers will likely face these problems when trying to disentangle ad-tone effects, especially when allowing the effects to differ for primary demand, turnout in our setting, and sec- ondary demand, relative candidate choice in our set- ting. We demonstrate that, for political advertising, separating ad tones is critical to obtaining the correct estimates, particularly for turnout, where ad-tone effects are differently signed. We also demonstrate that addressing endogeneity due to omitted variables alone may not be enough to obtain accurate estimates. Speciﬁcally, comparing our estimates against alterna- tive approaches and the literature suggests that meas- urement error might lead to underrepresentation of the size of advertising-tone effects. Disentangling these effects reveals that advertising- tone decisions involve an important trade-off. Although negative advertising is a more powerful tool to per- suade voters, it also diminishes turnout. With nega- tive advertising, the candidate gains more in terms of relative share, but the candidate’s votes might not change much, because the own effects are small for negative ads. In contrast, for positive advertising, the candidate gains less in terms of relative share than from negative advertising, but the candidate’s votes should increase more. The problem is that positive advertising also increases the turnout and, as a result, the opponent’s votes. A naive interpretation of these results would be that candidates should always go negative in their advertising. After all, races are determined by relative vote shares. However, positive advertising exhibits a different, yet important, effect compared with nega- tive advertising. Speciﬁcally, positive ads can increase turnout in geographies where the advertising candi- date has a lead. In Section 6, we use our estimates to explore this geographical targeting issue in detail. 6. Counterfactuals In this section, we seek to illustrate the importance of ad-tone strategies using a series of counterfactual sce- narios, rather than relying, as we have, on marginal effects. The ﬁrst two scenarios consider the simple cases in which all advertising is either positive (All Positive) or negative (All Negative). Although both scenarios are clearly extreme, they provide useful benchmarks to help quantify the maximum change in outcomes possible due to a drastic change in candi- dates’ ad-tone strategies. They also illustrate the impact of bans on negative advertising that countries outside of the United States have imposed (e.g., Mexico). In a second group of scenarios, we consider out- comes under unilateral best responses and in a com- petitive equilibrium. In the ﬁrst case (BR-Rep and BR-Dem), we allow one candidate to reallocate their ad budget between positive and negative ads, while holding ﬁxed the strategy of their opponent. In the competitive equilibrium (CE), both candidates simul- taneously optimize their ad-tone mix in each DMA, with full knowledge that their opponent is doing the same. The BR cases help to establish the maximum Table 6.

Comparing these cases to the CE helps to separate the relative role of competitive interaction and highlights the prisoner’s dilemma in ad tone targeting that each candidate faces (Shaffer and Zhang 1995). 23 In all the scenarios, we assume that the measured effects hold, even as the tone mix of advertising changes, and we ﬁx the ad budgets within each DMA at the observed levels. 24 We emphasize our intention to use these counter- factual simulations to help illustrate the importance of ad-tone choices. Because our setting is complex due to both the nature of substitution of toned advertising and the incentives of candidates (e.g., the Electoral College), the counterfactuals help us to transform the demand effects into more meaningful interpretations about the relative importance of each type of advertis- ing on relevant outcomes. Although we present results for both elections in our data, our discussion focuses on the 2000 election, in which voting margins were close enough for changes in advertising decisions to shift state-level electoral outcomes. In 2004, voting margins are not as close in many key battleground states, and thus we ﬁnd little scope for ad-tone decisions to change the electoral outcomes. Although counterfactual electoral outcomes do not change in 2004, the ad-tone strategies and turnout do. We ﬁrst consider the aggregate outcomes for turn- out and electoral votes. We then dig deeper into the geographic differences in strategies and outcomes in the BR and CE scenarios. In the process, we demon- strate how and why candidates would change their ad-tone decisions. 6.1. Turnout and Electoral Vote Outcomes The results of Section 5 indicate that positive ads stim- ulate turnout, and negative ads either depress or do not affect turnout. Figure 4 provides a new perspec- tive on the scale of these results in terms of feasible candidate actions. First, we examine the All Positive and All Negative simulations. In both elections, the shift from all positive ads to all negative ads decreases national turnout by around 3.3 percentage points, which represents a change of approximately 10 mil- lion votes out of the full U.S. population. In contrast, turnout changes relatively little in the scenarios where one or both candidates choose ad tone optimally (BR- Rep, BR-Dem,and CE). Across these scenarios in both years, the CE scenario generates the largest percentage increase, although the changes are more modest, rep- resenting an additional half-million to two million votes. These ﬁndings indicate that the ad-tone choices have the potential to yield important, but perhaps not dramatic, effects on turnout. Figure 5 presents the electoral outcomes under each counterfactual scenario. In the 2000 election, changes Figure 4. (Color online) Turnout Outcomes for Observed and Counterfactual Scenarios by Election Year Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects 234 Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) in ad tone can have signiﬁcant effects on the election outcomes. In the All Positive scenario, Gore takes Flor- ida, and Bush takes Wisconsin, netting Gore enough electoral votes to win the election. This suggests that depressed turnout was an important force in how Bush won the election. In contrast, the opposite effect takes place in the All Negative scenario, where Bush picks up both Oregon and New Mexico, expanding his lead. In the two scenarios in which one candidate optimizes against their opponent’s observed ad-tone decisions (BR-Rep and BR-Dem), the changes relative to the observed case are asymmetric. Whereas Bush does not secure any additional electoral votes by fur- ther optimizing ad tone, Gore swings Florida and, with it, the election. However, when both players choose ad tone optimally in the CE scenario, the elec- toral votes are unchanged from the observed. Thus, so far, our simulations demonstrate that ad-tone decisions affect turnout and can swing elec- toral outcomes in close elections, but that the effects on electoral outcomes are negligible when both candi- dates are strategic. The lack of electoral outcome changes in the CE scenario can be explained through a prisoner’s dilemma, where “targeting” a candidate’s base is akin to defecting and “not targeting” is akin to cooperating. A candidate who targets their base (“defects”) beneﬁts at the expense of their opponent. When both candidates target, neither is better off from having done so. This situation is analogous to the plight of ﬁrms engaged in competitive couponing (Shaffer and Zhang 1995), and it highlights the role of competitive interaction in shaping political advertis- ing strategies and outcomes. 6.2. Targeting Ad-Tone Policies Next, we compare actual and counterfactual ad-tone choices in the BR-Rep, BR-Dem,and CE scenarios to understand ad-tone targeting strategies and competi- tive interactions. To do this, we ﬁrst explore variation across DMAs and then focus on the close 2000 election in Florida to provide a more detailed illustration. Figure 6 presents a comparison of the actual and counterfactual negative share of advertising in each DMA for each scenario. The most prominent feature across the plots is that the counterfactual negative advertising share is decreasing in the battleground- state vote share of the advertising candidate (darker points). When battleground vote share is higher, an increase in voter turnout beneﬁts the own candidate more than the opponent. Because negative advertising has stronger effects on relative candidate share and positive advertising on turnout, candidates will tend Figure 5. (Color online) Electoral Vote Outcomes for Observed and Counterfactual Scenarios by Candidate and Election Year Note. The states that the electoral vote outcomes would change in the counterfactual scenarios are shown for each scenario with the number of electoral votes in parentheses. Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) 235 to use negative advertising where they are weaker and positive advertising where they are stronger. This feature reﬂects the underlying difference in the role of positive and negative advertising. A second feature apparent in Figure 6 is the similar- ity in ad tones of the BR scenarios and the CE scenario within party. The similarity suggests that there is lim- ited competitive response in the targeting strategies when both optimize. That is, the targeting strategies in the CE scenario are driven by dominant targeting strategies, rather than competitive interaction, per se. This aggregate view of strategies does not highlight changes in tone choices and outcomes within-state. We use the case of Florida in 2000 to illustrate these more granular changes. Figure 7 displays the negative advertising share by party in the actual and counter- factual scenarios (Democrat in the ﬁrst row, (a)–(c), and Republican in the second row, (d)–(f)). Actual ad tone exhibits relatively limited variation within the state (Figure 7,(a)and (d)). In contrast, each of the coun- terfactual scenarios have much larger variation in ad tone (Figure 7,(b), (c), (e), and (f)). The counterfactual targeting strategies lead each candidate to emphasize negative ver- sus positive ads in distinct geographies. They increase positive ads to increase votes among supporters in the candidate’s stronghold counties—Northern Florida for the Republican and Southeastern Florida for the Demo- crats—and negative ads to decrease opponent votes in the opponent’s strongholds. Figure 8 displays county-level actual vote shares and counterfactual relative vote changes, deﬁned as the changes in differences of the two party votes. This shows that the counterfactual vote changes are mostly concentrated where the candidate already has an advantage. As a result, the gains each candidate gen- erates from optimizing their own ad tone are pro- duced in distinct locations (Figure 8,(b) and (d)) and diminished when both optimize (Figure 8(c)). These results help to clarify the aggregate ﬁnding reported earlier in Figure 5. When the Democrat can- didate is the only one that optimizes, the Democrat candidate takes Florida in 2000. However, when both candidates optimize, there is little change in electoral outcome. These local counterfactual results reveal that Figure 6. (Color online) BR-Rep, BR-Dem,and CE: Actual vs. Counterfactual Negative Ad Share by DMA Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects 236 Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) candidates shift local votes in their favor, but that the magnitude of these shifts for both candidates offset each other to create no meaningful relative share changes at the state level. 6.3. Summary This section adds to the evidence in Section 5 by cali- brating the estimated effects to the magnitude of ad-tone choices that are feasible. We ﬁnd that ad-tone decisions matter to turnout and electoral outcomes. For turnout effects, ad tone can have an important, but moderate, impact. If candidates were forced to use all positive advertising instead of all negative, the turnout would increase by nearly 10 million voters. However, if candidates behave in their own self- interest in targeting ad-tone decisions, then the turn- out impact is much smaller. For electoral outcomes, ad-tone choices can be conse- quential in close elections, but are unlikely to shift the outcome in a less competitive election. If one candidate is sophisticated (optimal) and the other is not, there is potential for the sophisticated candidate to gain electoral votes. However, if both candidates are sophisticated, this potential is erased, much like a prisoner’s dilemma. Based on our ﬁxed budget simulations, optimal ad-tone strategies appear to be much more ﬁnely targeted than what candidates currently do. In particu- lar, this targeting should focus on shifting positive ads toward the geographies where the candidate has more of a relative share advantage in order to encourage turn- out among the candidate’s base. However, the inverse is also true—candidates should target negative ads at the opponent’s strongholds in order to discourage the oppo- nent’svotersfrom turning out. Campaigns should not use only negative advertise- ments because, in some counties, their candidate might have a sufﬁcient voter advantage to make the beneﬁts from positive advertising (more total votes) exceed those of negative advertising (higher share of votes). This beneﬁt of positive advertising can arise when a state is covered by multiple DMAs. If one DMA has higher relative share, then the positive ads can increase the votes, and vote share for the total state. 7. Conclusion This paper highlights the importance of disentangling the effects of positive versus negative advertisements. Extant research demonstrates that negative stimuli are processed differently than positive stimuli (Ito et al. 1998, Ito and Cacioppo 2000), which suggests that the ad tones may have differential effects. Yet, current Figure 7. (Color online) Actual and Counterfactual Negative Ad Shares Notes. Ad data are missing for counties colored in white. We hold ad tones in those counties ﬁxed.

Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) 237 studies on ad tone in the political advertising litera- ture have shown either no effect or mixed effects on election outcomes. This paper attempts to resolve this question. Our approach to disentangle ad-tone effects relies on augmenting the utility framework for a can- didate, incorporating incumbency-interaction instru- ments, and leveraging machine learning to enhance our estimation strategy. Prior studies using standard discrete-choice models constrain the sign of advertising’s effects on relative shares and turnout to be identical. We instead allow each ad tone to have distinct effects on a candidate’s share and the outside good’s utility. We use a combi- nation of instruments to identify advertising levels and show that interactions with incumbency status allow us to disentangle ad tones. We use a LASSO IV method (Belloni et al. 2012) to select and retain instru- ments in our ﬁrst-stage estimation to address the potential problem of many weak instruments. We ﬁnd that both types of advertising contribute to the overall success of an election campaign, but play different roles. Positive advertising is shown to stimu- late voters to vote and, thus, increase the overall turn- out rate of an area. In contrast, negative advertising increases a candidate’s relative vote share at the cost of suppressing turnout slightly. To highlight the importance of our estimation approach, we perform a series of robustness checks. Failing to account for both advertising tones results in muted turnout effects. Ignoring endogeneity of adver- tising or the many-instruments problem causes the researcher to falsely attribute the effects of positive ads to negative ads. If we employ the border-discontinuity strategy to estimate ad effects, which does not address measurement error in ad exposures, the estimated effect of both ad tones are understated. Finally, we demonstrate that we require the incumbency interac- tion instruments in order to disentangle ad-tone effects. We end this paper by performing a series of partial- equilibrium counterfactual simulations to highlight the importance of ad-tone choices in politics. We start by forcing all advertising to be either positive or nega- tive. In the simulation where negative advertising is banned, turnout increases by millions of voters, and, more importantly, the outcome of close political races changes. Next, we allow candidates to optimize their ad-tone choices and examine the election results. In a scenario where one candidate optimizes their ad-tone choice, we ﬁnd that the outcome of close races in an election can change. However, if both campaigns optimize simultaneously, any advantage gained from Figure 8. (Color online) Actual Vote Share and Counterfactual Relative Vote Changes Notes.

Gordon et al.: Disentangling Ad Tone Effects 238 Management Science, 2023, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 220–243, © 2022 The Author(s) optimizing based on ad tone is negated. One assump- tion underlying our counterfactual analysis is that can- didates’ advertising budgets are ﬁxed within each DMA to those in the data. Future research can explore how relaxing this assumption may change the overall outcomes. For example, we speculate that if candidates were allowed to fully reoptimize their budgets and tone choices across DMAs, budgets would further increase in regions where a candidate has a slight advantage in close, battleground states. Within these DMAs, we expect to see more money placed into posi- tive advertising in DMAs where the candidate has big vote-share advantages. If one advertising tone were to be banned and budgets were reoptimized, we would expect to see reduced advertising budgets overall, as candidates need to settle for less efﬁcient advertising spend. Future research examining these hypothesized counterfactual budget changes could prove fruitful in further exploring how advertising tone impacts politi- cal outcomes. In our setting, we ﬁnd that measuring ad-tone effects requires modeling both primary and secondary demand effects, so that the roles of positive and nega- tive advertising are able to differ for turnout and can- didate choice. More broadly, measuring the effects of advertising content differences may require model extensions to accommodate how content affects con- sumers differently. As in our setting, estimating ad-tone effects adds to the usual challenges of adver- tising measurement, already made difﬁcult due to endogeneity bias arising from omitted variables and measurement error. Future work may further leverage the IV-based approach that we present or may need to identify additional sources of exogenous variation with which to measure ad effects. In light of the Citi- zens United ruling, another route for research would be to understand how the ruling impacts candidates’ and parties’ fundraising and advertising strategies. 25 Although candidates still use essentially the same techniques and appeals within their advertisements, they have recognized that the purpose of some adver- tising is speciﬁcally to generate fundraising contribu- tions for future efforts, as opposed to advertising only to inﬂuence the vote.

All remaining errors are the authors’. Appendix A. Calibration of the Many-Weak- Instruments Bias We consider how much bias from the many-weak-instru- ments problem the LASSO IV addresses in our applica- tion. Figure A.1 presents the point estimates for the four focal coefﬁcients across a variety of model estimations, averaging 100 bootstrap samples. On the far right (OLS), we present the estimates for the model assuming exoge- nous advertising. Second from the right are estimates from a model that includes all 1,254 of the potential instruments constructed from the costs and Waldfogel IVs (All_IV). These estimates are almost identical to those from OLS, which is expected given the near-perfect ﬁrst- stage ﬁt provided by the large number of instruments. Along with the differences between the OLS and LASSO IV point estimates, this result demonstrates the extremity of the many-weak-instruments bias. Although generally speaking to the value of the LASSO IV in many- instruments cases, this ﬁnding also suggests that one should be cautious, speciﬁcally, in using the many avail- able Waldfogel instruments without the LASSO IV in light of potential for many weak instruments. The far left esti- mates are for the LASSO IV model. Between the LASSO IV estimates and the All_IV estimates, we provide a sequence of estimates intended to illustrate the many- weak-instruments bias in more detail. Speciﬁcally, we esti- mate the model including both the instruments selected from the LASSO IV and a random subset of the remaining instruments. We randomly bootstrap the subset of the remaining instruments 100 times, averaging over these estimates. The x-axis indicates the percentage of the potential instruments that are included beyond the LASSO IV instruments (5%, 7%, 10%, etc.). As this percentage increases, we are increasing the size of the many-weak- instruments bias. This sequence of estimates rapidly approaches the OLS and All_IV estimates, indicating that the LASSO IV is guarding against the many-weak-instru- ments problem. Appendix B. First-Stage Results Table B.1 presents the model statistics, as well as the selected variables from the ﬁrst stage (variable key can be found in Figure A.1.

Most of the instruments that are retained are the Waldfogel instruments. In total, of the 58 instruments, 45 con- tain at least one variable in the interaction that is Waldfogel, and 13 contain only cost variables. All but one of the selected variables (“age45”) are interactions. More broadly, the selected IVs across the endogenous variables differ markedly, which reﬂects the ability of these instruments to isolate the tone effects. A small set of common instruments is selected for most of the advertis- ing variables. These variables relate to the cost and Cook’s measures, which should help to identify overall advertis- ing levels. Hence, our results require the Waldfogel instruments, especially in order to separate the tones. Appendix C. Objective for Counterfactual Equilibrium Denote the ﬁxed advertising budget in DMA m and elec- tion year t for candidate j ∈{R, D}, Ajmt. Denote θjmt as the share of all ads that are positive. The total amount of pos- itive and negative ads are then calculated as AP,jmt \u0003 θjmtAjmt and AN,jmt \u0003(1 − θjmt)Ajmt, respectively. Candidate j chooses θjmt to maximize the vote difference between own and opponent candidate in the most competitive part (state) of the DMA, denoted as S(m). 26 Formally, for each DMA m and election t, candidate j solves the following maximization problem given Ajmt: max θjmt∈[0, 1] ΔVotemt \u0003 ∑ c∈S(m) VAPct (sjct(θjmt, θ−jmt) − s−jct(θjmt, θ−jmt)), (C.1) where sjct is candidate j’s vote share in county c and elec- tion t, which is a function of ad-tone choices of both candi- dates.

(2018, p. 140). 3 The incident, now known as “Corngate,” prompted parent company MillerCoors to sue AB InBev for false and misleading advertising (http:// fortune.com/2019/03/22/millercoors-sues-budweiser-corngate/). 4 Additional examples of negative advertising can be found at https://adage.com/article/agency-viewpoint/negative-ads-positive- brand/295692. 5 See also this article written by Mark Penn at http://ideas.time. com/2012/05/23/the-case-for-negative-campaign-ads-2/. 6 Note that such effects could arise from the content itself, the process- ing of the content, or other postexposure psychological phenomena. 7 This approach has some similarities to the methodology of Ander- son et al. (2016) and Liu et al. (2014). In Anderson et al. (2016), the competitors’ comparative ads are allowed to influence the quality of commercial products. In Liu et al. (2014), the total quantity of marketing efforts of all brands in the market are included in a given brand’s utility to quantify category expansion or share effects. 8 Mexico banned negative political ads after an especially contentious 2006 presidential election (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/ world/worldview/a-presidential-election-without-attack-ads-hint-look- south-way-south/article4103213/). 9 On this last point, however, it is difficult to determine whether these differences can be attributed to the different methodology or the fact that we study elections for different offices. Wang et al. (2018) find across their analyses that negative ads are effective in increasing two-party vote share, but the significance of this effect varies depending on the model specification. In contrast, their point estimates on positive ad effects are small and insignificant. Our results differ in two ways. First, we find that positive ads increase both vote share and turnout. Second, whereas their results imply that negative ads increase turnout in some specifications, we find that negative ads decrease voter preferences for the opponent can- didate and slightly decrease turnout. 10 https://elections.wisc.edu/wisconsin-advertising-project/. 11 A GRP is a standard measure of advertising representing the number of percentage points of the target market that is reached. Multiple exposures are added together. Table B.2.

We have tested other additive values and find that our results are robust. Relatedly, we note that the model is more general and doesn’t require diminishing returns to identify the advertising effects. 13 Note that a random coefficients logit (RCL) model can allow such a relaxation, but the model requires more parameters and specific correlations in the unobservable heterogeneity to produce oppo- sitely signed turnout and relative share effects. For instance, one can obtain a positive relative share elasticity and negative turnout elasticity under the following condition: Voters who prefer the can- didate must dislike negative advertising by the candidate a lot, and voters who dislike the candidate like negative advertising by the candidate. Although this implies it is possible to relax the sign con- straint, Liu et al. (2014) argue that the RCL does not provide suffi- cient relaxation of the invariant proportion of substitution. To achieve similar results as our specification, the RCL model requires an additional five parameters, compared with two additional parameters in our model. 14 Note that the estimate of ατ,0 is the same in either formulation by Equations (1) and (8) or Equation (9). 15 This consistency and the nature of diminishing returns leads us to prefer this specification to other similar specifications. We have tested one in which we use the log sum of advertising of both par- ties as an outside good. The nonnested Vuong test (p > 0.9) suggests no significant difference in model fit. 16 An alternative approach is proposed in Gillen et al. (2019), which allows selection of instruments, as well as random coefficients. As evi- denced by prior work (Gordon and Hartmann 2013, Gillen et al. 2019), in our empirical setting, random coefficients are difficult to identify with the available information, even with a single advertising variable. As a result, we focus on the approach described herein. 17 The CMAG estimates are approximations of actual spending by advertisers, rather than observed spending. The SQAD measures are noisy because they are quarterly aggregates and measured for commercial advertisers—not political ad buyers, who likely pay dif- ferent prices. The CMAG data are the only data available with extensive positive/negative coding of advertising. 18 This judgement is partly based on a comparison with the data source and measurement error analysis found in section 6.2 and appendix D.2 of Shapiro et al. (2021). Their main advertising varia- ble is likely measured with less error than our own due to their access to direct exposure measures, and so any resulting estimate of the effect of measurement error could provide an approximate lower bound for our analysis. Their measurement error robustness checks, presented in table 6 of Online Appendix D, provide a range of mean estimates between 0.0315 and 0.0171, with 0.0233 being their preferred estimate. This range suggests that about 35% error could arise due to measurement in their setting. 19 As Li et al. (2019) note, this assumption can be relaxed to allow some geographies in the same DMA to have a direct effect on demand—that is, demand spillovers. We present a robustness check in Section 5.3 to address this possibility and find that this issue does not materially impact our results. 20 Note in the specification where advertising affects the outside good, the effect of negative advertising on own utility is the differ- ence between the parameters αN and αN,0. With these estimates, ˜αN \u0003 0:009 + 0:041 \u0003 0:050, which is marginally significant (χ 2 \u0003 2:93, p < 0.087). 21 This finding is similar in spirit to those found in Shapiro (2018), where product ads are shown to have a positive category spillover effect. 22 Both models use linear specifications for advertising. The reported increase in Lovett and Peress (2015) is 3.1% for a 6,800 GRP increase, which we linearly translate to a 1,000 GRP increase. The reported increase in Spenkuch and Toniatti (2018) is 0.49% to 0.67% change for a 2,100 GRP increase by the Democrat, which we translate linearly to a 1,000 GRP increase. 23 In the BR-Rep, BR-Dem, and CE scenarios, each candidate seeks to maximize the difference in votes. This simplified objective is consis- tent with the goal of winning the election in the presence of ex ante voting outcome uncertainty. It also captures the key trade-off between getting more votes and getting higher vote share. For DMAs that cover multiple states, we focus on the vote difference for the state facing the closest competition. In the CE scenario, we solve the system of first-order conditions for the two candidates (see Appendix B for details). Because the CE counterfactual could be subject to multiple equilibria, we tested 30 different starting points for each market. Of these cases, only 2% found multiple equi- libria, and none of these were qualitatively relevant changes. 24 A full solution that reoptimizes the ad budgets across DMAs is beyond the scope of the current paper. Not only is this problem extremely computationally demanding, but it requires data coverage of the full set of geographies, something unavailable in our data. For coun- ties wherewedo not observeadvertising data, weimplicitly assume that actions and outcomes are unchanged in our counterfactuals. 25 Interestingly, an analysis at Opensecrets.org (Biersack 2018) con- cluded that Citizens United resulted in only “modest” changes in overall spending. 26 We solve for the optimal θjmt for each state-DMA combination. If the DMA does not overlap with any battleground state, we take the population-weighted average of the optimal θjmt. If the DMA over- laps with battleground state(s), we take the optimal θjmt from the most competitive state.
