{"path":"lit/lit_sources/EPEX22basicsPowMkt.pdf","text":"Basics of the Power Market Electricity - a unique commodity Electricity is an essential good in our society. It not only provides us with light and warmth, but it is also a basic element of any industrial activity. The liberalisation of power markets in the 1990s was the starting point of the creation of an Internal European Energy market achieving security of supply, competitive prices and enhanced services to customers. Within this European Internal Energy Market, a large variety of companies organise the production, trading, marketing, transmission and supply of electricity; within the framework of appropriate regulation. Electricity is a particular commodity that cannot easily be stored. Moreover, the frequency on the electricity grid needs to remain stable at all times, meaning users of the transmission grids must be balanced in real-time between their resources and consumption of power. This makes the short-term spot power market an essential tool to balance the overall system. And since the European spot power markets are coupled, they help to provide electricity where it is needed and when it is needed, even across borders. ¬† Power Exchanges organise trading and operate markets Power Exchanges o\u0000er a trading platform to their exchange members. The members connect to this platform and submit orders for buying and/or selling power, which are registered in an order book. These orders re\u0000ect supply and demand for a speci\u0000c market area at a certain moment in time. Based on the order book, Power Exchanges calculate a market price (scroll down for more details on the price calculation). Since the trades result from a large, open and transparent competition between the orders of the Exchange members, they re\u0000ect the best information available at the time under the market conditions. They are hence the most reliable prices available for electricity in short-term delivery. By matching supply and demand, Power Exchanges ensure a transparent and reliable price formation, and they make sure that the traded electricity is delivered and paid. Markets organised by Power Exchanges are optional, anonymous and accessible to all participants satisfying admission requirements. In opposition to direct bilateral transactions, called Over-the-Counter (OTC) trades, the organised market place operated by an Exchange has various advantages such as pooling of liquidity, transparency, emergence of a single reference price, payment and delivery security, anonymity and the application of Market Rules. ¬† E\u0000cient and liquid wholesale markets are a prerequisite for competitive retail markets, and hence an advantage for the \u0000nal consumer. The larger supply and demand, the more relevant and competitive the price signal. Therefore, increasing the liquidity of the European market is a means to maximise social welfare for all European citizens. üìûüë§ 12/17/24, 12:15 A M B asics of the Power Market | E PE X SPOT https://www.epexspot.com/en/basicspowermarket 1/6 Electricity crosses borders, increasing social welfare European Market Coupling, to which EPEX SPOT has been a major contributor, allows for electricity to \u0000ow freely across borders. Electricity is distributed more e\u0000ciently all over the continent, because \u0000ows follow price signals (see PCR). The e\u0000ciency of cross-border trading, therefore, has an impact on social welfare. EPEX SPOT provides such instruments in both the Day-Ahead and Intraday segments, via the European Single Day-Ahead and Single Intraday Coupling, ensuring transparent and secure transactions in all our market areas. ¬† Factsheet - What is a Power Exchange? ¬† Clearing and Settlement Once a trade is completed on the platform of an exchange, the transaction is cleared and settled. Clearing ensures the proper ful\u0000lment of each contract concluded or registered on the exchange. In its position as the central counterparty, the clearing house steps in a\u0000er a trade has been concluded, becoming the contractual partner for both buyer and seller. In doing so the clearing house ensures the ful\u0000lment of each trade (payment and delivery) and mitigates the counterparty risk. All transactions on EPEX SPOT are cleared and settled by ECC, the leading clearing house for energy and commodity products in Europe. ECC conducts all payment \u0000ows between the seller and the buyer (\u0000nancial settlement) and guarantees the delivery of the traded electricity (physical settlement). As a clearing house specialising in physical commodity markets, ECC works together with a network of Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and registries, supporting various market coupling projects for connecting the European energy markets. ¬† Day-Ahead and Intraday ‚Äì the backbone of the European spot market EPEX SPOT operates the most liquid Day-Ahead and Intraday markets in Europe. Both markets ful\u0000l di\u0000erent purposes and are indispensable links of the energy value chain. The Day-Ahead market is operated through a blind auction which takes place once a day, all year round. All hours of the following day are traded in this auction. The orders are logged in by the market participants before the order book closes at 12:00 CET (10:20 for Great Britain and 11:00 for Switzerland). Then the algorithm is launched. Market participants send two types of orders in the auction: Firstly, orders for each delivery period that re\u0000ect their willingness to buy or sell, in volume, for all price ticks between the minimum and maximum prices of the auction. Secondly, block orders linking several delivery periods together. Based on the buy-orders, the Power Exchange establishes a demand curve, based on the sell-orders it establishes a supply curve, referred to as aggregated curves, both for each hour of the following day. The market clearing price (MCP), which re\u0000ects supply and demand, lies at the intersection of both curves. As a result of this order matching, the Power Exchange determines trades which are legally binding agreements to purchase or sell a determined quantity of electricity to a de\u0000ned delivery area for the matched (or ‚Äúcleared‚Äù) price. There is one price, the market clearing price or MCP, that is determined for each delivery period and that applies to all buyers and sellers. This price is never higher than the purchase price \u0000xed by the buyer or lower than the sale price o\u0000ered by the seller. All buyers who submitted volumes at a price higher than the MCP are executed for these volumes and pay the MCP, and all sellers who submitted volumes priced lower than the MCP are executed for these volumes and receive the MCP. In the auction, buyers and sellers are not matched one-to-one. There is an overall executed buy volume that is equal to an overall executed sell volume for each delivery period.An auction has the advantage of gathering liquidity at one point in time while o\u0000ering full transparency on the traded Market Clearing Volumes (MCV) and creating a level playing \u0000eld. Exchange members use the auction to sell and buy the largest part of the produced/ needed electricity. ¬† Clearing at ECC ‚Äì Want to know how clearing works?Clearing at ECC ‚Äì Want to know how clearing works? üìûüë§ 12/17/24, 12:15 A M B asics of the Power Market | E PE X SPOT https://www.epexspot.com/en/basicspowermarket 2/6 The Intraday market o\u0000ers the possibility to trade even more in the short term. Market participants can either trade continuously, on the Intraday continuous market, or via Intraday auctions. On the Intraday continuous market, participants trade 24 hours a day, with delivery on the same day. As soon as a buy- and sell-order match, the trade is executed. Electricity can be traded up to 5 minutes before delivery and through hourly, half-hourly or quarter-hourly contracts. As this allows for a high level of \u0000exibility, members use the Intraday market to make last minute adjustments and to balance their positions closer to real time. Cross-border trading is essential in Intraday trading, and European Intraday markets are connected via the Single Intraday Coupling (SIDC). Intraday auctions are also available on the Intraday market, they allow for a pooling of liquidity at a certain point in time and deliver a price reference for electricity delivery on the same or on the following day, depending on the auction timing. ¬† Factsheet - What is the EU Internal Market for Electricity? Merit order and marginal cost - the price formation process The electricity bills of any European end-consumer consist of many components that vary between countries. One component is always the price for power. This price for power is based on prices on the wholesale spot electricity markets, which are operated by EPEX SPOT. The wholesale power market brings together producers that sell electricity, and suppliers that buy electricity, to then have it delivered to their customers. Marginal cost and merit order Price formation on the EU Day-Ahead spot power market is based on marginal cost, which indicates how much it costs a producer to generate one additional MWh of electricity. Power plants are put on the market by the order of their marginal production cost, starting with the least expensive up to the most expensive plant, activated in that order to meet demand. The last activated plant sets the price. All producers are paid the same price ‚Ç¨/MWh for the same product: electricity. The least expensive marginal production costs are usually renewables, the most expensive plants are gas and coal plants. In addition, the use of coal and gas generation in Europe needs to be covered by CO2 certi\u0000cates, creating a direct connection between electricity pricing and CO2 pricing, as well as prices for coal and gas. The marginal cost pricing system Factsheet - How do electricity prices come about? The power market as a barometer Unlike other commodities, electricity cannot be stored e\u0000ciently. This makes the electricity market an essential tool to balance the overall system and ensure that supply matches demand at all times. The Day-ahead and Intraday power markets operated by EPEX SPOT are physical markets. Unlike on \u0000nancial markets, every single transaction on the power spot market leads to a physical delivery of electricity. The electricity price is determined by EPEX¬†SPOT 24/7, and for the whole of Europe. The electricity price surge we have been observing since Autumn 2021 has di\u0000erent causes, some of which are: The prices of the power market fully re\u0000ect these challenges that developed in the past two years.¬†Instead of ‚Äúbreaking the barometer‚Äù by interfering in the price formation process, it is crucial to address the¬†real¬†causes of the price surge while taking measures to protect the vulnerable end-consumer. The EPEX SPOT Day-Ahead auction is integrated into the Single Day-Ahead Coupling (SDAC) which encompasses 27 countries across Europe, excluding Great Britain and Switzerland. The pan-European Single Intraday Coupling encompasses 24 countries, excluding Great Britain and Switzerland. ensures that demand is always met at the¬†lowest possible cost, because cheap producers are dispatched \u0000rst. enables all generators to always cover their costs, ensuring¬†security of supply. If producers know they can always cover they cost, then they have an incentive to run their units when they are needed. incentivises generators to o\u0000er their production at a price not higher than their actual operating costs. If they did o\u0000er electricity at a higher price than their true marginal cost, then they would risk not to sell at all, because orders of other producers who bid at their true marginal cost would be executed to meet demand. High¬†global gas¬†demand¬†as a consequence of the post-covid economic pickup Low supply, meaning low wind, lower-than-usual gas storage, hydro-reservoirs levels, and nuclear availability High CO2¬†prices, that drove up further the costs of ramping up conventional power plants. üìûüë§ 12/17/24, 12:15 A M B asics of the Power Market | E PE X SPOT https://www.epexspot.com/en/basicspowermarket 3/6 The Wholesale Market and renewables Initiated by the European Union‚Äôs 20/20/20 policyand driven by subsequent initiatives such as the Clean Energy Package or the EU Green Deal, renewable electricity capacity has increased signi\u0000cantly in the past 10 years. This growth, fuelled by political, economic and environmental imperatives, will see renewables continue to play an increasing role in the European energy mix over the next decade. The European Commissioner for Energy, Kadri Simson, declared in 2023 that, in order to stay on track to meet the Green Deal targets, the EU needs to triple its renewable deployment. Global installed renewable capacity has pushed through the 300 GW mark for the \u0000rst time in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency. These trends pose challenges for energy markets due to the speci\u0000c characteristics of renewable generation, notably intermittency and daily ramping increase and decrease. ¬† This means short term power trading needs to adapt to the speci\u0000c characteristics of renewables. Over the past years, EPEX SPOT‚Äôs markets have demonstrated their suitability to integrate additional renewable volumes whilst minimising price impacts. EPEX SPOT‚Äôs coupled Day-Ahead markets have proven to be a key tool for limiting the potential price impacts of renewable energy. By fully optimising the use of interconnectors, national surpluses and de\u0000cits are mitigated in the coupled markets, providing more resilience against supply and demand disturbances. Day to day or seasonal variations in renewable production can be counterbalanced between zones, and converging prices smooth both positive and negative peaks. Besides Market Coupling, product granularity plays an important role in the integration of renewables. EPEX SPOT‚Äôs Intraday markets provide an e\u0000ective solution for integrating intermittent supply, enabling producers and consumers to balance their positions close to real time. Energy can be traded up to 5 minutes ahead of delivery, which provides a level of \u0000exibility welcomed by market players who trade both renewable and conventional energy. On several markets, 15-minute and 30-minute contracts are available, providing greater \u0000exibility to handle the daily ramping e\u0000ects of renewable production and contributing to a more balanced market. In addition to this, local and coupled Intraday auctions are available in several market areas. Dealing with high electricity prices The market design is not to be blamed for high electricity prices, the price information is a message that signals tension in the electricity system of supply and demand. To reduce the occurrence of high electricity prices, decision- and policy-makers should focus on the following: If governments suddenly change the rules on how prices are set, this would freeze all investments in renewable generation and as a consequence decrease security of supply.¬†Furthermore, consumers should have su\u0000cient information to choose their preferred level of risk exposure and¬†be enabled to cover this risk. The pan-European electricity market is the most e\u0000cient one in the world build up over more than 20 years and it acts as a model for other regions. EPEX SPOT is contributing to the well- functioning of the market and facilitates the energy transition by continuously working on innovations.

High electricity prices - Q&A Green power needs to be e\u0000ciently integrated into the wholesale market in order to reach the \u0000nal consumer. To¬†further integrate¬†the European electricity market, as it is key for Europe‚Äôs energy security.

Tailor- made trading solutions to achieve this already exist on all EPEX¬†SPOT markets. To allow¬†reliable and transparent price signals¬†to emerge, to trigger investments in decarbonised technologies. Price signals should also help electricity consumers to adjust their consumption behaviour. To¬†monitor measures¬†such as a revenue cap on inframarginal technologies or a price cap on gas for bidding in the power market. Such measures do, theoretically, not directly impact the price formation process on the wholesale market, but if and how they have an indirect impact on the e\u0000ciency of the market highly depends on the details of their implementation. To¬†protect vulnerable consumers¬†‚Äì such measures are indispensable. They should, however, not undermine the e\u0000ciency of the wholesale market, because market distortion would in the end generate costs that would be passed on to the end-consumer. The European Commission has developed and implemented several proposals that provide relief for end- consumers, such as the REPower EU package The market is not failing. It re\u0000ects the fundamentals of demand and supply as accurately as possible. In these times of turbulence, the market is providing strong price signals.¬†The move away from fossil fuels has become even more pressing in the recent geo-political context. Transparent and reliable price signals that correctly re\u0000ect market fundamentals are the best tool to trigger e\u0000cient production and consumption decisions and to drive investments in the right generation capacities. Measures to regulate or structure the market would not preserve this investment signal but distort it, necessarily leading to a standstill of the much needed transition.

Should we abandon it because of the crisis? ÔîÄ Are we paying also for the energy bills of our European neighbors? ÔîÄ Why are electricity prices volatile at times? ÔîÄ Is the Iberian model a better option to regulate the electricity price? Shouldn‚Äôt we just extend this model to the whole of Europe? ÔîÄ Should we change our pricing model from pay-as-clear to pay-as-bid? ÔîÄ Negative power spot prices occur when there is an excess of production compared to consumption. These prices signal the need to decrease production and/or increase consumption. Negative prices appear with a high amount of renewables feed-in, low consumption and a high in\u0000exible power generation. In\u0000exible power sources such as lignite or nuclear plants can‚Äôt be shut down and restarted. Renewables support schemes also impact the occurrence of negative prices. Although renewable production has zero marginal cost, in case of a support scheme such as market premium, premium producers are incentivised to maintain the production unless the price goes below the premium. On wholesale markets, electricity prices are driven by supply and demand, which in turn are determined by several factors such as Prices fall with high production and low demand, signalling generators to reduce output to avoid overloading the grid. On all Day-Ahead and all Intraday markets of EPEX SPOT, electricity prices can fall below zero. In some circumstances, negative prices allow the power system to deal with a sudden oversupply of energy and to send appropriate market signals to reduce production or increase consumption. In this case, thermal producers have to compare their costs of stopping and restarting their plants with the costs of selling their energy at a negative price (which means paying instead of receiving money). If their production means are \u0000exible enough, they will stop producing for this period of time which will prevent or bu\u0000er the negative price on the wholesale market and ease the tension on the grid. Renewable generators have similar incentives in case they don't receive a subsidy scheme (i.e. a feed-in-tari\u0000 or a premium when they produce). What are negative prices and why do they occur? ÔîÄ climate conditions (e.g. temperature levels during di\u0000erent seasons), seasonal factors (e.g. bank holidays or major events) or consumption behaviour (e.g. weekday vs. weekends). Are negative prices a theoretical concept or is the buyer really paid for buying electricity? ÔîÄ How o\u0000en do they occur? ÔîÄ Aren‚Äôt negative prices threatening producers' businesses? ÔîÄ Are negative power spot prices unfavourable to renewable assets and therefore block green investment? ÔîÄ Are there any means to so\u0000en or prevent negative prices? ÔîÄ Should governments stop negative power spot prices from happening? Is it the fault of the merit-order? ÔîÄ Since when do negative power spot prices exist?
