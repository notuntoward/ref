Ridout, Erika Franklin Fowler, and Michael M. Franz ABSTRACT We examine how campaigns use advertising in the current digital era – and how spending decisions depend on the stage of the campaign and the particular goal being pursued. Our investigation relies on a database consisting of thousands of ads placed on Facebook by 24 different U.S. Senate campaigns in 2018. In the end, we find that campaigns pursue a large number of goals in their Facebook advertising and that the sequence of the campaign has a major influence on the goals pursued. KEYWORDS political advertising; campaigns; Facebook; social media The Influence of Goals and Timing: How Campaigns Deploy Ads on Facebook Political campaigns are strategic in almost every- thing they do, including in their use of political advertising. For decades, especially in federal cam- paigns, that has primarily meant decisions about the use of broadcast television advertising, but the intro- duction of digital and social media into electoral politics has made campaigns’ strategic choices more complex in at least three ways. First, and most basically, the ability now to buy digital adver- tising means campaigns must make decisions about how many advertising dollars to allocate to digital versus television (not to mention radio, billboards, and direct mailers). Second, thanks to the affor- dances of digital platforms, campaigns can pursue many more goals with digital than they can pursue with television, giving them choices to make about which goals to pursue as well. Moreover, these deci- sions are made in the context of a campaign that has its own temporal logic; thus, decisions about the proper medium for pursuing particular campaign goals depend also on the stage of the campaign. We focus on campaigns’ use of Facebook, the dominant platform for digital political advertising (Kreiss, Lawrence, & McGregor, 2018; Wesleyan Media Project, 2020). We ask, how do strategic cam- paigns use paid advertising on Facebook? And how do allocations of resources to the platform depend on both the goals of specific messages and the stage of the campaign? We suggest that the logic underlying these calculations might be somewhat different than theories developed in the television age, and thus we develop and test a theory for the digital age. Our investigation relies upon a database consist- ing of thousands of ads placed on Facebook by 24 different U.S. Senate campaigns in 2018 – and sup- plemental information from Pathmatics, a market intelligence firm, on when those ads were seen. In the end, we find that campaigns pursue a large num- ber of goals beyond persuasion in their Facebook advertising and that the stage of the campaign has a considerable influence on the goals pursued through digital advertising on the platform. Use of Social Media in Campaigns Research on the use of social media platforms in campaigns is growing rapidly (see Stromer-Galley, 2019 for an overview). Much of this research focuses on unpaid messaging, such as the content of videos posted on YouTube (Ridout, Fowler, Branstetter, & Borah, 2015) or what is found on their official Facebook pages.1 For instance, Borah (2014) examined the 2012 presidential campaign, looking at candidates’ posts, finding a more aggres- sive tone from Romney than Obama. In a follow-up piece, Borah (2016) looks at the 2008 and 2012 U.S. presidential elections and examines the frequency of attacks and appeals to emotions in candidates’ Facebook posts. Other research has focused on how political campaigns use CONTACT Travis N. Ridout tnridout@wsu.edu Thomas S.

While understanding this “organic” use of social media messaging in campaign is important and useful, we argue for several reasons that more research is needed on campaigns’ use of paid advertising online. One important reason is the billion-plus dollars now spent on such messaging each campaign cycle, sug- gesting campaigns value this type of communica- tion. Related, however, is the fact that campaigns would only spend this sort of money if they needed to do so, which implies both that they are likely to use advertising to reach people who are not already following them and consequently that the messa- ging likely differs from the activity they create and distribute organically. 2 One of the few studies to examine paid advertis- ing online is Ballard, Hillygus and Konitzer (2016), which looked at 840 online display ads from the Obama and Romney campaigns in 2012. Each ad was coded for its characteristics. One finding was that sponsors pursue many different goals in their online advertising. Thirty-seven percent of the ads were found to be aimed at persuasion, while 25% asked for money. Another 20% were aimed at recruitment, and 18% encouraged people to get out to vote. Ridout, Fowler, Franz, and Wang (2017) characterized the goals of online display ads placed during the 2016 presidential campaign. This study found that 52% of the ads were designed to gather information about the viewer, 37% were intended to persuade, 15% requested money, and 14% tried to get the viewer involved in the cam- paign. The same study found little policy informa- tion in online advertising; under a quarter contained information about a policy issue com- pared to 70% of television ads from the same campaigns. Political Importance of Facebook Facebook is now a key political actor and serves as one of the most important platforms for the pur- chase of digital advertising in campaigns. One rea- son campaigns find Facebook valuable is its ability to reach a substantial portion of the electorate (Kreiss & McGregor, 2018). It is estimated that 68% of Americans use the platform (Wagner & Molla, 2018). In the second quarter of 2019, 2.4 billion people used Facebook every month worldwide, 3 and Facebook users in the U.S. spent an average of 40 minutes per day on the site.4 As might be expected, then, spending on political ads on Facebook is growing. Facebook reported just over 700 USD million in political ad spending on its platform between May 2018 and July 2019, including both electioneering and issue advo- cacy ads. Facebook does not just sell advertising to cam- paigns but sometimes takes on a more integral role. Kreiss and McGregor (2018), for instance, talk about how the company developed separate teams to work with Democratic and Republican cam- paigns. The idea was to develop a sense of trust among those campaigns with which they worked. In addition, Facebook worked closely with several of the campaigns in 2016, including Sanders and Trump, providing advice on how to use its plat- form. The company took on more of a consultant role than a vendor role for these campaigns, though it no longer embeds employees within campaigns. Facebook has also played a central role in the spread of misinformation from Russian and other actors in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Kim et al. (2018) examined targeting on Facebook of ads sponsored by groups that do not report to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), including some ads paid for by Russian actors. The study found evidence of geographic targeting (especially to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Virginia), target- ing by race of the user (whites were more likely to receive ads on immigration than people of other races) and targeting by income (with low-income users much more likely to be contacted). A study of targeting on Facebook in the United Kingdom, however, revealed little evidence of ad sponsors focusing their messages to specific groups, as the issues and themes discussed in Facebook ads were similar to those being disseminated by the cam- paigns at the national level (Anstead, Magalhães, Stupart, & Tambini, 2018). Clearly, Facebook’s importance in campaign communication has motivated substantial study of the topic, but existing research has been dominated by the study of organic posts. This is justifiable, of course, as organic posts were originally accessible to 2 T. N. RIDOUT ET AL. scholars whereas systematic data on digital adver- tising was not. It is also the case, however, that digital ads are exponentially more relevant now than in even 2012 or 2014. With new data sources, scholars can now examine paid media strategies, including one important but understudied feature of campaigns: the temporal nature of election messaging. Timing in Campaigns Research has established the importance of sequen- cing and timing in campaigns. We know, for instance, that the tone of messages varies over the course of a campaign. Negativity is rare early in a campaign as candidates try to establish who are they are to the electorate (Damore, 2002). But negativity increases as Election Day approaches (e.g., Goldstein & Freedman, 2002; Peterson & Djupe, 2005), as the potential risk of “going nega- tive” is more likely to be borne when the stakes are highest. Two recent studies have addressed how timing influences the use of online advertising in particu- lar. The first, by Kreiss et al. (2018) stresses the idea that there is a “temporal logic” to online campaigns. The authors’ interviews with campaign staffers point to the importance of first “introducing their candidates, defining their policy positions, and securing party support.” Fundraising is also espe- cially important early in the campaign as it is a metric by which the media and public judge the viability of candidates, while “get out the vote” messages are more important as Election Day approaches. Their interviews also revealed that Twitter is useful in responding to specific (and unexpected) campaign events. The most explicit examination of how timing influences campaign strategies is offered by Zhang et al. (2017), who develop the notion of “strategic temporality” in the context of social media use (specifically, Twitter and Facebook). Although they do not develop a theoretical rationale for why strategies might vary over time, they do provide evidence speaking to how strategies change over the course of a campaign. For instance, they find that “calls to action” increase as Election Day approaches, as do informative messages. The volume of persuasion messages, however, appears not to change over time, nor does the propensity to attack or engage in advocacy messaging. The obser- vations in this research, however, are limited organic posts, not paid advertising. Campaign Goals As recent research has noted, the potential uses of social media in campaigns are different than the potential uses of television, in part due to the affor- dances of various social media platforms (Kreiss et al., 2018; Ridout 2020). The term “affordances” refers to “what various platforms are actually cap- able of doing and perceptions of what they enable, along with the actual practices that emerge as peo- ple interact with platforms” (Kreiss et al., 2018, p. 17). First, Facebook allows for several ways to target potential voters – and in very specific ways (Bossetta, 2018). The platform allows for geo- graphic targeting to very small areas, such as zip codes, and it allows for location-based targeting – reaching individuals where they spend their time, not just where they were when they signed up for their Facebook account. Another way to target voters on Facebook is through their likes or affi- nities. Thus, campaigns can reach people who have particular interests – and tailor ads that match those interests. Campaigns have previously adopted these tactics offline through micro- targeting efforts (Franz, 2019), sometimes with peer-to-peer contacts, targeted television ads on cable or on specific programs with known viewer profiles (Ridout, Franz, Goldstein, & Feltus, 2012). But the capacity to target more precisely is unmatched by the opportunities afforded through social media platforms. Second, Facebook allows campaigns to gather information from users and is especially important for the dissemination of “online acquisition ads,” which aim to acquire contact information from potential donors and supporters. In addition, Facebook allows for links, which means that an ad on Facebook can direct the user to another online location, perhaps a website where one can donate or a website that will provide additional informa- tion about the campaign and further engage users with the content. JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS 3 Given these affordances of Facebook and its flex- ibility relative to television, we expect campaigns to pursue several different goals through their online advertising. Prior literature suggests different cate- gorizations of online activity. Ballard, Hillygus and Konitzer (2016), for example, outlines four mutually exclusive goals: get-out-the-vote (GOTV), persuasion, donation, and campaign recruitment. Zhang et al. (2017) identifies similar but slightly different categories including: “calls to action,” information, persuasion, advocacy and attack as different goals. As we describe below, we identified goals inductively to be more confident that we did not miss an important type but then collapsed into similar categories that have pre- viously been identified in the literature. Expectations We can begin to develop our expectations about how campaigns might use digital advertising by looking first at how they use television advertising. The primary goal of television advertising is per- suasion (Fowler, Franz and Ridout 2016). Because television is unidirectional – the messages are always sent from the campaign to the viewer – campaigns do not expect to receive information in return. Although campaigns could, in theory, implore viewers to visit a website or call a toll-free number in their television ads, this rarely happens in practice. Thus, political ads aimed at fundraising or acquisition are not usually found on television. 5 Television ads with pure mobilization messages are rare as well, likely because of the general audience found watching these ads; campaigns want to mobilize their own partisans, not their opponents. But while television is well suited to persuasion, we expect to find a variety of goals beyond persua- sion pursued on Facebook. One reason for this expectation is the variety of ad types that the plat- forms make available.6 Many Facebook ads are static, featuring text and a photo. Campaign profes- sionals tend to view these types of ad as less suited to persuasion than video because they have a more difficult time attracting viewers’ attention and creating an emotional arousal (Ridout 2020). Although Facebook does offer video ads as well, they have some disadvantages when it comes to persuasion. For one, video on Facebook is not forced view, and many people may be watching with the sound off. Many users access Facebook on their smart phones, meaning they are watching on small screens, and loading speeds may be slow (Dunaway, et al. 2018). In addition, the architecture of Facebook (Bossetta, 2018) allows for links to other websites, the targeting of messages to specific voters, and the tracking of audience behavior through detailed metrics – all features that allow the platform to be used in ways beyond persuasion, including acquisition, fundraising and mobiliza- tion. In sum, we expect to find a variety of goals pursued in Facebook advertising. When do campaigns pursue these various goals through their ads? Our next set of expectations focus on these temporal dynamics. We anticipate that these arguments should apply equally to the general election and to highly contested primary races, though given the lack of contested primary races in our dataset, we can only test these ideas in the general election. Although acquisition is a continual activity, cam- paigns should emphasize this earlier rather than later. The identification of supporters and potential supporters early on gives the campaign more time to get them involved in the campaign – and more time to hit them up for money. An e-mail address of a potential supporter is just more valuable a year before voting starts than in the month before voting starts. Therefore, we expect acquisition ads to be more common early in a campaign. Campaigns always need money, so requests for fundraising should never be absent. Still, fundrais- ing appeals should be organized around two types of events. The first is in anticipation of FEC report- ing deadlines, when campaigns must reveal to the FEC how much they raised. Amounts raised are used by the news media to assess the viability and success of campaigns (Belt, Just, & Crigler, 2012), and thus campaigns work hard to be able to report good fundraising numbers – even sometimes point- ing to those fundraising deadlines in their online appeals. Thus, one might expect to see more fun- draising appeals just prior to these dates than at other times. Second, we expect fundraising appeals to be more common in the final three or four months of a campaign when the national media begin to heap more attention on Senate campaigns. During this time period, more people are tuning in 4 T. N. RIDOUT ET AL. to the race, making them more receptive to cam- paign appeals for donations. This is also the period when campaigns need more money to run their television ads. In sum, we expect fundraising ads to be more common prior to FEC deadlines and during the final months of the campaign. In addition, we expect that mobilization activ- ities, including providing information about how to vote, should occur rather close to Election Day. This might, however, vary a bit by state, as cam- paigns are likely to make a push to register voters right before the window to register closes. They may make another push when absentee or early ballots are available and a final push with such messages right before Election Day. Therefore, we hypothesize that mobilization ads will be more common closer to Election Day. Persuasive appeals should occur later in the cam- paign, closer to the time of voting. The reason for this is that messages may lose their impact over time (Gerber, Gimpel, Green, & Shaw, 2011; Hill, James, Vavreck, & Zaller, 2013). Thus, we expect that persuasion ads will be more common closer to Election Day. Of course, persuasion has two parts in a two- candidate race: making an argument for oneself and discrediting one’s opponent. Among ads with the goal of persuasion, we expect those that men- tion an opponent (whether in a primary or general election), typically referred to as negative ads (Jamieson, Waldman, and Sherr (2000), should occur later in the campaign. Research suggests that candidates may incur a risk of a voter backlash (Garramone, 1984) or media criticism from going negative (i.e., critiquing the opposition), and thus they will reserve mentions of an opponent for when the stakes are higher later in the campaign. Moreover, if the opponent is not well known, a campaign risks giving the opponent free media by going negative early on. To summarize, we expect that negative ads will be more common closer to Election Day. Data and Analysis We obtained data on ads aired on Facebook from Pathmatics (pathmatics.com), a market intelligence firm founded in 2012 that tracks ad impressions and spending using a large opt-in panel of Internet users on iPhones, iPads, Android phones and tablets. The company does not disclose the total number of panel members but states that it is “hun- dreds of thousands” and notes that it is “demogra- phically representative of the U.S. social network population.” 7 There is no guarantee that Pathmatics captured all creatives placed by the campaigns – those creatives seen by a small number of individuals are especially likely to be missed – but given the large size and demographic represen- tativeness of the panel, we are confident that Pathmatics captured the bulk of the ads placed. We compare in Appendix A the Pathmatics data with the universe of data made public directly by Facebook for the period after May 2018, which further bolsters the confidence we have in the data used in the analysis below. One key advantage of using Pathmatics data for this analysis is that we have information for a much longer period than is available through the Facebook ad library, which only begins in May 2018. Pathmatics data also have the advantage of providing daily estimates of spending by each campaign. We also were granted access to the creatives captured by Pathmatics, which allow us to speak to the content of the ads placed. Four coders examined paid ads on Facebook from 12 U.S. Senate campaigns in states that were predicted in April 2018 to be at least somewhat competitive (Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wisconsin). 8 We examined ads placed by both the Democratic and the Republican nominees in each state, but we excluded ads of candidates who were eliminated in party primary races. Thus, we have creatives from 24 different candidates, who are listed in Table 1. Because we were interested in how the content of ads changed over time, we begin our coding on January 1, 2017, almost two years before the general election. We have data on 3,943 coded ads.9 These ads represent an estimated 6.5 USD million in spending and 926,538,300 impressions (views). Table 1 also shows the distri- bution of ads across candidates. We have the most ads from Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill, with 538, and we have the fewest ads from Ohio Senate candidate Jim Renacci, just 15. Our analysis, how- ever, is not based on the number of creatives but on JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS 5 spending on each creative. Doing so gives more weight to those ads that were purchased more often. 10 Four coders viewed a screen capture of each ad and were asked to identify each of the goals pursued by each Facebook ad, choosing from 14 different options. 11 These options were developed from an inductive process through which coders examined hundreds of ads, seeking to identify as many goals as possible.12 The final options were: encourage people to learn something, provide more informa- tion about a policy, ask people to donate money, ask people to sign a petition/birthday card, ask people to act on a policy issue, ask people to answer a survey question, ask people to attend an event, ask people to volunteer for/engage in the campaign, encourage people to turn out to vote (generally), provide information about a favored candidate, provide information about an opposition candi- date, encourage people to vote for/support a candidate, encourage people to vote against/ oppose a candidate, and provide information on how/where to vote (Appendix B provides supple- mental guidance on the coding of each goal). Coders were also asked to identify the primary goal of each ad, based on the percentage of the ad that pursued each goal. In cases in which the con- tent was equally divided between more than one goal, coders used the message conveyed by the photo as the tiebreaker; if there was no photo, the message conveyed by the “button” served as the tiebreaker. We combined ads into four larger cate- gories – similar to the classifications used by Zhang et al. (2017) and Ballard, Hillygus and Konitzer (2016) – based on their primary purpose: acquisi- tion (sign a petition/card or answer survey ques- tion); fundraising (the ask for a donation category); mobilization (encourage voting or ask people to attend a campaign event); and persuasion (provide information about the favored candidate, provide information about an opponent, encourage voting for the favored candidate or encourage voting for the opponent). We show in Appendix C two exam- ples of the four main aggregated categories.13 Coders also identified the tone of each ad, whether it was a promotional ad (only mentioning the spon- sor), an attack ad (only mentioning an opponent, either primary or general election) or a contrast ad (mentioning both the sponsor and the opponent, either primary or general election) (Cohen’s kappa = .85). These categories, identified by Jamieson et al. (2000), are commonly used in the study of political advertising. In the section that follows, we show visually how spending on each goal changes over time, both as a percentage of total advertising and in total volume, and we confirm our visual inspection with statistical models. We estimated fixed-effects regression models predicting the amount of spend- ing by candidate by day on each of the four primary ad goals that we identified. The unit of analysis is the candidate/day. The key model predictor captur- ing campaign timing was the month of the cam- paign, but we also controlled for other temporal aspects as well. First, we controlled for the day of the week as research on television advertising sug- gests that advertising falls off on weekends (Fowler, Franz, & Ridout, 2016). We also included an indi- cator of the week prior to the primary in each state (coded 1 on those 7 days and 0 otherwise), as we expected advertising to climb prior to primary elec- tion days.14 We also controlled for the week prior to each FEC campaign finance-reporting deadline (coded 1 on those 7 days and 0 otherwise), as campaigns often coordinate fundraising efforts around these deadlines.

N. RIDOUT ET AL. were March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, and in 2018 were March 31, June 30, September 30, and October 17. Finally, the models included a lagged dependent variable, that is, the candidate’s spending on the particular type of advertising on the previous day, to account for the fact that ad expenditures are often sticky. Of course, there are a lot of candidate-specific factors that might influence a congressional candi- date’s campaign spending, including incumbency and the competitiveness of the race (Jacobson, 1997). Because our sample of campaigns was rela- tively small and because we wanted to focus on the impact of timing, we included candidate-specific fixed effects in the model. By including fixed effects, we are effectively controlling for all those candi- date-specific factors that influence levels of ad spending, allowing the effects of timing to be revealed. Results Figure 1 shows Facebook spending on ads aired (in thousands) by all candidates in our dataset com- bined. One thing that is immediately clear is that advertising by candidates began very early, with several candidates running ads in January of 2017. These included Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Rick Scott of Florida (who had not announced his can- didacy at that point), Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. With the exception of Scott, all were incumbents planning to run for reelection. The figure also shows that spending on Facebook ads was rather steady throughout 2017. It then climbed a bit in early 2018 and plateaued at that level until summer, when it continued to ramp up. In early October, spending on advertising spiked to over 500,000 USD a week in the races examined. (See also Appendix A for a comparison of advertis- ing trends by week in both the Pathmatics data, starting in May 2018, and the public Facebook data). As a point of comparison, we plot candidate spending on television advertising (in millions) in these same races over time in Figure 2. 15 The first television ads did not air until early November 2017, and television ad spending remained low until March of 2018, when several incumbents – and one candidate seeking a contested party nomination – began airings ads. After reaching a peak in early May, television ad spending declined a bit as primary contests in Indiana and West Virginia wrapped up. Ad spend- ing then began a steady and steep rise after Independence Day, hitting over 15 USD million a week by the last few weeks of the campaign. Although there are some similarities in the timing of Facebook and television ad spending, the pat- terns remain distinct, a finding that points to the Figure 1. Facebook Spending by Week.

Table 2 shows the distribution of goals pursued in each Facebook advertisement, confirming our expectation that Facebook advertising would pur- sue a variety of goals. Keep in mind also that coders could note more than one goal in each ad – and many ads appeared to be pursuing at least three, if not four, of these objectives at the same time. The most common objective was encouraging the viewer to learn something (47.6%), followed closely by encouraging the viewer to vote for a candidate (44.0%). Almost 40% of ads provided information about a favored candidate, while a quarter asked people to answer a “survey” question. These ques- tions were designed not to measure people’s opi- nions but to get them to provide their contact information to the campaign, and thus they fall into the larger category of acquisition. Twenty-two percent of the ads encouraged view- ers to get involved in the campaign in some way, while 20% provided information about an opposi- tion candidate. Sixteen percent of ads asked directly for a donation, and 14% encouraged people to sign a “petition” or a “birthday card” for a politician, another form of acquisition. Encouraging people to vote against a candidate occurred rather infre- quently, in 13% of ads. Surprisingly few ads had mobilization as a goal, perhaps because the candi- dates had outsourced mobilization to the political parties, whose efforts in that regard likely helped all of a party’s nominees on the ballot. When we col- lapse the categories, 34.6% of ads had persuasion as a primary purpose, 30.6% had acquisition as a primary purpose, 21.1% had fundraising as a primary purpose, 2.0% focused on mobilization primarily, and 11.7% had some other primary pur- pose. All told, we find a wide distribution of ad goals in the set of coded ads, and this supports our first expectation. Figure 2. Television Ad Spending by Week in Senate. Source: Pathmatics Table 2.

N. RIDOUT ET AL. We now start to investigate the temporal logic of the campaign in two ways. First, we visually inspect the trends with a series of figures that show both the percentage of spending and the total spending devoted to ads with the primary purpose of pursu- ing each goal. Second, we confirm the patterns with statistical models that predict spending while con- trolling for candidate-level fixed effects, lagged spending, and other factors. These models provide assurances that the aggregate patterns seen in the visuals hold up across the individual campaigns. We had suggested that acquisition would be focused earlier in the campaign, as the longer a campaign has someone’s contact information, the more useful it is. Figure 3 shows the percentage of ad spending (in the left panel) and total spending (in that right panel) in each week that was devoted to acquisition. Weeks covered Wednesday to Tuesday so that the final week of the campaign would be the same length as all others. In most months of 2017, over 80% of the ads engaged in some form of acquisition. Not until June of 2018 did the percentage of ads engaging in acquisition fall below 50%. By September and October of 2018, acquisition was pursued by a fairly small percentage of ads. By that point, presumably, campaigns had generated lengthy lists of e-mails and phone num- bers to text. Total spending on acquisition ads in each week tracks closely with the percentage of spending devoted to these ads. A statistical model (Table 3) confirms this pat- tern. Based on the positive and significant coeffi- cients, acquisition ads were more common in several months, including July and August of 2017, November of 2017, January, February, March and May of 2018. Acquisition ads were also driven by the previous day’s spending but did not respond to the presence of the primary election, a campaign finance deadline or the day of the week. Clearly, both the figures and the model support the expectation that acquisition was taking place quite early in the campaign – and was deemphasized as Election Day approached. Requesting donations followed a quite different pattern, as Figure 4 shows. Requests for money were rare in 2017, when many campaigns had not officially launched. The one exception was one week in March of 2017, when fundraising ads spiked to over 30% of total spending, but as the right panel makes clear, the actual amount on spending on fundraising ads in that week was still quite small. Fundraising ads become more Figure 3. Facebook Ad Spending on Acquisition Over Time. Source: Pathmatics JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS 9 common by April of 2018. By July, over a quarter of spending was on ads whose primary purpose was fundraising. We suspect that requests for donations picked up because campaign expenses accelerated during the middle of the year. Candidates needed cash to pay for the television ads they were soon to launch. Moreover, the potential return on invest- ment of purchasing ads that requested donations was likely higher closer to Election Day, as many small-dollar donors had become excited by the campaigns at that point, thanks in part to increased media coverage, and were much more likely to give than 6 or 12 months prior. Even in the final weeks of the campaign, the campaigns were investing heavily in fundraising appeals. The statistical model in Table 3 shows a significant increase in October of 2018 – when campaigns were seeking extra funds to pay for last-minute ads – and when potential donors were excited enough by the cam- paign to give. We also see some spikes in ad spending that correspond with FEC reporting deadlines, as we expected, which are shown by the vertical lines. The most prominent is in March of 2017 during the 13th week of the year. Similar spikes occurred in June of 2017, March of 2018 and June of 2018, immediately preceding FEC reporting deadlines. These spikes are confirmed by the regression model in Table 3, which shows significantly increased spending on fundraising ads before these reporting deadlines. Campaigns, it appears, were trying to use those deadlines to convince donors to give. There was also a spike in fundrais- ing requests in July of 2018 as well – after the reporting deadline had passed. Many of the fun- draising ads seen in July were placed by Democratic candidates and mentioned Trump – and his nomi- nation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court – negatively. Figure 5 speaks to mobilization appeals. Mobilization appeals are the least common of the four main types we discuss, constituting under 4% of all ad spending in every week of the campaign. The percentage of total spending on mobilization ads rises during the first quarter of 2018, corresponding with primary election dates, and also rises above 0 in the weeks closest to Election Day. Total spending on mobilization ads, as shown in the right panel, does climb considerably toward the end of the campaign – but still constitutes a very small amount of spending. The statistical model in Table 4 confirms that spend- ing on mobilization ads was marginally higher in July and August of 2018 and especially in October and November of 2018. As predicted, spending on mobi- lization peaked close to Election Day. Also notable was that spending on mobilization ads was strongly influenced by spending in the previous day but did not vary by the day of the week. Figure 6 traces persuasive appeals over time. These persuasion ads combine four primary goals: providing information about the favored candidate, providing information about an opponent, encouraging voting for the favored candidate and discouraging voting for the opponent. Clearly, persuasion ads increase as a proportion of total ads as Election Day approached, making up more than half of ads in several of the final weeks of the campaign – and constituting over 4 in 5 ads in the final week of the campaign. That said, persuasion was not entirely absent early on – even Table 3. Predictors of Acquisition and Fundraising Ad Spending.

Even at this early stage, candidates were providing information about themselves and their primary and general election opponents, though to a much smaller degree. Figure 4.

Source: Pathmatics JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS 11 Turning to the estimates from the model in Table 4, we see that although the previous day’s spending was again a significant predictor, the presence of an upcoming primary was, somewhat surprisingly, not. Campaigns did not increase their spending on persua- sion appeals in the week prior to the primary election in their state. That said, there was an increase in spending on persuasion ads in February of 2018 (prior to the primaries in several states) and closer to Election Day, with August, September, October, and November seeing increased spending on persua- sion. Note how the coefficients in each month increase as well. How did the tone of the advertising change over time on Facebook? By and large, the percentage of spending on ads that mentioned an opponent (what we can think of as attack or contrast ads) increased over the course of the campaign, peaking in the run-up to Election Day, as the left panel in Figure 7 shows. This finding is consistent with our expec- tations. That said, there were earlier spikes in nega- tivity, one in August of 2017 and one in January of 2018. These earlier mentions usually took the form of a candidate speaking of an action or vote of an expected opponent in an acquisition ad. In one ad, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida spoke about how his presumed opponent, Governor Rick Scott, had failed to take action on climate change, using that as impetus for a “survey” designed to get people’s contact information. The right panel in Figure 7 shows, unsurprisingly, that the volume of spending on ads that mention an opponent increased dramatically toward the end of the campaign, as spending – and spending on attack ads even more so – ramped up. Estimates from a model predicting spending on negative and contrast ads are shown in Table 5. As expected, spending on these ads was significantly higher only in September, October and November of 2018. The previous day’s spending on negative and contrast ads was also a positive predictor of the current day’s spending, and spending on negative and contrast ads was less on Mondays than on Sundays (the baseline). Discussion Our analysis of paid advertising on Facebook from 12 different U.S. Senate campaigns in 2018 reveals that there is a temporal logic – a “strategic temporality” – to the decisions cam- paigns make about advertising. First, Facebook advertising among U.S. Senate candidates starts early – almost two years before Election Day in some instances. And although it ramps up close to Election Day, as is the case with television advertising, the volume of ad impressions on Facebook stays at a fairly stable level for a very long time. Second, we found that acquisition is emphasized earlier in a campaign, but once the campaign has a substantial contact list, it turns its attention to raising money. Third, candidates are generally silent about their opponents (whether primary or general election) early in the campaign, but that changes a few months away from Election Day. By October of 2018, opponents were mentioned in about half of the ad impressions. Finally, we found that informa- tion on how to vote – and encouragements to vote – are reserved for when they are needed: close to Election Day. Table 4.

Overall, our findings support the idea that the specific affordances of Facebook, especially its interactivity, its ability to link to other websites and campaigns’ ability to target messages, influ- ences the types of messages viewers see. These messages are much more varied that what one Figure 6. Facebook Ad Spending on Persuasion Over Time. Source: Pathmatics Figure 7. Facebook Ad Spending on Opponent Mentions Over Time. Source: Pathmatics JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS 13 sees on television, where most ads are designed with the goal of persuasion first and foremost. But the patterns of use we saw on Facebook may not extend to other social media platforms. Google, for instance, allows campaigns to do different things than Facebook. It is often used by campaigns to drive traffic to their websites by buying search results. That is, when someone searches for the name of a candidate, the name of an opponent or even a specific issue, an ad will appear with the search results, directing the searcher to the cam- paign’s website. To give another example, YouTube excels at video, which may have more persuasive impact on voters than the visual and text combina- tions typically seen on Facebook (though some campaigns do place video on Facebook). One can also force viewers to watch ads – or parts of ads – on YouTube. It is worth noting some limitations of our study. First, we examined only races for U.S. Senate, which are typically well funded. Thus, we might expect the use of Facebook to be more sophisticated by these campaigns than by underfunded candi- dates or those running in local races. Second, we chose the 12 races we examined because they were expected to be particularly competitive when we chose them in May of 2018, and so our findings may not extend to uncompetitive races. To provide a partial test of this idea, we examined separately three of those races that turned out not to be not all that competitive – those in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 16 Indeed, if we examine candidates in those three races separately, we find fewer effects of timing on spending.17 Third, we examined adver- tising in 2017 and 2018, a time during which Facebook allowed campaigns to do certain things and target in certain ways. These affordances were somewhat different in 2016 and evolved for the 2020 campaign, especially now that campaigns have more transparent information about what competitors are doing through the platform ad libraries. Thus, a description of how any platform is used in campaigning is time bound. This analysis presents a detailed look at how the goals of Facebook advertising activity (as measured by its content) change over time. The findings, in general, provide strong support for the idea that any explanation of how campaigns deploy online advertising must take account of the goals being pursued – and the stage of the campaign. Digital ad spending is growing so fast that it may soon rival television spending in many campaigns, and it is already critical to campaigns where television spending is not practical (Fowler, Franz, Martin, Peskowitz, & Ridout, Forthcoming). This study offers a first take on how campaigns deploy these ads, what goals they pursue, and how their purpose changes over time. One lesson of this study for those who study campaign communications is that the world of online advertising is much more complex to study than the world of television advertising, which one could safely assume was done to persuade or change voters’ minds. But understanding online advertising requires digging into the interaction of the ad’s goal and the timing of the campaign. Second, not only does timing matter, but to truly understand campaign strategies, one might need to look back a dozen months or more prior to Election Day. The traditional approach of beginning a study of American elections on Labor Day – a couple of Table 5. Predictors of Negative (and Contrast) Ads.

RIDOUT ET AL. months before voters cast their ballots – will miss a lot of the action, as many campaigns start raising funds and engaging in acquisition messages up to two years before voters go to the polls. The lesson for political campaigns is, in some ways, similar: digital advertising is not the same as television advertising – those long-held rules of thumb that have guided the purchase and content of television advertising will likely not work in a digital world. Future studies of campaigns must account more for the way new mediums of com- munication allow campaigns to be more dynamic, both in what they say to voters and what they ask of them. Notes 1. This is in many ways a second-generation set of research. Initial work in the late 1990s and early 2000s focused on campaign websites and the “webstyle” of those sites (Bystrom et al 2004). 2. According to Facebook’s political ad archive, over $1.4 billion was spent by advertisers on local, state, and federal election and policy-related ads on its plat- form between May 2018 and June 2020. These totals are from a report for “All Dates” at www.facebook. com/ads/library/report. Not all of these ads were explicitly election-related, but Facebook is just one platform for digital ad spending. Google reports Google search ads and YouTube ads, as well as ads purchased directly on specific websites. One might also consider ads purchased on streaming television or radio channels or applications like Pandora or Hulu. A recent report from the Wesleyan Media Project found that through June 27, 2020 (and for the period back to January 2019), ad sponsors in the presidential race alone had spent nearly $370 million on just Facebook and Google ads ($218 million on Facebook and $151 million on Google). See report at: https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/releases-070220/ (Accessed on 7/9/20). 3. https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of- monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/(accessed July 31, 2019) 4. https://marketingland.com/time-spent-on-facebook- snapchat-remains-flat-but-instagram-sees-growth -261,705 (accessed July 31, 2019) 5. To help establish this point, we conducted a separate analysis of 1,922 television ads aired during 2020 in federal and gubernatorial races. Coders indicated whether each ad was aimed at persuasion, providing information, encouraging a contact, fundraising or sell- ing merchandise and indicated the primary goal of each ad. We found that 88% of television ads had persuasion as the primary goal and 96% had persuasion as a goal. 6. This is enhanced with the comparatively low cost to produce ads on Facebook, especially compared with the cost to produce slick television ads. This allows campaigns to experiment with different ad formats and use the engagement metrics tracked by Facebook to derive what kinds of messages or ad content has more impact on voters. Notably this also allows campaigns to experiment with ad types within a goal. For example, campaigns can test which types of fund-raising mes- sages produce higher click rates. 7. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/path matics-launches-first-panel-based-paid-social-ad- intelligence-300567692.html 8. These were the races not rated as “solid” by the Inside Elections April 20, 2018, Senate Ratings. Texas was also initially in this sample, but because the volume of ads in that state was so much greater than anywhere else, we eliminated it from our final sample so as to make coding manageable. 9. This number might, at first glance, seem low given the hundreds of thousands of digital creatives that presi- dential campaigns place. But we do not believe this number indicates a problem with the data. First, most Senate campaigns do not have millions of dollars to invest in a digital team, like a presidential campaign does, and thus they are unlikely to create thousands of distinct ads. Second, ads with minor variations (a change in the color of a font, e.g.) might not appear as separate creatives in the Pathmatics data. We discuss this also in Appendix A. 10. Pathmatics was unable to capture the creatives for a small number of ads, even though the company was able to estimate spending and impressions for those ads. Thus, we were unable to code these ads. These uncap- tured ads account for 5.96% of total impressions and 5.95% of spending. 11. For video ads, coders did not have the ability to click through and watch the entire ad. Instead, they saw the initial image of the video, along with the text surround- ing the video. Given that most Facebook users choose not to play videos, this coding procedure mimics the experience of most Facebook users. 12. One of the authors developed an initial list of potential goals (from the perspective of the campaign) based on an examination of 100 Facebook ads sampled from various points in the campaign. This initial list of goals was then given to a coder who did sample coding using that list. The two then met to discuss the cate- gories, which were refined based on the input of the coder, resulting in 14 goals. 13. To assess the reliability of the coding, we asked one of the coders to recode a random sample of 418 ads that were coded by the other three coders. The reliability of the coding varied considerably. More specifically, the Cohen’s kappa for the aggregated categories based on JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS 15 the primary purpose of the ad was 0.75 for persuasion, 0.88 for acquisition, 0.58 for mobilization and 1 for fundraising (the Krippendorf’s alpha was the same as the Kappa to the second decimal point for each cate- gory). Although the reliability of the mobilization cate- gory is below traditional thresholds, we note that this type of ad is uncommon, a situation that can lead to reliability statistics that fluctuate wildly based on the coding of one or two observations. Because it is an important theoretical category, we include the findings for the mobilization category in spite of the low relia- bility and urge readers to be cautious in making too much of the findings for that type. 14. An alternative model specification included an indicator of the week before a competitive primary (defined as a primary race in which a candidate won by fewer than 10% of the vote) instead of an indicator of the week before a primary. The substantive findings do not change at all, and the model estimates barely move when we use the alternative model. 15. Television spending data come from the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks spending on broadcast television stations in all media markets in the United States. These data are commonly used by scholars in the study of television ads in U.S. electoral campaigns (see Fowler et al., 2016). 16. All three were rated as “solid Democratic” by Inside Elections in their final pre-election ratings. 17. More specifically, in terms of predicting spending on acquisition, only the November 2017 dummy variable remains a significant predictor. In regard to fundraising, only the first campaign finance deadline remains a significant predictor of spending, and the spike in fundraising appeals in October of 2018 is no longer evident. In terms of mobilization, while the significance of the July 2018 indicator variable remains, the later month indicators are no longer significant. Finally, in speaking of persuasion, the significance of the February 2018 and October 2018 indicators remains, but three other month indicators are no longer signifi- cant predictors of spending.
