Email: kmtran@uwaterloo.ca Summary With the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), the demands for rechargeable and high-performance batteries like lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have soared. Li-ion battery systems require the use of a battery management system (BMS) to perform safely and efficiently. Accurate and reliable battery modeling is important for the BMS to function properly. Currently, many BMS applications use the equivalent circuit model due to its simplicity. However, with the development of a cloud BMS, machine learning battery models can be utilized, which can potentially improve the accuracy and reliability of the BMS. This work investigates the performance of four different machine learn- ing models used to predict the thermal (temperature) and electrical (voltage) behaviors of Li-ion battery cells. A prismatic Li-ion battery cell with a capacity of 25 Ah was cycled under a constant current profile at three different ambient temperatures, and the surface temperature and voltage of the battery were measured. The four machine learning regression models—linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and decision tree—were developed using the scikit-learn library in Python and validated with experimental data. The results of their performance were reported and compared using the R2 metric. The decision tree-based model, with an R2 score of 0.99, was determined to be the best model in this case study.

Lithium-ion (Li-ion) bat- teries have garnered the most interest out of all battery types.2,3 This is because they have numerous advantages such as high energy density, high power density, long cycle life, low self-discharge rate, small size, lightweight, rapid charging capabilities, and wide temperature range.4-7 The battery packs in EVs usually consist of hun- dreds to thousands of Li-ion cells. To extend the life of the battery, some precautions must be considered during the operation of the battery application since, for instance, exceeding voltage, current, capacity, or power limits may result in damages to the battery cells. 8-10 Sometimes, the possibility of a dangerous thermal run- away can also occur without appropriate actions being taken promptly, as there have been cases of EVs catching fire.11-13 Therefore, Li-ion batteries must be electrically and thermally monitored and controlled to prevent these issues to ensure the performance of the vehicles and the safety of the users.14,15 The battery management system (BMS), hence, is an important part of the battery system in EVs because it helps to control and monitor the safety and performance of the battery pack. 16,17 The BMS acts as the brain of the battery system. Using sensors, it measures and records the voltage, cur- rent, and temperature of the battery in order to perform its functions.18 The main functions of the BMS include battery monitoring, fault detection, cell balancing, deter- mination of battery states such as state of health (SOH) and state of charge (SOC), energy management during operation, and thermal management.19-21 For example, a BMS in an EV application can capture the current, volt- age, power, and temperature of the battery to then make comparisons with predicted values from the battery model, allowing the BMS to detect any battery faults. Many of the BMS functions require an accurate and reli- able battery model. Among various battery models, the equivalent circuit model (ECM) is the most used in real- time BMS applications due to its sufficient accuracy and low computational effort as well as its stability when used on major commercial Li-ion battery chemistries.22,23 There are methods of estimating the ECM parameters online as the battery degrades. However, if measurement errors accumulate or BMS sensor faults occur, the ECM parameters often become more complicated and harder to estimate to predict the behavior of the battery system and help the BMS function accurately and reliably. With the rise of cloud computing and storage, as well as better BMS architecture, more complex yet more accurate bat- tery algorithms than the ECM, including machine-learn- ing-based battery algorithms, can be implemented in the BMS for EVs in the near future, as a complementary approach to assist with the existing battery control methods. Machine learning (ML) is an approach within the field of artificial intelligence that teaches computers to learn and improve from data and process history using a set of algorithms so that reprogramming is not neces- sary. 24 In the field of energy storage, ML has emerged as a promising modeling approach recently. Feng et al. 25 used a simplified single particle model and a lumped thermal model to predict the battery temperature and ter- minal voltage. A neural network was incorporated to enhance the performance of the two models, formulating a complete electrochemical-thermal-neural-network (ETNN) model. Through validation experiments, the ETNN model was found to be able to estimate battery voltage and temperature accurately within an ambient temperature range of \u000110 to 40\u0003C and a discharge rate of 10C. Li et al 26 developed a Li-ion battery model based on a deep learning algorithm and validated the model using data from electric buses. The result showed that the bat- tery modeling method was able to simulate the battery characteristics accurately, and the mean absolute per- centage error of the terminal voltage estimation is within 2.5%. Accurate SOC estimation plays a very important role in ensuring reliable functional operation of the BMS within a Li-ion battery system. Widodo et al27 proposed a battery SOH estimation approach using the sample entropy (SampEn) feature of discharge voltage. SampEn can be used as a battery SOH indicator by utilizing algo- rithms to compute the predictability of a time series as well as to quantify the regularity of a data set. Two ML algorithms were developed, which were the support vec- tor machine (SVM) and the relevance vector machine (RVM), where SampEn was the input and the SOH was the target vector to be estimated. It was found that both proposed algorithms performed well in terms of SOH pre- diction, with RVM being the superior algorithm. Hu et al28 utilized the fuzzy C-means clustering technique on a Li-ion battery dataset of an EV drive cycle to determine the topology and antecedent parameters of the model. The results were then used to estimate the battery SOC. The proposed SOC estimation method was experimen- tally validated and found to be more accurate than other conventional fuzzy modeling approaches. Chemali et al. 29 proposed an SOC estimation method using deep neural networks, another type of ML algorithm. The experiments were conducted using various drive cycle profiles and ambient temperatures to obtain data to train the neural networks. In this approach, the battery volt- age, current, and temperature were directly mapped to the SOC via the neural networks. This ML-based SOC estimator was then validated using different datasets, returning relatively low errors. The performance of vari- ous ML models has been studied and compared with the equivalent circuit and physics-based models.30 The 2 TRAN ET AL. incorporation of domain knowledge provided the means of explainable “white box” predictions. ML models can result in fast and accurate battery state predictions in real time. In this work, a comparison between four multivariate multioutput regression ML methods used to predict bat- tery voltage and temperature is conducted using the scikit-learn library in Python. This study focuses on ana- lyzing the feasibility of using ML in battery modeling as well as comparing the performance of different ML algo- rithms as battery models. The experimental data are recorded at different ambient temperatures along with other measurements. The ambient temperature, capacity, and current are used as inputs to the ML regressors to predict the voltage and temperature as the outputs. The experiments conducted on a 25-Ah GBS Li-ion battery cell performing under a different constant current dis- charge/charge rate of 1C at different ambient tempera- tures of 5 \u0003C, 22 \u0003C, and 35\u0003C are presented. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no similar studies have been reported in the existing literature. The structure of this article is as follows. In the first part of the research, an experimental study is presented including a detailed description of the experimental setup. Thereafter, the results obtained from the cell using four ML models are presented and discussed in the main section of this article. Potential applications and conclu- sions are then discussed in the last section. 2 | EXPERIMENTAL SETUP The experiments involved a 25-Ah GBS lithium iron phosphate battery cell, used for data collection and model validation, with specifications shown in Table 1. The completed experimental setup for battery testing is shown in Figure 1. This setup consists of three components: a MACCOR battery tester, a CSZ MicroClimate thermal chamber, and a computer. The current collectors and voltage sensors from the MACCOR were connected to the cell in the thermal chamber. The computer has a software application that controls the cycling of the cell, where the current is assumed to be positive during the discharging step and negative during the charging step. A 1C-rate constant current profile was used for charging and discharging the battery. The volt- age and current data were collected at a frequency of 1 Hz and stored in the computer. The thermal chamber was used to simulate different ambient temperatures for the battery testing environments. Three ambient temper- atures were considered in this study, which were run in the order of 22\u0003C, 5\u0003C, and 35\u0003C. The surface tempera- ture of the battery was measured and stored in the com- puter using the thermocouples attached to the battery cell as shown in Figure 2. 3 | MACHINE L EARNING M ODELS Four ML models for battery behavior prediction and analysis were built using the scikit-learn library in Python.31-33 The experimental data such as test time, capacity, current, voltage, energy, and temperature were recorded during the battery cycling at three different ambient temperatures. The temperatures were recorded from eight distinct points on the battery cell. A glimpse of sample data during the cycling at the ambient temper- ature of 22\u0003C is shown in Figure 3. The goal of using ML is to develop a model that can predict the battery voltage and temperature based on the capacity, current, and sur- face temperature of the battery. The first step in the ML model development was to identify the type of ML TABLE 1 GBS 25-Ah lithium-ion battery cell specifications Specifications Value Cathode material LiFeMnPO4 Anode material Graphite Electrolyte Carbonate-based Nominal capacity 25 Ah Nominal voltage range 3.2 V Dimensions 125 mm \u0004 280 mm \u0004 234 mm Max charging current 3C Max discharging current 3C (Continuous)/10C (pulsed) Operating temperature \u000120\u0003Cto65\u0003C Weight 3.2 kg FI GU RE 1 Experimental setup TRAN ET AL. 3 domain. This battery model is the type of multivariate supervised regression learning using batch learning for training.34 The steps for ML battery data modeling are shown in Figure 4. The first step for ML model development is to collect relevant experimental data. A total of 18 600 sample points were recorded at three operating temperatures. Jupyter Notebook was used for ML algorithm develop- ment. The data were imported into the notebook using the Pandas dataframe structure. A dataframe is a two- dimensional size-mutable data structure. The rows of the dataframe represent the samples, and the columns repre- sent the data features. The number of features should be reduced to effectively develop the model and minimize data dimensionality. During the data preparation step, the average temperature was calculated from the eight individual temperatures. The ambient temperature, capacity, current, voltage, and average surface tempera- ture of the battery were selected as the final features for the ML model development. Since the input features are not on the same scale, feature scaling was applied during ML model development. The final step of data prepara- tion is to split the data into training, validation, and test- ing sets. Specifically, 70% of total data points were used for training and cross-validation, and the remaining 30% of the data were used for testing. Developing ML algorithms involves a sequence of tasks including data preprocessing, features extraction, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model fitting, and validation. A pipeline consists of a sequence of stages. There are two basic types of pipeline stages: trans- formers and estimators. Data visualization and prepara- tion belong to the transformer pipeline, whereas model selection and hyperparameter tuning belong to theFIGURE 2 GBS 25-Ah battery cell and thermocouple locations FIGURE 4 Development steps for machine learning battery modeling FIGURE 3 Sample battery performance data at ambient temperature 4 TRAN ET AL. estimator pipeline. Scikit-learn provides libraries to build both pipelines. The most crucial step in data preparation is to select which models to try to fit the data. The battery problem is a multi-output regression-type ML problem. Multi- output regression refers to regression problems that involve predicting two or more numerical values given some input samples, for example, predicting the future battery voltage and temperature from inputs such as ambient temperature, capacity, and current, as well as current battery voltage and temperature. Many ML algorithms are designed for predicting a single numeric value. Some regression ML algorithms support multiple outputs directly. The following four ML algorithms have been implemented using scikit-learn:35 1. Linear regressor (LR) 2. k-Nearest neighbors regressor (KNNR) 3. Random forest regressor (RFR) 4. Decision tree regressor (DTR) Linear regression is used to fit a model with coefficients by minimizing the residual sum of squares between the observed data and the predicted data. It is used to deter- mine whether there is a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent vari- ables. In this study, a linear regression algorithm was developed, and a model was fit using the training data. Once trained, the model was tested with both the test data and the full data. The performance of the model is discussed in the “Results and Discussion” section. k-Nearest neighbors (KNN) is a simple algorithm that classifies new data based on a similarity measure (eg, dis- tance functions) with the input data. KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition. The idea behind nearest neighbor methods is to find a pre- determined number of training objects that are the clos- est to the new point and use them to predict its label. The number of samples can be a user-defined constant (KNN learning). It can also vary depending on the density of points locally (radius-based neighbor learning). The dis- tance can often be of any metrics, but the standard Euclidean distance is selected for the ML algorithm in this study. The KNNR is the modified implementation of KNN that calculates the average of the numerical target of the KNN. A KNNR algorithm was developed in this work, and a model was fit using the training data. Once trained, the model was tested with both the test data and the full data. The performance of the model is discussed in the “Results and Discussion” section. Random forest or random decision forest is an ensem- ble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that functions by constructing a multitude of decision trees (DTs) at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. The RFR scikit-learn estimator was developed, trained, and tested with the experimental battery datasets in this study. DTs are versatile ML algorithms that can perform both classification and regression tasks and support mul- tiple outputs. The structure of a DT model resembles an inverted tree where the nodes represent features or pre- dictors, the links or branches between the nodes repre- sent decisions, and the leaves represent responses or outputs. Regression DT can output continuous values that are appropriate for battery modeling. This method can perform data fitting, make predictions quickly, and require relatively low memory usage. DTR was developed using the scikit-learn library and used to train, validate, and test the experimental battery data. These ML models were selected for this study due to their ease of implementation using the scikit-learn library in Python as well as their popularity in real-world data fitting problems. Since other physical models such as ECM are often unable to fit battery data well once the battery is deeply degraded, ML models can be more accu- rate by learning and adapting to data from new battery states. All four models have been trained separately with the same training data and tested on the same testing data. All models output two values for each set of input values. The performance of each algorithm and its predic- tion plots are discussed in the “Results and Discussion” section. 4 | RESULTS A ND DISCUSSION The data plots for the features used in the ML models are shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that the voltage plot is almost identical for each cycle at various operating tem- peratures, while the battery average temperature varia- tion is significant due to the difference in the three ambient temperatures simulated during the experiment. The average temperature plot demonstrated that battery temperature nearly remained constant during its dis- charge cycle at an ambient temperature of 22\u0003C. The bat- tery temperature increased and then decreased to a lower value for the discharge cycle at an ambient temperature of 5\u0003C, whereas at an ambient temperature of 35 \u0003C, it increased and remained high throughout the discharge cycle. All four ML models were trained, validated, and tested with the battery dataset, and their performance is measured using R2 (R-squared). R2 is a statistical mea- sure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. TRAN ET AL. 5 It is also known as the coefficient of determination. A higher coefficient is an indicator of better goodness of fit for the observations. The best possible score for R2 is 1. A constant model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would get an R2 score of 0. The R2 score can be negative because the model can be arbitrarily worse. Once the models were trained and cross-validated, they were also tested on the full set to obtain the plots for both voltage and temperature predictions. The plots for all four methods are shown in Figure 6. Figure 6A,B shows voltage and temperature predictions using LR. The LR approach did not fit the data well, and it predicted a low value for both voltage and temperature. The R 2 score for LR was found to be 0.5. The plots shown in Figure 6C,D are voltage and temperature plots using the KNNR method. It performed better than linear regression. However, the results using KNNR did not fit well at high ambient temperature values. The R2 score for KNNR was determined to be 0.75. RFR voltage and temperature prediction plots are shown in Figure 6E,F. The model fits well with the full range of data. However, it seems noisy for both voltage and temperature predic- tions. The R2 score for RFR was calculated to be 0.94. The performance of the DTR approach is shown in Figure 6G,H. The DT model with a leaf size of 150 was found to have the best fit. It predicted both voltage and temperature for the entire range of data with good results. This method achieved the R2 score of 0.99. All four models were observed to perform better at the ambient temperature of 22\u0003C compared to those at the ambient temperatures of 5\u0003Cor35 \u0003C. Overall, the four ML models showed decent levels of accuracy as can be seen with the trends of the predicted data matching those of the experimental data. Even though the ML models did not perform as well as other models in exis- ting literature, such as the ECM, due to the lack of bat- tery data, the model errors would be improved in future studies with more data. ML battery models, once opti- mized, should have the ability to outperform other FIGURE 5 Data plots of battery machine learning model features 6 TRAN ET AL. physical models especially when the battery is deeply degraded. More data from more battery cells tested can potentially improve the accuracy of the models, as ML models are often significantly dependent on data. With assistance from cloud computing and cloud storage in the future, more battery data can be obtained and analyzed FIGURE 6 Machine learning models predictions for battery voltage and temperature TRAN ET AL. 7 in real time using cloud BMS applications.36 The increas- ing amount of data will allow ML models to be more accurate and reliable than the ECM, especially as the bat- teries start to degrade over time.37 Table 2 shows a summary of the performance of all ML models with their R2 score. As can be seen, the DT- based regressor is the best for the multiple output predic- tion for the battery analysis problem, and it is rec- ommended to be used for ML battery modeling in BMS applications when the BMS architecture allows for more complex algorithms. The use of ML battery models can potentially increase the accuracy and reliability of the BMS in EVs in the future to ultimately improve the safety and performance of EV applications. 5 | CONCLUSION S This research work has reported a comprehensive investi- gation and comparison of four ML models used to predict the electrical (voltage) and thermal (temperature) perfor- mance of a GBS 25-Ah Li-ion battery cell cycling at a cur- rent of 1C-rate and three different ambient temperatures. The ML models were created using the scikit-learn library in Python, and the simulated data were validated with the experimental data for battery voltage and tem- perature. The battery ML models were able to capture the battery's electrical and thermal behaviors over a wide range of ambient temperatures. It is observed that battery temperature nearly remained constant during its dis- charge cycle at the ambient temperature of 22\u0003C, increased and decreased to a low value for discharge cycle at the ambient temperature of 5 \u0003C, and increased and remained high throughout the discharge cycle at the ambient temperature of 35\u0003C. The ML regression models, including linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and decision tree, were trained, validated, and tested with five features as inputs: ambient temperature, battery capacity, battery current, past battery voltage, and past battery temperature. The models predicted two out- puts: future battery voltage and future battery tempera- ture. Among the ML models, the DT-based model resulted in the best performance with an R2 score of 0.99.
