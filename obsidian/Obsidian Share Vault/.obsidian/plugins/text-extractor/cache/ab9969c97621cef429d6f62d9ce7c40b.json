The agents are assumed to take discrete opinion values that depend on both internal and external influences. The inhomogeneity of external influence on individuals is modeled as a random field. Two types of electorates have been considered. In an electorate with only conformist agents short- duration high impact campaigns are highly effective. These are, however, also sensitive to perturbations at the local level modeled as inflexibles and/or absentees. In electorates with both conformist and contrarian agents and varying level of dominance due to local factors, short-term campaigns are effective only in the case of fragile dominance of a single party. Strong local dominance is relatively difficult to influence and long term campaigns with strategies aimed to impact local level politics are seen to be more effective. Introduction Statistical physics inspired models that describe collective phenomena arising from the interaction between the constituents has been an active area of interest in disciplines outside physics, such as in social science [1], [2], [3], [4]. In the field of social science, a fundamental question that these models attempt to study and explore is that of opinion dynamics. The dynamics of opinion change can be typically modeled, as local interactions, over a 2D square lattice or large networks. The nodes of the network, or the cells in the lattice are agents whose values or attributes determine their opinion. In the simplest case, each agent has two choices which are representative of binary opinions. Some of the well- studied social interaction rules, that lead to the change in the values and reflect shaping of opinions include the voter model [5], [6], [7], [8], in which each agent acquires the opinion of a randomly selected neighbor, majority vote model [9], [10], [11], [12] where the agent takes the opinion of the local majority and the Sznajd model [13] which studies the influence of a group on individual’s opinion. Besides a diverse set of rules, the opinions can also be continuous [14], [15], or both discrete and continuous [16]. Social impact and the role of individual’s attitude in the formation of the net opinion is however a complex phenomena [17], [18], [19], [20]. In democracies, elections present a platform for people to express their opinions and hence can be considered as one of the largest experiments on the emergence of consensus (partial) and opinion formation. Elections by themselves are, however, complex processes. Recent works on elections have indeed explored through simple statistical physics models the role of these complex interactions [21], [22], [23]. In addition to the social structure and the interaction rules, individual preference, their intrinsic nature and the available information also play important roles in the formation of voter’s choice [24]. It is not surprising that these factors also influence the strategies of political parties. 11/12/24, 10:25 P M Modeling the nonlinear effects of opinion kinematics in elections: A simple Ising model with random field based study - S cienceDir… https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S 0378437121005604 2/8 Individual traits determine how much an individual may be influenced or can influence others. The process of opinion formation and the distribution of opinions, therefore, depend on the type of traits, such as inflexibles, or those who do not change their opinion easily [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], contrarians [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], whose opinion is against the local majority, influential leader or those with higher influencing ability [37] etc. Political environments and the opinions surrounding them are charged and fluctuating. Political parties through their campaigns, aim to take advantage of this and use media as one of the platforms to disseminate information and their position on various topics. Media therefore acquires an important position and its role and significance in opinion formation has been investigated within various models [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45]. Advances made in modes of digital communications have also made social media platforms an important channel for campaigns and communication. The structure of the information diffusion networks results in rapid dissemination of news and information. Controlling and regulating materials being posted on these platforms is not simple, resulting in spread of misinformation and fake news at an alarming rate [46], [47]. While the level of influence on an individual’s opinion is unclear, they do affect their process of decision making [48]. Given the diversity that exists within an electorate, and the complex competition between the different factors that affect decision making, it becomes important to understand their role within different social structures. Moreover, election results are mostly spot measurement of an unsettled many body system. Strategies and their timings may induce modest shift in the opinions which can change the tipping point or introduce instability [49], [50], [51], thereby changing the political outcome. With all this in the background, in this paper we study the influence of campaign strategies on different types of electorates. Our studies have been motivated by some common observations in campaign strategies, their effect on prevailing voter sentiments and the corresponding influence on regional electoral outcomes in some recent elections in democratic countries. These strategies include, extensive and aggressive use of social media, aggressive campaigning, government response in the presence of extreme background events such as COVID, issues of ethnic equality and to national security threats that may evoke a strong emotional response from the voters etc. Given the prevailing state and nature of the electorate we attempt to understand how the different factors influence the voter’s choice. 11/12/24, 10:25 P M Modeling the nonlinear effects of opinion kinematics in elections: A simple Ising model with random field based study - S cienceDir… https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S 0378437121005604 3/8 The rest of the paper is laid out as follows. In Section 2 we present the model and the interpretation of the different parameters that are used. In Section 3 we present results of our numerical simulation. First we consider a system consisting of only conformist agents in the presence of random field. Here, we also explore the role of inflexibles and the absentees on a quasi-stationary state that results after the removal of field. We then analyze a mixed model with conformist and contrarian agents. Allowing for different levels of dominance of conformists we examine the efficacy of campaigns. Conclusions are presented at the end. Section snippets Model We model a system where every agent has two choices (two party system). Their opinions represented as discrete values in this paper symbolize their support for a party. We adopt a 2D Ising spin system approach, in which the agents are modeled on a lattice. Each cell in the lattice, may be assumed to be an individual or an agent, and the dynamics of opinion formation is mathematically represented as: is the strength of … Results We present results using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with periodic boundary conditions. Simulations have been performed on lattice of size 128 × 128, unless mentioned otherwise, using the Metropolis algorithm. In Section 3.1 we first examine the response of a system with only conformist agents to external influence. We then discuss the effect of perturbations on the consensus observed. In Section 3.2 we consider a modified model with both conformist and contrarian agents. Different levels of … Conclusion In this paper, through models of opinion dynamics, we have qualitatively studied the effect of campaign and strategies on the opinion of an electorate. The different scenarios considered here are inspired by what is observed in real populations as they face competitive regional elections. Two main factors that can play a role in shaping of opinions, local and external influence have been considered. At the local level, the prevailing situation is modeled through the nearest neighbor interaction … 11/12/24, 10:25 P M Modeling the nonlinear effects of opinion kinematics in elections: A simple Ising model with random field based study - S cienceDir… https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S 0378437121005604 4/8 CRediT authorship contribution statement Mukesh Tiwari: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing.
