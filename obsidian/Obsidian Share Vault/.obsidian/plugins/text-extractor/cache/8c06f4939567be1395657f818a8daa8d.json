The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview over the market rules and products at the German wholesale and ancillary service markets. The wholesale power market is introduced in chapter 3. The basic principles of electricity trading on derivative and spot markets are similar to other commodity markets. Commodity trading is typical for metals, coal, agricultural products, crude oil and natural gas. The purpose of derivative market is to hedge risks against unforeseen price developments. The seller of a commodity agrees upfront to pay a price for a specified good at a specified delivery date and the seller agrees to deliver the good at the specified time. These deals can be closed at exchanges or bilaterally between the buyer and the seller, the so-called over-the-counter trade (OTC). The European Energy Exchange (EEX) operates the power derivative market for the market area Germany. An introduction to the derivative markets is given in chapter 3.2 and to OTC trading in chapter 3.3. A closer matching of supply and demand occurs on short-term spot markets that are operated by EPEX SPOT for the German market area. Spot markets establish power prices for every hour and even for every quarter of an hour. Chapter 3.1 introduces to the EPEX SPOT market. However forecast of generation and consumption are not perfect but supply and demand must be in balance every time to keep a constant frequency. For this reason the TSOs procure ancillary services and especially frequency control reserve. Control reserve is an extra market that enables market participants to provide services. This market is explained in chapter 4. On the other hand, imbalances of a market participant are charged with a balancing energy price. The organisational framework of market participants and the charging of imbalances are introduced in chapter 1.

A balancing group accounts traded volumes and generation as well as consumption of measurement points for every quarter of an hour. Every grid connection point has to be allocated to a balancing group within a transmission system operator’s (TSO’s) control area (StromNZV § 4 (3)). In a balancing group the power trades, electricity generation and electricity consumption of a player or a group of players in the energy market are pooled. Every balancing group is identified by an Energy Identification Code (EIC) 1 which is required to conclude a balancing group contract with the respective TSO. Power trades between balancing groups have to be carried out by means of schedules (StromNZV §5 (1)). These schedules have to be sent to the TSO. Additionally a consumption and generation forecast has to be sent to the TSO in form of schedules. These forecasts are the sum of the consumption respectively generation of all energy units that are allocated to the balancing group. These schedules always have to be in balance within the settlement period, this means that the sum of fed-in, drawn-off and exchanged energy has to be zero in each quarter hour. If deviations from this balance occur during the delivering period the balancing group has to buy balancing energy from the TSO to maintain the balance within the balancing group. The exact processing of data and billing is stated in the Market rules for balancing group billing in the area of electricity (MaBiS). Furthermore a power trader needs to implement the obligation to report accordingly to the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) that shall prevent insider-trading and market manipulation on the wholesale energy market. This means that every energy trade has to be reported to ACER (Agency for the Coorporation of Energy Regulators) and insider information (e.g. unplanned non- availability of power plants > 100 MW) has to be published. Obligations to report and clear large financial amounts of derivatives are specified in the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). 2.1 Balancing group contract The balancing contract is a standard contract which is prescribed by formal definitions of the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur 2011) 2. It is concluded between the Balance Responsible Party (BRP) and the operator of the control area. The BRP 1 A short guide to EIC can be found here: https://www.entsoe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/edi/library/eic/eic-short-guide-faq-v1r0.pdf The reference manual to EIC is available under: https://www.entsoe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/edi/library/eic/eic-v4r4.pdf 2 An English version of this contract can be found here: http://www.tennet.eu/de/index.php?eID=pmkfdl&file=fileadmin%2Fdownloads%2FKunden%2FBNetzA- BKC_englisch.pdf&ck=48c0a802ea08e09a09d442421b76ecf4&forcedl=1&pageid=324. Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 6 | 80 Regulatory Framework for Power Markets needs balancing groups and according balancing group contracts in every control area where he is trading or where he is responsible for measurement points. In Germany, there are four control areas operated by the four TSOs TransnetBW, 50Hertz, Tennet and Amprion. A balancing group is created for diverse purposes by utilities, traders, large consumers, distribution system operators or TSOs. A list of balancing groups is published regularly 1. A distribution system operator e.g. operates several balancing groups for the accounting of grid losses, the feed-in of renewable energy sources or the differences of household power purchase and consumption. In the following the main aspects of the balancing group contract are explained 2. As a precondition for the conclusion of a balancing group contract for a balancing group with physical grid connection the grid usage has to be agreed with the responsible distribution grid operator in whose grid the connection points of the balancing group are located. The balancing group contract enables both the feed-in and draw-off of electrical energy within the TSO’s control area as well as the exchange of electrical energy with other balancing groups. The exchange with other balancing groups can be a trade between two different companies within the TSO's control area or a delivery to a balancing group of the same company in another TSO's control area. The BRP has to inform the TSO immediately of the identity of the traders and suppliers who are allocated to its balancing group. The BRP also has to make sure that it is reachable to the extent required for a proper compliance with its contractual duties. The BRP needs to keep the feed-in and the purchase of energy in balance with the draw-off and the sale of energy in every quarter of an hour. For this purpose, the BRP has to keep schedules for the day-ahead planning. Balance deviations are only permitted if they are unpredictable. In case of an unplanned power plant failure the BRP is released from these obligations for four quarter hours including the quarter hour in which the failure occurs. These remaining deviations from the schedules are compensated with balancing energy which is provided by the TSO. The costs for balancing energy are given by a unique and common balancing energy price (regelzonenübergreifender einheitlicher Bilanzausgleichsenergiepreis [reBAP]) which applies symmetrically to the purchase and the delivery of balancing energy. The reBAP is calculated based on the costs for activated control reserves in every quarter hour (see also chapter 4.2). Afterwards the costs for the purchase of balancing energy for every balancing group are calculated by multiplying the imbalance with the reBAP for every quarter hour. If the balancing group has received balancing energy it has to pay the TSO for it. If the balancing group has supplied balancing energy the TSO has to pay the balancing group. The costs of this balancing energy are a risk that can be transferred to another balancing group. With the permission of the other balancing group a subgroup can be created (StromNZV §4 (1)). The account balance is than left at the parent balancing group that could be itself a subgroup of another balancing group (StromNZV §4 (1)). 1 http://www.bdew.de/internet.nsf/id/DE_EIC-Codes-und-VNB-Bilanzkreise, http://www.bdew.de/internet.nsf/id/205ED10B9209489EC1257D570040F5EC/$file/ENTSO-Code_EIC.pdf 2 The balancing group contract may be changed in the near future by the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur 2014b) Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 7 | 80 Regulatory Framework for Power Markets The allocation of balancing groups can only be changed at each 1st day of a calendar month, 0:00, with a notification period of 10 working days. Schedules have to be transmitted from the BRP to the TSO until 14:30 of the previous day and have to contain a balanced quarter hour performance for each quarter hour. Schedules within the German control areas may be changed with minimum advance notice of one quarter hour to each quarter hour of each day. Additionally schedules within the control area of one TSO can be changed subsequently until 4:00 of the following working day. Schedules can be transferred by File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or via ISDN or by email. For the verification of the grid safety the TSO requires the schedule of every power plant unit with a physical electrical capacity more than 100 MW until 14:30 at the previous day. The data for the financial balancing settlement has to be provided according to the enactment BK6-07-002 (MaBiS) of the Federal Network Agency (see also section 3.2). The TSO will publish the reBAP not later than on the 20th working day after the delivery month and will determine the balance deviations of the balancing groups from the 30th working day after the delivery month based on the billing data available at the end of the 29 th working day. The settlement of balancing energy is made on a monthly basis, 42 working days after the delivery month, at the latest.

MaBiS shall ensure an efficient exchange of mass data which is relevant for balancing, as well as a clear and complete mapping of all energy flows in the control areas. This shall result in a high-quality balancing group billing process that is completed within two months after the delivery (TenneT 2014). MaBiS defines different market roles: balance responsible party, supplier, distribution system operator and balance coordinator which is usually the TSO. The figure below gives an overview of the exchange processes between the different market roles. Processes between supplier and balance responsible party are not specified by MaBiS. Data that is exchanged between the market roles can be classified to master data, transaction data, status / check notifications and different lists. Master data in this context means e.g. information about the de-/activation of metering points and different time series. Transaction data contains for example the time series that are used for the balance settlement. Additionally MaBiS governs the deadlines for the different processes. Details are specified in the enactment BK6-07-002 of the Federal Network Agency (TenneT 2014).

The regulation on data reporting implementing Article 8(2) and Article 8(6) of the Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency 1 will probably come into force in the beginning of 2014 (Bundesnetzagentur 2014a). This regulation defines the details of reportable wholesale energy products and fundamental data: • Which data has to be reported • Who has to report such data • When such data must be reported • To whom these data must be reported • How these data must be reported • If there are defined minor limits Summarized all 2 contracts regarding the trading or transport of electricity and natural gas have to be reported to ACER (Agency for the Coorporation of Energy Regulators), whether or not the deal is registered for clearing or the trading takes place on exchanges. If the trading takes place on organised markets (e.g. power exchange) the organised market place should report the required date. The reporting of contract details regarding energy trading is independent of the balancing settlement. Before entering into a contract which has to be reported to ACER the market participants have to register at the regulatory authority in their home country. Already today insider information has to be reported respectively published on the internet. Insider information in this case is all information that could influence the prices for energy products considerably when leaked out. RWE for example publishes the output and availability of all power plants with a capacity of 100 MW and more on its website3. Central obligation of the EMIR regulation is the trade registration for OTC derivatives contracts, which is regulated in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (European Parliament and the Council 7/27/2012). Detailed information that has to be submitted is regulated in Regulation (EU) No 148/2012 (European Commission 2013). All counterparties of all trades have to report their OTC trades to a central transaction register. The information submitted must contain details about the counterparties of the trade (see table 1 in (European Commission 2013)) and information on the trade itself. This includes volumes and prices (see table 2 in (European Commission 2013)). 1 Available here: http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index.cfm?do=search.documentdetail&F+lk9Sf5x6/wlUuSyng ZumOBWhdbDkI2Fc+pLBG2z/MxdbQ+AI/X9VTTMRqv00VG 2 Except contracts of less than 600 GWh/year for the supply of electricity or natural gas of the use of final customers or to a single consumption unit with a technical capability to consume less than 600 GWh/year 3 http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/en/1262622/rwe-npower/about-us/our-businesses/power- generation/generation-output-and-availability/ Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 11 | 80 Regulatory Framework for Power Markets The European Commodity Clearing AG (ECC) offers trade registration to comply with EMIR. Trade registration provides the possibility to conclude a trade at the exchange (compare chapter 3.4). With the registration, bilateral OTC contracts will be converted into standardised exchange derivative contracts and as such are not considered OTC- derivatives under EMIR. The registration can be done via EFETnet's Clearing Registration Service (eXRP) and Trayport’s Clearing Link. ECC’s EMIR Trade Reporting Services are provided for Clearing Members and Non-Clearing Members 1. They allow the submission of reports for derivative transactions that are classified as OTC according to EMIR. 1 For explanation and admission of Clearing Members and Non-Clearing members at ECC see chapter 3.4 Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 12 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets 3 Wholesale Power Markets This chapter will provide information on wholesale electricity trading. This involves the exchange markets as well as the bilateral trading, so-called over-the-counter (OTC) trading. In each market different products are available, giving market participants a variety of trading opportunities. At first the power spot market EPEX SPOT is introduced in chapter 3.1. The power derivative market EEX is introduced in chapter 3.2. Chapter 3.3 introduces briefly to the OTC market. The clearing of financial risks is included to the exchange trade and offered as a service for OTC contracts. An introduction to the clearing hosted by ECC is given in chapter 3.4. Transfer capacities can be reserved for cross-border delivery not traded at EPEX SPOT including market coupling. The transfer capacity auction hosted by CASC.EU is introduced in chapter 3.5. 3.1 Spot market at the European Power Exchange EPEX SPOT Trading on the spot market enables market participants to sell and buy electricity in a non-discriminatory and anonymous environment and ensures the maximization of the social welfare through merit-order dispatch (Jiang Wu et al.). Electricity can be traded in standardized contracts on a day-ahead auction and a continuous intraday trading at the EPEX SPOT. Energy traded in the power exchange markets accounted for 40% of the national electricity consumption in the year 2013 with an increasing trend. The increase in the share can be explained with the increase in generation from renewable energy sources and their need for day-ahead settlement (EPEX SPOT 2014o). Share of trading volume of national EPEX SPOT market in annual national consumption (in %) (EPEX SPOT 2014o) There are three exchange regulations, the code of conduct, the market rules and the operational rules. This set of rules is agreed upon between the exchange operator and 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 0 10 20 30 40 50 YearPercentage Percent age of annual consumpt ion Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 13 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets the market participants and are uniformly applied to all market participants through contracts (EPEX SPOT 2014p). The market rules organize the general exchange organisation and operations procedures. They contain information about the exchange operator, the purpose of the markets as well any fundamental information about the exchange. The operational rules organize the details of the trading systems and the traded products. The operational rules define e.g. tradable contracts, gate-closure-times, price limits, order quantity, block types and further information to trade a product on the exchange. A fair and transparent market operation is ensured by the code of conduct which regulates the behaviour of the exchange members. It also regulates the consequences when the rules are violated. These rules include e.g. an obligation for exchange members to fill in a KYC questionnaire (see chapter 3.1.1.1) or the obligation to alert relevant authorities/market operator on detection of unusual behaviour of any of their counterparties. The way of becoming licensed trader at the exchange is introduced in chapter 3.1.1. The product specifications and market rules of the day-ahead auction and the continuous intraday trading are summarized in chapter 3.1.2. The development of prices is depicted in chapter 3.1.3. 3.1.1 Licensing and licensed contractors The licensing to take part at the EPEX SPOT markets consists of two parts, the admission by the market operator and the admission by the clearing house. Both parts are described in the sections below. There are no further requirements for the participation on EPEX SPOT. A technical qualification for the power marketed is not necessary. Trading on EPEX SPOT is not linked to the availability of physical units delivering or consuming power. 3.1.1.1 Admission by exchange operator Trading on the EPEX SPOT markets require the prior admittance of the exchange operating company as a member of the exchange. The membership is limited to companies only. This process is followed by the acceptance of individual persons which will be admitted as traders. Each individual person has to pass an exam in order to ensure the compliance with the aforementioned rules (code of conduct, market rules and operational rules). The admission to the market enables trading on all market segments. There is no individual admission process for each market. The table below shows the admission process according to (EPEX SPOT 2014a). Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 14 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets Preconditions Details Step 1 Engaging communication with exchange operator and passing on application documents Support by exchange operator for details Step 2 Questionnaire Fill in the “Know Your Customer” questionnaire. Based on this EPEX SPOT will score your company. If the scoring is positive the admission process continues Step 3 First steps A. Find a Clearing Bank (for the company) B. Sign a balance agreement (for the company) C. Take the trader examination (for the employees of the company in admission process) Step 4 Submit documents to EPEX SPOT and ECC Send documents for the admission to EPEX SPOT and ECC. Please note that the admission as CM or NCM by ECC is a separate process and precondition for the admittance by EPEX SPOT Step 5 Check Documents are checked by EPEX SPOT and ECC Step 6 Approval Admittance as EPEX SPOT member 1 Step 7 Technical setup Connection to EPEX SPOT trading system via Internet, VPN or leased line internet connection, offering the following APIs: EPEX SPOT Trading System (ETS), ComXerv (EPEX SPOT 2014g) Steps for the approval process at the EPEX SPOT (EPEX SPOT 2014a) The certification to trade for each individual person is obtained after successful completion of the EPEX SPOT exam. Training for the exam as well as the exam itself can be taken at the EPEX SPOT e-learning platform or at specific dates through the EEX training department. Training courses and exams are only open to employees of EPEX SPOT members or companies in the admission process. Individual persons will only be 1 Membership are admitted or rejected. Different levels in accordance to risk or market activity are not envisioned since it would not comply with anonymous markets principle. Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 15 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets certified if the company in the admission process is admitted as a full EPEX SPOT member (EPEX SPOT 2014m). Qualification of traders for the participation on the energy exchange can be obtained through the training module “EPEX SPOT trading handbook”. This includes operational aspects of the power market, rules and regulation, products, day-ahead and intraday details, online trading demos, fall-back procedures and various studies and analyses. It enables the traders to be examined by EPEX SPOT so they can trade on EPEX SPOT’s markets (day-ahead or intraday) on behalf of an admitted company. The trader can only participate in the market if the company is admitted to the market and the trader has passed the traders exam. The conditions of the exam are as stated (EPEX SPOT 2014d): • The exam consists of 25 multiple-choice questions to be answered within 30 minutes • The trader knows whether he/she passed at the end of the exam and can start trading immediately after being registered in the EPEX SPOT Customer Centre • Three attempts per trainee are authorized • The trading certification is available as PDF in the E-Learning platform and can be downloaded at any time • The trading certification is personal, valid for a lifetime even if the person changes employer, in which case the new company needs to be admitted for trading at EPEX SPOT already Then trading access is granted by the Customer Centre (EPEX SPOT 2014d): • New traders have to be registered in the EPEX SPOT Customer Centre prior to starting to trade in order to get their trading accounts for the trading systems • After registration in the Customer Centre, EPEX SPOT’s market operations validate member’s request and set-up the new trader in the trading systems. Afterwards, the trader receives his login details by email. • The Customer Centre is a tool used by EPEX SPOT’s members to save contact details of their staff involved in the power (EPEX SPOT 2014m)activity. • Each member has appointed at least one person responsible for maintaining and updating the Customer Centre. EPEX SPOT offers additional training courses.

The exchange members are based in the following sectors: Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 17 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets EPEX SPOT Membership by sector (EPEX SPOT 2014n) Third-party trading is permitted on EPEX SPOT markets. This enables smaller companies to assign broker. EPEX SPOT states that small companies suffer significant costs of market access if they take part directly at the exchange without broker (EPEX SPOT 2014n). A list EPEX SPOT exchange members offering market access for non-members can be found in (EPEX SPOT 2014i). There is a fee of 25,000 EUR for once getting access and additionally annual fees of 10,000 EUR per market area 1 including auction and intraday market or 5,000 EUR per market segment for the intraday market only (EPEX SPOT 2014e). Furthermore (EPEX SPOT 2014e) lists several annual fees for different ways to get access to the EPEX trading system (ETS) applied for the auction or to ComXerv applied for the intraday market. 3.1.1.2 Admission by clearing house All contracts traded on the EPEX SPOT are cleared and settled by the European Commodity Clearing AG (ECC). ECC takes the role as the counterparty between the buyer and the seller and takes on the financial risk of the participants 2. In case of failure of one clearing member ECC guarantees the payment. The provision of security is paid for by the clearing members with a premium, known as collateral requirements or margin. The height of the premium is based on the risk assessment of the customer by the ECC. ECC is also responsible for the financial and physical settlement 3. Companies 1 Auction market areas are Germany/Austria, Switzerland or France. German and Austrian intraday market is included in the fee for German/Austrian auction. 2 Physical risks of non-delivery or non-consumption are penalised with balancing energy price und the balancing group contract, as described in chapter 2.1 3 ECC is responsible for the physical settlement of traded or registered contracts. The settlement includes the scheduling of the local markets of ECC’s partner exchanges for the TSOs and the nomination of cross-border power transmissions as part of European market coupling projects, such as PCR. ECC submits information to Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 18 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets trading at EPEX SPOT have to be admitted as Non-Clearing-Members and/or Clearing- Members by ECC. Only clearing members (CM) can trade individually on the ECC associated markets, such as EPEX SPOT or EEX. The markets are operated by ECC partner exchanges Central European Gas Hub (CEGH), European Energy Exchange (EEX), EPEX SPOT SE, HUPX Ltd., Powernext SA and POWER EXCHANGE CENTRAL EUROPE, A.S. (PXE). Every other market participant is a non-clearing member (NCM) and has to have a contractual relationship with a Clearing member. The admittance by EEC as a NCM is a prerequisite for the admittance for trading at EPEX SPOT (EPEX SPOT 2014a). Admittance at EPEX SPOT however has to be achieved separately. Non-clearing members do not own a clearing license. They only can take part in the clearing process as a client of a clearing member. This relationship is regulated by the clearing conditions and the NCM agreement. The CM ensures financial settlement. Physical settlement is arranged by ECC. In total there are 17 clearing members in the market Germany/Austria of EPEX SPOT (status July 2014). Details on how a company can be admitted as a CM or NCM are explained in chapter 3.4. The following table shows the EEC accredited clearing members of EPEX SPOT (EPEX SPOT 2014h): the exchange members in the post trading period about acquired amounts.

An individual price for every hour is determined in this auction. The sections below point out orders, product details and the price determination. In the future day-ahead auction trading will be possible for 15-minute-intervals additionally. There will be 96 quarter-of-an-hour contracts in an additional daily auction. The trader will be able to trade one-hour interval contract and afterwards 15-minute interval contracts (EPEX SPOT 2014n). Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 20 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets Orders Orders are submitted by exchange members via the ETS client. The orders placed in the trading system need to fulfil specified conditions. Traders in the EPEX SPOT day-ahead market can place single-contract orders or block orders. All orders and transactions are anonymous. The order book is closed each day at noon, from when on orders cannot be changed and are binding. Single-contract orders are only valid for one of the 24 hours and block orders for a defined combination of hours (EPEX SPOT 2014e). Every hour that is intended to be traded individually needs an own single contract order. Single contract orders are placed as a monotonous demand curve with up to 256 price- quantity combinations that limit the volume at a specific price. The curve is interpolated linearly between the entered price-quantity combinations as in the following graph. It shows a generic offer curve with it’s up to 256 price-quantity combinations. Example of an individual offer curve at EPEX SPOT representing the up to 256 possible price-quantity combinations Buy volumes have no sign, sell volumes are signed with a minus. A monotonous curve means that an increasing amount to buy must be entered with a decreasing price and an increasing amount to sell must be entered with an increasing price. Prices are specified in steps of 0.1 EUR/MWh and volumes in steps of 0.1 MW. Negative prices must be indicated with a minus. The entered prices must lie in-between the minimum and the maximum price of the exchange market (table product details below) (EPEX SPOT 2014e). Different types of order can be placed in the market for different types of orders (EPEX SPOT 2014e): • Unlimited orders (single-contract or block) also called market orders or price- independent orders. They must contain equal quantities for the minimum and the maximum order price boundaries. These orders are fulfilled at any price. • Limit order (single-contract or block) have a price limit and are only executed if the market prices matches the specified price or is better for the trader • All or none block orders are only executed if the market price for the entire volume matches the specified price or is better for the trader. Otherwise the order would be rejected P1 P2 P3 P256 P255 P254 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q254 Q255 Q256 … Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 21 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets Price-independent orders are placed e.g. by the TSO for the renewable energy feed-in in their own balancing group 1 or by market participants who aim towards a physical fulfilment of financial futures 2 (EPEX SPOT 2014e),(EEX 2012a). Block orders contain one price per order but may have different quantities for each time interval. According to this several consecutive hours can be traded as a whole. There are pre-defined block orders that can be chosen in the order system (EPEX SPOT 2014e): Possible block orders of the day-ahead auction at EPEX SPOT (EPEX SPOT 2014e) 1 The TSOs are managing a balancing group for the RES units that are reimbursed with the feed-in tariff through the German Renewables Act (EEG) 2 Applicable for seller and buyer 1 to 24 9 to 20 1 to 6 7 to 10 11 to 14 11 to 16 15 to 18 19 to 24 17 to 20 1 to 8 21 to 24 9 to 16 1 to 4 5 to 8 9 to 12 13 to 16 1 3 4 5 6 72 8 10 11 12 13 149 15 17 18 19 20 2116 22 23 24 Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 22 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets Specification Product detail Trading procedure / days Daily Auction / Year-round Tradable Contracts 1 hour of the day Hour 01: the period between midnight and 1:00, Hour 02: the period between 1:00 and 2:00, and so on and so forth Order Book opening / Trading session opens 45 days before Delivery Day Order Book closes / Trading closes Daily at 12:00 for the next day Publication time As soon as possible from 12:42 for preliminary results; Binding final results will be published between 12:55 and 13:50 1 Minimum and maximum prices -500.00 EUR/ 3000.0 EUR Minimum price increment 0.1 EUR/MWh Minimum Volume Increment 0,1MW Order quantity One order with at least 2 and not more than256 price/quantity combinations Trading fee 0.04 EUR/MWh EPEX SPOT day-ahead auction contracts specifications (EPEX SPOT 2014e) Price determination The orders are auctioned daily after the closure of the order book. The price is determined through matching of the exchange members' aggregated supply and demand curves 2 for each time interval consisting of single orders and block orders. Block orders are only considered to be part of the aggregated demand and supply curves if they can be executed completely. The price determined by the trading system is the price at which the highest volume will be executed, the so-called market clearing price. Afterwards, the price is determined considering the market-coupling with other spot market auctions (see chapter 3.1.4). The consideration of all constraints can lead to a different market price since the aggregated demand and supply curves may differ 1 Time between order book closure the publishing of the results is needed for the calculation. The calculation of the market settlement requires computing-intense processes that differ with the amount on bids entered into the trading system. 2 Aggregated curves are the sum of all individual curves (demand or supply). Each one of them can consist of up 256 price-quantity combinations Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 23 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets from the initial solution. The market clearing price will be set where both curves intersect. In this point the traded volume will be the highest, which is also called quantity allocation. This entire process of price determination is called market clearing (EPEX SPOT 2014e). The market price and all order prices after price matching and quantity allocation are rounded to 0.01 EUR/MWh. For that purpose the exchange member's interest is assumed to be linear between two price-quantity combinations. The matching algorithm also matches the prices with other market areas, including network constraints on subsea cables. The matching algorithm executes sell orders that are lower or equal to the market price and buy orders above or equal the market price. Orders equal to the market price may be partially executed or not at all. If the matching algorithm does not generate a valid market price (e.g. insufficient liquidity) a second auction is performed. This should give the exchange members the chance to change their orders to improve the situation 1. The results of the joint German/Austrian market area shall be published and validated not later than 14:00 2 (EPEX SPOT 2014e). Post trading period In the post trading period the market participants receive notice from the exchange operator about the traded amounts. The exchange members are responsible for transferring the market results into schedules for the TSO themselves. The exchange members forward the results to the corresponding balancing responsible party for the creation of schedules. Balance responsible parties have to fill in the form for the schedule using the exchange operator as a counterpart to balance positions. The energy exchange is a balancing group itself. The traded amount on the exchange has to match the amounts in the exchange schedule of the balance responsible party. If the schedules are not balanced, they are rejected by the TSO, preventing imbalances prior to production. The balancing responsible party’s equilibrium of physical production, consumption and trading is covered by the balancing group contract and the MaBiS processes (section 2.1 and 2.2). Ultimately trading on the exchange is a separate process to the obligations from the balancing group contract. 3.1.2.2 Intraday continuous trading Intraday trading on EPEX SPOT intraday markets is executed on two different markets. These two markets differ in the product length. The trader can choose to trade one- hour contracts or 15-minute contracts. The basic principles of both the markets are similar. Opposed to the day-ahead auction intraday market contracts are traded continuously starting the day before physical settlement at 15:00. Last opportunity to trade is 45 minutes before the physical settlement. The following information is equally 1 The second auction is performed after the publishing of the results before the start of the intraday trading. Second auctions for EPEX SPOT day-ahead markets are not happening often. In fact, the requirement of a second auction is a sign of illiquidity of the markets which is not the case in the EPEX SPOT day-ahead market. 2 Including the second auction and before the start of the intraday trading. Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 24 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets valid for one-hour contracts and the 15-minute contracts. For differences between the contract types, see the tables in this chapter (EPEX SPOT 2014e). Similar to the day-ahead auction the traders can place different orders in the intraday markets. Traders can place limit orders to buy or sell electricity which are only carried out at this price or a better price. Limit orders must contain information about the trading direction (buy/sell), the expiry date, quantity, price limit and the delivery area (TSO). Traders can also place market sweep orders to trade several contiguous single- contracts which are similar to block contracts in the day-ahead auction. The price however is matched with single contracts only. This means that some hours might be executed and some are not 1. Limit orders must contain information about the trading direction (buy/sell), the expiry date, quantity, price limit and the delivery area (TSO). In addition to sweep orders, pre-defined block orders can be placed (EPEX SPOT 2014e): • Block Baseload covering hours 1 to 24 • Block Peakload covering hours 9 to 20 The order book is open twenty-four hours a day throughout the year. EPEX SPOT however has the right to close the order at any time. The information from the order book communicated from the exchange to the exchange members for each contract during the trading session. This includes all bid and ask limit orders, details of the last trade, price, quantity and the time of execution. The single contract orders (including sweep orders) are entered in a central open and anonymous order book. Block order are handled in a separate order book. Orders are submitted electronically to the trading system (EPEX SPOT 2014e). Depending on the order’s price limit and quantity and on the order book configuration, any single contract within the time range may not be executed since it cannot be matched with a counter position. This means that contracts in some hours are executed where others are not. In addition to this the executed volume may vary for each individual single contract since it can be possible that the counter position does not have the matching volume. The orders placed in the trading system need to fulfil specified conditions. Prices in limit orders must lie in-between the minimum and the maximum price of the exchange market (see tables lower in this chapter). Negative prices must be indicated with a “-“. Prices must be rounded to 0.01 EUR/MWh. Orders can be entered with the following execution restrictions (EPEX SPOT 2014e): • “Immediate-or-cancel” (IOC): Either the order is immediately executed or automatically cancelled. The order can be partially executed and any unexecuted quantity is cancelled. IOC orders are not entered in the order book. Market sweep orders are orders with the restriction IOC. • “Fill-or-kill” (FOK): The order is either immediately and entirely executed or cancelled in its entirety. FOK orders are not entered in the order book. • “All-or-none” (AON): The order is executed completely or not at all. AON orders remain in the order book until they are executed or cancelled. orders can be entered with the following validity restrictions (EPEX SPOT 2014e): 1 The block order would be executed fully or not at all (Fill-or-Kill condition) Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 25 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets • “Good for session”: The order is deleted on the trading end date and time of the contract, unless it is matched, deleted or deactivated beforehand • “Good till date”: The order is deleted on the date and time specified by the Exchange Member when submitting the order, unless it is matched, deleted or deactivated beforehand. • “Iceberg” or hidden-quantity: An iceberg order is a large order, divided into several smaller orders which are entered in the order book sequentially. The Exchange Member specifies the total quantity and the initial quantity. o The first order relates to the initial quantity o The hidden quantity is then executed through a series of orders. Each order relates to the same quantity as the initial quantity and there are as many orders as needed to cover the hidden quantity. Each successive order is treated as a new order in terms of priority in the order book. In case of quantity mismatch the event of an odd lot1 happens. This may lead to quantities of the last order being smaller than the initial quantity. After the submission of the orders to the trading system they are matched with other orders in the order book. Matching takes places and orders are executed at the best price available in the system, ensuring that order matching rules or priority rules are not violated. Cross-border trades are possible through market coupling between the market areas Germany, France, Austria and Switzerland. However special rules apply, including restrictions of 15-minute contracts only to countries with similar contracts or the consideration of different gate-closure times 2 in the individual markets. On any other cross-border transmission capacity energy is traded explicitly. The intraday trading system ComXerv facilitates the cross-border trading. Cross-border trading first took place in December 2010 between Germany and France, the Austrian market joined in October 2012 and ultimately Switzerland joined in June 2013 (EPEX SPOT 2014l). Market coupled trades do not require special actions by the participants. However it is possible that orders are cancelled because of unavailable transmission capacity. The transmission capacity that was available at the time of order creation could be occupied at a later point. This can happen when a different order is matched earlier or the transmission capacity is no longer available due to technical constraints. Orders may be cancelled or reduced due to that reason. The event of an increase in cross-border capacities and simultaneously sale order prices in the local order book being lower than purchase order prices in the cross-border order book triggers an auction and stops continuous trading. After this auction continuous trading is resumed (EPEX SPOT 2014e). Based on a risk assessment and scoring of the clearing houses each single exchange member is assigned a trading limit 3. This limits the monetary value that can be traded 1 This is the case when the bid from the iceberg order doesn’t have matching quantities on the opposite site 3 Information on the scoring system and the results are subject to individual contracts between the clearing house and the trading member and therefore are confidential. Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 26 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets by each exchange member between two settlement days.

The downward curve is the demand curve and the upward curve is the supply curve. The intersection of the blue lines on the left graph at the price PA and the quantity QA is the market equilibrium in the local market (market A). The intersection of the blue lines on the right side shows the market equilibrium in the neighbouring market (market B) with the equilibrium price PB and the equilibrium quantity QB. Both sides show market prices in isolated markets. Market A has a lower price than market B. If both markets are coupled and the merit-order list are joined the demand curve in market A shifts upwards since the cumulated demand curve from both markets increases the demand. This is due to the fact that market B has access to lower electricity prices now. In the same time the supply curve shifts downwards in market B since it is less beneficial to produce at lower prices. This increases the electricity prices in market A. In conclusion one can say that market coupling harmonizes market prices and therefore encourages the most efficient unit commitment. (den Ouden, Jean Verseille 1/6/2011) The resulting gain in social welfare is published by the EPEX SPOT for CWE region (EPEX SPOT 2014b). In order to increase the social welfare and efficiency of markets it is necessary to incorporate as many participants in the market as possible. Ideally all market participants would be trading on the same market platform. Due to grid constraints and other barriers, markets are locally segmented though. These segmented markets can be brought together by the means of market coupling. Market coupling optimizes the allocation process of cross-border capacities. Exchange members do not have to care about transmission capacity. It is also called implicit trading. The available transmission capacity is determined by the TSO through grid calculations. This happens for the annual and month-by-month basis using seasonal values and for the day-ahead and intraday capacities on a flow-based grid calculation (EPEX SPOT 2013). The different exchanges who participate in the market coupling use the available cross- border transmission capacity. Supply and demand curves of the different market areas can be aggregated. Depending on the available transmission capacity the price difference is minimized. This means that prices increase in the market areas with the low prices and prices decrease in the market areas with high prices. Bottlenecks will Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 32 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets lead to market splitting and merit order lists in the different market to be different, which changes the order of dispatch of power plants. Since February 4, 2014 there is a market coupling of northern west Europe (NWE). NWE replaces former market couplings such as the CWE coupling and the coupling of CWE to the Nordic region via Interim Tight Volume Coupling (ITVC). NWE is based on the initiative Price Coupling of Regions (PCR) of the power exchanges APX, Belpex, EPEX SPOT, GME, Nord Pool Spot, OMIE and OTE. NWE covers the countries: • Nordic region: Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden • Great Britain • CWE region: Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg, Netherlands Baltic states and Poland are not directly involved but they are coupled to the Nordic market via NordPoolSpot 1 (NPS) (EPEX SPOT 2014k). Furthermore, power markets of Portugal, Spain and France (SWE) are coupled by applying the PCR solution hence keeping the explicit trading algorithm 2. Explicit trading means that energy and transmission capacities are allocated separately (CASC.EU 2014e). The long term goal is a market coupling of the entire European Union. The PCR solution has been developed by European Power Exchanges to provide a single algorithm and harmonised operational procedures for efficient price calculation and use of European cross-border transmission capacity, calculated and offered to the market in a coordinated way by TSOs (Beckman 2014). The NWE market coupling is realized by the implementation of the algorithm \"Euphemia\" (EU + Pan-European Hybrid Electricity Market Integration Algorithm) to calculate market prices, net positions and flows on interconnectors between market areas (PCR 2014a, 2014b). The algorithm is applied to couple the day-ahead spot market of power exchanges. 3.2 Futures and other derivatives at the European Energy Exchange EEX The EEX is an exchange for energy and energy-related products. Trading on the EEX enables traders to sell and buy electricity in the form of a variety of products in a non- discriminatory and anonymous environment. A variety of electricity derivatives can be traded freely in standardized contracts on a regular basis. The products tradable on the EEX are listed in the table below (EEX 2014c). Derivatives can include a physical delivery of the specified good or merely hedge the risks of price volatility. These derivatives are called forward contracts. Standardized forwards traded on the energy exchange are futures and options. The future sells the 1 NPS is the market operator in the ENTSO-E Regional Group Nordic (Eastern Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) equivalent to EPEX SPOT. 2 The PCR solution couples different market coupled areas. “PCR will operate without offering capacity at the French-Spanish border to the price coupling, so the daily explicit auction on this border will be maintained as it is today. The final step in SWE integration will take place when all legal, regulatory and IT conditions are satisfied. The daily explicit auctions will then stop and PCR will then offer the implicit day-ahead allocation for the French-Spanish border.” (CASC.EU 2014e) Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 33 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets commodity in advance whereas the option gives the buyer the right to buy the good at a certain price at a time in the future.

Analogue to the rules and regulations on the EPEX SPOT markets the EEX has implemented statutes that organize the market as a whole. The exchange rules contain the essential rules for the organisation of the exchange as well as the preconditions for access to trading. The EEX admission rules regulate the market access. The trading conditions provide information on the trading and, including the definition of order and the execution of orders (EEX 2012a). Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 34 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets 3.2.1 Licensing and licensed contractors The admission process is designed to enable traders to gain access to the exchange and it is similar to the admission process at the EPEX SPOT. In order to gain access to the exchange the preconditions for admission as a trading participant on EEX must be fulfilled. These preconditions can be found in Art. 14 of the EEX Exchange Rules and in Art. 19 (4) of the German Exchange Act (BörsG). Admission will be granted separately for the individual markets and products of the exchange. This is different in the EPEX SPOT admission. Trading on the EEX is only possible after the successful admittance. Analogue to the EPEX SPOT it is necessary to be recognized as a trading participant by European Commodity Clearing AG (ECC), the EEX clearing house. The recognition as a non-clearing member (NCM) by ECC has its own approval process, as presented in chapter 3.1.1.2. Admission ensures that settlement, delivery and hedging of the transactions will be secured by the clearing house. In return ECC guarantees the fulfilment of transactions. The preconditions for admission to all EEX products, including futures and options, are as following (EEX 2014a): • “Proof of personal reliability and professional qualifications of the person/s holding management authority • Liable equity of at least 50,000 EUR • Admission of at least one trader who has proven personal reliability and who has provided proof of the required professional qualification (e.g. through the EEX trader examination) • Technical connection to the trading systems • Recognition as a trading participant by the clearing house of EEX, European Commodity Clearing AG (ECC)” Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 35 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets The admission process is a presented in the following table (EEX 2014a): Preconditions Details Step 1 Engaging communication with exchange operator and passing on application documents Support by Exchange operator for details Step 2 Training of employees in market rules and code of conduct Trader training and exam for the contracts that are going to be traded Step 3 Technical implementation of connection to the market operator Various options are offered as APIs over Internet, VPN or leased line connections: EEX GlobalVision SM Screen, Trayport TGW to GV Portal (EEX), Eurex T7 GUI (incl.

Each individual Phelix Future is financial derivative of the EPEX SPOT electricity market (EEX 2012b). The individual futures are available as base load, peak load and off-peak contracts for varying maturities (lead time before fulfilment). The delivery periods offered for trading are for the single day, weekends, weeks, months, quarters of a year and entire years. The fulfilment is intended to be carried out financially only, which is then settled in payments between the future price and the market price at EPEX SPOT. A physical delivery however can be arranged for the Phelix Week and Months futures by the exchange operator. The wish for physical delivery needs to be expressed by filling out the bidding forms “Physical Fulfilment Month / Week Futures“. Confirmation needs be given by the exchange operator for the physical fulfilment to take place (EPEX SPOT 2010, 2014c). Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 36 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets Traders in the EEX futures market can trade different block orders with different time horizons. All orders and transactions are anonymous. Depending on the traded future the order book is closed before or after the corresponding trade in the EPEX SPOT markets and differs for each individual EEX Phelix Future (EEX 2014b). Details on the trading times can be found in the last paragraph of this chapter. Phelix Futures are traded in EUR/MWh continuously until their maturity. Traded volumes in MWh must be rounded to the second decimal place, forming a minimum price increment of 0.01 MWh. Prices must be rounded to 0.01 EUR/MWh. The delivery time of a future describes the days and their hours that are traded for each delivery period. The following delivery times can be traded on EEX Phelix futures (EEX 2014b): • Base future with a delivery time between 00:00 and 24:00 for all days of the week (Base) • Peak future with a delivery time between 08:00 until 20:00 in two variants: o Peak: All working days (Monday till Friday) between 08:00 and 20:00 o Peak Weekend: On Saturday and Sunday between 08:00 and 20:00 • Off-Peak future with a delivery time from 00:00 until 08:00 and 20:00 until 24:00 for all days from Monday till Friday and the hours between 00:00 and 24:00 at weekends EEX Phelix Futures are traded for different delivery periods. The delivery periods for the futures differ with the delivery time. Possible delivery periods are days, weekends, weeks, months, quarter years and years. Following table shows the possible combinations (EEX 2014b): Base Peak Off-Peak Day X X Weekend X X Week X X Month X X X Quarter X X X Year X X X Possible combinations of delivery times and delivery periods (EEX 2014b) The term “tradable maturities” describes the time span a future can be traded before its time of fulfilment. It marks the earliest possibility to trade a contract. Traded volumes and liquidity of each contract are usually higher the closer the contract is to its delivery. The following maturities can be traded at EEX (EEX 2014b): • Day Futures can be traded for the next 34 days • Weekend Futures can be traded for the next 5 weekends • Week Futures can be traded for the next 4 weeks • Month Futures can be traded for the current month and the next 9 months • Quarter Futures can be trade for the next 11 full quarters • Year Futures can be traded for the next 6 full years Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 37 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets The volume of a contract is determined by multiplying the number of delivery days in the delivery period with the quantity to be delivered daily. 1 MW contracted as a base future translates into the delivery of 24 MWh per day. Contracts are only tradable in integer numbers (integer numbers of MW). This means minimum volume increment of day base future is at least 24 MWh. A year base future contracts of 1 MW then contracts 8760 MWh (EEX 2014b). The last trading day of EEX Phelix futures is different dependent on the chosen contract. The last trading day could also be during the current delivery period. In case the indicated date is not an exchange trading day at EPEX SPOT the last trading day for the futures is the previous trading day. For day futures the last trading day is at the day of the hourly auction at EPEX SPOT. Weekend futures are traded until the Friday before the delivery period. For the Base Week Future the last trading day is the Friday of the current delivery period, i.e. the Friday is the 5th day of the delivery period and the consumption has already taken place from Monday to Thursday. The Peak Week Future is traded until the Thursday of the current delivery period. The last trading day of the Month Future is the day when the hourly auction for the last delivery day of the delivery month on the EPEX SPOT market is conducted. Trading ends at the time of the end of the submission of bids for the hourly auction on the EPEX SPOT day-ahead market on that day. The last trading day of the Quarter and Year Future is the third exchange trading day before the beginning of the delivery period (EEX 2014b).

An EEX Phelix Option is a contract which gives the buyer the right to buy or sell electricity at a specified strike price at a specific time or time period. The paid price is called option premium. After the purchase of an option contract it is strictly mandatory for the buyer to pay the price of the option premium on the ECC Business Day after the purchase. The premium shall be credited to the seller on the same day (EEX 2014b). Since Phelix Options are so called “European Options” the buyer only has the right to exercise the option at a specified point in time, not within a time span (which would be called “American option”). This means that the buyer on an option contract can exercise the option e. g. only on the last trading day. The seller receives the option premium and has the obligation to sell or buy the electricity at the strike price. This only happens if the buyer decides to exercises the option. Options which provide the owner with the right to buy electricity at the strike price are also named call (options) whereas options which provide the buyer with the right to sell electricity at the strike price are called put (options). EEX offers options with different strike prices for the same underlying and maturity, called tradable option series. The trading is continuous as in intraday and futures markets of EPEX SPOT and EEX. Trading principles and price matching do not differ from these markets. The possible trading positions are summarized by EEX as follows (EEX 2014b): • “The buyer of a call option (call) is entitled to receive a long position in the corresponding future 3 at the exercise price of the option on the last trading day 4. • The seller of the call option (call) receives a short position in the corresponding future after the call option is exercised and assigned at the exercise price on the last trading day.” 1 Note that futures are traded as contracts, i.e. one contract of Day Base Future is the delivery of 24 MWh. 2 Day base futures translate into the delivery of 24 MWh per day. Contracts are only tradable in integer numbers (integer numbers of MW). 3 The buyer has the right to buy the future for strike price. 4 The option is exercised on the last trading day but the price is fixed at the time of the trade. Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 40 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets • They buyer of a put option 1 (put) is entitled to receive a short position in the corresponding future at the exercise price of the option on the last trading day. • The seller of the put option 2 (put) receives a long position in the corresponding future at the exercise price after the put option is exercised and assigned on the last trading day 3.” The tradable options are the Base Year Option, the Base Quarter Option and the Base Month Option, which are based on the corresponding Phelix Futures considering the maturity. The maturity is based on the delivery period of the corresponding future. This means that the acquisition of a Call Phelix Base Year 2015 Option entitles the buyer to the delivery of a 2015 Phelix Base Year Future for the strike price. Phelix Base Month Future and Phelix Base Quarter Future, have the same maturity as the underlying Phelix Futures. Phelix Base Year Future is based on the year that follows the respective expiry date of the option (EEX 2014b). Similarly to the maturities of the Phelix Futures different maximum maturities also apply to the Phelix Options that can be traded on the EEX. The Month Option can be traded for the next 5 delivery months. The Phelix Quarter Option can be traded for the next 6 delivery quarters and the Phelix Year Option can be traded for the next 3 or 4 delivery years. The varying maturities exist due to fact that for each delivery year up to 4 contracts with different expiry dates can exist 4 (EEX 2014b). As the Phelix Options are “European options” they can only be exercised at the last trading day. If the buyer wishes to execute notice to the EEX system must be given between 08:00 and 15:00 on this very date. Starting at 14:00 with the start of the intraday trading the fixing price is set and published before 15:00 on the last trading day. Exercises only become effective at 15:00, until that time they can be changed or deleted at any time. The option expires if it has not been exercised by then (expiry day) (EEX 2014b). 1 The buyer obtains the right to sell the future for strike price. The buyer is on the passive side of the option contract. 2 The seller is obliged to buy the electricity from the trader with the call option upon exercise of the option. The buyer is on the passive side of the option contract. 3 Similarly to the aforementioned, except the fact that the passive side of the option is obliged to buy the electricity on exercise of the option. 4 “For each delivery year of the underlying up to 4 contracts with different expiry dates at the end of each quarter of the preceding year are available. For each underlying are available: Expiry end of March: Phelix Base Year Apr Option Expiry end of June: Phelix Base Year Jul Option Expiry end of September: Phelix Base Year Oct Option Expiry end of December: Phelix Base Year Jan Option New maturities will be introduced for trading to such an extent that always 12 maturities referring to the next 3 or 4 delivery years of the underlying are tradable.” (EEX 2014b) Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 41 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets Specification Product detail Trading procedure / days Continuous / Year-round on trading days: Monday - Friday between 08:00 and 18:00 Tradable Contracts • Base Year Option 1 • Base Quarter Option • Base Month Option 2 Base: 00:00 until 24:00 for all days of the week (Base) Order Book opening / Trading session opens Maximum maturities: • Month Option: Next 5 delivery months • Quarter Option: Next 6 delivery quarters • Year Option: next 3 or 4 delivery years 3 Order Book closes / Trading closes Trading days are the same as the corresponding Phelix Futures.

More than one year ahead of the delivery period the traded volume decreases significantly. It decreases even further when the delivery period is more than two years into the future. The following shows the Phelix Base Year Future for the Year from the beginning of the trade to the last day of the trade.

In fact more than 60 % of the consumed energy is not traded via an exchange. Trades usually are done bilaterally, with the optional help of a broker mediating the trade. OTC transactions can take place without further formal framework conditions. Both counterparties need to be associated with a balancing group to account for the electricity traded. It is possible, but not necessary, that both counterparties are in the same balancing group. Most certainly there will be two balancing group since it is more likely that two different companies have different balancing groups. Chapter 2.1 provides links to a regularly updated list balancing groups. The OTC contract conditions such as time and power are not standardized. The price and the other conditions are negotiated between the involved parties. Market information service companies provide an indication of wholesale power prices, especially OTC prices. The exchange prices (spot and derivatives) serve as a reference, too (Kalantzis, Milonas 2013; Michetti 2012). Framework contracts can be closed to simplify transactions. The European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET) worked out standardized framework contracts 1. Clearing is not mandatory and often the balancing group contract and other regulatory frameworks are relied upon. However, brokers 2 that are accredited at the EEX assign OTC transaction to the clearing by EEX and its subsidiary ECC, respectively (see chapter 3.4). The accredited brokers and their contact data are listed on the EEX homepage3. The company names of the power product brokers are: • BGC Partners • CIMD • GFI Securities Limited • Global Commodities • Griffin Commodity Markets • ICAP Energy AS • OTCex SA UK Branch • Shard Capital Partners LLP • Spectron Energy Services • TFS Derivatives Ltd. • Tradition Dubai • Tullett Prebon (Europe) Ltd. Further, widely-used forms of OTC transactions are supply contracts for smaller utilities or customers. There are typical forms of such contracts. The purpose of differentiating 1 http://www.efet.org/Standardisation/Legal-EFET-Standard-Contracts-and-Documentation/Electricity-And- Electricity-Annexes 2 Applies to Clearing and Non-Clearing Members. Different rules apply depending on the status and the counterpart, respectively. 3 https://www.eex.com/de/handel/broker Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 46 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets these contracts is the allocation of risks. There are full supply contracts, open supply contracts or contracts for tranches. • The full supply contract delivers the complete demand at fix prices. The seller has the balancing risk and the risk of volatile prices. The buyer has the risk of a fix price determined at closing the contract. • The open supply contract enables the customer to buy tranches from other suppliers. The balancing risk stays with the seller of the open supply contract. • With a contract for tranches, the customer is free to choose the time for buying single tranches and thus can manage the price risk. The price of each tranche is fixed at the time of calling. However the customer has also to manage the short-term matching of his demand. Trading possibilities in the OTC market include the trading of spot market products, such as day-ahead deliveries or even intraday adjustments. In addition to the short term trading it is possible to close deals on the long term delivery of electricity. The majority of deals in the OTC market involve long term delivery contracts rather than short term balancing, which could lead to liquidity problems. Liquidity problems arise from the difficulties to find a trading partner in non-organized markets, hence the following OTC trading platforms. Long term contracts usually are analogous to the futures and options traded on the exchange. Together with the exchange traded derivatives these contracts are called forwards. (Lichtblick 2013; Michetti 2012) 3.3.1 Online trading platforms for OTC Brokers can offer electronic platforms to enter transactions in addition to the service by telephone. This chapter introduces two additional possibilities to trade energy via online platforms. Technically the following trading opportunities count as OTC trading. However the presented platforms provide an organizational setup to facilitate trading. These platforms can be seen as an intermediate between the pure face-to-face OTC trading and the exchange market. Especially for small and medium sized companies these platforms provide a good solution since access can be gained relatively easy and cost-effective as compared to the exchanges. The two following platforms however are examples; there might be other solutions available which are more suitable for the company’s needs. 3.3.1.1 IntradayS IntradayS is an internet platform to show power and natural gas offers of participants (Power2Energy 2013a). Trades are performed as OTC. The parties have closed a framework contract in advance (Power2Energy 2013b). The non-profit platform supports the OTC trading for a lot of utilities, power plant operators, industrial companies, suppliers, distributors, portfolio manager and traders of power from renewable energy sources. These companies are located in Germany and abroad but the market area is Germany. In total 85 participants from all over Europe and their market activities in Germany are registered on this platform. The platform can be accessed on www.intradaysmarket.eu (Power2Energy 2014a). Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 47 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets The IntradayS market is a non-commercial cooperation project that aims at granting access for the users to existing scheduling and balancing possibilities schemes and thus better utilizing short-term trading opportunities. The platform provides possibilities to balance scheduling errors prior and after physical delivery. In particular the IntradayS market allows the compensation of foreseeable and already occurred load forecast errors and the balancing of deviations from the balance responsible parties' (BRP) schedules which ultimately leads to a reduction of balancing energy demand by the BRP. Risks and costs associated with the use of balancing energy are reduced. Electricity offers can be published in two segments, called M- and M+. One market enables BRPs to balance their schedule before physical delivery and the other market aims at balancing the schedule after physical delivery (Power2Energy 2014b). The M- market provides the BRP with the possibility to exchange schedule deviations with users that have a schedule deviation in the opposite direction, also called \"ex post balancing\" or \"day-after trading\". The last 6 days and the current day (D-6 to D) can be traded. The product time frame (product length) is a quarter of an hour. The trading is possible for all partners which are governed by MaBiS (Power2Energy 2014b). The M+ market facilitates the exchange of opposite deviations prior to physical delivery. The current day, from the current hour onwards and the six following days (D to D + 6) can be traded. The product time frame (product length) is a quarter of an hour. The product time frame (product length) is an hour (Power2Energy 2014b). When the trade is performed the traders (balance responsible parties) have engaged in a direct contractual relationship, clearing as in the exchanges does not take place. The traders (as the balance responsible parties) change their schedules and submit updated schedules to the system operator (e.g. TSO). Non-delivery or other non-compliance with the contracts is dealt with in-between the involved traders. No penalties are implemented as such, however schedule violations will be penalized with the payment of the balancing settlement price (as described in chapter 2.1). Non-delivery will be identified through the balancing settlement scheme. It can be assumed that losses due to non-delivery will be financially reimbursed. (Power2Energy 2014b) Bidding on the market works similarly to the exchange markets. Users communicate their supply and demand quantities and the corresponding prices either on the market platform or via the telephone directly with other users. For settlements in the M- product the EPEX SPOT market price is set as the value for the exchanged energy. Telephone contacts allow for very short-term trading i.e. in the case of an unplanned power plant outage. The transactions are always closed and settled by the users themselves and as OTC transaction and not by the platform. The IntradayS market supports these OTC trades and execution of transactions by storing, displaying, calculating and providing information and data. The admission process consists of the filling out of the application for utilization and signing of the terms and conditions of use. These documents will have to be sent to the market operator. The use of the IntradayS market requires the payment of an initial admission fee of 3,000 EUR and a monthly usage fee of 100 EUR (Power2Energy 2014b). 3.3.1.2 Energie-handelsplatz.de www.energy-handelsplatz.de is an auction and bidding platform for industrial and commercial energy consumers. It provides a matching platform for industrial customers and energy suppliers. Around 200 national as well as regionally suppliers are listed with Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 48 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets standard contracts. Buyers of electricity can buy electricity with a fixed price for the delivery period. As an energy supplier matching customers can be found through standardized auctions on predefined dates. Information on the auction details are published in advance (energie-handelsplatz.de 2014a). Companies that do not buy electricity at fixed prices can take advantage of their broker 1 to create custom contracts for the platform. Energy suppliers then can decide to trade individually with those companies through their brokers. The bidding is done here in the traditional way by e-mail, fax or letter (energie-handelsplatz.de 2014a). Each broker charges fees for the use of energy-handelsplatz.de which are dependent on amount of delivery of each individual auction. The amount is summed across multiple delivery points and delivery years. The fee paid to www.energie- handelsplatz.de for each kilowatt-hour is 0.01 EURct/kWh (0.1 EUR/MWh). The minimum fee however is 50 EUREUR and the maximum fee is 2500 EUREUR. The fees are due with the publication of the tender. The activity of the respective broker is not paid by these fees and depends on the individual agreement between the broker and the customer (energie-handelsplatz.de 2014b). 3.4 Clearing at the European Commodity Clearing ECC Trading on the exchange market requires the usage of a clearing house. It is not mandatory to use the services of a clearing house when the electricity is traded OTC nonetheless the service can be used to clear trades. This is especially useful when the trading has taken place between brokers instead of the companies themselves. A clearing house is an institution in the electricity markets which provides settlement services and securities for transactions. The underlying transactions can either be executed on the EPEX SPOT exchange, the EEX exchange or off-exchange OTC. The clearing house acts as an intermediary between two clearing participants and secures the transaction towards failure to honour trade settlement obligations and thus eliminating settlement risks. Clearing houses have to be properly managed and well capitalized to be able to withstand events such as a default of large clearing firms. The assumption of the trade risk by the clearing house means that the clearing members are required to pay a premium called margin (also called \"margin deposits“ or “collateral deposits”). Details on the margin and a margin calculator can be found on (ECC 2014e, 2014f). The clearing house for the EPEX SPOT and EEX is the European Commodity Clearing ECC (ECC 2014a). Applicants can be admitted by ECC as NCM. This ensures secure settlement, delivery and hedging of the transactions through the clearing house. The following requirements are necessary for admission by ECC (ECC 2014h): • “Completion of a Know-Your-Customer Questionnaire (KYC) if requested by ECC and passing of the ECC KYC assessment or other applicable access policies of ECC 1 Brokers facilitate the trading for companies who do not wish to trade electricity themselves. This may have various reasons such as non-relevance for the core business or lacking volumes for the trades in combination with high transaction costs. Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 49 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets • Conclusion of a corresponding NCM Agreement with the co-operating Clearing Member and ECC • The clearing license of the Clearing Member co-operating with said Non- Clearing Member has to comprise the product concerned, e.g. futures or options • In case of physical delivery, the conclusion of a balance group agreement with the respective TSO is required” A company applying as an NCM at ECC has to pass the KYC process at ECC. He needs to provide a signed and completed KYC questionnaire if requested by ECC. Additionally the following documents are required (ECC 2014g): • Company House Act (Proof of Registration, Ger.: Handelsregister) • License ( Only for regulated bank or financial service provider) • Organizational Chart (Company Structure) • Audited Annual Report or Business Plan of the company, the main shareholder and Ultimate Parent Based on the information given in the KYC questionnaire, the accompanying documents and other information (e.g. Internet, Reuters) ECC calculates a score. This score is calculated on an ECC-internal, non-published algorithm and is subject to continuous changes. Based on this score the applicant is assigned to a risk category and is either admitted by ECC or rejected. The decision will not be justified by ECC. Admitted member will be subject re-assessment by ECC, e.g. in the change of ownership. Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 50 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets Preconditions Details Step 1 Engaging communication with exchange operator and passing on application documents Support by Exchange operator for details Step 2 Questionnaire Fill in the “Know Your Customer” questionnaire. Based on this ECC will score your company. If the scoring is positive the admission process continues Step 3 Submit documents to ECC Send documents for the admission to ECC. This includes the KYC questionnaire and other documents 1 Step 5 Scoring Evaluations of KYC questionnaire and other documents and subsequent scoring by ECC. NCM members are categorized based on a risk assessment. Step 6 Approval Admittance or refusal by ECC Step 7 Final step Final steps of the admission process are initiated Steps for the approval process at the EPEX SPOT (EPEX SPOT 2014a) As mentioned above companies trading at EPEX SPOT have to be admitted as Non- Clearing-Members and/or Clearing-Members by ECC. Only clearing members (CM) can trade on the ECC associated markets individually (see chapter 3.1.1). Non-clearing members (NCM) do not own a clearing license and only can take part in the clearing process as a client of a clearing member. A CM guarantees for all trades on the exchange either from itself or it’s contracted NCMs. The CM holds a clearing licence. The rights and duties of this licence are regulated by contracts with ECC, the ECC Clearing Conditions, Technical Regulations and ECC’s Price List. CM can acquire two different types of clearing memberships (ECC 2014b, 2014i, 2014c): • “Direct Clearing Member (DCM): authorised to clear transactions on its own account, customer transactions as well as transactions by affiliated 2 Non- Clearing Members. • General Clearing Member (GCM): authorised to clear transactions on its own account, customer transactions or transactions by Non-Clearing Members.” 1 Additional documents to be delivered will be mentioned in the KYC 2 Contractual basis between the CM and the NMC Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 51 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets To become a clearing member one has to fulfil minimum prerequisites (ECC 2014c): • The company has to be based in a member state of the European Union or Switzerland. • The company has to hold a bank license of the local fiscal authority. • Liable equity funds of 30 Million EUR for GCMs and EUR 7.5 Million EUR for DCMs need to be proven. • TARGET2 account (own account or 3rd party account) needed 1. • Pledge-securities Account at Clearstream Banking Frankfurt for the deposit of collaterals. • Additionally for multi-currency settlement a settlement account through which USD or GBP funds can be processed at Clearstream Banking AG Luxemburg (CBL 6 Series Account). • Technical access to ECC settlement system (EUREX/SMSS) required. • Proof of the operation of an adequate technical access (back-office access) and proof of qualified personnel required • Contribution to the clearing fund (EUR 3.0 m for GCM / EUR 0.5 m for DCMs) required. EEC also offers clearing services to non-exchange traded derivatives. The OTC-trades can be registered at the clearing house. The process is possible for standardized OTC derivative contracts. This enables the market participants to avoid the effects of financial shocks since the ECC assumes the counterparties risks for the trade. It mitigates the credit and default risks associated with over-the-counter trading. Based on the grade of standardization of the OTC-derivatives the clearing house uses a different set of rules for the clearing. Clearing obligation and standardization are influencing the risk of OTC-derivatives and hence the collateral requirements for the trader. OTC derivatives with a high degree of standardization are leading to risk characteristics similar to exchange traded derivatives and are ultimately treated as exchange traded derivatives (ECC 2013). The clearing conditions stated in the following graph can be found in (ECC 2014d). Risk categories for cleared OTC-derivatives (for * see 2) (ECC 2013) 1 Second generation of the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System. System for transferences between different banks 2 Echange traded refers to Art. 1 No. 14 MiFiD and includes trading on regulated markets in third countries Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 52 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets OTC derivatives generally are subject to the Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, also called EMIR (European Parliament and the Council 7/27/2012). As stated by the regulation, energy related OTC contracts beyond the threshold 3 Billion EUR in gross notional value are subject to clearing obligations, which are regulated in Regulation (EU) No149/2013 (European Commission 2013). This applies for any sort of contracts like forwards and OTC Options. For the calculation of the threshold all contracts are cumulated for each financial period. It is unclear whether position netting is allowed (BDEW 2013). This means that is uncertain whether buys and sells are netted or added. Contracts within the same group between different companies are included in the sum as well. It is highly recommended that external advice is consulted. Already cleared contracts, e.g. futures on the EEX, are not included in the calculation of the threshold. The calculation of the threshold will be as the following example: Gross notional value = Traded Volume * Contract Price For a single forward contract with the fictional price of 30 EUR/MWh it is necessary to acquire 100 TWh to reach the threshold for the gross notional value of 3 Billion EUR, accounting for 1/6 of Germany annual electricity consumption. All other responsibilities than the clearing obligations remain unaffected, as described in chapter 2.3. All contracts that are registered at EEX and cleared via ECC will not be taken into account for the calculation of the 3 Billion EUR EMIR threshold. Voluntary clearing avoids mandatory clearing. 3.5 Cross-border capacity allocation at CASC.EU In addition to trade on the spot market with market coupling applied, one can trade cross-border transmission capacities. These cross-border transmission capacities are allocated with different time horizons. The transmission capacity can be acquired specifically to transmit power from one country to another without having to rely on power exchanges. It enables traders to access local markets at the given local price at the exchange. One can sell, for example, electricity on the French market with a unit which is connected to the German grid. This electricity will be sold on the French market, even in the case of congestion in the spot market. The cross-border transmission capacity can be acquired at CASC.EU, which is a subsidiary of the involved TSOs on a European level. For Germany the TSOs TenneT, Amprion and TransnetBW are shareholders of CASC.EU. The capacities can be acquired for the time span of an entire year of for a whole month and if available, as well on a daily basis (CASC.EU 2014a). The company that acquired the transmission capacity is the holder of the capacity. It has the right to nominate the transmission capacity on a day-to-day base. This means it can announce the usage of the capacity between 0 and full capacity. If the capacity holder does not wish to use the capacity entirely or not at all it can be sold in different ways. A first option is the return to CASC.EU for a whole month. The capacity holder then is reimbursed with the price for the capacity from the monthly contract. Second option is the transfer of capacity to a different company. Prices and conditions are agreed upon via OTC contracts. Third option is keeping the capacity and making it available for market coupling. The reimbursement is calculated as the price difference between the two markets after market coupling times the unused capacity. (Pergel 9/25/2014) Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 53 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets Compensation = unused capacity * price spread Interconnectors without market coupling capacities are tendered through CASC.EU also for the day-ahead and intraday case. CASC.EU describes itself at the central auction office for cross-border transmission capacity for Central Western Europe, the borders of Italy, Switzerland, Norway and Denmark. The trading on the platform includes secondary markets. The initial auction session is a trade between the respective TSOs and the customers. On the secondary market transmission capacities are traded between different customers. This means that already acquired capacity can be sold to other market participants. (CASC.EU 2014a). The following two graphs show the results from the capacity allocation for the transmission from Germany to France (not vice-versa) for the year 2014 and for September 2014. The rights to transmit a single MWh of electricity from Germany to France at any time in the year 2014 cost 7.59 EUR/MWh. The same right for the month September 2014 cost 2.68 EUR/MWh. This price has to be paid upfront whether the capacity is nominated or not. Resale options are mentioned above. Exemplary results from the 2014 annual cross-border capacity allocation tender for the transmission of electricity between Germany and France (CASC.EU 2014c) Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 54 | 80 Wholesale Power Markets Exemplary results from the September 2014 cross-border capacity allocation tender for the transmission of electricity between Germany and France (CASC.EU 2014b) Access to CASC.EU can be gained through the website. Each category of cross-border transmission capacities has to be applied for separately. The different regions for available transmission capacities are Central Western Europe (CWE consisting of Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) CWE (additionally consisting of Spain and Portugal), Swiss borders, Danish borders (internal/external) and the France-Spain border. Intraday auctions have between any of these countries has to be applied separately.The admission process in general includes the filling of forms for the different interconnectors. After admission by CASC.EU access to the trading system is granted and traders can be trained for the participation. All admission criteria are accessible at (CASC.EU 2014d). Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 55 | 80 Ancillary Services 4 Ancillary Services System operators are responsible for the stable grid operation with the aid of ancillary services. These ancillary services are: • Compensation of grid losses • Island operation and black start capability • Reactive power for voltage control • Control reserve for frequency control The costs of purchasing ancillary services are monitored by the Federal Network Agency who publishes the aggregated costs annually. System operators have to forecast their grid losses and procure energy to compensate for such losses. For the long-term component (predictable for the long term) Transmission System Operators have to organise a tendering procedure. Energy for the short-term component (deviations from the long-term component) has to be procured via a third party which has to be appointed by a tendering procedure. Alternatively the energy can be procured via an organised market place in both cases (Bundesnetzagentur 2008). In 2012 the German TSOs spent 354.01 Mio. EUR on energy compensating for grid losses (Bundesnetzagentur 2014c). In the case of a blackout the TSO has to re-establish the electricity grid. Therefore he uses the island operation capability and black start capability of suitable units. The TSO compensates the owners of such units for the provision of the technical facilities. Details are agreed upon bilaterally (Verband der Netzbetreiber e.V. beim VDEW). The German TSOs spent 5.25 Mio. EUR in 2012 for the provision of black start capability (Bundesnetzagentur 2014c). For the operation of most electrical devices the voltage has to be kept in specific limits. However the voltage can e.g. drop along a power line due to electrical resistances or reactive currents. Therefore grid operators maintain the voltage with the help of voltage control. The selection of generation units for voltage control is made due to requirements of the grid operation as it is important where voltage control takes place. Details are agreed in bilateral contracts (Verband der Netzbetreiber e.V. beim VDEW). In 2012 the German TSOs spent 68.35 Mio. EUR for the procurement of reactive power (Bundesnetzagentur 2014c). In electricity systems generation and consumption have always to be in balance to guarantee a safe grid operation at a constant frequency. For this reason unforeseen deviations of generation or consumption units from their schedules have to be balanced out at short notice. This is done by generation or consumption units which increase or decrease their generation respectively their consumption depending on the frequency or on request of the TSO. These procured capacities are called control reserves. The German TSOs procure three different types of control reserves: Primary control reserve is used for the fast stabilisation of the grid frequency after a disturbance in the time frame of seconds. It is activated simultaneously by all contracted providers in the UCTE synchronous area, irrespective whether the imbalance was caused within the TSO’s control area or not. It is not activated by a central sent signal but individually depending on the measured grid frequency. The complete activation of the reserve has to be done within 30 seconds with a linear ramp. In the Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 56 | 80 Ancillary Services UCTE synchronous area 3000 MW of primary control reserves are procured. This capacity is split up between all TSOs according to their annual peak load. The German TSOs for example had to procure 568 MW in 2014. The German TSOs spent 82.27 Mio. EUR in 2012 for the procurement of primary control reserve (Bundesnetzagentur 2014c). Secondary control is used to balance the energy within each TSO’s control area, should bring the grid frequency back to its nominal value and replace primary control. It has to be completely activated within five minutes and the activation is immediately done by the TSO. For the procurement of secondary control reserve capacity 267.07 Mio. EUR were spent in 2012 (Bundesnetzagentur 2014c). Tertiary control partially complements secondary control and finally replaces it. Minute reserve’s or tertiary control reserve’s activation has to be completed within fifteen minutes. The activation is done electronically since 2012. In 2012 the German TSOs spent 67.42 Mio. EUR on the procurement of minute reserve capacity (Bundesnetzagentur 2014c). Additionally immediately and quickly interruptible loads are procured by the TSOs since the end of 2012. In this context interruptible loads are large consumption units which consume a large volume of electricity in a more or less continuously way and can reduce or interrupt their consumption on short notice for a certain time span. Usually control reserves are provided by large thermal and hydro power plants, pumped hydro storages and loads. Recently also smaller biomass power plants gained in importance. Usually the required reserves are procured in each TSO’s own control area. However, since 2010 the German TSOs cooperate within a Grid Control Cooperation (Netzreglerverbund). This means that their four control areas are operated as one control area. The functionality of this Grid Control Cooperation is assured by four modules (www.regelleistung.net): 1. Prevent counteracting control reserve activation 2. Common dimensioning of control reserve 3. Common procurement of secondary control reserve 4. Cost-optimised activation of control reserve As a consequence of the Grid Control Cooperation there are no restrictions for the procurement and activation of control reserves in Germany. The Grid Control Cooperation should be extended to neighbouring countries. Until now Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Belgium and Austria have joined the first module (www.regelleistung.net). Additionally Switzerland and the Netherlands procure a part of their required primary control reserves (25 MW respectively 35 MW) via a common auction with the German TSOs. This auction is open for all prequalified providers of primary control reserve from these three countries (www.regelleistung.net 2014). The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) aims at an integrated electricity balancing market for whole Europe to improve the efficiency of frequency control. To eliminate the existing barriers (different balancing products, different pricing, etc.) ACER adopted its Framework Guidelines on Electricity Balancing in 2012. Core element of the Framework Guidelines are models for cross-border exchanges of balancing energy that should result in one European platform for the procurement of control reserves. Additionally the harmonisation of key elements such as balancing products, balancing energy prices, etc. is pushed to pave the way to a fully integrated Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 57 | 80 Ancillary Services electricity balancing market (ACER 2014). Based on these Framework Guidelines ENTSO-E has improved the Network Code on Electricity Balancing (ENTSO-E 2014). The procurement of control reserves is done via tenders on the common internet platform of the four German TSOs www.regelleistung.net. To offer control reserve potential providers have to complete a prequalification procedure which is described in the following chapter and sign a framework contract. A list of all prequalified providers for each type of control reserve can also be found on this platform 1. Primary control reserve Secondary control reserve Tertiary control reserve Purpose Stabilise grid frequency after a disturbance Balance control areas, bring grid frequency back to nominal value, replace primary control Complement and replace secondary control Time until complete activation 30 sec 5 min 15 min Reaction time immediately 5 min, 30 sec until first change of power for pooled reserve providers 2 15 min Activation Local, static relation to the frequency Immediately by the TSO via set points Automatically by Merit Order List Server (MOLS) Number of prequalified providers (July 2014) 20 27 38 Requirements of the different types of control reserves 4.1 Prequalification During the prequalification process potential providers of control reserve have to demonstrate their technical competence, their ability to perform accordingly to the requested operational requirements and their healthy financial standing. For this 1 https://www.regelleistung.net/ip/action/static/provider 2 Pools providing secondary control reserve have to show a first reaction to the secondary control activation signal of the TSO within 30 seconds, at the latest. Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 58 | 80 Ancillary Services process normally a minimum of two months is needed for the prequalification process since all required documents have been submitted. The TransmissionCode 2007 issued by the German TSOs defines all requirements for the prequalification 1. Chapter 5 contains the general requirements that are detailed in Annexe D: • Technical requirements to each technical unit • Technical requirement to control reserve pools • Requirements to the control system • Organisational requirements In the following the most important requirements will be explained. Regarding the technical requirements to each technical unit the potential provider of control reserve has to demonstrate the technical ability of each unit to perform like required. Inter alia the technical unit has to follow a model protocol as for example shown in the figure below for positive primary control reserve 2. Model protocol for the prequalification of a technical unit for positive primary control (regelleistung.net 2014) Thermal units providing secondary control reserve always have to be synchronous to the grid whereas hydraulic units also can be in standstill if they are able to reach the amount of prequalified control reserve within five minutes. All three types of control reserve can be provided not only by a single unit but also by pools of several units. Pooling for all three types of control reserves is allowed within one control area. Pools of units that are located in different control areas are only allowed for secondary control and minute reserve to reach the minimum product size. Furthermore the provider has to provide additional units for the replacement of failed units as he has to guarantee the availability of the complete offered control reserve 1 All important documents regarding the prequalification process can be found regelleistung.net: https://www.regelleistung.net/ip/action/static/prequal?prequal=&language=en 2 Model protocols for secondary control reserve and minute reserve look similar but differ from the shown model protocol with regard to required ramps etc. Fraunhofer IWES German Power Market 59 | 80 Ancillary Services over the whole product length. If the provider is not able to fulfil this requirement the TSO is allowed to delete the payments for not provided capacity respectively energy. Additionally the provider has to pay additional costs of appropriate substitution. In the case of repeated breaches of contract within one year the TSO can charge the provider a contractual penalty and in the worst case the prequalification can be withdrawn (www.regelleistung.net 2011, 2012, 2013). Providers of primary control reserve and minute reserve only have to inform the TSO online about each unit’s current feed-in or draw-off and some additional information. Providers of secondary control reserve, however, have to meet much more demanding requirements, e.g. a redundant design of all communication channels, a control cycle of maximum four seconds, etc. These requirements are detailed in (50hertz, Amprion, TenneT, TransnetBW) The most important organisational requirement is the constant availability of a contact person for the TSO during the provision of control reserves. 4.2 Frequency control reserve market All tenders and their anonymised results are published on www.regelleistung.net. The tendered amount of primary control reserve is determined by the ENTSO-E and changes every year whereas the amounts of secondary and tertiary control are calculated by the German TSOs every quarter of the year. The control reserve market is organised as a pay-as-bid market. 4.2.1 Product specifications For primary control reserves the product length is one week (Monday to Sunday). The offering time is normally 10:00 on the Tuesday before. The tenders for primary control reserves are ‘symmetrical’, that means that there are no separate tenders for positive or negative reserve. The minimum lot size is +/- 1 MW with increments of 1 MW. There is only a capacity price and no energy price. The product length for secondary control reserve is also one week like for primary control reserve. But the products are divided in peak (Monday to Friday from 8:00 till 20:00) and off-peak (Monday to Friday from 0:00 till 8:00 and from 20:00 till 24:00 and on Saturday and Sunday as well as on national holidays) and there are separate tenders for positive and negative secondary control reserve. The offering time is usually 10:00 on the Wednesday before the delivery week. The minimum lot size is 5 MW with increments of 1 MW. Offers are accepted from the merit order list which is based on the offered capacity price. The call for the delivery of secondary control reserves follows the order of the offered energy prices from low to high prices. The energy price is paid for actually delivered energy on top of the capacity price. For minute reserve a product length of 4 hours applies (6 time slices per day). The offering time is always at 10:00 for the next day and for the following weekend and/or holidays. Apart from that the same conditions as for secondary control apply. Providers of all three types of control reserve have to be able to deliver balancing power equal to the offered capacity over the whole product length.
