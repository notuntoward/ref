Introduction Batteries are prevalent energy providers for modern systems, such as smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles (EV). Batteries hold the relative high energy density in a conﬁned space. For example, the energy density of lead-acid batteries is around 10∼40Wh/kg [1]. Energy densities of NiCd and lithium-ion batteries are around 50∼75Wh/kg and 100∼200Wh/kg, respectively [1]. Regarding some other types of electrical energy storage systems, supercapacitors hold the energy density around 2.5∼15Wh/kg [2]. The reliability and safety of batteries are thus quite crucial for their users [3, 4]. Reference [3] provided an overview of PHM for lithium-ion batteries, which advocated the importance of battery reliability via accurate estimation of state of health (SOH) and state of charge (SOC). In [4], the authors reviewed the thermal runaway mechanisms of lithium-ion batteries, which emphasized the signiﬁcance of battery safety. For example, battery safety is a key focus in the design of EV [5]. Battery safety attracts increasing attention from battery consumers and producers. Battery PHM can be helpful for ensuring battery safety. Failures of batteries can bring loss of power, downtime, and even severe accidents. For example, the short circuit has the risk of leading to temperature increase, and subsequent ﬁre and explosion. In recent years, several accidents have brought signif- icant losses to users, distributors, and manufactures. For examples, battery faults of smartphones have cost Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. billions of dollars and brought huge of reputation losses in 2016. These faults are generated by design ﬂaws (thin separators and high energy density in batteries) and manufacturing defects [6]. A cargo ﬂight, a Boeing 747-400F operated by United Parcel Service (UPS), crashed because of the ﬁre generated by Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries in 2010 [7]. In addition, failures of batteries can lead to recall activities (therefore huge of losses). Recently, due to ﬁre and burn hazards, about 52,600 Li-ion batteries of notebook computers and mobile workstations are recalled in January 2018 [8], around 260,000 Li-ion portable power banks are recalled in March 2018 [9]. Therefore stakeholders expect eﬀective techniques to ensure availability and reliability of batteries. Owing to complicated electrochemical characteristics and complex working con- ditions, lithium-ion batteries reveal highly dynamic and nonlinear features [10]. To ensure the required operational performance of lithium-ion batteries, it is necessary to accurately estimate the battery status. Furthermore, to avoid unexpected incidents and subsequent losses, it is helpful to carry out performance prediction of batteries. To meet the accuracy and applicability requirement of battery consumers, prognostics and health management methods are signiﬁcantly important. Battery PHM refers to activities to apply PHM approaches in the ﬁeld of batteries, which includes the prognostics (i.e., health prediction) and health management (e.g., replacement) of batteries. By adopting battery PHM, it enables engineers to obtain and predict the health state of batteries and proactively take measures to maintain the required availability of batteries. Accurate estimation of SOC, SOH, and RUL of batteries is of critical importance for obtaining remaining charge, capacity, and life of batteries. Therefore, it can enable users to timely plan maintenance strategies and conduct disposal and replacement [3]. 3 Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) technique has been widely adopted in diﬀerent ﬁelds to improve and maintain the availability of engineered systems [11, 12, 13]. Reference [11] provided a comprehensive investigation of PHM applied in elec- tronics area. In [12], the researchers discussed in detail the prognostics approaches applied in engineering systems. Comprehensive aspects of prognostics methods are also investigated in [13]. Prognostics aims at predicting the future status of a system, whereas the process of health management uses the information generated as advisory to institute actions to return the system to a healthy state [14]. With growing re- quirements of high reliability of modern engineered systems, PHM receives increasing attention from academia and industry communities. A signiﬁcant number of studies on PHM of batteries have been published. We retrieved the journal publications on PHM from the Web of Science database in the past ten years (2009-2018), as shown in Figure 1. We found that research works on PHM have increased steadily from 2010 to 2014 and more rapidly from 2014 to 2018.

The objectives of investigating battery PHM is to improve the control, manage- ment, and maintenance of batteries and to enable the safe and reliable operation of battery systems [3]. According to our survey, several researchers have conducted liter- ature review on battery PHM. Zhang and Lee [15] reviewed the approaches to predict the capacity, current, voltage, state of charge (SOC), and remaining useful life (RUL) of Li-ion batteries. The review was comprehensive at that time in 2011. However, due to the rapid growth of the research on battery PHM in the past few years (see e.g., the tendency in Figure 1), it is necessary to conduct literature investigation on the articles published in recent years. Liao and K¨ottig [16] conducted literature review on generic prognostics approaches. To apply advantages of involved prognostics approaches, the authors advocated to use hybrid prognostics approaches to predict RUL of engineered systems, not limited to batteries. Rezvanizaniani et al. [17] reviewed prognostics ap- proaches for EV batteries. The authors considered battery prognostics with focusing on ensuring the EV safety and mobility. Berecibar et al. [18] conducted a review on state of health (SOH) estimation approaches of Li-ion batteries. Their study paid attention to SOH estimation rather than prediction. Shrivastava et al. [10] surveyed particularly the Kalman ﬁlter family algorithms for SOC estimation of lithium-ion 4 batteries. Lipu et al. [19] conducted a general review on SOH and RUL estimation of lithium-ion batteries in EVs. Li et al. [20] reviewed mainly the data-driven health estimation and health prognostics of lithium-ion batteries. According to the discus- sions above, we ﬁnd that a more comprehensive and up-to-date review on the battery PHM is required. We intend to conduct the literature review by considering both the prognostics and the health management aspects. Exterior and inner environment (inﬂuenced by operation and storage of batteries) can inﬂuence the PHM objectives of batteries. For example, wastewater generated by batteries can heavily harm the environment. Therefore the wastewater treatment is an indispensable step in the lifecycle of batteries [21]. Techniques for wastewater treatment normally include the chemical-physical treatment processes and biological ones [22]. Among them, Membrane bioreactors (MBR) is an alternative biological technique for battery wastewater treatment. MBR is composed of a typical activated sludge process (ASP) and membrane separation to maintain biomass [23, 24]. In this paper, we focus on PHM methods of lithium-ion batteries, besides several publications discussed other types of batteries (e.g., lead-acid batteries). Moreover, this manuscript investigated more on PHM methods, rather than empirical PHM from the engineering viewpoint. Although battery chemistry is the basis of the battery exterior performance, we focus on battery PHM from the perspective of battery health performance, rather than the battery chemistry. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces PHM in general. Section 3 reviews the classiﬁcation of batteries. Section 4 illustrates the application of PHM for batteries. Based on literature review, Section 5 outlines the perspectives for future research in battery PHM. Eventually, Section 6 concludes the article. 2. Prognostics and Health Management PHM was ﬁrst coined in 1990s [25, 26, 27, 28], along with the launch of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) project of the US army. The initial application of PHM is thus in the military aviation domain. Given the accelerated development of the sensor technology (see e.g., [29]) and prediction algorithms, practitioners have more opportunity to monitor and predict the system status. System stakeholders can thus proactively take measures to avoid severe accidents. Therefore PHM is currently popular in a growing number of domains. PHM aims to provide actionable information to aid timely decisions [30]. Several PHM-related international standards have already been published. Among them, IEEE Std 1856: 2017 provides guidance for carrying out PHM for electronic sys- tems [14]. It can be extended to other systems, such as the mechanical and energy systems. 5 Table 1: Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) cycle (adapted from [14]). Stages Steps Sense (1) Sensors Acquire (2) Data acquisition (3) Data manipulation Analyze (4) State detection (5) Health assessment (6) Prognostic assessment Advise (7) Advisory generation Act (8) Health management The life cycle of PHM can be illustrated in Table 1. This PHM cycle is composed of eight steps [14]: • (1) Sensors: This function involves physical sensors and any soft system perfor- mance variables available within the system. • (2) Data acquisition: This function acquires and records the sensor data and health state information from the internal monitors, data bus or recorder of the system. • (3) Data manipulation: This function processes the data from step (2). • (4) State detection: This function assesses the state conditions with the compar- ison of normal operating proﬁles and generates normal or abnormal condition indicators. • (5) Health assessment: This function generates information to obtain the SOH of the system. • (6) Prognostic assessment: This function gives upcoming SOH, remaining per- formance life, or RUL (usage) indicators. • (7) Advisory generation: This function gives applicable action strategies to operational and repair crews or exterior systems. • (8) Health management: This function uses the information generated in advi- sory generation to institute actions to return the system to a healthy state. Prognostics is the key step of PHM. It is the prediction procedure of the RUL of the object system by modeling the fault propagation by considering the present level of degradation, the load proﬁle, and the future operational and environmental scenarios to estimate the time at which the target system will no more perform its predetermined function [14]. A number of prognostics approaches have been proposed. They can be generally classiﬁed into three groups: data-driven, physics-based, and hybrid approaches. Physics-based approaches use explicit mathematical equations to incorpo- rate physical knowledge about the degradation/failure behaviors of a particular sys- tem [31]. Physics-based approaches assume that system behaviors can be character- ized analytically and precisely [30, 32]. To develop physics-based models, detailed domain knowledge of underlying the degradation processes leading to failure is there- fore required [31]. It can be accurate when the degradation physics knowledge is 6 suﬃcient and relevant. In terms of a battery, its internal electrochemical process is hardly to be observed [17]. Therefore the degradation process of batteries cannot be described directly in a precise way. Moreover, physics-based models developed in laboratories need to be adapted to the real operating environment, which can be constantly changing and rather diﬀerent from the laboratory conditions. Data-driven approaches extract useful features from collected data to charac- terize the current state and thus to model the degradation trend [33]. By using data- driven approaches, it is un-necessary to model various degradation/failure physics in a precise way, instead, only the collected data is used to predict future RUL. The major limitation of data-driven approaches is the prerequisite of suﬃcient training data that is indeed relevant to the failure/degradation under study. Hybrid approaches combine the advantages of both physics-based and data- driven approaches [31]. If a hybrid approach obtains the prior knowledge of physics- based model in the ﬁrst step, and attains unmeasured process parameters by data- driven approaches in the second step, we call such an approach as series approach [30]. That is, the physics-based model can be updated with new data by using data-driven approaches. If we are able to learn from physics-based and data-driven approaches at the same time, we name such hybrid approaches as parallel ones [30]. That is, data-driven approaches serve as supplement to those cannot be described directly by physics-based models. Characteristics of prognostics approaches are summarized in Table 2. Data-driven approaches require less accurate mathematical modeling of systems than physics- based approaches. However, data-driven approaches require more data than physics- based ones. An et al. [33] applied a selection tree to determine the appropriate prog- nostics approach for a speciﬁc question. The nodes (e.g. the existence of information, the complexity of degradation behavior, the level of noise) of the tree decide the se- lection process. The authors compared Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), Particle ﬁlter (PF) and Bayesian method with a mission of crack growth prediction. Physics-based and data-driven approaches are also signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by en- vironment and conditions, such as the availability of suﬃcient data and physical mechanisms. Regarding physics-based approaches, when physics behaviors of target components are explicitly available, they are more robust to the environment. In terms of data-driven methods, when suﬃcient useful data is available, data-driven methods are usually applicable. Due to the combination of the beneﬁts of physics- based and data-driven approaches, hybrid approaches are regarded as more applicable when dealing with new environment. It is necessary to consider dynamic operational and environmental loading con- ditions, which can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the accuracy and uncertainty of PHM ap- proaches [11]. Furthermore, it is diﬃcult to guarantee the accuracy of feature ex- traction procedure for monitoring dataset in real situations [11]. In engineering sce- narios, along with various operational and environmental conditions, the monitored data would be much more irregular than laboratory environment [11, 34]. Together with inﬂuencing factors like the current degradation degree and load proﬁle, future environmental and operational conditions (such as thermal, mechanical, chemical, 7 and electrical ones) can aﬀect prognostics results [11]. Assuming that a training dataset is obtained with the constant discharge current of a battery, if the discharge current varies in the test (prognostics) period, the prediction error can be generated and prognostics model needs to be updated accordingly. For instance, the charge and discharge cycles of batteries can lead to growth of their surface temperatures. Therefore, to meet the high accuracy requirement of prognostics models, such phe- nomenon needs to be taken into account. In brief, we need to consider the uncertainty of dynamic environmental loads in prognostics models. Table 2: Characteristics of prognostics approaches. Approaches Advantages Disadvantages Physics-based Accurate to describe degrada- tion/failure behaviors of com- ponents, subsystems, and sys- tems; provide knowledge and understanding about the degra- dation/failure; do not require plenty of data. Hard to observe the degrada- tion process directly; physics- based models developed in lab- oratories need to be adapted to simulate the real environment in practice. Data-driven Un-necessary to model various degradation/failure physics in a precise way; require little do- main knowledge. Reliance on relevant and qual- ity data; low adaptation to new conditions. Hybrid Combine advantages of physics-based and data-driven approaches. Complexity of the selection, combination and parameter tuning of various methods. In particular, given the recent rapid development of sensor technology and Inter- net of Things (IoT), massive real-time data recording and transmitting devices can be utilized for PHM research and applications [35]. Due to its powerful feature learn- ing capability, deep learning has attracted interests from the PHM community [36]. Deutsch and He [35] integrated the deep belief network and feedforward neural net- work to predict RUL of rotating components. The approach can improve the situation that traditional data-driven approaches are built with shallow learning architectures and explicit model equations. Li et al. [37] conducted the RUL prediction by using a deep convolutional neural network. By applying the presented method, it is not required to know in advance the knowledge of signal processing and prognostics. 3. Batteries Batteries can be classiﬁed into primary and secondary batteries, as shown in Figure 2, according to whether their chemical reactions are reversible or not. Sec- ondary batteries can be further categorized into Lead-acid, Lithium-ion (Li-ion), Nickel-cadmium (NiCd), Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, Nickel-zinc (NiZn), etc. Among them, Li-ion and Lead-acid batteries have attracted more interests from academia and industry. 8 2019.9.1 Primary batteries Alkaline batteries Lithium-metal batteries Leclanchébatteries Zinc-air batteries Zinc-carbon batteries … Secondary batteries Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries Lead-acid batteries Nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries Nickel-zinc (NiZn) batteries … Figure 2: Battery categories. Li-ion batteries are crucial components of the portable, entertainment, computing and telecommunication equipment [1, 38]. In charging and discharging processes, lithium ions are shuttled between the two electrodes [39]. Li-ion batteries have several attractive superiorities, such as the high energy density, long cycle life, and no-memory eﬀect [40, 41]. They have played a leading role in the energy storage industry and have dominated the consumer market of portable electronics devices [42]. Lead-acid batteries hold the largest market share for rechargeable batteries both in terms of sales value and MWh production [43]. They can serve as industrial batteries for standby, automotive batteries, and motive power [43]. State detection is one necessary step in PHM. For one battery, its status can be evaluated via parameters of SOC, SOH and state of function (SOF) [40, 41, 44]. • SOC corresponds to the stored charge that is available for working, relative to which is available after the battery has been fully charged. SOC describes the battery status, with the comparison of a totally charged one. SOC can be deﬁned as [13]: SOC = 1 − qmax − qb Cmax (1) where qb is the current charge of the battery, qmax is the maximum possible charge of the battery, and Cmax is the maximum possible capacity of the battery. • SOH represents the capability of a cell to store the electric energy, in relation to its initial or nominal capabilities. SOH can be regarded as a time-dependent variable with the following expression [13]: SOH = Cp Ci (2) 9 where Cp is the nominal capacity at the present time, Ci is the nominal capacity at the initial time. • SOF describes the ability of a battery to satisfy the power demands [41, 44]. SOF of battery is estimated by taking into account its SOC, SOH and operating conditions. SOF can be deﬁned as [41]: SOF = P − Pd Pm − Pd (3) where P represents the possible power that the battery can provide, Pd stands for the power demands, Pm denotes the maximum possible supplied power of the battery. Aforementioned parameters can be estimated by considering speciﬁc metrics of batteries, such as the voltage, capacity, current, inner resistance and working tem- perature. Several data sets for battery PHM study are publicly accessible [45, 46]. 4. Prognostics and Health Management of Batteries According to the classiﬁcation of PHM approaches in Table 2, we illustrate the PHM approaches for batteries in the similar way. 4.1. Prognostics of batteries The process of prognostics is normally composed of ﬁve steps [16]: measurement, feature extraction, state estimation, state prediction and RUL. In the ﬁrst step (mea- surement), we can obtain the original measurement data by using sensors. In the second step (feature extraction), to decrease the complexity of learning algorithms and increase the robustness of constructed models, we can ﬁnd a new set of k dimen- sions that are combinations of the original d dimensions [47]. Note that the second step is optional. In the third step (state estimation), we can estimate the state via the measurement models (indirectly evaluate the internal system state with the mea- surement data) and the deterioration models. In the forth step (state prediction), we can predict the state based on the results of the state estimation. Eventually, we can obtain the RUL of targeted components or systems. In a nutshell, state estimation is used to obtain the current health status. Subse- quently, state prediction (i.e., prognostics) intends to construct the prognostics model and make prediction of future health performance. State estimation and state pre- diction are indispensable in a prognostics process. Regarding the feature extraction, which is optional according to its application situation. In speciﬁc scenarios, it is not necessary to conduct feature extraction according to raw sensor measurement. In [16], feature extraction is declared to be optional for prognostics processes. An example is the health prognostics of lithium-ion batteries. Capacity, which can be monitored directly by a battery tester, is usually regarded as the health index of lithium-ion batteries. Under this assumption, we can carry out health prognostics of lithium-ion batteries without conducting feature extraction. 10 4.1.1. Physics-based approaches The internal resistance battery model (Rint model) consists of an ideal battery, with the open-circuit voltage (VOC), and a constant internal resistance (R) in the series relationship. The parameters in the Rint model change according to SOC, temperature (T ), and the direction of current ﬂow (charge or discharge) [48]. Since the voltage response of this model is sensitive to external load changes, this model is applicable assuming that the load conditions are steady [48]. To model the dynamic behaviors of battery voltages, the Thevenin circuit model (see e.g. [49, 50]) can be applied. It can be applied to estimate a battery’s voltage transient in response to the change of current load [17]. A RC network (Resistor- capacitor circuit) can ﬁlter signals by blocking certain frequencies and passing others. Therefore more RC circuits can represent more complicated behaviors of batteries. By adding more RC networks, we can enhance the accuracy of the Thevenin circuit model [17]. The Thevenin circuit is comprised of a battery, the internal resistance and a RC network in series. • A battery, whose open-circuit voltage is regarded as constant. • The internal resistance (R). • A RC network. The electrical circuit equivalent model can be applied for end of discharge (EOD) prediction under reasonable accuracy, but it cannot readily capture the aging ef- fects [13]. As an empirical battery model, its equivalent circuit can represent major dynamics of a battery. The model is composed of four parts (i.e., a capacitance, two RC networks and a resistor) in series. • A capacitance Cb, nonlinear, holds the charge of the battery and captures the open-circuit potential and concentration overpotential. • A RC network, Rsp and Csp in parallel, captures the main nonlinear voltage drop. • Another RC network, Rs and Cs in parallel. Rs captures the Ohmic drop. • A resistor, Rp, models the parasitic resistance that takes the self-discharge into account. The external load is added to both ends of Rp. Generic Equivalent Circuit Model R0 R1 C1 + - V I + - Ri Ci Rn Cn OCV Figure 3: A generic electrical circuit equivalent model. 11 A generic electrical circuit equivalent model is shown in Figure 3. The terminal voltage V of the battery is depicted as [51, 52]: V = OCV − I ( R0 + n∑ i=1 Ri ( 1 − exp(− t RiCi )) (4) where OCV represents the open circuit voltage of the battery, I denotes the current in the battery, R0 is the ohmic resistance of the battery, Ri and Ci are polarization resistance and capacitor in ith Resistance-Capacitance (RC) network, respectively. In a nutshellbrief, nRC network is a generic form. Particularly, 0RC is Rint model (i.e., n = 0) [48], 1RC is regarded as Thevenin model (i.e., n = 1) [49], and 2RC is treated as dual polarization (DP) model (i.e., n = 2) [53]. With the increasing number of RC networks, the parameter identiﬁcation and state estimation can become more diﬃcult [52]. In practice, Rint model, Thevenin model and DP model and their variants are widely applied [53, 54]. Regarding parameter identiﬁcation of equivalent circuit models, genetic algorithm (GA) can be considered applied to obtained the parameters of equivalent circuit models [52]. Besides the above electric circuit models, the other physics-based prognostics ap- proaches have also been applied. PF has been broadly applied in prognostics of engineering systems, including batteries [55, 56, 57]. The PF process is based on the state transition function f and the measurement function h [58, 59, 60]: xk = f (xk−1, θk, vk) (5) zk = h(xk, wk) (6) where k represents the time step index, xk denotes the damage state, θk is a vector of the model parameters, zk indicates measurement data. vk and wk are separately the process and measurement noise. PF is also called the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Interested readers are suggested to refer to [58, 61, 62] for more information of PF in PHM. A Matlab-based tutorial to introduce the PF approach is available in [60]. In their work, An et al. introduced a segment of PF code with a case study of battery degradation. In addition, PF has been adjusted for the prognostics of battery performance. Wang et al. [55] proposed a methodology for the RUL prediction of Li-ion batteries, on the basis of Spherical Cubature Particle Filter (SCPF). SCPF adapts a spherical cubature integration-based Kalman ﬁlter (KF, see e.g. [63]) to generate the impor- tance function of PF. KF assumes that the posterior density at each time step is Gaussian [58]. Miao et al. [64] raised a methodology based on unscented particle ﬁl- ter (UPF) to estimate the RUL of Li-ion batteries. The authors proposed UPF on the basis of PF and Unscented Kalman ﬁlter (UKF) (see e.g. [65, 66, 67]). UPF is able to obtain less estimation error than the standard PF. Su et al. [68] applied interacting multiple model particle ﬁlter (IMMPF) to determine the RUL of Li-ion batteries. Duong and Raghaven [69] combined the Heuristic Kalman algorithm (HKA) and PF 12 for predicting the RUL of Li-ion batteries. HKA can be used to tackle the sample im- poverishment and degeneracy in the standard PF. The prediction results are declared to be more accurate than those of the standard PF. 3D imaging techniques can also be applied to inspect the degradation of batter- ies. The degradation and failure of Li-ion batteries is strongly associated with the electrode microstructure change upon (de)lithiation [70]. The X-ray tomography ap- proach can observe changes in the microstructure of electrodes to cell performance, and predict degradation processes [70]. Degradation behaviors of batteries have also been studied. Wang et al. [71] studied the aging and degradation of Li-ion batteries with applying the non-destructive elec- trochemical approaches. They discover that the capacity loss of a battery is heavily inﬂuenced by its rate, depth of discharge, and temperature. Xu et al. [72] proposed a semi-empirical Li-ion battery degradation model which can evaluate the battery cell life loss, particularly for oﬄine battery life assessment. The model has been obtained by integrating fundamental theories of battery deterioration, such as the Arrhenius relationship and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) ﬁlm formation, and the battery aging test results. Electrochemcial models are also useful for evaluating battery states. He et al. [73] proposed a physics-based electrochemical model for estimating the SOC of Li-ion bat- teries. The electrochemical processes are normally established with a group of coupled partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs). In order to solve the solid-phase diﬀusion PDEs, they put forward an optimised projection-based method and moving-window ﬁltering (MWF). The modiﬁcation of an electrochemical battery model has been proposed to save the computational resources in prognostics [74]. The proposed model can obtain accurate results while reducing the processing time. Pseudo-Two-Dimensional (P2D) model is a widely-used electrochemical model for lithium-ion batteries [75]. A series of PDEs is employed to describe complex physical and chemical characteristics of batteries. Due to the complexity of P2D model, numerical solutions of parameter identiﬁcation and simpliﬁed version of P2D model are available [76]. 4.1.2. Data-driven approaches In the advent of IoT, data from diﬀerent devices in batteries is becoming increas- ingly available. Therefore the applicability of data-driven approaches for battery prognostics is improved as well [77]. Lucu et al. [78] reviewed the self-adaptive ag- ing models for batteries, which include the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Aver- age (ARIMA), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), GPR and ANN.To minimize the testing labors required to develop an accurate aging model, a self-adaptive model can be applied to adapt itself to accommodate better the recently applicable data samples. The authors have also deﬁned criteria for accuracy and computational cost evaluation. Statistical approaches. Statistical approaches mainly include regression approaches and stochastic approaches. GPR is comprised of a global model and its local de- parture [33]. Researchers have applied GPR to forecast the battery SOH [77] and 13 estimate the in-situ battery capacity [79]. Zhou et al. [80] used GPR to forecast the SOH of the Li-ion batteries. The proposed GPRNN (Gaussian process regression with neural network) models are declared to be simpler than other mixture methods, such as GPR and multiscale GPR algorithms. GPRNN models are also capable of conducting real-time prognostics. He et al. [81] proposed a multiscale GPR modeling approach to obtain the SOH of Li-ion batteries. The authors applied the wavelet analysis (see e.g. [82]) to decouple the global degeneration, local reconstruction, and variations in the SOH time series. Yu [83] proposed a methodology by integrating GPR and logistic regression (LR) to forecast the RUL of Li-ion batteries. The mean of the results obtained by using LR and GPR is applied. The other statistical approaches have also been applied for battery prognostics. Based on a bivariate Wiener process (see e.g. [84, 85]), Liu et al. [86] proposed esti- mated RUL of partially degraded components with two performance characteristics. The researchers tested several Li-ion batteries to testify the provided method. They declared that the suggested method is more robust and accurate. Zhou and Huang [87] proposed a methodology based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ARIMA to estimate the RUL of Li-ion batteries. They validated the methodology with an aging test dataset of Li-ion batteries. Xu et al. [88] proposed a Bayesian hierarchical method by combining discharging and degradation processes to predict EOD. Zhang et al. [89] applied Box-Cox transformation (BCT) to convert the capacity data and to build a model between the transformed capacities and corresponding cycles. This model can therefore be used to forecast the battery RUL. The uncertainties of RUL predictions have been considered with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). To predict the EOD by incorporating all discharge cycles, Mishra et al. [90] proposed a Bayesian hierarchical model-based prognostics approach. Machine Learning approaches. Machine learning (ML) approaches have also been applied for the battery prognostics, such as ANN, Support Vector Machines (SVM), RVM, DBN, etc. These ML approaches have also been integrated with them- selves or other methods for the application in more complex situations or the acquire- ment of more comprehensive results. ANN learns a way to produce desired outputs by reacting to given inputs [33]. ANN can be used for prognostics on the condition that the relationship between inputs and outputs has been learned suﬃciently. The learning process intends to determine weight and bias parameters between inputs and outputs, as well as transfer functions between two adjacent layers. You et al. [91] applied an ANN to estimate the SOH of the EV batteries. The interested data (i.e., the current, voltage and temperature) were obtained from a battery management system (BMS) (see e.g. [92, 93, 94]) on the condition that the batteries are charged/discharged dynamically by considering the driving modes. ANN has also been combined with other methods for battery prognostics. Zhou et al. [95] proposed a robust prognostics approach to predict the degeneration and estimate the RUL of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The au- toregressive and moving average (ARMA) model and the time-delay neural network (TDNN) model are integrated to depict the diﬀerent characteristics in PEMFC degra- 14 dation voltage data. The linear pattern is initially described by ARMA model. The remaining nonlinear component is simulated and forecasted by TDNN model. To extend the lifetime and reduce the cost of batteries, especially the PEMFC, Liu et al. [96] demonstrated that the combination of diﬀerent ANN and wavelet decomposi- tion approach can signiﬁcantly increase the accuracy and stability of the short-term (i.e., time length ≤ 50 hours) prognostics. The other learning algorithms of ANN, for example the extreme learning machine (ELM), have also been applied for the battery prognostics. With the features of randomly choosing the hidden units and analytically deciding the output weights for single hidden layer feed forward neural networks (SLFN), ELM can give better generalization performance at an highly rapid learning speed [97]. ELM has been applied for single-step and multistep predictions [98]. Razavi-Far et al. [98] raised a prognostic scheme for predicting the RUL of Li-ion batteries by considering missing observations. The scheme is composed of pre-processing and prediction modules. When the direct data is insuﬃcient, the observations from a ﬂeet of similar batteries with similar working conditions have been utilized to estimate the RUL of a battery via ELM [99]. Pan et al. [100] proposed a multiple health indicator (HI)-based and machine learning-enabled SOH estimator for PHM. HI can be used to quantify the capacity degradation. An ELM was applied to obtain the correlation of the generated HI and capacity degradation. It is reported that ELM learns fast and is highly accurate, when compared with BP neural netwok. SVM has been applied for the battery prognostics as well. SVM solves nonlinear issues by transforming the data into a higher feature space, where a problem becomes linear [101, 102]. Zhou et al. [103] applied ANN and SVM separately on infrared images (i.e., surface temperature proﬁles) to evaluate the cycle life of Li-ion polymer batteries. Their study showed that these two models can obtain similar results, while the SVM models require longer testing time. Gao and Huang [104] used multi-kernel SVM, which is based on the polynomial and radial basis kernel functions, to forecast the RUL of Li-ion batteries. The researchers applied the particle swarm optimization to search essential parameters of the multi-kernel SVM model. When SVM is applied for regression tasks, it is named SVR. SVR is one of the most popular regression approaches [105]. Due to the capability of describing the nonlinear correlation of input and output data, SVR is suitable for prediction tasks [106]. Ma et al. [105] put forward a methodology for SOH prediction of Li-ion batteries by applying the feature fusion and SVR. The authors applied the sliding window to extract features from diﬀerent views during the discharge process of Li-ion batteries. Wang and Mamo [106] proposed a hybrid SVR and diﬀerential evolution (DE) model to increase the accuracy of RUL prediction for Li-ion batteries. DE has been applied to attain the kernal parameters of SVR. RVM, as a sparse Bayesian approach for the kernel regression, carries out regres- sion in a probabilistic way [107]. The sparsity characteristic of the RVM regression model permits to carry out predictions for novel observations in an eﬃcient way [107]. RVM has the identical function form of SVM. Nevertheless, it is capable for provid- ing the probabilistic classiﬁcation. Based on the health features generated from the charging proﬁle (including the voltage, current and temperature proﬁles), the remain- 15 ing capacity of Li-ion batteries has been estimated by using RVM [108]. The grey rational analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) have been used to extract and optimize the related health features. RVM has been integrated with other methods for battery prognostics. Li et al. [109] employed mean entropy and RVM to estimate the RUL of Li-ion batteries. The authors applied the mean entropy to attain the optimal embedding dimension for the correct time series regeneration. They applied RVM subsequently to forecast the SOH and RUL of Li-ion batteries. Zhang et al. [110] proposed a methodology based on the EMD denoising method and multiple kernel relevance vector machine (MKRVM) to evaluate the capacity of the Li-ion battery. The noise-free capacity data can be obtained by applying the EMD denoising approach with the measured capacity data. Based on the noise-free capacity data, its capacity predicting model can thus be established by using MKRVM. Liu et al. [111] applied an optimized RVM to predict the RUL of Li-ion batteries. The extracted HI with battery discharging voltage diﬀerence (DVD) is optimized, with the Box-Cox transformation, to retroﬁt the performance in the RUL prediction. RVM is subsequently applied to indirectly estimate RUL by considering the extracted and optimized HI. The other ML approaches, such as the Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN, see e.g. [112, 113, 114]), have been applied for battery prognostics as well. He et al. [115] applied DBN to evaluate the online SOH of Li-ion batteries. The researchers treated SOC as the hidden states in DBN. They utilized terminal voltages of Li-ion batteries as observations, which are convenient in real applications. Most recently, Severson et al [116] applied data-driven techniques to predict the battery cycle life. They predict battery life based on early life cycles (i.e., ﬁrst 100 cycles) and classiﬁed batteries with ﬁrst 5 cycles. High level of accuracy is attained, partially owing to feature extraction from discharge voltage curves. In [117], the random forest regression method is used for battery health prognostics. The features are extracted from the charging voltage-capacity proﬁle. They compared obtained results with those from GPR and incremental capacity analysis. To carry out data-driven PHM for batteries, we can also learn or employ al- gorithms applied in other domains, such as PHM studies of bearing and gearbox. In [118], RUL prediction of bearings has been conducted by deep neural networks (DNN). In this work, a denoising autoencoder-based DNN is applied to classify sig- nals of monitored bearings into several degradation stages. Subsequently, shallow neural networks-based regression models are proposed for corresponding degradation stages. Eventually, regression results from diﬀerent models are smoothed to obtain RUL. In [119], the short frequency Fourier transform (SFFT) is utilized to attain the time-frequency domain information. The multi-scale feature extraction is carried out by applying the convolutional neural networks (CNN). 4.1.3. Hybrid approaches Hybrid approaches for battery prognostics are mainly related to the PF-related and KF-related approaches. PF can be applied jointly with other approaches to pre- dict the battery RUL. Xing et al. [120] proposed an ensemble approach by integrating an empirical exponential and a polynomial regression models to forecast the RUL of 16 Li-ion batteries. Parameters are adjusted by applying PF in the model. Dong et al. [121] proposed a framework of on-line short-term (e.g., several-step-ahead) SOH evaluation and long-term RUL forecasting by applying the Brownian motion based deterioration model and PF. The framework treated the capacity degeneration as the traveling distance of a Brownian particle in a time interval. PF can estimate the drift parameter of the Brownian motion. Yu [122] presented a battery health prognostics approach on the basis of the Bayesian-inference probabilistic (BIP) indication and state-space model (SSM) that combines LR and PF. Li and Xu [123] integrated GPR and PF to forecast the SOH of Li-ion batteries. Mixture of Gaussian process (MGP) is ﬁrstly applied to learn the statistical properties of the deterioration process. On the basis of the parameter distribution in the degradation process, PF is used to estimate battery SOH. Liao and K¨ottig [16] applied SVR and PF for prognostics of batteries. Sbarufatti et al. [56] presented an approach for the adaptive prognostics of Li-ion battery terminal voltage. The authors integrated PF and the radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (see e.g. [124, 125, 126]), where PF can ascertain the parameters of RBF dynamically. The algorithm can adapt to the changing dy- namics generated by the battery aging eﬀect. Cadini et al. [127] proposed an hybrid approach, by integrating PF and multilayer perception (MLP) neural networks, for prognostics of batteries. PF is used to recursively determine the posterior probability density function (pdf) of the MLP parameters. For a linear system with Gaussian noise, PF reduces itself to KF [128]. Based on an iteratively renewed RVM integrated with the KF algorithm, Song et al. [129] predicted the RUL of Li-ion batteries. The authors applied KF to optimize an esti- mator, generated by RVM, with a physical degradation model. Subsequently, they added the optimized estimator as an online sample. By integrating UKF, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and RVM, Chang et al. [130] raised a hybrid method to obtain the RUL of Li-ion batteries. They initially ob- tained a prognostics result and a raw error series by using UKF. They updated the raw error series by utilizing CEEMD. Based on the novel error series, prognostic er- ror is predicted by using RVM. Prognostics results attained by UKF are updated by the prognostics error. Bai et al. [131] integrated a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) (see e.g. [132, 133]) and KF to depict the battery system dynamics. They testiﬁed the proposed method subsequently with a set of the battery experimental data. Misyris et al. [134] estimated SOC for Li-ion Batteries with an accurate hybrid approach. In their work, the Fast Upper-triangular and Diagonal Recursive Least Squares (FUDRLS) with varying forgetting factors and the Approximate Weighted Total Least Squares (AWTLS) algorithms have been applied to identify parameters and estimate capacities. The Coulomb Counting (CC), Linear Kalman Filter (LKF) and open circuit voltage (OCV)-based methods have been utilized to estimate the SOC. The other hybrid approaches have also been applied for the battery prognostics. Wang et al. [135] used RVM and a capacity deterioration model to estimate the RUL of Li-ion batteries. They applied relevance vectors to discover representative training vectors. Those training vectors, together with the nonlinear least squares regression, are utilized to calculate the parameters of the battery capacity deterioration model. 17 A hybrid method, the improved bird swarm algorithm optimization least squares support vector machine (IBSA-LSSVM), has been proposed to estimate the RUL of Li-ion batteries [136]. IBSA is applied to determine the optimum parameters of the LSSVM model. The method is declared to obtain higher prediction accuracy and stability. We summarize the above prognostics approaches for batteries in Table 3. 4.2. Health management of batteries Health management is the procedure of decision-making and action implemen- tation on the basis of the evaluation of the SOH derived from health monitoring and future application scenarios of the system [14]. Besides the prognostics, health management is another indispensable part for PHM. With the advanced warning of impending failures, we are able to apply prognostics results for maintenance plan and contingency mitigation [16]. Several researchers treat the battery health management (BHM) as BMS [18, 141, 142]. BMS can measure and estimate the functional sta- tus of a battery [93]. It has been applied to ensure the battery a safe, reliable, and cost-eﬃcient solution. In addition, BHM can make future operational policies for the usage management and lifetime extension, maintenance costs reduction, and safety incidents prevention [93]. In the operation of batteries, it is required to take into account the health manage- ment. The degradation behavior of the electrochemical energy storage (EES, a.k.a. batteries) aﬀects its operational decisions and economic assessments [143]. Perez et al. [144] developed a combined economic-degradation model to evaluate the eﬀects of operational strategies on the total revenue, multi-service portfolios, deterioration, and lifespan of energy storage plants. The storage management strategy of Li-ion batter- ies, by considering the economic analysis and charging/discharging management, is helpful for the day-ahead optimal operation scheduling of the micro grid [145]. The optimal schedule is applied to minimize the operation cost of the micro grid, as well as the battery depreciation cost. Maintenance actions for batteries mainly include the repair and replacement. For example, an IEEE Recommend Practice is available for the maintenance of the Valve- Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) batteries [146]. Maintenance is used to ensure a sound status of the battery in its life cycle, thus to fulﬁll the required reliability and availabil- ity [147]. Battery maintenance should be performed with the specialized knowledge of batteries and the safety precautions involved [146]. Once there is a faulty cell in a battery pack, we need to replace it. Battery replacement criteria includes the battery capacity, service test results, new load requirements, abnormally high tem- perature, etc. [146]. Replacement cells, if applied, need to ensure that their electrical characteristics are compatible with already existed cells and are testiﬁed prior to installation [146]. Due to the inherent aging eﬀect, the capacity of the degraded bat- tery is usually lower than a new one [148]. Therefore it is necessary to select proper replacement cells to avoid the electrical imbalance [148]. The operation and maintenance of batteries have to be considered integrally if necessary. An optimal management/schedule is capable of decreasing the operational costs and expanding the lifespan of batteries. The objective function of such an 18 Table 3: Introductory summarization of prognostics approaches for batteries.

The constraints are the degradation rates, the working environment and the operational modes of batteries. The downtime cost is related to the failure-detection cost, the maintenance cost, as well as the test cost. The maintenance cost is dependent on the cell value, repair crew expense, logistics expense, time delay, etc. Bordin et al. [149] raised the linear programming models for the optimum management of storage units (especially the batteries) in oﬀ-grid systems. The developed methodology considered the battery degradation cost and replacement cost in the optimization models. They discussed how the operational modes of an oﬀ-grid power system can aﬀect the aging costs of batteries. He et al. [143] proposed an intertemporal decision framework, which includes the replacement options, to generate the optimal solution for maximizing the life-cycle proﬁt of EES. The framework has considered the operating (including short, mid, and long terms) and planning phases of EES. 5. Discussions With the continuous evolution of engineered systems, their increasing complexity and dynamics add diﬃculties to the battery PHM. Simultaneously, the risk of failure propagation can bring new challenges for current PHM activities. Therefore there are eﬀorts remain to improve current PHM methods. For instance, we need to propose optimal maintenance strategies by considering the uncertainties of prognostics results and system operations. 5.1. Approach selection for prognostics In the prognostics domain, due to the diﬀerent system complexities, data avail- abilities and application constraints, there is no accepted best model to estimate RUL [16]. However, one algorithm can outperform another one in a particular situa- tion [13]. The comparison of the prognostic algorithms for predicting RUL of batteries can be found in [150]. To select appropriate approaches for battery PHM, we need to consider the re- quirements from the users and decision makers, such as the working environment, the accuracy and the period of time to be predicted. Operations research (OR) methods can be applied to select optimal methods by considering the cost and beneﬁt. For example, to choose suitable approaches for battery prognostics, we can adopt the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) (see e.g. [151, 152, 153, 154]) to support the multiple criteria decision analysis. In this manuscript, PHM methods in the literature are usually discussed with spe- ciﬁc types of commercial batteries in case studies. These methods are not necessarily applicable to other classes of batteries, even naturally to the identical type of batter- ies (e.g., diﬀerent manufacturers or variant chemical concentrations of electrodes and electrolytes). However, when confronted with a new battery case, the review work can be helpful by considering diﬀerences of target batteries and those in literature, working conditions, accuracy requirement, and data availability. 20 5.2. Health management Signiﬁcant eﬀorts have been devoted to prognostics in the battery PHM studies, that is, the estimation of current situations and the prediction of future scenarios. However, it is far from integrated for PHM. We need to consider the health manage- ment as an indispensable part of PHM. Due to the pervasive application of batteries and diﬃculties encountered in accidents, we need to devote more eﬀorts to the domain of battery emergency management, which to our knowledge has not been suﬃciently researched. With the prepared handling strategies, we can reduce the potential losses eﬀectively and eﬃciently. To ensure the stable working of systems in both nominal operation and emergency scenario, we can investigate the eﬃcient and resilient man- agement of spare parts and emergency supplies. In addition, we can establish an integrated deployment model of system operation and spare parts management by taking into account prognostics results and maintenance strategies. By considering the spare parts, requirements, uncertainty levels, component importance, manufac- turing characteristics and distribution eﬃciency, we can propose a prediction model of spare parts requirements. To eﬀectively cope with emergency incidents, we need to re-schedule system maintenance activities and provide dynamic emergency strategies, including the personnel deploy and emergency supplies. 5.3. Performance evaluation Performance evaluation of PHM includes the assessment of PHM methods and the evaluation of PHM results. PHM methods are the approaches as we discussed in Section 4. PHM results are the prognostics outcomes and maintenance strategies that can be obtained by using the PHM methods. On the one hand, we can assess the PHM methods in several aspects, such as the algorithm convergence, the computational complexity, the cost-beneﬁt risk, and the ease of the algorithm certiﬁcation [30]. For example, we need to evaluate diﬀerent prognostics approaches by considering above aspects before their applications. On the other hand, we can evaluate the PHM results through the veriﬁcation and validation activities. Regarding the veriﬁcation, which is a quality control pro- cess [13], we need to review if the PHM results can fulﬁll the basic PHM principles as we discussed in Section 2. In terms of the validation, which is a quality assurance process [13], we can check if the PHM results can meet the speciﬁc accuracy and precision requirements. 5.4. Uncertainty treatment Due to the incomplete knowledge of systems, lack of the accurate sensing, vari- ability of future operating and loading conditions [13], it is necessary to consider the uncertainty in PHM process. If the uncertainty in prognostics were not considered, the prediction would be useless for the decision making [13]. A key aspect of prognos- tics is not only to predict future values of related variables but also to express their uncertainties (aleatory and epistemic) associated with these values [77, 128]. By considering the uncertainties generated from current states, future states, mod- eling and prediction, we can determine the importance measures of components. By 21 taking into account the maintenance cost and the operability, we can propose a de- cision model for operation and maintenance. Robust optimization applies several approaches for protecting decision-makers against the parameter ambiguity and the stochastic uncertainty[155, 156]. Therefore we can also develop robust optimization scheme to deal with PHM uncertainties. By considering diﬀerent working scenar- ios and unstable system inputs, we can put forward a robust maintenance/operation optimization to meet availability requirements of equipment. In this way, we can maximize the equipment RUL and minimize the cost of operation and maintenance. 5.5. Economics of application To commercialize the application of PHM in engineering domains, it is necessary to provide PHM solutions with low cost and high performance. The eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of PHM needs to be economically viable [157]. For example, we can acquire beneﬁts of prognostics in the life cycle of a system, including the processes of design and development, production, operations, logistics support, as well as the maintenance [158]. The cost of prognostics include the acquisition and installation costs, implementation costs, changes in business practices, and the cost of product redesign [158]. Return on investment (ROI) is a popular metrics that can be applied in a cost beneﬁt quantitative analysis [159, 158]. 5.6. Environmental issue Battery industry can bring various environmental pollutants, including toxic gases, greenhouse gas emissions, and hazardous waste in the battery lifecycle [160]. There- fore the environmental issue has to be taken into account. Environmental issues related to lithium-ion batteries include the working environment and wastewater is- sue. For example, in the usage (charging/discharging) phase, lithium-ion batteries can bring additional heat to the surrounding environment, which has the risk of lead- ing to ﬁre and explosion, and subsequent chemical harm to the environment. In the disposal phase, such as those batteries replaced by novel ones, it is required to take environmental eﬀect into consideration. Related decision-making should be responsi- ble to the whole society, rather than merely high availability of lithium-ion batteries. Among them, wastewater issue related to batteries cannot be neglected, which should be an obbligato part of the battery lifecycle. Overall, it has to be mentioned that PHM of batteries has its advantages and drawbacks, as is listed in Table 4. By using PHM, it enables us to obtain and pre- dict the battery health. By utilizing prognostics results, engineers can proactively take measures (e.g., terminate and replace related batteries) to maintain the battery availability and forbid unexpected incidents. Adversely, it also takes signiﬁcant ef- forts to conduct credible ROI analysis. And it also requires detailed electrochemical knowledge to explain, verify and update the PHM models of batteries. 22 Table 4: A summary of the advantages and drawbacks of battery PHM. Advantages Drawbacks - Prognostics mission can beneﬁt from the advancement of sensor technology and availability of eﬃcient algorithms and computation resources. - In a laboratory, it would be easier to obtain health parameters for PHM. In practice, it costs money in PHM imple- mentation. Credible analysis of return on investment (ROI) of PHM is nec- essary for decision-makers for practical application. - Health performance and RUL of bat- teries can be predicted according to the current status. - It requires sophisticated electrochemi- cal domain knowledge to explain, verify and update PHM models of batteries. - Prognostics results enable engineers to proactively take measure to opti- mize mission and replacement strate- gies, even to forbid severe accidents. 6. Conclusion In this paper, we reviewed literature related to battery PHM methods, particularly prognostics methods of lithium-ion batteries. There exists no individual perfect ap- proach for battery PHM, due to the advantages and constraints of each approach. Selection of an approach requires to take the user requirement, data availability and degradation mechanisms attainability into consideration. Three types of battery prognostics approaches are thoroughly discussed. Regarding data-driven prognostics approaches, they highly rely on the quality and quantity of monitoring data and fea- ture engineering techniques. However, they are relatively free from detailed domain knowledge. In terms of physics-based prognostics approaches, they can work with limited data. Nevertheless, sophisticated knowledge of aging mechanisms is required instead. Hybrid approaches can be regarded as a generalization of data-driven and physics-based approaches. In a nutshell, the review showed that, with complex battery systems, working conditions and monitored data, machine learning-based data-driven approaches are becoming more and more conducive. Hybrid approaches, by integrating data-driven and physic-based methods, are also promising in the domain of battery PHM. Based on the review study, we proposed research and development perspectives to conduct further studies on the battery PHM, which include the approach selection, health management, performance evaluation, uncertainty treatment, application economics, as well as environmental issues. 23 References [1] J.-M.
