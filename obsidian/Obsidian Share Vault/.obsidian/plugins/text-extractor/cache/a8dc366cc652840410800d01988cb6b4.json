In the current work, series bench-scale tests are conducted using a cone calorimeter to explore the ﬁre behavior of lithium-ion battery. The inﬂuence of two key factors, namely state of charge (SOC) and incident external heat ﬂux, on the battery ﬁre characteristics is especially investigated. Combustion behavior, time to ignition (TTI), heat release rate (HRR) and ﬁre risk assessment are obtained. The battery with higher SOC under high incident heat ﬂux presents a ﬁerce combustion process and higher surface temperature than the others. It is noteworthy that the time to ignition and time to peak HRR (TTP) decrease with the SOC, whereas the peak HRR (pHRR) and total heat release (THR) increase overall. On the whole, the increment of incident heat ﬂux causes the decrease in TTI and TTP, while the pHRR and THR increase at higher incident heat ﬂux. And the values of TTI agree well with the classical ignition model. Finally, the ﬁre risk of battery with different SOCs under various incident heat ﬂuxes is also highlighted. Keywords Lithium-ion battery \u0002 Fire behavior \u0002 Heat release rate \u0002 Hazard assessment Introduction Due to the excellent features of lithium-ion battery including energy density, high power capacity, stable volt- age, long life cycle and low self-discharge [1, 2], it has been widely applied in various ﬁelds of applications, such as portable electronics, electric vehicles and energy storage [3]. Nevertheless, lithium-ion battery contains highly energetic materials and combustible materials (i.e., elec- trode, separator, electrolyte and organic solvents), once it is abused in overcharging, short circuit, extrusion, collision and exposed in ﬁre, etc., which can trigger thermal run- away and lead to ﬁre and explosion eventually [4, 5]. A number of related accidents involving lithium-ion battery have been reported [6–8]. For instance, two Japan Airlines’ Boeing 787 ﬁre accidents in 2013 are caused by airborne lithium batteries, and then, FAA announced that the B787 will be stopped around world [8]. Therefore, to ensure the safety of transportation and storage, it is necessary to study ﬁre behavior of lithium-ion battery. Various researches have been carried out to study the thermal stability of battery materials [9, 10]. All the studies mostly focused on the internal electrochemical reactions inside the battery and thermal runaway mechanism [11–13]. The ﬁre behaviors of the batteries under heating conditions are also important. Ribiere et al. [14] studied the ﬁre-induced hazards of 2.9 Ah pouch-type batteries at 100%, 50% and 0% SOC using ﬁre propagation apparatus (Tewarson calorimeter) and found that even a single bat- tery can release fairly intense heat and toxic gases. Larsson et al. [1] conducted the ﬁre tests on commercial lithium-ion battery cells using a Single Burning Item (SBI) apparatus, and both the HRR and the emission of toxic gases were measured and calculated. Fu et al. [15] per- formed an experimental study on burning behaviors of 18650 lithium-ion batteries at various SOCs using a cone calorimeter and proposed that the peak HRR and toxic & Jian Wang wangj@ustc.edu.cn 1 State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, Anhui, People’s Republic of China 2 School of Environment and Safety Engineering, University of Jiangsu, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China 123 Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry https://doi.org/10.1007/s10973-018-7899-y (0123456789().,-volV)(0123456789().,-volV) gases concentration increase with the SOC. Huang et al. [16] and Wang et al. [17] explored the combustion behavior of large-scale lithium–titanate battery under low heat radiation condition and indicated that the battery ﬁre hazard increases with the SOC. Ping et al. [18] conducted full-scale burning tests of high-energy lithium-ion batteries based on the ISO 9705 Full-Scale Room Fire test appara- tus, and observed that the maximum HRR, overall heat generation and mass loss increase with increasing SOC. Chen et al. [19–21] experimentally investigated the effects of ambient pressure, cell numbers, arrangement and SOC on combustion characteristics using an in situ calorimeter. Ouyang et al. [22, 23] studied the thermal behaviors and ﬁre hazards of lithium-ion batteries under discharge and overcharge conditions, respectively. However, most studies mentioned above have concerned only the low external heat ﬂux. The combustion behaviors of battery under high incident heat ﬂux have been investigated only rarely in published works. In this paper, the ﬁre behavior of single lithium-ion battery was experimentally examined using a cone calorimeter. The combustion characteristics of single bat- tery with different SOCs at varied high incident heat ﬂuxes were quantitatively investigated. The burning phenomenon, time to ignition, heat release rate and ﬁre risk assessment were measured and analyzed. Based on the experimental results, the ﬁre hazards of battery that rapidly arise when higher SOC lithium-ion battery and higher incident heat ﬂux are involved in a ﬁre scenario are presented. Experimental Samples The 18650 lithium-ion batteries with a diameter of 18 mm and a height of 65 mm used in the current work are man- ufactured by SAMSUNG. The batteries mainly consist of a cathode (positive plate), an anode (negative plate), a sep- arator and electrolyte. The cathode is a LiNixCoyMn1\u0003x\u0003yO2 (NCM), and the anode is graphite. The separator is a thin micro-perforated plastic sheet al- lowing the ions to pass through. The electrolyte is a solu- tion consisting of organic solvent and inorganic salt providing the media for lithium ions transport. A burst disk is used as safety vent to release gases inside the battery in some abuse conditions. Schematic diagram of 18650 lithium-ion battery is shown in Fig. 1. The normal capacity of the battery is 1.3 Ah. The electrochemical reactions of the battery during charging and discharging can be repre- sented as [9, 24]: Cathode : LiNixCoyMn1\u0003x\u0003yO2 !

Then, the batteries are charged to the expected states of charge including the 0%, 30%, 50%, 80% and 100% SOC using a constant current–constant voltage process. Hereafter, all the batteries would be left standing for 24 h to ensure the batteries remain stable before experiments. Table 1 shows the information of experimental conﬁgurations. Apparatus The ﬁre behavior of lithium-ion batteries was studied using a cone calorimeter. All tests were conducted following the recommendations from ISO 5660 standard [25]. The bat- teries were ﬁxed on the upper surface of a steel grid, which was tightly placed horizontally upon a sample holder made of steel pan. This can eliminate the battery movement and ensure the heat ﬂux absorbed by battery. The distance between the samples and the cone heater was ﬁxed to 25 mm. A ﬁreproof board was used underneath the sample holder for the thermal insulation. In order to obtain the surface temperature of battery, a K-type thermocouple with a diameter of 1 mm was wound around sample using steel wire attaching the battery surface. The cone calorimeter was calibrated according to the procedure in the ISO 5660 standard before tests. The batteries were exposed to various high heat ﬂuxes from 25 to 75 kW m -2. The incident heat ﬂuxes applied were 25 kW m-2,35 kW m-2,50 kW m-2 and 75 kW m-2 corresponding to low thermal aggression situation, a mild ﬁre, a ﬂashover situation, strong and sudden thermal aggression stress, respectively. The com- bustion products were collected by a hood and transported away through a exhaust system with air volume ﬂow rate of 24 L s-1 driven by a fan. CO, CO2 and O2 gas analyzers were used to measure the generation of carbon oxides and oxygen depletion [15]. A digital camera (JVC, 25 fps) was positioned to record the combustion process of the battery. All tests were carried out in a enclosed room Z. Wang et al. 123 (5 m 9 4m 9 3 m) regarded as a quasi-static environ- ment. The ambient temperature is 14 ± 3 \u0003C, and the relative humidity is 45 ± 4%. Each test was repeated at least two times, and the average values were taken to minimize experimental error. Figure 2 presents the spatial arrangement of the test. Results and discussion Combustion behavior The combustion behavior of batteries is related to the SOC and incident heat ﬂux. In this work, the batteries were heated to burning by a cone heater.

The combus- tion behavior can be divided into initial heating to ignition, violent ejecting, stable burning and gradual declining stages [19]. At the heating stage, the battery was heated with no ﬂame presented for a period of time. Under the continuous heating, the thermal runaway of battery occurred followed by spill of decomposition gases or electrolyte vapor and auto-ignition. For the battery of 30% SOC in 35 kW m -2, a sustainable ﬂame was observed above the battery from 230.20 s to 277.03 s after ignition. For the battery of 100% SOC in 75 kW m-2, an ejection lasted for several seconds until the burning process goes into a stable combustion stage, which was more than ten seconds. As the temperature ascends, the battery underwent a series of exothermic chemical reactions in the inner [4, 26]. Besides, the internal pressure of battery increased sharply by the production and accumulation of gases [16]. Once the pressure exceeds the threshold value of safety valve, the combustible gases will be released and ignited instantaneously; then, a ﬁerce ejecting ﬂame formed. It started to eject at 278.84 s for the battery of 30% SOC in 35 kW m-2 and 75.40 s for the battery of 100% SOC in 75 kW m-2, respectively. Strong reaction and violent ejection at this time for 100% SOC in 75 kW m-2 makes the combustion behavior more complicated and difﬁcult to be predicted. This could be applied to explain the uncertain change of heat release for batteries with high state of charge or under high incident heat ﬂux. Soon after, the combustion without big ﬁre of battery became stable and this stage kept for about 12.52 s (30% SOC in 35 kW m -2) and 7.72 s (100% SOC in 75 kW m -2). Finally, the com- bustion declined gradually until it extinguished. The combustion processes could also be reﬂected from the change in surface temperature, as plotted in Fig. 4. Ignition of batteries Time to ignition (TTI) is deﬁned as the duration time between the sample exposed to incident heat ﬂux and a visible, continuous ﬂame ﬁrstly established. TTI for bat- teries plays an important role in ﬁre growth. The time for ignition to occur has not been carefully investigated for batteries with different SOCs under varied incident heat ﬂuxes. The TTI results of batteries are presented in Fig. 5. It can be observed that the TTI changes obviously with SOCs under the same incident heat ﬂux. In general, the battery with the higher SOC has the shorter TTI.

Wang et al. 123 80% and 100% SOC are 265.67 s, 329.01 s, 295.08 s, 265.35 s and 213.12 s, respectively, at incident heat ﬂux of 25 kW m-2. It also can be seen that the TTI is inversely related to the incident heat ﬂux. For the battery with 50% SOC, the TTI values are 295.08 s, 256.01 s, 95.64 s and 61.58 s under the incident heat ﬂuxes from 25 to 75 kW m-2. The difference of TTI indicates that the heat transfer and concentration of combustible gases are altered. Previous have deduced and developed the classical models to predict the time to ignition of thermally thick samples under different external heat ﬂuxes [27–29]. Quintiere [27] theoretically studied the relationship between the time to ignition and external heat ﬂux and deduced the classical formula as follows: 1 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ TTI p ¼ 1 ﬃﬃﬃ p p 2 q00 e : ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ kqcTig \u0003 T1 \u0003\u0004q ð4Þ where k, q and c are deﬁned as heat conductivity (W m-1 K-1), density (kg m-3) and speciﬁc heat (J kg-1 K -1), respectively. Tig and T1 are the temperature to ignition (K) and the room temperature (K). q00 e : represents the external heat ﬂux (kW m-2). Namely, the root mean square of TTI is inverse function of the incident heat ﬂux, TTI\u00030:5 / q00 e : . Delichatsios [28] introduced the critical heat ﬂux and heat loss into the ignition process of thermally thick material to improve the predictive accuracy. The relationship is as follows: 1 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ TTI p ¼ 1 ﬃﬃﬃ p p 2 q00 e : þaq00 ig;crit : ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ kqcTig \u0003 T1 \u0003\u0004q ð5Þ where q00 ig;crit : is the critical heat ﬂux (kW m-2). Janssens [29] used the statistical methods to develop and optimize the prediction model for the ignition of thermally thick material, and proposed the following formula q00 e : ¼ q00 ig;crit : 1 þ 0:73 kqc h2 igTTI !0:55 2 4 3 5 ð6Þ where hig is the heat loss coefﬁcient from the surface in the process of ignition (W m-2 K-1). The plots of TTI-0.55 versus incident heat ﬂux for different SOCs batteries are shown in Fig. 6. The symbols and lines, respectively, represent the experiment data and the ﬁtting values. It is noteworthy that the model of TTI\u00030:55 / q00 e : allows ﬁtting well with the experimental values. Indeed, the thermally thick properties of the batteries used in this study are conﬁrmed. And the TTI values depend on the heat imposed and the ﬂammability properties of the decomposition gases. This implied the change in temperature proﬁle and gases (i.e., type, concentration) occurred in batteries at different SOCs under varied imposed heat ﬂuxes, which corresponds to the above analysis of combustion process. Heat release rate Heat release rate (HRR) is one of the most important parameters to deﬁne the ﬁre hazard, which needs to be considered seriously when assessing the ﬁre risk of battery. Several methodologies (i.e., oxygen depletion, mass loss, temperature rise) are proposed to calculate the HRR [15]. In this paper, the HRR is determined by oxygen depletion based on Thornton’s principle [30] and Huggett’s relation [31], which is the most widely used method. For a com- plete combustion process, the HRR can be estimated using Eq. (4). 20 0% SOC 30% SOC 50% SOC 80% SOC 100% SOC 30 40 50 Incident heat flux/kW m–2 60 70 80 60 0TTI/s 120 180 240 300 360 Fig. 5 Time to ignition for batteries at different SOCs under varied incident heat ﬂuxes 20 30 40 50 Incident heat flux/kW m–2 60 70 80 0% SOC 30% SOC 50% SOC 80% SOC 100% SOC 0.02TTI–0.55/s–0.55 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 Fig. 6 Plots of TTI -0.55 versus incident heat ﬂux for batteries at different SOCs Fire behavior of lithium-ion battery with different states of charge induced by high incident heat ﬂuxes 123 HRR ¼ E _m 0 O2 \u0003 _me O2 \u0005\u0006 As ð7Þ where HRR is the heat release rate (kW m -2). E is the energy released per mass unit of oxygen consumed for a given fuel (* 13.1 ± 5% MJ kg-1)[31]. _m 0 O2 is the initial mass ﬂow rate of oxygen from the incoming air (kg s-1). _me O2 is the mass ﬂow rate of oxygen in the exhaust duct (kg s-1). As is the initial exposure surface area (m2). While on most cases, combustion is found to be incomplete implying the carbon oxides and soot particles formation [16]. Thus, the calculation of HRR should take the con- centration of CO and CO2 into account. Figure 7 shows the HRR curves of batteries with the SOCs from 0% to 100% under an incident heat ﬂux of 75 kW m-2. HRR ﬁrst increases rapidly up to the peak value (pHRR), and then, it drops progressively to zero. The SOC has an observable effect on both the change of HRR with time and the magnitude of the pHRR. On the overall trend, time to peak HRR (TTP) and duration of burning tend to decrease with SOC, while the pHRR increases with SOC. The values of pHRR of 0%, 30%, 50%, 80% and 100% SOC, respectively, reach 307.14 kW m-2, 589.20 kW m-2, 1056.95 kW m-2, 814.49 kW m -2 and 848.55 kW m-2. The TTP data are 79.73 s, 110.39 s, 81.34 s, 86.00 s and 78.98 s for 0%, 30%, 50%, 80% and 100% SOC, respectively. Note that the higher the SOC is, the higher the ﬁre risk is. It is possible because the elec- trical energy stored in battery as the potential chemical energy impacts the heat release [15]. In detail, the battery with high SOC is more unstable, the exothermic electro- chemical reactions in inner are more energetic, the gener- ation of heat and combustible gases is larger, and the easier the combustion and explosion occur. The deviations of TTP and pHRR are interpretable and acceptable, which is due to incomplete combustion and internally released oxygen. Figure 8 shows the HRR curves of batteries with 50% SOC under incident heat ﬂuxes in the range of 25–75 kW m-2. The HRR curves of batteries under inci- dent heat ﬂuxes of 50 kW m-2 and 75 kW m -2 present the similar trend, while the others closely resemble. The pHRR values increase from 557.80 to 1056.95 kW m -2 when the imposed heat ﬂuxes increase from 25 to 75 kW m -2, while the TTP values decrease from 322.25 s to 81.34 s. Under the high incident heat ﬂuxes, the combustion of batteries is more vigorous and the ﬁre hazard rises, which is because the increase in incident heat ﬂux can enhance the thermal degradation and thermal runaway reactions. Multiplied by the battery surface area, the resulting pHRR value (kW) is plotted in Fig. 9. The total heat release (THR) can be calculated based on the results of integrating the HRR curves with time, which is depicted in Fig. 10. As shown in Fig. 9, the pHRR values of 0%, 30%, 50%, 80% and 100% SOC are about in the range of 1.5–5.6 kW, 4.1–7.3 kW, 4.9–9.3 kW, 5.6–8.7 kW and 7.5–8.3 kW under varied incident heat ﬂuxes. As shown in Fig. 10, the THR values end up as approximately 70.1–162.2 kJ, 79.6–167.3 kJ, 62.2–166.3 kJ, 70.1–142.4 kJ and 117.6–128.7 kJ for 0%, 30%, 50%, 80 and 100% SOC under different incident heat ﬂuxes, respectively. It can be found that the pHRR and THR of batteries with higher SOCs are slightly lower than others, especially under the larger imposed external heat ﬂux. This might be attributed to three aspects: The more energy a battery stored, the more violent the ejections are, which restricts the oxygen consumption, leading to incomplete combustion; the thermal runaway occurred earlier for high SOC batteries results into no enough time for sufﬁcient chemical reaction to release thermal energy [14, 19]; the 0 0 50 100 Time/sHeat release rate/kW m–2 150 200 250 300 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 75 kW m –2 0% SOC 30% SOC 50% SOC 80% SOC 100% SOC Fig. 7 Heat release rate of batteries at different SOCs under an incident heat ﬂux of 75 kW m-2 100 200 300 400 500 Time/s 0 0Heat release rate/kW m–2 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 50% SOC 75 kW m–2 50 kW m–2 35 kW m –2 25 kW m –2 Fig. 8 Heat release rate of batteries with 50% SOC under different incident heat ﬂuxes Z. Wang et al. 123 oxygen released from the internal electrochemical reac- tions is involved in the combustion [32], which causes the prediction error of HRR based on the oxygen depletion principle. Although the batteries with high SOC release less heat under high incident heat ﬂux, it is seen that the violent ejection and even explosion make them more riskier. This has been conﬁrmed in above sections. Hence, the ﬁre hazard of batteries stored high SOC or the batteries exposed in high incident heat ﬂux should be focused on. Fire risk assessment FPI (ﬁre performance Index) and FGI (ﬁre grow index) are the important parameters to assess the ﬁre risk of materials [33]. FPI is deﬁned as the ratio of time to ignition and peek heat release rate, namely FPI ¼ TTI=pHRR: FGI is deﬁned as the ratio of peek heat release rate and time to peak heat release rate, namely FGI ¼ pHRR=TTP: The materials with high FPI and low FGI could be recognized as having the lower level of ﬁre risk. Figure 11 shows the values of FPI and FGI for batteries with various SOCs under dif- ferent incident heat ﬂuxes. As the incident heat ﬂux increases, the FPI values of batteries decrease, while the FGI values increase. The battery with high SOC has the larger FGI and smaller FPI under the same incident heat ﬂux. For 0%, 50% and 100% SOC battery, the smallest FPI is calculated as 0.058 m2 skW-1, 0.072 m2 skW-1 and 0.070 m2 skW -1 under incident heat ﬂux of 75 kW m-2, respectively. Meanwhile, the highest FGI is 12.994 kW m-2 s-1, 9.471 kW m -2 s-1 and 10.744 kW m-2 s-1 for 0%, 50% and 100% SOC battery, respectively. It can also be concluded that the batteries with no less than 50% SOC are more dangerous than the others. Petrella [34] proposed a method for combining the combustion parameter X and the THR to assess the thermal hazard of materials. X is deﬁned as the ratio of pHRR and TTI, namely X ¼ pHRR=TTI: Evaluation criteria of parameter X and THR for identifying the risk classiﬁcation of materials are listed in Table 2. The experimental data of batteries are plotted in Fig. 12. The ﬁre risk of battery is extremely inﬂuenced by the SOC and incident heat ﬂux. X is above 1.0 kW m -2 s-1, and the THR is above 10 kJ, indicating that the batteries used in this work are seriously hazardous. It can also be found that the risk increases 20 30 40 50 Incident heat flux/kW m–2 60 70 80 0% SOC 30% SOC 50% SOC 80% SOC 100% SOC 2 0Peak heat release rate/kW 4 6 8 10 12 14 Fig. 9 Peak heat release rate for batteries at different SOCs under varied incident heat ﬂuxes 20 0Total heat release/kJ 30 40 50 Incident heat flux/kW m –2 60 70 80 0% SOC 30% SOC 50% SOC 80% SOC 100% SOC 30 60 90 120 150 180 Fig. 10 Total heat release for batteries at different SOCs under varied incident heat ﬂuxes 20 30 40 50 Incident heat flux/kW m–2 60 70 80 0.0 0.2FPI/m2 s kW–1 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 2FGI/kW m–2 s–1 0 4 6 8 10 12 14 0% SOC 30% SOC 50% SOC 80% SOC 100% SOC Fig. 11 FPI and FGI for batteries at different states of charge under varied incident heat ﬂuxes Table 2 Thermal hazard assessment system Values Risk classiﬁcation X THR 0.1–1.0 Low risk Lower risk 1.0–10 Intermediate risk Low risk 10–100 High risk Intermediate risk 100–1000 Very high risk High risk Fire behavior of lithium-ion battery with different states of charge induced by high incident heat ﬂuxes 123 markedly when SOC or incident heat ﬂux increases. This consists in the results of using FPI and FGI to assess the ﬁre risk. Conclusions The ﬁre characteristics of 18650 lithium-ion batteries (NCM) were investigated employing the cone calorimeter in this study. Batteries with different SOCs were tested under various imposed incident heat ﬂuxes. The time to ignition, heat release rate and ﬁre risk assessment were estimated and discussed. The following conclusion can be addressed: (1) The combustion process of batteries could be clearly summarized into the following stages: heating to ignition, violent ejecting or explosion, stable burning and weakening and extinguishment. The results show that both the SOC and incident heat ﬂux have signiﬁcant impact on the combustion behavior of battery. The battery with high SOC presents a ﬁerce combustion process and higher surface temperature than the others, especially when imposed with the high external heat ﬂux. (2) The overall TTI of high SOC battery is shorter than low one, regardless of the incident heat ﬂux. The battery is prone to thermal degradation, thermal runaway and further ignition when the incident heat ﬂux increases. The experimental data of TTI are in good agreement with the classical ignition model from the linear ﬁtting. As a result, the high SOC battery under the high incident heat ﬂux has the highest risk of ignition. (3) The HRR, TTP, pHRR and THR of battery are affected by SOC and incident heat ﬂux. On the whole, the pHRR and THR roughly increase as the incident heat ﬂux increases, while the TTP decreases. Under the same incident heat ﬂux, the maximum pHRR and THR are not observed occasionally in the combustion process of 100% SOC battery due to the uncertain violent ejection and explosion causing the incomplete burning. However, it still indicates that the high SOC battery is more dangerous than the others. (4) The ﬁre risk evaluated based on the assessment methods shows that the high SOC battery possesses the higher ﬁre hazard than lower SOC battery. The increase in incident heat ﬂux can also trigger the higher risk. The current observation coincides with the above combustion analysis of battery. Finally, the toxic gases emissions is another key factor related to battery ﬁre. We should perform experimental and theoretical work to investigate the component and con- centration of toxic gases release, and thus improve the method of ﬁre risk assessment for battery ﬁre in the future. Besides, violent ejection quantiﬁed should also be added in the thermal hazard assessment system.
