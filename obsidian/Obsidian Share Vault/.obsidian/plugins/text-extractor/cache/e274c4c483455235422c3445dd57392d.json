Fathom Engineering • Engineering consulting – Laboratory testing – Failure analysis – design Lithium battery fire statistics • There is no epidemiological data available on e-bike fire risk • There is data on electric road vehicles – This data is not useful for e-bikes • There is recent data on vaping device fires – Applicable to e-bikes because the cells are the same and are used in similar ways • Most common time for fire is during charging and discharging – This is true for almost all consumer applications – Charging is an issue for all applications – The discharge problem applies to high-current devices like e-cigs, EVs and e-bikes – Fire risks during storage and transport are specific to each application Lithium battery fire statistics How does Li-ion cell chemistry affect the risk of fire and explosion? • Cell vs battery – Cell is an individual electrochemical cell that produces a specific voltage • Lead-acid 2V • Ni-Cd 1.2V • Alkaline 1.5V • Lithium 3.5 to 4.5V – A battery is an electrical and mechanical combination of cells to produce a higher voltage or grater output current. • Cells: AA, C, D, 18650 • Battrey: 12V car battery, 9V battery, 48V e-bike battery – types of rechargeable batteries in e-bikes (and cars) • sealed lead-acid • NiCd • Lithium • Lithium itself is many different chemistries such as Li-NiMn and Li-FePO – Li-FePO is stable and does not self heat but it has a low discharge current. It is commonly used in some power tools, solar storage, and marine. – The Lithium chemistries used in e-bikes allow high discharge currents and fast charging, similar to electric car requirements. This is usually Li-NiMn or Li-MnCo chemistry – The electrolyte in these lithium chemistry batteries is a liquid hydrocarbon mixture How does Li-ion cell chemistry affect the risk of fire and explosion? • Because of the vulnerability of lithium cell design, self-heating of the cell during charge or discharge is the leading cause of fires. – more than other types of chemistry because of high energy density and high discharge current – Because the liquid electrolyte vaporizes and build pressure in the cell – high charge current is design choice – Self-heating can lead to thermal runaway, where the excessive heat itself can further damage the cell (or adjacent cells) • lithium can burn without oxygen – extinguishing is difficult – can heat adjacent cells – the electrolyte is flammable How does Li-ion cell affect the risk of fire and explosion? • Defect in a cell is the other main cause of fires • Defect creates an internal short – Can be an inclusion – Thin area in insulator – Internal short • Defects in cells can come from – cell manufacture • Hand made vs machine made • QC testing – damage during battery pack mfg – damage during transport – damage during use How does the manufacturing process of batteries and e-bikes, and the chain-of- commerce for both products affect the risk of Li- ion battery fire? • E-bikes tend to use 18650 cells in a S-P battery pack configuration to get 48V DC output • hand-made vs machine made cells – Depends on form factor – these days 18650s are machine made – QC on cells; has the cell been screened for defects? – counterfeit cells • cell maker vs batter pack mfg – Quality cells are made by Panasonic, Sony and Samsung – cell sourcing (counterfeit or untested) – thermal management – battery charge/discharge management/protection How does the manufacturing process of batteries and e-bikes, and the chain-of- commerce for both products affect the risk of Li- ion battery fire? • kit bike vs manufactured product – A complete manufactured e-bike might be tested and use approved products – A kit may contain COTS parts assembled overseas or locally – There are engineered kits that are different from COTS parts; these are often reversible kits • How is the e-bike imported? – direct by end-user can bypass many import controls and retail risk- management controls – local bike shop – larger retailer risk management requirements What are the common specific risk factors of battery fires that are potentially under the control of the end-user of the bike and battery? • Good practices in choosing a cell or battery pack – Watch out for too-good-to-be-true prices for 18650 cells or battery packs – There is almost no way to know the source when buying direct from another country and self-importing – protect cells and batteries from mechanical damage and heat • Good charging practices – do not upgrade cells in a battery pack or change charging method • For example, removing an internal battery pack and charging it externally • Using an advertised faster charger – Where to charge the battery? • charge in your fireplace What are the common specific risk factors of battery fires that are potentially under the control of the end-user of the bike and battery? • Good practices in choosing an e-bike – buy from a retail chain with legal imports and insurance protection – Avoid products with removable batteries or external battery charging – use the supplied charger with the e-bike – Watch out for kit bikes unless you know what you’re doing What can the AHJ (authority having jurisdiction) do to affect battery fire risk? • Provide and enforce designated charging stations – This can help remove auxiliary power packs, generators, solar panels, and other ad-hoc charging methods in the field – It also helps contain risk location, and the charging area can be made fire resistant • Specify certain features that e-bikes must have in order to access the mountain – non-removable battery – UL or CE or other regulatory approval marks – E-bike registration and licensing","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
