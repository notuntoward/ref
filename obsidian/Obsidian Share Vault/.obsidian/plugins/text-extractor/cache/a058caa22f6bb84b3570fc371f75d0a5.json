Pre-dispatch Overview Pre-dispatch has two major purposes: • To provide Market Participants with information about unit loading, unit ancillary service response and pricing to assist them to make informed decisions about market participation. • To assist AEMO to fulfil its power system responsibilities in accordance with the NER, in relation to system reliability and security. This information is calculated by pre-dispatch and published to the market in the form of 30- minute period schedules of forecast unit loading, forecast unit ancillary service response and forecast regional prices. Figure 1 below illustrates the pre-dispatch process in context of the inputs and outputs. The major inputs to the pre-dispatch process can be divided into two categories: • Participant Inputs o Registration data o Energy & FCAS dispatch offers/bids • AEMO Inputs o Demand forecast o FCAS requirements o Network constraints o Wind generation forecasts from AWEFS o Solar generation forecast from ASEFS The major outputs of the pre-dispatch process are split into two categories • Aggregate data o Pre-dispatch solution data o Regional data o Network data • Unit specific data o Unit energy dispatch data o Unit ancillary service dispatch data Pre-dispatch procedure AEMO | Doc Ref: SO_OP_3704 | 7 August 2023 Page 5 of 10 Each of these inputs and outputs is detailed in the sections below. Figure 1: Pre-dispatch process 2.1. Pre-dispatch timing As indicated in NER 3.8.20, AEMO must prepare and publish a pre-dispatch schedule in accordance with the spot market operations timetable. Currently AEMO runs pre-dispatch every half hour, on the half hour for each 30-minute period up to and including the last 30-minute period of the last trading day for which bid band prices have closed. As changes to bid band prices for the next trading day close at 1230 hours EST, at that time AEMO publishes pre- dispatch for all 30-minute periods up to the end of the next trading day. 3. Inputs 3.1. Participant Inputs 3.1.1. Registration data Unit registration data is standing data that is initially submitted by the Market Participant and subsequently authorised by AEMO as part of the dispatchable unit registration process for participation in energy and FCAS dispatch. 3.1.2. Energy and FCAS dispatch offers/bids Unit energy dispatch offer/bid data is the price band and MW quantity information relating to a Market Participant’s dispatchable unit(s) or load(s) submitted in accordance with NER 3.8. This data is used by pre-dispatch to forecast the MW loading for each dispatchable unit or load at the end of each 30-minute period of the pre-dispatch period. Pre-dispatch procedure AEMO | Doc Ref: SO_OP_3704 | 7 August 2023 Page 6 of 10 FCAS dispatch offer/bid data is the market ancillary service quantity, pricing and boundaries of operation information relating to a Market Participant’s dispatchable unit(s) or load(s) which is submitted in accordance with NER 3.8. This data is used by pre-dispatch to forecast the dispatch quantity of each FCAS for each dispatchable unit or load with a valid FCAS offer, for each 30-minute period of the pre-dispatch period. 3.2. AEMO inputs 3.2.1. Forecast demand In accordance with NER 4.9.1 AEMO must produce the most probable (50% probability of exceedance) energy demand for each region for each 30-minute period. These forecasts are based on half-hourly historical metering records and expected weather patterns. AEMO will regularly review the accuracy of the pre-dispatch demand forecast to ensure if reflects the actual demand trend. For details on load forecasting methodology refer to SO_OP_3710 (Load Forecasting). 3.2.2. Ancillary service requirements In accordance with NER 3.8.11 AEMO is required to enter the regional market ancillary service requirements for each FCAS for each 30-minute period. This is implemented in the form of FCAS type constraints. For details relating to calculation of FCAS requirements refer to AEMO’s Constraint Implementation Guidelines. 3.2.3. Inter-regional and intra-regional Limits Each interconnector has a defined flow direction, with positive interconnector flows out of the defined “From Region” into the “To Region” with the limits on the scheduled flow of energy over an interconnector defined for each direction. Limits on the operation of dispatchable units and interconnectors are implemented in the NEMDE algorithm using constraint equations. These constraints may represent “system normal” type limits or may be invoked for planned outages of transmission equipment as advised by the relevant NSPs. Constraints for planned outages may include both energy and FCAS requirements. For a full description on constraints refer to AEMO's Constraint Implementation Guidelines. NSPs or AEMO may also define certain intra-regional limits to control flows within a region. AEMO will use constraint equations to impose energy flow limits on intra-connectors. 3.2.4. AWEFS and ASEFS Forecasts The Australian Wind Energy Forecasting System (AWEFS) and the Australian Solar Energy Forecasting System (ASEFS) provide a forecast of available capacity, known as the unconstrained intermittent generation forecast (UIGF) for semi scheduled wind farms and solar farms respectively. They are also used to calculate the forecasts for significant non-scheduled wind and solar generation. The available capacity, or availability, used by the NEMDE process is the lower of the UIGF and Max Avail. Pre-dispatch procedure AEMO | Doc Ref: SO_OP_3704 | 7 August 2023 Page 7 of 10 3.3. SCADA The following SCADA data is captured by the NEMDE process from the NEM SCADA database and is applied to the first 30-minute period calculation only, of the current pre-dispatch schedule. • Unit data o Initial loading • Network data o Initial interconnector flow o EMS limits o Other network quantities. 4. Outputs Pre-dispatch information is released to the market in two stages: • Output results calculated from each run of the Pre-dispatch process are released after that Pre-dispatch run. Pre-dispatch data of an aggregate nature (both inputs and outputs) is published to the whole market, with data relating to a specific Market Participant only published to that participant; and • All Pre-dispatch data (both input and output) is published to the whole market after the end of the trading day to which that data applies. Details of the different data provided in each category can be found in the AEMO document, Pre-dispatch Process Description, available from the AEMO website. 4.1. Aggregate data 4.1.1. Pre-dispatch solution data Provides an indication of the status of the pre-dispatch solution, whether the solution was successful or not and whether the solution is complete. 4.1.2. Region data Provides the following information for each region for each 30-minute period within the pre- dispatch period: • Spot prices and ancillary service prices • Price sensitivities to pre-defined demand changes • Interconnector flow sensitivities to pre-defined demand changes • Forecast demand • Daily energy requirement • UIGF (semi-scheduled generating units) • Available generation (scheduled generating units and semi-scheduled generating units) • Dispatchable generation (scheduled generating units and semi-scheduled generating units) • Available load (scheduled load) Pre-dispatch procedure AEMO | Doc Ref: SO_OP_3704 | 7 August 2023 Page 8 of 10 • Dispatchable load (scheduled load) • Wholesale Demand Response – Initial MW • Wholesale Demand Response – Available • Wholesale Demand Response - Dispatched • Deficit/surplus generation • Net interchange • FCAS dispatch • FCAS local dispatch • FCAS global and local requirements 4.1.3. Network data Provides the following information for each 30-minute period within the pre-dispatch period: • Interconnector initial metered flow (MW) • Interconnector target flow (MW) • Interconnector flow export and import limits (MW) • Constraint setting the interconnector flow export and import limits • Interconnector flow losses (MW) • Interconnector flow marginal loss factor • Intra-regional network flow limit (MW) • Intra-regional network flow limit status • Constraint marginal value ($/MW) • Constraint violation degree (MW) 4.2. Unit Specific data For each dispatchable unit or load the following information is provided for each 30-minute period within the pre-dispatch period: • Initial metered loading (MW) • Initial AGC status • Energy market availability (MW) • Energy market target (MW) • Energy market ramp rate (MW/minute) • UIGF (semi-scheduled generating units) • Semi Dispatch Cap flag (semi-scheduled generating units only) • FCAS raise response enabled (MW) (for each service) • FCAS lower response (enabled MW) (for each service) • FCAS availability (MW) • FCAS available/trapped/stranded flags (for each service) Pre-dispatch procedure AEMO | Doc Ref: SO_OP_3704 | 7 August 2023 Page 9 of 10 5. Management of Pre-dispatch AEMO will review the results of pre-dispatch on a regular basis to ensure the accuracy and validity of the results. Accuracy and validity may be affected by a number of issues as described in the following sections. 5.1. Demand forecast accuracy Demand forecast accuracy is highly dependent on weather forecast accuracy and customer behaviour. AEMO will regularly review the accuracy of regional demand forecasts to ensure they reflect the actual demand trend. If the forecast error for a region is greater than a threshold limit for greater than two 30-minute periods AEMO may submit a revised forecast for that region. 5.2. AWEFS and ASEFS forecast accuracy AWEFS and ASEFS forecast wind and solar generation based on weather information and real time data. Plant availability and down regulation of intermittent generation may affect the accuracy of wind and solar generation forecasts. AEMO will monitor AWEFS and ASEFS forecasts to ensure acceptable levels of accuracy are maintained. 5.3. Constraint formulation The formulation used for the pre-dispatch calculation may differ from the dispatch formulation due to the number of assumptions that may need to be made relating to future system conditions. This may result in pre-dispatch having a dissimilar outcome to dispatch. AEMO has a process in place to improve the pre-dispatch formulation of constraints where significant errors are observed. 5.4. Short notice outages NSPs may submit short notice outages that require AEMO to apply a constraint at any time during the pre-dispatch or dispatch period. NSPs may also cancel planned outages at short notice. AEMO will invoke/revoke any relevant constraints as soon as is practicable after AEMO receives notification of a new or cancelled outage. 5.5. Unplanned outages Generating units or network elements may fail at any time. The impact this may have on pre- dispatch is related to the size of the generating unit or location of the network element. AEMO will invoke any necessary constraints as soon as is practicable after AEMO is aware of the outage. 5.6. Rebidding Rebidding by Market Participants may have a significant impact on the accuracy of pre- dispatch. AEMO has no control over the level of rebidding.
