INTRODUCTION One of the major challenges in the deregulated power industry is predicting the occurrence of price-spikes in the electricity market. The complexities and uncertainties associ- ated with the grid operation cause the electricity prices to be highly volatile and often lead to abnormal price-spikes. Price- spikes can be several times the normal price and cause serious economic implications to both the suppliers and consumers. An accurate price-spike forecast enables the market partici- pants to bid competitively in the market and minimize loss of revenue. Even a small improvement in price-spike prediction is economically beneﬁcial to the market participants. Price- spike forecast can also help the market operators to enhance the market operations. In an ideal market, price spikes will occur when demand is more than supply. However, price- spikes can also occur due to market power and gaming exer- cised by market participants [1]. Generation and transmission constraints, contingencies and inaccurate load forecasting can lead to price-spikes as well. A considerable amount of research work has been done in electricity price forecasting using time series and artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms like time series auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) [2]–[4], generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) [5], ar- tiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) [6]-[8] and support vector machines (SVM) [9]-[10]. But only limited work has been done in electricity price-spike forecasting. [11] shows the use of intelligent data mining techniques in solving power system problems. In [12]–[15], modern data mining methods have been utilized to forecast price-spikes in the electricity markets. In [12], the authors provide a framework for price-spike forecasting using wavelet decomposition based neural network time series forecasting module using only indices formulated by system reserve and demand. In [13], the authors have presented a novel approach to combine price-spike forecasting and decision making using Bayesian classiﬁer approach with beneﬁt maximization. In [14], SVM and Na¨ıve-Bayes classiﬁer (NBC) is used in the framework for price-spike forecasting. In [15], a classiﬁcation-based spike prediction framework has been proposed where both normal prices and spike prices are forecasted using SVM. In this paper, a novel price-spike prediction framework is proposed that uses smart meter data in conjunction with market data to predict the occurrence of price-spikes. With the advent of smart grids, smart meters are being installed at different nodes in the power system network. The main objective of this paper is to improve the classiﬁcation and forecasting accuracy of the price-spike events by including meter data along with market data using modern data mining tools. The meter data uses the spatial information of the demand requirement at different geographic locations of the network in the price-spike classiﬁcation algorithm which otherwise remain unused. In this research, the 2011-2014 Australian Electricity Mar- ket Operator (AEMO) data is used to train and test the proposed prediction framework. Aggregated half hour energy for ﬁve meter installation sites in Victoria along with the market data of the Victorian region is used in the implemen- tation. NBC and random forest (RF) are used for price-spike classiﬁcation. II. PRICE FORECASTING IN SMART GRID INFRASTRUCTURE A. Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO) data The AEMO National Electricity Market interconnects the ﬁve regional market jurisdictions of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In this paper, half hour interval market data [16]–[17] of the Victorian region is concomitantly used with aggregated half hour energy readings for ﬁve meter installation sites in Victorian region [18] for training and testing the proposed methodology. The market data used for this purpose consists of half hour interval data including Regional Reference Price (RRP) in $/MWh, the target demand in MW, the metered demand in MW, the available generation in MW and the reserve/surplus generation in MW. Historical data from 2011-2014 has been used in 978-1-5090-5167-0/16/$31.00 ©2016 IEEE this research paper for training and testing the proposed methodology. In this paper, we use the market clearing price for energy of the AEMO and not the locational marginal price (LMP). B. Inclusion of meter data in the price-spike prediction With the world-wide boom in smart metering technologies, large amounts of meter data are available. One of the main objectives of this paper is to assimilate market data with meter data and show that the inclusion of meter data can substantially improve the price-spike forecasting in the electric power market. The meter data used for validating this includes half-hour MWh energy consumption collected from the ﬁve distribution network meter installations in Victorian region. III. PRICE-SPIKE FORECASTING ARCHITECTURE The overall algorithm consists of two parts: price-spike classiﬁcation and price-spike quantiﬁcation. In Fig. 1, the Selected feature set NBC / RF Classifier Modified feature set (Original + Classifier results) Classifier output ANN forecaster Forecasted electricity price Data pre- processing Market data Meter data Fig. 1: Price-spike forecasting architecture ﬂow chart for this algorithm is provided. The market and the meter data are pre-processed to obtain the features/indices. The classiﬁer model is then trained with the selected features obtained after data pre-processing. The forecasting model on the other hand has one additional feature – a binary parameter that categorizes a price-spike event from a non-price-spike event. In this paper, we have focused only on the price–spike classiﬁcation and not the quantiﬁcation. A. Price-spike detection in the data Jan 01, 2013 Jan 15, 2013 Jan 29, 2013 Feb 12, 2013 Feb 26, 2013 Mar 12, 2013 Mar 26, 2013Electricity price ($/MWh) 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 Jan'2013 - Mar'2013: Victorian Electricity Market Clearing Price Electricity Pool Price Pt Fig. 2: Electricity price-spike identiﬁcation using threshold limit Price-spikes have been detected through various methods in the literature. In [12], the different classes for abnormal prices are discussed. In this paper, price-spikes are detected using a threshold Pt as deﬁned in (1). Pt >μ +2σ (1) In (1), μ is the mean of the price over the training data set and σ is the standard deviation on the price for the training data set. So, any price above Pt is considered as a price-spike event. In this paper, only positive price-spikes are considered in the price-spike classiﬁcation. Fig. 2 shows the electricity price data from Jan, 2013 till March, 2013. The price threshold Pt is also plotted in the same ﬁgure. It can be observed that there are only four occurrences of spikes in the three month period. From 2011 – 2013 training data, there are 58 spikes out of 43919 data samples, hence the probability of occurrence of a spike is as low as 0.13%. So, the classiﬁcation of price- spikes becomes a challenging task, owing to the limited price- spike data availability. Inclusion of meter data can overcome this constraint to a certain extent, by improving the prediction accuracy. B. Data pre-processing and feature selection A set of features are selected for the price-spike classiﬁ- cation based on initial data analysis performed on the data available. Critical features that have signiﬁcant impact on the prediction are identiﬁed and transformed into a set of indices as shown in Table I. These indices are created to provide normalized features for the classiﬁcation and forecasting al- gorithms. • Time of day index: to incorporate the effect of daily load changes. • Month index: to identify the speciﬁc month of operation. • Weekday index: to distinguish a weekday from a week- end. • Season index: to incorporate the seasonal effect in load proﬁle and supply. • Reserve index: to incorporate the effect of system reserve. • Demand index: to incorporate the effect of system de- mand. • Change in reserve index: change in reserve from previous time interval. • Change in demand index: change in demand from previ- ous time interval. • Previous time interval spike index: occurrence of spikes in previous time interval. • Meter indices: meter readings from 5 distribution net- works in the Victorian region. TABLE I: List of selected features Time of day index Demand index Weekday index Change in reserve index Month index Change in demand index Season index Previous time interval spike index Reserve index Meter indices (5 installations) The demand index used in this paper is formulated as shown in (2), where demandi is the target demand in MW for the 978-1-5090-5167-0/16/$31.00 ©2016 IEEE ith time interval and base demand for a particular day is the initial demand at the start of the day. demand indexi = demandi base demand (2) The reserve index is formulated as shown in (3), where supplyi is the available generation in MW for the ith time interval. reserve indexi = supplyi − demandi supplyi (3) Demand index 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1Electricity price ($/MWh) 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 Jan'2013 - Mar'2013 - Victorian Market data Fig. 3: Electricity price vs. demand index Reserve index 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7Electricity price ($/MWh) 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 Jan'13 to April'13 - Victorian market data Fig. 4: Electricity price vs. reserve index Fig. 3 shows the scatter plot of the electricity price and demand index for the Victorian market data from Jan, 2013– Mar, 2013. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that price-spikes are located towards high demand index values, since, price-spikes are more likely to occur when the system is stressed due to high demand. Low system reserve can also trigger price-spikes as is evident from Fig. 4. When the system lacks sufﬁcient reserve, expensive units are cleared in the market leading to high prices. The meter index (MI) is formulated as shown in (4), where meterk i−1 is the meter reading of the kth meter in MWh for the (i − 1)th time interval. Hence, the previous time interval meter readings are used in estimating the MI for the ith interval. These meter indices provide spatial information of demand distribution over the geography of the region under study. This is possible because the power ﬂow information between different zones in a region is masked within the meter indices. Thereby, the meter indices also act as an indicator for transmission congestion. Hence, the meter data information (meter index) is an important feature in the price spike prediction model. Five different meter indices are used in this paper based on the ﬁve different meter data of the ﬁve distribution networks in the Victorian region. Now, the accuracy of the prediction will depend on the location of the meters, since the selected feature - meter indices will contain the spatial information of the demand requirement over the geography of the network. meter indexk i = meterk i−1 5∑ k=1 meterk i−1 (4) In Fig. 5, the scatter diagram for the electricity prices vs. the MI of one of the ﬁve distribution networks is plotted. It can be observed from the ﬁgure that the price spikes occur between the 0.1-0.11 MI range. This indicates that price-spikes are more likely to occur in that particular MI range for the given meter site. Similarly it has been observed that the price spikes tend to occur at a speciﬁc range of MI values for other meter installation sites as well. Thereby, the characteristic MI range can be used to uniquely identify the speciﬁc sites within the region.

Price-spike quantiﬁcation Once the price-spikes have been classiﬁed, a new feature is added to the list of selected features for performing the electricity price quantiﬁcation. This is a binary vector con- sisting of the predicted classes depicting the occurrence of price-spikes in that particular time interval. This module has not been considered in this paper. IV. RESULTS The algorithms are implemented using the R–project [19], a software environment for statistical computing. The ‘e1071’ [20] and the ‘randomForest’ [21] packages available in the CRAN repository are used for implementing the NBC and RF algorithms respectively. The ‘nnet’ package [22] is used implement price value forecasting using feed-forward single layered neural network model. 978-1-5090-5167-0/16/$31.00 ©2016 IEEE A. Price-spike classiﬁcation results 1) Na¨ıve-Bayes classiﬁer results: In Fig. 6, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves [true positive rate (TPR) vs. false positive rate (FPR)] are plotted for the Na¨ıve-Bayes classiﬁer for two cases: • Case 1: using only market data, • Case 2: using composite market and meter data. Fig. 6: NBC ROC curve Fig. 7: NBC confusion matrix (both market & meter data) Fig. 8: NBC confusion matrix (only market data) For a perfect classiﬁer, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) should be 1. In Fig. 6, the value of AUC in Case 2 is higher than in Case 1. There is an improvement of approx. 0.5% in the AUC value and this improvement in forecast can have signiﬁcant economic beneﬁt to the market participants. Hence, it can be inferred that inclusion of meter data can improve price-spike forecasting accuracy. The confusion matrices for both the cases are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. From the confusion matrices it can be observed that inclusion of meter data in the NBC improves the prediction with lower false negatives (FN). 2) Random forest classiﬁer results: The ROC curve and the confusion matrix for the random forest classiﬁer using market and meter data are presented in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 respectively. The NBC predicts higher false positives (FP) when compared to RFC, but this cannot harm the system as it advises to improve caution in the market and there will be no heavy economical loss incurred. Whereas, the RF classiﬁer predicts higher FNs when compared to NBC. More number of FNs indicates the inability to predict an actual price spike; this can result in serious economic implications and is hence undesirable. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the NBC is a more suitable classiﬁer for the selected data and problem. Fig. 9: RF classiﬁer ROC curve Fig. 10: RF classiﬁer confusion matrix 3) Importance vector for the selected features: The trained RF classiﬁer model enumerates an importance vector for the feature sets used in training the classiﬁer model. From RF feature importance matrix as shown in Fig. 11, it can be seen that meter indices have a signiﬁcant impact on the price-spike classiﬁcation accuracy. From Fig. 11, it can be seen that meter indices have more importance than the time of day, weekday, month and seasonal indices and similar importance to change in demand, change in reserve and previous time interval spike indices. The ﬁgure also shows the demand and reserve indices have the highest predictor signiﬁcance. V. CONCLUSION The main objective of this paper is to improve the accuracy of price-spike classiﬁcation with the inclusion of meter data 978-1-5090-5167-0/16/$31.00 ©2016 IEEE Fig. 11: RF classiﬁer importance vector with the market data. It can be noted that in the span of 4 years, the number of spikes detected is fairly low. From the 2011– 2013 training data, 58 instances of price-spikes are observed out of 43919 data samples, but once a price-spike occurs, it can result in severe economic consequences for the market participants. The ability to predict and forecast the price-spike gives the market participants the upper hand to bid strategically in the market. Considering the stochastic nature of the price- spikes that have occurred over the years, the accuracy of the price-spike prediction has improved by approx. 0.5% after the inclusion of the meter data, which can signiﬁcantly relax the economic burden on market participants.
