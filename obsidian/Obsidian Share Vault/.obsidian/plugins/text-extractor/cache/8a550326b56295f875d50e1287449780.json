A multidimensional analogue of Schoenberg's Spline Approximation Method is presented within a Computer- Aided Design context. The construction uses multivariate B- splines to approximate real valued functions on arbitrary poly- hedrons in Euclidean spaces of any dimension. 1. Introduction. Univariate ^-spline approximation techniques have enjoyed an immense popularity as a tool in the field of Computer-Aided Geometric Design (CAGD). Most applications utilize the Spline Approxi- mation Method of Schoenberg and Greville [15] in which given a sequence of knot points t0 < • • • < tN+k+i and a real valued function /defined on [t0, tN+k+i\\ the approximation to/i s defined by (1.1) Jilf\\ x) = g/(*/,-) N(x: /,., ... , ti+k+1). In this expression the u{ = (r,-+1 + • • • + ti+k)/k are called the nodes and the N(x: t{, ... , tt+k+1) are the normalized ^-spline basis functions de- fined on the knots *,-, ... , ti+k+i of degree k. In CAGD the coefficients f{ut) are frequently supplied a priori and are the \"graphical handles\" used to interact with a design. Within this context the function/is chosen to be a piece-wise linear function parametrized so that the coefficients are the breakpoints at the nodes (see Figure 1.1). This approximation method possesses a number of properties which make it particularly attractive for use in CAGD. First, the method is a local one in that for any evaluation there are at most m nonzero basis functions meaning that small perturbations to the function / result in localized changes to Jtk(f). A second important feature of this scheme is that the basis functions form a partition of unity which has the desirable consequences that the approximation lies within the convex hull of the coefficients of each basis function as well as invariance under rigid motion transformations. The last feature (1.1) possesses is that the approximation oscillates no more than the function/itself. Note, in particular, that this constrains Jtk(J) to reproduce linear functions and in fact the choice of nodes in (1.1) was made so that it would do just that.

Extensions to higher dimensions have usually involved tensor products of univariate methods and have generally shown only limited promise. Given knot sequences s0 < • • • < sN+p+l and t0 < • • • < t M+g+h and a real valued function / defined on [s0, sN+p+1] x (70, tM+q+1] a bivariate analogue of (1.1) would be N M Jtpjj\\ *) = 2] Z! /fa , uj) (1.2) '* =0'=° x Nfa: si9 ... , st.+p+1) N(x2: th ... , tnq+1) where w,- and vy are the nodes and N{x\\\\ sh ... , ^/+^-i_i) and N(x2: tj, ... , ^y+9+i) are the pth and ^th degree univariate 2?-spline basis functions. As in the one dimensional case the function / is usually chosen to be piece-wise linear with predefined breakpoints occuring at the nodes. The approximation method given by (1.2) and similar higher dimension- al analogues have most of the desirable features of the univariate schemes; specifically local behavior, positive basis functions summing to one, and some shape preserving qualities in that they reproduce linear functions. Unfortunately tensor product schemes also possess some severe limita- tions with perhaps their most restrictive shortcoming being their depen- dency on rectilinear knot distributions. A knot topology of this configuration does not easily lend itself to modelling a wide variety of objects as can be seen, for example, in Figure 1.2 which depicts the wing-body fairing of an airplane. The region where the leading edge of the wing joins the fuselage cannot be satisfactorily modelled unless some special construction is attempted there such as coalescing knot points or substituting some non-i?-spline surface. Either AN APPLICATION OF MULTIVARIATE 5-SPLINES 161 FIGURE 1.2. A surface not easily modelled by tensor product J5-splines. attempt, aside from the added complexity of the construction, has a ten- dency to circumvent the desirable qualities which prompted the use of jB-splines initially. What is truly needed therefore is an alternate general- ization of (1.1) that admits arbitrary knot configurations while still pre- serving its desirable features. The purpose of this paper is to describe such a generalization which uses multivariate ^-splines that can be defined for almost any knot configuration giving approximations on any compact polyhedral region in a Euclidean space of any dimension. The following introduces some notation and terminology that will be used throughout the paper. Elements of R w will be of the form x and will always be assumed to be column vectors. Superscripts will always denote indices for elements of R n and subscripts will in general give the compon- ent of a particular vector so that x p q references the #th-component of the /?th-element from a collection of vectors. The point eg will equal (dip, <?2/» • • • > öqPy for q in Z + and Sq will be the set of all such eg with/? varying between zero and q. Notation of the form z = (x, y) f with x in R w and y in R* will refer to a column vector in R w+A? in which the first n components of z are x and the last/:arey. Similarly (x1 • • • x s) and ( , ) \\yl . . . ys) would be n x s and (n + k) x s matrices respectively. If P is a collection of vectors then [P] will denote the convex hull of P and if /°, ... , t n is a set of points in R w then S equal to [t°, ... , t n] will be referred to as an 162 P. KOCHEVAR «-simplex which has the points t°, ... , t n as its vertices. The following notations are equivalent vol(S) = vol(r°, ...,*» ) = 1 .. . 1 t° ... t» all equaling n ! times the signed volume of S. The integer n will always denote the dimension of the space in which an approximation is to take place, k will denote the degree of the multi- variate 5-splines used in the approximation, and m will always equal n + k. The map &> will be defined to be the orthogonal projection of Rw onto R w. 2. Multivariate B-splines. The following geometric definition of multi- variate i?-splines appeared in DeBoor [7] and will prove invaluable in the approximation constructions that are to follow. Suppose JT is any knotset having m + 1 knots in R n and S is a proper simplex in R w whose vertices project orthogonally onto the knots in JT. The unnormalized «th-variate ^-spline of degree k is defined by (2.1) M(X:JT) = (Xs(x) J Volume(S) m = n, jVolume({y e S: 0>{y) = x}) / Volume(S) m > n where Xs is the characteristic function on S. As an example suppose M(x: 0, 1,2, 3) is to be calculated for some x0 in the interval [1, 2]. Lift 0, 1, 2, and 3 to R3 by choosing s° = (0, 1, 0)', s 1 = (1, 0, 0)', s 2 = (2, 0, 1)', and s3 = (3, 1, 0)' then M(x0: 0, 1,2, 3) just equals A/V where A is the area of the intersection of the plane x = x0 with the simplex S = 2 1 s° FIGURE 2.1. Geometric construction of M(x: 0, 1, 2, 3). AN APPLICATION OF MULTIVARIATE i?-SPLINES 163 |>°, s 1, s 2, s 3] and V is the volume of S. Figure 2.1 illustrates the construc- tion. Although this geometric definition is quite nice conceptually it is hor- rendous computationally. Fortunately, a recursive definition was dis- covered independently by both Micchelli [12] and Dahmen [5]: Given a knotset X in R M of cardinality m + 1 and a point x contained in the pro- per simplex 0°, ... , t n] with vertices in JT then [JSr^W/VolumeÖJf]) m = n (2.2) M(x: X) = LJQ £ ^ (x ) M(JC: JT - {/<}) m > n where £,(*) is the barycentric coordinate function on X equal to vol(f°, ... , f«- 1, x, /'+1, ... , /»)/vol(/°, ... , f w). A proper simplex can always be found so that it contains x except in the case where all the knots in c/f lie in a hyperplane of dimension less than n. In this degenerate case M(x: jf ) will be artificially set to zero. The only time a term with a degenerate 5-spline could possibly make a con- tribution in the recurrence relation (2.2) would be when x lies in the knot- set over which the 2?-spline is defined. However, then the barycentric co- ordinate function associated with the J5-spline would be zero annihilating the term. It can be shown in general that the effect a degenerate knotset has on the definition of a ^-spline is to reduce its continuity across the degeneracy. Micchelli [13] provides a more detailed discussion on using the recurrence relation (2.2) for calculating i?-splines on arbitrary knotsets. As an example, suppose t° = (0, 0)', t 1 = (2, 0)>, t 2 = (1, 1)', and *3 = (o, 2)' then for x in [t°, t\\ t 2, t 3] M(x: /o, t\\ t 2, t 3) = 3(b0(x)M(x: t\\ t 2, t 3) + bx(x) M(x: t°, t 2, t 3) + b2(x)M(x: *°, t\\ t 3)). In the above, M(x: t l, f 2, /3) is a degenerate ^-spline so that its value strictly by expression (2.2) is infinite for any x lying on the line segment from t l to t 3 but at the same time its coefficient there is zero, signifying that the first term makes no contribution to the sum. Visually the effect of the degeneracy on M(x: t°, t 1, t 2, t 3) is to introduce a discontinuity across the line segment from t 1 and t 3 as depicted in Figure 2.2. Figures 2.3 and 2.4 show the graphs of two additional bivariate i5-spline basis functions along with their associated knotsets. 3. Multivariate B-spline approximation on [SJ. For any degree k let E be the set of knots in R w which consists of the elements of Sn each re- plicated k + 1 times, that is, (3.1) 164 P. KOCHEVAR 7 FIGURE 2.2.

AN APPLICATION OF MULTIVARIATE iS-SPLINES 165 and let S be a collection of knotesets contained in E each having cardi- nality m + 1 where m = n + k. Given a real valued function / defined on [Sn] a kth degree approximation will be constructed having the form (3.2) JlnMf- *) = 2 A«*) N(x: Jt) where N(x: JT) is a normalized multivariate 2?-spline basis function defined on the knotset j f (which differs from (2.2) by a constant to be defined subsequently) and where u* in R n is a node which depends on the knots in jf. To define (3.2) fully a procedure to construct the collection of knotsets, S and a means of determining the nodes must both be established. These constructions will be motivated by the features of the univariate approxi- mation scheme (1.1) which are responsible for most of its desirable char- acteristics. Specifically, for x contained in [Sn], S and the u* will be defined so that (3.3) Z N(x: jt) = 1 and 2 u*N(x: jf) = x JTŒS JTŒS or in other words chosen so that Jj/ntk(E, f) reproduces linear functions. Establishing the knotsets. In [7] deBoor suggests a way to establish such a partition of unity on [U] for some set of knots U in R w. His idea was to select some suitable convex set C in R* having unit volume to form the set [U] x C, then lift each knot in U to [U] x C by appending to it a vector in R*, and finally triangulating the lifted knots to form a 166 P. KOCHEVAR collection o f ra-simplices, ZT, such that the union o f all simplices in &\" is precisely [U] x C an d th e intersection o f an y tw o is either empty o r consists o f a common face having dimension less than m.

Using this idea fo r the problem a t hand, take C = [Sk] with the se t o f knots U = E then [U] x C = [Sn] x [Sk], If 3T is a proper triangulation of [Sn] x [Sk] then fo r any x in [S J jfc!

AN APPLICATION OF MULTIVARIATE 5-SPLINES 167 If Perm is the group of permutations on the integers one through m then for any p in Perw as m-simplex, Sp, equal to [vj, ... , v£] can be defined by setting v°p = Oand v { p = vj\"1 + e%\\ The collection {Sp: p e Perw} is defined as Kuhn's triangulation of the hypercube [0, l]m. By appropriately mapping [Sn] x [Sk] to [0, \\] m with some function F, one can take as the triangulation of [Sn] x [Sk] the collection of simplices {F\"\"1^): Se<%} where <fy is the set of simplices in the triangulation of F([Sn] x [5J) induced by Kuhn's triangulation. Define 4 = (1, 1, ... , 1, 0, 0, .. . 0)' to be a vector in R m in which the first i components are one and the remaining m — i components are zero and let Um = {e*m: 0 ^ / ^ m). Let / be a set of multi-indices in Z | of the form OW2) with 0 ^ j\\ ^ n and 0 ^ y2 ^ *• F ° r anyy in /define (3.6) tf> = (e£ 40 ' and 6' = {e{1 42)' and let F be the function from Sn x 5^ onto £/„ x Uk which maps ^ to bK The set £/„ x Uk is a subset of the set of vertices of the hypercube [0, l] w and therefore Kuhn's triangulation induces a triangulation on [Un] x [Uk]. Since ej. can never have a component of zero preceding a component of one for any nonnegative / less than r, the subset of Perw which leads to a triangulation of [Un] x [Uk] is just the set P equal to (3.7) {p e Perw:/?_1(0 < />-1W when 1 g 1 < r ^ n or « + 1 ^ 1 < r ^ m}. Define a function G^ from S, = [vj, .. . , v^\\ to [F-^vJ), ... , ^ _1(vp] for each /? in P such that W = g *,<*) F-i(vp, the bt(x) being the barycentric coordinate functions on Sp, and define G so that G(x) = Gp(x) when x is in Sp. The collection of simplices &\" = {G(5^): /?eP } then triangulates [Sn] x [SJ and a collection of knotsets which results in a partition of unity on [Sn] is just the collection of all orthogonal projections of the vertices of each simplex in &~. Calculation of the nodes. In [11] Marsden and Schoenberg state a uni- variate 5-spline identity which they later use to find the nodes for the approximation scheme (1.1). This identity states that if z is any real number and t° < • • • < t N are any knots in R then (3.8) (z - x)*»- 1 = 7j (z - f+i) .. . (z - v+*»- l)N{x: t', .. . , f'+») for any * in [/m - 1, r^~ w+1]. By expanding both sides into powers of z and setting like terms equal then 2£ o u*N(x: t\\ ... , /'+,w) = x where w' = (/*+i + .. . + /»+«-i)/(/W - l). It will be shown that by exploiting this 168 P. KOGHEVAR strategy in a multidimensional setting the nodes u x of the approximation (3.3) can be calculated so that they reproduce linear functions on [Sn]. Let T be any set of knots in R w (for the construction to follow T need not be restricted to elements of Sn) and suppose each knot tinT has been lifted to R m by appending an element of Sk. If U is the set of all such lifted knots with the volume of [U] greater than zero, then for i from one to n define (3.9) Ut = .(* - U) a G U > for any z > max(f,-) in R. al *er Suppose further that [U] has been triangulated into a collection of m- simplices £T. For each S in 3T define S, = e S LI\\( z — ti) al \\ a) and let ZT{ = {S{\\ Se^r}. Again, recalling the geometric expression (2.1), k\\ S Volume({j e St: 0>(y) = JC}) = (kl/ml) Z vol(^) M(x: 0>(St)) = (z - *,)*. Figure 3.2 ilustrates this construction in the linear univeriate case.

AN APPLICATION OF MULTIVARIATE 2?-SPLINES 169 Note that 0>(St) = 0tß) for all S{ so that M(x: 0Hßt)) = M(x: 0ÌS)) and since M(x: 0>(S)) = ml N(x: 0>(S))/(k\\ vol(S)) the expression finally gives rise to the identity (3.11) 2 vol(SV)/vol(S) N(x: &(S)) = (z - *,)*. Let 5 be the collection of knotsets determined by the projections of the vertices of each simplex S in ST. Suppose J T is the knotset in S consisting of the knots /°, ... , t m which are the orthogonal projections of the vertices of the simplex S so that / t° t™ \\ VOÌ(Si) = V\\z-tVaO-'\\z-tT)a»>ì each a* being an element of Sk.

The right side of (3.11) expands to the form (z — xt) k = z k — k xt- zk-i + 0(z k~ 2) and on equating like powers of z in the expression (3.12), uf, the ith node component, equals 1 / (k vol(S)) 2 voi(BV, . -., Bf) where i varies between one and w. 4. Approximation on arbitrary polyhedrons. The special approximation J?„tk(E, f) given by (3.2) was shown in [9] to be nothing more than a reformulation of the Generalized Bezier Approximation to real valued functions defined on [Sn]. In this section Jjf„tk(E, f) will be extended to a general scheme defined on arbitrary polyhedrons by relying on two interconnected constructions. One construction is that of knot refinement where new knots are added to some initial set in such a way as to extend the original approximation to a new one defined on the larger set. Un- fortunately when the initial set of knots is just the vertices of [Sn] any refinement will extend to an approximation which may not have the maximum attainable continuity. In this case not every set of n + 1 knots in some knotset will be of dimension n which by a result of Micchelli [13, p. 14] means that the degree of continuity of the basis function defined on that knotset may be less than k — 1. Although some applica- tions in CAGD could capitalize on these discontinuities to form creases in a design surface (e.g., the trailing edge of an airplane wing) a means will be developed which can guarantee the maximum degree of continuity. 170 P. KOCHEVAR This process will turn out to be nothing more than a multidimensional analogue of the end conditions that must be specified in ordinary uni- variate 2?-spline approximation. Boundary conditions. Each knot in the initial set E defined by (3.1) will be termed an \"exterior\" knot while any appended to E through knot refinement will be termed an \"interior\" knot. If the exterior knots can be displaced appropriately before knot insertion occurs then the continuity class of the resulting approximation can be improved. In [5] Dahmen performs such an alteration by lifting each knot to Rw, applying a certain affine transformation to them, and finally projecting them back to R w. The goal in what follows is to also construct an affine transformation which will move the knots in E into general positions while at the same time preserving the partition of unity on [Sn]. Following Dahmen, define a transformation, srf, acting on any u in R m to equal /•• \" \\ (4.1) • m diag^ , ... , d H9 1, ... , 1)0\" + (v, 0)< where A = (a{j) is some arbitrary n x k \"boundary condition\" matrix, diagw(x) is an m x m diagonal matrix having x as the diagonal, and v is an element of R w. Note that $0 is the product of skew and a scale trans- formation followed by a translation. Define Ut to be the set Sn x {e*k} and let V{ be the collection {^(j/(w)) : u e U{} with i varying between zero and k. Each [Vt] is a simplex in R n which is just a scaled translate of [Sn] and therefore there exists a natural correspondence between the vertices in Sn and those in each V{. Let U be the intersection of all [V^ and note that U can either be empty, ay-simplex where j < n, or a scaled translate of [Sn] which equals the set W = {x e R». k\\ Volume({.y e j/([SJ x [Sk]): 0>(y) = x}) = 1}. Assuming for simplicity that dx = • • • = dn = d9 the scale factor d and a translate v will need to be determined for the transformation sé so that U equals [Sn]. Let { 0 if i = 0 be the point in each set V t - which corresponds to the origin in Sn. Suppose U is a scaled translate of [Sn] and V is the set of vertices of the simplex U, then the point c, where AN APPLICATION OF MULTIVARIATE 5-SPLINES 171 cj = max(c}) = max{0, aJh ... , aJk}9 1 ^j^n9 is the point in V which corresponds to the origin in Sn (see Figure 4.1). In [9] it was demonstrated that the translate v in (4.1) must equal - c and the scale factor d must be 1 + V! 4- • • • vw - min{c( + • • • + 4} - <cj,cj 4 <J) <o,d) r v (0,0) <C* 4 d,C* ) FIGURE 4.1. Displacement of the exterior knots. If &~ is the collection of simplices which triangulate [Sn] x [Sk] then ^r* = {^/(S): Se&~} triangulates s/([Sn] x [Sk]) and thus determines a collection of knotsets which are the projections of the vertices of each simplex in &\"*. Fo r any x in the simplex [Sn] Jfc! £ Volume^eS* : 0>(y) = x}) = (jfc!/#w!) 2 vol(S*)M(;c: 0tS*)) = vol(^) = 1 S*ET * which suggests that each basis function be normalized by setting N(x: 0>(S*)) = (k\\/ml)vo\\(S*)M(x: 0>(S*)). In addition, for any simplex 5 * a node 14 s* can be determined by the node calculation procedure outlined earlier. Thus a new approximation to real valued functions/defined on the convex hull of T* equal to [0>{œ?{Sn x Sk))] is (4.2) JtUT\\f: x) = 2 /(W 5*)M*: ^(5*)) having the property that for any x in [Sn] linear functions are reproduced. 172 P. KOCHEVAR Knot refinement. The final construction required before fully defining the general approximation on arbitrary polyhedrons is an iterative procedure for refining the approximation Jf„}k(T*,f). Suppose Tis a set of knots either equalling T* or containing T* as well as a finite number of additional knots lying in [Sn]. Suppose further that K is a collection of knotsets in T so that Jfn,k(T9f) is a refined approximation derived from Jtnik(T*, f) having the property that it reproduces all linear functions in [Sn]. Given any y in [Sn] the iterative step which extends Jin>k{T,f) to an approximation on the set of knots T [j {y} will now be outlined. A theorem due to Micchelli [13] states that if y = 2*=^ btt, bt in R, for some knotset jf in K then (4.3) M(x: X) = 2 btM(x: (JT - {/}) U {y}\\ For each X in the collection U = {JT e K: y e [jf ]}, a set of knots, t°, .. ., t n can be chosen which lie on the boundary of [JT] such that y is in the «-simplex, S, composed of those knots. If the volume of [S] is greater than zero then y = £?=o b^y)^ and relation (4.3) becomes (4.4) N(x: J O = cx | j btiy)M(x: Jf 0 where jf' = (JT U {y}) — {t*}, cx is the normalization constant such that N(x: jf ) equals c#M(x\\ JT), and the bt(x) are the barycentric coor- dinate functions on S. Note that by choosing only simplices whose vertices lie on the boundary of [JT] it is guaranteed no other knots in the set T — X lie in the interior of [JT*] provided this was the case for all JT in K initially. It will turn out in general that not all knotsets v in the collection V = {jf ' : 0 ^ / ^ n, J T G U} are distinct. To rectify this situation let W be the collection of all distinct knotsets in V and for all pt in W define (4.5) N(x: u) = 2 cvbvM(x: ju) VŒV where cv are normalization constants and bv are barycentric coordinate functions evaluated at y corresponding to a knotset jf* in the expression (4.4). For all x in [V] the refined approximation defined on T [} {y} is then given by (4.6) Jtn,k(J U {y},f: x) = L f(u*)N(x: JT) + £ f(u?)N(x: ft) with the property that the basis functions form a partition of unity. All that remains to fully specify the scheme (4.6) is to calculate the new nodes ut* so that AN APPLICATION OF MULTIVARIATE ^-SPLINES 173 £ u*N(x: jf) + £ ufN(x: p) = x. For any /i in W, relations (4.4) an d (4.5) signify that th e node w* must satisfy th e expression (4.7 ) w N(x: fi) = uf( £ CJ)V\\M(X: /LL) = / 2 ] u vc vb v\\M(X: JX) where u v is the old node associated with the basis function defined on the knotset v in (4.4). Solving fo r uv in (4.7) UV = 2 UvcJ>J Z J C A and since cvbv > 0 fo r all v, uv is a convex combination o f old nodes which insures that th e new nodes lie in [T]. Approximation on polyhedrons. A polyhedron in R \" is a region which can b e partitioned into a finite collection of proper «-simplices in which the intersection o f any two is either empty o r is a common face having dimension less than n.
