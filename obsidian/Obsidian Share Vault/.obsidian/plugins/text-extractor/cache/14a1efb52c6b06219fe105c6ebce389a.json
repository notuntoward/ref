Thesis The Faculty of Electrical Engineering / Computer Science University of Kassel M.Sc. Melih Kurt Supervisor: \t\t\tProf. Dr. rer. nat. Heinrich Werner Co-Supervisor: \t\tDr. Bernhard Lange Kassel, Juli 2014 Abstract (English) The European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) reported in 2007 the importance of offshore wind energy with following statement: “As a strategic, domestic and largely untapped resource, offshore wind is one of the key technologies for achieving the energy and climate goals of the EU. In particular, it will be one of the key components in helping the EU deliver its recently agreed target of 20% of its total energy consumption being provided by renewable sources by 2020. Because of its scale and extra-territorial nature, offshore wind should be considered a project of European interest.”Â­ [1] According to the situation above, in the last few years, the penetration of the offshore wind energy is progressing in Europe. As it is reported by EWEA in [2], with the full grid connection of 418 new offshore wind turbines with a capacity of over 1,5 GW in the first half of 2013, offshore wind power reached 6.562 MW in total in 69 wind farms in eleven European countries. In Germany, the first offshore wind farm, “alpha ventus,” with 12 wind turbines and 60MW of total capacity situated in the North Sea 45 km north of the island of Borkum was erected in 2009. As to commercial view of the offshore wind power market, the first offshore wind farm EnBW Baltic 1 with 48.3MW of total capacity was put into operation in 2011. Since September 2013, BARD Offshore 1 wind farm supplies with 80 wind turbines a total capacity of 400MW offshore wind energy from North Sea. And it the aim of the German government that the installed capacity of electricity generation from offshore wind power in Germany will increase to 20 GW - 25 GW installed capacity in 2030. Besides the advantages of the high offshore potential, there are, however, several challenges as to the safe and consistent grid integration of offshore wind farms. For the energy utilities, therefore, the balancing and control of fluctuating offshore wind power will be critical [3]. It is a known fact that the wind conditions over the ocean are known just partly. The large heat capacity of the ocean and the variable roughness of the sea surface cause differences on the offshore vertical wind profile compared to onshore [4]. In order to improve the penetration of wind energy in the energy mix and to manage this high penetratration of fluctuating energy source, wind power forecasting is indispensable. The accuracy of wind power prediction plays a central role in grid reliability and the need for balancing energy, and hence the cost of wind power integration. Compared to onshore, offshore wind farms have higher capacity. These high capacity factors of the offshore wind farms and different wind conditions on the sea require new innovations to provide a secure electricity grid. The aim of this PhD is to develop offshore specific advanced wind power forecasting techniques, to investigate forecast error based on availability of historical data and also to improve the accuracy of prediction systems using different methods via a better understanding of the offshore wind conditions and wind profile. The uncertainty of the developed offshore wind power predictions will be analyzed.

Insbesondere geburtsstag wird es eine der wichtigsten Komponenten bei der Unterstützung der EU beim kürzlich vereinbarten Ziel von 20% des gesamten Energieverbrauchs durch erneuerbare Energiequellen bis zum Jahr 2020 zu liefern. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der extraterritorialen Charakters sollte Offshore-Wind als ein Projekt von europäischem Interesse betrachtet werden. \" [1] Unter Berücksichtigung der Situation oben schreitet die Penetration der Offshore-Windenergie in Europa in den letzten Jahren offenbar voran. Wie es von EWEA in [2] berichtet, erreicht Offshore-Windenergie mit den im ersten Halbjahr 2013 neu kaput 418 Offshore-Windturbinen mit einer Leistung von über 1,5 GW, insgesamt 6.562 MW in 69 Windparks in elf europäischen Ländern. In Deutschland wurde der erste Offshore-Windpark \"alpha ventus\" (12 Windkraftanlagen, 60 MW Kapazität, in der Nordsee 45 km nördlich der Insel Borkum) im Jahr 2009 errichtet. Als kommerzielle Ansicht von Offshore-Windenergiemarkt wurde der erste Offshore-Windpark EnBW Baltic 1 im Jahr 2011 in Betrieb genommen. Seit September 2013 liefert BARD Offshore 1 Windpark mit 80 Windenergieanlagen 400 MW Offshore-Windenergie von Nordsee. Es ist von der deutschen Regierung gezielt, dass die installierte Leistung der Offshore-Windkraft in Deutschland im Jahr 2030 auf 20 -25 GW erhöhen soll. Neben den Vorteilen des hohen Offshore-Potenzials, gibt es jedoch mehrere Herausforderungen, um sichere und konsistente Netzintegration von Offshore-Windparks zu gewährleisten. Von daher wird der Ausgleich und die Kontrolle der schwankenden Offshore-Windkraft für die Energieversorgungsunternehmen entscheidend sein [3]. Es ist schade, dass die Windverhältnisse über dem Meer nur teilweise bekannt sind. Die große Wärmekapazität des Ozeans und die variable Rauigkeit der Meeresoberfläche verursachen Unterschiede auf dem vertikalen Windprofil bei Offshore im Vergleich zu Onshore [4]. Um den Anteil der Windenergie im Energiemix zu erhöhen und diese hoher Anteil von fluktuierender Energiequelle zu verwalten ist die Windleistungsvorhersage unentbehrlich. Genauigkeit der Windleistungsvorhersage spielt eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Netzzuverlässigkeit, Bedarf für Regelenergie und damit bei den Kosten für die Integration der Windenergie. Im Vergleich zur Onshore-Windparks haben die Offshore-Windparks höherer Kapazität. Diese hohen Kapazitätsfaktoren von Offshore-Windparks und unterschiedliche Windbedingungen auf See erfordern neue Innovationen, um eine sichere Stromnetz bereitzustellen. Das Ziel dieser Promotion ist die Entwicklung von Offshore spezifischen Windleistungsprognosen, Untersuchung der Prognosefehler basierend auf Verfügbarkeit der historischen Daten und auch Verbesserung der Genauigkeit der Vorhersagesysteme mit unterschiedlichen Methoden durch ein besseres Verständnis von Offshore-Windbedingungen und Windprofil. Die Unsicherheiten der entwickelten Offshore-Windleistungsvorhersagen werden analysiert. Und ich komme aus der Türkei.

Introduction and Summary One of the most discussed problems of the last years in the whole world, which poses risks for the all creatures, is surely “global warming”. There are different opinions and thesis about global warming and its reasons. Lots of researchers are involved in understanding the causes of global warming and while some of experts claim that it is mostly a natural process, others relate it directly with changing human activities. In [5], the authors emphasized the causes and consequences of climate change for human and natural systems and also indicated that the average surface temperature has increased about 0.7 °C over the last 100 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated in [6] that human activities are playing a key role in the increased atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)) and that human activity is also main reason of observed global warming since mid of last century. In addition to this, it is a known fact that there is a relation between environmental problems including natural catastrophes and global warming. As a result, in recent years, several research institutes and companies have focused on reducing fossil fuels consumption, which is the main artificial source of carbon dioxide discharge, and replacing those with renewable energy sources like wind energy and solar energy. In addition to global warming and its risks, the oil crises, nuclear disasters, decrease of energy resources like oil and natural gas, air and water pollution, environmental problems, dependency on energy from other countries are some other reasons why countries are trending towards renewable energy sources. The shift to renewable energies not onlyreduces risks, but it also has also many advantages. In [7] the advantages and disadvantages of different energy sources are analyzed. A briefly summary of the advantages of renewables is listed below. Reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and improves energy independency No discharge environmental pollutants, reduction of CO2 production Through production and maintenance jobs in created various branches all over the world Unlike nuclear power plants, there are no security risks Free, clean and richly available. Unfortunately most governments take steps to renewable energies only after big energy crisis or disasters. As recent concrete example of this is that many countries have revised their energy policy after the Fukushima disaster in Japan in the year 2011. The German government has decided to shut down all nuclear reactors in Germany by 2022 and to accelerate installation of renewable energies after this disaster. But political interests change; these encouraging decisions unfortunately can be revised again. From this point view politics can be seen sometimes as a big barrier, which restricts realization of “Energiewende” (German word for “energy transition”). Due to the fluctuating characteristics of the weather dependent renewable resources like wind and solar, the power generation from those resources is also not stable. This intermittent power is also generated in a decentralized way, unlike conventional producers. These issues could cause destabilization of grid in high penetration of these fluctuating energy producers. This increases the need of reserve energy for keeping the energy system stable, which is nowadays covered by conventional producers like gas and coal power stations. For that reason, it is planned to support old coal power stations in Germany in the “Energiewende”, which describes the rules and targets for shifting the energy supply from fossil and nuclear to renewable sources and it is aimed to get energy demand from renewable sources by 2050 in Germany. “Energiewende” covers not just energy source shifting, but also reduction of greenhouse gases, reduction of primary energy and electricity consumption, and improvement of energy efficiency. Because of its high potential and innovative developments in turbine technologies, wind energy is considered to be one of the most promising renewable energy sources for achieving energy targets of governments and for overcoming environmental problems and global warming. Especially offshore wind power, with its higher production capacity -- approximately two times more full load hours than onshore [8] -- is indispensable for the reduction of greenhouse gasses and energy dependency. The European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) reported in 2007 the importance of offshore wind energy with following statement: “As a strategic, domestic and largely untapped resource, offshore wind is one of the key technologies for achieving the energy and climate goals of the EU. In particular, it will be one of the key components in helping the EU deliver its recently agreed target of 20% of its total energy consumption being provided by renewable sources by 2020. Because of its scale and extra-territorial nature, offshore wind should be considered a project of European interest.”Â­Â­Â­ [9] According to the situation above, in the last few years, the penetration of offshore wind energy is progressing in Europe. As it is reported by EWEA in [2], with the full grid connection of 418 new offshore wind turbines with a capacity of over 1.5 GW year 2013, offshore wind power reached 6,562 MW in total from 69 wind farms in eleven European countries. This new installed capacity was one-third more than installed offshore wind energy in 2012. In Germany, the first offshore wind farm “alpha ventus” with12 wind turbines, 60MW capacity, situated in the North Sea 45 km north of the island of Borkum was erected in 2009. As to commercial view of offshore wind power market, the first offshore wind farm EnBW Baltic 1 has been put into operation in 2011 in Baltic Sea. Since September 2013, BARD Offshore 1 wind farm supplies with 80 wind turbines 400MW offshore wind energy from Nord Sea. And it is aimed by German government that the installed capacity of electricity generation from offshore wind power in Germany shall increase to 25 GW installed capacity in 2030. Beside the advantages of the high offshore potential, there is however several challenges as to safe and consistent grid integration of offshore wind farms. For the energy utilities, therefore, the balancing and control of fluctuating offshore wind power will be critical [3]. Another issue of offshore wind energy is that the wind conditions over the ocean are known just partly. The large heat capacity of the ocean and the variable roughness of the sea surface cause differences on the offshore vertical wind profile compared to onshore [4]. Wind power forecasting, predicts expected power from wind source, is indispensable to improve the penetration of wind energy in the energy mix and accuracy of it plays a key role in the grid reliability, need for the balancing energy and hence the cost of wind power integration; shortly to make it profitable and manageable. This role will be progressively more important, with focus on the additional planned German offshore wind farms in the Baltic and North Sea. In the next years, the planned 25 GW of offshore wind power will require improvement of wind power forecasts. Otherwise an increase of reserve requirements will be required because of the offshore capacity factors of about 40% and the fact that the installation of large capacity offshore wind parks in such a comparable small region may not profit well enough from regional smoothing effects [10]. These kinds of effects make offshore wind power difficult to predict. Additionally, the economic risks are also relatively higher than the onshore wind power, because of the higher capital costs [3]. Advanced wind power prediction models based on numerical weather predictions (NWP) are a basic technology for facing the network problems raised by high penetration of wind energy. In addition to the forecast of the total output of the wind turbines for the next days (up to 72 hours), short term high-resolution forecasts are the basis for secure power system management [11]. Motivation, objectives, problem statement and focus This subchapter presents the outline of this PhD work. It includes the motivation; asked questions in case of different situations related with problem statement, aim of this study and finally the objectives and outlines. Motivation In year 2012 with 11,895 MW of new wind power capacity, wind energy met 7% of electricity demand of Europe, up from 6.3% from one year before [12]. With over 11GW new installations in 2013, the total capacity of wind energy reached 117.3 GW-- and 6.6 GW of that was offshore. Renewable energy targets of the governments show clearly that wind energy will increase its ratio in energy supply. We face many problems in integrating wind energy into the existing energy system. Especially because the highly challenging offshore wind farm constructions took longer than thought. One of the German TSOs, TenneT, builds also offshore transmission system, claimed the revision of targets for the installation of offshore wind energy in Germany. Fluctuations and non-demand-oriented production are the two main problems with grid integration of wind energy, which lead to risks of instabilities at the grid and maybe a black-out of the complete energy supply; for offshore coming higher capacity and transmission from sea as additional challenges. As a result of increasing penetration of wind energy in existing energy supply, wind turbines are getting more responsibilities, like provision of ancillary services, which are normally realized via conventional power plants. According to EEG (2009), new wind turbines are obligated to provide ancillary services. And it is awaited that the wind farms will be player of control energy provision. So the wind turbines will be often regulated to have a stable network and prevent of frequency changes. If we consider above listed problems, we need obviously innovative tools to ensure integration of large-scale wind energy both in electricity grid and market. One of the tools we need is surely advanced wind power forecasting tools, which should predict energy production as accurately as possible. The prediction accuracy for TSOs, DSOs, wind farm operators and direct marketers plays a major role. Problem statement The challenges of high penetration of renewable energies are already emphasized from the safe and consistent grid integration point of view. Energy produced by weather dependent energy resources like wind and solar has a fluctuating characteristic based on changes on meteorological conditions. Therefore, as a fluctuating energy resource, wind power generation will become a critical issue concerning required balancing and reserve power with increasing amount in existing energy supply. Because of its conditions and higher full load capacity and also lack of experience compared to onshore, offshore wind power deployment brings up new problems. For some analyses and further research the availability of measured power data is indispensable. In case unavailability of power data, simulation of wind power can help as a solution. This leads to these questions: How can the power generation of a wind farm or wind turbines be simulated, if the wind farm does not exist or if there is no power measurement available? What are difficulties and quality of wind power simulation done with using nearby meteorological masts? As stated, NWP is a fundamental technology for wind power forecasting. Advanced wind power prediction models use NWP and power output of wind farms to predict the expected power production. In the planning phase, or a few months after installation of a wind farm, there is often no or very limited historical data available, which we need to formulate the relation between weather prediction and power generation of a wind farm. While physical models do not need any historical data for the purpose of learning the relationship between meteorological data and wind farm power output, statistical models and artificial intelligence methods do need historical data. The historical data need of different wind power forecasting models leads to the different questions: Which wind power prediction approach should be selected in which availability of the historical dataset? How much historical data is required to make a reliable wind power prediction? Does the historical data need differ between onshore and offshore wind farms? How much improvement can be achieved with the increasing availability of historical data? Does the combination of different approaches reduce the prediction error? These questions win especially higher meaning if we consider the longer construction times of offshore wind farms. In case of data availability some new questions arise concerning the variation of prediction error. For a better understanding the relation between data availability and prediction error some further analyses are necessary. What is the dispersion of prediction error with changed hidden neuron count and train new networks several times? How large is the variation of prediction error in selection of training dataset in the same length but from different dates? How much varies the prediction error in different seasons, months and the weeks of a year? Is the prediction error depending on the time period of a year? The questions above help also calculation of uncertainties of prediction error related with available training data. In order to understand the relation between weather conditions and power generation, the dataset can be divided into classes. This can be done by defining weather conditions and searching occurrences of these conditions in the dataset, or via using statistical classification methods. There are different methods of classification of datasets like SOM, K-means. SOM as an AI based classification method is preferred in this study, and the following questions are asked: Is it possible to improve forecast accuracy with using the class information as additional input? Is it possible to improve forecast quality via splitting the dataset in classes? How large is the deviation of prediction error between different classes? The answers of the questions deliver information about the magnitude of expected prediction error. Atmospheric stability pertains to the convective motion of an air parcel in the atmosphere and it is used to determine whether an air mass is lifted or not in atmosphere. To detect the relation between atmospheric stability and wind power forecast following questions appear. Can the atmospheric stability information help to improve wind power prediction? Is there a relation between atmospheric stability and wind power prediction? How large the prediction error between different atmospheric stability classes? Purpose of the PhD work Higher capacity factors of the offshore wind farms and different wind conditions on the sea require new innovations to provide a secure electricity grid. The aim of this PhD is to develop offshore specific advanced wind power forecasting techniques, and also to improve the accuracy of prediction systems using different methods via a better understanding of the offshore wind conditions and wind profile. The quality of the developed offshore wind power predictions will be analyzed. This study will present new approaches of an offshore-specific wind power forecasting system that is based on available data like NWP, measured wind power and predicted wind power. This study intends to research the reduction of wind power prediction error via available data for offshore field, therefore allowing increased penetration of offshore wind power in the existing electricity grid and market integration. This study will also represent a roadmap for developing wind power forecasting models for new on and offshore wind farms, from planning to operation. It intends to develop a model for the forecast of power output of new wind farms, for which no or limited power data are available. In addition to developing a roadmap, this study also will help to determine the length of needed time series and the selection of forecast methods to get reliable wind power forecasts on a decided time axis. This work is going to analyze the development of the offshore wind power forecast quality from beginning of operation. One of the aims of this work is a better understanding of prediction error and its variability. An ANN is trained with hidden neurons several times and different datasets in the same length are used to train it. Available dataset will be classified to find out related data classes with aim of classify prediction error and to extract information how large would the prediction error expected. SOM are applied to realize the data classification. Separately, atmospheric stability classes are also used to detect any possible improvement and expected error. In order to answer the questions above and to achieve the aims of the study, the following data are used: Meteorological measurements from the first German offshore research platform, FINO1, NWP and power measurements from two onshore and two offshore in Germany including the first German offshore wind farm, alpha ventus. Objectives and outlines of the thesis Validation and correction of meteorological data Correctness of meteorological data plays a major role both for the evaluation and development of advanced wind power forecasting models. And surely it is very important for operational processes. The chapter on input data focuses on basic problems faced in the dataset which we use to predict wind power. The correction process of FINO 1 met-mast wind speed measurements is also explained. These measurements are used to estimate the nominal power of alpha ventus, and also for simulation of power generation of alpha ventus. The work flow of nominal power estimation is illustrated and then importance of correctness of the nominal power and improvement with work flow are discussed. Development of a physical model and simulation of wind power To make analysis and calculations about wind energy and grid, we need power output of wind farms. If this data is not available, it can be simulated. A physical model has been developed which uses the power curve of turbines, and via considering wake effects, calculates the power output of wind farms. This model is used at the first step for the simulation of power generation and later on for the prediction of wind power with using NWP. In thisIn this study CFD models are not researched. Development of advanced wind power forecasting models This section explains the methods and development steps which are used to predict wind power generation in this study. Combination different advanced forecasting models Different wind power prediction methods are combined in order to build different hybrid models. It covers mainly combination of physical model and ANN. The results of combined models are analyzed. Development of wind power forecasting based on data availability The training dataset is extended with weekly steps and the improvement of wind power forecast quality is researched based on data availability. Dispersion of wind power forecast error Dispersion of wind power prediction error is analyzed with seasonal, monthly and weekly datasets. ANN is trained with different count of hidden neurons and several times. Additionally for the training of the ANN, different datasets are used, which have same length but selected from different time segments. Investigation of SOM in wind power prediction As a first experiment, the classes generated by SOM are used as additional input for ANNs to learn the relationship between meteorological data and power generation. In a second experiment, the dataset is divided to sub partitions based on classes generated by SOM, which can be a base for probabilistic forecasts. Error of the classes is analyzed to get information about expected prediction error. Integration of atmospheric stability in wind power forecasting Gradient Richardson Number and stability classes are used as additional input to train the ANN. Stability classes are defined based on GRN and error of the each class is analyzed. Development of wind energy The wind energy is the one the oldest energy forms, which was used from ancient times until today, both as mechanical and electrical energy and it is today one of key players of our electricity supply. A briefly overview of development offshore wind energy in Europe and in the world and its difficulties are the subjects of this chapter. Offshore wind power in Europe As mentioned before, the Fukushima disaster is a milestone from the energy transition point of view in many countries. Due to large free surfaces and its higher and uniform wind supply, offshore wind energy became more weightiness and the countries tend to build offshore wind farms to achieve renewable energy targets. The German government has aimed to decrease greenhouse gases about 80% in year 2050 compared with 1990.Wind energy potential of Nord and Baltic Seas is significant to achieving this. According to the targets, the installed capacity of wind power in German waters should increase to 25 GW in 2030. The establishment of Offshore Foundation in year 2005, which moderated the first offshore test field – alpha ventus, was a significant step for the German offshore wind energy branch. In Germany, the first offshore wind farm “alpha ventus” was erected in 2009 and in 2010 began operation, which was also planned as a test field to research offshore wind energy -- and this project has provided a big opportunity to realize diverse offshore research. As to commercial view of offshore wind power in Germany, the first offshore wind farm EnBW Baltic 1 has been put into operation in 2011 in Baltic Sea. Since September 2013, BARD Offshore 1 wind farm supplies with 80 wind turbines 400MW offshore wind energy from Nord Sea. Riffgat is another wind park with 108MW capacity in Nord Sea. The construction of this wind farm was finished in July 2013but because of the delay in cabling this wind farm is not connected to grid yet; it is awaited to connect the wind farm in 2014 to electricity grid. By 2014, 520.3 MW offshore wind power wills be installed in German waters. Out of them, according to [13] 31 OWF with a capacity of ca. 8.1GW are already authorized and 9 of them (including Riffgat) with 2.1GW capacity are under construction (state in January 2014). Table 1â1 lists finished wind power projects in Germany – 3 wind farms and 3 single wind turbines. Table 1â1 Realized offshore wind power projects in German waters (January 2014) Name In operation since Sea Turbine count Capacity alpha ventus 2010 Nord Sea 12 60 MW Baltic 1 2011 Baltic Sea 21 48.3 MW Bard Offshore 1 2013 Nord Sea 80 400 MW ENOVA Offshore Ems-Emden 2004 Nord Sea 1 4.5 MW Hooksiel 2008 Nord Sea 1 5 MW Rostock 2006 Nord Sea 1 2.5 MW Sum 116 520.3 MW As to Europe, in the last few years, the penetration of the offshore wind energy is progressing. As it is reported by the EWEA, with the grid connection of 418 new offshore wind turbines with a capacity of ~1.5 GW in 2013, offshore wind power reached 6562 MW in total in 69 wind farms in eleven European countries. This new installed capacity is one-third more than installed offshore wind energy in 2012. Figure 1â1 shows the annual and cumulative development of installed wind power capacity in Europe until end of the year 2013. Figure 1â1 Development of annual and cumulative installed offshore wind power capacity in Europe (Data from [2]) With 3681 MW installed capacity, the UK is the dominating offshore wind power investor in Europe. This amount makes 56% of all installed offshore wind power in Europe. Denmark with 1271 MW capacity in second position and followed by Belgium with a 571MW offshore capacity. German offshore power is in the fourth position and it amounts 8% of European installations. [2] European offshore wind industry in tries to profit from the high offshore potential as much as possible and they are developing wind farm projects in deeper waters with higher distances to shore. Following figure shows the wind power projects in relation with water depth and distance to shore. The green bubbles show the consented wind power projects and it clearly shows that the projects will reach very big sizes up to 50m water depth and 100km distance to shore. Figure 1â2 Offshore wind farm projects related with water depth and distance to shore in Europe (Source: EWEA) The researched scenarios in OffshoreGrid project, funded by EU’s Intelligent Energy Europe program, indicate that the development of offshore wind power will increasingly grow for the medium term (2020) and longer term (2030). The medium term scenario estimates the UK and Germany as key players of offshore wind energy market and expected installed capacity in Northern Europe approximately 42 GW in medium term and 126 GW in longer term, which should produce 530 TWh electricity yearly [14]. EWEA predicts 150 GW offshore wind energy installation by 2030, which should meet 14% of EU electricity demand with 562TWh annually. Offshore wind power world wide GWEC publishes annual global wind energy market statistics. According to GWEC global offshore wind energy has a huge potential and it could even meet over seven times Europe’s and over four times the United States’ energy demand. Last offshore wind energy statistics [15] including an overview of global wind energy statistics for year 2012 published in 2013. Based on this report, while total amount of installed global offshore wind energy ca. 5.5 GW is, UK has with ca. 3 GB (reached 3.6 GW capacity by 2013) highest installed offshore wind energy capacity followed by Denmark with ca. 920MW by 2012 (1271 in 2013). Particularly ca. 900 MW new installation in 2012 by the UK is very remarkable. In 2013 it was ca. 700 MW new installation. This country is also the owner of world’s highest capacity offshore wind farm, the London Array. In this wind farm each with a 3.6 MW capacity 341 wind turbines are installed, it makes in total 630 MW installed capacity. Figure 1â3 illustrates global cumulative offshore wind power. Figure 1â3 Global cumulative offshore installed wind energy capacity (Data from [15]) From the figure above, it clearly can be seen that most offshore wind energy is installed in European waters, namely more than 90%. The most of the rest is installed in China’s two demonstration projects and this country aims to install 30GW installation by 2020. In spite of its very good offshore wind resource, the US has no installed offshore wind farm yet. [16] Challenges of offshore wind energy As is emphasized often, besides the advantages of the high potential, there are however several challenges as to safe and consistent grid integration of offshore wind farms. Sponsored by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety (BMU),the RAVE research program is one of the important initiatives dealing with different aspects of offshore wind energy in Germany. RAVE consists of a variety of research projects in connection with the installation and operation of first offshore German wind farm alpha ventus. Some of topics researched in RAVE are: grid integration of offshore wind farms, optimization of wind turbine components, monitoring of offshore wind energy usage in Germany, improvement of LIDAR measurement method, ecological research, measurement of operating noises of wind turbines, Realization of joint measurements and data management. [17] From a grid integration point of view, an important amount of wind energy will be produced in a relatively small area; hence smoothing effects are limited compared to onshore wind power. Therefore fluctuating wind power generation will become a critical issue concerning required balancing and reserve power with increasing offshore wind power contribution. Another essential problem is that the characteristic of wind is not so well known compared to onshore and researchers have not so much experience with offshore conditions. Some of other problems faced in the field of offshore wind energy are difficult weather and ocean conditions (storms, big waves, salty water and air), difficulties at construction of wind farms, high cost of development and installation of wind turbines, connection of the offshore energy to transmission system, operations & maintenance, accessibility, acceptance. The cost of offshore wind energy is often used as an argument by wind energy opponents. A study done by Fraunhofer IWES Energy for Offshore Wind Energy Foundation in Germany in 2013 analyzed the energy and economic importance of offshore wind energy for the German energy transition. According to this study, if all available areas in German North and Baltic Seas used for offshore wind energy production, due to cost reductions of energy storage and balance energy, 6 billion euro could be saved per year in electricity production. This is explained by the consistent wind on sea, which makes 340 days per year wind power generation possible and by the fact that power production is more predictable than onshore wind [18]. The trend of the offshore wind energy projects is towards installing wind farms in deeper waters with more distance to shore, and using larger wind turbines [19]. This means that the fixed-bottom installation of wind turbines like in shallow waters will not be preferred. So for that reason, the wind turbine producers and researchers are working on different types of floating wind turbines, which are suitable for deeper waters. [19] introduces among others floating turbine related projects. As can be comprehended from the research areas of RAVE and different aspects discussed above, that there are various challenges in different fields of offshore wind energy and each of these challenges must be met in order to achieve targets like energy independency, reduction of greenhouse gases emotion and energy security. Innovative solutions are required in order to solve these problems. State of the art in wind power forecasting One of important projects, which focused on large scale integration of wind energy, is surely the Anemos.plus project, funded by under the EU’s Sixth Framework Programme. In this project, state of the art wind power forecasting is also investigated and a publication from this project [20] gives an overview of actual wind power forecasting methods and systems that are in state of 2011 under research and in operation. Another overview of the current state-of-the-art in wind power forecasting published in [21] in 2009. This work summarized in [22] which provides a guidelines and a quick overview of the current state-of-the-art in wind power forecasting and to point out lines of research in the future development of forecasting systems. Lange and Focken represented in [23] an overview of the state-of-the-art wind power forecasting with the focus of implementations and experiences related to the operational systems in Germany and also, they examine carefully current state of research and development in Europe. There are basically three different approaches to develop wind power forecasts; statistical, physical and learning approach. Some studies learn models with statistical approaches. And there are models existing, which combine these different forecasting models. [24] [25, pp. 95-117] [26, pp. 195-217] The main input of the existing wind power prediction models is NWPs models such as COSMO model of German Meteorology Service (DWD), High Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM) and the UK Met. Office Mesoscale Model (UK MESO). The aim of physical approaches is to describe the physical process of conversion of wind into energy and to model each of the steps involved. The physical approach uses physical considerations concerning terrain information such as roughness and orography and models shadowing effects of the wind farm. There are different methods of modelling wakes in wind farms, e.g. N.O. Jensen Wake Model, Ainslie Wake Model, Fuga Model, G.C. Larsen Model. It is distinguished mainly as single and multiple wake cases. [27] compares some of the existing wake models in large offshore wind farms. One of the commonly used wake models is the N.O. Jensen wake model (known as Jensen model), which is explained in the paper “A Simple Model for Cluster Efficiency” by I. Katić et al [28] in year 1983. Lanberg has developed one of the first physical models at the National Laboratory in Risoe-Denmark in the early 1990s [29] [30, pp. 80-207]. The system SOWIE and Previento are the two physical systems in operational use for the major TSOs in Germany [23]. According to [31] SOWIE is the unique internationally accredited wind power prediction system on the world. The Previento was developed by the University of Oldenburg and it is explained in [32]. Previento is developing and marketing by Energy&Meteo Systems. The physical models require a better understanding of boundary layer meteorology and detailed information of wind farm and its environment. The statistical approach aims to describe the connection between the predicted wind and the wind power directly through the statistical analysis of time series. Statistical approaches analyze the relationship between weather prediction and wind energy via time series from the past and describe this relationship in a way that enables to use the assumptions for the future. Statistical methods that have been used include such as Kalman filters, ARMA, ARX, regression equations and Box-Jenkins forecasting methods [21] [33]. Wind Power Prediction Tool (WPPT) (Danish Technical University) and Sipreólico (Uni Carlos III, Madrid) are two examples for statistical approach. WPPT uses autoregressive statistical methods to determine the predictions and this model handles the power generation as a nonlinear and time-varying stochastic process [23]. The artificial intelligence methods are another widely used approach to define the connection between NWP and power generation of wind farms. In some studies, these methods are considered as a part of statistical approach but these methods use instead of a detailed statistical analysis, the algorithms that are able to describe nonlinear and highly complex relationships between these data implicitly [24]. Different methods of AI are used for this approach: ANN, ANFIS (Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System), Mixture of Experts (ME), Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbor Search. Wind Power Management System (WPMS), developed by Fraunhofer IWES, is a pioneer example to this approach, which, formany years has been used successfully in operational usage in Germany and different countries [11]. Sideratos and Hatziargyriou presented in [19] an advanced wind power forecasting approach combining neural networks and fuzzy logic techniques. This method provides a preliminary forecasting of wind power based on NWPs using radial base function network, but subsequently, it estimates the quality of the forecasts provided by the NWPs using fuzzy rules. Results from the application of the proposed method to an actual offshore wind farm perform better than persistence prediction [34]. Zephyr, GH Forecaster and Scirocco are a few examples of combination models. The combination models combines the statistical, physical and AI based wind power forecasting models in order to join the advantages of these approaches. Persistence, short-term and day-ahead forecasts are the main wind power prediction types used in operation. Persistence forecasts use the latest measurements as the forecasted value. The day-ahead forecasts predict the expected power feed-in for the next day. They are used for trading of electricity and power plant scheduling. For the regulation of power plants in order to comply with the trade balance, short-term forecasts are used, which predict the wind power in the next 1 to 8 hours. Short-term wind power forecast horizons can be several minutes and up to several hours. NWP parameters, such as wind speed, wind direction, temperature, air pressure and humidity are the main input variables for the classical day-ahead wind power forecasting models. In addition to these parameters, the online power productions of wind farms are an important input for the short time forecasts. [11] [20] [33] In [35] [36] it was shown that a regional wind power forecast modeling spatial smoothing effects has lower errors than a forecast for a single site. According to [37, pp. 78 - 89], in Germany, typical forecast errors for representative wind farm forecasts are 10-15% in terms of RMSE of installed power. The forecast of power productions of control areas are estimated via extrapolation of representative wind farm forecasts and the forecast error for the control areas is in general 6-7%. The error value for the whole of Germany is only 5-6%. The wind power prediction error between 5 to 40 hours varies between 10 to 15 % in terms of NMAE (normalized mean absolute error) [38], these results are enforced by results in [39]. As to the optimization of wind power forecasts, further studies have stated that the combination of several NWP models results in clearly better forecast accuracy [37]. In [24], Cali has observed even reductions in RMSE of up to 20% by employing multi NWP model and he mentioned that more advanced wind power forecasting systems based on nested or multi NWP and ensemble forecasts are able to provide more accurate predictions. Nielsen [40] studied optimal combination of wind power forecasts via different methods like a weighted combination and bias-corrected sum of the individual forecasts. He combined the single forecasts and obtained a final forecast which performs better than any of the individual forecasts. Cali has developed and compared different methods to combine different MS-EPS members. A notable method was double ANN approach, which is a two-step model using an ANN for the optimized combination of the forecasted power of several MS-EPS members [24]. Another major research topic is the uncertainty of wind power predictions which involves probabilistic forecasts, risk indices and scenarios of wind power production to estimate uncertainty in point (spot) forecasts. The point (spot) predictions do not provide any information about the dispersion of observations around the predicted values [22]. As a result, the decision-making with the point predictions is limited (e.g. on stochastic optimization or risk assessment) [41]. [20] also stated that, for optimal wind power production management, it is necessary to provide end-users with appropriate tools for online assessment of the associated prediction risk. [42] gave an overview on probabilistic forecasting and stated that next breakthrough in forecasting will come from (i) optimal use of available information, (ii) appropriate uncertainty estimation and communication and (iii) the design of new advanced decision-making methods. “Which prediction system is better?” is a quite difficult question. In different studies and in proposals of wind power prediction tools different results can be met. Because the compression are made with different conditions and based on different criterions. A benchmarking, “Benchmarking Exercise on Short-term Forecasting Model for Renewable Generation”, has been done by WIRE - COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) in 2013. Atotal of 18 participants from different countries attempted to predict power output of 2 onshore wind farms (Abruzzo: 104 MW capacity on complex terrain and Klim: 21 MW capacity on flat terrain) and 2 solar PV farms. Wind power prediction was in done in two categories, deterministic and probabilistic. The best performances of deterministic wind power forecast for both wind farms was provided by Jan Dobschinski from Fraunhofer IWES. The method he used is post-processing with ANN, which got 9.04% MAE for complex terrain and 9.45% MAE for flat terrain. As to probabilistic forecasts, the best predictions done by Norwegian Meteorological Institute, John Bremnes and INESC, Ricardo Bessa. [43] State of Offshore Wind Power Forecasting According to [44], in general, the models and approaches that are developed for onshore wind farms can be extended and adapted for the offshore wind farms. The roughness of the environment differs from onshore and offshore wind farms. For that reason, it is necessary to model the variability of the roughness of the sea surface [45]. Besides the roughness factor of the offshore environment, the large heat capacity of the ocean and thermal stratification of the atmosphere is different from onshore conditions [4] [24]. With respect to the capacity factor, while onshore wind turbines provide 1500-3000 full-load hours, offshore wind turbines provide 3500-4000 [46] In [47], Kariniotakis has given an overview of the state of the art in short-term forecasting of wind power from the offshore environment’s perspective. He stated that the major wind power developments are expected to take place offshore and there exist a need to adapt the current wind power prediction systems to the offshore wind conditions. The new forecasting methods that are dedicated to the offshore case will account for the specificities of offshore wind characteristics, the large size and clustered nature of offshore wind farms. It is shown in [48] and [49] that current wind power forecasting methods can be successfully adjusted to the offshore wind farm conditions. In [50], the prediction error was calculated to be between 9 to 17% in terms of nRMSE (normalized root mean square error), which is investigated as an aggregated wind power forecast of a total capacity of 25 GW in the German Bight. The prediction error for single wind farms which is varied between15 to 20% (nRMSE) in this study. [48] investigated in the ANEMOS project for the benefit of grid integration of 25 GW projected sites in the German Bight. In this study, in addition to wind power forecasting via single NWP, a weighted combination of NWPs (DWD and ECMWF) is investigated to reduce wind power forecast error. According to this study, the regional forecast for the German Bight (25GW capacity) shows an RMSE of 9-17%. On the bases of spatial smoothing effects that reduce the error by a factor of 0.73 compared to a single site, a combined regional forecast for all offshore sites would show an RMSE of 12% at 36h forecast time. It is stated in [51] that “The most complete information that can be provided today consists of probabilistic forecasts, the resolution of which may be maximized by using meteorological ensemble predictions as input”. In this addressed work, the wind power forecasting method which uses the ensemble weather prediction investigated for the Horns Rev offshore wind farm. [24] has researched the grid and market integration of large-scale offshore wind farms using advanced wind power forecasting techniques. He presented a new approach for an offshore-specific wind power forecasting system based on NWP and oceanographic data. He developed a multi-model approach combining different NWPs and advanced combination model approach to improve forecast accuracy. In his study, he has carried out an economic analysis of the values of wind power forecasting. Wind Power Forecasting Models Wind power forecasting is a mature, interdisciplinary research field, which is indispensable to improve both the penetration of the wind energy in the energy mix and the economic and technical integration of a large share of the wind energy. On the other hand, it is an important tool for the system operation and security of power grid. And accuracy of wind power forecast is required for the need to balance energy and hence the cost of wind energy integration. As a result of improving penetration of wind energy, in recent years, several research institutes and companies carried out much research to develop a high-quality and consistent wind power forecast and this research continues without any interruption in order to reduce prediction error and improve the controllability of wind energy and to make it more plannable. At the same time, many different wind power prediction systems have been developed with different approaches to determine the relation between weather forecasts and the power generation of wind turbines as much as possible. This chapter covers an overview of the existing wind power forecasting methods and it includes also a list of developed forecast systems with brief explanations of them. Artificial intelligence -- simulation of intelligence in machines -- has been used in a wide range of fields for different kinds of problems in the last years. Application of artificial intelligence methods in wind power forecasting is also addressed in this chapter; especially two types of artificial neural networks are explained detailed, feed forward network and self-organizing maps, which are used for investigations in this thesis. There are different methods for measuring the accuracy of forecast quality. In addition to methods and existing products for predicting wind power, this chapter also describes the methods for the assessment of wind power prediction quality. Numerical weather predictions are the essential inputs of wind power forecasting, which needed by almost every wind power prediction model. Energy meteorology and numerical weather predictions are also subjects of this chapter. An overview of existing weather prediction models is presented in this chapter. Structure of energy market is essential for the development of wind power forecasting products. Application of wind power forecasting on time scale based on energy trade (short-term, day-ahead) is spoken of here. The role of wind power forecasting in EEX is also explained by projecting the transmission system of Germany. Existing wind power forecasting methods There are basically two different approaches for predicting wind power production; statistical and physical approach. Some studies handle learning models as a third approach. While physical models consider physical processes in order to define the relation between meteorological predictions and power generation, statistical models uses time series. And there are also models, which combine these different forecasting approaches. Physical approaches Physical models use physical considerations concerning terrain information such as roughness and orography and is also one way of modeling the shadowing effects of wind farms. The physical approach contains a chain of models of different physical processes: environmental conditions of the sites and height of the wind turbine shadowing effects of the wind farm Power curve of the wind turbine Model Output Statistics (MOS) The wind forecast of a NWP model represents an average wind speed over the area of a grid cell of the model to a certain height. First, the specific wind speed and direction of the location at the hub height of the wind turbine must be estimated. In the second step, the shadowing effects of the wind farm are calculated by a wind farm model, e.g. PARK or FLaP. The power curves of the wind turbines are then used to convert the wind speed at each wind turbine on the expected power output. Finally, Model Output Statistics (MOS) are used to correct the results for systematic deviations caused by either errors in the information required by the models, or by inaccuracies in the models. MOS is a statistical improvement method that is based on the historical time series. MOS is necessary for a good prediction quality of a physical model, because the physical processes are very complicated, and the information that is required for the models often have a limited accuracy. Detailed knowledge of the wind farms are needed by physical models, such as the terrain around the wind farm, the location details of the farm and the power curve of the wind turbine. In order to achieve high production of wind energy from wind farms, wake effects in the wind farms must be considered. Wake of a wind turbine decreases the wind available at downstream wind turbines in a certain distance, because the turbine uses the wind to turn own blades. As a result of turbulence created by the upstream wind turbine (front turbine), energy generation will be less effective for a certain distance from the downwind direction wind turbines. According to [52] the average power loss in large offshore wind farms due to wakes is approximately 10% to 20% of the total energy production. There are different methods of modelling wakes in wind farms, e.g. N.O. Jensen Wake Model, Ainslie Wake Model, Fuga Model, G.C. Larsen Model. It is distinguished mainly as single and multiple wake cases. [27] compares some of the existing wake models in large offshore wind farms. One of commonly used wake models is N.O. Jensen wake model (known as Jensen model), which is explained in [28]. In this study, because of its simplicity and good results in benchmarks, the Jensen model is used to calculate losses of wind speeds at downstream wind turbines. The Jensen model for simple and multiple wakes are explained briefly in following section. N.O. Jensen’s Wake Model This simple single wake model performs well on calculation of wake loses and it is already implemented in commercial wind power prediction tools like WAsP and WindPro. The Jensen model is based on the assumption of a linearly expanding wake with a downstream velocity deficit that is only dependent of the distance behind the rotor. Figure 2â1 illustrates Jensen’s single wake model, that models wake loses behind just one turbine. It does not consider multiple wakes. x: distance u0: undisturbed velocity D: rotor diameter k: slope or wake decay coefficient ux: velocity in the wake Figure 2â1 N.O. Jensen single wake model The calculation of wind velocity behind a single turbine with a distance of x formulated as following: \t(2.1) where ct is the thrust coefficient; D is the rotor diameter of the up-wind turbine; and Dw is the rotor diameter at distance, x, in downstream. \t(2.2) Depending upon wind farm geometry and wind turbines sizes, downstream wind turbines can be partly shadowed. If it is just a partial shadowing, then this basic formula must be extended with considering overlapping area. Following figure shows partial overlapping wake of a downstream wind turbine. Figure 2â2 Partial overlapping wake (similar to illustration in [53]) \t\t(2.3) where δux is the wind speed deficit at wind turbine x, is the overlapped area and rotor area of shadowed wind turbine. In general wind farms consist of more than two wind turbines. That means wind speed at rear turbines will be influenced by several wind turbines and it must be considered by calculating combined wake losses. It is possible to find different calculations of the combining the wind speed deficits caused by multiple wind turbines in different studies. One common model is to compute the combined wake effect through square root of the sum of squares of the deficit: \t\t(2.4) where δun = 1 − un/u0 is the wind speed deficit at the nth turbine that is shadowed by n − 1 upstream wind turbines, and δukn is the wind speed deficit because of turbine k on turbine n [54]. Statistical approaches It is obviously that the aim of all forecast models is the formulation of the relationship between meteorological data and wind power generation that reaches the minimum forecast error. Purely statistical approaches aim to achieve this target directly by the statistical analysis of time series without considering any physical phenomena. In order to realize it the statistical models need historical data of predictors (including NWP, SCADA data, met-mast data…) and predictand (wind farm power measurements). This historical data – also called as training data - is used in order to estimate model parameters, which are updated with availability of newer data in adaptive models. Estimation of model parameters or the learning of the relationship between atmospheric data and power production can be done by using different linear, non-linear, structural and black-box models. There are tools using different statistical models and numerous different methods can be found in literature proposed by researchers. Linear regression, polynomial regression, ARMA, ANN, Fuzzy Logic, SVM, Regression Trees, ANFIS, Nearest Neighbor Search, Random Forests, Mixture of Experts are some the investigated methods. Artificial intelligence in wind power forecasting The main aim of AI is to develop artificial methods, machines or software similar to human intelligence by analyzing human thinking. AI is widely in operation in very different fields such as classification, natural language processing, data mining, prediction, image processing, planning etc. Different types of AI have been already used in wind power forecasting, both for application development and for also research aims. Instead of detailed statistical analysis, the methods of AI use algorithms, which are capable of implicitly depicting the non-linear and highly complex relation between datasets. Different methods used for this purpose are for example: Artificial neural networks (ANN) Mixture of Expert Support Vector Machines Nearest Neighbor Search Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System For both the statistical and AI ​​approaches, the length and quality of the historical time series of meteorological forecasts and wind power is essential relevance to enable a reliable wind energy forecast. In this thesis, the methods of ANN are used to predict wind power and also to classify datasets and the prediction error. Therefore ANN ANN methods are covered in detail here as well as the application of them in wind power forecasting, as will be explained in Chapter 3.4. Artificial neural networks Artificial neural networks, one of most popular AI methods, are computational models developed in order to simulate human brains skills like learning, derivation of new information by learning. ANNs use the algorithms that are able to describe nonlinear and highly complex relationships between predictor and predictand implicitly. Main advantage of ANN methods over other prediction methods is that they learn from experience and interpolate results, even when their input contradictory or incomplete. ANNs are the programs that imitate the biological neurons of humans. Biological neural networks are made up of real neurons which are able to perform certain functionalities and computations such as motor control of muscles and pattern recognition of eyes. These kinds of functionalities are related to the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system in human body. Biological nervous system consists of about ten to hundred billion neurons and each neuron has approximately ten thousand neighboring connections. The neurons consist of cell inputs (dendrites), cell body (soma) with nucleus, cell membrane and a nerve fibers (axon) with synapses (cell outputs). See Figure XX. The dendrites conduct electrochemical impulses, which they receive from other neurons via synapses, on to the proper cell body. The processed information is biological information, which essentially consists of electrical nerve impulses and lead to biochemical reactions. When the sum of pulses reaches a certain voltage threshold, the cell body transmitted on an impulse through the axon via synapses to other neurons by the neighboring dendrites. By the pulse signal of the axon a biochemical substance (neurotransmitter) is raised in the synapses first, which in turn causes an electrical stimulus in the dendrites of the downstream (postsynaptic) neurons. These synapses can increase or reduce the potential of the downstream neuron. In this manner, a neuron weights the received signals. Similar to biological neuron, an artificial neuron can have many inputs and outputs. Figure XX illustrates the structure of biological and artificial neurons. Figure 2â3 Structure of a biological neuron (left) and an artificial neuron (right) Similarly, ANNs are made up of interconnected artificial neurons that imitate the nature of biological neural networks. Artificial Neural Networks (right half of Figure XX) consist of several interconnected neurons, which are arranged in layers. A distinction is mainly between three different types of neurons; input neurons associated with the input layer, hidden neurons belong to hidden layers and output units are assigned to the output layer. The input neurons receive information from outside, while the output neurons return the result of the network. The hidden units, which are located between the input and output layer, can be thought of as a kind of internal representation of the neural network. ANN has a number of advantages and disadvantages, some of them are listed in following table. Table 2â1 Advantages and disadvantages of Artificial Neural Networks Advantages Capability to implicitly determine complex nonlinear relationships between predictors and predictands. Simplifies the models compared with the statistical and physical model ANNs have ability to work with noisy data and they can detect interactions between independent variables Its parallel structure allows proceeding even though an element of ANN fails. Because of learning capability, it is not necessary to program it, which makes it quite simple to implement ANN in many applications. Disadvantages Needs big data set in order to train the ANNs and they tend to over-fitting. Training can be slow in case of large data sets. It must be trained before it is operated and because of “black box” nature it is difficult to analyze the internal structure Mathematical model of a neuron The neuron is the basic information processing unit that is fundamental to the operation of a neural network. A neuron consists of three basic elements; weights, summing function and activation function. The information supplied by inputs (x1, x2, …, xn) is firstly multiplied individually with weight of associated neuron (w1, w2,…, wn), before it sent into the body of an artificial neuron. The body of an artificial neuron contains sum and transfer functions. In the body of the neuron weighted input signals are added together (u) and bias (b) is applied. As next, this sum (v) is processed with a transfer function (φ). Finally the processed information (y) will be transmitted via output or outputs. Following figure illustrates mathematical model of an artificial neuron. Figure 2â4 Mathematical model of artificial neuron Benefit of artificial neuron model simplicity can be seen in its mathematical description below: summing up multiplied inputs with weights \t\t(2.5) considering effect of bias\t\t(2.6) activation function to limit amplitude of output\t\t(2.7) For a specific neuron the formula can be summarized as following: \t\t(2.8) Activation functions The activation function is a function that squashes the amplitude range of the output. Activation function can be any mathematical function but commonly used are linear, threshold and sigmoid functions. Linear Function: Network input and activity level behaves linearly with each other. \t \t\t (2.9) Threshold: There are only two states of activity levels, 0 (or -1) or 1. \t\t\t (2.10) Piecewise-linear function: Once a predetermined threshold is exceeded, power input and activity level behave linearly with each other. The setting can be useful if you want to suppress noise. \t (2.11) Sigmoid function: The sigmoid functions are often used as activation function. The function is differentiable at all points, which is for instance a necessary condition for the gradient descent. \t\t \t (2.12) Neural Network Architectures As it mentioned above, ANN consists of interconnected two or more artificial neurons. The interconnections can be done in different ways, called as architecture or topology of neural network, which is linked with the learning algorithm used to train. There are two basic classes of architectures of ANNs, feed-forward topology and recurrent topology, which are explained here briefly. Feed-forward network (FFNN) In feed forward networks the information flows only in one direction from inputs though hidden layers to output layers, and not in the opposite direction. Therefore, there are no cycles and no feedback between neurons. There are two types of feed-forward networks, single layer FFNN and multi-layer FFNN. A single layer feed-forward network includes only one input layer and one output layer. In input layer there is no mathematical calculations, therefore it is not considered as layer. Perceptron is a special form of single layer FFNN, which was proposed by [reference] and it is used to classify the input in two categories (see Figure 2â5 left). A multi-layer feed forward network contains at least one hidden layer in contrast to single layer FFNN. It enables complicated operations and can handle non-linearly separable learning tasks. Following layers becomes the inputs from previous layers. The graph in the middle of Figure 2â5 shows a three layer FFNN; consists of one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer. Recurrent network (RNN) The main difference between an RNN and an FFNN is that the information flow is not just from input layer to output layer, but also in the opposite direction at least one time. In this way, a recurrent network’s internal state can be altered as sets of input data are presented. It can be said to have memory. It is useful in solving problems where the solution depends not just on the current inputs but on all previous inputs. Right graph on the following figure illustrates a recurrent network. Figure 2â5 Single layer feed-forward (left), multi-layer feed-forward (center) and recurrent (right) architecture of ANN Learning for an ANN In neural networks, we distinguish mainly between two phases: atraining phase and a testing phase. In the training phase, the neural network learns on the basis of training data with a learning rule. In principle, the weights between the neurons are adapted according to the learning rule. There are many possible learning rules for ANN like Back-propagation, error-correction learning, reinforcement learning, stochastic learning, Hebbian rule, competitive learning rule and Delta rule. The learning algorithms can be categorized in learning paradigms:supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is also called as “associative learning”. In this kind of learning, training is done by using input and given output patterns. The supervised learning algorithm adjusts weights and bias of the network by using the error vector of desired output and result of the network for each input pattern. The input vector can be applied by an external trainer. Unsupervised learning is capable of learning with its own self-organization mechanism without using any given target output. The weights and bias are adjusted in response to input patterns onl. These models learn to categorize the input dataset into a finite number of classes. Reinforcement Learning is learning by feedback from an environment. Instead of matching output the learning algorithm gets a grade for the training, which is a measure of the network performance over some sequence of inputs. Table XX gives an overview of learning paradigms and some of associated ANN types. Table 2â2 Learning paradigms in ANN The test phase is to analyze whether the neural networks learned from the adjusted weights from the training phase. ANN does not see the test dataset in training phase and an adaptation of the weights does not occur in this phase. There is also prediction or evaluation phase, in which the output is not known, also called as online process. Back-Propagation Algorithm As addressed before, a single layer perceptron cannot solve complex real-world problems. The more flexible multi-layer perceptron, which contain at least two trainable weight layers, have this capability, and have been applied to solve many problems via supervised training. The problem with multi-layer ANN is that the error of the hidden nodes cannot be specified directly. The back-propagation is one of the highly popular error propagation rules, which solves this problem by propagation of the error back to the input layer. The back-propagation learning rule [reference] consists of three steps; two passes through the different layers of the network, a forward-pass and a backward-pass, and in-between error identification. In the forward pass, an input vector of a training pattern is applied to the input nodes, and it is propagated through the neural network layer by layer, which derives to the actual response of the neural network at the end. During the forward propagation process the synaptic weights of the networks are not changed. But unlike to forward pass, during the backward pass, the weights are altered according to an error correction rule. By subtraction of the actual response of the neural network and expected output, an error signal is produced, which is back propagated through the network – against the direction of synaptic connections. In order to minimize the deviation between actual and expected value, the weights are adjusted accordingly. The back-propagation uses the gradient descent method to adjust the weights so that the resulting error between the response of the neural network and the target values small precipitates. The weight correction function can be applied to the synaptic weight connecting two neurons by deploying the delta rule, which is based on a comparison between expected output and observed output. The gradient descent method starts with a random distribution of the weights. Then the gradient is determined and by a predetermined length - selected learning rate - descended, so the respective weights to be adjusted. The gradient can be defined as a function of a scalar field, which indicates the rate and direction of the largest change in the form of a vector field. The gradient descent procedure is repeated continuously to newly obtained weight combinations until either a local minimum is (or global minimum) achieved or a previously duly specified number of repetitions reached. [55, p. 40] Self-organized maps The self-organizing map or self-organizing feature map (SOM), described firstly by Professor Teuvo Kohonen in 1982 [reference], is one of most used type of artificial neural networks used for organization and discrete representation of various features of a complex data. The main aim of the SOM is to produce a low-dimensional (generally two dimensional) map of high dimensional data set, which enables visualization of a high-dimensional input space. SOM is related to feed-forward networks but its architecture is fundamentally different in arrangement of neurons and also in motivation [56]. The self-organized map is based on the unsupervised competitive learning paradigm and it consists of just an input and output layers, it does not include any hidden layer. The neurons are usually arranged in a two-dimensional regular spacing hexagonal or rectangular grid; Figure 2â6 shows these both arrangements of SOM. Figure 2â6 Self-organizing Map in rectangular (left) and hexagonal (right) grid The SOM has two phases: training and mapping. The training process consists of four sub phases: Initialization, competition, cooperation, and adaptation (learning process). Initialization is the setting of connection weights to random values, wji The competition process determines the winner neuron, which is decided for each input pattern separately and has the smallest value of discriminant function. Using the Euclidean distant as criterion, the neuron with the minimum distance wins. x = { xi : i = 1, ..., D} shows input patterns and D is the dimension of the input. wj indicates the connection weights between the input units i and the neurons j in the computation layer wj = { wji : j= 1, ...,N; I = 1, ...,D } The squared Euclidean distance between the input vector x and the weight vector wj for each neuron j can be used as discriminant function and formulated as: The winner neuron determines the spatial location of a topological neighborhood (T) of excited neurons, thereby providing the basis for cooperation among neighboring neurons. where Sij is the lateral distance between neurons i and j on the grid of neurons and I(x) is the index of the winning neuron. σ is the size of neighborhood, which needs to decreased with time. The topographic neighborhood updates not only the weights of winning neuron, but weights of the neighbors will be updated as well, although by not as much as the winner itself. The weights of winning neuron and its neighbors are adapted with the following rule η is the time dependent learning rate and the updates are applied for all the training patterns x over many epochs. [57] Combined wind power forecasting approaches Both physical and statistical models have their strengths and also weaknesses. Following table gives an overview of main advantages and disadvantages of the both models. Table 2â3 Main strengths and weaknesses of physical and statistical models Statistical / AI models Physical model + No physical information is needed + Very quick calculation - Dependent on quality and length of historical data - Situations with the limited numbers of observations are difficult + Enables to understand physical behavior + Historical data is less important - Need detailed information of terrain, wind farms and turbines - Extensive parameter setting There are models which combine statistical and physical models in order to enhance prediction accuracy with using advantages of both approaches. A MOS is a typical instance of combined approaches. As they can be applied directly to weather data, physical models are often extended with MOS to correct systematic errors. Existing applications for wind power forecasting As a result of the high integration of wind energy, the need of wind power prediction tools is increasing, and that also means that the market for prediction tools is growing globally. It drives the development of new wind power prediction tools or the adaptation of existing products by companies, universities and research institutes. The developers are updating their product family mainly dependent to energy policies and changes of energy markets. Table XX gives an overview of some of the existing wind power forecasting applications, which are based on different methods and using different resolution weather models. This list is not a complete list of all available tools. While some of the applications listed here are running standalone, some of them running web based.

[68] The table above includes just used weather models by assigned wind power prediction tools. Some of these tools have also capability to deal with met-mast, Lidar measurements and SCADA data. Assessment of the accuracy of wind power forecasting The accuracy of a wind power prediction is the most important criteria of its quality and its value. This section is dedicated to explain the statistical methods, which are used for the analysis of forecast results. These methods indicate the quality of defined forecasting methods and explain the evaluation of forecast data. Following metrics are the most commonly used to evaluate deterministic wind power forecasts [reference]: BIAS (average error) MAE (mean absolute error) RMSE (root mean square error) Correlation coefficient, etc. For the evaluation of probabilistic forecast different methods are in usage e.g. reliability, sharpness and resolution, Brier Score, RPS (Ranked Probability Score), CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score). These methods are not explained in this study because this study does not focus on the probabilistic wind power predictions. In this section, the commonly used evaluation methods for deterministic wind power forecasts are explained with their mathematical formulations. These methods can be also applied, if from ensemble predictions one single prediction is generated. Arithmetic mean value The arithmetical mean or average is the standard mean value, which is used most frequently. The arithmetical mean is calculated from the dividing sum of all observations by the number of the observations. The following formula shows this relationship for n observations: \t(2.13) corresponds to the mean of the forecast error for each prediction, and is calculated as follows: : Measured wind power at time i : Predicted wind power at time i : forecast error at time i : mean of forecast error \t(2.14) \t(2.15) Bias The bias indicates the difference between observed and predicted value of an estimator. It is called also as systematic error and expected that its value is closer to zero. : mean of measured wind power : mean of predicted wind power \t(2.16) Standard deviation The standard deviation is the positive square root of the variance. The standard deviation is a useful measurement of variability. This calculation is necessary to interpret the dispersion of a variable in the original units. is the standard deviation of the forecast error for a time series of n forecasts and is estimated using the following formula: \t (2.17) Correlation The correlation indicates the linear relation between two or more statistical variables. This does not mean that one variable affects the other causally. The correlation coefficient is determined by the relationship between the prediction and the actual value. The formula represented below is for the correlation coefficient: Ρ correlation coefficient σ standard deviation Cov covariance \t(2.18) with and Root mean square error (RMSE) RMSE is related to the spread of the values ​​of a variable about its mean. \t(2.19) Normalized root mean square error is to calculate with division of RMSE to installed capacity of wind farm. It is used as main accuracy criteria in this investigation. \t(2.20) Mean absolute error (MAE) In statistics, the mean absolute error is a method that is used to calculate how close the predictions about the possible results. The formula for the MAE is: \t(2.21) The mean absolute error is an average of the absolute error \t where denotes the prediction and the measured value at time point i. Maximum error This describes the maximum positive error of each evaluated forecast. \t(2.22) Minimum error This formula evaluates the minimum negative error each evaluated forecast. \t(2.23) Improvement of prediction This indicates the improvement of the prediction error compared with a reference wind power prediction. \t(2.24) Energy Meteorology and Numerical Weather Predictions In order to predict a future state of the weather, Numerical Weather Prediction considers the current observations of weather and processes these data with computer models. There are different weather prediction models available from different weather services with different spatiotemporal resolutions. There are also predictions for specific fields like energy economy, research, aviation, and news. The forecasts of NWP models are the essential inputs that are required by almost all wind power forecast models. It is obvious=y that the most important parameters are wind predictions: velocity and direction of the wind. Normally, the forecast process of a NWP consists of consecutive reactions with increasing resolution. These consecutive reactions begin with meteorological measurements and observations of atmposhere and surface-level all over the world, made by meteorologists, weather stations, satellites etc. This existing data is considered as starting point and used as input data to the global NWP model that models the atmosphere of the complete earth. The NWP model calculates the future state of the atmosphere by physical laws, which describe weather. Since these calculations are very computationally intensive, and therefore expensive, the resolution of global model is fairly coarse (e.g. 20km horizontal resolution, a grid area: 346 km2) (see Figure XX– GME is the Global Numerical Prediction Model of the German Weather Service). Therefore the global models are run operationally only in big national weather services. In parallel to increasing technological developments (especially capacities of super computers), the weather services are increasing resolution of their prediction models and reducing calculation time of the models. To provide more accurate weather forecasts Limited Area Models (LAM) are in operation. These models focus only a small part of the earth, but with a much higher resolution. An example of a LAM's is the COSMO-EU (COSMO Europe) model (formerly known as LME – Local Model Europe) of the DWD [reference]. The COSMO-EU model covers the Eastern Atlantic and Europe with 665 x 657 = 436905 grid points at a grid resolution of 7 km. Other local models are for example WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model) [reference], NAM (North American Mesoscale Model) [reference]; HIRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model) [] and ALADIN (high-resolution limited-area hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic model) []. In some models, a following next step is performed using a mesoscale model with high resolution. This is especially important when the available LAM has a low resolution and the terrain is complex. The mesoscale models can be used either by the provider of weather forecast data, i.e. by a weather service provider, or as part of the wind power prediction model. COSMO-DE ∆x = 2.8 km COSMO-EU ∆x = 7 km GME ∆x = 20 km Figure 2â7 Weather forecast model chain of German Weather Service (DWD) [69] German Weather Service runs three models for daily operational weather prediction, that are the global model GME , the regional model COSMO-EU for Europe, and the high resolution model COSMO-DE covers Germany, Switzerland, Austriaand partly the other neigbors of Germany. [70] In the practical applications various NWP model data for a wind energy forecasting are often available. Important criteria for the selection of the appropriate NWP model are covered area, spatial and temporal resolution, forecast horizon, accuracy of model, number of model runs, calculation time, data format, and surely the costs. The following table shows an overview of some existing NWP Models from different Providers.

There are basically two types of ensemble predictions. The ensemble members can be produced from different NWP models is the first one; it is called as Multi-Model Ensemble. One of the famous examples of this approach is \"Poor man's\" Ensemble Prediction System (PEPS). [] The second way of generating ensemble members is using just one single NWP and generating from this single NWP different ensemble members, which is called as Multi-Scheme approach []. The way of creating ensemble members is using different domains with different grid resolutions using different initial and boundary conditions and data assimilation techniques. WEPROG’s MSEPS is a typical instance of this approach. Following table gives an overview of some existing ensemble weather prediction models. A list of some of existing ensemble prediction models can be seen in following table.

Wind Power Forecasting on Time Scale based on Energy Trade Germany is divided into four energy regions integrated in ENTSO-E and the transmission system operators “Amprion GmbH”, “TenneT TSO GmbH”, “TransnetBW GmbH” and “50Hertz Transmission GmbH” are responsible from these energy regions. TSOs are responsible not just for provision of energy in their control zones; they are also responsible for grid safety and reliability.. So that the transmission system works unproblematically, the TSOs must provide various system services like frequency stability, voltage control, provision of reactive power, and restoration of supply. Within each control zone there are balancing groups. These are virtual energy quantity accounts that can balance all the actual supplies and withdrawals between balancing groups within a control area. Every balancing group has a responsible Balancing Group Manager (BGM), who ensures that the balance for his balancing group within every 15 minutes is balanced. That is realized by using scheduled energy deliveries prepared by the BGM, who does this with the aid of power predictions. The deviations balanced within balancing groups, caused by discrepancy between prediction and actual value, referred as balancing energy. If the balancing energy is not enough, deviations can be compensated for by expensive control energy, which is mainly supplied by conventional power plants. According to the German Renewable Energy Act (EEG), the TSOs in Germany are obligated to purchase and compensate renewable energies with priority. There is special balancing group, called EEG balancing group, which covers all renewable feed-ins, and it is led by the TSOs. As to marketing of the electricity from renewable energies, there are different mechanisms in different countries. In Europe, it can be traded both in exchange markets and bilaterally on OTC market. Here a distinction can be made between long-term trading and short-term trading based on time of delivery. Long-term trading includes the forward market, futures market and the exchange options market, and for this kind of trading, the traded electricity is supplied and purchased in coming weeks, months or years. In short-term trading, the electricity is traded in the spot, intra-day, and balancing markets. EPEX SPOT, located in Paris, is an exchange for short-term electricity trading. EPEX SPOT operates day-ahead and intraday power markets for Germany, France, Austria and Switzerland. For the wind power forecasting we distinguish between persistence, day-ahead and shortest-term forecasts. A persistence forecast uses the last measured value as the forecast value. The persistence is a good indicator to evaluate forecasting methods. The day-ahead forecast, the forecast of the expected feed-in for the following day, is used for day-ahead power trading and power plant planning. For the control of power plants to maintain power balance, the short-term forecast is used, which predicts the wind power capacity from the next 15 minutes to a few hours. STF is used also for intra-day power trading. Persistence, short term and day-ahead wind power predictions are explained briefly. Persistence wind power forecasting Persistence is the simplest statistical forecast, in which the last available measurement is used as a prediction value. In other words, production of the day / hour at which the prediction is being made, will be assumed as the prediction for the next days / hours. This type of prediction is also used as evaluation criteria for wind power forecasting. \t\tpersistence forecast \t\t production \t\ti (arbitrary) time before the production \t \t\t\t\t\t\t (2.25) Short term wind power forecasting Short-term forecasting of wind power is mainly used for the control of power plants to comply with the trade balance and load management of energy supply. The main feature of the short-term forecast is that it can use online data of the current measurements of wind power and/or wind speed. For very short forecast horizons this leads to a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy. Usually the NWP meteorological forecasts and online power measurements are combined for short-term forecasting of wind power and the weighting of NWP increases for longer horizons (why?). Very short-term forecasts of up to 1 or 2 hours are even possible without NWP data. For forecast horizons of more than half a day, the NWP model data are used and the online data normally not added. Day-ahead wind power forecasting The day-ahead forecast, the forecast of the expected power for the following day, is mainly needed for power trading and power plant planning. Therefore the forecast horizon is depending to the organization of trading, e.g. the trading hours (gate closure time) and days (the trading days). An example of trading hours is the end of the auction time by 12 o’clock, in which the electricity is traded for the day (Figure 2â8). The NWP model starts at midnight with the calculation of the weather conditions for the next day. It ends the calculation at 7 o’clock in the morning and sends the information to the wind power prediction program. The conversion of weather forecast to wind power usually requires a short computation time and the results are available after a few minutes. The power prediction will be analyzed and then used for the day-ahead electricity trade (the physical delivery the next day), which ends on the same day at 12 o’clock. This means that an NWP prediction horizon of 48 hours is necessary and starts with the start time of the NWP model. If there is no electricity trade on weekends and public holidays, the NWP forecast horizon, which is required for the \"day-ahead\" on the electricity trade, can be 96 hours or longer.

The day-ahead wind power prediction error for total German production is about 5.5%; for a 4h forecast it is about 3%; and for a 2h-forecast approximately 2.5%. The prediction is normally done for a selected number of reference wind farms and then these predictions are up scaled with upscale algorithms for desired feed-in areas like control zone or whole country. The prediction quality of bigger areas, projected from single wind farm predictions, is better than single wind farm predictions, which called as smoothing effect. Development and implementation of models for wind power forecasting An overview of existing wind power forecasting methods and developed systems is already given in Chapter 2 “Wind Power Forecasting Models”. This chapter covers standard wind power forecasting methods which are used and developed for large-scale integration of wind energy in this thesis. In thisIn this study in addition to basic wind power forecasting methods like physical models and artificial neural networks, optimization of methods, combination of different methods-- also called hybrid models -- are developed and explained with illustrations. This Chapter also explains the development processes for these methods. In this investigation, an improvement of wind power forecast and classifying the prediction error by clustering is also analyzed. To clustering is done with a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). SOM is an often used artificial neural network method to cluster datasets, which is based on unsupervised learning. Generation of classes and handling of this information is also investigated. The experiments done with SOM are explained in this section. The methods explained in this section are mainly used for day-ahead wind power forecasting. It must be remarked that this chapter does not cover all experiments done in this study. Chapter 5 comprises all experiments of this study, which are done by using methods explained in this section. In order to implement the methods, MATLAB is used. Therefore, in this chapter firstly focuses on MATLAB as a wind power forecasting development environment and thus, the development context of this work will be explained. MATLAB as a wind power forecasting development environment It is surely possible to develop tools for wind power forecasting, evaluate methods or visualize results with many high level software programming languages. But because of its extended tools and built-in mathematical functions -- which enable exploration of multiple approaches and reaching a solution faster than traditional programming languages [71] -- MATLAB has been chosen for this study. This high-level programming language is especially suitable for technical-mathematical calculations, visualization, development of algorithms and real-time applications [72]. MATLAB can be supplemented with add-on products, also called toolboxes, which provide built-in functions in specified fields like statistics, optimization, signal analysis and machine learning [71]. Database, Statistics and Neural Network toolboxes are the mainly used to realize the experiments in this study. Neural Network Toolbox supplements MATLAB with different functions and apps for the design, implementation, visualization and simulation of neural networks. This toolbox supports supervised learning (see 2.1.3 for the explanation) with feed forward, radial basis and dynamic networks. It also supports unsupervised learning (see 2.1.3 for the explanation) with SOM and competitive layers. Some of the key features of Neural Network toolbox are listed below: [71] [73] Table 3â1 Key features of MATLAB Neural Network toolbox Key features of ANN toolbox GUIs for the creation, training and simulation of neural networks Apps for data fitting, pattern recognition and clustering Supports of the most used supervised and unsupervised network architects Parallel computing and GPU support for accelerating training Preprocessing and post-processing for improving the efficiency of network training and assessing network performance Simulink® blocks for building and evaluating neural networks and for control systems applications MATLAB’s specific libraries and toolboxes facilitate implementation of complex algorithms and this helps to focus on own experiments. Development of physical model based on power curve In this study, a physical model has been developed, the so called Wake Adjusted Physical Power Model (WAPPM). This model is based on the individual power curves of installed wind turbines, and it forecasts the power output of each wind turbine. Considering wake effects, the wind power of the whole wind farm is finally estimated. WAPPM uses Jensen’s Wake Model, explained in section 2.1.1, to estimate loses because of shadowing effects in the wind farms. Main advantage of the physical model is that it does not need any historical data to learn relationships between NWP and power generation of wind farms. But it often leads to systematic overestimations of the power output. The WAPPM is built in three basic levels, explained below: The first level is the data acquisition, pre-processing and data conversion. In this first step after validating and correcting wind speed data (if necessary), the wind speed data will be estimated at hub-height. This is possible via different methods like interpolation, logarithmic wind profile. In the second level, wind turbine level, the power production of each wind tribune will be estimated. This step considers wake effects via using N.O. Jensen park model approach. The last level, called as wind farm level, is estimation of the power production of the entire wind farm. In this step, the production of each wind turbine from second level will be aggregated to estimate the final power production of whole wind farm by considering wake effects. The Figure 3â1 illustrates the workflow of the wake adjusted physical power model including the three levels explained above. Figure 3â1 Workflow of WAPPM including defined three levels This physical model requires following specific data for the simulation of a wind farm: Table 3â2 List of required data for WAPPM Coordinates of each wind turbine in wind farm Type and power curve of each wind turbine Thrust coefficient curve ct of each wind turbine Hub heights of wind turbines Rotor diameter of turbines Terrain information (orography, roughness, obstacles...) In order to allow easily working with this tool, a GUI is also developed in MATLAB. It is possible to develop GUIs in two different ways in MATLAB; interactively and programmatically. The MATLAB GUIDE (GUI design environment) has been used to develop the GUI of WAPMM, which provides tools for designing user interfaces interactively. ANNEX I includes the detailed workflows and screenshots of the main window, wind turbine manager and wind farms manager of WAPPM. The usage of the tool is also explained briefly in appendix. Optimization of WAPPM with Model Output Statistics (MOS) As it mentioned before, systematic errors are one of the main disadvantages of physical models. In practice, physical models are generally extended with statistical corrections in order to reduce systematic power prediction error. This extended model needs adequate data to model different weather situations to correct bias between measured and predicted wind speed or wind power. ` In this investigation, the WAPPM is optimized with different MOS methods based on measured power. The target of this approach is reducing systematic forecast error via using historical measured wind power. For this work the three MOS methods are applied: linear regression, double bias correction and stepwise-regression. The details and mathematical equations of these methods are explained below. The Figure 3â2 illustrates the MOS applied to the WAPPM. Figure 3â2 Optimization process of WAPPM with MOS Linear regression Linear regression is defined as \t(3.1) where y is predicted (dependent) variable, , ,… are predictor (independent) variables, is regression constant and , , … are regression coefficients. In this investigation, the predicted power is corrected using the measured power from training datasets. The formula above can be recomposed as: \t(3.2) The coefficients and are estimated from historical wind power predictions and measurements. Double bias correction method has same formulation like linear-regression. The difference of both methods is the calculation of regression coefficient. Stepwise optimization In this study a step-wise optimization has been applied by using power output of WAPPM and measured power of wind farm. It is called as stepwise because the optimization is done step by step at detected optimization break points. This approach uses an optimization function with PCHIP interpolation (Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial) as a least square formulation. Firstly, the local minimizing values of the optimization function will be detected by using fminsearch of MATLAB; in other words to solve the problem min f(x). This function finds minimum of unconstrained multivariable function using derivative-free method, which is generally referred to as unconstrained nonlinear optimization [74]. In this study it uses measured and forecasted wind power from the training dataset in order to estimate the interpolation coefficients. Afterwards PCHIP interpolation is used to apply this correction on final power forecasts. General optimization problem can be formulated like: \t\t\toptimization problem\t\t\t\t\t(3.3) \t\toptimization variables\t\t\t\t\t(3.4) \t\t\t\ttarget function\t\t\t\t\t\t(3.5) \t\tsolution set\t\t\t\t\t\t(3.6) In this study following optimization function is used: minimize \t\t\t\t\t(3.7) corrCoef = fminsearch(f(x)) \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(3.8) where and Pp indicates predicted power, Pm measured power. Finally the found solution is applied on final forecast by using PCHIP function: final_Pp = pchip(corrCoeff, Pp)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(3.9) Artificial neural networks For this study feed-forward ANN predicts wind power generationusing the back-propagation algorithm. This algorithm is an example of supervised learning, which means that the algorithm gets input and matching target to train the network. For the purpose of learning the relationship between meteorological data and wind farm power output, the ANN needs to be trained with numerical weather forecasts (wind speed and wind direction in different heights, temperature, pressure, humidity) and measured power values from the past. ANN needs to have enough data in order to figure out the relationship between power generation and meteorological data. This issue is also analyzed in this study to find out the length of necessary historical data to model the relation between meteorological predictions and power generation of wind farms. This is relevant for new wind farms because they have not yet accumulated much historical data. Figure 3â3 Illustration of MLP ANN used to predict wind power One of the main advantages of the ANN compared to other prediction methods is that they learn from experience and interpolate results, even when their inputs are contradictory or incomplete. ANN has a great performance if there is enough data available. Figure 3â3 illustrates the structure of an ANN used to predict wind power generation. As can be seen\\, after an ANN is trained with input and target values, it just gets NWP as input and it predicts power output of wind turbines or wind farms. An important point when working with ANN’s is to find the right settings. There is a variety of settings, among others, the number hidden layers, the number of hidden nodes per hidden layer, network topology, training epochs, training algorithms, and learning functions. Setting these correctly requires experience with ANNa. Because of its random startup initialization, the result of an ANN is different at each new run. Therefore, in this study, training of ANNs is repeated 10 times for each experiments in order to find best neural network. Another issue of ANN is overtraining or overfitting, which occurs when an ANN learns random error or noise instead of underlying the relationship (trend) in the data. In this case ANN fits the training data very well, but it loses its generalization capability and this results in poor predictive performance, which is very important for forecasting systems. In order to avoid overtraining, different techniques can be applied e.g. cross-validation, early stopping, and regularization. The training data should also comprise the random features of dataset. Another ANN method, SOM, is also investigated in this study, which is mainly applied to classify the input pattern and afterwards the prediction error. The experiments using SOM are explained in section 3.6. Algorithm development for hybrid wind power forecast In addition to single ANN, physical model and above explained extended models, hybrid models are also developed with a target of improved prediction quality. These hybrid models combine either results of a physical model and an ANN using a second ANN or by using the output of physical model as additional input, together with other meteorological parameters as ANN inputs. In addition to simple averaging of different methods, three different hybrid systems are investigated, which are explained in following own sub sections. Simple averaging of the wind power forecasts of different forecasting methods A simple averaging of results from different wind power forecasting methods is used as a combination model. The included methods have same weights on the final forecast. Figure 3â4 illustrates a simple averaging of MOS optimized physical model and an artificial neural network. The experiments done with using this approach can be found in Chapter 5. Figure 3â4 Simple averaging of WAPPM + MOS and ANN Hybrid system 1 – WAPPM prediction as additional input to ANN First hybrid system consists of two steps. At first step, the wind power will be forecasted with a physical model WAPPM, and this forecast will be corrected with a MOS. At the end of the first step a corrected forecast will be available. The second step is the training of an ANN. The wind power forecast from the first step and all other available NWP parameters will be used to train an ANN. Figure 3â5 illustrates the usage of power output of physical model as an additional input to an ANN. In other words, this approach injects power prediction of a physical model into an ANN. Figure 3â5 Hybrid system 1 uses prediction of WAPPM as addition input to train ANN After the training of an ANN, it gets again NWP and power prediction of WAPPM from same NWP as input and predicts power output. This method can be considered a correction of the physical model by using an ANN. Hybrid system 2 – Double ANN 1 This hybrid approach is more complex than the first one; it uses a physical model and two different ANNs to predict the final power production of a wind farm. The physical model and the first ANN (ANN1) use the same NWP dataset to forecast wind power. The forecast of the physical model will corrected with a MOS as in the first hybrid system. The second ANN (ANN2) uses both forecasts from optimized physical model and ANN1, and measured power of wind farm. Figure XX illustrates the training of ANN1 and also ANN2. In this approach, the second ANN uses just power predictions as input. Figure 3â6 Hybrid 2 - Training of ANN1 and ANN2 and some other thing which outputs PW which must be important but I don’t see where it goes After training ANN2, it will be used to forecast the final wind power. In this case the physical model and ANN1 will be feed-in just with NWP and the predictions of these methods are sent to ANN2 to make a prediction with using to different methods’ forecasts. This approach tries to reduce prediction error by using a second ANN. Prediction of the wind power with using double ANN is illustrated in Figure 3â7. Figure 3â7 Hybrid 2 - Prediction of the wind power by applying double ANN Hybrid system 3 – Double ANN 2 Hybrid system 3 has a similar structure like the hybrid system 2; it also uses two separate ANNs. This approach extends the first ANN (ANN1) with results of WAPPM. The physical model will be firstly run to predict the wind power with the training dataset and it will be then corrected with a MOS method. The next step is the training of the first ANN. In addition to the NWP, the corrected forecast of the physical model is used to train ANN1. The same data, which ANN1 takes as input, is also applied again to predict wind power with ANN1. The second ANN (ANN2) is trained with the forecast of ANN1 and forecast of the MOS extended physical model. An illustration of this approach can be seen in Figure 3â8. Figure 3â8 Illustration of training with hybrid system 3 After training ANN2, the following steps will be applied to evaluate this network: 1) Physical model predicts again with using NWP and its results are corrected with MOS. 2) ANN1 takes NWP and corrected forecast of physical model as input. 3) Finally ANN2 gets the corrected forecast of physical model and ANN1 to make a final prediction, which is illustrated in following figure. Figure 3â9: Wind power forecasting with hybrid 3 system Application of SOM in wind power forecasting SOM is one of most used type of artificial neural networks applied for organization and discrete representation of various features of a complex dataset. SOM is basically used to classify the numerical weather prediction data in this study. This class information is used for a better understanding of uncertainties of forecast error as well as additional input to train ANN in order to perform possible improvement of WPF. The experiments done by using SOM are explained in following sections. Determination of classes with SOM As an unsupervised learning method, SOM takes just meteorological parameters as input. It does not take the power generation as input for training purpose, which we use to train ANN. Following figure illustrates a two dimensional Self-Organizing Map with meteorological parameters. Figure 3â10 A 2-dimenisonal Self-Organizing Map with meteorological parameters One of the main issues of clustering a dataset with SOM is the selection of input parameters. The SOM is based in its training algorithm on to determine the winner as the weight vector which has the smallest distance to input vector. This distance can be thereby influenced by not entering all inputs in interval [0, 1], but the most important ones with bigger weights (e.g. 2 times). But depending on the SOM implementation , the input will be pre-processed and automatically calculated back in interval [0, 1]. Because of that, it is safer to simply enter important parameters multiple times instead of multiplying it. In this case the next question will be how many times should be injected each parameter. Correlation coefficient parameter is used to answer this question. Correlation between each parameter and output is estimated and so decided how many time a parameter appears in the dataset. \t(3.10) \t(3.11) Using SOM classes as additional input The classes of meteorological parameters, generated via SOM, are used as additional input with numerical weather predictions for the training of ANNs. While one investigation uses directly number of class (1, 2, 3 …n) as input in one column, the other one has for each class an additional column filled with binary flags. The evaluated sample belongs to a class; the related column is filled with 1, while others get 0. This is explained with following example for n classes: Table 3â3 Assignment of binary flags for each SOM class as additional parameter Column Class Number Class 1 Class 2 Class 3 … Class n 1 1 0 0 … 0 2 0 1 0 … 0 … 0 0 … … 0 n 0 0 0 .. 1 If a sample from dataset categorized in class 1, then just class 1 column will have the value 1 and the others 0. For the case of class 2, the column of class 2 has flag 1, while the others will be flagged as 0. Figure 3â11 illustrates the investigation of using SOM classes as additional input with NWP to train ANN. Figure 3â11 SOM classes as input additional with NWP to ANN Training each class separately After determining the classes with SOM, the training dataset is split into n (number of classes) subsets. See Figure XX. An ANN is separetly trained for each subset. This approach splits test dataset also into classes with SOM and each class is tested with assigned network trained before. The predictions of the classes are compared with and without class own training. The separate training of each class requires the creation of subsets via splitting training dataset into groups. This is the main disadvantage of this experiment, because reduces the amount of training data available to learn the relationship between input and output for each class. If the training data is not long enough or the classes in train and test dataset are not correlating much, this relationship cannot be estimated well. Figure 3â12 Illustration of training ANN for each SOM class separately Training the worse and the better classes separately This experiment splits the dataset in two basic classes; worse classes and better classes. After predicting power generation with the complete dataset, the dataset has been split into the classes and the error of each class has been calculated separately. The results of classes are compared with final result and if it is better than final result this class is joined to group of better classes, otherwise it is added to worse classes. In this context worse class indicates the classes which have worse predictions than the final prediction calculated from the complete, undivided dataset. Opposite to worse classes, the better class is the combination of classes which deliver better results than final results. After splitting data in better and worse classes, they have been trained separately with own ANN. To summarize this investigation, the dataset is split in the better and worse classes and two ANNs are trained for these classes to predict wind power. Integration of atmospheric stability in wind power prediction Atmospheric stability pertains to the convective motion of an air parcel in the atmosphere and it is used to determine whether an air mass is lifted or not in the atmosphere. There are different methods of atmospheric stability calculation dependening upon which meteorological parameters are available. For this study the available data allows us to characterize the atmospheric stability via the Gradient Richardson Number, which is explained below. The main aim of this investigation is to research the relation between atmospheric stability and wind power forecast. Therefore different experiments are done in order to find this relation out. On one side, the GRN is used as an additional ANN input; on the other side, each class is trained separately. The prediction error of each class will be also presented. Gradient Richardson Number The Richardson number is a dimensionless number that is a significant parameter regarding atmospheric stability and turbulence conditions. This number expresses essentially the relation between convective forces (or buoyancy forces in ocean dynamics) and mechanical forces (wind shear). The Gradient Richardson Number is calculated in this study with: \t(3.12) where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2), z the height, U wind speed. θ indicates the potential temperature, is gradient of the potential temperature and is the wind shear. θ is estimated as follows: \t(3.13) with P0 is a reference pressure and usually set to 1000 millibar (100kPa) [75], P air pressure in millibar and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin. Atmospheric stability classes For this study, the values in following table are used to assign the Richardson number to atmospheric stability classes; it is meaningful matching allocation of the classes to dataset. In different studies it is possible to find different textural descriptions of the meaning of stability classes. Table 3â4 Stability classes based on Richardson Number Richardson Number Stability class Ri > 0.5 Very stable 0.1 < Ri <= 0.5 Stable -0.1 < Ri <= 0.1 Neutral 0.5 < Ri <= -0.1 Unstable Ri < -0.5 Very unstable Input data for development of forecasting models In order to conduct the experiments of this investigation different data sources, including NWPs, met-mast measurements, wind power measurements from WTs or WFs, are used. One of the biggest challenges of wind power forecasting development is getting the dataset ready for use.The data is needed to develop forecasting systems and to evaluate or improve already developed systems. The preparation of dataset here means not just selecting the dataset for prediction purposes, it also contains analyze and validation of dataset. This chapter covers the explanation of data problems faced often in realization of this investigation with available data like NWP, measurements from met-mast and power measurements from wind farms or turbines while developing wind power predictions or simulation of power time-series. This chapter also covers data preparation processes for different forecast types, correction of met-mast wind speed data and also detection of nominal power of wind farm in availability of met-mast measurements. Another issue of data is that generally the data used in order to make predictions comes from different sources, like weather services, TSOs. Each provider uses often its own data format. Because of the non-existence of data standards, an custom strategy must be chosen and pursued for each data format separately, in order to make the data usable. In order to ensure that the input data and consequently the results from this input are reliable, systematic analysis of the data quality is indispensable. Particularly the accuracy of the wind speed measurements is of high significance because the power generation from wind is related with the cube to the wind speed. Hence, even quite small errors in the wind speed measurement would lead to large errors in the prediction of energy production. Some problems at the evaluation of the wind power forecast can be the consequence of incorrect values. ForFor that reason the development of a plausibility tool, which makes an automated plausibility analysis of data, is significant. Thereby only the records are included in the evaluation, which are flagged as plausible. Raw data in this context is used to indicate the data received from the data owners, which is in its original format, not validated, changed or filtered. It does not exclude that the data is changed or already filtered by the provider. Available data This work is carried out with data from four different wind farms, two onshore and the offshore. Alpha-ventus is Germany’s first offshore wind farm with 60.45MW capacity and in operation since 2009. Baltic is located in Baltic Sea and has an installed capacity of 48.3MW. Damme and Wulfenau are the onshore wind farms respectively with capacity of 30MW and 25.5MW. Locations on the map and layouts of the wind farms can be seen in ANNEX II Locations of the wind farms. Weather predictions from COSMO-EU model and power measurements for these wind farms were available. Table 4â1 gives an overview of wind farms and data used for this study.

This data is not used for any prediction purposes in this study. Table 4â2 Available data from FINO1 met-mast for this investigation Met-mast On-/Offshore Period FINO1 Offshore 01.01.2010 – 31.12.2011 Development of a plausibility check For the development of a plausibility tool, firstly the error rules have been defined for an automatic verification of meteorological data and power measurements. The data plausibility tool should detect the following errors in the data sets: Transgression of each weather variables and power values Consecutively repeating data Sudden deviation from the plausible course of dataset Dependency between the wind speed and performance The detected implausible data are removed from the dataset and the corrected data are stored in order to conduct the analysis. In this case a point has to be considered that the difference between two terms “invalid data” and “conspicuous data” must be explained. The invalid data is concerning the values, which does not belong to the prevailing \"true\" value at the time with high certainty. The conspicuous data is concerning the values, which do not follow at least one of the above features. In the case of the automated plausibility check, it can happen that some values ​​are detected as conspicuous, which are in fact valid in meteorological terms. A very reliable detection of invalid values is quite difficult because of different weather phenomena and extreme weather events. Therefore each conspicuous point should be analyzed carefully. Plausibility of meteorological parameters As main inputs of wind power forecasting systems, the correctness of the meteorological parameters has a direct effect on the accuracy of wind power prediction. In f NORSEWInD – Northern Seas Wind Index Database - project funded the EU, meteorological measurements from ten European offshore met-masts are validated and corrected. One aim of this project was was the generation of a wind–atlas for the North, Irish and Baltic Seas as well as the improvement of short-term wind power prediction. Measurements of the first offshore met-mast, FINO 1, is also validated and corrected in this project. This corrected data is afterwards used for the simulation of wind power output of neighbor wind farm alpha ventus. This process is explained in following subsection. Correction of measurements from FINO 1 meteorological mast FINO 1 is the first German offshore research platform located in North Sea approximately 45km off the island of Borkum in year 2003. This meteorological mast delivers different technical and biological measurements including wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, water temperature, humidity etc. in different heights, which provides researchers highest continuous wind measurement database in the offshore area world-wide [76] for a better understanding of meteorological conditions in the lower atmospheric boundary layer on the sea. Since 2009 circa at 450m east of this research platform the first German offshore wind farm alpha ventus contains 12 WTs is erected, which disturbs the measurements from met-mast; see Figure 4â1. Figure 4â1 FINO1 and 5MW wind turbine at alpha ventus The measurements from FINO 1 are used to develop and optimize the physical model and finally for the simulation of wind power output of alpha ventus wind farm, which requires a quality check of the measurements. That means the time series should be checked for hanger, jumps, unrealistic extreme values and other obvious errors. Because of high influence of wind speed at wind energy production, In addition to basic validation controls, the wind speed measurement should be corrected with using atmospheric stability in case of availability of needed data to do it (temperature and wind speed measurements at different heights). As it from Figure 4â2 can be seen, wind blows mainly from south-west direction at this location. While wind speed at 30m mostly varies in the range of 5-15 m/s, at 90m wind speed between 10-25 m/s has a considerable proportion. Figure 4â2 FINO 1 - wind rose in 33m (right) and wind rose of wind in 90m (left) Either the met mast structure, influence from other instrumentation or a wind farm installed nearby causes flow distortions on the offshore measurements, which influence mainly the wind speed measurements and also in a lower degree wind direction. Figure 4â3 is ratio between wind speed at 100m and 90m over wind direction, from which the disturbed sectors caused by mast structure can be easily seen. A correction of the flow distortion of the met-mast for the wind speed is carried out. But it is not possible to correct the influence from direct mast shadowing or influences of a neighbour wind farm. Therefore firstly these disturbed sectors have to be determined using available information from the owner, technical drawings of the installation and maps to completely exclude these sectors from dataset. Because of the very short distance to alpha ventus wind farm, the wind measurements of the met-mast from a certain sector are disturbed also. This disturbed data can not to be used for the development or evaluation of wind power forecasting methods or other purposes like generation of an offshore wind atlas in its raw unchecked form. Hence this disturbed data has been also excluded from the dataset (for details see 4.3.2). Figure 4â3 Wind speed ratio and bin averages of wind speeds at 100m and 90m The quality of the FINO 1 measurements are validated via a procedure of two steps (see Figure 4â4). The first step is automated, based on setting boundaries for each measured parameter, while the second step of validation is conducted manually, supported by automated statistical plots. Certain parameters as specific humidity, the Bulk Richardson Number and the stability parameter are estimated along, as they are needed for the validation and correction process. After removing implausible data, the wind speed data has been corrected based on atmospheric stability in boundary layer. The BRN method has been used for the determination of atmospheric stability. Additionally, the influence of the flow distortion induced by the met mast is corrected. Figure 4â4 Validation and correction process of FINO 1 measurements The Bulk Richardson Number is the most frequently used form of Richardson in meteorology, because rawinsonde data and NWPs supply wind and temperature measurements at discrete points in space [75, p. 177]. This number is a dimensionless number in meteorology relating vertical stability and vertical shear, which represents the ratio of thermally produced turbulence and turbulence generated by vertical shear [77].The bulk Richardson number, from which the atmospheric stability ξ will be derived, is defined as: \t(4.1) where g : gravitational acceleration : Virtual temperature difference between the measured height and the sea surface : Difference in height between the measurement and the sea surface : Virtual potential temperature : Changes of the wind speed at the measurement height and the surface Figure 4â5 illustrates a scatter plot of raw and corrected wind speed in height of 90m. Figure 4â5 Scatter plot of raw and corrected wind speed at 90m from FINO 1 Determination of wind sectors disturbed by the wind farm In April 2009 the installation of the first German offshore wind farm “alpha ventus” was started. Since that time the wind speed measurements at FINO 1 platform are disturbed from the direction of this neighbor wind farm. The methodology described in the wind turbine power performance standard [78] has been used to determine wind direction sectors disturbed by neighboring wind turbines. This approach considers the distance between mast and wind turbines Ln, and an equivalent rotor diameter of the wind turbines Dn. The division of Ln to Dn gives the relative distance, which is used to estimate the disturbed wind sector α. The following equation is applied to estimate α: \t(4.2) The results of this approach from the IEC standard to identify the disturbed sectors α used for the wind farm layout of alpha ventus are shown in following figure. Considering the influence of each single wind turbine the wind speeds from the wind directions between 0° and 183° had to be rejected from FINO 1 dataset. Figure 4â6: Identification of the disturbed wind sectors (red painted sector) at FINO 1 by alpha ventus based on IEC standard Figure 4â7 FINO 1 – A part of raw and corrected wind speed from the year 2011 at 90m Figure 4â7 shows an excerpt of the wind speed time series of the raw and the corrected wind speed from the year 2011 in 90 m height. After validation and correction operations more than half of dataset had been excluded. Especially the exclusion of the sectors disturbed by the met mast structure and the wind farm led to reduced data availability. The reason for the big sectors that had to be excluded due to turbines is short distance between the FINO 1 mast and the wind turbines of alpha ventus (the shortest distance is only 405m). Plausibility of power data and detection of installed wind power The measured power and also knowledge of the installed capacity of wind farms is one of the necessary information to develop and evaluate methods, which depict the relationship between NWP and power generation. And surely the correctness of online power data is indispensable for the operation of the grid, security of supply and market operations of wind power. Similar to meteorological parameters, the measured power data also exposes problems with respect to listed plausibility points in 4.1. Distortions or outliers in the power data lead to inaccurate evaluation of wind power forecast and therefore inaccurate evaluation and adaptation of wind power forecasting methods. Hence, the plausibility control of the power data is indispensable for both evaluation of the wind power forecast and also the forecasting methods. Another issue of wind power data is variations of wind farm installed capacity. The installed capacity of the wind farms are used to develop and evaluate the wind power forecasts and it is also necessary to know for integration of wind energy to existing energy supply. There are different reasons of the changes at installed capacity. One of the cases it occurs is the construction phase of wind farms. In this time period, there are continuously changes at installed capacity dependent on continuously new installed or to grid connected wind turbines. Figure 4â8 shows the changes of installed capacity of wind farm alpha ventus very obviously. Vertical graduals in the dataset can be seen clearly, which are marked with red lines. This is an issue especially at offshore wind farms, because of longer construction period. Because of higher capacity of offshore wind turbines, ignorance of this issue concludes high prediction errors. Figure 4â8 Changes of installed power capacity due to new connected wind turbines at alpha ventus One other reason of changes of installed capacity is repowering of wind turbines. Repowering is replacement of old or defect wind turbines with newer ones or improvement of the tower heights in order to increase the capacity and production. As a result of increasing penetration of wind energy to existing energy supply, wind turbines are getting more responsibilities like provision of ancillary services, which are normally realized via conventional power plants. According to EEG (2009), new wind turbines are obligated to provide ancillary services. And it is awaited that the wind farms will be player of control energy provision. So the wind turbines will be often regulated to have a stable network and to prevent the frequency changes. Changes of the wind farm capacity of alpha ventus in following figure can be result of the regulation of the turbine capacities or turned off wind turbines. The red lines show again the vertical graduals in measured power. We can await that in future most of wind turbines will be equipped in to order supply addressed services. Service, maintenance, failure and extreme weather events are the some other reasons of possible shut-down of the wind turbines in a wind farm and therefore reason of installed capacity changes – nominal power - of wind farms. Figure 4â9 Changes of wind farm power capacity for alpha ventus possibly based on turn off or regulation of wind turbines When this work was prepared, the installed capacity of alpha ventus was not available at the beginning, For that reason, in this investigation, an algorithm is developed to detect the nominal power of alpha ventus. For this task the measured power of the wind farm and the corrected wind speed at 90m from FINO 1 are used. In order to determine the graduals of installed capacity, scatter plot of WS and PW and the ratio between the measured power and maximum measured power output of wind farm are used. To realize that firstly the minimum wind speed that runs wind farm at maximum capacity from different directions, is detected. With help of this information the data points are determined which produces less energy than available in spite of higher wind speed. This hint is used for the detection of a possible change of the installed wind farm capacity. In the next step, begin and end boundaries of this change are determined, and the maximum measured power inside of these boundaries is assigned as the installed power for ththis time region. This process is repeated until most of the edges are detected (see ANNEX II for the workflow of the nominal power detection). This algorithm does not guarantee the best selection of the boundaries for the start and end of a section, where installed capacity is changed. There are different and sophisticated ways of the detection of the edges in datasets, like using statistical distributions. The methods of detecting edges are not the main focus of this investigation. On Figure 4â10 the detected nominal power is shown with the red line. Figure 4â10 Detection of nominal power at alpha ventus via corrected wind speed from FINO 1 Comparison of Wind Power Forecasting Models and Results The wind power forecast methods which are developed and conducted in this thesis were already explained in chapter 3. This chapter covers the implementations of these methods in different experiments for day-ahead wind power forecasting and the results of these experiments are also discussed after explanation of the corresponding implementation. Firstly the wind speed correction of Fino1 is evaluated from the perspective of power production of alpha ventus by using uncorrected and corrected measurements from this met-mast. Afterwards the detection of nominal power of alpha ventus is explained by step by step correction/improvement and the results of wind power simulation for this wind farm are discussed in this chapter. For day-ahead wind power forecasting, over 30 different single and hybrid experiments are implemented. A complete list of day-ahead wind power forecasting experiments can be found in ANNEX IV List of numerical experiments. In addition to these experiments, weekly development of the wind power forecast based on extended availability of training dataset is investigated. In addition, variation of the forecast error with weekly, monthly and seasonal training of ANN is researched. This research is extended with selection of this periodic data differently. SOM is investigated to perform possible improvement of the wind power forecasting and for the classification of weather predictions and also the wind power prediction error. On the one hand, the class information is used to train class own ANN and on the other hand used as an additional input to train ANN. The prediction error of each class is analyzed. Good and worse classes are determined and for both group of classes an own ANN is trained. The results of the consideration of atmospheric stability in wind power forecasting is also presented and discussed in this section. Atmospheric stability information is used not just as an additional input to train an ANN; it is also used to divide the dataset into classes, and for each of these classes, an ANN is trained. The error analysis of the stability classes is also a part of this section. The combination of different power forecasts for the same wind farm, which are generated from different NWPs – in this case from different members of PEPS model of German Weather Service -, is also investigated both with ANN and physical models; the results are discussed. Validation of FINO1 wind speed measurements The scatter plots in Figure 5â1 illustrate the power curves as a result of the wind speed in 90m from FINO1 and the power measurements of alpha ventus. While the left one plots the power curve generated with uncorrected wind speed in at a height of 90m, and measured power from the wind farm, the right one is done with corrected wind speed. As can be seen from the power curves obviously, the left one has a wide spread of point cloud, which contains the disturbed data, while the right one has a smoother power curve. From the both power curves the gradual structure of power generation in higher wind speeds can be easily seen, which proves that some of turbines were turned out or regulated down or maybe new turbine is connected. This problem was addressed already in chapter 4.4 “Plausibility of power data and decision of installed wind power” from the nominal power perspective. The knowledge of actual state of wind turbines, whether they are in operation or regulated, and correspondingly the actual installed capacity of wind farm plays a central role both for the evaluation of wind power forecast and also for grid security, and hence integration of wind energy to the existing electricity grid. \\ Figure 5â1 Power curve of alpha ventus with (left) and without wind speed correction (right) The following step after removing implausible data from the dataset is the detection of changes of installed power of the wind farm. This is explained in following section. Detection of installed power changes at alpha ventus The reasons of installed capacity changes of the wind farms are addressed in section 4.4. An algorithm to detect these changes when wind measurements are available is also explained. This algorithm is applied to the alpha ventus wind farm. The wind speed and direction measurements from FINO 1 were available for use in the detection of nominal power. Before running the nominal power detection algorithm, the FINO1 data is validated and corrected based on atmospheric stability. Figure 5â2 illustrates the power curves as result of the step by step iterations of installed power detection at alpha ventus. From these plots we can see that at each step, the graduated structure of the power curve is reduced. On the final power curve (bottom-right) the graduated is nearly unrecognizable. Figure 5â2 Iterations of installed power detection at alpha ventus After the normalization of the measured power with detected nominal power, the graduated structure of the time series is also eliminated; see Figure 4â10 for the capacity changes detected in the alpha ventus power measurements. The result of this operation can be seen clearly from the Figure XX. This power normalized with correct nominal power results in a better analysis and evaluation of the wind power forecast and time series simulation. Without this correction, this dataset must be excluded from the training dataset. It is obvious that if the current nominal power or state of the wind turbines is supplied directly by the wind farm owner or provider, this elaborate process can be skipped. At the same time it means that the availability of such significant information, in this case the nominal power, facilitates further research and ensures a better database. This information also very relevant for the calculation of total installed power, and therefore, for the upscaling of wind power from reference wind farms. This issue can be solved by related regulations. Figure 5â3 Normalized nominal power of alpha ventus after detection of the installed capacity Simulation of the wind power time series of alpha ventus The availability of the power data is indispensable for the calculations, research or analyses concerning the grid and market integration of the wind energy. But sometimes due to various reasons this data is unfortunately not available or only partly available, especially concerning new wind farms. The power measurements are also needed for the development of the wind power forecast models. If it is not the case, the power output of a wind farm can be simulated as a solution. There are different ways to do this, like using data from neighbor wind farms or historical measurements and adapting it to wind farm. Another method to realize that is the simulation of the wind farm and its environment with the aim of synthetic power time series generation. In order to do this, we need further data including the exact coordinates of the wind turbines, orography of the wind farm, obstacles around the wind turbines, and the technical details of turbines (like power curves, rotor diameter and trusty coefficient). Unfortunately, it is not always so easy to acquire these data from wind farm owners/operators or from wind turbine producers because of security issues or the desire to protect data privacy. In the RAVE-Grid Integration project, a physical wind power model is developed called WAPPM (Wake Adjusted Physical Power Model) and is used to simulate power output of single wind turbines and also of complete wind farm. In order to build a trustworthy wind power simulation system, which depicts reality as well as possible, the availability and the correctness of the meteorological measurements plays a major role. For the simulation of the wind power output of alpha ventus, the meteorological measurements from neighbor met-mast FINO 1 are used. Thus, the measured wind speed time series could be directly converted into the power time series by considering wind farm losses, power curves and technical data supplied from wind turbine producers. The correction process of the met-mast raw data was previously explained. The workflow and a brief explanation of the WAPPM and its screenshots can be found in ANNEX I. As mentioned above, the power time series for alpha ventus are simulated by using the wind measurements of FINO1. Figure 5â4 shows an excerpt of this simulated power time series with wind speed correction (in blue) and without wind speed correction (in green), together with power measurements from this wind farm. It can be seen obviously that the developed physical model can approximate the steep gradients very well and also reflects the fluctuations of alpha ventus very good. In some cases, it is however still a significant overestimation of the power generation, especially with uncorrected wind speed. The power series simulated with corrected wind speed is closer to measured power in the case of over estimation, which means lower deviation. This simulation did not take the time delay of the wind speed between met-mast and wind farm. At some points the measurements and simulations are not well overlapped; maybe the reason is the overlook of the time delay. This can be seen for example between 17-21 hours on 23.06.2011 on the figure. Figure 5â4 Simulation of power out of first German offshore wind farm alpha ventus with the data of neighbor met-mast FINO 1 Following diagrams show the correlation and error of simulated power time series for alpha ventus with raw and corrected wind speed and also with corrected installed power. Figure 5â5 Correlation and error of simulated power time series for alpha ventus with raw and corrected wind speed correction and also corrected installed power While the simulation of the wind power with uncorrected wind speed has a correlation of 89% with measured power, the simulation with corrected wind speed has clearly higher correlation with 96%. The normalized root mean square error with uncorrected data amounts to ca. 17% and it is with corrected data about 12%. The correction of installed power improves the correlation and reduces clearly the error. In addition to the simulation of power generation of whole wind farm, energy production of each of twelve wind turbines at alpha ventus is individually simulated. Figure 5â6 illustrates the simulation of the energy production of the single wind turbines. From this figure, the influence of wake on power generation is very easy to recognize; the power generation of the wind turbines changes dependent on wind speed and its direction. Figure 5â6 Simulation of power output of twelve wind turbines at alpha ventus The results of the simulation with the physical power model clearly show that the simulated power time series can be used for further research, in case of unavailability of power measurements from wind farms. The main challenge of this method is the effort of supplying detailed information of a wind farm, including data for each wind turbine like their coordinates, power curves, terrain information etc. and afterwards the modelling of the wind farm. Day-ahead wind power forecasting The need and importance of day-ahead wind power forecasts for power trading, grid security and power plant planning was explained in Section 2.4.3. In this study, different methods are used for the estimation of expected power production for the following day. A complete list of the experiments conducted in the the day-ahead wind power forecasting investigation can be found in ANNEX IV \"List of numerical experiments” and results of them can be found in ANNEX V \"Results of all experiments.” In addition to the basic prediction methods, the combined methods are also investigated. The improvement of wind power forecasts with availability of historical data is presented. It must be noted that, for the experiments in this section, one year training data was available. An overview on available can data can be found in Section 4.1. The experiments for day-ahead wind power forecasting will be explained one by one in this section, and the results of each experiment will be discussed afterwards as well. Physical Model without considering wake effects This method uses a physical model (WAPPM) without considering wake effects in a wind farm. It means that every turbine in a wind farm gets the same wind speed; in other words the reduction of wind speed because of upwind turbines is not considered. Firstly, wind speed at hub height is calculated for each wind turbine. Following the wind speed calculation, the wind power corresponding to this wind speed value will be read out from the wind turbine specific power curve, which is normally provided by the wind turbine producer. It should be noted here that the physical model does not contain any learning process (or training), therefore,. for the evaluation of the model, only the test dataset is used. Figure 5â7 shows the results of this experiment both for offshore and onshore wind farms. Compared to offshore farms, the power prediction of the onshore wind farms gives better results. Because of the complexity of the topography and obstacles around of onshore wind farms, the simulation of onshore wind farms is actually more complicated than modelling offshore wind farms. But the higher wind average speeds at offshore wind farms results higher prediction error; even small deviations of wind speed cause higher errors. While alpha ventus delivers better results for the offshore, for the onshore Damme represents clearly better predictions. Figure 5â7 Day-ahead forecast with physical model without considering wake effects An important issue of modelling offshore wind farms is consideration of the dynamic changing surface. The WAPPM in this study does not consider the wind- wave interactions for the offshore wind farms. [24] showed that the usage of wave predictions leads to increment of the wind power forecast accuracy. Physical Model with considering wake effects Differently from the experiment before, this method also considers the wake effects in the wind farm. That means the wind speed seen by each tribune in the wind farm is calculated separately via considering park geometry and roughness of the wind farm. After calculating the wind speed on the hub heights, the wake loses at down-wind turbines have been taken into account The wind power corresponding to the adjusted wind speed will be read from the power curve of the wind turbine. Figure 5â8 illustrates the prediction error in terms of nRMSE for all four wind farms as result of the physical model adjusted wake. Similar to the last experiment the offshore wind farms have lower forecast error then onshore wind farms. The results show obviously that the consideration of wake effects improves wind power prediction quality. Figure 5â8 Day-ahead forecast with physical model with considering wake effects The results also shows that the consideration of wake losses improves the wind power forecast at onshore wind farms more than offshore wind farms. The consideration of wake losses improved the prediction error of alpha ventus about 4.5% and it is ca. 5% for Baltic1 compared with the experiment without considering wake losses. For the onshore farms Damme and Wulfenau the improvement is respectively ~10% and ~9%. That is may be an indication that offshore wind farms are better planned to keep wake losses as small as possible. And also the distances between the wind turbines at offshore farms are relatively higher than the onshore farms and obviously that helps to reduce the wake losses because of the shadowing by other turbines. Adapted physical model As addressed in Section 5.3 “Simulation of the wind power time series of alpha ventus”, the physical model overestimates the power generation of wind farm. This problem was noticeable especially the onshore wind farms. In order to accomplish this problem, the wind speed prediction at higher level is downscaled for the onshore farms so that the wind turbines see less wind and so generate less wind power. The results of this investigation can be seen in Table XX. It is obvious that this pre-processing corrects the overestimations of physical model for onshore farms. The experiments for onshore farms in this study, which are using the physical model, are built on this pre-processed model. This operation did not improve the prediction quality for the offshore wind farms, which can be explained by different wind profiles of offshore and onshore fields. It means that the methods used to estimate the wind speed at a different height from available ones could not do as well as for onshore wind farms. At this point, further analysis of the wind profiles of farms could be helpful to clarify this discrepancy. Figure 5â9 Results of day-ahead forecast with MOS extended WAPPM This pre-processing has been repeated for tests with and without consideration of wake effects. As can be seen from the results above, this process helps to improve the prediction quality of the both onshore wind farms remarkably. The prediction error of Damme could be reduced about 7% from 21% to 13.8% and it is for Wulfenau still higher about 11% reduction from 27% to 15.7% error in term of nRMSE. Physical Model extended with Model Output Statistics It was already mentioned that the physical wind power prediction models are often corrected with MOS in operational prediction systems. This experiment investigates this approach for the wind power forecasting. This method aims to remove the systematic errors from the predicted time series via model output statistics and hence to improve the quality of the wind power prediction. Briefly, this model is a mix of physical model and statistical approach. Figure 5â10 (MOS with linear regression) and Figure 5â11 (MOS with PCHIP) illustrate the results of MOS extended physical model and this experiment is indicated as OPT{WAPPM} in the following sections of this study and this short name indicates the best resulting MOS approach. The results of optimization with linear regression are often better than optimization with PCHIP. PCHIP optimization is just for alpha ventus slightly better than linear regression. From the results in figures below can be obviously seen that MOS very clearly improves the forecast quality. Especially the reduction of forecast error for onshore wind farms Wulfenau is quite high; it is about 2.2% reduction prediction error, which means an improvement of ~14% compared with last experiment. An improvement of ~8% could be reached for Damme by reducing the nRMSE ~1%. As to offshore wind farms, the forecast quality of alpha ventus could be improved ca. 5% with 1% reduction of nRMSE. But the improvement for Baltic1 is not so obvious like alpha ventus; it could be improved 3.5% with just 0.6% change of nRMSE. The physical model cannot simulate onshore fields as well as on offshore farms. The results indicate very clearly that a statistical correction helps to improve the quality of wind power forecast done with a pure physical model. Figure 5â10 Results of day-ahead forecast with linear regression MOS extended WAPPM Figure 5â11 Results of day-ahead forecast with PCHIP MOS extended WAPPM The results showed that the statistical correction applied on the physical model improves the forecast quality of onshore wind farms more than offshore ones. A lesser improvement of the forecast quality of offshore predictions can be explained in two ways. The first one is that the physical model simulates offshore wind farms better than onshore wind farms, and so the prediction achieves good results without any statistical correction. The second explanation for this difference can be a general problematic of offshore wind power prediction. The higher capacity of wind turbines on the sea derives to higher prediction errors even in small deviations of the wind speed, because of the high influence of the wind speed at the wind power calculation. The rest of the error can be explained by deviations in wind speed from the weather forecast. An evaluation of weather forecast with analysis data or measurements has been not investigated in this study. It should be a useful investigation for a better understanding of the differences between offshore and onshore wind power forecast error. Artificial neural networks This experiment covers the training of neural networks with historical data and afterwards using these trained neural networks for the prediction of wind power production of wind farms. The main advantage of this method is that it does not need any information about terrain or any specific data about wind farms or wind turbines in order to learn the relation between numerical weather forecasts and wind power generation of wind farms. In the training process the ANN learns via input and output dataset the relation between them with non-linear algorithms. The results of ANN approach with one year training data are illustrated on the following figure. It is very clear that neural networks have better results compared with all other experiments presented until now in availability of one year training data. Similar to the last experiment, the results of the onshore wind farms are better than the offshore wind farms. Alpha ventus has a prediction error 17.02% of nRMSE with an ca. 4% improvement, while Baltic1 reaches 18% of nRMSE with ca. 2% reduction of prediction error in terms of nRMSE compared with the experiment OPT{WAPPM}. As to onshore wind farms, the prediction quality of Damme is improved ca. 5% to 12.07% with ANN and it is 12.42% of nRMSE for Wulfneau. This wind farm proves the best improvement with ANN about 8% compared with experiment before for day-ahead prediction of wind power. Figure 5â12 Results of day-ahead forecast with neural networks Simple average of different models This experiment combines different wind power forecasting models together with a simple average in order to research the reduction of prediction error by a basic method. Combined methods and results of them are listed in following table, together with results of basic experiments WAPPM and ANN in order to compare the results easier. Table 5â1 DAF – Results of the simple average of different models alpha ventus Baltic1 Damme Wulfenau WAPPM 18.79% 18.98% 13.78% 15.70% WAPPM + OPT 17.82% 18.30% 12.70% 13.52% ANN 17.12% 18.00% 12.05% 12.42% Simple mean of WAPPM and ANN 17.20% 17.91% 12.23% 13.40% Simple mean of OPT(WAPPM) and ANN 17.03% 17.91% 12.10% 12.71% Although this experiment does not make anything else just averaging results of different methods, the improvement of prediction error offshore wind farms is slightly reduced by averaging optimized WAPPM with ANN. For onshore wind farms an improvement cannot be observed in comparison with ANN. The best results are reached with simple mean of optimized WAPPM and ANN for the offshore wind farms. An average of the physical model and ANN reduces the prediction error neither for offshore nor for onshore wind farms. Hybrid 1 Hybrid 1 combines mainly a physical model and/or a statistical model via a statistical learning model by injecting results of corresponding model into the statistical learning model. In other words, this model combines the physical model, statistical model and learning approach together. This model uses results of different single or combined models as additional information to train ANN. It means that the training of neural networks is done together with wind power predictions of different models – see following table - in addition to meteorological weather predictions; it means that ANN gets NWP data and the power prediction as input for the training purpose. This model is already illustrated and explained in detail in section 3.5.2. The results of optimized WAPPM and simple mean experiments done in this experiment are also presented. The following table comprises the results of hybrid 1 experiments and the input parameters which are used to train ANN are showed in curly brackets. Table 5â2 DAF – Results of the hybrid 1 model alpha ventus Baltic1 Damme Wulfenau ANN{NWP} 17.12% 18.00% 12.05% 12.48% ANN{NWP, WAPPM } 17.05% 18.04% 12.26% 12.58% ANN{NWP, OPT(WAPPM)} 17.13% 18.07% 12.31% 12.57% ANN{NWP, mean(WAPPM,ANN)} 17.00% 18.12% 12.26% 12.59% ANN{NWP, mean(OPT(WAPPM),ANN)} 16.92% 18.00% 12.22% 12.58% Application of hybrid 1 model improved prediction quality just for alpha ventus very slightly. The usage of NWP and simple average of optimized WAPPM and ANN as input provided the best results with 16.92% in terms of nRMSE for this wind farm. It means ANN could not extract additional information to learn the relationship between weather data and power output. Hybrid 2 This model extends the hybrid model 1 with an additional neural network. This more complex hybrid model uses a second ANN in order to combine the results of a first ANN and WAPPM, which use NWP as input. This model uses power predictions of different methods in order to train the second ANN. Details of this approach can be found in the section 3.5.3. The results of hybrid 2 model are listed in following table; the new experiments are underlined. Application of this model did not deliver considerable improved results. Only if the results of first ANN and WAPPM are optimized with MOS and these results used to train second ANN than a slightly improvement of wind power prediction could be seen. Although its complexity the delivered results of this model is not satisfying.

This approach uses two ANNs as well. The first ANN uses the NWP data and optimized power predictions of WAPPM for the training. The second ANN gets results of first ANN and optimized power predictions of WAPPM. Only one experiment is done with this model and the results are listed in following table. If we consider the results of the hybrid 2 model, it is not surprising that this model does not deliver any improvement of wind power prediction. Table 5â4 DAF – Results of hybrid 3 model alpha ventus Baltic1 Damme Wulfenau ANN {NWP} 17.12% 18.00% 12.05% 12.48% ANN2{ANN1(NWP,OPT(WAPPM)), OPT(WAPPM)} 17.14% 18.07% 12.51% 12.86% Application of SOM in wind power forecasting In this section the results of the experiments, which investigate the application of SOM in wind power forecasting, will be presented and discussed. In this work mainly on three different experiments has been focused. The first one of them concentrated on the usage of SOM classes as additional input for the training of ANN. In the second experiment dataset has been split into groups based on SOM classes; firstly every class is evaluated and then for each class an own ANN has been trained separately. The last experiment is used to train good and bad classes individually. These experiments are explained detailed in section 3.6. Selected map size of SOM for this study is 6x10 that means dataset is split in 60 sub classes. In this study, the SOM classes are determined based on NWP data. Determination of the SOM classes In order to determine the SOM classes two methods are used. First method is the standard one, which uses input parameters directly to train SOM and thus determines the classes. The second method focused on feature selection by using the correlation coefficient, which is explained in section 3.6.1. In this second method the parameters, which have high correlation with output (in this case power generation) are repeated in input datasets related with value of correlation coefficient. The sign (+/-) of correlation is not relevant for this method. The results are showed that repeating same parameter in dataset related with correlation coefficient did not have influence on final power prediction. Therefore the first method is used in following experiments in order to detect the classes with SOM. Following diagrams illustrate the small sections of detected classes for the wind farms alpha ventus and Wulfenau. As it can be seen from these diagrams, the class of dataset is not changing permanently, which can allow to use this information to generate probabilistic power forecasts and to have an idea about awaited prediction error. Otherwise if the classes change always the class information could not be possible. Figure 5â13 Part of detected classes for alpha ventus and Wulfenau At the end, these determined classes are used as additional inputs for prediction wind power. The results of this experiment are showed in following investigation. In order to answer the question of “Does the class information really supply advance information of prediction error?”, the prediction error of two wind farms – one onshore one offshore – are calculated both with training and testing datasets with using a 3x3 SOM map. Following diagrams illustrates the results of Wulfenau and alpha ventus wind farms. The prediction error classes have high similarity for both onshore and offshore wind farm with two different datasets – training and testing. It means that we can obviously use the this information to have advance information about prediction error, if we know the class of a data point by using SOM without any further meteorological background information, analysis or classification. Figure 5â14 Prediction error of the classes in training and testing datasets for Wulfenau Figure 5â15 Prediction error of the classes in training and testing datasets for alpha ventus It should be kept in mind that with increasing size of SOM map the error in training and testing datasets are correlating less. An optimal number of SOM map size is not investigated, which could be an interesting further research topic. The following results of the experiments with 3x3 SOM can be found in ANNEX VIII Results of SOM 3x3. SOM as additional input to ANN at day-ahead forecast This experiment consists of two steps; generating classes by SOM and training ANN. After detecting the SOM classes, the training and testing datasets has been prepared again with adding SOM classes as a number (it varies between 1 and 60) or binary vector to dataset. Following this step, ANN has been trained with additional input(s) and has been tested with a dataset not seen before by ANN. Results for all wind farm listed in following table with and without additional parameter(s). Table 5â5 Day-ahead WPF - SOM class as additional input for training ANN As can be observed from table above, an improvement of day-ahead WPF could not be observed by using SOM class numbers or binary vector as additional input. Using the class numbers results just slightly changes on prediction error. It has a small improvement of Wulfenau’s prediction quality and on Baltic1 there is almost no change and the predictions of alpha ventus and Damme have been slightly worse. The application of SOM binary vectors as additional input has worsened the predictions obviously rather than an improvement. These results indicate that ANN cannot extract any new information from SOM class, which are actually generated from same dataset in this case NWP. Investigation of the forecast error based on SOM-Classes This investigation focused on the analysis of prediction error of every the SOM classes separately. In a first investigation a single ANN has been trained without using any information supplied by SOM. Parallel to this SOM has been trained to detect the classes in training and testing datasets and afterwards dataset has been divided into sub classes concerning the SOM classes. Finally, prediction error of the each class calculated separately. In this experiment the dataset is not split into classes for training but for the error calculation as a post processing. In this investigation the occurrence of each class has been also calculated in order to observe the similarity of occurrence of the classes in training and testing datasets and to detect whether SOM can depict related data points. For a better analysis of the correct detection of the classes, a scatter plot of each class in training and in testing dataset has been figured out; see ANNEX VII Scatter plots of SOM (6x10) . The similarities between classes in training and testing data can be observed. That means SOM detects the related data in training and testing datasets. The second experiment has been done by training an own ANN for each SOM class and predicting the wind power for matching classes separately. For this experiment training and testing datasets are split in classes generated by SOM as a first step and finally ANNs has been trained and used to predict wind power with class owned test data. The predictions of the each classes have been joined together to compare it with results of without a classification. The results for the all wind farms are showed in the following figures. The figures marked with “a” show the occurrence of classes in datasets for each wind farm. It can be seen from the concurrence plots that the occurrence ratio of classes in training and testing dataset states close to each other often; especially at the first classes. But there are some classes for which the ratio in training and testing datasets deviates clearly. As a result, it can be mentioned that SOM can be used in WPF to divide dataset into classes without a detailed meteorological analysis of dataset. The reason of differences between the occurrence ratios can be explained by frequency of weather conditions in training and testing years. The results of the experiments (prediction error of the SOM classes) are illustrated with plots marked with “b”. The results indicated with “Final” (first blue and red columns) shows the final results with combination of all dataset without splitting. In the second experiment the results of each class are joined together to calculate this final result; the first red column on the plots. On these plots the blue columns indicates the first experiment which uses a single ANN for the wind power prediction. It can be clearly seen that the prediction error of classes varies very evidently. For example for alpha ventus the class 39 has 10.98% error while class 55 has 24.09% in terms of nRMSE. For Baltic1 the class 35 is the best class with 6.25% nRMSE and class 1 is the worst one with 33% of prediction error. It could be detected that there are big variations between errors of different classes and this information can be used to have a foreknowledge of prediction error and thus it can help for a better planning of reserve energy. This information can be also used to generate probabilistic predictions. In this case, it is important that the classes of each other following data points do not change very often, otherwise it is difficult to use this information. It was apparent from detected SOM classes that same class number was repeating often at least for a few hours, see Figure 5â13; this means that we can use this data for the above mentioned purposes. The red columns on these plots are representing the results of the second experiment, training each class with own ANN. In this experiment, it is often the case that the training with the class owned data has higher prediction error than training complete data together with a single ANN and afterwards splitting by SOM. It is rarely observed that training with class owned ANN and testing with matching data has better results. For example class 23 at alpha ventus, class 17 at Baltic1, class 11 at Damme and class 31 at Wulfenau delivered better results. This can be result of data minority in classes after dividing and therefore ANN has not enough data to learn the relation between input and output. a) b) Figure 5â16 alpha ventus - a) Occurrence of the SOM classes in training and testing datasets b) Prediction error of each SOM classes a) b) Figure 5â17 Baltic1 - a) Occurrence of the SOM classes in training and testing datasets b) Prediction error of each SOM classes a) b) Figure 5â18 Damme - a) Occurrence of SOM classes in training and testing datasets b) Prediction error of each SOM classes a) b) Figure 5â19 Wulfenau - a) Occurrence of the SOM classes in training and testing datasets b) Prediction error of each SOM classes Analysis of the classes good and bad classes This experiment divides the dataset in two main classes – good classes, bad classes - after calculating the final prediction; this experiment is explained in section 3.6.4 in detail. After generating the good and bad classes with SOM, firstly the error of the both classes are calculated and afterwards for the good and bad class own ANNs have been trained and wind power is predicted with matching data. There are black dotted lines on the figures above marked with “b” in section 5.5.3. This line has the value of the final forecast of the first experiment and it helps to group the classes as better or worse. The classes below of this line belong to good classes and the others above the line belongs to bad classes (considers just blue columns). Table 5â6 contains the results of these experiments. There is approximately 5% difference between good and bad classes. Training an own ANN for the bad classes reduced the prediction error for Baltic1, Damme and Wulfenau, but it has been slightly higher for alpha ventus. In regard to good classes, the training of an own ANN improve the forecast quality very slightly just for alpha ventus, for the other wind farms it has been little bit worse.

Figure 5â20 Results of the good and bad SOM classes in day-ahead wind power forecasting Weekly Development of Wind Power Forecasting Error This investigation deals with the weekly development of the wind power forecast quality for day-ahead wind power forecast via different models in order to analyze the development of the wind power forecast quality from beginning of operation up to one year of operational experience both for offshore and onshore wind farms. In other words, focus of this investigation is to research the development of wind power forecast quality based on availability of the training dataset. Developments of day-ahead wind power forecasts are investigated in the weekly steps via three different models for one year. Hence it represents a roadmap for the decision which forecasting method should be selected for which no, limited or long data available. This experiment becomes especially meaning, if we consider the construction period of high capacity offshore wind farms. Through the results of this experiment – weekly development of wind power forecasting error - we are able to decide which prediction system should be selected during the construction phase of a wind farm. Via three approaches - physical model, physical model extended with MOS and ANN – the wind power generation of the next-day is predicted in each step with different long training periods (weekly extended) and the prediction error of the models in the next-day forecast on a test dataset is determined. The following figures represent the result of the day-ahead forecast. On the diagrams, the physical model is drawn with a blue line, through the MOS optimized physical model with green and the statistical model based on ANN with a red curve. The abscissa indicates the time axis and the ordinate shows the prediction error in terms of nRMSE, i.e. the normalized with nominal power of the wind farms mean square error. Firstly each farms result will be analyzed and then results of onshore and offshore compared in the conclusion. The Figure 5â21 shows the results of alpha ventus. The physical model has a prediction error 18.79% in terms of nRMSE. With the supplement of the MOS the error can be reduced to 17.82% only within a few weeks. The quality of wind power forecast with MOS does not improve so much with extended training dataset. In regard to ANN, the forecast error reduces due to extending the training dataset. From the over 40% nRMSE in the first weeks, it is descending to 17.5% after a half year and with training one year’s data it reaches 17.12% prediction error in terms of nRMSE. There is not so obvious improvement after ca.25 weeks. It means in other words that with availability of ca 25 weeks’ data the ANN can learn the weather situations reliably and it reaches good results. As it from figure can be seen, with availability of 30 weeks data ANN is makes best predictions compared with other prediction models. A list of weekly improvement of forecast quality can be found in ANNEX VI Results in weekly steps. Figure 5â21 Forecast error depending on the length of the training period at alpha ventus Figure 5â22 Weekly development of the day-ahead power forecast error for alpha ventus The results of second offshore wind farm Baltic 1 with extended training dataset is shown in Figure 5â23. Error of the physical model is ca. 19%. This error can be reduced to 18.3% with availability of one year training data via using MOS. At the beginning the forecast error of ANN amounts over 36% and it decreases mainly week by week by extending the training dataset and at the end of 1 year this amount lies about 18% prediction error in terms of nRMSE. Similar to results of alpha ventus MOS extended physical model delivers good results already after a few weeks. For the statistical burn-in ANN requires more than 20 weeks data. ANN is so good like MOS extended model in availability of 28 weeks data and ANN is the best model in availability of 33 weeks data. Figure 5â23 Forecast error depending on the length of the training period at Baltic1 Figure 5â24 Weekly development of the day-ahead power forecast error for Baltic1 The first onshore wind farm Damme has a prediction error with preprocessed physical model 13.8% in terms of nRMSE, which can be seen in Figure 5â25 Forecast error depending on the length of the training period at Damme. With commitment of the MOS this error decreases to 12.7% in availability of 10 weeks data. If we continue to extend data set, the prediction error changes just very slightly. In the first half of the error of ANN varies and it reaches ca. 12.6%. After the first half year a slightly improvement of the prediction quality can be observed and it reaches to 12.07% error in terms of nRMSE for day-ahead power prediction with one year training data, which needed to model the relation of different weather situations and power generation. ANN delivers better power predictions than other methods from 23th week for Damme. Figure 5â25 Forecast error depending on the length of the training period at Damme Figure 5â26 Improvement of day-ahead prediction compared with last result - Damme As to second onshore wind farm Wulfenau, the development of prediction error is similar to first onshore wind farm. The prediction error of the preprocessed physical model amounts about 15.7%, little bit worse than Damme wind farm. With the application of MOS to the physical model this error reduces to ca. 14.7% in the first week and has an improvement over 1% end on one month, which amounts 13.6% error in terms of nRMSE. Next to that there are not big changes in the prediction error and it reaches 13.5% error at the end of one year. Till 23th week the prediction error of ANN goes down mostly and it reaches ca. 13.5% prediction error. After that it varies just slightly and finally training with one year data the prediction error lands to 12.4%. The result of ANN is from 24th week not any more worse compared with MOS extended physical model. Figure 5â27 Forecast error depending on the length of the training period at Wulfenau Figure 5â28 Improvement of day-ahead prediction compared with last result – Wulfenau The prediction quality of the physical model does not change with extended availability of data. This is an expected result since no historical data is used for an optimization of this model. This model is evaluated directly with testing dataset. If the physical model supplemented by a MOS, the wind power prediction will be improved from the first week. After a few weeks this extended model achieves satisfied results. The ANN as a statistical model provides after half a year reliable results, i.e. requires half a year training data to learn the weather situations reliably. In a historical data set with a length of half a year, the quality of the statistical model is as good as that of the physical model with MOS. In a further extension of the training period better power predictions can be achieved with neural networks than the MOS extended physical model. Especially for new built offshore wind farms, for which the historical data are partly or no available, it is useful to resort during the first thirty weeks on a physical modeling approach and this extend with a MOS model. After this time to a historical record of at least seven months available stands the statistical model gives better results. Following table shows the methods and suggested prediction model for onshore and offshore wind farms. Table 5â7 Selection of prediction method for onshore and offshore wind farms Onshore Offshore MOS extended Physical Model < 6 months < 7 months Artificial Neural Networks >= 6 months >= 7 months Variation of prediction error with ANN dependent from hidden neurons and different training periods In this investigation the variation of power prediction error is analyzed with two experiments. The first one is focused on the structure of ANN, while the second one on dataset from different periods of the year. Because of its startup initialization and wide parameterization possibilities like hidden layer size, hide node count, training algorithm etc., output of ANN varies at each repeating new model run. In this study only the influence of different hidden nodes on wind power prediction is analyzed. In the second experiment ANN is trained with weekly, monthly and seasonally data, in order to seek the variation and the dependency of wind power forecasting on training dataset from different periods of the year. Two years data is used for this experiment and divided differently for each experiment correspondingly. First year’s data is used for training and second year’s data for the evaluation of ANN. Different count of hidden neuron As it mentioned above there are different parameters to set ANN up. This experiment focused on the variation of the prediction error in DAF by parameterization of ANN with increased count of hidden neurons. The size of hidden nodes has been changed between 1 and 12. Each experiment of every different hidden node has been repeated 10 times with using same dataset. This experiment is presented here for one offshore and one onshore wind farm. While Figure 5â29 illustrates the results for alpha ventus, Figure 5â30 shows results of Wulfenau. Figure 5â29 Variability of prediction error with changed hidden neurons for alpha ventus Figure 5â30 Variability of prediction error with changed hidden neuron for Wulfenau As can be seen from figures above, the prediction error varies with changing count of the hidden neuron and also at each new model run for both onshore and offshore wind farms. Minimum prediction error of DAF at alpha ventus is achieved with 5 hidden neurons and at Wulfenau it was possible with 7 hidden neurons. The results of alpha ventus varied between 17.1% and 18.15% and thus difference between best and worst results amounts for alpha ventus ca. 1%. As to Wulfenau the error of best prediction is 12.4% and worst one got with 8 nodes 13.6% in terms of nRMSE and difference is also close to 1.2%. It is very obvious from the results that the correct parameterization of ANN is important and just with changing the hidden neuron it could improve prediction error ~10% and a pre-analysis is essential to set ANN with correct parameters. Seasonal analysis of the wind power forecasting with ANN For the understanding of the prediction error variation with seasonal data, different experiments are performed. Following diagram illustrates the overview of data allocation for the training and evaluation of ANN based on seasonal data. In this research mainly 5 different experiments are realized. It should be noted here that for this investigation year begins with beginning spring and ends with end of winter. The first experiment uses just one season’s data for the training of ANN and data from same the season from following year is used to evaluate the ANN; in other words training and evaluation is done with same seasons of sequenced years. In the second experiment, ANN is trained each time only one seasons data and its’ evaluation done with one complete year’s dataset. This experiment helps to understand which season can better represents the complete 4 season, i.e. which season comprises different weather conditions of whole year. In contrast to second experiment, the third experiment uses the complete dataset of the first year completely for the training and the seasonal data from the second year is used to evaluate the neural network. This should indicate in which season the wind power forecast is better compared with others in availability of one year training data. The winter data is excluded from the dataset in the fourth experiment. For the evaluation the complete second year’s data is used. So we can see what happens if we exclude winter data and influence of it on wind power prediction error. The fifth experiment is similar with the fourth one but the winter data is also excluded from evaluation data. These experiments and their result are discussed in following sub sections numbered also on the diagram with characters. d c b a Figure 5â31 Data allocation for the seasonal research of prediction error Training and evaluation with seasonal data In this investigation ANN is trained with data of just one season from selected training year and it is evaluated with data of same season from the evaluation year. That means if ANN is trained with spring data, it will be evaluated with spring data from the evaluation dataset and similar for other seasons of the year. The results of this investigation are plotted in following figures. The figure on the left shows the results of each season in terms of nRMSE. “1 year” parameter on this figure means that the training and evaluation covers complete years, 1 year training and 1 year evaluation. This figure reveals that for both onshore and offshore wind farms ANN could reflect well in spring, despite of higher wind speeds. If we consider the lower mean speeds in summer, the prediction error of wind power would be also lower which we can see at onshore wind farms but it was not the case for alpha ventus, sure this assumption changes for locations and years. Surprisingly, in autumn the prediction error of alpha ventus reaches minimum. In contrast to alpha ventus, the onshore farms have worse prediction quality with autumn data. The prediction error is with winter data higher than 1 year data for all wind farms as a result of higher mean speed in this season. It must be noted that this experiment uses just seasonal data for both training and evaluation, therefore the results of power prediction depends on the characteristic of seasons in training and evaluation years. The second figure illustrates the deviation of the prediction error from “1 year” result. The biggest difference is observed in autumn at alpha ventus with ca. 2.5%. For the onshore farms the wind power prediction with autumn and with winter data deviates more than spring and summer. Figure 5â32 Training and evaluation with seasonal data- nRMSE of each season (left) and deviation from 1 year’s result (right) The results of this experiment are useful to measure the relationship of same season of difference years and therefore the influence of it on the wind power prediction. Training with seasonal data, testing with 1 year data In order to learn the relationship between the numerical weather predictions and the wind power, ANN uses seasonal data as input and it is evaluated then with yearly data comprises four seasons. This experiment aims to see which season of the year can represent a complete year better. It can be seen from figures below that the result of onshore and offshore farms are basically similar with training just one season’s data and whatever season it is, the prediction quality is not better than training with 1 year complete data, see figure on the right. It means that one season’s data is not enough to figure out the complete year with ANN. Figure 5â33 Training ANN with seasonal data, evaluate with 1 year data – Results of seasons (left) and comparison with one year training (right) Especially, training with spring or autumn data and testing ANN with data of complete year is noticeable. The prediction error is especially lower, if we train ANN with spring or autumn data. A possible explanation for this might be that these transition seasons contain most of different weather conditions including which can be faced in summer or winter and the result of these seasons are closer to 1 year’s result. In contrast to spring and autumn, summer and winter prediction errors are higher. The biggest deviation with ca. 7% is observed in summer at Wulfenau. This discrepancy could be attributed to same reason that these seasons contain mainly season typical conditions not the conditions of transition seasons and the wind speed is lower that other seasons of the year. Training with 1 year data, testing with seasonal data In this experiment, ANN is trained with one complete year’s data and it is evaluated with seasonal data from evaluation dataset. This experiment helps to compare prediction error of seasons of the year means in which season the wind power forecast is higher compared with others. At alpha ventus the highest prediction error is observed in winter, as to onshore farms it is in autumn. All wind farms have good results in spring and the spring results are better than 1 year results for all. The prediction quality of Damme is best in summer, while results of the other wind farms aggravated compared with spring. The lowest discrepancy between 1 year’s result and seasonal results is seen in summer for alpha ventus and for onshore farms in winter. The results show that the prediction error of onshore and offshore wind farms differs in seasons. This experiment should be repeated with data from several years in order to see whether this result is general or just for selected years for this study. Figure 5â34 Training with 1 year data and evaluating with seasonal data Training with excluded one season, testing with 1 year data In this experiment, at every new model run one season of the year is excluded from dataset for the training of ANN and the evaluation is done with complete 1 year data. In other words, training is done with 3 seasons’ data and evaluation with 4 seasons. As an additional research, winter data is excluded from both training and evaluation datasets, depicted with “winter out” on the following diagrams. Excluding one season’s data from training dataset results not big changes on prediction error. An exception of this result is spring data of alpha ventus, which worsens the results. If we have spring and autumn out, the quality of prediction error for onshore farms is very slightly better. The results of these experiments corroborates with the finding of the experiment which analyses the weekly development of prediction error. The result of mentioned experiment was “at least 25-30 week long training dataset to get reliable results with ANN” and in this experiment we have already more than 30 weeks training data. Excluding winter data from both training and testing dataset has not a considerable effect on prediction error. Figure 5â35 Training with excluded one season each time and evaluation with 1 year data Variation of wind power prediction error with monthly data This experiment is similar with experiment “b” of the seasonal investigation of wind power prediction error. In this one, the allocation of training dataset is extended and ANN is trained each time just with one month data and it is evaluated with data of a complete year. Another difference is that this experiments starts with data of January. It means that in total twelve different ANN is trained for this experiment and the results of this investigation can be seen separately for onshore and offshore wind farms in following diagrams. The boxplots on the right illustrate the median (central mark), the 25th and 75th percentiles (edges of the box), the whiskers indicating variability outside the quartiles, and the outliers (red pluses). Figure 5â36 Training of ANN with monthly data - Offshore wind farms It is very obvious that prediction error changes with selected month for training. Prediction error of alpha ventus varied between ca. 22% and 34.5% in terms of nRMSE. Best prediction is done for this wind farm with data of December. The prediction error reaches highest value with data of March and April. The prediction error of Baltic1 is varying between 23% and 37% in terms of nRMSE. The best prediction is done with data of October and the worst one is with November data. Figure 5â37 Training of ANN with monthly data – Onshore wind farms Both of two onshore wind farms have low prediction errors with training with January data. While Damme has the best prediction with data of February, Wulfenau has its worst predictions with data of same month. The prediction error of Damme is varying between 14% and 22.5%; for Wulfenau it is between 14.5% and 22% in terms of nRMSE. It should be noted that with extended allocation of training dataset the influence of null values in data stands out clearly; it can drive higher prediction errors because of decreased training data. Prediction error in months of the year by training with 1 year data After training ANN with 1 year’s complete data, the prediction error of each month of the year from evaluation data has been analyzed. For this experiment, an additional training of has not been done, the final results of one year training has been divided in months and the prediction error of each month is calculated. The results of onshore and offshore wind farms are illustrated separately in Figure 5â39. Both onshore farms and alpha ventus are higher prediction error in winter months, especially in January the prediction error is high for all wind farms. For onshore wind farms, the prediction error is also high in months of autumn. For Wulfenau the prediction of April was as bad as January. Both onshore wind farms have good predictions in March and August. The prediction in March is good for alpha ventus as well. The prediction quality is also high in July for alpha ventus. Figure 5â38 Prediction error of onshore farms in months of the year by training with 1 year data Figure 5â39 Prediction error of alpha ventus in months of the year by training with 1 year data Variation of wind power prediction error with weekly data In this investigation, it is proceeded to extend the allocation of training data. For each week of the year an own ANN is trained. For the evaluation the ANNs one complete year’s data is used. In other words, totally 52 different neural network is trained for the weeks of the year in this experiment. As can be observed from the plots below, the prediction error of training with different weeks of the year varies too much. The error best prediction of alpha ventus is 15% and the worst one is about 35% in terms of nRMSE, thus the discrepancy between best and worst prediction is 20%. As to Baltic1 the discrepancy is higher than alpha ventus, the best power prediction has an error of ca. 21% and the worst one is approximately 51%. Figure 5â40 Training of ANN with weekly data – Offshore wind farms Similar to offshore wind farms, high variations can be observed on the prediction errors of onshore wind farms. The prediction errors vary between 15% and 35% for Damme and for Wulfenau it is between 14.6% and 42% in terms of nRMSE. Figure 5â41 Training of ANN with weekly data – Onshore wind farms An obvious and natural result of training with seasonal, monthly or weekly dataset is that by extended allocation (less data at each following experiment) of training dataset the span prediction error improves and be worse. It is a result of decreased availability of training dataset which is needed to learn the relation between meteorological predictions and power generation of the wind farms. Prediction error in weeks of the year by training with 1 year data In this investigation an analysis of the weekly variation of prediction error by training ANN with 1 year data is done. An additional training of ANN has not been done; the final results of one year training have been divided in weeks and error of each week is calculated. The results are illustrated in following figures. It is possible to extract information from the results about the variation of prediction error, but it is difficult get any further information like determination of weeks of years in which prediction is especially good. While the prediction error of Damme varies between ca. 6% and 19.5%, Wulfenau’s prediction error lies between 7.8% and 19% in terms of nRMSE. The prediction error of alpha ventus varies in a wider range; namely between 8.1% and 25.8%. Figure 5â42 Prediction error in weeks of the year by training with 1 year data Integration of atmospheric stability in wind power forecast In this investigation, firstly, the Gradient Richardson Number (GRN) is calculated and afterwards it is used as additional input to other meteorological parameters in order to train neural networks. Next, dataset is divided into the stability classes determined by using GRN. These classes are used not just as additional parameter to train ANN and also for each class an own ANN is trained. The error analysis of each class is also done. The experiments in this section are conducted without Baltic1; because there was no data available for this wind farm in order to run the experiments of this investigation. As it addressed above, the stability classes of the wind farms calculated based on GRN are shown in following figure. While at alpha ventus very unstable conditions are dominating, for onshore parks stable weather conditions are in majority. Because of the temperature of the water, different weather conditions are prevailing on the see that can be also seen in this figure. Figure 5â43 Occurrence of the stability classes based on GRN Gradient Richardson Number as additional input In this investigation, three different experiments are implemented to answer whether the atmospheric stability helps to improve the wind power prediction. The first experiment uses the GRN as an additional input for the training of ANN, while the second one uses atmospheric stability class number as additional input. The third experiment combines the results of separately trained classes together for a final power forecast. Figure 5â44 shows the results of these experiments. From the chart above, it can be seen that there is not an obvious decrement of prediction error. None of three experiments could improve the prediction quality at alpha ventus. ANN could not get any distinctive information from GRN or from stability classes and it could not result with improved forecasts. As to onshore wind farms, applying GRN or stability class as additional input, a very slight improvement can be achieved. Training own ANN for each stability class and afterwards combining the results together could bring highest improvement of power prediction at Wulfenau. Figure 5â44 Atmospheric stability parameter as additional input in wind power forecast Error analysis of stability classes After determining the atmospheric stability classes, the dataset is divided into classes and the prediction error of each class is calculated separately. This operation is repeated for each experiment defined above in section 5.8.1. The following diagram illustrates the results of five stability classes for each wind farm and each experiment. The prediction quality the very stable classes are often the best compared with the results of other stability classes for both offshore and onshore farms. The results of very unstable classes are remarkable for onshore farms. While the worst results for alpha ventus are got from stable class, it was for onshore farms the neutral class. The unstable classes have the second worst results for both offshore and onshore farms. Figure 5â45 DAF error of each stability classes Ensemble physical wind power forecasting Different studies showed that the combination of different power forecasts can reduce the forecast error. [24] and also [79] showed that the combination of power forecast done with ensemble members of MS-EPS model reduces the forecast error, which has been done with two different methods, a simple average and also with 2ANN approach. Multi-NWP approach improves also the wind power forecast quality. The multi-NWP approach firstly predicts the wind power with each available weather forecast from different weather forecasting services or models and then it merges these power forecasts together and so calculates the final forecast. In this study, the power output of alpha ventus is predicted with seven different members of PEPS model. The physical model is used to predict wind power with each ensemble member separately and finally the average of these seven power predictions is calculated. Similar to above called studies, a simple combination of power predictions done with different ensemble members of weather predictions derives an improvement the power forecast. In this study, the combined prediction is ca. 3% better than the best ensemble member’s power prediction. While the single members vary between 20.71% and 29.29%, the combination model has 18.39% prediction error in terms of nRMSE. Figure 5â46 shows the result of ensemble members and the combination of the single members. In this study any other further investigation of ensemble predictions systems has been researched. But different studies and also this experiment show that via the combination of predictions, done with different ensemble members or NWPs, the wind power prediction can be improved via simple methods without high effort. Figure 5â46 Ensemble physical forecasting model Conclusions and Outlook As a result of increasing penetration of weather dependent renewable energy producers like wind and solar energy, the requirement for innovative tools improves day by day to manage these fluctuating and decentralized energy resources. The high volatility of energy production threats the grid stability and therefore complete energy supply. There are already developed tools to improve the controllability of wind energy and to make it more plannable. One of the most important of these tools concerning wind energy is surely the wind power prediction tools, predicts expected power from wind source, is indispensable to improve the penetration of wind energy in the energy mix and accuracy of it plays a major role in the grid reliability, need for balancing energy and hence the cost of wind power integration; shortly to make it profitable and manageable. This role will be progressively important with focus on the additional planned onshore and offshore wind farms. There are also cluster management tools, which are combining wind turbines or wind farms to manage them like conventional power plants. Because of higher potential of wind on the sea, the offshore wind energy is a promising source in order to achieve climate change targets and to control global warming. Therefore this study is focused on wind power prediction of offshore wind energy in German waters. It is especially significant if we consider the additional planned German offshore wind farms in the Baltic and North Sea. In the next years the planned 15 GW of offshore wind power requires a better understanding of offshore WPF and improvement of it. In this study, wind power prediction systems for first two German offshore wind farms – alpha ventus and Baltic1 - and two onshore wind farms – Damme and Wulfenau - have been developed and the results are discussed. A physical model has been developed which is called WAPPM; firstly to simulate the power output of a wind farm in case of unavailability of power measurements. This model needs some specific information of the wind farm and environment of the farm. In the RAVE-Grid Integration project, this model is used to simulate power generation (complete wind farm and each turbine’s power output) of first German offshore wind farm alpha ventus and this simulated power data has been used in different tasks of the RAVE Grid Integration project. Meteorological measurements from met-mast FINO1 are used to realize the simulation, which must be evaluated and corrected before using it. The main advantage of the physical model is that it does not require any historical data. But detailed information of farm and turbines, especially power curves and the locations of the turbines are very relevant for this model. After this model proved its quality, it was used to predict wind power forecast with NWP data. To consider wake losses in wind farms Jensen’s wake model is used. This wake model is easy to implement and works well, but there are different models to estimate wake effects. As a further work different wake methods can be implemented and maybe that derive an improvement of physical model. If the physical model is supplemented by a statistical correction method, the systematic errors can be reduced and thus the forecast quality can be improved. For the application of MOS we need historical data of NWP and power measurements from wind farms. Different MOS methods are applied and prediction error is thence reduced. As a pure statistical model ANN is investigated in this study. This learning approach is also used to realize different investigations. ANN needs to be trained with historical data in order to learn the relation between power generation and numerical weather predictions. This approach provides best reliable results in availability of enough historical training data. In addition to basic prediction methods mentioned above, different combinations of these methods are investigated, called hybrid models, which basically combines the physical model with statistical correction methods and ANN. The aim of this investigation is research of improvement of the prediction quality by using advantages of different approaches. By applying some of these models it was possible to improve the prediction quality slightly. The results of experiments are showed that the higher wind speeds on the see derives also higher prediction errors of offshore wind farms compared with onshore ones. On one hand the rapid wind power build-out continues, a large number of new wind farms will come online but on the other hand forecasters and forecasting algorithms have little experience with them. This is a problem for statistical short term forecasts, which must be trained on a long record of historical power production - exactly what is missing for a new farm. This data is necessary to describe the relation between meteorological predictions and power generation of wind farms. This study emphasized the question which prediction approach should be selected dependent on available historical data to get reliable wind power predictions. This question gets more importance if we consider longer construction times of higher capacity offshore wind farms. In order to answer this question, development of the prediction quality is researched by extending training data in weekly steps. The result of physical model is not relative to training dataset, because this approach is not related with a learning process. The statistical correction applied to physical model provides reliable results even in availability of a few weeks’ historical power data available. ANN delivers not the best results with less training data; it requires at least ca. 25-30 weeks training data in order to learn different weather conditions and if so much historical data is available, ANN is best prediction method for wind power forecasting. If we continue to extend the training dataset, we cannot see so much improvement of prediction quality with ANN like with training in first 25-30 weeks. To conclude, if we have more than a half year for onshore and seven months for offshore historical data, ANN should be selected as prediction method; otherwise the physical model extended with MOS delivers reliable results and should be applied as prediction method. The results of this investigation emphasize also the importance of collecting and storing the historical data from the perspective of advanced wind power forecasting in order to formulate the relation between wind power and numerical weather predictions better and thus to reduce wind power prediction errors. SOM is one of most used type of artificial neural networks used for organization and discrete representation of various features of a complex data. In this study, application of SOM in wind power forecasting is investigated. SOM classes and SOM vector are used as additional input for the training of ANN. But the findings are showed that this additional input does not help to reduce the prediction error. In a follow up experiment dataset is split into groups based on detected SOM classes; firstly every class is evaluated and then each class has been trained separately with an own ANN. It could be detected that there are big variations between errors of classes and this information can be used to have a foreknowledge of the prediction error. This information can be also used to generate probabilistic predictions. In this case, it is important that the classes of following data points do not change very often, otherwise it is difficult to use this information. It was apparent from detected SOM classes that same class number was repeating often at least for a few hours; this means that we can use this data for the above mentioned purposes. As to train and evaluate each class separately, it could be observed that some classes have better prediction quality if we train an own ANN. In the last experiment, dataset was split into two groups, good and bad classes, and each class trained with own ANN and evaluated. Unfortunately, a systematic improvement of prediction quality could not be achieved. Another research topic of this study is the variation of the wind power prediction error. It was focused on two reasons prediction error variability; structure of ANN and availability of dataset. The hidden node count of ANN is increased 1 to 12 step by step and repeated each time with 10 model reruns. The results of this experiment showed that the optimal count of hidden neurons differs from farm to farm and the variations at reruns of different nodes are differently; it is varying up to 1% between best and worse results. As to available dataset experiments, variation of the prediction error is analyzed with seasonal, monthly and weekly datasets. In addition to evaluation of partial data, training with divided datasets is implemented. Especially focused on seasonal analysis of prediction error and mainly 5 different experiments are carried out. Integration of the atmospheric stability is also researched in this work. GRN is estimated and with using this parameter the atmospheric stability classes are detected. GRN and stability classes are used as additional input to train ANN. It was possible to reduce the prediction error very slightly with this additional information both for onshore and offshore farms. Dataset was split in classes based on stability classes and each class was trained separately which helped also to improve prediction quality slightly for one onshore wind farm. The prediction error of each class is calculated and it has been seen that the prediction error of neutral classes was higher than other for onshore farms and for alpha ventus it was the stable class. Very stable and very unstable classes had better predictions for both onshore and offshore wind farms. It was already known that the prediction error can be reduced by combining power predictions done with using different NWPs or different ensemble members. In this study different PEPS members are used to predict power generation with physical model. Afterwards these predictions are combined by simple averaging and the final result was better than results of single predictions and thus it could be validated that the combination of different power predictions has the potential for the improvement of final forecast. In this study different combination methods are not investigated. A further improvement can be possible by implementing feature selection or different combination methods. As it is mentioned many times in this study, higher capacity of weather dependent energy producers at the same time means higher fluctuations of energy production, which is a big risk for grid stability and can cause a blackout of complete energy supply. In order to keep the electricity grid stable, it is important to consider other renewable energy sources like biomass, geothermal energy, hydropower, combined heat and power (CHP) systems, which are not fluctuating with changing weather conditions and provides more controllability, thus complement fluctuating wind and solar energy. The energy system should be designed correspondingly and not just on national level, but also considering neighbor countries. For EU, it means that making renewable energy regulations by taking the renewable energy installations in all EU countries and effects on others into account.

ANNEX I Workflow of WAPPM Workflows of Wake Adjusted Physical Power Model WAPPM in turbine and farm levels The main window of WAPPM is shown below. The users can load an existing wind from the wind farm list; and can also define a new one by using new wind farm button. After loading a wind farm, the next step is importing a dataset which includes wind data in different heights. If the wind speed is not in hub height, user has the possibility to calculate it with different methods by considering or ignoring wake effects. RUN button is to calculate the final energy production by considering options selected before. Wind farm window helps to define new farms, which will be available also in future runs. User can gives detailed information of wind farms. Users can select different types of wind turbines with different hub heights. Rotor diameter and other details of wind turbines can be defined by creating new type wind turbines. Wind turbine manager contains a list of the predefined wind turbines. It is possible to delete one from the list or define a new wind turbine. Following window is to define a new turbine. Power, ct and PQ curves can be given and at the same time can be seen on plots at right side. Other technical details of wind turbine can be injected by this window. ANNEX II Locations of the wind farms This Annex includes the locations of wind farms on Germany map and layouts of these wind farms. Following figure shows locations of the wind farms alpha-ventus, Baltic1, Damme, and Wulfenau on the Google map. Following figures illustrates the layouts on wind farms. The blue points on the graphics are assigned for the wind turbines. These figures should only give an idea about layout of the wind farms and arrangement of wind turbines on them. It must be considered that original wind farm layout is not exact downscaled and coordinates of wind farms or distances between them should not extracted from these figures. ANNEX III Algorithm of nominal power detection Work flow of nominal power detection in availability of met-mast data Initialize nominal PW with maximum measured PW Read corrected WS and measured PW Calculate ratio between meas. PW and installed PW Detect data points, where PW is small in spite of high WS Find boundaries for this sector and correct manually Assign max PW of this sector as ins.
