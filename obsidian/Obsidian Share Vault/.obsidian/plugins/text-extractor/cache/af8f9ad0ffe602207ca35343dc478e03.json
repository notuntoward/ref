This is partially due to an increasing share of renewable energy, wind and photovoltaic, which requires power generators to balance out the forecasting errors in their production. We investigate the bidding behaviour in the intraday market by looking at both last prices and continuous bidding, in the context of a fundamental model. A unique data set of 15-minute intraday prices and intraday-updated forecasts of wind and photovoltaic has been employed and price bids are modelled by prior informa- tion on fundamentals. We show that intraday prices adjust asymmetrically to both forecasting errors in renewables and to the volume of trades dependent on the threshold variable demand quote, which reﬂects the expected demand covered by the planned traditional capacity in the day-ahead market. The location of the threshold can be used by market participants to adjust their bids accordingly, given the latest updates in the wind and photovoltaic fore- casting errors and the forecasts of the control area balances.

Introduction1 Trading in the intraday electricity markets increased rapidly since the2 opening of the market. This may be driven by the need of photovoltaic and3 wind power operators to balance their production forecast errors, i.e. devia-4 tions between forecasted and actual production. Evidence for this is a jump5 in the volume of intraday trading as the direct marketing of renewable energy6 was introduced. Furthermore, there may be a generally increased interest in7 intraday trading activities due to proprietary trading. We study the struc-8 ture of intraday trading of electricity and identify the price-driving factors.9 Our main goal is to identify market fundamental factors that inﬂuence the10 bidding behavior in the 15-minute intraday market at the European Power11 Exchange (EPEX).12 Along the basic timeline of electricity trading activities, see Figure 1, the13 intraday activities relate mostly to further adjustments of positions after the14 closure of the day-ahead market.15 Figure 1: Timing Electricity Trading While day-ahead trading oﬀers the possibility to correct the long-term16 production schedule (build on the forward markets) in terms of hourly pro-17 duction schedule of power plants (Delta Hedging) and to adjust for the resid-18 ual load proﬁles on an hourly basis, the increasing share of renewable energy19 sources (wind, solar) in electricity markets requires a ﬁner adjustment.20 According to the Equalization Mechanism Ordinance (ger.: Verordnung21 zur Weiterentwicklung des bundesweiten Ausgleichsmechanismus, abbr.:22 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 AuglMechV) all electricity generated by renewable sources has to be traded23 day-ahead. This is usually done by the transmission system operator (TSO)24 with the plant operator receiving a legally guaranteed feed-in-tariﬀ. From25 2012 on the inclusion of a market premium led direct marketers within the26 feed-in premium support scheme to enter the market as well. Trading of elec-27 tricity from a renewable energy source is based on forecasts which may have28 a horizon of up to 36 h (taking some data-handling into account). To correct29 errors in forecasts the AusglMechV requires the marketers of renewable en-30 ergy to use the intraday market to balance diﬀerences in actual and updated31 forecasts. Intraday trading starts at 3 pm and takes place continuously until32 up to 30 min before the start of the traded quarter-hour. As forecasts change33 regularly, marketers may sell and buy the same contract at diﬀerent times34 during the trading period.35 After the closure of the intraday market balancing energy has to be used36 to close diﬀerences between available and forecasted electricity. As a smaller37 number of power plants are used for balancing energy the merit-order curve38 is steeper than that in the intraday market. Thus on average larger prices39 are paid and marketers aim at minimising this diﬀerence, see [5]. In addition,40 TSOs may impose sanctions on marketers who frequently require balancing41 energy.42 Balancing energy is supplied by generators with the necessary ﬂexibility to43 balance the market. In case generation is below demand positive balancing44 energy is used, otherwise negative balancing energy. [6] and [13] contain45 a detailed description of the integration of renewable energy in electricity46 markets and the regulatory requirements and we refer the reader to these47 sources for further information.48 The day-ahead market (spot market) and the balancing markets have49 been investigated extensively. For example, [22] show that the day-ahead50 price formation process at EPEX depends on the interaction/substitution51 eﬀect between the traditional production capacity (coal, gas, oil) with the52 ﬂuctuant renewable energies (wind and photovoltaic (PV)). Further empirical53 studies on intraday/balancing markets include [1], [16]. Also, [18] studies54 strategic behaviour linking day-ahead and balancing markets.55 An investigation in the merit-order eﬀect is given by [2], who ﬁnd that56 electricity generation by wind and PV has reduced spot market prices con-57 siderably by 6 e/MWh in 2010 rising to 10 e/MWh in 2012. They also show58 that merit order eﬀects are projected to reach 14-16 e/MWh in 2016.59 Recent studies of the intraday high-frequency electricity prices at EPEX60 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 are [8] and [9] who look at liquidity eﬀects and forecast determinants on a61 hourly basis. Also, [3] considers trading strategies to minimise costs from62 imbalances for both PV and wind, but generates price changes in terms of a63 reduced-form model (using a stochastic process). The focus lies in develop-64 ing a trading strategy for a given setting, and not on explaining the relevant65 price process. Several studies have discussed the eﬀects of prognosis errors66 for wind generation (see [15] and [20]). As Figure 2 suggests, a PV pro-67 duction introduces quarter-hour ramps quite naturally. In addition, changes68 in forecasts of renewable energy production require a timely correction of69 day-ahead positions. However, photovoltaic has not been investigated so far.70 Figure 2: Quarter Hour Ramps [8] and [9] used the ex-post published wind infeed data to explain ex-ante71 their impact on the day-ahead market. These are publicly available data72 from the Transparency Platform EPEX. However, the actual infeed is only73 known ex-post and therefore it cannot be used directly to explain the price74 formation on the intraday market. In fact, the intraday market participants75 have access to updated forecasts of wind. In our study, we will extend the76 existing literature by taking into account the intraday updated forecasts for77 wind and PV, which have been supplied by EWE Trading GmbH.78 Each day, hourly day-ahead electricity prices are revealed around 2 pm79 at EPEX (see [23]). At the same time, market participants have access to80 forecasts for wind and PV published by each Transmission System Operator81 (TSO) in 15-minute intervals for the next day. However, wind and PV fore-82 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 casts are updated frequently during the trading period. Thus, at the time83 when market participants place their bids for a particular intraday delivery84 period (hour, quarter of hour), updated information about the forecasting85 errors of renewables becomes available. In consequence, also deviations be-86 tween the intraday prices and the day-ahead price for a speciﬁc hour are87 expected to occur. Our main research question is, thus, to which extent do88 market participants change their bidding behavior when new information on89 wind and PV forecasts becomes available. We will employ a unique data set90 of the latest forecasts of wind and PV available at the time of the bid.91 Our analysis is twofold: Firstly, we derive an asymmetric fundamental92 model for the diﬀerence between the last price bid for a certain quarter of93 hour and the day-ahead price for that hour. We distinguish between sum-94 mer/winter, peak/oﬀ-peak hours. We test for asymmetric behavior of prices95 to forecasting errors of renewable energy dependent on the demand quote96 regime and investigate further the typical zigzag pattern of intraday prices.97 Thus, we identify a seasonality shape that provides traders important infor-98 mation about the time of the day when they can bid, dependent on their99 demand/supply proﬁles. Furthermore, the eﬀect of volume of trades/market100 liquidity is investigated. Secondly, we are interested in the bidding behavior101 of market participants in the continuous intraday electricity market. We thus102 analyse the continuous trades and disentangle the eﬀect of market fundamen-103 tals dependent on the time of the day. The econometric model is replicated104 for several traded hourly quarters, at diﬀerent time of the day. In particular,105 we are interested to see how delta bid prices change when new information106 becomes available in the intraday renewable forecasts for wind and PV. We107 look at the trade-oﬀ between autoregressive terms and fundamental factors108 impacting the intraday price formation process.109 Our contribution to the existing literature is twofold: we use ex-ante fore-110 casts of fundamental variables and employ high-frequency intraday prices for111 speciﬁc quarter hours. Overall, our paper aims at understanding historically112 the continuous bidding in the intraday market, and proposes a one-period113 forecasting model based on fundamental variables which are observed by114 market participants at the time of the bid. We show that estimation re-115 sults are stable over time, but it is highly relevant to reestimate the model116 separately for summer/winter, peak/oﬀ-peak periods. We benchmark our117 model by an autoregressive model and show that the price formation pro-118 cess is rather driven by market fundamentals, especially for mid-day delivery119 periods. The list of market fundamentals includes expected demand, an ag-120 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 gregate index for the power plant availability including traditional capacity121 planned day-ahead, the volume of trades, control area balances, and intraday122 updated forecasting errors of wind and photovoltaic. Demand/supply side123 factors have been extensively used in the literature and proven to be market124 fundamentals which inﬂuence the electricity price formation process in both125 day-ahead and intraday markets (see [1], [22]). However, as motivated above,126 this is the ﬁrst study which includes ex-ante updates in forecasting errors of127 renewable energies. This study proves that intraday updated forecasts of128 wind and PV are market fundamentals: we show that market participants129 access updated forecasts in renewables to have more private information and130 thus to bid more accurately.131 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we explain the132 modeling assumptions. Sections 3 and 4 show the data used as input and the133 theoretical model. Section 5 proceeds with the formulation of our speciﬁc134 model. Results and their interpretation are given in Section 6 and Section 7135 concludes.136 2. Model architecture137 Our main assumption is that the electricity intraday price formation pro-138 cess depends on how much traditional capacity has been allocated in the139 day-ahead market and in which proportion it covers the forecasted demand.140 Let us consider two possible market regimes:141 1. The traditional capacity planned for the day-ahead satisﬁes the ex-142 pected demand for a certain hour;143 2. There is a certain demand quote uncovered by the planned capacity.144 Thus, in scenario 2, negative forecasting errors of wind and PV will increase145 faster the intraday prices than in scenario 1, due to the excess demand pres-146 sure. Viceversa, in scenario 1, positive forecasting errors in renewables will147 put pressure on traditional suppliers to reduce the production, since renew-148 ables are fed into the grid with priority (on average, 20% of electricity pro-149 duction in Germany is wind and PV based). Thus, prices will decrease faster150 than in scenario 2, where the excess of renewables (positive updated fore-151 casts) will balance out the excess demand. Therefore, in the context of a152 threshold model, we investigate whether there is an asymmetric adjustment153 of the intraday prices to forecasting errors in renewables, dependent on the154 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 demand quote regime (proportion of the forecasted demand for electricity155 in the planned traditional capacity for the day-ahead). The location of the156 threshold in the demand quote is estimated and this gives an indication of the157 bidding behavior in the intraday market. Market participants can compare158 the historically derived threshold value to the currently computed forecasted159 demand quote for a certain hour to identify the market regime and to further160 deﬁne a bidding strategy.161 Employing the demand quote as threshold variable is supported by the162 literature as several papers have found that total electricity demand inﬂu-163 ences price behaviour strongly. In [14] it is shown that the ratio between164 wind and conventional power production aﬀects the electricity price most165 (the so-called wind penetration). [19] identify the residual load, the electric-166 ity demand that needs to be met by conventional power, as an important167 variable.168 To include the trading volume as fundamental variable is also supported169 by the literature, as e.g. [6] ﬁnd that the forecast balancing costs in intraday170 trading are linked to the trading volume. This is in line with earlier papers,171 such as [17] and [4], who estimate asymmetric GARCH models and include172 traded electricity volume in the variance equation to study its impact on173 price volatility.174 In a ﬁrst part of our analysis, we aim at a model for the diﬀerence between175 the last intraday bid price for a certain quarter of an hour and the day-ahead176 price for that speciﬁc hour. As a prerequisite for our modeling approach, we177 investigate the typical zigzag pattern of the 15-minute intraday prices and178 control for seasonality. Figures 3 and 4 show the long-term mean of last prices179 and average prices bid for a certain quarter of an hour between 01/01/2014–180 01/07/2014 for peak and oﬀ peak hours, respectively. During the day, the181 zigzag pattern is mainly explained by the following situation: Renewable182 energy providers sell day-ahead the full hour (average of all quarters). In the183 ﬁrst part of the day, up to 1400, as the sun goes up, there is a buy-pressure on184 them in the ﬁrst quarter as they are not able to produce the hourly average185 (see Figure 3, upper graph). On the other hand, in the fourth quarter they186 produce too much and have to sell. By contrary, in the second part of the187 day (between 1400–2000) the ramping down eﬀect of the sun determines a188 sell-pressure in the ﬁrst quarter, which turns into buy-pressure in the last189 quarter. The buy/sell pressure becomes obvious in the evolution of volume190 of trades (see Figure 3, lower graph): we observe that the volume of trades191 is highest during the ﬁrst and last quarters of each peak hour, reﬂecting192 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 demand/supply side pressures.193 We also found a persistent zigzag pattern of prices during oﬀ-peak hours194 (between 2000–0800), as shown in Figure 4. This is driven by the production195 design of fossil power plants (supply side: when it starts low and ends high)196 or power-intensive industry (demand side: when it starts high and ends low).197 A reason for that may be inter-temporal restrictions in using fossil plants.198 In addition to fuel costs, these plants have ramp-up and ramp-down costs,199 which prevent plant operators from shutting down plants in case of drops in200 demand or starting up plants in case of spikes in demand. The short-term201 marginal costs from this may dominate fuel costs.202 The typical zigzag seasonality pattern of intraday quarter-hourly prices203 will be corrected by dummy variables in our model speciﬁcation.204 3. Input variables: deﬁnition and data sources205 As motivated in section 2, for the analysis we employed historical day-206 ahead and intraday electricity prices for 15-minute products in the continuous207 trading system between 01/01/2014–30/06/2014. As fundamental variables208 selected in this study we refer to demand forecast, power plant availability,209 intraday updated forecasts for wind and photovoltaic, volume of trades in210 the continuous trading, and the control area balance. The latter represents211 the corresponding use of balancing power in the balancing market 1. In par-212 ticular, the control area balance corresponds to the sum of all balance group213 deviations of balance groups registered at the Transmission System Operator214 and of the relevant balance groups owned by the transmission system oper-215 ator (e.g. EEG, grid losses, unintentional deviation) 2. In Tables 1 and 2 we216 give an overview of the data sources and their frequency, respectively.217 1As balance group deviations are not immediately available online the control area balance is calculated on the basis of the corresponding use of balancing power. The published data are values from operating measurements that are adjusted by measurement corrections if necessary. The actual settlement-relevant data can be retrieved under the prices for grid balancing. 2see http://www.tennettso.de 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19Sunshine durationPrices Peak quarter of hours Intraday quarter-hourly prices long-term mean summer peak versus sunshine duration Price_Last_Avg Mean_Price_Avg Sunshine_Avg 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 0 153045 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19Volume of tradesPrice Peak quarter of hours Intraday quarter-hourly prices long-term mean summer peak versus volume of trades Price_Last_Avg Mean_Price_Avg SumVol_AvgFigure 3: Seasonality pattern of the last prices and average prices bid for a certain quarter of an hour during the peak hours in summer.

Asymmetric model for intraday prices218 4.1. Threshold model speciﬁcation219 The technical speciﬁcation of our model follows [21] and reads:220 yi = θ′ 1xi + εi, ωi ≤ τ, (1) 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 yi = θ′ 2xi + εi, ωi > τ, (2) where ωi is the threshold variable used to split the sample into two regimes.221 The random variable εi is a regression error.222 Our observed sample is {yi, xi, ωi}n i=1, where yi represent the dependent223 variable and xi is an m-vector of independent variables. The threshold vari-224 able ωi may be an element of xi and is assumed to have a continuous dis-225 tribution. To write the model in a single equation 3, we deﬁne the dummy226 variable di(τ ) = 1[ωi ≤ τ ], where 1[·] is the indicator function and we set227 xi(τ ) := xidi(τ ). Furthermore, let λ ′ n = θ′ 2 − θ′ 1 denote the threshold eﬀect.228 Thus, equations (1) and (2) become:229 yi = θ′xi + λ′ nxi(τ ) + εi (3) In order to simplify the threshold estimation procedure, we rewrite equa-230 tion (3) in matrix notation. We deﬁne the vectors Y ∈ Rn and ε ∈ R n 231 by stacking the variables yi and εi, and the n×m matrixes X ∈ Rn×m and232 X(τ ) ∈ R n×m by stacking the vectors x′ i and xi(τ ) ′. Then (3) can be written233 as:234 Y = Xθ + X(τ )λn + ε (4) The regression parameters are (θ, λn, τ ) and the natural estimator is least235 squares (LS).236 4.2. Hansen’s grid search to locate the most likely threshold237 To determine the location of the most likely threshold, we will apply238 Hansen’s grid search. In the implementation of this threshold estimation239 procedure, we follow [11] and [12]. This paper develops a statistical theory for240 threshold estimation in the regression context. As mentioned in the previous241 section, the regression parameters are (θ, λn, τ ). Let242 Sn(θ, λ, τ ) = (Y − Xθ − X(τ )λ)′(Y − Xθ − X(τ )λ) (5) be the sum of squared errors function. Then, by deﬁnition, the LS estima- tors ˆθ, ˆλ, ˆτ jointly minimize (5). For this minimization, τ is assumed to be restricted to a bounded set [τ , ¯τ ] = Ω. The LS estimator is also the MLE 3see Hansen (2000) 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 when εi is i.i.d. N (0, σ2). Following [11], the computationally easiest method to obtain the LS estimates is through concentration. Conditional on τ , equa- tion (4) is linear in θ and in λn, yielding the conditional OLS estimators ˆθ(τ ) and ˆλ(τ ) by regression of Y on X(τ )∗ = [XX(τ )]. The concentrated sum of squared errors function is Sn(τ ) = Sn(ˆθ(τ ), ˆλ(τ ), τ ) = Y ′Y − Y ′X(τ ) ∗(X(τ ) ∗′X(τ )∗) −1X(τ )∗′Y, and ˆτ is the value that minimizes Sn(τ ), i.e., ˆτ = argmin Sn(τ ) To test the hypothesis H0 : τ = τ0, a standard approach is to use the like-243 lihood ratio statistic under the auxiliary assumption that εi is i.i.d. N (0, σ2).244 Let LRn(τ ) := nSn(τ ) − Sn(ˆτ ) Sn(ˆτ ) . The likelihood ratio test of H0 is to reject for large values of LRn(τ0). Using the LRn(τ ) function, asymptotic p-values for the likelihood ratio test are derived: pn = 1 − ( 1 − exp(−1/2 · LRn(τ0)2) )2 . 5. Fundamental modeling of intraday prices245 In our model, we examine whether intraday prices in the continuous bid-246 ding system are caused by market fundamentals. As already mentioned ear-247 lier in this study, marketers of renewable energy use the intraday market to248 balance out diﬀerences between actual/updated forecasts of wind and PV.249 Indeed, discussions with energy traders revealed that at the time of the bid250 market participants have private access to the freshest weather forecasts for251 a certain quarter of an hour (delivery period) and use this information for252 adjusting their bids accordingly. Intuitively, this adjustment causes devia-253 tions between the intraday and day-ahead prices for a certain delivery period.254 An understanding of these deviations is furthermore important for strategic255 bidding.256 The impact of forecasting errors in renewables on intraday prices should257 however not be judged in isolation, but dependent on the demand quote,258 meaning the extent at which forecasted demand for a certain hour is covered259 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 by the traditional capacity planned in the day-ahead market. Keeping in260 mind that renewables are fed with priority into the electricity grid, accord-261 ingly, more or less traditional capacity is planned (and more or less demand262 gap or demand quote is realized). Thus, intuitively, the higher the expecta-263 tion from the renewables in the market day-ahead, the higher the demand264 quote: power producers plan overall less traditional capacity, since the resid-265 ual demand is expected to be covered by wind/PV infeed.266 As discussed in section 2, dependent on the demand quote regime, thus, if267 there is excess demand or not in the market, positive and negative forecasting268 errors in wind and PV are expected to have diﬀerent impact on price devia-269 tions. In the context of a threshold model speciﬁcation, where the threshold270 variable is the demand quote, we will examine these dynamics.271 5.1. Modeling deviations of last prices from the day-ahead price272 In the ﬁrst part of our analysis, we analyze the diﬀerences between the273 historical last prices bid for a certain 15-minute delivery period in the intra-274 day market and the day-ahead price for the corresponding hour. We used275 historical last prices sorted for quarter-hourly products between 01/01/2014–276 30/06/2014. As market fundamentals we include positive/negative forecast-277 ing errors in wind and PV, deﬁned as deviations between the latest forecast278 available at the time when the last prices are observed and the day-ahead279 available forecasts. The last prices for a certain delivery period are placed in280 the market not later than 30 minutes before the delivery period starts 4. At281 this time, market participants also forecast the volume in the balancing mar-282 ket, namely positions that could not be ﬁlled in the intra-day market. These283 positions are deﬁned by the Transmission System Operators as “control area284 balances” 5.285 We derive the forecasts of control area balances based on an autoregressive286 model.6 Results are shown in Table 3. The order of lags has been identiﬁed287 by examining the autocorrelation function and we further performed Akaike288 (AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) information criteria to select the best model7.289 4Since 16th July, 2015, EPEX Spot will shorten the lead time from 45- to 30 minute be- fore delivery (see European Power Exchange (EPEX) https://www.epexspot.com/en/). 5see http://www.tennettso.de 6Discussions with traders revealed that this is a common praxis in the industry. 7Results are available upon request 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 We found that the control area balances for a certain 15-minute delivery290 period can be forecasted based on the last 8 observations (up to 2 hours ago).291 Forecasts based on this model are further included in our model estimation.292 The demand quote is deﬁned as:293 DemandQuotet = DemandF orecastt/P P Adt (6) where d is the day-ahead and t one hour in day d. DemandF orecastt is294 the demand forecast for the relevant hour t on the delivery day d overall295 Transmission System Operators (source ENTSOE8). Based on the expected296 demand, power producers plan traditional capacity day-ahead. The PPA is297 the ex-ante expected power plant availability for electricity production on298 the delivery day (daily granularity), daily published at 10:00 am (see Table 1299 for the exact data sources). These data exclude the renewable capacity and300 include only the traditional plants9. EPEX publishes data on installed and301 available capacities. Although these publications are voluntary, participating302 companies have tripled in 2010 and by the end of the year represented 89%303 of all relevant companies (see [22]). Thus, the numbers provided can be304 considered a reasonable approximation for the entire market. We use ex-ante305 demand quote as explanatory variable to our model to take into account to306 which extent the expected demand for electricity for the day-ahead is covered307 by the planned traditional capacity.308 In Tables A.10 and A.11 we show descriptive statistics of the selected309 input variables. We distinguish between summer/winter, peak/oﬀ peak hours310 (as shown in [23]). We observe that, independent on the season, on average311 the intraday last price for 15-minute delivery periods is below the day-ahead312 price for the corresponding hour. Furthermore, the diﬀerence becomes larger313 and more volatile for peak than for oﬀ-peak hours and in winter than in314 summer. The control area balances are, on average, negative in winter and315 turn into positive in summer. On average, the demand quote is higher and316 more volatile during peak than in oﬀ-peak hours.317 To test for stationarity we perform an augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF318 test). For all variables we reject the null hypothesis of a unit root at a 95%319 signiﬁcance level meaning that the data is stationary.320 8European Energy Exchange & Transmission System Operators 9The PPA includes: coal, gas, lignite, oil, pumped-storage, run-of-the-river, seasonal- store and uranium planned capacity day-ahead. 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Table 3: Autoregressive model for control area balances Dependent Variable: Balances Method: Least Squares Included observations: 2535 after adjustments Variable Coeﬃcient Std.

Based on the information of the long-322 term dynamics of historical last prices, we control for the seasonal pattern323 by introducing dummy variables as follows:324 • Summer peak325 – We introduce one Dummy variable for each of the Q1–Q4 quarters326 for the interval 08:00–13:00 (Morning pattern)327 – We introduce one Dummy variable for each of the Q1–Q4 quarters328 for the interval 14:00–18:00 (Afternoon pattern)329 • Winter peak330 – We introduce one Dummy variable for each of the Q1–Q4 quarters331 for the interval 08:00–12:00 (Morning pattern)332 – We introduce one Dummy variable for each of the Q1–Q4 quarters333 for the interval 13:00–17:00 (Afternoon pattern)334 • Summer oﬀ-peak335 – We introduce one Dummy variable for each of the Q1–Q4 quarters336 for the interval 20:00–01:00 (Evening descending pattern)337 – We introduce one Dummy variable for each of the Q1–Q4 quarters338 for the interval 03:00–07:00 (Early morning ascending pattern)339 • Winter oﬀ-peak340 – We introduce one Dummy variable for each of the Q1–Q4 quarters341 for the interval 20:00–21:00 and 04:00–07:00 (Descending pattern)342 – We introduce one Dummy variable for each of the Q1–Q4 quarters343 for the interval 23:00–03:00 (Night, ascending pattern)344 The model speciﬁcation reads:345 17 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 (P ID t − P Dahd t ) h = ch + βhControlAreaBalancet1h t + θhDemandQuotet1h t + khn(W indID t − W indDahd t )1 h t 1n t + khp(W indID t − − W indDahd t )1h t 1p t + khn(P V ID t − P V Dahd t )1h t 1 n t + khp(P V ID t − P V Dahd t )1 h t 1p t + 8∑ j=1 δh j DQj (P ID t − P Dahd t )l = cl + βlControlAreaBalancet1l t + θlDemandQuotet1 l t + kln(W indID t − W indDahd t )1l t1 n t + klp(W indID t − − W indDahd t )1l t1p t + kln(P V ID t − P V Dahd t )1l t1n t + klp(P V ID t − P V Dahd t )1l t1p t + 8∑ j=1 δl jDQj (7) As threshold variable, the demand quote splits the data in two regimes:346 high/suﬃcient demand quote (“h”) or low (“l”). The indicator function 1p/n t347 further distinguishes in each regime between positive/negative forecasting348 errors in renewables.349 5.2. Model for the continuous trades for quarter-hourly products350 In the second part, we examine the continuous trades for several quarter-351 hourly products. In particular, we are interested to see how delta bid prices352 for a certain quarter of an hour change when new information on the fore-353 casts for wind and PV becomes available. We look at the trade-oﬀ between354 autoregressive terms and fundamental factors impacting the intraday price355 formation process.356 The model speciﬁcation reads:357 (∆P ID t ) h = ch + αh 1 ∆P ID t−11h t + αh 2 ∆P ID t−21h t + αh 3 ∆P ID t−31 h t + khn w (∆W indID t )1h t 1n t + khp w (∆W indID t )1h t 1p t + khn P V (∆P V ID t )1 h t 1n t + khp P V (∆P V ID t )1h t 1p t + γhDemandQuoteDahd t 1h t + ϵ hV olume ID t 1h t + βh√ ∆t 18 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 (∆P ID t ) l = cl + αl 1∆P ID t−11 l t + αl 2∆P ID t−21 l t + αl 3∆P ID t−31l t + kln w (∆W indID t )1l t1n t + klp w (∆W indID t )1l t1 p t + kln P V (∆P V ID t )1 l t1 n t + klp P V (∆P V ID t )1l t1p t + γlDemandQuoteDahd t 1 l t + ϵ lV olume ID t 1l t + βl√ ∆t (8) The examination of autocorrelation function of price changes for a cer-358 tain quarter of an hour shows that the ﬁrst 3 lags of price changes should359 be selected in the autoregressive part of the model. Changes in the wind,360 ∆W indID t , and in the PV, ∆P V ID t , are real time updated forecasts, avail-361 able at the time when bids are placed. 10 V olume ID t is the volume trade at362 the time when the price change is observed. The bids for a certain quarter363 of an hour do not occur at equal time intervals in the continuous bidding.364 In fact, market participants start bidding around 4 pm, after the day-ahead365 prices are published at EPEX and continuous trades go up to 30 minutes366 before the beginning of the delivery period. Thus, the time steps between367 consecutively placed bids are not equal, but can vary from some seconds to368 several hours. We take into account this time discontinuity by including in369 our list of explanatory variables the control variable √∆t.370 In Tables A.12 and A.13 we show descriptive statistics for the price371 changes and volume of trades for the 15-minute continuous trading for de-372 livery periods at diﬀerent times of the day. We observe that the volatility of373 intraday price changes increases continuously between the morning quarter of374 hours (H7Q1) up to noon (H12Q4) and decreases again towards the evening375 (quarters of hour 18). Thus, the higher the demand, the larger the average376 price changes in the continuous trading. The volume of trades is on average377 the highest and most volatile for the ﬁrst and last quarters of each one of the378 investigated hours, independent on the time of the day. This explains the379 sell/buy pressure, as explained in Section 2.380 10Results are available upon request 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 6. Estimation results and interpretation381 6.1. Modeling deviations of last prices from the day-ahead price382 The model shown in Equation (7) has been estimated for the historical383 diﬀerences between the last prices and the day-ahead prices separately for384 winter and summer and we further distinguished between peak (8 am and385 8 pm) and oﬀ-peak hours. This approach is justiﬁed by the diﬀerent price386 levels in summer compared to the winter time and by the diﬀerent demand387 proﬁles during peak and oﬀ-peak hours (see [23] for an extensive discussion388 on the seasonality of electricity prices).389 As a preliminary analysis, we estimated the model without allowing for390 a threshold eﬀect, to assess whether there is a linear adjustment of intraday391 (last) prices to market fundamentals. The overall OLS estimation results for392 each case study are shown in Table 4.393 Throughout all variables are signiﬁcant and show the expected sign (see394 Table 4). Dummy variables which explain the zigzag pattern are statisti-395 cally signiﬁcant and their inclusion still allows signiﬁcant marginal eﬀects of396 fundamental variables on delta prices. The coeﬃcients of positive/negative397 forecasting errors in wind and PV are signiﬁcant at 1% signiﬁcance level.398 Positive forecasting errors of wind/PV signal market participants more ca-399 pacity available in the market than planned. This will have a decreasing eﬀect400 on the residual demand and will further decrease last price bids. Viceversa,401 when updated forecasts signal less infeed from renewables than planned in402 the day ahead (negative forecasting errors), market participants will increase403 their bid prices intraday accordingly.404 At the time of the last price bids, market participants do not know yet the405 real control area balances, but forecasts of those are used in practice. This406 is reﬂected in the coeﬃcients of balances forecasts which are statistically407 signiﬁcant in all case studies and have a positive sign. Higher control area408 balances are a signal of excess demand which has not been yet balanced out in409 the intraday market, and this will be reﬂected in higher intraday last prices.410 We observe that the coeﬃcient of demand quote is negative during the411 oﬀ-peak regimes, but it turns into positive during peak hours. The mean412 value of demand quote in the oﬀ-peak hours is slightly below one, touching413 a maximum of 1.291 and 1.178, respectively (as shown in Tables A.10 and414 A.11). Thus, on average, the traditional capacity planned in the market415 covers the expected demand for the day-ahead. In Figure 5, the upper graph416 illustrates such a theoretical case, where the demand quote is 1. However, at417 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 higher levels of demand quote (up to a maximum observed in oﬀ-peak hours418 of about 1.2), power producers plan less capacity for the day ahead, due to419 a higher expectation of renewables infeed in the market (see Figure 5, lower420 graph). 11. That means, less expensive capacity is planned, which situates the421 prices in the less convex area of the merit order. The input from renewable422 energies is expected to be, on average, 20% of the total input production mix423 in Germany (see [22]). Renewables will be fed with priority into the grid,424 decreasing the residual demand and thus market participants will bid lower425 prices intraday. This assumption is conﬁrmed by the negative sign of the426 coeﬃcients of demand quote in the oﬀ-peak hours winter/summer, as shown427 in Table 4.428 For the peak hours descriptive statistics show that on average, the demand429 quote exceeds 1.2 (see Table A.11), which means that there is more than430 20% of the expected demand uncovered by the planned traditional capacity.431 Thus, power producers plan less capacity in the market, given a high market432 expectation for renewables infeed in peak hours. We illustrate graphically433 this situation in Figure 6, lower graph. However, demand quotes above 1.2434 reﬂect the situation where the 20% expected infeed from renewables will not435 suﬃce and there will be still high residual demand in the market. This will436 have an increasing eﬀect on intraday prices in general and on the last prices437 in particular, which is conﬁrmed by the positive sign of the coeﬃcient of438 demand quote (see Table 4) 12.439 We further tested for a threshold eﬀect in the demand quote in each case.440 The threshold variable is the demand quote and the threshold location is esti-441 mated using the methodology described in section 4.2. All model parameters442 in Equations (7) are allowed to vary among regimes. We found evidence for443 signiﬁcant threshold eﬀect only in the case of winter peak case study. Results444 are available in Table 5.445 We found no signiﬁcant threshold eﬀect in the demand quote in summer-446 related case studies and in winter oﬀ-peak. This shows that in those seasons,447 market participants adjust linearly last prices (and implicitly the spreads448 last prices-day-ahead prices) to market fundamentals. However, in winter449 peak time we found evidence for asymmetric behavior (see Table 5). Thus,450 11It is known that in the night hours extreme wind infeed occur (see [23]). 12This is reﬂected in the high maximum spreads between the last prices and day-ahead prices observed in summer peak, as shown in Table A.11. 21 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 market price variable costs available capacity nuclear lignite coal hard coal natural gas Demand Quote =1 oil The traditional planned capacity for the day-ahead covers fully the expected demand for electricity.

That is, power453 producers have low expectation of renewable infeed in the day-ahead, and in454 consequence plan suﬃcient traditional capacity to satisfy expected demand.455 However, when demand levels are high, thus in regime 2, delta prices adjust456 linearly to forecasting errors in renewable energy, to control area balances457 and to demand quote. An increase in demand quote in this regime will458 furthermore suppress bid prices in the intraday market, since again higher459 demand quote levels reﬂect a high expectation of infeed from renewable ener-460 gies, which will lower the price level. The coeﬃcient of control area balances461 is positive and signiﬁcant. This reﬂects two situations: if there is high infeed462 from renewables in the market, negative forecasts of control area balances463 will suppress the intraday last prices. By contrary, in the presence of high464 demand quote not fully covered by renewables infeed, positive forecasts in465 control area balances will increase intraday price bids.466 The model can be used to forecast the last prices submitted for a certain467 quarter of one hour intraday. This is based on a rigourous forecasting model468 for the control area balances. This model is highly relevant for practitioners:469 the main goal of market participants is to clear their positions in the day-470 ahead and intraday markets and avoid participating in the more expensive471 balancing market.472 6.2. Model for the continuous trades for quarter-hourly products473 In this section, we show the impact of fundamental variables on the (con-474 tinuous) bidding behavior. We checked for both linear and asymmetric ad-475 justment of intraday price changes to explanatory variables, dependent on476 the time of the day. We therefore replicated the analysis to diﬀerent delivery477 periods (peak/oﬀ-peak) corresponding to diﬀerent demand proﬁles: quarters478 1–4 of hours 7, 12 and 18 have been investigated. The estimation results479 of (OLS) linear estimation, without threshold, of Equation (8) are shown480 in Table 6, B.14 and B.15. The main threshold estimation results following481 the speciﬁcation in Equation (8) are shown in Tables 7–9. In all cases the482 demand quote has been found to be the only signiﬁcant threshold variable. 13 483 13The threshold values are signiﬁcant, accordingly to the likelihood ratio test, as dis- cussed in section 4.1.

By comparing the values of the R2 485 between the lower and upper panels we observe that at noon fundamental486 variables increase the explanatory power of the model by up to 4 times.487 This eﬀect is however less obvious in the case of morning and evening peak488 quarter-hourly products (see Tables B.14 and B.15).489 More speciﬁcally, results reveal that during morning and evening the in-490 formation from lagged price changes become more relevant for the price for-491 mation process than fundamental variables. However, fundamentals become492 signiﬁcant during noon (see Table 6). This can be due to the fact that493 over noon, given the high demand for electricity in the market, the merit494 order (MO) curve is usually very steep, since more expensive plants are on495 use. Thus, market participants become more sensitive to market fundamen-496 tals, in particular to forecasting errors of renewable energies, given their low497 marginal costs of production. Negative forecasting errors in wind and PV498 would further increase the steepness of the MO, which leads to increased499 intraday prices, while positive forecasting errors in renewables will have a500 suppressing eﬀect on prices.501 In Table 8 we allow for threshold eﬀect in the demand quote for quarters502 1–4 of hour 12. Similarly to the results in section 6.1, a threshold has been503 found signiﬁcant when the demand quote is around 1.2, which allows a nice504 interpretation, given the 20% expected infeed from renewables in the German505 power market. Given this expectation, less traditional plants are planned506 day-ahead (see Figures 5 and 6). Also in this case, we conclude an asymmetric507 adjustment of intraday price changes to forecasting errors of wind and PV,508 dependent on the demand quote regime. In particular, results reveal that509 market participants adjust their intraday bids to updated forecasts moreover510 in the high demand quote regime. Thus, when there is a high expected infeed511 from renewables day-ahead, market participants follow updated forecasted512 errors in wind and PV and incorporate this information in adjusting their513 bids accordingly intraday. This eﬀect becomes more obvious for noon hours,514 when the demand is high and the MO is usually steeper than during morning515 and evening hours. Thus, Tables 7 and 9 show that the role of forecasting516 errors of renewables for the morning and evening quarters drops, independent517 are available upon request. We have tested for threshold signiﬁcance also in the other fundamental variables, but no conclusive results were obtained. 27 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 of the demand quote regime.518 Still, during morning and evening delivery periods (Tables 7 and 9) we519 observe that market fundamentals help explaining the zigzag pattern of in-520 traday prices: positive forecasting errors in PV decrease prices in quarter 4521 of hour 7 in regime 2, which reﬂects the ramping up eﬀect of the sun. By con-522 trary, forecasting errors of wind and PV impact intraday prices in the ﬁrst523 3 quarters of hour 18. After this quarter, however, the role of forecasting524 errors of PV drops, showing the ramping down eﬀect of the sun.525 Results reveal further evidence for the ramping up/down eﬀects of the526 sun, reﬂected in the sign of the volume of trades. We observe that the527 corresponding coeﬃcient is signiﬁcant only for quarter 4 of hour 7 (see Table528 B.14) and has a negative sign. This pattern is again observed in the threshold529 model for hour 7 (see Table 7) in regime 1, when the demand quote is below530 1.415 (see Tables 7). For the last quarter of hour 7 the intraday price is below531 the average price bid for hour 7 in the day-ahead due to the sun ramping532 up eﬀect, reﬂecting an oversupply of the accounting grid (see Figure 2).533 However, for hour 18 this eﬀect is reverted. As shown in Tables B.15 and 9,534 the coeﬃcient of volume of trades is signiﬁcant and has a negative sign for535 the ﬁrst quarter of hour 18 and turns into positive in the last quarter. This536 reﬂects the sun ramping down eﬀect, which causes the zigzag pattern for the537 evening hours: the intraday price for quarter 1 is below the average price bid538 in the day-ahead for the respective hour (oversupply of the accounting grid)539 and it ends above it for quarter 4, reﬂecting shortfalls in the accounting grid.540 28 Electronic copy available at:

Conclusion541 In this study, we investigate the bidding behavior in the intraday elec-542 tricity market, in the context of a fundamental model. In particular, we543 shed light on the impact of updated forecasting errors of wind and photo-544 voltaic (PV) on the 15-minute electricity price changes in the continuous545 bidding. We employ a unique data set of the latest forecasts of wind and PV546 available to traders prior to the placements of their price bids intraday. To547 our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study in the literature which models intra-548 day prices based on prior information on fundamentals. We further control549 for the demand/supply disequilibria, volume of trades, forecasts of control550 area balances and model the typical zigzag seasonality pattern of 15-minute551 prices.552 Our analysis is twofold. We ﬁrstly propose a forecasting model for the553 changes between last prices bid intraday for a certain quarter of an hour and554 the corresponding day-ahead price. This is highly relevant, since market par-555 ticipants are mainly interested in squeezing their positions in the day-ahead556 or intraday markets and avoid ending into the control area balancing mar-557 ket. Secondly, a fundamental model for the price changes in the continuous558 bidding is derived. We found clear evidence that the bidding behavior is559 inﬂuenced by forecasting errors in renewables, available at the time of the560 bid. Intuitively, intraday prices increase in negative forecasting errors, while561 positive forecasting errors have a suppressing eﬀect on prices.562 We account for both linear and asymmetric adjustments of price changes563 to market fundamentals. The asymmetries are driven by the threshold vari-564 able demand quote. This shows market participants the proportion in which565 the expected demand is covered by the planned traditional capacity in the566 day-ahead market. Our model disentangles the eﬀect of market fundamen-567 tals dependent on the regime of the demand quote and further dependent568 on the time of the day. Tangentially, market fundamentals inﬂuence more569 the bidding behavior in the middle of the day than during mornings and570 evenings. There is an asymmetric adjustment of electricity prices with re-571 spect to both volume of trades and forecasting errors in renewables. Namely,572 in the high regime of the demand quote, where there is too little planned573 traditional capacity in the day-ahead market, traders incorporate the infor-574 mation of the latest available forecasting errors of renewables in their bids575 with a higher speed. This eﬀect is more obvious for the mid-day quarters,576 but less obvious during morning and evening hours. Thus, the historically577 33 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2671379 derived threshold in the demand quote for a speciﬁc delivery period is a578 highly relevant information for strategically bidding in the intraday market.579 The actual demand quote can be compared to the historical threshold value580 and, dependent whether the market is in the low/high demand quote regime,581 market participants can use the model for one-period forecasts accordingly.582 The identiﬁcation of regimes in the demand quote helps also to disentangle583 the demand/supply side volume of trades. In the regime of high demand584 quote, demand-side volume of trades have an increasing eﬀect on prices.585 Vice versa, supply-side volumes have a suppressing eﬀect on intraday prices,586 which becomes obvious in the low regime of the demand quote.587 Outlook588 Our model aims at understanding the bidding behavior historically speak-589 ing and oﬀers a solid basis for one-period forecast of last intraday prices and590 continuous bids. Since all variables used as input can be computed based591 on the information available at the time of the bid (demand quote, updated592 forecasts in renewables), the model can be used for forecasting the (next)593 continuous bid. We prove the superiority of such a fundamental model over594 the classical AR model representation. Still, we do not oﬀer evidentiary sup-595 port that this is the best model for intraday prices, but given that it is the596 ﬁrst study which employs intraday-updated renewables forecasts, it is cer-597 tainly the most realistic representation existing in the literature up to present.598 Practitioners use in reality updated forecasted errors as private information599 to bid more accurately in the intraday electricity market.
