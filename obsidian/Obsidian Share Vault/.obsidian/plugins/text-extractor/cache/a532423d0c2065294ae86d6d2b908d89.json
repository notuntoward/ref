INTRODUCTION With the expected growth of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) over the coming years, the load behavior of EV charging system becomes an important area of research. There is an evidence of a dramatic increase in the number of Electric Vehicle (EVs) for domestic use in Australia [1]. In order to make EV as a feasible alternative to conventional petrol-driven vehicle, it is crucial to develop smart battery chargers. In particular, battery chargers can produce effects on low voltage distribution systems. Although these effects are small in a distribution system from a view of a single EV owner, however there are a large number of EVs that may be charged at the same time from a distribution grid and hence deleterious effects in an entire distribution system can be highly significant. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective EV load model to investigate the impacts that charging of PEVs can have on the security and operation of distribution grids [2]. Load model is a set of equations represented the mathematical relationship between a bus voltage magnitude and frequency at a given bus-bar and the (active and reactive) power or the current flowing into the load of the same bus. Two typical load models, which are well developed and applied, are static load model and dynamic load model. While the relationship in static load model is described by algebraic equations, differential equations are used instead to represent the dynamic behavior of the system in dynamic load model [3, 4]. Typically, loads are modeled as purely static functions of voltage and frequency in which the per unit voltage variation is much larger than the per unit frequency variation. It should be noted that, in fact, load can be broadly categorized into two categories: one category in which electrical power is independent of frequency, such as lighting, heating or any pure resistive loads, and the other category in which electrical power is dependent on frequency, such as motor, fans or any inductive loads. Thus, in a composite load bus, the change in electrical power is not equal to the initial change in load power, but a part of load that varies with the changing of frequency [5]. There are two types of battery chargers which are off-board charger and on-board charger. Off-board charger can be separated from the EV and can be compared to a petrol station aimed to have a fast charge. On-board charger is combined with the EV and can be separated from the driving system or combined with the inverter connected to drive motor [6] and would be appropriate for slow charge using a household power outlet during night times, when demand for electricity is low. In many designs and studies related to EV battery chargers, the EV battery loads are considered as a static load and the realistic system behavior of the batteries during charging process have been ignored. Indeed, the energy consumption by an EV is a function of not only the terminal voltage but also other variables governed by the battery state of charge (SOC) due to the changes in charging rate. Furthermore, the voltage dependency of the charging system is a function of SOC and this can cause different load characteristics for different SOC levels [7]. As a result, there is a necessity to characterize the dynamics of the EV loads due to battery charging considering different SOC levels.
