Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in electric vehicles because of their high energy density and long cycle life. However, the spontaneous combustion accident of electric vehicles caused by thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries seriously threatens passengers' personal and property safety. This paper expounds on the internal mechanism of lithium-ion battery thermal runaway through many previous studies and summarizes the proposed lithium-ion battery thermal runaway prediction and early warning methods. These methods can be classified into battery electrochemistry-based, battery big data analysis, and artificial intelligence methods. In this paper, various lithium-ion thermal runaway prediction and early warning methods are analyzed in detail, including the advantages and disadvantages of each method, and the challenges and future development directions of the intelligent lithium-ion battery thermal runaway prediction and early warning methods are discussed. Introduction In our daily life, vehicles have become essential tools of trans- portation. Traditional vehicles are powered by gasoline or die- sel. Nowadays, the popularity of gasoline and diesel vehicles is declining because of severe exhaust pollution [1] and the reduc- tion of available fossil energy [2]. With the advancement of technology, electric vehicles have attracted more and more attention, especially pure electric vehicles that do not pollute the environment. As the core energy source of electric vehicles, many types of batteries exist. Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in electric vehicles because of their high energy density and long service life compared with lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride batteries [3,4]. However, with the continuous improve- ment of lithium-ion batteries' energy density, the batteries' safety decreases, mainly manifested in the increasing risk of thermal runaway [5–7]. In recent years, the spontaneous com- bustion accidents of electric vehicles caused by thermal runa- way of lithium-ion batteries have occurred frequently, which has seriously hindered the development of electric vehicles. Although the causes of the thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries are complicated, many scholars have studied the ther- mal runaway mechanism of lithium-ion batteries for many years. The causes and internal processes of thermal runaway have been explored [8,9]. To improve the safety of power bat- teries and promote the globalization of electric vehicles, it is essential to establish an accurate and widely applicable power battery thermal runaway prediction and early warning method. For this reason, many scholars at home and abroad have con- ducted comprehensive and in-depth research. The thermal runaway prediction and early warning of lithium- ion batteries are mainly achieved by inputting the real-time data collected by the sensor into the established algorithm and comparing it with the thermal runaway boundary, as shown in Fig. 1. The data collected by the sensor include conventional voltage, current, temperature, gas concentration [10], and expan- sion force [11]. In general, the thermal runaway prediction meth- ods of lithium-ion batteries can be divided into 2 categories. The first category is established on the basis of the internal electro- chemical mechanism of the battery, which is mainly based on heat generation calculation, gas generation monitoring, expan- sion force monitoring, and electrochemical impedance spectros- copy (EIS) testing [12–14]. The methods are highly interpretable, but it is a challenge to establish an accurate prediction model due to the randomness and complicated mechanism of thermal run- away events. The second category is the methods established by artificial intelligence algorithms based on battery big data. On the one hand, the model uses information including but not limited to correlation coefficients between voltages, thresholds, sample entropy, etc. to analyze the abnormal performance of voltages in massive real-vehicle data. On the other hand, some models use machine learning methods to directly predict whether the battery is abnormal or even thermal runaway occurs, which is mostly based on experimental data and real data. Such methods combined with modern informatics have great potential [15]. In addition, we can establish a neural network model as the real battery voltage representation using artificial intelligence and carry out feature extraction and data expansion with the help of an electrochemical model to realize the estimation of battery aging and fault [16,17]. However, most of the novel methods can only be verified for specific experimental datasets or data that are difficult to collect by simple sensors, while for thermal runaway of real vehicles, most of them perform post-mortem analysis on the data collected by a battery man- agement system (BMS).

This review summarizes the latest research results on thermal runaway mechanisms and predic- tion algorithms of power batteries. Firstly, the internal mech- anism and various incentives of power battery thermal runaway are summarized, including mechanical abuse, electrical abuse, and thermal abuse. Then, the thermal runaway prediction methods established on the basis of the electrochemical mech- anism of the battery are summarized, including the calculation of heat generation, the monitoring of gas generation, and the EIS test. The article summarizes these methods and compares their characteristics. Then, the thermal runaway prediction methods established on the basis of actual battery vehicle big data are introduced, including thermal runaway case analysis based on real-vehicle big data, methods based on statistics and information, fault injection based on real batteries and coupled models, and the thermal runaway methods based on machine learning. Finally, the difficulties and challenges in establishing a thermal runaway prediction method for power batteries are discussed, and pertinent suggestions are put forward. Thermal Runaway Mechanism of Lithium-Ion Batteries Lithium-ion battery thermal runaway is a phenomenon in which the temperature of the battery suddenly and uncontrollably rises sharply, eventually leading to the explosion and burning of the battery. In the process of battery temperature rise, there are 3 characteristic temperatures, T1, T2, and T3, related to thermal runaway [18]. T1 is the temperature at the beginning of the self-generated heat of the side reaction; T2 is the critical value when the temperature of the battery slowly rises to a sharp rise, which represents the trigger temperature of the thermal runaway of the battery; and T3 is the peak temperature that can be reached during the thermal runaway, which represents the amount of energy released. The reasons for the thermal runaway of lithi- um-ion batteries can be mainly divided into 3 categories, namely mechanical abuse (acupuncture, collision, etc.), electrical abuse (overcharge, overdischarge, etc.), and thermal abuse (external heating, flame attack, etc.) [19]. Regardless of the cause of ther- mal runaway, the internal process of thermal runaway is mainly caused by a series of exothermic chain reactions, that is, the heat released by the side reactions in the previous stage will cause the battery temperature to rise because of the inability to completely dissipate the heat in time. Consequently, the rise in temperature can trigger the next stage of side reactions, eventually leading to thermal runaway. Many researchers have explored the side reactions during the thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries through experiments, including solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) decomposition, anode–electrolyte reaction, separator melting, cathode–electrolyte reaction, electrolyte decomposi- tion, etc. [20–22], as shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2 only analyzes and integrates the initial temperature of each side reaction, but more importantly, it is necessary to quantitatively analyze the heat generation rate and heat gener- ation of each side reaction. Feng et al. [8] drew a diagram of the energy released during the thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries by summarizing nearly 50 literatures on battery chem- ical kinetics, as shown in Fig. 3. The reaction parameters are obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In Fig. 3, ΔH is the total heat released by each reaction, repre- sented by the position on the ordinate axis, Q is the heat release rate of each reaction, represented by the height of the hill, and the shape of each reaction is mainly determined by the Tonset, Tpeak, and Tend. The cathode materials mainly include lithium cobaltite (LCO), lithium titanate (LTO), lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide (NCA), lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and lithium nickel- cobalt-manganese oxide in which the ratio of three transition metal elements is 1:1:1 (NCM111). The separator consists of poly- propylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). The lower-left corner is an example of LFP reaction. The heat released by internal short circuit (ISC) and combustion is shown on the left side of the ordinate. By determining the reaction parameters of each side reac- tion in the process of battery thermal runaway and combining them with the thermal runaway mechanism, a thermal runaway prediction model for lithium-ion batteries can be established, which will not only provide theoretical guidance for the design and production of lithium-ion batteries but also help in the building of prediction and early warning methods for thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries, so that the safety of lithium- ion batteries would be improved ultimately. Thermal Runaway Prediction and Early Warning Method Based on Electrochemical Mechanism The operation of lithium-ion batteries is essentially composed of many complex electrochemical reactions, so it is possible to explore the temperature rise changes and gas release before the thermal runaway of battery by going deep into the electrochem- ical mechanism to establish the thermal runaway prediction and early warning for lithium-ion batteries. This kind of ther- mal runaway prediction and early warning method based on the internal electrochemical mechanism of the battery has the characteristics of strong interpretability. Thermal runaway prediction model based on battery heat generation During the normal operation of the battery, the rise of temper- ature caused by the heat generation of the battery is generally Fig. 1. General process of thermal runaway prediction and early warning method of lithium-ion battery.Downloaded from https://spj.science.org on August 09, 2023 Zhang et al. 2023 | https://doi.org/10.34133/energymatadv.0008 3 steady. However, under abnormal conditions, the heat gener- ated by the side reaction inside the battery is relatively high, which will cause the battery temperature to rise substantially, resulting in thermal runaway. Therefore, it is very important to establish a thermal runaway model to predict the battery temperature change during the thermal runaway process. If the heat generated inside the battery can be dissipated in time through internal heat conduction and external convection, then the thermal runaway will not occur. Shah et al. [23,24] obtained the critical condition for thermal runaway based on the numerical comparison of convective heat transfer coeffi- cient and thermal conductivity through the simple calculation of the internal heat transfer and external heat transfer of the battery and proposed the dimensionless parameters named Thermal Runaway Number (TRN) for thermal runaway pre- diction. The cell will not experience thermal runaway when TRN < 1, but thermal runaway happens when TRN > 1. In addition, the critical temperature Tcritical is proposed [12], which represents the max temperature that can be reached to ensure safety. This study contributes to the prediction of thermal run- away, but the variation of characteristic thermal parameters with temperature is not considered in the model. Battery abuse can generally be divided into thermal, electri- cal, and mechanical abuse. For thermal abuse, Kim et al. [25] established a 3-dimensional thermal abuse model of lithium-ion cells to predict the change of the temperature rise of the battery under the condition of thermal abuse. The model was estab- lished by calculating the internal heat transfer and side reaction heat generation, including the decomposition of SEI film, the reaction between the anode and the electrolyte, and the reaction between the cathode and the decomposition of the electrolyte. Ping et al. [26] improved the model by increasing the heat released by the ISC caused by the melting of the separator and considering the electrical characteristics of the battery so that the voltage and temperature changes of the battery from regular cycling to thermal runaway can be predicted. Feng et al. [27] and Wang et al. [28] established the thermal runaway prediction model for ordinary lithium-ion batteries and large-format high- nickel/silicon-graphite lithium-ion batteries during thermal abuse by coupling the electrochemical and thermal properties of cells. On the basis of the model, the temperature and voltage changes of lithium-ion cells during the thermal runaway caused by thermal abuse can be predicted. In practice, most cells are aged cells that are used for a period of time instead of fresh cells, so the capacity and internal resist- ance have changed significantly. Many researchers have studied the aging mechanism of cells, and it is generally believed that the thickening of the SEI film is an important feature of the aging process [29]. Abada et al. [30] optimized a 3-dimensional thermal abuse model for Li-ion batteries by considering the SEI thickening process. The effect of aging on cell performance was considered, so the temperature rise of both fresh and aged cells under thermal abuse can be predicted. In addition, the thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries may be caused by local heating or ISC instead of uniform heating. Under such thermal abuse conditions, the above model will not be appli- cable. To solve this problem, Zhang et al. [31,32] established a prediction model of lithium-ion cells for thermal runaway caused by ISCs by coupling electrochemistry and heat, as shown in Fig. 4. The thermal runaway zone is separated, and the model establishment process is shown in Fig. 4. Thus, the thermal runaway boundary of the cell can be determined on the basis of different heat source intensities and durations. Besides, the safe zone and the thermal runaway zone are sep- arated. Zhang et al. [33] simulated the thermal runaway process caused by local heating of LFP batteries and pointed out the heat generated by the reaction between electrolyte and anode accounted for 63.8% of the total heat, but the heat generated by ISC is very small, which is consistent with the findings of Ren et al. [34]. For electric abuse, An et al. [35] established the electrochemical–thermal coupling model of lithium-ion battery under external short circuit (ESC) and ultra-high-rate (10 C) discharge, and the thermal runaway process of lithium-ion batteries under ESC and ultra-high-rate discharge can be pre- dicted in the form of an analytical solution. Ren et al. [34] established a prediction model for thermal runaway caused by overcharging and pointed out that the oxidation reaction of the electrolyte and the reaction between the lithium deposited on the anode surface and the electrolyte contributed the most dur- ing the process of thermal runaway caused by overcharging. In addition, the kinetic parameters of the 6 main side reactions were determined by DSC tests, which improved the accuracy of the thermal runaway prediction model [36]. The lithium-ion battery thermal runaway prediction models established by domestic and foreign scholars are reviewed above, which help understand the thermal runaway process Fig. 2. Chain side reactions during thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries.Downloaded from https://spj.science.org on August 09, 2023 Zhang et al. 2023 | https://doi.org/10.34133/energymatadv.0008 4 and guide battery design. However, the above models are only suitable for the prediction of thermal runaway caused by abuse and cannot be directly used for the early warning of spontane- ous thermal runaway caused by unknown reasons during the normal operation of the battery. Thermal runaway early warning method based on gas generation In the early stage of lithium-ion cell thermal runaway, a large amount of gas will be released, reflecting the collapse of the internal structure of the cell and the occurrence of side reac- tions. Thus, many researchers have established warning meth- ods of lithium-ion cells for thermal runaway based on the feature that battery gas generation is earlier than thermal run- away. Cai et al. [37] pointed out that the force signal would suddenly increase because of the expansion of the cell before the gas was released in the early stage of thermal runaway, and then the force signal would decrease as the cell released gas. According to the feature, Cai et al. [14] established an electric- thermal-gas coupling model, which described the relationship between gas generation and expansion force signal, and pro- posed that the thermal runaway can be detected by monitoring the cell expansion force signal. In previous studies, many researchers have carried out a num- ber of studies on the gas generation mechanism of lithium-ion cells, gas composition, and concentration. Doyle's research [38] shows that lithium-ion cells will generate more flammable gases in an overcharged state, resulting in an increased risk of explo- sion. Golubkov et al.[39] studied the gas composition, gas release amount, and total gas release rate of different types of cells when thermal runaway occurs in different state of charge (SOC) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and pointed out that CO2 is the main gas component during the first thermal runaway process of lithium-ion cells, which is consistent with the findings of Lammer et al. [40]. The research indicated that CO2 mainly comes from the decomposition of SEI [41]. According to the finding, Cai et al. [10] proposed a method based on the detection of CO2 concentration changes to warn the thermal runaway of the cell pack. The experiments show that the occurrence of ther- mal runaway event is detected by a CO2 gas sensor at 85 s, which is smaller than propagation critical time (tcrit = 710 s). The tcrit is the interval between the thermal runaway of the first cell and the second cell [42]. The results proved the effectiveness of this method in early warning of thermal runaway of cell packs. At the same time, a thermal runaway warning model based on CO2 concentration detection was established. Yang et al. [43] measured the amount of CO and CO2 released during the thermal runaway of lithium-ion cells under different SOC, different ambient temperatures, and different electric heating power through experiments. In addition, the variation of CO concentration with time was analyzed through Bayesian prior probability distribution theory [44]. The results Fig. 3. Energy-release diagram of thermal runaway process of lithium-ion battery [8].Downloaded from https://spj.science.org on August 09, 2023 Zhang et al. 2023 | https://doi.org/10.34133/energymatadv.0008 5 show that the synthesis uncertainty of CO at the early stage of thermal runaway is significantly larger than that when the ven- tilation valve is opened. Moreover, the safety uncertainty caused by CO was obtained, and thermal runway could be predicted according to the rise of this value. Wang et al. [13] measured the gas release of LFP cells during the thermal runaway caused by overcharging. The results showed that at the early stage after the cell was overcharged, the concentrations of H2, CO, and CO2 changed most obviously, and the concentrations of HCl and HF changed slightly less than the former. Thus, the con- centration monitoring of H2, CO, and CO2 can be applied as the first-level warning for thermal runaway of LFP cells, and the concentration monitoring of HCl and HF can be applied as the second-level warning when the first-level warning cannot accurately detect thermal runaway. Through the above 2-level warning process, the early-warning function of the LFP battery module could be built. The early warning method for thermal runaway of lithium-ion cells based on monitoring gas concentration responses quickly and predicts accurately. Moreover, the method could also be applied to both the thermal runaway prediction caused by abuse and the spontaneous thermal runaway prediction caused by unknown reasons. However, its disadvantage lies in that the interval between the release of gas and the occurrence of thermal runaway is usually short, that is, the advance time of the warning is insufficient. In order to ensure the safety of passengers' lives and property, it is necessary to realize the thermal runaway warn- ing of lithium-ion cells for a long time in advance. Thermal runaway warning method based on EIS As mentioned above, the thermal runaway of lithium-ion cells is mainly caused by the damage of the internal microstructure and a series of side reactions, which is directly manifested as a sharp rise in the internal temperature of the cell. Because of presence of heat conduction, there is a specific time delay in the traditional way of predicting thermal runaway by monitor- ing the surface temperature of the battery with a thermocouple. The thermal runaway prediction method based on EIS was proposed to solve the problem. Electrochemical impedance spectrum can be used to nondestructively study the internal kinetics and electrochemical reactions over a wide frequency range [45]. The schematic diagram of the electrochemical impedance spectrum of the lithium-ion cell is shown in Fig. 5, which is mainly divided into 4 parts, namely the ohmic imped- ance Rb, the impedance of lithium ions passing through the solid electrolyte interface Rsei, the charge transfer impedance Rct and the lithium-ion diffusion impedance W. Several studies have confirmed that there is a certain rela- tionship between the electrochemical impedance spectrum and the internal temperature of the cell. Specifically, the impedance of the lithium-ion cell decreases with the increase of the internal temperature. Basically, it remains stable with the change of SOC [46], which is mainly due to the ionic conduction of the SEI [47,48]. On the basis of this characteristic, Srinivasan et al. [49,50] confirmed that the phase shift φ changes significantly at the early stage of the lithium-ion cell thermal runaway, and the change is independent of cell capacity. Therefore, a warning method for thermal runaway was proposed by monitoring phase shift at a specific frequency. Schmidt et al. [51] established a method based on impedance characteristics to estimate the average internal temperature of the cell, which can be predictive even if the battery's internal temperature is not uniform or when the temperature changes suddenly. In addition, the influence of SOC on the estimation of internal temperature at different fre- quencies was discussed and the results indicated that SOC sig- nificantly affects the results of temperature estimation by impedance at low frequencies and less effective at high frequen- cies. Spinner et al. [52] established the relationship between the imaginary part of impedance and the internal temperature at 300 Hz through the single-point EIS test. The maximum tem- perature of the cell can be estimated is approximately 100 °C, reaching the temperature at which the SEI film decomposes, so the self-generated heat of the cell could be detected and the early warning of thermal runaway could be realized. Raijmakers et al. [53] firstly proposed to estimate the internal temperature of the cell based on the zero-intercept frequency (ZIF) method, where ZIF is the frequency when the imaginary part of the impedance in the electrochemical impedance spectrum is zero, because ZIF is closely related to cell internal temperature and is not affected by SOC. Then, in order to avoid the interference of current flowing through the cell and improve the prediction accuracy of the model, a method to estimate the internal tem- perature of the battery based on the non-ZIF method was pro- posed [54], so thermal runaway could be effective prevention. Dong et al. [55] proposed a 2-stage thermal runaway early warning method based on EIS in 3 frequency ranges. At the first stage, the thermal runaway warning is realized on the basis of the high sensitivity of the EIS mid-frequency band and the internal temperature rise of the cell. At the second stage, sudden changes in high- and low-frequency bands caused by cell defor- mation could be used for early warning. Carkhuff et al. [56] used a multifrequency impedance meter to create a small and low-power battery internal temperature sensor BMS, which has the ability to monitor phase shift and amplitude so that the inter- nal temperature of each cell can be monitored simultaneously.

TR, thermal runaway.Downloaded from https://spj.science.org on August 09, 2023 Zhang et al. 2023 | https://doi.org/10.34133/energymatadv.0008 6 Lyu et al. [57] pointed out in the latest research that when the cell is overcharged at the beginning, the slope of the dynamic impedance of the cell in the frequency band of 30 to 90 Hz will gradually change from negative to positive. This is because the dynamic impedance decreases as the battery temperature increases under normal charging [51,53]. However, the electro- lyte will be filled with bubbles after overcharging [8], resulting in a decrease in the conductivity and relative permittivity of the electrolyte. At the same time, an increase in the electrode spac- ing will cause the increase of resistance R and the decrease of capacitance C, resulting in a sudden increase in impedance |Z|. Since this impedance change is much earlier than the occur- rence of thermal runaway, cell overcharge and possible thermal runaway can be predicted based on this characteristic. Thermal Runaway Detection and Early Warning Based on Big Data Nowadays, there are many new energy vehicle data centers in various places, which store a large amount of historical data such as the current, voltage, and temperature of new energy vehicles. Therefore, the battery thermal runaway mode learned from a large number of historical data can be used for early warning. Generally, methods based on big data have the poten- tial to improve their generalization performance. In addition, the experiment accumulated a large amount of laboratory ther- mal runaway data through fault injection, acupuncture, colli- sion, etc. The effectiveness of data-driven algorithms can be verified laterally. At present, the main research methods are shown in Fig. 6. Methods based on case analysis of real-vehicle data A temperature sensor, a voltage sensor, and a current sensor are usually arranged in the power battery pack, and the data of T, U, and I can be collected in real time. These data are uploaded to the vehicle BMS through the CAN bus and uploaded to the local cloud server by the T-box. Therefore, the runaway char- acterization of the battery can be analyzed through big histor- ical data of thermally runaway vehicles. Through a real case of thermal runaway of new energy vehicles, Gao et al. [58] ana- lyzed the thermal runaway process of the battery and the key time nodes of a thermal runaway instance, such as the abnormal starting point of voltage and temperature. The article proposes that thermal runaway is caused by the ISC and overcharge of the battery. In addition, the article analyzes the abnormal mode of cell voltage of ESC, ISC, and poor signal line connection and gives a specific example to illustrate the changes of the voltage of each cell and the temperature of each probe in the module with time during thermal runaway. For ESC faults, they can be detected by comparing direct current to sensor mea surements, with thresholds for current increase, voltage increase drop, and temperature rise [59,60]. A limitation of this approach is the possibility of failure without triggering the threshold. Hinton et al. [61] proposed a signal- based fault diagnosis method for power battery ESC, including signal analysis to eliminate the effect of state inconsistency on time series feature extraction, feature fusion and manifold learn- ing for dimensionality reduction, and clustering-based outliers Point detection is used to identify abnormal signal features. Through correction, it can effectively solve the problem that the threshold value of multidimensional fusion features is difficult to determine. In addition, the article sets up multiambient- temperature, multi-SOC experiments to compare with each other, illustrating the effectiveness of the method. Methods based on information analysis Voltage anomalies before thermal runaway usually indicate deeper internal faults such as ISCs, structural failures, etc. In order to meet the power and capacity requirements of power batteries, battery cells are usually combined in parallel or in series. However, because of the inconsistency of temperature [62,63], the inconsistency of battery capacity will increase. On the one hand, the capacity degradation between cells will lead to enhanced voltage inconsistency, and on the other hand, loose connections will increase contact resistance, which further exac- erbates the inconsistency of battery characterization, which is also an important cause of thermal runaway [59,60]. Therefore, the analysis of battery pack voltage data is of great significance for the prediction of thermal runaway of electric vehicles. While Shannon entropy [64] can describe this voltage anomaly behavior well on limited data [65], Wang et al. [66] proposed a voltage anomaly detection method based on mod- ified Shannon entropy seen in Eq. 1 and then compared the similarities and differences between Shannon entropy [67] and sample entropy [68] according to data in China New Energy Vehicle Data Center (Beijing), and the z-score method seen Eq. 2 is used to determine the threshold of the anomaly coeffi- cient. It is worth noting that, for the real-time performance of the algorithm, a sliding window method is used to update and describe the voltage evolution process of each battery cell. Similarly, Hong et al. [69] systematically introduced the imple- mentation of the thermal management system of the battery pack and the safety range of the battery and also proposed a prediction scheme for the thermal runaway of the battery sys- tem of an electric vehicle using another entropy method seen in Eq. 3. The time and location of temperature failures inside the battery pack can be accurately predicted when arranged.

Singh et al. [70] stated that changes in temperature and changes in battery-related parameters are important indicators to dis- tinguish ISC faults. In addition to information entropy and threshold, the correlation coefficient in Eq. 4 can also describe the inconsistency of battery pack voltage cells well. Xia et al. [71] considered the correlation of long-term historical data and the validity of the update amount, and a sliding window is used to process the temporal data, which is verified on the basis of the experimental data. In addition to voltage, Xia et al. [72] stated that, for the battery module, the ISC detection of the battery cells can be carried out by analyzing the current difference of the parallel battery branches. However, electric vehicles only set a unique current sensor on the bus. Connecting a current sensor in series for each parallel group will increase the BMS cost, making this method challenging to apply to real vehicles. Thermal runaway analysis method based on fault injection In addition to directly analyzing the thermal runaway data of the real vehicle, triggering the real thermal runaway or constructing a thermal runaway simulation model can also analyze the causes of the thermal runaway of the power battery. It can be triggered by indentation [73,74], puncture [75,76], tectonic defect struc- tures [77,78], and extreme temperatures [79].

[80] conducted a lithium-ion battery abuse test under electronic stability control at 3 ambient temperatures, revealing the effect of battery SOC and ambient temperature on the maximum temperature rise. The temperature-rise character- istics of lithium-ion batteries are analyzed through experimental data, and leakage is the external manifestation of the latter. The author proposed a model combining a fractional-order model (FOM) and an ESC diagnosis model. The ESC fault and even electrolyte leakage could be identified through a combination of FOM and ESC diagnosis model, as shown in Fig. 7. It is proved that the 2 heat generation modes are linearly separable in the temperature rise and flow plane, and a 2-step prediction method of maximum temperature rise based on support vector machines is proposed [81,82]. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by experimental data. In addition to experimental methods, the performance of each cell of an actual vehicle battery under thermal runaway can also be simulated by establishing a thermal coupling model of the power battery. The biggest contribution of is to establish an efficient thermally coupled equivalent circuit model of the battery pack and open-source it on MATLAB [83]. This model combines a battery heat generation model [84], which is coupled with a series connection equivalent circuit model [85,86]. In addition, the model takes into account the interaction between the convective heat transfer between the battery cells on the temperature and voltage characterization of the battery cells. It is worth mentioning that the model can be effectively extended to the mode of ESC and ISC of the battery pack. In short, the thermal runaway prediction method based on fault injection allows scholars to explore the impact of specific battery thermal runaway incentives on the collected signals of battery sensors from another aspect and sort them out. However, most of the data sources in this way are equiv- alent circuit model simulation data, battery thermal runaway trigger experiments, or a combination of the two. Although the model and trigger mode are constantly improved, this series of methods is still full of challenges in the face of the real-vehicle data thermal runaway early warning task. Thermal runaway prediction method based on advanced machine learning methods This part focuses on the prediction method of thermal runaway of lithium-ion battery based on machine learning. It should be noted that some documents in the previous chapters also use machine learning tools, which will not be described here. The observer based on an electrochemical model and fuzzy logic [16] algorithm are used to reliably detect faults in lithium- ion batteries [17]. The internal parameter residuals calculated by the observer based on the electrochemical model and fuzzy logic algorithm are used to reliably detect various internal faults of lithium-ion battery, such as overcharge, overdischarge, and battery aging.

[87] use long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the voltage of battery system in multiple steps, and the correlation coefficient method is used to judge the accuracy of voltage prediction by various factors. Combined with the alarm or alarm threshold, the feasibility, stability, and reliability of the proposed voltage anomaly prediction models are verified by the actual operation data as shown in Fig. 8. Ding et al. [88] used an innovative meta-learning approach [89] to estimate the thermal runaway problem at the cell level. Specifically, Ding described the prediction task as a classification task with extremely unbalanced data and then proposed a meta-thermal runaway prediction neural network to solve this problem, as shown in Fig. 9. For thermal imaging changes when the battery is thermally out of control, Robinson et al. [90] proposed in that the aver- age cell temperature increases with significant spatial variation of cell length, suggesting that high-dimensional thermal images can capture more accurate and representative thermal distributions in space and time. Therefore, the algorithm inno- vatively uses high-dimensional thermal field images of lithium- ion batteries and performs cross-modal aggregation with low-latitude current and voltage data based on visual attention [91]. On the basis of the above extraction process of battery features, FSL algorithms learns the similarity measure of bat- tery thermal runaway pattern, using the querying method to classify whether thermal runaway occurs. However, this method also has drawbacks. The ablation experiment shows that the similarity measure between the thermal images of the normal working mode of the battery is easy to be learned, but the effect of low-dimensional data is limited. In practical applications, there are usually only a lim- ited number of temperature probes and current and voltage sensors, and the characterization information of such operat- ing conditions and voltages is complex, and its similarity mea- sure is difficult to learn. In addition, whether the thermal imaging image data of each monomer can be directly obtained also increases the difficulty for the implementation of the algorithm. Discussion and Conclusion High safety is a critical feature for the promotion of electric vehicles, and the thermal runaway risk of lithium-ion bat- teries determines the safety of electric vehicles. In this paper, the thermal runaway mechanism of lithium-ion batteries is expounded, and a variety of thermal runaway predictions and early warning methods for lithium-ion batteries are sum- marized and analyzed. The causes of thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries are mainly divided into mechanical abuse, electrical abuse, and thermal abuse. In the process of thermal runaway caused by these 3 abuse conditions, a series of uncontrollable exothermic reactions are the key to causing thermal runaway, including the decomposition of SEI, the reaction between the anode and the electrolyte, the reaction between the cathode and the electro- lyte, the decomposition of the electrolyte, etc. In addition, the thermodynamic parameters such as the initial temperature, heat release rate, and heat release amount of each side reaction are summarized, which lays a theoretical foundation for the production design of lithium-ion batteries and the develop- ment of thermal runaway prediction methods. The thermal runaway prediction and early warning methods of lithium-ion batteries are mainly established on the basis of battery electrochemical mechanisms and battery big data. In terms of the thermal runaway prediction and early warning methods established on the basis of the electrochemical mech- anism of the cell, the battery heat generation is calculated by the coupled electrochemical–thermal model, and the battery thermal runaway boundary is determined on the basis of the battery operating conditions. In addition, by measuring the gas generation of the battery in the early stage of thermal runaway, the thermal runaway warning of lithium-ion battery cells and Downloaded from https://spj.science.org on August 09, 2023 Zhang et al. 2023 | https://doi.org/10.34133/energymatadv.0008 9 battery packs, including CO2, CO, etc., can be realized on the monitoring of gas concentration. Moreover, the thermal run- away warning is carried out according to the electrochemical impedance spectrum characteristics of lithium-ion batteries, including estimating the real-time temperature inside the battery with phase shift, ZIF, non-ZIF, etc. and detecting battery overcharging with the characteristic that the dynamic imped- ance slope changes from negative to positive in a specific fre- quency range so as to prevent the occurrence of battery thermal runaway accidents.

From the direct analysis of V, I, and T to small sample learning on multimodal data, the algorithm becomes more and more robust. There are also various ways of obtaining thermal runaway data by arti- ficial intelligence methods, such as real- vehicle data, thermal runaway experimental data, fault injection simulation data, and so on. However, the power battery fault diagnosis algorithm based on big data faces the following problems. The battery is a complex time-varying system, and the threshold parameter boundary will change with the type and aging of the battery. The mobility of the model is worth exploring. Research based on experimental thermal runaway data decouples the causes of thermal runaway to a certain extent, but there is a big gap between this ideal data and real- vehicle data. Unfortunately, there is currently no stable algorithm to predict thermal run- away based on real-vehicle data. In order to establish an accurate and widely applicable ther- mal runaway prediction and early warning method for Li-ion cells, a multiscale method combined with external character- istics (temperature, voltage, current) and internal mechanism (electrochemical reaction and material changes) should be built to analyze the electrochemical–thermal coupling characteris- tics of lithium-ion batteries during the evolution of thermal runaway. Moreover, the quantitative law between the gradual change of electrochemical parameters and the risk of thermal runaway should be constructed. Moreover, safety boundaries should be constructed on the basis of electrochemical param- eters, so the quantitative assessment and prediction of thermal runaway risk of lithium-ion batteries can be achieved. Although some achievements have been made in lithium- ion battery safety research in recent years, there is still a long way to go in the research on thermal runaway prediction and early warning of lithium-ion batteries, which requires the inte- gration of electrochemistry, thermodynamics, artificial intel- ligence, and other subjects, so that an accurate and widely applicable lithium-ion battery thermal runaway prediction and early warning method can be established. The methods will reduce the probability of electric vehicle spontaneous combus- tion accidents, improve the market acceptance of electric vehi- cles, and promote the development of the electric vehicle industry.
