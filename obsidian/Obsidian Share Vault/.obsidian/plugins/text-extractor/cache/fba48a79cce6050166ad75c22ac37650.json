{"path":"work/QCELLs offboarding/attachments/PeopleConnect cover 240822.pdf","text":"Hello, 8/22/2024 Arguably, one of my best qualifications for this job is that I’ve had a lot of ear infections -- and several childhood ear surgeries. I’d love to help out today’s little kids. But besides having had ear problems, I also have a lot of experience with medical engineering – I worked for GE and Siemens as an ultrasound systems engineer, doing hardware/software path design for signal and image processing, as well as writing parts of the product signal processing code, ASIC tests, and contributing to clinical trials. The work was very gratifying. You’ll see on my resume that I’ve much since then, so I’ll just keep it short here, and say that I’m fascinated by medicine and machine learning, and that I love working in teams, especially leading them, while keeping sharp by doing some of the technical work myself. Sincerely, Scott Otterson 2836 NW 63rd St. Seattle, WA 98108","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
