Following the release, managerial discussions of GAI in conference calls increase substantially, and the increase is more pronounced for firms with greater innovation intensity, cybersecurity threats, product differentiation, labor exposure to AI, and customer operations, suggesting that these firms are more likely to be affected by GAI. Managers tend to believe that GAI is more beneficial to firms with greater innovation intensity and cybersecurity threats but is more detrimental to firms with greater product differentiation. While they hold mixed views on GAI’s impact on firms with greater labor exposure to AI and customer operations, their views are more likely to be positive than negative. Managers of firms with greater innovation intensity, cybersecurity threats and customer operations (product differentiation) increase initiative-related (non-initiative-related) discussions more. While managers of firms with greater labor exposure to AI increase discussions of both types more, they are more likely to increase initiative-related discussions. Overall, our study sheds light on the heterogeneous corporate perceptions of GAI’s impacts and responses. JEL Classification: K4; M4 Keywords: generative AI, ChatGPT, conference call, innovation, cybersecurity, product differentiation, labor exposure to AI, customer operations 1 1 Introduction Disruptive technologies can have a profound impact on business activities and cause major changes to industries and markets. The advent of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI or GAI) was the most recent example of this phenomenon. GAI, hallmarked by the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, utilizes machine learning algorithms as well as natural language processing to allow users to have human-like conversations with the technology and allow for the creation of original content by learning from massive amounts of data. ChatGPT took the world by storm, gaining over 1 million registered users in just 5 days and 100 million users in 2 months. 1 It has also drawn wide attention to GAI from the public and the business community. 2 The majority of CEOs believe that GAI will fundamentally change how companies operate, and are contemplating of using GAI tools to enhance corporate competitiveness and performance (Deloitte, 2023). Despite being the center of attention, the economic impact of GAI on corporations is not well understood. In particular, it is unclear what types of firms are more likely to be impacted by GAI and, perhaps more importantly, how they will be impacted. While the actual economic impact of GAI remains to be seen over time, in this paper we provide early evidence for these questions through the lens of corporate responses and attitudes toward GAI. We use managerial discussions of GAI in conference calls following the release of ChatGPT to infer corporate responses to GAI, and address two questions: (1) Managers of which types of firms are more likely to increase GAI-related discussions in conference calls? (2) What are the content features of managers’ discussions? Specifically, are their perspectives of GAI positive or negative, and do their discussions entail concrete action initiatives? The resource-based view conceptualizes firms as collections of resources and capabilities 1 https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/ 2 The Google search for “Generative AI/General Artificial Intelligence” surged sharply after the release of ChatGPT and continued to grow until the end of our examination window, June 2023 (see Figure 1). 2 that are managed dynamically to earn economic rents (Wernerfelt, 1984; Williams, 1994). We follow this framework to consider how GAI likely affects firms through its impacts on key dimensions of corporate resources and capabilities. We examine five dimensions—innovation, cybersecurity, product, labor, and customer operations. If managers perceive that their firms are potentially affected by GAI along these dimensions, they are more likely to increase GAI- related discussions in the conference calls following the release of ChatGPT. Innovation is a key driver of firm productivity and competitiveness (Gustavo, 2011; Hall et al., 2005; Cong and Howell, 2021). GAI can benefit corporate innovation in multiple ways, such as assisting researchers in idea generation, quickly prototyping and iterating on ideas, and freeing up researchers to focus on higher-level innovation activities (McKinsey, 2023). We explore how GAI affects firms through its impact on innovation by examining how managers of firms with higher innovation intensity change their GAI-related discussions in conference calls following the release of ChatGPT relative to those of other firms. The prediction is ambiguous ex ante because it is unclear whether GAI would relatively enhance the innovative advantage of innovation-intensive or non-innovation-intensive firms. Empirically, we measure a firm’s innovation intensity by its patent applications (e.g., Gustavo, 2011; Fang et al., 2014). Cybersecurity, a firm’s ability to protect critical systems and proprietary information from cyber-attacks, is crucial to competitive edge (Mckinsey, 2021). Prior studies have shown that cybersecurity incidents have material negative effects on target firms (Li et al., 2016; He et al., 2019; Amir et al., 2018; Kamiya et al., 2021). GAI can affect a firm’s cybersecurity positively or negatively—it can enhance the firm’s ability to identify and combat cybersecurity threats, but it can also help attackers launch sophisticated and novel attacks. To understand the impact of GAI on firms through cybersecurity, we investigate how managers of firms facing greater cybersecurity threats adjust their GAI-related discussions in conference calls relative to those of other firms following ChatGPT’s release. Ex ante, the prediction is also ambiguous because 3 it is uncertain whether firms with higher or lower cybersecurity threats are affected more by GAI regarding their cybersecurity, and in which direction. Empirically, we measure a firm’s cybersecurity threats with a cyber-risk measure constructed based on the textual analysis of the firm’s 10-K filing (Florackis et al., 2023). A firm’s ability to produce merchandizes that customers value more than those produced by competitors is also a key source of competitive advantage and above-normal economic returns (Saloner et al., 2001). GAI has the potential to improve product development, leading to more unique and competitive products. We explore how GAI affects firms through its impact on product competitiveness by examining how managers of firms with greater product differentiation change GAI-related discussions in conference calls relative to those of other firms following the release of ChatGPT. This is an open empirical question because it is unclear whether GAI would relatively increase the product competitiveness of firms with unique or homogenous products. Empirically, we follow Hoberg and Phillips (2016) to measure a firm’s product differentiation by one minus the median product similarity of the focal firm and peer firms. Labor is another key corporate resource and production input, especially in labor-intensive industries. GAI (and AI in general) is widely perceived to have great potential to substitute human labor and increase labor productivity (McKinsey, 2023; Brynjolfsson et al., 2023). However, the development of GAI could also impact labor productivity negatively. For example, the resulting job insecurity could impose new workplace challenges for employees such as increased stress, lower organizational commitment, and decreased incentives for human capital investment (Dekker and Schaufeli, 1995; Brougham and Haar, 2018). To investigate the influence of GAI on firms through its effect on labor, we examine how managers of firms with higher labor exposure to AI—the extent to which a firm’s labor is affected by AI—adjust GAI-related discussions in conference calls after the launch of ChatGPT relative to those of 4 other firms. We expect firms with higher labor exposure to AI to be more affected by GAI and thus their managers would increase GAI-related discussions more than those of other firms, whereas the direction of perceived impact is unclear. Empirically, we measure the degree of labor exposure to AI using the measure of industry-level occupational exposure to AI developed by Felten et al. (2021). Prior research has highlighted the importance of customer satisfaction and retention to firm performance (Fornell et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2004). GAI has the potential to revolutionize the entire customer operations function, improving agent productivity through digital self- service and enhancing and augmenting agent skills (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023). However, there are also concerns about the risks of using GAI in customer service, such as providing false information, alienating different segments of customer base, and the lack of compassion and empathy (Froehlich, 2023). We explore how GAI affects firms through its impact on customer operations by examining how managers of firms with more customer operations change GAI- related discussions in conference calls relative to those of other firms following the release of ChatGPT. We expect firms with more customer operations to be more affected by GAI through the customer channel and thus their managers would increase GAI-related discussions more than those of other firms. However, the direction of perceived impact is unclear. Empirically, we measure the intensity of customer operations using whether a firm primarily operates in the retail or service sector. Our main analyses are based on a sample of 6,163 conference calls by 2,015 public firms between November 30, 2022, and May 27, 2023. To identify GAI-related discussions in each conference call, we first search the entire call transcript for GAI-related keywords, and then for each keyword hit, we manually read sentences around the keyword to extract all GAI-related sentences. The percentage of conference calls containing GAI-related discussions increased sharply after the launch of ChatGPT from 0.34% in the third quarter of 2022 to 9.25% in the 5 second quarter of 2023 (see Figure 2), indicating that managers promptly respond to this revolutionary milestone in GAI’s development. Next, we address our first research question: Managers of which types of firms are more likely to increase GAI-related discussions in conference calls? We measure the extent of managers’ GAI-related discussions in a conference call with the percentage of GAI-related sentences in managers’ presentation and answers to analysts’ questions. To capture the increase in GAI-related discussions, we subtract the average of the same percentage measure among conference calls of the same firm in the one-year period before the release of ChatGPT (between November 30, 2021 and November 29, 2022). We find that following the release of ChatGPT, firms with greater innovation, cybersecurity threats, product differentiation, labor exposure to AI, and customer operations experience a larger increase in GAI-related discussions in subsequent conference calls. These results imply that such firms are more likely to be affected by GAI. The economic effect associated with a one-standard-deviation increase in the measure of innovation intensity (cybersecurity threats, product differentiation, labor exposure) accounts for 35% (21%, 16%, 43%) of the average increase in GAI-related discussions of the sample; the effect of high customer operations industries accounts for 245% of the sample average increase. To address our second research question—the content features of managers’ GAI-related discussions, we examine the discussion sentiment and whether the discussions entail concrete action initiatives. To measure the discussion sentiment, we conduct a textual analysis of managers’ discussion tone and classify it into either positive, negative, or neutral. We find that managers at firms with greater innovation intensity and cybersecurity threats increase positive- tone GAI-related discussions more, but not negative- or neutral-tone ones. These findings suggest that managers generally believe that GAI is more beneficial for firms with greater innovation intensity and cybersecurity threats, presumably because it can help these firms 6 enhance their innovation advantages and cybersecurity. In contrast, managers at firms with greater product differentiation are more predisposed to increase negative- or neutral-tone GAI-related discussions, but not positive-tone ones. This finding suggests that managers perceive GAI to be more detrimental to firms that currently enjoy a competitive advantage arising from unique product offerings, presumably because GAI may help firms with homogeneous products to enhance product development more. For firms operating in industries with higher labor exposure to AI and customer operations, managers’ views appear to be mixed—managers at these firms are more likely to increase GAI-related discussions of all three tones. These findings are consistent with our above arguments that GAI could impact these firms either positively or negatively. However, the results for positive-tone discussions are stronger than those for negative-tone ones, suggesting the perspectives of managers of those firms are more likely to be positive than negative. Next, we explore whether managers’ GAI-related discussions involve action initiatives or merely broad remarks (e.g., Balakrishnan et al., 2023). To that end, we use GPT-4 to identify whether the discussions contain any action initiatives. We find that managers at firms with greater innovation intensity, cybersecurity threats, and customer operations increase initiative- related discussions of GAI more, but not general discussions. In contrast, managers of firms with higher product differentiation increase general discussions of GAI more, but not initiative- related ones. In addition, managers of firms operating in industries with higher labor exposure to AI increase discussions of both types more, but they are more likely to increase initiative- related discussions. Our findings are robust to measuring managerial responses using the level of managers’ GAI-related discussions in conference calls, instead of the change, after the launch of ChatGPT, as well as to changing the measurement of GAI-related discussions from the sentence level to the word level. Our analysis of innovation intensity, cybersecurity, and product differentiation 7 above is based on both within-industry and between-industry variations. We further perform a within-industry analysis by including industry fixed effects. The evidence suggests that the effect of product differentiation we document above is mainly driven by cross-industry variations instead of within-industry variations, while within-industry variations of innovation intensity (cybersecurity threats) also contribute to all (some) results documented for this factor. In addition, we find that managers’ GAI-related discussions are informative to the capital market—the discussions are associated with greater market reactions and higher abnormal trading volume. Lastly, we explore whether managers’ views of GAI’s corporate impact are consistent with those of financial analysts and investors. We find that analysts’ perceptions of GAI’s impact, reflected in their GAI-related discussions in conference calls, are largely consistent with those of managers, except that they appear to not consider innovation intensity or product differentiation. To examine investors’ perceptions, we use market reactions to the launch of ChatGPT to proxy for investors’ perception of GAI’s corporate impact, and find that managers of firms with higher perceived impact are significantly more likely to increase GAI-related discussions in subsequent conference calls. However, the relationship is no longer significant after we include the five channels we examine above, suggesting that they have captured part of investors’ perception of the main channels through which GAI affects firms. Our paper adds to the nascent literature on the economic impacts of GAI. Given the revolutionary nature of ChatGPT, it is not surprising that economic and business scholars as well as industry practitioners have immediately attempted to understand its impacts and the impacts of GAI in general from various angles. Regarding GAI’s corporate impacts, concurrent studies have examined its overall valuation impact (e.g., Eisfeldt et al., 2023; Bertomeu et al., 2023) and productivity impact in specific settings (e.g., Yilmaz et al., 2023; Brynjolfsson et al., 8 2023; Gilardi et al., 2023; Noy and Zhang, 2023).3 We take a new approach and assess GAI’s impact through the lens of corporate managers’ opinions and responses in conference calls. Unlike concurrent studies focusing on a specific channel, we examine a relatively comprehensive set of channels through which GAI can impact firms, including innovation, cybersecurity, product, labor, and customer. Moreover, we show not only what types of firms are more likely affected by GAI (based on managers’ perceptions), but also how those firms are affected. Analysis of discussion content also sheds light on which types of firms have disclosed actions to embrace GAI. While the longer-term economic impacts of GAI have yet to be seen, our study complements existing academic work and practitioner surveys (e.g., McKinsey, 2023; Bain, 2023) to provide early insights into its potential influences. 2 Background, Literature Review, and Conceptual Development 2.1 Background of Generative AI Adopting AI for human activities has a long history. In 1954 IBM made the first public demonstration of a machine translation system (Zhang et al., 2023). However, it was not until November 2022 that OpenAI captured the imagination of people around the world by introducing a disruptive AI product, known as ChatGPT. This GAI application has emerged from foundation models—large-scale, deep learning models trained on massive, broad, structured and unstructured datasets (text, voice, etc.) that cover a wide range of topics. Unlike traditional AI tools that are designed to summarize patterns and make predictions, GAI has the ability to create novel contexts for a broad range of use cases, with little fine-tuning required for each case. For example, ChatGPT has been used to translate text and to create novel protein sequences. The power of ChatGPT’s capabilities is accessible to all, including people with little computer literacy and technical background. 3 We review the related literature in Section 2.2. 9 Due to its wide applications and low usage barrier, GAI is widely perceived to have a pervasive and profound impact on the society and economy. It has the potential to reshape how knowledge work is done in industries and business functions across the entire economy. Across functions such as sales and marketing, product development, and innovation activities, it is poised to transform roles and boost performance (McKinsey, 2023). As a result, the release of ChatGPT has received wide public attention to this product and to GAI. Figure 1 presents the time-series trend of worldwide Google search interest index for the phrase “ChatGPT”, “GPT”, and “Generative AI/Generative Artificial Intelligence”. The search interest surged sharply after the release of ChatGPT and continued to grow until the end of our examination window, June 2023. Because of its enormous value and impact, GAI has been attracting the interest of investors and corporations. The funding for GAI has been growing rapidly—reaching a total of $12 billion in the first five months of 2023 alone (McKinsey, 2023). More companies are investing in developing their own GAI products. Among the major players, Microsoft has reportedly invested $10 billion in OpenAI and its ChatGPT. In early March 2023, Salesforce announced a plan to introduce a ChatGPT app in its popular Slack product. In December 2023, Google introduced its GAI product, Gemini. Despite the awe-inspiring development of GAI, this technology is not without challenges and limitations. For example, the accuracy of the results can be questionable. GAI tools can confidently generate entirely inaccurate information in response to a user question and have no built-in mechanism to signal this to the user or challenge the result. Another concern is systemic biases in results as GAI tools are trained on massive amounts of data that might include unwanted biases (Chilton, 2023). 2.2 Related Literature Given the significance of GAI, a nascent literature begins to examine its impacts on 10 businesses, especially after the launch of ChatGPT. One stream of research assesses GAI’s overall corporate impact via its capital market effects (Eisfeldt et al., 2023; Bertomeu et al., 2023). Eisfeldt et al. (2023) focus on the valuation implication of a particular type of firm exposure to GAI—workforce exposure. Using a portfolio strategy, they find that higher- exposure firms earn higher excess returns compared to lower-exposure firms. They conclude from this evidence that the release of ChatGPT was generally viewed by investors as good news for more exposed firms. However, they also find that there is wide variation in investor perceptions across and within industries, consistent with the substantive disruptive potential of GAI. Capitalizing on an exogenous ban on ChatGPT usage in Italy between March and April 2023, Bertomeu et al. (2023) examine the market-wide valuation impact of GAI. They find that Italian public firms experience a significant stock price decline surrounding the event, and the effect is stronger for industries that are more exposed to GAI. Their evidence suggests that ChatGPT is generally perceived by the market as value increasing. Another stream of research examines the productivity impact of GAI, usually focusing on how GAI performs compared to human and how it improves labor productivity in a specific setting (e.g., Gilardi et al., 2023; Brynjolfsson et al., 2023; Yilmaz et al., 2023; Noy and Zhang, 2023; Kreitmeir and Raschky, 2023). Yilmaz et al. (2023) use Google’s introduction of neural network-based translation (GNNT), a type of GAI-based application, as a natural experiment to examine the substitution of human translators by AI. They find that the introduction of GNNT reduces the number of human translation transactions. Brynjolfsson et al. (2023) examine the impact of GAI-based tools on labor productivity in customer support activities. They find that customer support agents utilizing the AI tools experience a significant increase in productivity as reflected in the number of customer issues resolved per hour. Using a sample of tweets, Gilardi et al. (2023) demonstrate that GAI outperforms crowd-workers for several 11 text-annotation tasks.4 2.3 Conceptual Development The resource-based view of a firm posits that heterogeneity in firm performance is attributed to variation in its resources and capabilities to achieve and sustain a competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984). From this perspective, we posit that GAI will likely impact firm performance through its impacts on corporate resources and capabilities. We examine five key dimensions—innovation, cybersecurity, product, labor, and customer operations. Below we discuss the potential impacts of GAI on these dimensions, and how managers of firms with varying characteristics along these dimensions would adjust their GAI- related discussions in conference calls differently following the release of ChatGPT. 2.3.1 Innovation Innovation is a key driver of corporate competitiveness and has been shown to positively affect corporate performance and valuation (Gustavo, 2011; Hall et al., 2005). GAI can benefit corporate innovation activities in multiple ways (Bilgram and Laarmann, 2023; Henry, 2023). It can improve and accelerate the process of exploration and ideation, facilitate prototyping and iterating on ideas at lower costs, and help researchers brainstorm and explore solutions to complex problems (Bilgram and Laarmann, 2023). It can also automate routine tasks such as data analysis, report generation, and content creation, freeing up human resources to focus on higher-level tasks related to innovation (Reed, 2022; Henry, 2023). We explore how GAI affects firms through its impact on innovation by examining how managers of firms with higher innovation intensity would adjust their GAI-related discussions following the release of ChatGPT compared to those of firms with lower innovation intensity. Ex ante it is unclear whether GAI’s innovation benefits are more valuable for firms with greater 4 Concurrent research also examines the applications of GAI or ChatGPT in various decision contexts such as return prediction and information summarizing (e.g., Lopez-Lira and Tang, 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023). 12 or less innovation. On the one hand, GAI could help less innovative firms to mitigate the innovation gap with more innovative firms, and is thus more beneficial for less innovative firms. On the other hand, GAI may be more beneficial for innovation-intensive firms by further extending their innovation advantages. Therefore, whether and how managers of firms with different innovation intensity would adjust their GAI-related discussions differently are open empirical questions. 2.3.2 Cybersecurity Business activities often entail a significant amount of proprietary data, knowledge, and processes which are important corporate resources. Prior studies show that cybersecurity incidents can lead to severe and adverse consequences on corporations (Li et al., 2016; He et al., 2019; Amir et al., 2018; Kamiya et al., 2021).5 Ex ante it is unclear whether GAI would reduce or exacerbate a firm’s cybersecurity threats because it can lead to both benefits and risks in cybersecurity (Campbell, 2023; Irei, 2023). Regarding the benefits, GAI can increase protection efficiency, improve threat detection, automate responses, and continuously monitor (Campbell, 2023). However, GAI can also introduce new cybersecurity risks by helping attackers launch sophisticated and novel attacks. For example, ChatGPT can be used to write malware and help malicious hackers build their skills (Irei, 2023).6 In addition, employees using GAI tools like ChatGPT could inadvertently put sensitive corporate information at risk.7 To understand the impact of GAI on firms in the context of cybersecurity, we investigate how managers of firms facing greater versus lower cybersecurity threats adjust their GAI- related discussions in conference calls differently following ChatGPT’s release. For the reasons 5 Cyberattacks in the manufacturing industry have costed American corporations about $360 billion annually (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2019). 6 For example, malicious hackers could request ChatGPT to create code for penetration testing, and then modify and repurpose it for use in cyber attacks (Irei, 2023). 7 For example, in April 2023, Samsung witnessed three separate leaks of sensitive company data with ChatGPT, including computer codes and meeting records. (source: https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/samsung- employees-reportedly-leaked-sensitive-info-chatgpt-accident) 13 discussed above, the prediction is ambiguous ex ante because it is unclear whether firms with higher or lower cybersecurity threats are affected more by GAI regarding their cybersecurity and in which direction. 2.3.3 Product A firm’s ability to produce merchandises that customers value more than those of competitors is a key source of competitive advantage (Saloner et al., 2001). GAI can be a powerful tool to improve the development of new products, features, and services (McKinsey, 2023; Forbes, 2023). For example, GAI can be used as a brainstorming partner to help generate new ideas for products and services, analyze the design data and suggest modifications on the initial design, identify customer needs and pain points, and facilitate the identification of potential improvements or new features for existing products or services (Bailey, 2023). Given the power of GAI in product development, it will likely intensify competition among firms. We focus on product differentiation to explore the influence of GAI on product development. Specifically, we examine how managers of firms with more differentiated products adjust their discussions about GAI in conference calls following the release of ChatGPT, compared to those of firms with lower production differentiation. On the one hand, GAI may be more beneficial to firms whose products are homogenous to their rivals’ by helping them enhance product differentiation and increase product competitiveness. On the other hand, it could strengthen product competitiveness of firms with unique products by helping them develop even more unique products, further eroding the market power of rivals that produce relatively homogenous products. Thus, it is an empirical question whether managers of firms with greater product differentiation would increase GAI-related discussions more and how they would respond. 2.3.4 Labor Labor is undoubtedly a crucial corporate resource and a fundamental input for production. 14 GAI is widely perceived to have great potential to substitute labor and increase labor productivity (McKinsey, 2023; Brynjolfsson et al., 2023; Yilmaz et al., 2023; Boyaci et al., 2024). However, what is less obvious is that GAI can also impose new workplace challenges that could adversely affect labor productivity and firm performance. When GAI is developing quickly, many employees have increasing concerns of job insecurity, which could lead to a deterioration of their psychological health, lower organizational commitment, and decreased incentives for human capital investment (Dekker and Schaufeli, 1995; Brougham and Haar, 2018). To investigate the influence of GAI on firms through its effect on labor, we examine how managers of firms whose labor is more affected by AI (higher labor exposure to AI) change their GAI-related discussions in conference calls relative to those other firms after ChatGPT’s release. Given the expected impact of GAI on labor, we expect that managers of firms with higher AI exposure are more likely to increase GAI-related discussions. However, based on the two-sided arguments above, it remains unclear whether their perspectives tend to be positive or negative and whether they are more likely to discuss concrete actions. 2.3.5 Customer operations A firm’s ability to satisfy customer needs and deliver value to them is key to create sustainable competitive advantage (Fornell et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2004). While GAI is generally believed to significantly impact customer operations, it is unclear whether it will always improve customer operations. On the one hand, GAI has the potential to revolutionize the entire customer operations function, improving agent productivity through digital self- service and enhancing agent skills (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023). It empowers firms to provide answers and solutions to customers faster, to delve into customer needs, predilections, and purchasing behaviors, thereby paving the way for more tailored marketing stratagems (BCG, 2023; Siggelkow and Terwiesch, 2023). On the other hand, there are also risks associated with using GAI in customer services. For instance, it can provide false or biased information, 15 alienate different segments of a firm’s customer base, and lack the compassion and empathy of a live customer agent, which could adversely affect customer operations (BCG, 2023; Froehlich, 2023). To understand the impact of GAI on businesses via its effects on customer operations, we explore how managers of firms with more extensive customer operations adjust their discussions about GAI in conference calls relative to those of other firms following the release of ChatGPT. We anticipate that managers of firms with greater customer operations will likely intensify their discussions about GAI more. Nevertheless, as previously discussed, it remains uncertain whether their viewpoints are predominantly positive or negative, and whether they are more likely to discuss concrete actions. 3 Sample Selection, Variable Construction, and Summary Statistics 3.1 Sample Selection Our sample comprises publicly listed companies on the NYSE and Nasdaq, with financial data accessible from Compustat. Initially, we consider the universe of 7,759 companies on Compustat, all of which have reported positive total assets for the fiscal year ending between November 29, 2021 and November 30, 2022 (the public launch date of ChatGPT). After deleting firms without SIC code, we narrow down the sample to 6,700 firms. Subsequently, we search these firms’ conference call transcripts in Capital IQ Transcript Database and successfully retrieve 10,404 calls corresponding to 3,671 firms, spanning the period of November 30, 2022, to May 27, 2023. Last, we exclude conference calls with missing variables for analysis, retaining a total of 6,163 transcripts for 2,015 firms. For stock return analysis, we further require the availability of stock price data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database. The sample selection procedures and attrition rates are tabulated in Appendix A. 16 3.2 Variable Construction 3.2.1 Management GAI-related Discussions To identify GAI-related discussions in conference calls, we first compile a list of GAI- related keywords along three dimensions–vendor, product, and technology. We posit that it is unlikely that managers would discuss GAI without mentioning any of these three dimensions. For vendor and product-related keywords, we identify leading GAI vendors by referencing several commercial rankings, and for each vendor, we obtain information about its entire product offerings from its official website. 8 For technology keywords, we first extract a preliminary list of keywords from Zhang et al. (2023), a computer science survey paper on GAI technology. We then ask three technology experts to independently select the keywords that they perceive to be highly relevant to GAI.9 We retain keywords that are chosen by at least two. The final keyword list is provided in Appendix B. For each conference call transcript, we search for the GAI-related keywords in the entire transcript and identify sentences that contain the keywords. We then manually read sentences around them to identify all GAI-related discussions. Hence, our final GAI-related sentences consist of both the keyword sentences and the relevant context. We provide in Appendix C, Panel A five examples of such discussions, pertaining to the five dimensions we examine— innovation, cybersecurity, product, labor, and customer operations. We next compute the percentage of GAI-related sentences relative to the aggregate sentence count in management discourses—the presentation and answers to analysts’ questions, and denote this variable as GAI%. To capture the change of GAI-related discussions following ChatGPT’s release, we subtract the average of GAI% among conference calls of the same firm between November 30, 8 We referenced several commercial rankings, including eWeek’s Generative AI Companies: Top 12 Leaders (https://www.eweek.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai-companies/) and CB Insights’ Gen AI: The Most Promising Generative Artificial Intelligence Startups of 2023 (https://www.cbinsights.com/research/generative- ai-top-startups-2023/). 9 Two are computer science professors of a leading university, whose research focuses on AI, and one Chief Technology Officer of a GAI firm. 17 2021, and November 29, 2022, and denote the change as ΔGAI%. 3.2.2 Innovation Intensity We use an output-based approach to measure innovation intensity, following Fang et al. (2014) and Bradley et al. (2017). Specifically, we calculate the annual average of the number of patent applications submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) by a firm and its subsidiaries in the past three calendar years and take a natural logarithm (after adding one). A higher value of this measure, denoted as Log Patents, implies greater engagement in innovative activities and/or a heightened efficacy in translating research and development undertakings into tangible outputs. 3.2.3 Cybersecurity Threats We assess cybersecurity threats by evaluating the likelihood that a firm might fall prey to cyberattacks using an approach based on Florackis et al. (2023). Specifically, we compare a firm’s description of its cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the “Item 1a. Risk Factors” section of its 10-K filing against the characteristics of all documented past cyberattacks of firms. A higher overlap (similarity) between the focal firm’s cybersecurity risk disclosure and traits of actual past cyberattacks suggests a higher possibility of real threats. We gather information on cybersecurity incidents from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse’s (PRC) Data Breach Chronology Database, focusing exclusively on incidents related to cyberattacks or hacking. The PRC database provides extensive details on each incident, such as the nature of the information compromised and the incident’s magnitude. We compile the descriptions of these incidents to create a reference point for evaluating real cybersecurity threats. Next, we extract statements related to cybersecurity from the “Item 1a. Risk Factors” section of a firm’s 10-K reports. We identify relevant disclosures by searching for specific keywords, as suggested by Florackis et al. (2023), such as “cyberattack”, “data breaches”, and “data theft.” We collect all sentences containing these keywords as cybersecurity disclosures 18 for each firm-year. Lastly, we calculate the cosine similarity between the text of the firm’s disclosures and the descriptions of real past cyber incidents in the PRC dataset. A higher similarity score suggests that the company’s disclosures closely match the details of actual cyberattacks, indicating a higher vulnerability to such threats. 3.2.4 Product Differentiation We measure product differentiation following Hoberg and Phillips (2016), which calculates a pairwise product similarity, for any pair of firms in a given year, as the cosine similarity of the textual content of the “Item 1. Business Description” segment from their 10- K filings. We download the pairwise product similarity from the Hoberg-Phillips Data Library, and create a peer group by counting the top-ten firms with the highest similarity scores to the focal firm. 10 Subsequently, we construct a firm-year metric for product differentiation, calculated as one minus the median cosine similarity score of the peer group. This measure is denoted as Product Differentiation. 3.2.5 Labor Exposure to AI We measure a firm’s labor force exposure to AI using the AI Industry Exposure (AIIE) developed by Felten et al. (2021).11 Felten et al. (2021) identify a set of common and well- developed applications of AI, relate these applications to abilities in workplace activities of each occupation, and develop a measure of an occupation’s exposure to AI technologies, which they call AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE). They validate the AIOE measure in several ways to establish its validity, for example, by showing that AIOE is positively associated with use of AI skills within an occupation based on the job postings. Due to the lack of firm-level occupation data for the construction of a firm-level AI exposure measure, we rely on the 10 The data is available at https://hobergphillips.tuck.dartmouth.edu/industryclass.htm. We are grateful to Gerard Hoberg and Gordon Phillips for sharing the data online. 11 The measure is available at https://github.com/AIOE-Data/AIOE.We thank the authors for making the data available. 19 industry-level measure provided by Felten et al. (2021), which is constructed by aggregating AIOEs across occupations within an industry (AIIE). This means that empirically we focus on between-industry variations of labor exposure to AI. We denote this measure as AIIE. 3.2.6 Customer Operations Due to the lack of individual customer data, we also rely on the industry-level variation to measure customer operations.12 We posit that firms in the retail and services industries entail greater customer operations than those in other industries (Verma, 2000; Wang, 2024). We identify retail and services industries based on 2-digit SIC industry codes. Specifically, we classify the retail industry by 2-digit SIC codes 52-59, and the service industry by 2-digit SIC codes 72, 73, and 78 (Cole et al., 2004). We define a variable Customer Operations that equals 1 if a firm is in a retail or services industry, and 0 otherwise. 3.3 Summary Statistics Table 1 presents the summary statistics for our sample. The mean of GAI% is 0.319, indicating that in the post-ChatGPT period 0.319% of managers’ discussions in conference calls are related to GAI. The mean of ΔGAI% is 0.308, which means relative to the benchmark period of one year before the launch of ChatGPT, GAI-related discussions increase by 0.308 percentage points on average. The difference between GAI% and ΔGAI% indicates that the average value of GAI% in the pre-ChatGPT period is only 0.011. The standard deviation of ΔGAI% is 1.675, indicating a large variation in managerial responses. Innovation intensity, Patents (unlogged), has a mean of 16.54 and a median of 0. Cybersecurity Threats has a mean and median of 0.692 and 0.696, respectively. The mean and median of Product Differentiation are 0.814 and 0.837. This suggests that, on average, the sample firms’ products are not similar to their peers. AIIE has a mean of 0.639, suggesting that on average 0.636 occupational 12 The data of major customers used in the literature to measure customer-base concentration (e.g., Patatoukas 2012; Crawford et al. 2020) is not help for our research purpose because we need to include small individual customers. 20 abilities/skills are related to AI applications at the industry level. 20.4% of observations are in retail and service industries (Customer Operations). The average firm-year has 13 analysts following, 76% institutional ownership, a book-to-market ratio of 0.399, and is 27 years old. The average total assets of sample firms are 17.7 billion dollars. 4 Managerial Responses to the Release of ChatGPT Regarding GAI 4.1 Determinants of Change in Managers’ GAI-Related Discussions Figure 2.A presents the quarterly distribution of the percentage of conference calls that contain GAI-related discussions over 2022 Q1 to 2023 Q2. Prior to 2023, on average only less than 1% of calls contained GAI-related discussions. The percentage surged sharply to around 10% in 2023 Q2, providing preliminary evidence that corporate managers significantly increased the discussions of GAI-related topics following the release of ChatGPT. Figure 2.B presents the quarterly distribution of GAI%. Its increasing trend resembles that in Figure 2.A. Table 2 reports the Pearson correlation between ΔGAI% and our independent variables of interest. ΔGAI% is significantly and positively associated with Log Patents, Cybersecurity Threats, Product Differentiation, AIIE, and Customer Operations, with the highest correlation of 0.24 with Customer Operations, and the lowest correlation of 0.04 with Product Differentiation. These correlations provide preliminary evidence that the increase in GAI- related discussions is more pronounced for firms with greater innovation, cybersecurity threats, product differentiation, labor exposure to AI, and customer operations. It is also worth noting that the correlation among the five factors we examine is not very high, with all magnitudes below 34%. To formally examine the determinants of changes in managers’ GAI-related discussions in conference calls surrounding the release of ChatGPT, we run a regression of ΔGAI% on the measures of the five dimensions through which GAI could impact firms, separately and 21 collectively: Δ𝐺𝐴𝐼%𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑋𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝜆𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡, (1) where the independent variable of interest, 𝑋𝑖,𝑡−1 , is Log Patents, Cybersecurity Threats, Product Differentiation, AIIE, or Customer Operations. Prior studies find that firms with greater investor interest are more likely to host conference calls (Frankel et al., 1999; Tasker, 1998). To control for investor information demand, we include Analyst Coverage, measured by the number of financial analysts following a firm, and Institutional Shareholding, measured by the percentage of shares outstanding owned by institutional investors. As prior studies find that firms with lower return volatility tend to provide more voluntary disclosures (Li, 2010), we also control for Abnormal Return Volatility, measured by the standard deviation of market- adjusted return. We also control for Firm Size, Book to Market, and Firm Age, which are documented in the prior literature to be related to corporate disclosures (Li et al., 2014). As AIIE and Customer Operations are measured at the industry level, we do not include industry fixed effects. However, given the profound association between high-tech industries and GAI, we include an indicator for the high-tech industry (High Tech Industry). We winsorize continuous variables at the 1 and 99 level and cluster the standard errors at the industry (3-digit SIC) level. Table 3 presents the estimation results. In Columns (1)-(5), the five firm/industry characteristics of interest, Log Patents, Cybersecurity Threats, Product Differentiation, AIIE, and Customer Operations, are included individually, and in Column (6) they are included simultaneously. To facilitate interpretation and comparison across regressions, in this and all subsequent analyses, we normalize ΔGAI%, Log Patents, Cybersecurity Threats, Product Differentiation, and AIIE, by subtracting the sample mean and then dividing by the standard deviation. We find that all five variables load positively and significantly, both individually and collectively. When all variables are included (Column (6)), Log Patents has a coefficient 22 of 0.066 (t-statistic = 2.06), Cybersecurity Threats has a coefficient of 0.040 (t-statistic = 1.99), Product Differentiation has a coefficient of 0.030 (t-statistic = 1.91), AIIE has a coefficient of 0.082 (t-statistic = 4.03), and Customer Operations has a coefficient of 0.467 (t-statistic = 3.74). These coefficients are also economically significant. A one-standard deviation increase of Log Patents corresponds to a 0.066 standard deviation increase in ΔGAI%. As the mean and standard deviation of ΔGAI% are 0.308 and 1.617, respectively, this effect accounts for a 35% increase (= 0.066×1.617/0.308) of the sample mean. Similar calculation suggests that a one- standard deviation increase in Cybersecurity Threats (Product Differentiation, AIIE) corresponds to an increase of ΔGAI% that accounts for 21% (16%, 43%) of its sample mean. As Customer Operations is an indicator variable, its coefficient 0.467 indicates that ΔGAI% is larger by 0.467 standard deviation in industries with high customer operations (retail and services industries) that other industries, which accounts for 245% (= 0.467×1.617/0.308) of the sample mean of ΔGAI%. Overall, the results in Table 3 indicate that the increase in managers’ GAI-related discussions in conference calls after the release of ChatGPT is larger for firms with greater innovation, cybersecurity threats, product differentiation, labor exposure to AI, and customer operations, suggesting that these firms are perceived by managers to be more impacted by GAI. Among the control variables, we find that managers of firms in high-tech industries, younger firms, and firms with lower institutional investor ownership increase the discussions of GAI more after ChatGPT’s release. Notably, the coefficient of High Tech Industry is much smaller than that of Customer Operations (and the difference is significant based on an untabulated test), suggesting that retail and services industries are more affected by GAI than high-tech industries. 4.2 Content of GAI-Related Discussions—Sentiment 23 While the analysis in Table 3 is informative about what types of firms are more affected by GAI, the directions of the impacts are unclear. To address this question, we explore the sentiment encompassed in manager’s GAI-related discussions. We classify the net sentiment of the GAI-related discussions in each call as positive, negative, and neutral, and then investigate how the measures of the five firm/industry characteristics we study are associated with the changes of GAI-related discussions with different tones. We utilize the lexicon introduced by Loughran and McDonald (2011) to ascertain the net sentiment of a call’s GAI- related discussions. A call with GAI-related discussions is categorized as having positive GAI discussions if the net sentiment is positive (above zero), neutral if the net sentiment equals zero, and negative if the net sentiment is negative (below zero). We present one example of discussions for each sentiment—positive, negative, and neutral—in Appendix C, Panel B. After measuring the net sentiment of a call’s GAI-related discussions, we decompose GAI% into GAI%-Positive, GAI%-Negative, and GAI%-Neutral. GAI%-Positive equals GAI% if the net sentiment of GAI-related discussions is positive, and zero otherwise. GAI%-Negative and GAI%-Neutral are defined in a similar fashion. As reported in Table 1, the means of GAI%- Positive, GAI%-Negative, and GAI%-Neutral are 0.266, 0.030, and 0.018, respectively, suggesting that GAI-related discussions mostly have positive net sentiment. Lastly, we calculate the change of GAI%-Positive by subtracting the average GAI%-Positive of the same firm in the pre-ChatGPT period (between November 30, 2021 and November 29, 2022), and denote the change as ΔGAI%-Positive. We define ΔGAI%-Negative and ΔGAI%-Neutral in a similar manner. As reported in Table 1, the means of ΔGAI%-Positive, ΔGAI%-Negative, and ΔGAI%-Neutral are 0.259, 0.029, and 0.018, respectively. We re-estimate Equation (1) using the three sentiment-based measures as the dependent variables. The findings are reported in Table 4. Again, we normalize the dependent variables and Log Patents, Cybersecurity Threats, and Product Differentiation, for easier interpretation 24 and coefficient comparison across the three specifications of sentiment-based measures. The coefficients of Log Patents and Cybersecurity Threats are positive and significant for ΔGAI%- Positive as the dependent variable (Column (1)), while they are insignificant for ΔGAI%- Negative (Column (2)) and ΔGAI%-Neutral (Column (3)). Furthermore, a coefficient comparison shows that the coefficients in the Columns (1) are significantly more positive than the corresponding ones in Column (2). These results indicate that for firms with greater innovation intensity and cybersecurity threats, managers generally express a positive attitude towards GAI in related discussions, suggesting that GAI tends to impact these firms positively. In contrast, for firms with greater product differentiation, managers are predisposed to increase negative or neutral GAI discussions but not positive ones, as evidenced by a positive and significant coefficient in Columns (2) and (3) and an insignificant coefficient in Column (1) on Product Differentiation. The difference between the coefficients in Columns (1) and (2), however, is insignificant. Firms with greater labor exposure to AI and customer operations are predisposed to offer GAI discussions in all tones, positive, negative, and neutral, as evidenced by the positive and significant coefficients on AIIE and Customer Operations in Columns (1)-(3). The results suggest that managers of these firms exhibit more diverse attitude towards GAI’s impacts. However, the coefficients of AIIE and Customer Operations are significantly more positive in Column (1) than in Column (2), which suggests that for firms with greater labor exposure to AI and customer operations, GAI’s impact is more likely to be positive than negative. These results, combined with the evidence delineated in Section 4.1, spotlight the multifaceted impacts of GAI on firms through innovation, cybersecurity, product differentiation, labor dynamics, and customer service realms. GAI is perceived by managers as more beneficial to more innovative firms, further enhancing their innovation edge, and to firms with greater cybersecurity threats, improving their cybersecurity protection. In contrast, GAI 25 is perceived by managers as more detrimental to firms with unique product offerings, possibly because GAI erodes their competitive edge by helping rivals to come up with more differentiated products. GAI’s perceived impact on labor and customer operations appears to be more divergent—it could be positive, negative, or neutral, whereas it is more likely to be positive than negative. 4.3 Content of GAI-Related Discussions—Initiative vs. Non-initiative When discussing GAI, managers may disclose concrete action initiatives or merely provide broad remarks without initiatives (e.g., Balakrishnan et al., 2023). Thus, we further investigate how the five firm/industry characteristics we study are associated with the changes of GAI-related initiative/non-initiative discussions. We use GPT-4 to identify whether a call’s GAI-related discussions contain GAI-related initiatives and manually verify the results using a random sample.13 GPT-4 performs fairly well in classifying initiative- vs. non-initiative-related discussions, achieving a machine-human consistency rate of 86%.14 Appendix C, Panel C provides examples of each type of discussions. After the classification, we follow a similar procedure as in Section 4.2 to calculate GAI-related discussions with initiatives, GAI%- Initiative, and discussions without initiatives, GAI%-NonInitiative, and their changes, ΔGAI%- Initiative and ΔGAI%-NonInitiative. As reported in Table 1, the means of GAI%-Initiative and GAI%-NonInitiative are 0.305 and 0.012, respectively, suggesting that most GAI-related discussions contain initiatives. With ΔGAI%-Initiative and ΔGAI%-NonInitiative as dependent variables, we re-estimate Equation (1) and report the results in Table 5. As in Tables 3 and 4, we normalize the dependent variables and Log Patents, Cybersecurity Threats, and Product Differentiation. As shown, the 13 We use the following prompt: “Tell me whether the following texts involve any real initiative related to generative AI? The format of your answers should be Yes or No. Text: {Insert the generative AI discussions here}” 14 We validate GPT-4’s classification with human classification by two research assistants, each examining a randomly selected subsample of GAI-related discussions. The research assistants are provided the same question as the ChatGPT prompt. The accuracy rate of GPT-4 coding benchmarked against human coding is 84% and 88% respectively for two research assistants. 26 coefficients on Log Patents, Cybersecurity Threats, and Customer Operations are significantly positive when ΔGAI%-Initiative is the dependent variable (Column (1)), but insignificant when ΔGAI%-NonInitiative is the dependent variable (Column (2)). Moreover, a coefficient comparison shows that the difference between each pair of corresponding coefficients is significant. These results suggest that for firms with greater innovation intensity, cybersecurity threats, and customer operations, managers increase GAI-related discussions with concrete action plans more after the release of ChatGPT, while there are no such associations for discussions without initiatives (i.e., broad remarks). In contrast, for firms with greater product differentiation, managers increase discussions without initiatives more, but not discussions with initiatives, as indicated by the significantly positive coefficient on Product Differentiation in Column (2) and the insignificant coefficient in Column (1). The difference between the two coefficients, however, is insignificant. The coefficients of AIIE are significantly positive in both columns, with the one in Column (1) significantly larger than that in Column (1). This result suggests that managers of firms with greater labor exposure to AI increase discussions of both types more after the release of ChatGPT, but increase initiative-related discussions more. 4.4 Additional Analyses In all regression analyses above, we use the change of GAI-related discussions or those with certain content features (sentiment and initiative) as the dependent variable to examine managers’ responses to the release of ChatGPT. To understand how managers discuss GAI cross-sectionally in the post-ChatGPT period, we use the level of discussions (e.g., GAI% and GAI%-Positive) as the dependent variable and repeat the analyses in Tables 3-5. As reported in Table 6, the results are generally consistent with those in Tables 3-5. Thus, all our conclusions regarding the change of GAI-related discussions or those with different content features hold for the level of discussions cross-sectionally in the post-ChatGPT period. 27 Next, we conduct a robustness test for the analyses in Tables 3-5 by measuring GAI-related discussions based on the number of words (as opposed to sentences) in the discussions relative to the total number of words in managers’ disclosures in a call. The results reported in Table 7 are also consistent with those in Tables 3-5. We do not include industry fixed effects in Equation (1) because AIIE and Customer Operations are measured at the industry level. Thus, our findings regarding innovation intensity, cybersecurity threats, and product differentiations are driven by both within- and between-industry variations. To explore whether within-industry variations of these three factors have similar effects, we incorporate industry (3-digit SIC) fixed effects in Equation (1). The findings are detailed in Table 8. Log Patents continues to have a significant and positive coefficient for ΔGAI%, ΔGAI%-Positive, and ΔGAI%-Initiative, and Cybersecurity Threats continues to load significantly and positively for ΔGAI%-Positive. The coefficients on Product Differentiation become negative but insignificant. These results suggest that the effect of product differentiation we document above is mainly driven by cross-industry variations instead of within-industry variations, while within-industry variations of innovation intensity also contribute to the results documented for GAI-related discussions and those of different types (sentiment and whether it contains initiatives). In addition, within-industry variations of cybersecurity threats also contribute to the results of positive-sentiment GAI-related discussions. Lastly, we examine market reactions to managers’ GAI-related discussions in conference calls to assess whether the discussions are informative to investors. We measure market reactions with the absolute value of three-day abnormal returns (|Call CAR|) and abnormal trading volume (Abnormal Trading Volume) centered around the conference call dates. We regress |Call CAR| and Abnormal Trading Volume on ΔGAI% and a set of control variables measured at the closest fiscal quarter (e.g., Bushee et al., 2011; Frankel et al., 1999) and report 28 the results in Table 9. 15 We find that changes in managers’ GAI-related discussions are significantly and positively associated with |Call CAR| and Abnormal Trading Volume, with a coefficient on ΔGAI% of 0.026 and 0.051, respectively, both significant at the 1% level, suggesting that managers’ GAI-related discussions are informative to investors. 5 Managers’ Perceptions of GAI against those of Financial Analysts and Investors Finally, we explore whether managers’ perceptions of GAI’s corporate impact are consistent with those of financial analysts and investors. We first examine whether the five firm/industry characteristics of interest are associated with the change of analysts’ GAI-related discussions in a similar manner as in the case of managers’ discussions. We use a similar approach to calculate the changes of analysts’ GAI-related discussions as well as discussions with different content features as in the case of managers’ discussions based on analysts’ questions during the Q&A session of a call. These changes are denoted as Analyst GAI%, Analyst GAI%-Positive, and so on. We then repeat the analyses in Tables 3-5 and report the results in Table 10. As analysts’ questions could be influenced by managers’ discussions in their presentations, we additionally control for the change of managers’ GAI-related discussions in the presentation section (ΔGAI%-Presentation). We find that financial analysts increase GAI-related questions more for firms with greater cybersecurity threats and labor exposure to AI, which have positive tones. For firms with greater customer operations, analysts increase GAI-related questions more, which have positive, negative, and neutral tones, and could be both initiatives-related and non-initiatives- related. These results are largely consistent with those of managers’ GAI-related discussions. However, analysts’ responses regarding GAI appear to be generally unrelated to innovation 15 The control variables include market value, book to market ratio, return volatility, absolute earnings surprises, absolute call sentiment, and return on assets. 29 intensity or product differentiation.16 Thus, analysts’ responses to the ChatGPT regarding GAI appear similar to managers’, except that they generally do not consider firms’ innovation intensity or product differentiation as an important factor. We next examine whether corporate managers’ assessment of GAI’s impact, as revealed in their GAI-related disclosures, is consistent with those of capital market investors. We use market reactions to the launch of ChatGPT to proxy for investors’ perception and examine whether managers of firms that experience a greater market reaction to the launch of ChatGPT, measured by the absolute value of three-day abnormal return (|GPT Launch CAR|), increase GAI-related discussions more in subsequent conference calls.17 The results are reported in Table 11. In Column (1), we do not include the five firm/industry characteristics of interest. We find that |GPT Launch CAR| is positively and significantly associated with ΔGAI%, with a coefficient of 0.083 and t-statistic of 1.75, suggesting that for firms whose investors perceive GAI to have a greater impact on the firm, managers also increase GAI-related discussions more, that is, managers also perceive a greater impact. In this sense, managers’ perceptions are consistent with investors’. In Column (2), we include the five firm/industry characteristics of interest, and find that the significance of the coefficient |GPT Launch CAR| is subsumed both economically and statistically, while the five firm/industry characteristics of interest all load positively and significantly. This evidence suggests the five firm/industry characteristics we examine capture part of the channels through which investors perceive GAI to affect a firm. 6 Conclusion We provide early evidence of GAI’s potential impact on corporations through managerial 16 Product Differentiation is still positively related to the change of analysts’ neutral-sentiment discussions related to GAI. 17 We favor unsigned return in this analysis because our dependent variable, ΔGAI%, does not consider the direction of the GAI’s impact. 30 discussions of GAI in conference calls after the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. We examine the corporate impact of GAI through its impact on five dimensions of corporate resources and capabilities—innovation, cybersecurity, product, labor, and customer operations. We find that following the release of ChatGPT, managerial discussions of GAI in conference calls increase substantially, and the increase is more pronounced for firms with greater innovation intensity, cybersecurity risk, product differentiation, labor exposure to AI, and customer operations, suggesting that these firms are more likely to be affected by GAI. Our analysis of discussion sentiment suggests that managers tend to believe that GAI is more beneficial to firms with greater innovation intensity and cybersecurity threats but is more detrimental to firms with greater product differentiation. While they hold mixed views on GAI’s impact on firms with greater labor exposure to AI and customer operations, they perspectives are more likely to be positive than negative. Our additional content analysis suggests that managers of firms with greater innovation intensity, cybersecurity threats and customer operations increase initiative-related discussions more. In contrast, managers of firms with greater product differentiation tend to increase non-initiative-related discussions more. While managers of firms with greater labor exposure to AI increase discussions of both types more, they are more likely to increase initiative-related ones. The five factors we examine also explain financial analysts’ GAI-related discussions in conference calls in a similar manner as for managers’ discussions, except that financial analysts’ responses generally do not vary with firms’ innovation intensity or product differentiation. In addition, managers’ responses to the release ChatGPT regarding the impact of GAI appear to be consistent with investors’ perceptions, and investors find managers’ GAI- related discussions in conference calls informative. Our study sheds light on GAI’s multi- faceted impact on corporations and heterogeneous corporate responses. 31 References Amir, E., S. Levi, and T. Livne. 2018.

Panel A presents examples based on the discussion topics that pertain to the five dimensions of GAI’s impact examined in this paper. Panel B presents examples based on the discussion sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). Panel C presents examples based on the discussion content (initiative vs. non-initiative). Panel A: Discussion Topic Topic Company Call Date Manager Discussion Innovation Dialogue Health Technologies Inc May 10, 2023 “There's a lot happening in AI, large language models and all sorts of technologies that are coming up. The way we think about it is patient-facing and nonpatient facing, right? So in nonpatient-facing opportunities, we're really taking advantage of ChatGPT and others. So for example, our developers are using ChatGPT to help with code the use that GBT to do unit tests on code and to find solutions and answers to some of their problems. So that's been used quite a bit. We had a internal hackathon a couple of weeks ago. A lot of the ideas were around ChatGPT.” Cybersecurity Palo Alto Networks, Inc March 7, 2023 “And what it does is it causes havoc in a company over here and everybody has to go upgrade the entire technical stack. So I don't think cybersecurity is going away. I think cybersecurity is going to be here to stay. I think there's a lot of technical debt we have not paid in the cybersecurity space. Cybersecurity -- cyber risk is now the #1 enterprise risk for companies, one that they can try and manage, excluding pandemics, et cetera. So it's a growth market. So in that market, with the huge technological change that is going on now with the advent of AI, the people are using AI right malware. We're testing in our labs. We're trying to figure out if we can write malware and go protect ourselves against malware written by ChatGPT. So try doing that, right?” Product Five9, Inc. February 22, 2023 “The second category is generative AI, such as ChatGPT. As you know, we have been leading the market with our AI and automation solutions, and we are now further strengthening our portfolio with the inclusion of GPT-3. We are pleased to announce 2 new product offerings that leverage GPT-3 from OpenAI.” Labor Coursera, Inc. March 9, 2023 “Now the big, what about, is generative AI. I've been absolutely obsessed with ChatGPT probably most of you have as well. My view is, this is a fundamental game changer. Like I don't even know what society is going to be like in 18, 36 months. When every major software platform builds that ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies into their software, it's going to show up before people even know what to do with it. So I don't know if generative AI is going to take a lot of these knowledge jobs and make them more vulnerable as well. But in any case, the rate of change driven by technology and globalization is creating major change in the way that people do jobs, the way that businesses run and the skills and the knowledge and the credentials that people need to effectively add value to these companies. So as Bain said, in 2022, this is more true now than ever. The big challenge for all of us is trying to figure out how to transition workers from declining occupation to jobs of the future, especially in a world where a job of the future that we thought like 6 months ago might be now declining occupation. I mean it is changing so fast, it's mind-blowing.” 37 Appendix C (Continued) Examples of Managers’ GAI-Related Discussions Customer SK Telecom Co.,Ltd February 8, 2023 “And moving on to ChatGPT, we already have the GPT-3 in A. service. So we have accumulated a large amount of customer data. So by using this data, we are advancing the ChatGPT-type technology. So there is fierce competition with big tech companies globally. So in order to ensure rapid upgrades and improvement of A., we are considering various options and solutions, including those from the overseas. And the direction of advancing our technology will be in line with the kinds of services that we want to offer to our customers. So the adoption of long-term memory technology and the multimodal technology are very much in line with this direction. In doing so, we will be able to offer differentiated services to our customers based on a differentiated conversation and AI technology.” Panel B: Discussion Sentiment Sentiment Company Call Date Manager Discussion Positive Software Aktiengesellschaft April 27, 2023 “Another great innovation and achievement is the integration of ChatGPT. In January, we became the first independent iPaaS platform provider to introduce a ChatGPT API connector enabling seamless interaction with this innovative language model. Innovation like this continues to increase the impact we can deliver for customers. For example, we recently secured an outstanding win with Lufthansa Technik. Our data integration solution web methods has enabled them to reduce manual processes on 45,000 transactions per day from 27% to 8%. This has helped not only lower costs and increase operational performance but also enhance the technological competitive advantage.” Negative Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd April 28, 2023 “You also ask how we are using ChatGPT. We have a digital team in the U.S., and we are using the same technology. However, I have heard that even with ChatGPT, there are some erroneous results. So I don't think we can trust the system fully, but I am aware of its use as 1 of the tools used at work.” Neutral Kakao Corp. February 9, 2023 “On top of reinforcing our core business, we are exploring new growth opportunities through our focus on AI and Healthcare. We see hyperscale AI model, including ChatGPT, which has recently been the buzz, will be both an opportunity and a threat to Kakao. I say this because services developed based on AI are not differentiated by innovative ideas, but by the size of the model which is determined by the amount of investment you put in. And because the quality is dictated by investment, global companies with their large sum of capital and technologies have an absolute upper hand in this battle.” Panel C: Discussion Content Type Company Call Date Manager Discussion Initiative Farfetch Limited May 18, 2023 “One of the areas we are most excited about is the recent developments that large language models are bringing to the field of AI. We're already in a leading position with respect to AI intellectual industry with significant in- house data science, AI, and machine learning teams, and we have been active in this space for many years now. Our long-standing partnership with Microsoft has opened up the opportunity to access the most advanced version of ChatGPT, and our tech teams have been developing several concrete applications of ChatGPT for the luxury space. I believe this could be a significant development for Farfetch.” Non- Initiative Nepa AB May 16, 2023 “We will always have a need, this really clever human touch on what we deliver. And even if ChatGPT is getting better and better by the day, yes. So far, my colleagues are clever, more clever than ChatGPT.” 38 Appendix D Variable Definitions Variable Definition Disclosure Variables ΔGAI% Change in GAI discussions in post-ChatGPT period relative to the pre- ChatGPT period, calculated as the managers’ GAI-related discussion as a percentage of GAI-related sentences relative to the managers’ total speeches in the conference call, subtract the average of the same measure based on the calls hosted between November 30, 2021 and November 29, 2022. We multiply it by 100 for the ease of interpretation. We identify GAI-related sentences following a two-step procedure. We first identify sentences containing keywords listed in Appendix B, we then manually read sentences centering around the keyword sentences to identify GAI contextual sentences. GAI-related sentences include both the keyword sentences and the contextual sentences. ΔGAI%-Positive Change in positive-toned GAI discussions, where GAI%-Positive equals GAI% if the net sentiment of GAI-related discussions is positive, and zero otherwise. The sentiment is quantified by the difference between the counts of positive and negative words, normalized by the total word count in the Loughran and McDonald dictionary. ΔGAI%-Negative Change in negative-toned GAI discussions, where GAI%-Negative equals GAI% if the net sentiment of GAI-related discussions is negative, and zero otherwise. The sentiment is quantified by the difference between the counts of positive and negative words, normalized by the total word count in the Loughran and McDonald dictionary. ΔGAI%-Neutral Change in neutral-toned GAI discussions, where GAI%- Neutral equals GAI% if the net sentiment of GAI-related discussions is neutral, and zero otherwise. The sentiment is quantified by the difference between the counts of positive and negative words, normalized by the total word count in the Loughran and McDonald dictionary. ΔGAI%-Initiative Change in initiative-related GAI discussions, where GAI%-Initiative equals GAI% if the GAI discussion contains GAI-related initiatives, and zero otherwise. We use GPT-4 to identify whether a corpus of text contains initiative of adopting GAI. Our prompt is as follow: Does the text involve real initiatives or plans in generative AI? Answer with 1 for 'Yes', 0 for 'No'. Text:[]. The seed for this prompt request is 88. ΔGAI%-NonInitiative Change in non-initiative-related GAI discussions, where GAI%- NonInitiative equals GAI% if the GAI discussion exists and does not contain GAI-related initiatives, and zero otherwise. We use GPT-4 to identify whether a corpus of text contains initiative of adopting GAI. Our prompt is as follow: Does the text involve real initiatives or plans in generative AI? Answer with 1 for 'Yes', 0 for 'No'. Text:[]. The seed for this prompt request is 88. 39 Appendix D (Continued) Variable Definitions Market Reaction Variables |GPT Launch CAR| Absolute market adjusted abnormal return cumulated around a three-day window centering on the ChatGPT launch date, November 30, 2022. We multiply it by 100 for the ease of interpretation. |Call CAR| Absolute three-day cumulative abnormal returns surrounding conference call. Abnormal returns are calculated based on market adjusted model. We multiply it by 100 for the ease of interpretation. Abnormal Trading Volume The three-day volume divided by shares outstanding, less the average three- day turnover in the estimation period. Following Bushee et al. (2011), we choose [-120, -30] as the estimation window. We multiply it by 100 for the ease of interpretation. Determinants Log Patents Logarithm of one plus the average number of patents filed over the past three calendar years. Cybersecurity Threats Textual similarity between 10-K cybersecurity risk related sentences and the disclosures of actual incidents of cyberattacks from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse’s Data Breach Chronology Database. Product Market Differentiation One minus the median product similarity score of focal firm with the top ten most similar firms. Product similarity data are based on Hoberg and Phillips (2016). AIIE AI industry exposure calculated based on occupation's exposure (Felten et al., 2021). Customer Operations Indicator variable equaling 1 if the firm is in the retail or service industries. We classify retail industry by 2-digit SIC codes 52-59, and service industry by 2-digit SIC codes 72, 73, and 78. Control Variables Analyst Coverage Logarithm of one plus the number of analysts who issue EPS forecasts for the firm over the past year. Institutional Shareholding Percentage of shares outstanding owned by institutional investors. Abnormal Return Volatility Standard deviation of market adjusted return over the past year. Firm Size Logarithm of total assets. Book to Market Book value of equity divided by market value. Firm Age Number of years the firm showing up in Compustat. High Tech Industry Indicator variable equaling 1 if 2-digit sic codes belong to 28, 35, 36, 73, and 87, and 0 otherwise. Quarterly MV Logarithm of market value at the end of most recent fiscal quarter. Quarterly Book to Market Book value divided by market value at the end of most recent fiscal quarter. Quarterly Return Volatility Return volatility over the period of [-127, -2] days relative to the conference call date (i.e., day 0) (Mayew and Venkatachalam, 2012). Absolute Earnings Surprise Absolute value of the difference between EPS and consensus analyst forecasts (median) in the latest 90 days, scaled by the stock price at the end of most recent fiscal quarter. Absolute Call Sentiment Percentage of sentiment words (Loughran and McDonald, 2011) in the entire conference call transcript.
