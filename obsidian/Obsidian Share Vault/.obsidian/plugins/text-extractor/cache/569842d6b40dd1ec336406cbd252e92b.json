The MO combines these with demand forecasts to produce equilibrium prices and instructs firms on their dispatch. We incorporate the possibility that generating firms may rebid (or revise) their supply schedule prior to dispatch - an important feature of markets in many countries which has not previously been included in theoretical models. We show that a dominant firm can gain substantially by manipulating its bids, and take advantage of the opportunity to submit rebids. In the Australian National Energy Market (NEM) where settlement prices are an average of six dispatch prices, it can, for example, withhold capacity at lower prices for the first bid in a period, creating a price hike, and then add capacity at lower prices to ensure dispatch. Using data from the Australian NEM we provide the first empirical evidence consistent with the hypothesized theoretical behaviour in the observed data. JEL-Codes: Q410, D430, D230.

Do they exercise their market power by collusion, or by non-cooperative strategic bidding? To what extent do observed price hikes reﬂect strategic bidding behaviour of generators? Do late rebids exacerbate price hikes? A number of papers have addressed some of these issues both at the theoretical and the empirical level. One must bear in mind, however, that diﬀerent electricity markets operate in diﬀerent institutional settings. This makes it diﬃcult to make comparisons across markets and to oﬀer a ‘general’ theory. Nevertheless, prominent researches on electricity pricing in deregulated markets in the past two decade seem to have reached the consensus that oligopoly theories, together with analyses of the data suggest that electricity generators have been able to exploit their market power. However, the existing literature ignores the real-world feature that in many national or regional markets, generators can revise their bids and make strategic use of the opportunity to submit their rebids. For example, in Alberta and Ontario, Canada, generators are allowed to make rebids up to two hours before dispatch.1 In Texas, bids may be changed up until one hour prior to the operation hour.2 In the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), the more than 300 generators can rebid up to ﬁve minutes before dispatch.3 In this paper, we make speciﬁc references to the institutional setting of the NEM. Electricity-generating ﬁrms in the NEM are invited to submit, on date t − 1, their bids (i.e., their supply schedules) for each of the 48 half-hour intervals for date t. Using these bids, the Market Operator (MO) provides forecast of the equilibrium prices, called ‘pre-dispatch prices’ (for each of the 48 half-hourly trading intervals, and under several diﬀerent demand scenarios). Generators are allowed to revise their bids (supply schedules) up to 5 minutes before dispatch. Some interesting questions arise. Even if costs conditions do not change, will generators ﬁnd it optimal to rebid in the light of the pre- dispatch prices? Does the opportunity to rebid give generators an incentive to make misleading bids? 4 Electricity generating companies have been modelled as Cournot rivals, Borenstein et al. (2002), as one-shot oligopolists which adopt static Nash behavior and do not try to collude (as in Klem- perer and Meyer (1989)) and subject to capacity constraints (Green and Newbery (1992)). Using the Cournot model, Borenstein et al. found that 59 percent of the quadrupling in Californian wholesale electricity expenditure between 1998 and 2002 can be attributed to market power.5 1See Appendix E of Australian Energy Regulator (2015) for an international comparison of rules relating to rebids. 2Hortaçsu and Puller (2008),p.89 mentioned this feature of the Texan market, but they did n ot analyse how ﬁrms might strategically make use of the rebidding opportunity. 3The Australian set-up is similar to the bidding and re-bidding process in Ontario, Canada, and in New Zealand. In Ontario, a pre-dispatch schedule is published at 11:00 a.m. the day before dispatch. Suppliers are allowed to make re-bids up to 2 hours before dispatch. 4Chester (2006) mentioned a number of papers that argue that rebidding exposes the NEM to electricity- generating companies with signiﬁcant market power. Handika et al. (2014) studied price spikes in the Australian electricity market, but they did not address the issue of strategic behaviour. 5The Californian market is quite complex because there are two primary institutions, the Power Exchange (PX), and the Independent System Operator (ISO), which determine respectively the date-ahead market and the real-time electricity spot market. Firms could change their date-ahead positions by transacting in the spot 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 Sweeting (2007) also found signiﬁcant market power in the England and Wales wholesale elec- tricity market, known as the Pool, for the period 1995-2000. Complementing this analysis with an alternative approach, using data on generators’ bids and cost, he found that the two largest generators, National Power (NP) and PowerGen (PG), signiﬁcantly deviated from the static non- cooperative behavior, and concluded that ‘their behaviour was consistent with tacit collusion’ (p. 654).6 The literature on supply function equilibrium (SFEs) begins with the work of Klemperer and Meyer (1989) for an oligopoly facing a stochastic demand curve. Klemperer and Meyer (1989) study Nash equilibrium when ﬁrms’ strategies are ‘supply schedules’ and ﬁnd that there are many possible equilibria. The non-uniqueness of outcomes makes predictions problematic. Adapting SFE theory to the electricity spot market Green and Newbery (1992) 7 ﬁnd that there is a multiplicity of SFEs, but they arague that amongst these equilibria, the equilibrium that yields the maximum proﬁt for each ﬁrm is the focal point SFE. Using this focal point as a predic- tion of ﬁrms’ bids, Green and Newbery (1992) calibrate the model and calculate the potential deadweight loss for consumers. They ﬁnd that the results are ‘extremely disturbing’ (p. 946) in terms of welfare loss. The Klemperer and Meyer (1989) framework assumes that each ﬁrm knows everything about their rivals. However, Hortaçsu and Puller (2008) point out that in the Texas spot market, bid- ders are bound by (previously signed) bilateral agreements with their customers in the wholesale market, agreements that are unobserved by rivals. such obligations surely aﬀect their bids in the real-time spot market. These bilateral contracts, which account for a substantial fraction of the power supply, are private information. Thus, Hortaçsu and Puller (2008) argue that one should look for a Bayesian-Nash equilibrium characterization of the bidding game, using the formula- tion proposed by Wilson (1979), Wilson (2002). Using data on bidders’ marginal cost functions, they calculate an ex-post optimal supply schedule, which is an equilibrium bid function under the assumption that bid functions are additively separable in the private information possessed by bidders. Comparing he ex-post optimal bid schedules with the actual bids, they ﬁnd that large Texan ﬁrms actual bids are close to the proﬁt-maximising bids, but small Texan ﬁrms use excessively steep schedules, indicating deviation from proﬁt maximisation.8 The purpose of this paper is to explore the strategic implications of the opportunity to make rebids, and analyze the rebidding data of the NEM to understand the signiﬁcance of rebidding, given the institutional set up of the NEM. Section 2 outlines the working of the Australian wholesale electricity market. In Section 3, we review some major existing theoretical models on bidding in the electricity market, with emphasis on supply function equilibria under non-cooperation. In section 4, we turn to collusive behavior, and develop a model of collusive bidding, assuming ﬁrms oﬀer linear aﬃne supply schedules. We market. 6Sweeting (2007) notes that ‘a complication is that generators signed unobserved quantities of ﬁnancial con- tracts which hedged their exposure to pool prices’(p. 656). 7Green and Newbery (1992) add a capacity constraint for each ﬁrm, and reinterpreting the random variable in the K&M model as time (since electricity demand varies with time). 8Hortaçsu and Puller (2008) argue that perhaps it is too costly for small ﬁrms to calculate the optimal mark-up (p.106). 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 explore incentives for collusive ﬁrms to misreport their costs to the Market Operator, and also how they might signal their costs to each other. In section 5, we turn to the non-collusive case with a dominant generator and a fringe of com- petitive generators, and show how the dominant ﬁrm may gain by taking advantage of rebids. We provide a simple example showing that a dominant generator can gain substantially in a 30-minute trading interval by manipulating its bid, and taqking advantage of the opportunity to submit rebids. It can, for example, withhold capacity for the ﬁrst bid, creating price hike in the ﬁrst 5-minute dispatch intervale, and then bring back its capacity in the following rebid which applies to the ﬁve remaining 5-minute dispatch intervals. Finally, in Section 6, we present data from the NEM drawn from the tens of millions of rebids tendered to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) over the period 2015 to 2017, which is suggestive of the supply-curve behavior of Australian electricity generators. We show that the observed behavior is consistent with our theoretical framework, with rebidding occurring in a strategically proﬁtable manner across alternative generation methods and geographic locations. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst empirical evidence of strategic rebidding extracted from a population of electricity generation data anywhere in the world.9 2 The Australian National Electricity Market The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), which began operation in December 1998, is a gross pool market for electricity, involving generators, electricity retailers, and large consumers, called ‘scheduled loads’. Generators are required to make bids (i.e., to oﬀer a supply schedule) and scheduled loads can also make demand-side bids. Both can make rebids. As pointed out in a document issued by Australian Energy Market Operator (2017), p.2, the NEM is an ’energy-only market’ in the sense that generators are only compensated for the energy they supply to the central pool.10 The NEM encompasses ﬁve Australian states: Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The state markets are connected by interstate ‘imports’ and ‘exports’ via a limited number of interconnectors. Spot prices diﬀer across states, because of inter-regional transmission-capacity constraints which limit the scope for arbitrage. For example, Queensland is connected to other parts of the NEM only via two transmission lines to New South Wales, and only a single undersea interconnector links the Victorian and the Tasmanian electricity grids. This section gives an overview of the bidding rules, the determination of the spot price, and a brief account of the possibility of price manipulation.11 2.1 Rules on bidding and rebidding Generators submit supply bids (and rebids) to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), who determines for each 5-minute interval a price, called the ‘dispatch price’ (to be distinguished 9This paper does not review approaches to forecasting electricity prices. (See Weron, 2014, for a comprehensive review of the literature on forecasting electricity prices.) 10This is in contrast to an energy-and-capacity market (e.g. Western Australia, which does not belong to the NEM) where suppliers also receive payments for their presence. 11Note that we focus on the spot market. There are hedge contracts between generators and retailers, but an examination of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper. 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 from ‘pre-dispatch prices’ which are issued before the ﬁnal rebids come in). Dispatch is the process whereby the Market Operator determines which generators should operate to meet the ﬁve-minute expected demand for electricity. The dispatch price is the bid of the most expensive generator that needs to be called on in order to equate supply to demand. 12 Dispatch prices are not prices at which accounts are settled. Instead, generators are paid the ‘settlement price’ (also called ‘spot price’), which is calculated for each half-hourly interval. It is an average of the six ﬁve-minute dispatch prices during that interval. For example, if the dispatch prices for 9:05am, 9:10am, 9:15 am etc., are denoted by D1, D2, D3 etc., the settlement price for 9:30am is P = (D1 + D2 + D4 + D5 + D6)/6. This means that if a generator can manufacture a hike in the dispatch price of the last ﬁve-minute interval it will be able to increase the revenue for its previous dispatch outcomes within the 30 minute trading interval.13 In September 2017, the AEMC Australian Energy Market Commission (2017) issued a draft policy to change this rule to 5-minute settlement, with technical details in Australian Energy Market Operator (2017). As yet there are many technical diﬃculties to be resolved, and the earliest implementation of the change is likely to be 2021. In the prevailing NEM structure (since 1998) each electricity trading day t commences at 4:00am on that day and ends at 3:59am on the following day. For each electricity trading day, bids are due before 12:30pm on the day prior (but rebids are allowed up to ﬁve minutes before each 5- minute dispatch interval). The trading day is divided into 48 periods (each lasting 30 minutes). By 12:30pm on date t − 1, electricity generating companies must submit their bids for all 48 half-hourly periods of the trading date t. Each bid must specify up to 10 price bands and 10 corresponding quantities (capacity increments) that the ﬁrm commits to supply. The nominated prices can be anywhere between the ﬂoor price of −$1000 per MWh and the market price ceiling (MPC) imposed by regulation.14 Below is a stylised example of a bid. Negative prices reﬂect the costs which generators face in shutting oﬀ production at short notice.15   band 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 price ($per MWh) −999 −45 2 8 20 25 35 60 220 400 qty 0 50 0 0 60 40 0 0 0 0   This schedule shows the cumulative amounts the generator is willing to dispatch; up to 150 units if the dispatch price is $25 per MWh (or higher). After receiving the bids, the Market Operator uses an algorithm to determine how forecast demand (for each of the 48 half-hourly periods) can be satisﬁed in the least costly way. This algorithm generates an estimated price, called “pre-dispatch price,” for each of the 48 periods in date t, which we denote by P e t,τ for τ = 1, 2, .., 48. and a set of pre-dispatch bounds P +∆ t,τ and P −∆ t,τ for higher or lower demand outcomes (±200 MWh). Four-hour ahead and twelve- 12Dispatch prices (every ﬁve minutes) are available on the website of AEMO, which also provides half-hourly spot prices. 13Demand-side responses by electricity retailers and large customers include switching on fast-response genera- tors. The incentives to invest in short-duration demand response systems are limited because of the time-weighted 30 minute pricing. 14MPCs vary, but can be as high as $14, 000 per MWh. 15Coal-ﬁred generators have very long start-up and shut-down times. It is better for them to stay online and face low or negative market prices for a number of trading intervals. Some coal-ﬁred plants need a start-up time of three days or more (Australian Energy Market Commission, 2015, p. 16). 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 hour ahead forecasts of demand, spot price, and available capacity are made available to market participants. Generators use the information in pre-dispatch prices, and other up-dated informations (weather, repairs), to submit rebids. In submitting rebids, they are not allowed to change the 10 prices that they initially speciﬁed in their bids; their rebids are restricted to changes in the quantities to be made available at each price band.16 While oﬀers apply to a whole 30-minute trading interval, rebids can be made during the trading interval and these aﬀect the remaining 5-minute dispatch interval(s). Generators can shift the quantities oﬀered between the diﬀerent price bands in response to changing market conditions. All rebids must be accompanied by an explanation.17 Generators can submit rebids up to ﬁve minutes before the actual dispatch. A rebid that shifts capacity from a lower price band to a higher price band has the eﬀect of shifting the supply curve upwards, thus raising the price.18 Chester (2006, p. 364) gives the following illustrative example of re-bidding by a 600 MW gen- erating unit. The original bid is   band 1 2 3 4 5 price −20 25 55 90 120 qty 100 200 100 75 125   and the rebid is   band 1 2 3 4 5 price −20 25 55 90 120 qty 0 0 50 0 125   The third row entries have changed but the entries in the ﬁrst and second rows must remain unchanged. Diagrammatically, this means that the generating unit is allowed to re-draw its step-like supply schedule, keeping the height of each step unchanged, but the width of each step can shrink to zero, or can widen. Chester (2006, p. 365) reports that “at least 40% of re-bids are made within one and a half hours of dispatch and at least 50% of re-bids have moved the volume of generation capacity from the original bid price-band to another price-band”. For the year ending March 2001, in about 50% of cases, technical plant reasons were cited. Other reasons cited include ‘market conditions’, ‘portfolio adjustment’ and ‘ﬁnancial optimisation’ Chester (2006, p. 366).19 Whenever spot price exceeds $5000/M W h, the Australian Market Regulator (AMR) is required to publish a report 16A similar restriction holds in the England and Wales market (Wolak (2000)): generators cannot change the price bid for each increment for the entire day, but they can vary the amount they are willing to supply from that capacity increment on a half-hourly basis. 17The rules have been tightened (Australian Energy Market Commission, 2015, p. xi). Eﬀective from 1 July 2016, if a rebid is made during a 30-minute trading interval or less than 15 minutes before the commencement of the trading interval, the generator must make a contemporaneous record setting out the 1material conditions and circumstances’ giving rise to the rebid. The record must be made available to the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) upon request. In the Federal Court case ‘AER v. Stanwell’, Justice Dowsett dismissed AER’s application. He found that a trader’s subjective expectations could be part of the material conditions and circumstances upon which a rebid could be based. (Australian Energy Market Commission, 2015, p. 111). 18The frequency at which capacity was shifted to price bands above $300 per MWh was higher in Queensland than in other regions of the NEM; see Australian Energy Market Commission (2015, p. 83). Note that any price above $100 per MWh is considered abnormally high, see Hurn et al. (2016, p. 712). 19Clements et al. (2016) examined strategic bidding and rebidding in the Queensland region of the NEM. In particular, they presented agregative evidence suggestive of rebidding after the extreme price spike on 28 August 2013. 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 covering the circumstances relating to the price hike, including an assessment as to whether rebidding contributed to the event.20 There have been concerns that generators may deliberately delay their rebids to withhold information. More recent reports, prepared by ROAM Consulting and Oakley Greenwood for AEMC, suggest that since 2007, there has been an increasing trend for late rebids and some evidence of more rebids toward the end of the 30-minute trading intervals, particularly in Queensland and to some extent in South Australia21, and even more recently see Australian Energy Market Operator (2017). 2.2 Price manipulation in Queensland A study by ROAM Consulting (Australian Energy Market Commission, 2015, p. 80-87) found that the tendency to make late rebids (i.e. close to dispatch time) is greater in Queensland than in any other region of the NEM. Price spikes above $300 per MWh in Queensland during 2014 were found to be more frequent in the last 5-minute dispatch interval of the 30-minute trading interval (though this was not the case in 2007-2011). There was a positive correlation between price spikes and the number of late rebids moving capacity to high price bands. The likelihood of late rebids that move capacity into high price bands increases the incidence of binding transmission constraints and decreases in the spare capacity for interconnectors to import energy. Empirically, Hurn et al. (2016) credits extreme price events in Queensland to “strategic behavior on the part of the generators” (p. 711). While their paper does not oﬀer a formal theory of strategic bidding, it provides some explanation of how prices can be manipulated. In Queensland, the base-load generators are mainly coal-ﬁred. They have low marginal costs but high cost of starting up and cooling down. In contrast, higher marginal cost gas-ﬁred turbines are used mainly in peak periods. Hurn et al. (2016, p. 710) suggest that a base-load generator can inﬂuence the price by reducing to zero the width of lower steps of its supply schedule, i.e. by withholding capacity at the lowest price bands.22 This has the eﬀect of shifting its supply schedule upward, forcing the market operator to raise the dispatch price. Once this is done, the base-load generator can rebid all its available capacity in the next and subsequent 5-minute intervals at the ﬂoor price to ensure it will be instructed to dispatch more, knowing that it gets paid not the ﬂoor price but the half-hour settlement price (which has been jacked up by the increase in the ﬁve-minute dispatch prices). Since the generator was not shut down, it does not take much time to ramp up to meet the instruction to increase the dispatch, giving these generators a strategic advantage. Even in the case where the manufactured price hike lasts only ﬁve minutes, the base-load generating units still gain because the price hike is translated into a higher spot price for the half-hour interval. When price hikes are of suﬃciently short duration, peaking capacity 20For instance, on 1 June 2009, the spot market price in Tasmania reached $9159/M W h for the 30-minute trading interval ending at 10:00am, while the forecast spot price, announced 4 hours earlier, was $59/M W h. This price hike was due to Hydro Tasmanian shifting about 1000 MW of capacity from prices below $300/M W h to prices above $9000/M W h. The rebid was made about 90 minutes before dispatch. The reason given for the rebid was ‘portfolio optimization.’ 21Australian Energy Market Commission (2015), “Bidding in Good Faith. Final Rule Determination”, 10 December 2015, page (v) and pages 82-87. 22This can be done either by declaring that the capacity is no longer available, or by shifting that capacity to a very high price band, say more than $300 per MWh, as ROAM Consulting suggested (Australian Energy Market Commission, 2015, p. 83). 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 operators, such as gas-ﬁred turbines, cannot participate because the increase in the settlement price is not suﬃcient to cover their high marginal costs.) The empirical strategy employed by Hurn et al. (2016) relies on the intuition that isolated half- hour high price events are more likely to be due to strategic behavior than those which continue for an hour or more (that is two or more consecutive settlement periods). They use this classi- ﬁcation to determine whether there has been a change in the probability of observing abnormal price episodes after deregulation in July 2007. After July 2007, 44% of price episodes lasted for half an hour, while before July 2007, the corresponding number was 39%. The authors ﬁnd that there is a signiﬁcant increase in the probability of observing isolated half-hourly abnormal price episodes after the transition to the competitive market. 3 The theory of supply function equilibrium: non-collusive bid- ding The pioneering theory of supply function equilibria by Klemperer and Meyer (1989) considers the case where oligopolistic ﬁrms commit to supply to the market speciﬁc quantities at speciﬁc market prices.23 Each of these ﬁrms announces a supply schedule, taking as given the supply schedules oﬀered by other ﬁrms. Since there are just a few ﬁrms, these supply schedules are strategically chosen and do not correspond to marginal cost curves. Equilibrium price is where the market demand curve intersects the horizontal sum of the strategically chosen supply sched- ules. Klemperer and Meyer (1989) postulate that ﬁrms must announce their supply schedules before knowing the realization of a random variable that aﬀects the demand curve. Several subsequent authors ﬁnd that this theory is most suited to the study of deregulated markets for electricity (Bolle, 1992; Green and Newbery, 1992; Newbery, 1998) . 3.1 Supply function equilibrium with smooth supply schedules Each of the n ﬁrms (electricity generators) must submit a bid, which takes the form of a schedule qi(p). For each spot price p, the ﬁrm is committed to supply a corresponding quantity, denoted by qi(p). For simplicity, for the moment we assume that p is a real number that can take any value in [0, ∞), and assume that qi(p) is a smooth function.24 The quantity demanded depends on two variables, p and a, where p is the spot price, and a is a random term (or, in a diﬀerent interpretation of the model, a refers to time of the day, suitably re-ordered, so that Da > 0.)25 Q d = D(p, a) Assume that Dp < 0 and Da > 0. A simple speciﬁcation is D(a, p) = a − bp, i.e., the ‘ran- dom term’ a inﬂuences only the vertical intercept of the demand curve. We shall refer to any realization a as ‘the state of the world’, or simply ‘state’ a. 23In other words, they are neither Cournot players, which commit to quantities, nor Bertrand players, which commit to prices. 24An alternative formulation would be to require that q(p) be a step-like supply function (von der Fehr and Harbord, 1993). These authors show that with this formulation, in general there is no equilibrium in pure strategies. Repeated auctions are diﬃcult to solved when there is no pure strategy equilibrium. 25See Green and Newbery (1992), and Newbery (1998), footnote 12. 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 The ﬁrms must submit their supply schedules, and commit to them, before the ‘random variable’ a is realized. The market operator (MO) then determines, for each a, the equilibrium price p(a) that clears the market, i.e., p(a) is the implicit function determined by the market-clearing condition D(p, a) = n∑ i=1 qi(p) For a given realization of a, ﬁrms are required to supply the quantities qi(p(a)), and are paid the amount p(a) × qi(p(a)). Firm i’s realized proﬁt in ‘state’ a is then πi(a) = p(a) × qi(p(a)) − Ci [qi(p(a))] where Ci(.) is the total cost function. Suppose ﬁrm i knows the supply functions of all other ﬁrms j ̸= i. Then it knows that at any a, it faces the ‘residual demand function’26 Ri(p, a) ≡ D(p, a) − S−i(p) where S−i(p) is the aggregate quantity supplied by all other ﬁrms at the price p: S−i(p) ≡ ∑ j̸=i qj(p). Then, in ‘state’ a, ﬁrm i’s proﬁt given that it must produce to satisfy the residual demand is Πi(p, a) ≡ p × Ri(p, a) − Ci [Ri(p, a)] As Klemperer and Meyer pointed out, ﬁrm i’s optimal (i.e. best response) supply function can be solved by positing that it is as if the ﬁrm would choose a price p (corresponding to each a) to maximize the proﬁt Πi(p, a) for each realization of a. The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) is27 Ri(p, a) + p ∂Ri(p, a) ∂p − C′ i [Ri(p, a)] ∂Ri(p, a) ∂p = 0 (1) This equation determines the proﬁt-maximizing price for the ﬁrm at a given a. If Πi(p, a) is strictly concave in p, then the FOC determines a unique price p∗ i (a) ≡ f (a) that ﬁrm i would want to achieve for each value of a. At that price, the quantity supplied by i is q∗ i (a) ≡ Ri(p ∗ i (a), a) If the function p∗ i (a) ≡ f (a) is invertible,28 then we can solve for ﬁrm i’s optimal (i.e. best reply) supply function qi = Si(p) : qi = Si(p) = q∗ i (f −1(p)) 26Firm i’s “residual demand curve” shows, at any price p, the diﬀerence between industry demand and the sum of quantities that all other ﬁrms are willing to supply at that price. 27The second order condition is satisﬁed if Ri is concave in p and Ci(qi) is a convex function. 28Given that Da < 0 and C ′′ ≥ 0, a suﬃcient condition for the invertibility of f (.) is that Dpa = 0 identically, as this ensures that Πpa does not change sign. 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 EXAMPLE 1: Assume that ﬁrm i’s cost function is Ci(qi) = 1 2 γiq2 i Let the demand function be D(p, a) = a − bp and assume that the (aggregate) supply function of other ﬁrms is S−i(p) = βp, where β ≥ 0. Then the residual demand function facing ﬁrm i is Ri(p, a) = a − (b + β)p The FOC (1) gives [a − (b + β)p] − [p − γi (a − (b + β)p)] (b + β) = 0 This yields p∗ i (a) = a [1 + γi(b + β)] (b + β) [2 + γi(b + β)] and q∗ i (a) = a − (b + β)p∗ i (a) (2) The function p∗ i (a), also denoted by f (a), can be inverted to yield a = f −1(p) a = (b + β) [2 + γi(b + β)] 1 + γi(b + β) p∗ i (3) Then we obtain ﬁrm i’s optimal supply function by substituting for a in equation (2) qi = (b + β) [2 + γi(b + β)] 1 + γi(b + β) p − (b + β)p = (b + β)p 1 + γi(b + β) ≡ ωp In this example, using the assumption that the random variable a can take on any value in the half line [0, ∞), we have shown that, given that other ﬁrms’ supply functions (i.e., “strategies”) are linear in p, ﬁrm i’s “best response” is a linear supply function. If there are only two ﬁrms, and γ1 = γ2, we must have β = ω, and thus obtain a unique symmetric SFE in linear strategies: qi = 1 2 [ −b + √ b2 + 4b γ ] p, i = 1, 2 (4) As Klemperer and Meyer (1989) point out, this result does not rule out the possibilities that there exists SFEs in which ﬁrms bid non-linear supply functions for some range of p (see Klemperer and Meyer, p. 1260). 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 3.2 SFE when the random variable is bounded above Green and Newbery (1992) do not think that it is realistic to allow the variable a to take on arbitrarily large values. Assuming an upper bound on a (i.e. a ≤ amax) and constant marginal cost, Newbery (1998, p. 732) considers the two-ﬁrm case, and shows that SFE can be found by solving the following diﬀerential equation29 dq dp = q p − C′(q) + Dp. (5) Assuming Dp = −b < 0, and C′(q) = 0, Newbery (1998, p. 732) shows that in equilibrium the supply function of each ﬁrm takes the form q(p) = Ap − bp ln p, for 0 < p < amax 3b . where A is a constant of integration. It follows that there is a continuum of SFEs, each corre- sponding to a value of the constant of integration A.30 Newbery (1998) generalises the supply function equilibrium to the case of n identical ﬁrms with constant marginal cost, under linear demand with bounded vertical intercept. He shows that the more ﬁrms there are, the lower is the highest aggregate supply schedule.31 3.3 The step-like supply functions In the real world, each generating company typically operates several generating units (or ‘sets’) and oﬀers step-supply schedules. In an innovative paper, von der Fehr and Harbord (1993) argue that if sets are of signiﬁcant size, the results obtained under the assumption of smooth supply functions may not hold. Their alternative model suggests that ‘high-cost sets may be bid in at lower oﬀer prices than lower-cost sets’ (p. 532). Consider the model of von der Fehr and Harbord (1993), which belongs to the literature on multiple-unit auctions.32 There are N generating companies, indexed by g = 1, 2, ..., N. Assume that generating company g has mg generating units (or ‘sets’). Let kgs denote the capacity of the s-th set of generating company g. Deﬁne the capacity of the generating company g by kg = mg∑ s=1 kgs. The capacity of the industry is K = N∑ g=1 kg. 29See Appendix A for the derivation of this equation. 30Newbery shows that any value of A in the interval (0, b(1 − ln(3b/amax)] deﬁnes a pair of equilibrium supply schedule for some range of p. 31Another complication is capacity constraint. Klemperer and Mayer assume that ﬁrms do not face any capacity constraints. Green and Newbery (1992) add realism to the SFE approach by imposing capacity constraints. 32McAfee and McMillan (1987, p. 724-5) provide a brief review of this literature.Kastl (2011) oﬀers a more general treatment of the theory of discrete bids and discusses the empirical inference in this context. With discrete bids, a ﬁrm’s residual demand function is a step function. However, Hortaçsu and Puller (2008) found that in practice the calculations of ex-post proﬁtability under the \"unsmoothed\" residual demand do not diﬀer much from the ex-post proﬁtability under the the \"smoothed\" residual demand. 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 With perfectly inelastic demand, regardless of the price, the quantity demanded is d, which is a random variable with distribution G(d). Each generator g submits bid prices pgs for s = 1, 2, ..., mg. Assume that the bids are not allowed to be higher than an exogenous ceiling price p. The market operator ranks the bids to obtain a market supply curve. Upon the realization of the random variable d, the spot price is determined by equating demand and supply. All operating units that actually supply a positive output receive the same spot price.33 If two sets have the same bid prices, they are equally likely to be called into operation. von der Fehr and Harbord assume that each generating company g has constant marginal cost cg for all its sets. By convention, the companies are labelled so that cg+1 ≥ cg. They point out that typically ﬁrms will play mixed strategies in equilibrium, because a ﬁrm that oﬀers a ﬁxed bid is likely to be undercut by other ﬁrms: with a block supply, the gain from undercutting can be substantial. (This is in sharp contrast to the case where each set is ‘inﬁnitesimally small’). The authors derive the mixed strategy equilibrium for the case of duopoly with 0 = c1 ≤ c2 ≡ c, and for the case of n generating companies with identical costs.34 They ﬁnd that the expected spot price is decreasing in N . They conclude that “for a given number of generating sets in the industry, system marginal price will be a decreasing number of owners” (p. 537). The theoretical model of von der Fehr and Harbord (1993) is not meant to be tested directly. The authors ﬁnd that actual bidding behavior is consistent with the predictions of the model. 3.4 Discriminatory versus uniform auctions Wholesale electricity markets are typically organized as uniform, ﬁrst-price auctions. In March 2001 the UK introduced a discriminatory (pay-as-bid) auction format. Fabra et al. (2006, p. 23) report,‘The British regulatory authority (Ofgem) believed that uniform auctions are more subject to strategic manipulation by large traders than are discriminatory auctions.’ However, they also point out (p. 24) that there are no consensus on the superiority of one form of auction over the other.35 The two forms of auctions are compared in Fabra et al. (2006), but their main analysis is based on the special assumption that the ﬁrms observe the realization of demand before they submit their bids. (This assumption may be suitable for markets in which the price oﬀers (bids) are short-lived, such as in Spain; it is not suitable for markets in which price oﬀers must remain ﬁxed for the whole day, e.g., in Australia.)36 33As pointed out by the authors, in the UK, in most half-hour periods (called Table A periods), each dispatched generating set (genset) is paid, in addition to the system marginal price, a capacity element which reﬂects the probability of loss of load (a power shortage). 34See their working paper version, 1992. 35Second-price auctions, ﬁrst practised by the poet Goethe in 1797 (see Moldovanu and Tietzel (1998)) are common on the internet (e.g. ebay auctions), but have not been used for electricity bidding. 36Fabra et al. (2006) also brieﬂy consider the case of ‘long-lived bids’ in which suppliers face time-varying demand, see p. 34-36. They are only able to characterize the mixed-strategy equilibria in the case each supplier has only one generating set, i.e., the step function has only one step. 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 4 Collusive bidding by heterogeneous oligopolists Let us turn to a simple model of collusive behavior. Assume that the industry consists of only two ﬁrms, denoted by i = 1, 2.37 Their outputs are denoted by q1 and q2 respectively. Their combined output is Q = q1 + q2. Assume that the ﬁrm i’s true marginal cost is αi + βiqi, and its total cost is Ci(qi) = αiqi + βi 2 (qi) 2 The demand function is D(P ) = { A−P B if P ≤ A 0 if P > A . from which we obtain the demand curve P (Q) P (Q) = A − BQ We assume that the price intercept of the demand curve is higher than the intercept of the marginal cost schedules, A>max (α1,α2). 4.1 The benchmark scenario Assume for the moment that the ﬁrms have perfect knowledge of the parameters A and B. If they collude, they will behave such that the industry marginal revenue equals the industry’s marginal cost. For any desired industry output level Q, the collusive ﬁrms will choose q1 and q2 to minimize the production cost subject to q1 + q2 = Q. The cost-minimizing outputs for the collusive ﬁrms are q1 = ( β2 β1 + β2 ) Q + ( α2 − α1 β1 + β2 ) ≡ q1(Q) (6) q2 = ( β1 β1 + β2 ) Q + ( α1 − α2 β1 + β2 ) ≡ q2(Q) (7) For the collusive ﬁrms, their total cost of supplying the aggregate quantity is C(Q) = α1q1(Q) + β1 2 (q1(Q)) 2 + α2q2(Q) + β2 2 (q2(Q)) 2 The collusive ﬁrms equate marginal revenue with marginal cost to determine their collusive aggregate output: Q∗ = A (β1 + β2) − (α1β2 + α2β1) β1β2 + 2B (β1 + β2) The optimal outputs of the ﬁrms are are38 q1 = ( β2 β1 + β2 ) ( A (β1 + β2) − (α1β2 + α2β1) β1β2 + 2B (β1 + β2) ) + ( α2 − α1 β1 + β2 ) and q2 = ( β1 β1 + β2 ) ( A (β1 + β2) − (α1β2 + α2β1) β1β2 + 2B (β1 + β2) ) + ( α1 − α2 β1 + β2 ) 37Extension to the case of n heterogeneous ﬁrms is straightforward. 38We assume that max {α1 − α2, α2 − α1} is small enough so that ﬁrms’ outputs are positive. 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 4.2 Achieving the collusive output by coordinating supply functions Now, suppose that the collusive ﬁrms cannot directly set quantities nor price. Instead, they have to ‘bid’ by providing to the Market Operator their ‘supply functions’, and the latter will determine the price that equates demand to supply. What are the ‘supply functions’ that will achieve the highest proﬁt for the collusive ﬁrms? Can the ﬁrms achieve the monopoly proﬁt by bidding linear ‘supply functions’ ? Suppose the ﬁrms are required to oﬀer supply functions (bids) qi(P ) = P − ai bi The Market Operator then construct the aggregate supply scheduleS(P)=q1(P)+q2(P), and for a given realization of A, the ﬁrms’ supply schedules must be such that a1, a2, b1 and b2 satisfy the conditions b1 = β1 + (β1 + β2)B β2 (8) b2 = β2 + (β1 + β2)B β1 (9) a1 = α1 + (α1 − α2)B β2 (10) and a2 = α2 + (α2 − α1)B β1 (11) Suppose β1 = β2 = β. Then their supply functions will have the slope b1 = b2 = β + 2B (12) , i.e., both ﬁrms exaggerate the slope of their marginal cost curves. And the intercepts will be a1 = α1 + (α1 − α2)B/β (13) a2 = α2 + (α2 − α1)B/β (14) Thus the ﬁrm with the higher (lower) intercept will overstate (understate) its intercept. 4.3 Sending signals In the preceding section, we assume that ﬁrms know each other’s true marginal costs. Suppose that each ﬁrm i knows its αi and βi at the beginning of each day, but they cannot directly communicate this information to the other ﬁrm (perhaps because of anti-trust legislations). Then one way of communication would be to submit to the Market Operator (MO) the numbers (ai, bi). The MO will then construct the supply curve, and announce the forecasted dispatch price, P M O F .(Here the subscript F indicates that the price is only a forecast price, subject to 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 change that the MO will make upon receiving the revised bids.) Upon receiving P M O F , ﬁrms will make some inferences about the true costs of the other ﬁrm. (We have to model a ‘reasonable’ inference process.) They will then revise their bids, with the objective of maximizing their joint proﬁts. Consider the simplest case, where the only random cost parameter is α1 (i.e., the other three parameters, α2, β1 and β2 are not random). Suppose that α1 is either high (= αH 1 ) or low (= αL 1 ). Suppose the ﬁrms are allowed to revise their bids only once. When ﬁrms make their ﬁrst round bids, ﬁrm 1 already knows the realization of α1, but ﬁrm 2 does not. The latter supposes that α1 = αH 1 with probability p and α1 = αL 1 with probability 1 − p. Let us suppose that the ﬁrm 2 makes its ﬁrst round bid as if α1 = pαH 1 + (1 − p)αL 1 ≡ Eα1. Then its ’reported’ ﬁrst-round linear supply function is q2(P ) = P − a2 b2 where, a2 = α2 + (α2 − Eα1)B/β and b2 = β + 2B Suppose that ﬁrm 1’s ﬁrst-round bid uses a similar rule, i.e., b1 = β + 2B and, when the realized value of α1 is αH 1 , its reported value is a H 1 = αH 1 + (αH 1 − α2)B/β while if α1 = αL 1 , then a L 1 = αH 1 + (αH 1 − α2)B/β If aH 1 is reported, the market operator will calculate that the aggregate supply schedule, and announce the dispatch price that would equate demand and supply. Now comes round 2. At this stage, ﬁrm 2, having observed A, and having received the price sent by the market operator, can infer (with certainty) whether ﬁrm 1 has reported aL 1 or aH 1 . The round 2 bids will reﬂect the ﬁrms’ perfect knowledge about α1. 5 Strategic bid and rebid by a dominant ﬁrm In the preceding section, the focus was on collusive behavior of suppliers that are similar. In this section, we turn to the case of an industry consisting of a large dominant ﬁrm and a competitive fringe. We show that the dominant ﬁrm has a strong incentive to submit bids and rebids strategically in order to generate a price hike over a short time interval (say, half an hour). The dominant ﬁrm can manufacture a price hike either toward the end of the 30 minute trading interval, or at the beginning of it. Let us illustrate both possibilities. 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 5.1 Manufacturing a price hike in the ﬁrst dispatch interval Let us consider a simple numerical example. Assume that the electricity demand for each 5- minute interval is Q = 120 MW. There is a base-load generator (which we call the ‘dominant ﬁrm’) that has two generating sets with capacity of 42MW and 38MW respectively. Their corresponding marginal costs are $0 per MWh and $5 per MWh. There are a large number of higher cost generators (which we call the ‘fringe’) that can collectively supply the ﬁrst 40 units of capacity at the marginal cost of $15per MWh, a further 10 units of capacity with a marginal cost of $30 per MWh, and another 10 units of capacity at a marginal cost of $80 per MWh. Any further increase in output from the fringe would involve a marginal cost of $1000 per MWh.39 Assume that if the dispatch price in the ﬁrst ﬁve-minute interval turns out to be abnormally high, there will be some lagged demand-side response in the forms of self-supply: for example, retailers can switch on their own gas-ﬁred turbines. We assume that such demand-side responses will take time: 10 units of capacity can be brought online for second ﬁve-minute interval, and 20 units at the third and each subsequent ﬁve-minute interval. Suppose for the moment that all ﬁrms are truthful and bid according to their marginal costs. Then a truthful bid of the dominant generator will be, for example,   band 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 price −999 0 5 15 30 80 100 500 800 1000 qty 0 42 38 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   and the fringe’s bid will be   band 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 price −999 0 5 15 30 80 100 500 800 1000 qty 0 0 0 40 20 10 0 0 0 10   To satisfy the demand of 120 MW, the MO will instruct to dominant ﬁrm to dispatch 80 MW, and the fringe ﬁrms to dispatch 40 MW for each of the ﬁve-minute intervals. Since 5 minutes amounts to 1/12 of an hour, over the ﬁve minutes, the energy outputs they produce are respectively 80 × (1/12) MWh and 40 × (1/12) MWh. The dispatch price is $15 per MWh. It reﬂects the marginal cost of the fringe ﬁrms. For each 5-minute interval the dominant ﬁrm will earn a proﬁt of (15 − 0) × 42 × (1/12) + (15 − 5) × 38 × (1/12) = $84. 167 Its proﬁt for the 30 minute trading interval is $505 Now consider a possible strategic move by the dominant ﬁrm. Just ﬁve minutes prior to the trading interval, it sumbits a rebid that oﬀers to supply the 38 units of capacity from the second generating set only at the ceiling price of $14, 000 per MWH, indicating that it would supply only 42 units of capacity from the ﬁrst generating set if the price is positive but below $14, 000 per Mwh:   band 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 price −999 0 5 15 30 80 100 500 800 1000 qty 0 42 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   39Bid prices in the vicinity of $14, 000 per MWh have been observed in Queensland, though the average price is below $80 per MWh. See e.g. Hurn et al. (2016). 16 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 Then, to satisfy the demand of 120 MW, the MO must set the dispatch price D1 = $1000 for the ﬁrst 5-minute interval. We assume that this very high dispatch price triggers a demand- side response: the output from gas peaking generators owned by retailers will become available. Suppose 10 units of capacity will be available for second ﬁve-minute interval, and 20 units of capacity for the third and each subsequent ﬁve-minute interval. Consequently, the MO operator must satisfy a net demand of 110 MW in the second 5-minute interval, and a net demand of 100 MW in each of the subsequent 5-minute intervals. The dispatch prices for these ﬁve-minutes intervals will be D2 = $80 (since 110 units are dispatched, consisting of 42 units from the dominant generator and 68 units from the fringe), and D3 = D4 = D5 = D6 = $30 (since 100 units are dispatched, consisting of 40 units from the dominant generator and 60 units from the fringe). The ‘settlement price’ is the time-weighted average of the dispatch prices P = (D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 + D5 + D6)/6 = (1000 + 80 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30)/6 = $200 per MWh At this settlement price, the proﬁt of the dominant ﬁrm per ﬁve minute interval is 200 × 42 × (1/12) = $700 Its proﬁt for the 30 minute trading interval is 700 × 6 = $4, 200 This is much greater than the proﬁt of $505 that the ﬁrm would earn with an honest bid. Thus, it pays to withhold capacity from the second generating set for the whole 30 minute trading period. However, we will show below that the dominant ﬁrm can do even better by rebidding (after the dispatch price peak of $1, 000), oﬀering the 38 MW capacity from the second generating set for the second and subsequent 5-minute intervals at the low price of $5 per MWh. Eﬀective from the second 5-minute interval,   band 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 price −999 0 5 15 30 80 100 500 800 1000 qty 0 42 38 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   In the second 5-minute interval, the Market Operator must satisfy a net demand of 110 units (recall that, as a demand-side response, in the second 5-minute interval, the retailers can bring online 10 units of capacity, and 20 MW capacity will be available during each subsequent 5- minute interval). To satisfy this net demand, the MO will ask the dominant ﬁrm to dispatch 80 units and the fringe to dispatch 30 units. Since the fringe’s marginal cost is $15 per MWh, the dispatch price for the second 5-minute interval is $15 per MWh. In the third 5-minute interval, the Market Operator must satisfy a net demand of 100 units. This is done by asking the dominant ﬁrm to dispatch 80 units and the fringe to dispatch 20 17 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 units. Again the dispatch price is $15 per MWh. The settlement price is P = (D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 + D5 + D6)/6 = (1000 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15)/6 = $179.17 per MWh The proﬁt of the dominant ﬁrm in the ﬁrst 5-minute interval is 179.17 × 42 × (1/12) = $627. 10 and its proﬁt in each of the ﬁve subsequent 5-minute intervals is 179.17 × 42 × (1/12) + (179.17 − 5) × 38 × (1/12) = $1, 178. 60 Its total proﬁt for the 30 minute trading interval is 627. 10 + 5 × (1178. 60) = $6, 520. 10 This is much greater than the proﬁt of $4, 200 that it would obtain if it did not rebid (i.e. if it continued to withhold 38 units of capacity for the last ﬁve 5-minute intervals). 5.2 Manufacturing a price hike in the last dispatch interval In the preceding subsection, we assumed that a ﬁrm can withhold capacity for the ﬁrst 5-minute dispatch interval to increase the ﬁrst 5-minute dispatch price (and consequently the settlement price for the half-hour trading interval), and subsequently rebid the capacity for the second 5- minute interval. In some cases, such behavior can be risky: the regulator may have have grounds to prosecute the ﬁrm. It may be safer to withhold capacity in the sixth 5-minute dispatch interval rather than in the ﬁrst 5-minute dispatch interval. This will increase the dispatch price for the sixth 5-minute dispatch interval, and consequently raising the settlement price for the ﬁrm’s ﬁve earlier dispatches. If the ﬁrm’s competitors could anticipate the settlement price hike, they would increase their capacity oﬀers, and it would not be worthwhile for the ﬁrm to withhold capacity. It is crucial, therefore, that the ﬁrm’s withholding of capacity for the sixth 5-minute interval be made public as late as possible, so that the ‘surprise price hike’ gives the competitors little time to react. 6 Rebidding in the Australian Electricity Market For a number of years the market operator has reported little evidence of rebidding activity. For example Australian Energy Market Commission (2015) engaged ROAM Consulting to under- take a quantitative analysis of rebidding in the NEM. ROAM’s key ﬁndings for 2007-2014 were reported on page 80 of AEMC Australian Energy Market Commission (2015) with four rele- vant conclusions. First they found little evidence of a systematic tendency for rebidding toward the end of trading intervals or in rebidding just prior to dispatch, with the exception of recent episodes in Queensland and to some extent in South Australia. Second, a strong statistically 18 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 signiﬁcant relationship exists between the probability of price spikes and late rebidding in QLD in 2014 and SA in 2013. In QLD and SA the rebidding generally shifted capacity to high price bands, and in 2013 and 2014 QLD markets showed evidence of generation withholding capacity to high price bands towards the end of the trading intervals. The evidence used to support the lack of systematic rebidding presented in Figure 8.2 of the Australian Energy Market Operator (2017) report strongly suggests that further investigation is necessary. First, the data provided take no account of potential diurnality or seasonality eﬀects. By collating all ’last 5-minute dispatch’ rebids for every settlement period into a single representation over a year, the graph masks time-of-day, day-of-week and seasonal patterns. Similarly, by aggregating the rebids across all generators the data masks the strategic behavior taken at both generator and potentially portfolio level, given that there are fewer electricity generating ﬁrms than generators. In their 2017 reports the Australian Energy Market Operator (2017) and Australian Energy Market Commission (2017) provide evidence that the price spikes that are expected to occur as a result of the bidding and settlement structure outlined in this paper are present, see particularly the text from page 29 onwards in Australian Energy Market Commission (2017). These data provide evidence on the non-random nature of price spikes, and their excess occurrence in the ﬁrst ﬁve-minutes of the settlement period. 40 AEMC, however, have not yet provided evidence concerning the behavior of individual generators, or the extent of capacity being moved between price bands to achieve these outcomes. AEMO provide extensive public data on rebidding on their website. Unfortunately, it is neither particularly transparent nor easy to use or manipulate.41 Drawing on the datasets available from AEMO we have isolated the rebidding behaviour of each generator in the NEM for the period 01/09/2015 to 31/03/2017 to obtain a picture of the diﬀering activities available. It is fair to say that the variety of strategies employed is remarkable, no doubt contributing to the diﬃculties in pinning down these behaviours at an industry level. However, it is also true that evidence of strategic behaviour in the form of rebidding occurs across all States and forms of power generation. For some generators the evidence occurs only rarely, sometimes associated with periods of market stress. In other generators the behaviour is evident for sustained periods of time and occurs multiple times in the same day. We isolate rebidding from the dataset by ﬁnding changes in the quantity oﬀered at the price bands in eﬀect for each generator on that day. To simplify the problem slightly we concentrate only on rebids which occur for dispatch on the same day as the rebid (because of the structure of the bidding it is possible to rebid for a dispatch period on a diﬀerent date). This leaves us with the possibility of rebidding for 48 possible dispatch periods in each day. The rebids can occur at any time of day, and we speciﬁcally focus on those which change the volume for immediate dispatch periods up to the end of the following settlement period (that is from the point of rebid until the end of the next 30 minute settlement period). The structure of the rebidding 40From July 2016 a stricter criteria against late-rebidding, within 15 minutes of dispatch, tended to push price spikes even more towards the ﬁrst 5-minute period. 41The issues are somewhat parallel to the diﬃculties encountered in the transparency of high frequency ﬁnancial market data in the 1990s, see Brandt and Kavajecz (2004). 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 system is such that when a generator rebids, it rebids the volume for all half-hour periods of that day. That is, if we imagine the day as running from t = 0, ..., 48, then regardless of when the rebid occurs, there may be volume changes recorded for all t, regardless of whether that period is in the past or not. This creates some particular diﬃculties in constructing the dataset, as clearly bids cannot be revised post-dispatch. This quirk of the dataset contributes greatly to the diﬃculty in assessing strategic changes in the supply schedule as past schedules need to be carefully constructed from an evolving dataset. A convenient means of illustrating a rebid for a single point in time for a single generator is given in Figure 1. The top right hand panel represents the rebidding activity of a particular generator at 8:06:55 on May 24, 2016 (thus the heading for each panel is read as yyyymmddhhmmss). Along the right hand horizontal axis are the price bands ordered from lowest to highest. The left hand horizontal axis gives the dispatch period to which the supply bids apply. The vertical axis gives the quantity (in MW) of the change in volume oﬀered by the generator in each of the bands pertaining to each dispatch period compared with the previously oﬀered supply curve. That is, the charts show how the generator is realigning its volume up and down the supply curve at various points. Where the surface is ﬂat there is no change in the supply of volume in that price band for this rebid. Valleys (or dips below zero) indicate volume is being removed from that price band, and hills (above zero) indicate volume being added to that price band. Note that in the vast majority of cases generators oﬀer all their supply capacity at some price on the curve, and hence valleys and hills will generally net to zero as the volume is simply being shifted along the supply curve at each point in time. It is important to note that this three dimensional representation consists of a stack of supply curves which refer to individual points in time. As post-generation electricty is not currently storable in any meaningful way power is not being transferred from one dispatch period to the next by the actions of the generator. The ﬁrst point to note about the rebid given in the top left of Figure 1 is that it occurs at 8:06:55am. Consequently, all of the pre-8:06 changes in volume oﬀered are irrelevant. That is most of the periods at the very front of the ﬁgure where volume is taken from the highest price band and moved to the lowest price band are simply irrelevant. The other dominant feature on the ﬁgure is the move of volume from a previously very low price band to the highest price bands - indicated by the red arrow. This rebid is taking volume from its previously lowest possible price band to the highest possible price band. In particular, this includes contributing to a steeper aggregate supply curve for the afternoon peak period from around 3pm - 5pm. The ﬁgure in the right hand top panel of Figure 1 shows the same generator rebidding again (its next rebid) later in the day at 15:13:03. It is apparent that now for the dispatch periods after 3:13pm volume is removed from the highest price bands to the lowest price bands. That is, compared with the original ’in good faith’ bid by this generator volume was moved from the lowest to higher price bands at one point in the day, and then immediately prior to dispatch moved back from highest to lower price bands. Note that in the second rebid the same generator also moves volume for later in the evening from previously placed low price bands back to high price bands - perhaps in anticipation of the potential for later strategic plays. Because this generator is only one of a portfolio owned by the power generating company the strategic game is likely to be far more complex than the illustration from a single generator here as ﬁrms optimise across their suite of 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 available generators. A second example of rebidding behaviour is given in the lower panels of Figure 1. The lower left panel shows a bid on May 26, 2016 at 09:13:45am when volume is moved from the lowest to highest price bands as shown by the red arrow. A few minutes later, at 09:20:56am volume is moved back from the highest price band to the lowest for a subset of the original rebid. While the individual generator stories are fascinating AEMO received between 6 and 8 million rebids annually between 2010 and 2015, making analysis of individual rebids infeasible. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for rebids for eight sample generators across the period September 2015 to March 2017 by generator type and location; it includes generators of varying sizes from diﬀerent States involved in NEM across a range of power generation types - coal, gas, hydro and wind including at least one representative of the dominant capacity production types (black and brown coal, gas, hydro, wind). The generators do not all look the same (and it is worth noting that the price bands for each are not necessarily the same either across generator or across time). However, it is clear that each of the coal ﬁred stations (GSTONE1, GSTONE6, LYA1) bid most of their volume in lowest price bands, bands 1 and 2, (recall that this is not the price they receive, it merely indicates that the costs of not dispatching are very high for coal ﬁred stations). The fact that the highest median is in band 2, rather than band 1, reﬂects that band 1 is often placed at the allowed price ﬂoor of $1000 per MWh, and reveals the skewness in the volume data. Coal ﬁred stations also manage to allocate rather more to the highest price band on average than to bands 3 to 9. And price band 10 has a relatively high standard deviation, which is unsurprising given that it incorporates the highest allowable price of $14,000 per MWh. The two gas generators look quite diﬀerent, AGLHAL has median volume concentrated at the top band and band 7, with a mean distribution which however reﬂects more volume dispatched towards the lower price bands. The diﬀerence between the mean and median volumes is prima facie evidence that there are some curiosities about the behaviour of these markets. PPCCGT, on the other hand, is primarily bidding volume in its lowest and highest price bands, reﬂected in both the mean and median results. The standard deviations are also highest in these bands. The two hydro stations are also quite diﬀerent. Bastyan is a small generator and provides volume mainly at high price bands, while Tarraleah is a larger generator and tends to provide volume at its lowest price bands. Notably, however, the next highest standard deviations of these volumes are found in the higher price bands. As discussed the diurnality and seasonality of rebids is a potentially diﬃcult detail. Sun Metals (Sun Metals (2015a)) provided details of six particular instances when price spikes resulted from generators withholding volume. They claimed a lack of evidence of rebidding in the ﬁrst 15 minutes of 30 minute dispatches and a preponderance of occurrences in the last 5 and 10 minutes. To provide some more background to this problem we provide a sample of the diurnal pattern of rebidding for GSTONE1 generator and AGLHAL in Figure 2 compiled by cumulating the number of rebids by 5-minute time interval over the day during the sample period. Prima facie there seems to be evidence of diurnal patterns, both within the day, where there is clearly more rebidding activity in and around the peak demand periods for power in the morning prior to 8am and early evening. Additionally there are potentially hourly and/or half-hourly patterns 21 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 consistent with the rebidding patterns proposed for the proﬁt maximising ﬁrm by the theoretical framework. To provide preliminary evidence that this is indeed the case we ﬁt a sinusoidal curve of the form xt = A.sin(ω ∗ t + ϕ) to each of the rebid counts of the form given in Figure 2 where xt represents the number of rebids in the 5-minute interval. The results where no-breaks are allowed within the day are remarkably consistent across diﬀerent generators, giving statistically signiﬁcant estimates of a cycle with a period of just over 15 minutes in each case.42 This is consistent with the idea that the generators may rebid more in the 10 minutes after the hour, and 10 minutes before the end of the half-hour than at other times. When we break the day into several sub-periods, from 4:00am to 10:000am (early morning), from 10:00am to 3:00am (peak work) and from 3:00pm to 10:00 (evening) we see that although the periodicity does not vary signiﬁcantly, the amplitude of the cycle (that is the extent of rebidding) is substantially and signiﬁcantly higher in the peak activity periods. These results are indicative that there is diurnality in the rebidding activity. Overall, the results support the claims by Sun Metals that there is more bidding in the late part of the half-hour dispatch period, but not clearly that there is none in the early part. However, the Sun Metals claim related speciﬁcally to rebidding related to price spikes. The relationship to price spikes by by generator and time of day is complex, and beyond the scope of this paper (it will be addressed in future research). In an attempt to deal with some of the perceived strategic bidding behaviour, a ’late-bidding’ rule was introduced to the market eﬀective from July 1, 2016, midway through our sample period; AEMC (2015). This rule established that when a generator created a rebid during the last half of the relevant 30 minute dispatch period they could be required to provide detailed records of the reasons behind those bids, thus putting the onus of proving ’good faith’ onto the generator. To demonstrate its eﬀect we divide our sample period in halves, pre-July 2016 and post-July 2016. Figure 3 presents the proportion of bids which occur in the last 15 minutes of the half-hour intervals by a number of generators. It is clear that for the vast majority (Bastyan is the only exception) the proportion of rebidding activity meeting the late re-bidding category has dropped discernibly after the introduction of the rule. Our estimate here may be biased downwards, as the announcement of the new late rebidding requirements occurred in December 2015, and the market was aware that AEMC was examining this issue from at least mid-2015 when Sun Metals made submissions concerning this issue to both the AEMC and the Queensland Government (Sun Metals (2015b),Sun Metals (2015a)). It may also be notable that the absolute number of rebidding events has also dropped considerably for these generators across the two sample periods - although it is diﬃcult to distinguish how much of this is due to changing underlying conditions or to the increased awareness of rebidding activity by regulators and analysts. Finally, we provide evidence that the rebidding is not uniformly distributed across the price bands. In particular, for the eight generators shown in Table 1 we consider the extent to which rebidding events result in the removal of volume from/to the top two price bands to 42The period is given by 2π/ω. The individual estimations are not presented in order to conserve space, and because while the cycle estimated is signiﬁcant, the ﬁt is poor and little is gained from the detailed results. A more sophisticated econometric approach is required to estimate the form of the diurnality properly, and is underway in future research. The preliminary results are available from the authors on request. 22 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 the lowest two price bands and vice versa. This is the most likely evidence of volume changes for strategic reasons consistent with the modelling framework presented in this paper, as it represents substantial changes in volume available at either end of the supply curve, either for a strategic reason or as a result of extremely poor forecasting. Given the proﬁtability of electricity generation in Australia in recent years the former seems a more likely explanation. Table 2 gives three rows for each generator. These divide the total number of megawatts oﬀered by the generator in their rebid actions and the volume which is shifted. The ﬁrst row for each generator captures the vast majority of all rebid activity, where there is no change in the volume bid in that price band - consistent with the ﬂat areas in Figure 1. In all cases over 85 percent of the generating volume oﬀered does not change price band during the rebid. The second and third row indicate how much generation capacity is moved from one end of the supply curve to the other in the rebids. It is clear, from simply adding up all the shifted capacity in these three categories that there is almost no rebidding which lies out side these groups - all of the totals add up to 98 percent or greater of rebids. This means there are disproportionately large shifts in volume occurring between the lowest and highest price bands, consistent with strategic bidding activity. The wind generator, HALLWF2 shows least evidence of this, which is consistent with wind being a non-synchronised, non-baseload generation source. The largest proportions of capacity oﬀered shifting between the two tails occur for the coal stations in Queensland, consistent with the literature presented in Section 2.2 outlining the evidence for price manipulation in that State. 7 Conclusion Electricity generation supply systems around the globe have attempted to solve the problem of determining competitive prices for power when faced with oligopolistic suppliers. Theoreti- cal frameworks have been developed to capture the salient features of these markets, but one potentially important feature has thus far been neglected. Many of the existing systems allow for electricity generators to rebid their original oﬀers to supply in the lead-up to the actual dispatch. While pragmatically this has been an acceptable solution to the problem of relatively infrequent observations on electricity demand, it has previously been unclear to what extent it may facilitate strategic supply curve behaviour on the behalf of the generators. This paper has developed a theoretical framework to incorporate rebidding behaviour into our understanding of the provision of supply by electricity generators and its potential to inﬂuence price volatility and levels at wholesale level. Both higher wholesale prices and volatility are passed to retail consumers in the form of higher prices. Using data for the Australian NEM we have for the ﬁrst time, to our knowledge, provided evidence of strategic behaviour across the supply curve by individual generators which shows the potential of supply curve strategies which impact prices in precisely the way predicted by our theoretical model. Only recently has empirical evidence on this behaviour begun to emerge, at least partly due to the complexity of the datasets and a need to utilise big data techniques to control for diurnality, seasonality and other non-annual patterns in extracting the summary statistics to describe the observed outcomes. Future work will aim to quantify the extent to which portfolios of generators could result in more nuanced strategic behaviours than revealed here via individual generators. However, the fact that we can detect 23 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 strategic supply curve behaviour in individual generators, across alternative power generating sources and geographic locations in the NEM provides ample support of the incentives created by the market design to create proﬁtable opportunities. The problems inherent in this market draw attention to the importance of market design and implementation when trading oﬀ the pragmatic need for technical solutions detailed in Australian Energy Market Operator (2017) with the incentives faced by ﬁrms generating ﬁnancial proﬁts. 24 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 References Australian Energy Market Commission. 2015.

The cost of producing qi is Ci(qi), a convex function, with C′ i ≥ 0. Assume ﬁrm j’s supply function is Si(p). Then ﬁrm i’s residual demand function is Ri(p, a) = D(p, a) − Sj(p) Firm i’s equilibrium output in state a must satisfy the residual demand, i.e.. qi(a) = D(p, a) − Sj(p) Firm i’s proﬁt function in state a is Πi(p, a) ≡ p × Ri(p, a) − Ci [Ri(p, a)] In state a, given the rival’s supply function Sj(p), ﬁrm i would like to choose a p that maximizes its proﬁt. The FOC for ﬁrm i is Ri(p, a) + p ∂Ri(p, a) ∂p − C′ i [Ri(p, a)] ∂Ri(p, a) ∂p = 0 This eq can be re-written as D(p, a) − Sj(p) = − [ p − C′ i(qi) ] [ ∂D(p, a) ∂p − S′ j(p)] (A.1) Using the market clearing condition qi = D(p, a) − Sj(p), ﬁrm i’s optimality condition (A.1) becomes qi [p − C′ i(qi)] = S′ j(p) − ∂D(p, a) ∂p (A.2) Similarly, given ﬁrm i’s supply function Si(p), ﬁrm j’s optimality condition is qj[ p − C′ j(qj) ] = S′ i(p) − ∂D(p, a) ∂p (A.3) Solving the pair of diﬀerential equations (A.2) and (A.3), one obtain a SFE. Consider the case where both ﬁrms have the same cost function. Then we seek a symmetric SFE where both ﬁrms bid identical supply functions q = q(p). We thus face only a single diﬀerential equation dq dp = q p − C′(q) + Dp (A.4) If C′(q) = γq, γ > 0, and Dp = −b < 0, this equation can be solved analytically, yielding a unique SFE, provided that we insists that all p ∈ [0, ∞) are possible; see Klemperer and Mayer, p. 1260. Remark: In the main text, we showed that if ﬁrm j’s supply function in Sj(p) = βp, then ﬁrm ´ı’s best response is qi(p) = (b + β) 1 + γi(b + β) p ≡ ωp 33 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673 If the two ﬁrms have identical cost functions, i.e. γi = γj = γ > 0, then in a symmetric equilibrium, we must have ω = β. Thus we can solve for ω from (b + ω) 1 + γ(b + ω) = ω (γ ̸= 0) Then43 ω2 + bω − (b/γ) = 0. Choosing the positive root (because we require an upward-sloping supply function), we obtain ω = 1 2 [ −b + √ b2 + 4b γ ] which is the same as in Klemperer and Meyer (1989, p. 1261). 43If γ = 0, then above equation has no solution for b ̸= 0. 34 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3126673","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
