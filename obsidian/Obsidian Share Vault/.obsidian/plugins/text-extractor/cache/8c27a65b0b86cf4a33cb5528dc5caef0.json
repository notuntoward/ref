Abstract This paper uses detailed, transaction-level data on candidate disbursements and panel survey data to estimate the eﬀect of candidate spending. Transaction-level data al- lows me to isolate only spending that is being used on messages to voters, while panel survey data enables me to control for unobserved candidate characteristics. I ﬁnd that spending on messages to voters has a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect on voter support for candidates. Spending is especially eﬀective in changing the composition of voters, instead of convincing potential voters to switch their vote. Not all voters are equally aﬀected by spending; low-information voters, members of a political party and the economically dissatisﬁed respond strongly to candidate spending. Finally, I provide evidence that the most commonly-used measure of candidate spending overestimates the amount of money that candidates use on their own campaigns, and regressions using this measure are less likely to ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of spending.

Despite the large space that campaign spending occupies in the public debate on American politics, there are still large gaps in our understanding of how (or even if) spending helps can- didates achieve their goals. “Virtually everything we have learned by examining the eﬀects of campaign-speciﬁc variables on election results tells us that, in one way or another, campaigns do matter. What remains in question is how campaigns matter” (Jacobson, 2006). A large body of literature has explored the eﬀects of candidate spending, but little consensus has been reached on the causal eﬀect of money on election outcomes (Milyo, 1999). Likewise, there has been no discernible pattern in the behavior of lawmakers with regard to campaign contribution laws. Over the past 30 years, numerous states (Nevada, Ohio, Tennessee) have introduced caps on contribu- tions to candidates in state elections, while others (Florida, Maryland, Wyoming) have raised the cap, and still others (California, Missouri) have ﬁrst imposed and later eliminated caps. This paper aims to advance our understanding of how campaigns matter in three ways. First, by using repeated surveys of voters both before and after elections, and pairing it with detailed candidate transaction data, I am able to estimate the eﬀect of candidate spending on messages to voters with relatively weak identifying assumptions. Second, since my outcome variable consists of voter-level data (instead of district-level vote shares), I can dissagregate the causal eﬀect across diﬀerent types of voters. Finally, I show that the most frequently-used method of measuring candidate spending overstates the amount of money that is being spent to increase a candidate’s vote share or odds of victory, and the magnitude of this diﬀers systematically across candidates based on election competition and incumbency status. Incumbents and candidates with a low probability of losing spend a larger fraction of their total disbursements on things that cannot feasibly help them win an election, such as contributions to other candidates, loan repayments, and donation refunds. Therefore, even unbiased estimates of candidate spending can diﬀer across electorates and candidates. There is likely no single “true” eﬀect of candidate spending, but data limitations have made it impossible to systematically evaluate diﬀerent types of candidate spending and estimate their eﬀect on diﬀerent types of potential voters. By utilizing detailed, transaction-level candidate disbursement data and new questions asked in the 2012 American National Election Study (ANES), I am able to link changes in voter prefer- 3 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

This framework improves on studies that rely on cross-election variation, and allows me to test theories of which voters are persuaded by candidate messages. I ﬁnd that candidate spending on advertising and campaign events has a positive, statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect on voter support. Spending changes the composition of those who vote (turnout), but does not lead to voters switching from one party to another in large numbers. Campaign spending appears to primarily aﬀect low-information voters, those who identiﬁed with a political party, and people who are unhappy with the state of the economy. Finally, I ﬁnd that when total aggregate spending (the most common measure used in the lit- erature) is used to create my measure of spending, I fail to ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect, suggesting a possible solution for the empirical puzzle of ineﬀective candidate spending. When studies ﬁnd candidate spending to have little eﬀect, it could be due to the fact that candidate spending measurements often include millions of dollars of useless spending (at least in terms of increasing a candidate’s vote share), which could drive the resulting point estimates towards zero, or increase the noise of those estimates. Motivation Although empirical research has frequently addressed the impact of campaign spending, little consensus has been reached. While some studies (Goldstien and Freedman, 2000; Gerber 1998) have found large eﬀects of campaign spending on candidate success, others (Levitt, 1994; Welch 1994) have found small or insigniﬁcant eﬀects. The importance of understanding the role of money in elections relates directly to determining optimal campaign ﬁnance policy. In order to anticipate the impact of any change in campaign ﬁnance laws, we must ﬁrst understand the extent to which candidates are able to use money to achieve their election goals. Numerous papers have attempted to resolve the issue of apparently ineﬀective campaign spend- ing. Stratmann (2009) shows that when advertising prices are accounted for, the estimated eﬀect of candidate spending increases (especially for incumbents). Gerber (2004) ﬁnds that the eﬀec- tiveness of spending changes with the competitiveness of elections (which is also found by Green and Krasno (1988)), and argues that candidates use spending to increase the likelihood of being 4 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

Erikson and Palfrey (2000) show that a simultaneity problem exists since both candidates will increase their spending if they expect an election to be close. Despite these insights, the empirical literature has failed to reach a consensus on the magnitude of the eﬀect of candidate spending. In this paper, I highlight several important factors that severely complicate attempts to de- termine causal eﬀects. First, not all candidate spending is used on a candidate’s own campaign. A candidate may increase their spending by purchasing ad time or by refunding a contribution. Both appear as disbursements, but only ad spending could impact a candidate’s success. There are systematic diﬀerences across candidates in how they spend money, especially based on their incumbency status and the competitiveness of their election. Unfortunately, detailed spending data has only recently become easily available for U.S. elections,1 meaning that most estimates in the literature cannot disentangle a dollar of ad spending from a dollar of refunds, or any other type of spending that is not being used directly on a campaign. Second, the composition of the electorate will inﬂuence the eﬀect of candidate spending. Not all voters change their preferences, and many people’s voting behavior will not be inﬂuenced by candidate messages. The eﬀect of candidate spending will be greater in districts where more voters can be persuaded by candidate messages to enter or leave an election or switch their party allegiance. Unfortunately, most studies have been forced to use a candidate’s vote share as the dependent variable, and cannot determine which speciﬁc potential voters are being inﬂuenced by spending. By using individual-level panel data on potential voters, I can measure changes in individual voter preferences. Therefore, my estimates rely on weaker identifying assumptions than do papers using cross-election variation in candidate spending and voting behavior. Few previous studies have used individual-level variation. Jacobson (1990) uses a panel survey data taken during the 1986 elections measures the eﬀect of candidate spending on changes in voter preferences during the last weeks of the campaign, ﬁnding that challenger spending has a larger eﬀect on voter prefer- ences. The author’s ﬁndings are limited by the use of aggregate measures of candidate spending, 1While transaction reports have long been publicly available, researchers wishing to use the full population of transactions needed to digitize hundreds of thousands items for every election cycle. 5 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

Goldstein and Freedman (2000) combine data on advertising exposure with the 1996 ANES, and ﬁnd that candidate spending on advertising is largely eﬀective. However, the authors use cross-sectional variation in voting behavior, and therefore cannot control for time-invariant unobserved characteristics. Another contribution is achieved by pairing individual changes in voter preferences with de- tailed changes in the pattern of candidate spending. Jacobson (2006) identiﬁed the need for more detailed data, stating “It would also be useful to get as detailed as possible a breakdown on the timing of campaign spending...the more fully we can measure campaign spending the better.” To my knowledge, only one paper, Ansolabehere and Gerber (1994), has speciﬁcally addressed the issues that might arise from using aggregate spending data as a measure of candidate spending. Using a fully itemized dataset of 1990 Congressional election candidates, the authors compare estimates of causal eﬀect under three diﬀerent measures of campaign spending. The authors consider all spending (which they call “disbursements”), only spending that will likely be used directly on the candidate’s own campaign (“spending”), and ﬁnally “communications”, which is advertising, direct voter contact, phone banks, and campaign rallies. However, the authors cannot control for unobserved candidate characteristics, which highlights the fact that a precise measure of campaign spending does not resolve the underlying endogeneity issues plaguing estimates of causal eﬀect. To this end, this paper compliments the existing literature that focuses on directed campaign messages. Unlike studies on the eﬀect of campaign spending, these studies have consistently found candidate messaging to be eﬀective in improving candidate outcomes (Spenkuch and Toni- atti (2018); Kendall et al. (2015); Da Silveria et al. (2011)). By focusing on the type of candidate spending, this paper provides one way to reconcile the lack of consensus on the eﬀect of candidate spending with the results of the eﬀect of candidate messaging. This work also builds on papers that have explored the role of campaigns on voter mobilization and demobilization, as I ﬁnd that candidate spending is eﬀective in discouraging potential voters for voting for opposing candidates. Since voting in the United States is voluntary, the impact of mobilization has been extensively studied, particularly with regards to negative advertising (An- 6 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

(1999); Kahn and Kinney (1999)). This paper expands this work by broadening the focus to campaign spending, while individual survey data allows me to identify which voters are most inﬂuenced by politicians’ campaigns. Candidate Spending Data One of the central goals of this paper is to better understand diﬀerent types of candidate spend- ing, and to isolate only those that are most likely to be used to sway voter. Candidate spending data comes from the Federal Election Commission candidate disbursement dataset, which details each individual transaction in support of a candidate of the 2012 Congressional elections.2 In support of the 2012 election, House of Representatives candidates spent almost $1.0966 billion consisting of 533,715 disbursements. This measure only includes candidates’ own committees, and therefore does not include spending by political action committees and independent committees. By focusing on only spending by candidates, I obtain a measure of spending that is clearly deﬁned (committee spending may be used to simultaneously support numerous candidates or causes) and also avoid a signiﬁcant potential threat to my identiﬁcation strategy, as I will discuss later. [Insert Figure 1 here] FEC ﬁling rules separate disbursement into 12 categories.3 Only 223,106 (41.8%) of disburse- ments, constituting $0.475 billion (43.3%) of spending have this ﬁling code explicitly provided. However, 530,853 (99.5%) of disbursements, constituting $1.089 billion (99.3%) of spending have a description detailing the type of spending, allowing me to assign spending codes to observations for the vast majority of disbursements. To assign spending to the correct codes, I used the following procedure. First, I assigned codes to observations where the attached description was identical to one of the 12 codes (i.e. “Donation”, “Advertisement”), were phrases that contained those words,4 similar variants (such 2So called “memo line” transactions were dropped from the data, as these disbursements represent double- payments (i.e. credit card payments, where the original purchase had already been itemized). 3The categories are: 1: Administrative/Salary/Overhead Expenses; 2: Travel; 3: Fundraising; 4: Advertising; 5: Polling Expenses; 6: Campaign Materials; 7: Campaign Events; 8: Transfers to other committees of same candidate; 9: Loan Repayments; 10: Refund of Contributions; 11: Political Contributions; 12: Donations. 4This included abbreviations (“ads”, “contr.”, “trvl.”), and other variations. 7 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

Finally, I determined, for all identical descriptions in the data, the most frequent disbursement code to which it was assigned. This code was assigned for any remaining missing values with the same description. Figure 1 shows the distribution of spending across these categories for incumbents, challengers, and candidates for open seats. [Insert Figure 2 here] Figure 2 shows the distribution of spending for all elections that were rated as “Tossups”, “Lean D” or“ Lean R” by the Cook Political Report. The largest change is the increase in advertisement spending, especially for incumbents, who spend 3 times as much on advertising when they are in competitive elections compared to those in noncompetitive ones. When candidates are most in need of convincing voters, they increasingly turn to spending on messages to the electorate. This insight builds on the work of Erikson and Palfrey (2000), who show that challengers and incumbents increase their total spending when the election is expected to be close. Detailed disbursement data shows that politicians also change the nature of their spending when they expect a tight race, and suggests that aggregate measures of candidate spending miss important variation across elections. To my knowledge, all studies of candidate spending in U.S. elections, with the exception of Ansolabehere and Gerber (1994), have used candidate spending aggregates as the measure of candidate spending.5 This measure includes all disbursements by candidates, regardless of the timing or type of spending. By relying on candidate summaries, previous research implicitly assumes that all candidate disbursements, regardless of the nature or timing, are being used to help a candidate win an election. [Insert Figure 3 here] Figure 3a illustrates a drawback to that assumption. It shows the spending throughout the election cycle of candidates who ultimately won in the 2012 House of Representatives general election, grouped by contested and uncontested candidates. 6 Candidates who faced no contest in 5This measure excludes any disbursements that are labeled as transfers to other committees. 6Candidates are considered to be uncontested if they face either no challenger in the general election or chal- lengers who failed to earn 5% of the vote share. 8 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

If the only purpose of all campaign spending were to persuade voters, it is diﬃcult to conceive of circumstances under which those who have no need to sway voters spend the greatest amount of money doing so. In- stead, safe incumbents are likely to maintain large staﬀs and begin building war chests to prepare for future political battles, raise funds for their party, and donate to candidates and committees. Throughout this paper, I focus on spending by candidates in the form of messages to voters, and therefore use advertising and events (categories 4 and 7) as the main measure of candidate spending.7 Of all candidate disbursements, about 30% consists of advertising or events.8 The motivation for this decision is grounded in literature that models the relationship between can- didates and potential voters. Several models (Austen-Smith (1987); Baron (1994)) describe the function of candidate spending as a way of informing voters of candidates’ true policy position. In others (Coate, 2004), candidates use spending to inform voters about their quality. Throughout, messaging is the primary mechanism through which candidates persuade voters. Figure 3b shows the same comparison as Figure 3a, using only spending on advertising and campaign events. Though uncontested candidates have spent more on these activities than con- tested candidates before the beginning of the year, almost all of this spending occurs before the beginning of the general election. Once the general election starts, spending all but ceases for uncontested candidates, while contested candidates increase their rate of spending. It is spending on messages, and not aggregate spending, that appears to follow patterns we would expect if the goal of spending is to change voter opinion during the general election. Empirical Speciﬁcation The 2012 ANES surveyed potential voters twice: once in the weeks before the election, and once after the election. During the pre-election survey, respondents were asked for whom they 7It could be argued that materials also fall into this category, since this includes items like yard signs and bumper stickers. However, I do not include them in my measure, as materials is an ambiguous deﬁnition, and may include things such a oﬃce supplies. 8As examples of the disbursements that appear under the category of ads and events, the 5 most common descriptions for “event” disbursements are: Catering Expense, Event Catering, Event Supplies, Event Ticket, and Event Expense. The 5 most common advertising disbursement descriptions are: Advertisement, Advertising, Direct Mail, Media, and Media Buy. 9 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

Aside from 1996, the pre-election question had not previously been asked with regards to Congressional elections. The panel of individual data allows me to control for unobserved individual and district-speciﬁc eﬀects. Because pre-election voter opinion is only measured in the month before the election, I am therefore estimating the eﬀect of late-campaign election spending. Individual voter behavior on Election Day is described by the following linear model: N etV otesid = φXi + β(ln(RepublicanSpending) − ln(DemocraticSpending))d + δi + ζd + ϵid Where N etV otesid is the net votes of individual i in district d for the Republican candidate in a 2-candidate race. A vote for the Republican is +1, a vote for the Democrat is -1, and a vote for neither is 0. This is determined by a set of observed voter characteristics Xi; 9 unobserved, time-invariant individual and district characteristics, δi and ζd; and spending by candidates. The candidate spending variable is constructed as the diﬀerence in the log of spending by the Repub- lican and Democratic candidates. Candidate spending is determined by cumulative spending of candidates between the beginning of the general election campaign (as measured by the end of the primary election) and the date of the general election. Candidate quality, political climate and unobserved voter preferences are captured by δi and ζd, but are unobserved, and lead to a biased estimate. Popular candidates will be better able to raise (and therefore spend) money, and will also be preferred by more individuals. Pre-election voting intentions are modeled in an almost identical way: N etV otesidt = γt + φXi + β(ln(RepublicanSpending) − ln(DemocraticSpending))dt + δi + ζd + ϵidt Where the dependent variable is determined by the candidate for whom the individual states they intend to vote at time t. N etV otesidt is +1 if a potential voter intended to vote for the Republican candidate, -1 if they intended to vote for the Democratic candidate, and 0 if they did 9Age, marital status, and sex. 10 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

Since the pre-election survey was conducted over several weeks, I include time ﬁxed eﬀects, γt which control for common, time-variant partisan shocks. By taking the diﬀerence between these two values, unobserved, time-invariant characteristics of elections and voters are fully captured: ∆N etV otesidt = ∆γt + β∆(ln(RepublicanSpending) − ln(DemocraticSpending))dt + ϵidt The dependent variable is the change in net votes for the Republican candidate. The variable is equal to +2 if the voter switches from Democrat to Republican, +1 if they switch from Demo- crat to no vote or from no vote to Republican, etc. By constructing the variable in this way, I can simultaneously capture movements along several margins (since a measure of -1 can denote Republican to “no vote” or “no vote” to Democrat, as they have the same impact on the vote share of a candidate). This allows for a natural comparison to research using vote share as the dependent variable, since the vote share for a candidate can be aﬀected by voters either switching their vote or by changing their decision on whether to vote at all. Since state-level elections are also occurring during this period, standard errors are clustered at the state level.11 As mentioned, for most of the estimates in this paper I limit my measures of spending to only those which are direct communications from politicians to potential voters (codes 4 and 7 in the FEC data). These types of spending are most suitable for the the speciﬁcation above for several reasons. First, candidates spend signiﬁcant amounts on advertising and campaign events in the weeks immediately before the election, as seen in Figure 3b. Second, since the measure of candidate spending is time sensitive, I want to focus on high-frequency spending, and eliminate 10The ANES survey asks “For whom does respondent intend to vote”, with a list of candidate names. 11The vector of observable, ﬁxed voter characteristics disappears from this speciﬁcation, since it is diﬀerenced out and fall into the error term. However, I can still include these variables in the regression to test whether they predict changes in voter behavior, which would indicate that the ﬁrst-diﬀerence regression is not appropriate. Therefore, I chose variables that are 1) Objective and easy to verify and 2) Correlated with partisan leanings in the cross-section of my data. 11 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

By observing changes in voter opinion within an election, the ﬁrst-diﬀerence speciﬁcation will capture any unobserved candidate quality that will otherwise bias the estimates. Additionally, the time dummy will allow me to control for common, partisan time shocks. Since 2012 was a Presidential election year, and Congressional and Presidential fates are correlated, shocks occur- ring to the Presidential election could aﬀect outcomes for all Congressional candidates. An alternative speciﬁcation to a linear model would be an ordered logit model. The dependent variable takes on values -2 to +2, and is monotonic in the sense that any 1-unit increase represents a change of 1 net votes for the Republican candidate. Therefore, interpreting the coeﬃcients for an ordered logit regression is relatively straightforward.12 The results from this regression are presented alongside those from the linear speciﬁcations, and show that the sign and signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings are robust to using this model. The primary identifying assumption of this framework is that election and individual-speciﬁc eﬀects remain time invariant during the general election campaign. Speciﬁcally, the assumption is that the unobserved factors that aﬀect both candidate spending and voter preferences are ﬁxed between the pre- and post-election surveys. This assumption would be violated if, for instance, candidate-speciﬁc, time-variant shocks occurred during the election cycle that aﬀected both the spending patterns of candidates, and the behavior of voters. Three characteristics of this framework help address these concerns. First, the pre-election survey occurred after most of the fundraising activity for the election had taken place. In 2012, only 7% percent of all fundraising spending occurred during the ﬁnal month of the campaign, and much of this was done by unchallenged incumbents. This means that even if, for example, a negative shock to candidate likability reduced the likelihood that a potential voter would vote for that candidate, the eﬀect it would have on candidate spending would be mitigated by the fact that most funds are acquired early in the election cycle. Second, the measure of spending used here captures only spending by candidates and ex- 12To perform this regression, the dependent variable is converted from a -2 to 2 scale into a 0 to 5 scale. 12 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

However, transfers from committees directly to candidates are common, and must be addressed. Though FEC data of transfers of funds into candidates’ campaigns from committees is not dis-aggregated to the day, I am able to isolate any transfers that occur after the 20th day prior to the general election, which compares favorably to the timing of the pre-election surveys. As shown in the Results section, my ﬁndings are robust to controlling for these late-campaign transfers. Finally, as there is variation in the timing of pre-election survey, I can use district ﬁxed ef- fects. This is an important control, as it addresses many lingering concerns about the speciﬁcation strategy. Though ﬁxed eﬀects reduce the precision of my estimates, the point estimates and most of the statistical signiﬁcance do not change when they are included. Since my measure of voter behavior is constructed using survey data, there are concerns of missmeasurement and response bias. Speciﬁcally, it has been noted that respondents may incor- rectly report to have voted for incumbents or election winners (Bloom, 1991; Atkenson, 1999). Incumbency bias would not pose a threat to my identiﬁcation strategy, since the identity of the incumbent does not change throughout the election cycle. Therefore, any incumbency bias would exist in the pre-election survey as well, and would be controlled for in the ﬁrst-diﬀerence regres- sion. A winner bias, however, could lead to biased estimates. If candidates who ultimately win the election also increase their spending late in the campaign cycle, and survey respondents erro- neously report to have voted for the winner after the election, the ﬁrst-diﬀerence regression would yield biased estimates. I test for this by regressing a winner dummy variable on changes in voter preferences, without controlling for candidate spending. The results, presented in the Appendix, fail to indicate that a winner bias plagues my results. Data Data on candidate spending comes from the FEC and is outlined in the Candidate Spending Data section. Unfortunately, spending data cannot be obtained for all candidates. Candidates spending less than $5,000 throughout the entire election cycle do not have to ﬁle detailed reports with the FEC. Any district with missing candidate spending data is dropped.

Data on potential voters come from the 2012 ANES Time Series Study, using questions re- garding candidates for the House of Representatives. Pre-election surveys took place between September 9 and November 5 (election day was November 6), with more than half taking place between October 16 and October 20. Despite the late timing of the pre-election surveys, a signiﬁ- cant percentage of respondents change their stated preferences between the pre and post-election survey. The most active margin is people who stated no preference (or who intended to abstain from voting) in pre-election survey shifting their vote to one of the candidates. More than 30% of these respondents ended up voting for one of the two candidates. Of the respondents who intended to vote for one of the candidates, about 25% changed their preference, but only about one-ﬁfth of this group did so by switching to the other candidate. Republicans are slightly less likely (22%) than Democrats (26%) to change their preference. Summary Statistics are shown in Table 1. Of the 435 Congressional districts, only 320 were used in my sample, as I dropped uncontested elections, elections where either only one candidate from a major party was participating, or two candidates from the same major party were par- ticipating in the General Election (which makes voter behavior impossible to determine through the ANES). Also, this sample only includes elections in which both candidates ﬁled disburse- ment reports. By election day, the average respondent was in a district where a candidate spend $599,589, with $186,283 occurring between the pre-election survey and election day. To focus on spending only of ads and events, candidates spent $298,202 by election day, $102,032 of which occurred after the pre-election survey. Candidates are therefore shifting their spending patterns towards ads and event spending as the election draws near. Before the pre-election survey, 47.5% of all spending is devoted to ads and events. After the pre-election survey, 54.8 % of all spending consists of ads and events. Compared to Figure 1, the candidates in my sample are spending more than the average race on ads and events. This is due to the exclusion of uncontested elections, where candidates are unlikely to spend much on ads. [Insert Table 1 here] 14 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

Individuals are only included in the dataset if they participated in both the pre and post- election survey, 13 and therefore there is the potential for non-response or attrition bias to aﬀect the sample (Peress, 2010). However, individual characteristics of my sample are representative of both the full ANES sample, and of eligible voters in general. Individual characteristics appear to be roughly representative of the voting-age population, with ratios of males and average age similar to the average reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. While the average age within my sample is slightly higher than the average age from the U.S. Census Bureau, this could be because both the ANES and Census only report broad age groups, instead of actual ages, which forces me to impute estimated ages for respondents. Of the 5,410 responders of the ANES for which demographic data is available, 3,139 are used for my analysis, and this group diﬀers slightly from the full ANES sample. They are more likely to be male and unmarried, and slightly younger, but these diﬀerences are not large.14 Finally, the net vote variable shows that the average voter will, on election day, cast net votes of -0.058 for the Republican, relative to the Democrat. This means that respondents are more likely to have voted for Democrats. The positive shift in net votes between pre and post-election surveys means that respondents shift towards Republican candidates. Of those who voted for either the Republican or Democrat, 54.2% voted for the Democrat. Though this diﬀerence is signiﬁcant compared to the preferences of all voters (where 50.6% of the two-party vote went to Democrats), this is mostly due to the elimination of uncontested elections, which were more likely to be won by Republican candidates. Results First, I consider the eﬀect of candidate spending on advertising and events, pooling all con- tested elections for which I have spending data. Table 2 presents these ﬁndings. Column 1 comes from a simple cross-section, using individual voting decisions on election day as the dependent 13I eliminate from all regressions anyone who had already voted before the pre-election survey. I also drop any extreme outliers, which are any observations for which the independent variable has a magnitude greater than 10, which occurs when a campaign has reported no or very little spending by the pre-election survey, but follows that with moderate or high amounts of spending in the weeks leading up to the election. This eliminates fewer than 20 observations. My main results do not change when these observations are included. 14The regression results are also robust to the inclusion of additional demographic covariates. 15 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

Unsurprisingly, a strong, positive correlation is observed between voter preferences and the spending of candidates. However, spending is endogenous to voter preferences. Unobserved candidate quality will likely increase both the funds they can raise (and therefore spend) and the likelihood than an individual will vote for them. [Insert Table 2 here] Columns 2-4 provide the results for various speciﬁcations of the ﬁrst-diﬀerence regression. In Columns 2 & 4, I include a set of dummies for when the pre-election survey occurred, and control for committee transfers to candidates. Column 3 includes a full set of time and district dummies,15 as well as the inclusion of demographic characteristics.16 Regardless of the speciﬁcation, I ﬁnd the eﬀect of spending on a candidate’s success to be positive and statistically signiﬁcant. Using Columns 2 & 3, I ﬁnd that a 1-unit change in the log of spending leads to a 0.0116 to 0.0202 increase in the net votes for a candidate, depending on the covariates selected. This means that a 10% increase in the spending for one candidate relative to the spending of the other, would increase in the net votes an individual casts for that candidate by 0.00116 to 0.00202. Consider an election with 500,000 voters, the average number of eligible voters in a Congressional district. A 0.00116 to 0.00202 change in the net votes for all voters would mean a change in the net votes of 580 to 1,010. A 580 unit change in net votes would occur if 580 potential voters entered an election to vote for a candidate or if 290 voters switching from the opponent to a candidate. Column 4 presents the results from an ordered logit regression, which indicates similar (though larger) causal eﬀect. To put these results in context, consider a $100,000 increase in spending on advertising and events for a Republican candidate. Using the estimates in Columns 2 & 3, this infusion would lead to a swing in the net vote of 0.0200 to 0.0349. In a 2-candidate races where everyone votes for one of the two candidates, this means that the candidate spending the extra $100,000 would see their 15This forces me to drop the committee transfer measure, as it does not vary within districts. 16By including observable characteristics, I am also providing a test for the validity of the ﬁrst-diﬀerence regres- sion. Since the identifying assumption of the ﬁrst-diﬀerence speciﬁcation is that by subtracting the two equations, I am fully capturing the eﬀect of time-invariant, unobserved characteristics, I certainly hope that it will also cap- ture the eﬀect of time-invariant observable characteristics. The results in Column 3 provide evidence that I have achieved this, as none of the coeﬃcients on voter characteristic variables are statistically signiﬁcant. 16 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

Table 3 shows the estimates of the eﬀect of all other spending categories. One of the primary claims of this paper is that only some categories of spending are used in support of a candi- dates own success; therefore, spending in several other categories should not be associated with an increase in voters’ opinions. The category-speciﬁc estimates support this claim. The most important results are those for categories of spending for which there can be no possible electoral beneﬁt, such as loan repayments, refunds, transfers, contributions and donations, because they provide a test of the validity of my identiﬁcation strategy. If voter opinion was changing due to some unobserved factor that also changed candidate spending on ads and events, instead of due to causal eﬀect of spending itself, this factor would also likely aﬀect candidate spending in these categories. The coeﬃcient on administrative expenditures, which constitute the largest portion of candi- date spending, is positive and somewhat large. Some campaign activity that is used to persuade voters (such as payroll for Get-Out-The-Vote staﬀers) may fall into this category. By focusing only on ads and events, my goal was to use categories that were most likely to have a majority of spending that was being used to persuade voters, not to capture all possible methods of voter persuasion. As I show in the Appendix, my main estimates of causal eﬀect are robust to the inclu- sion of additional categories of candidate spending, such as Administrative, Travel, or Materials. The direction and signiﬁcance of the results shown in Table 2 do not rely on my decision to not include these types of candidate spending. On the other hand, I also show in the Appendix how the inclusion of just 1 category which constitutes spending that is not used to persuade voters (Fundraising) leads to statistically insigniﬁcant estimates. [Insert Table 3 here] Finally, I estimate the eﬀect of candidate spending if I use all disbursements, regardless of 17Because my sample includes voters and non-voters, this eﬀect is larger when turnout is lower. If voter turnout were 70%, a 0.02 swing in net votes for every potential voter would lead to a 2.86% shift ( 0.02 0.70 ) in the vote share for a candidate, or an increase of 1.43% for that candidate with a 1.43% decrease for the other candidate. 17 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

This measure is most analogous to the measures that are most often used in the literature. The results are shown in the ﬁnal panel of Table 3.18 The point estimate increases, but so does the standard error, and I cannot reject the null hypoth- esis that spending has no eﬀect on voter opinion. This suggests that including all categories of candidate disbursement in the measure of candidate spending introduces noise to empirical esti- mates. The larger point estimate (compared to that in Table 2) further loses importance when I estimate the impact of a $100,000 increase in candidate spending, which is actually smaller than when I use the results from Table 2. This is because the independent variable now includes more disbursements, and a $100,000 increase therefore has a smaller impact on the independent variable. Erikson and Palfrey (2000) ﬁnd that incumbent spending in close elections has a much larger estimated marginal eﬀect than in safe elections. While the authors argue that the marginal eﬀect of close elections is the true unbaised estimate (while that for safe elections suﬀers from simul- taneity bias), Gerber (2004) argues that the marginal eﬀect of spending may change with the competitiveness of an election. These results oﬀer a mechanism for this argument: candidates (especially incumbents) spend much more on advertising, and less on disbursements that have no marginal eﬀect, when the election is expected to be close. Since this type of spending has a larger marginal eﬀect, the resulting point estimates will similarly be larger. Heterogeneous Eﬀects Individual-level data allows me to look at certain margins along which people can be aﬀected by candidate spending.19 Are the observed changes seen in Table 2 occurring because turnout is changing, people are switching their vote from one candidate to another, or a combination of the two? First, I look at people who in both the pre and post-election survey stated a preference for a candidate. The only possible variation in this group comes from party switchers. The results are shown in Column 1 of Table 4 (which I call the “Party” margin). The point estimate is 18Estimates for all speciﬁcations shown in Table 2 are in the Appendix. 19Unless stated otherwise, I use the speciﬁcation from Column 2 in Table 2, but the results are robust to the alternative speciﬁcations. 18 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

Column 2 shows the estimates when I only include people who either did not intend to vote for either the Republican or Democrat, or ultimately did not vote for either (the “Turnout” margin). The positive, signiﬁcant coeﬃcient indicates that candidate spending is particularly eﬀective in changing the composition of voters in their favor. Even though a single voter switching parties has a larger impact on the net votes for a candidate (from -1 to 1) than a voter leaving an election (a 1 unit swing), candidate spending has the greatest eﬀect along the turnout margin. [Insert Table 4 here] Column 3 shows that within the turnout margin, spending is most eﬀective in driving voters out of the election. By restricting the sample to people who did not vote, the only variation in the dependent variable is coming from people who initially intended to vote, but ultimately abstained. This margin is the most active one along which voters move in response to candidate spending on messages. These results are consistent with the demobilization hypothesis (Ansolabehere et al. (1994); Ansolabehere et al. (1999); Krupnikov (2011)), and also support the conclusions of Spenkuch and Toniatti (2018), who ﬁnd that advertising aﬀects election outcomes by changing the composition of the electorate. Given the rich set of questions asked as part of the ANES, it is also possible to test for het- erogeneous treatment eﬀects in order to identify characteristics of persuadable voters,20 and I ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences across diﬀerent types on voters in their responsiveness to candidate spending. Most of my ﬁndings ﬁnd their theoretical motivation in extensions of the Median Voter Theorem with voter abstention (Hirich and Ordershook (1969); Ledyard (1984); Adams and Meririll III (2003)) or with poorly-informed voters. In Barron’s model of electoral competition (Baron (1994)), candidates use costly campaign messages (which they pay for with contributions from special interest groups) to attract low-information voters, while high-information voters are unaﬀected. In equilibrium, candidates can refrain from converging to the median voter while using campaign spending to attract low-information voters. 20Persuadable voters are distinct from swing voters, who may change their minds for any reason, and may not respond to candidate spending. 19 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

Candidate persuasion can also play a role in models with voter abstention. When voters can decline to vote at all, candidates must weight the beneﬁt if moving towards the median voter against the cost of losing ideologically extreme voters to abstention. If candidates can use cam- paigns to sway voters, they may try to either appeal to ideological moderate or extremes on their side, or try to convince extreme voters of the opposing ideology to abstain from voting for their opponent. Therefore, whether ideologically moderate or extreme, partisan or independent potential voters are more aﬀected by candidate spending provide an important empirical test of the theoretical framework. First, I compare the causal eﬀects across individuals’ displayed level of information. Low- information voters may have less-developed opinions of the candidates, and therefore be more responsive the candidate persuasion, and numerous studies have found low-information voters to be more persuaded by candidate messaging (Valentino et al. (2004); Franz and Ridout (2007)). I measure voter information through six questions asked during the post-election survey. I assign each respondent a score based on how many questions they get correct, and divided that score by 6 to create an index that goes from 0 to 1. I then interacted that variable with the measure of candidate spending. Panel A of Table 5 reports the results of this regression. The large coeﬃcient on ∆Log(Spending) shows that low information voters (for whom the variable is equal to 0) are highly aﬀected by can- didate spending. The negative coeﬃcient on the interaction term indicates that high-information voters are signiﬁcantly less likely than their low-information counterparts to be aﬀected by can- didate spending. The similar magnitudes of the two coeﬃcients suggests that high-information voters (who have index scores of 1) are unaﬀected by spending. [Insert Table 5 here] Next, I consider a person’s political party aﬃliation by comparing the eﬀect of candidate spending on independents and non-independents. Party identiﬁcation is taken from the pre- election survey, so responses are not the result of swayed voters stating their party membership to be that of the candidate for whom they voted. The results, shown in Panel B of Table 5, 20 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019. Preprint (not copyedited or formatted). Please use DOI when citing or quoting. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1086/708646 This content downloaded from 128.151.010.035 on March 04, 2020 03:37:57 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). indicate that independent voters are less inﬂuenced by candidate spending than people who identify with a political party. The coeﬃcient on ∆Log(Spending) shows the estimated eﬀect on non-independents, and the point estimates indicate that all of the eﬀect observed in Table 2 is coming from Republicans or Democrats, instead of independents. This ﬁnding is similar to that of Franz and Ridout (2007) in their study of advertising during the 2004 election. They found that independents and moderates were not more aﬀect by messages from candidates, and the strong Democrats were more aﬀected than others (though strong Republicans were not). Along with the results from Tables 4, these results show that candidate spending is eﬀective on party identiﬁers by changing the composition of the electorate (instead of convincing people to vote for a diﬀerent candidate). Candidates use spending to decrease turnout in ways that change the pool of voters in their favor. [Insert Table 6 here] Finally, I ﬁnd one last diﬀerence across voters, though one that cannot be explained by spacial models of candidate and voter preference. Economic voting appears to play an important role in the eﬀect of candidate spending. When potential voters were asked about the current state of the economy, about 60% identiﬁed it as bad or very bad. Table 6 shows the results from a regression that interacts a dissatisfaction dummy with candidate spending. The coeﬃcient on ∆Log(Spending) means that voters who believed the economy was in good shape were unaﬀected by candidate spending. However, the interaction term shows that economically dissatisﬁed voters are especially receptive to candidate spending. If a district consisted of only economically dissat- isﬁed voters, I estimate that a $100,000 change in spending by the Republican would lead to a swing in the net vote of 0.0401 to 0.0558 in favor of that candidate. In a 2-candidate race, this would result in a 2%-2.79% increase in the vote share for the candidate. These results introduce a nuance to classical economic voting theories, which argue that voters respond to good (bad) economic conditions by rewarding (punishing) the incumbent’s party (Kramer, 1971; Powell et al. (1993)). In this framework, any such punishment of an incumbent is fully captured by the ﬁrst-diﬀerence speciﬁcation. Instead, the results indicate that negative economic shocks push 21 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019. Preprint (not copyedited or formatted).

These results show that average estimated eﬀects of candidate messages mask a large diversity of voters across diﬀerent margins and characteristics. It is important to note that these results do not indicate that high-information, independent, and economically satisﬁed voters are necessarily less likely to change their votes than others. For instance, independent voters are slightly more likely than non-independents to change their preferences after the pre-election survey. Instead, changes in voting behavior of some voters are predicted strongly by candidate spending, while changes in preferences among other voters is not. Conclusion This paper contributes to the large literature on the eﬀect on spending on political outcomes by introducing a empirical speciﬁcation that relies on within-election variation in spending and voter preferences. Though the setting studied here is the ﬁnal weeks before an election, when many voters may have already made up their minds, I ﬁnd that candidate spending has a strong eﬀect on the decisions of voters. Individual-level survey data allows me to estimate the eﬀect of spending across groups, and I ﬁnd that low-information voters, party members and economically dissatisﬁed voters are highly aﬀected by candidate spending, and that spending changes election outcomes by dissuading people from voting who would otherwise support a candidate’s opponent. The marginal eﬀect of spending found in my results is within the range of eﬀects found in the literature, despite the fact that I can only estimate the eﬀect of late-campaign spending, after hundreds of millions of dollars has been spent. This result has several possible implications. First, campaign spending may not exhibit a strong decay in marginal eﬀects; if it did, I would expect smaller marginal eﬀect in the setting studied here. Alternatively, the eﬀect of campaign spending, and especially messaging, may be short-lived. Numerous studies have found campaign messages to be most eﬀective in short-term persuasion (Kalla and Broockman, 2018; Hill et al. (2013)). Given the focus by policy-makers on late-campaign activity, as seen in rules such as lowest unit rates or blackout periods, further study on the role of money in campaigns during the ﬁnal weeks before elections could be especially illuminating. 22 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.

These results also suggest that the spending patterns of candidates in close elections (whereby most of their expenditures on messages occur in the ﬁnal month of the campaign), could be rational responses to a heavily politicized electorate. Bartels (2014) found that during the 2012 Presidential election exposure to Obama ads had a signiﬁcant but decaying eﬀect on Romney supporters. Given that the one of the most active margins in my sample was party members who were discouraged from voting, those ﬁndings from the Presidential campaign suggest that Congressional campaigns may be devoting a large portion of their spending on persuading voters late in the campaign so as to minimize the decay of that persuasion. In a polarized political environment, these ﬁndings suggest that campaigns are important, especially since non-mandatory voting makes discouragement a feasible option. Perhaps most importantly, the results suggest that researchers should focus not only on the amount, but also on the nature of spending. Even in an environment where candidates can exert signiﬁcant inﬂuence on their electoral outcomes, unbiased estimates of the marginal eﬀect of spending may ﬁnd zero eﬀect if those candidates are spending their resources on disbursements that will not change vote shares. Leavitt (1994), using a sample of repeated challengers, ﬁnds only a small eﬀect of spending on vote shares, while Erikson and Palfrey (2000) ﬁnd a large marginal eﬀect in their study of close elections. Does one of these papers oﬀer a less biased estimate of the same causal eﬀect, or do systematic diﬀerences in the composition of their populations of elections lead to two separate, unbiased estimates? Given the large amount of literature that has (out of necessity) used aggregate spending as they primary right-hand-side variable, a useful vein of future research would be to re-visit the literature’s ﬁndings using detailed disbursement data.

Online Appendix Testing for Bias in Responses To address the issue of individuals exhibiting a bias towards one of the candidates, or toward the incumbent, the ANES has employed several measures to elicit honest answers. For example, researchers recognized that when the survey asked people a series of questions about their opinion of the incumbent at the beginning of the survey, they were more likely to claim to having voted for the incumbent. To address this, the Study moved when the questions about incumbents were asked, and questions about who the individual voted for lacked any incumbent or challenger notation. Survey-takers were presented with a ballot card which featured either the name of the candidates, or a list of political parties. To discourage voters from claiming that they voted when they did not, the survey added a supplemental set of answer options, providing voters with opportunities to explain why they did not vote (e.g. “I usually vote, but didn’t this time”). This increased the percentage of respondents who claimed to have not voted to closer to the national average. Duﬀ, Brian and Michael J. Hammer and Won-ho Park and Ismail K. White (2004) found that, by oﬀering people a socially acceptable reason for not voting, over-reporting of having voting dropped. If people who over-report voting are more likely to claim to have voter for the candidate who engaged on more advertising of campaign events, over-reporting of voting could lead to a bias of my estimate of causal eﬀect. One speciﬁc issue would be if people who over-report are more likely to claim to have voted for the winner, which has been observed in past version of the National Election Study (Atkenson, 1999). Even when unobserved voter characteristics are controlled for using the ﬁrst-diﬀerence framework, since respondents do not know the identity of the winner when they take the pre-election survey, the revelation of the winner’s identify between survey rounds could lead to a biased estimate. If candidates who ultimately end up winning their elections increase their spending in the weeks leading up to election day (perhaps they want to “bury” their opponents), then a “winner bias” could lead to positive estimates of causal eﬀect even if candidate spending were useless.

To test for the existence of bias towards the winner in post-election survey, I test whether the identity of the winner predicts a change in an individual’s stated preference. I constructed a dummy variable equal to 1 if a Republican won a seat, and 0 if a Democrat won. I then regressed the change in net votes on the winner, individual characteristics, and dummy variable. The results for this regression are presented in Table A1. If over-reporting is leading to a biased estimate, I would expect a positive, signiﬁcant coeﬃcient on the Republican Win dummy. Instead, the estimate is negative and insigniﬁcant, so it is unlikely that people are erroneously claiming to have shifted their preferences towards the winner. [Insert Table 1 here] Alternate Measures of Candidate Spending The measure of candidate spending in the paper relies on decisions made be the researcher, and arguments can be made for including more categories in the primary measure of campaign spending used throughout this paper, especially Administrative Costs (Code 1), Travel (Code 2), and Materials (Code 6). [Insert Table 2 here] Table A2 has the same set of ﬁrst-diﬀerence speciﬁcations as in Table 2, except that it uses several alternative measures of candidate spending. It shows that if I include Code 1, Code 2, or Code 6 to my existing measurement (which consists of Codes 4 and 7), the direction and statistical signiﬁcance of the results are unchanged, and the point estimates actually get larger, illustrating that the main results are robust to other plausible measurements of candidate spending. Panel D shows the same results when I add fundraising (Code 3) to my existing measure. Compared to the results in Table 2, the point estimates are closer to 0, and I lose all statistical signiﬁcance. This illustrates how easily estimates of causal eﬀect can be aﬀected by the inclusion of certain types of spending, especially spending that is not being used to persuade voters. In the ﬁnal panel of Table 3, I show that when candidate spending is measured by pooling 2 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019. Preprint (not copyedited or formatted).

[Insert Table 3 here] Table A3 replicates Table 2, using all disbursements in constructing the independent variable of interest. It shows that the lack of statistical signiﬁcance seen in Table 3 is robust to all of the alternative models described in the paper. 3 Copyright The Southern Political Science Association 2019.
