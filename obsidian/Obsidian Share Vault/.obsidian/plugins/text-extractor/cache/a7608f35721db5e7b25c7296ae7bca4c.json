To do this, we administered a common questionnaire to samples obtained from three probability-based online panels, one of which was the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), and three online opt- in sample providers. The surveys were administered between June 14 and July 21, 2021, and included interviews with a total of 29,937 U.S. adults. The target size for each sample was 5,000 adults to minimize the impact of sampling error on estimates for demographic subgroups that comprise only a small percentage of the total U.S. population. Because the purpose of this study is methodological, the names of the vendors are masked. Instead, we refer to the samples as probability panels 1, 2 and 3 and opt-in samples 1, 2, and 3 throughout this report. The probability-based panels use traditional probability-based methods for recruiting a random sample of U.S. adults. Specifically, all three panels use address-based sampling (ABS) for panel recruitment. ABS begins with a random sample of households from the U.S. Post Office’s Delivery Sequence File, a near complete list of all residential addresses in the United States. Individuals in sampled households are contacted via mail and invited to join the panel and continue taking surveys periodically online. Although all three panels use similar methods for recruitment, differences in the timing and design of recruitments, the use of incentives, sampling procedures for individual panel waves, and panel maintenance practices could result in samples that are not altogether comparable to one another. The three opt-in samples in this study are based on different but common approaches to online opt-in sampling. Opt-in sample 1 comes from a panel aggregator, or marketplace, in which individual respondents are drawn from many opt-in sample sources that have agreed to make their sample available to the aggregator. Opt-in sample 2 is sourced entirely from a single opt-in panel. Opt-in sample 3 is a blend, with about three-fifths sourced from a single opt-in panel and the remainder sourced from three sample aggregators. All three opt-in samples use a common set of quotas on age by gender, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. The same weighting scheme was applied to all six samples following Pew Research Center’s standard procedure for weighting the ATP. Complete details of the weighting procedure and the design of the individual samples can be found in the methodology. 3 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org Terminology Probability-based panel: This refers to a national survey panel recruited using random sampling from a database that includes most people in the population. Today, most such panels in the United States recruit by drawing random samples of residential addresses or telephone numbers. Typically, data collection with these panels is done online. However, some of these panels interview a small fraction of respondents (usually about 5% or fewer) using an offline mode such as live telephone. These panels are “probability-based” because the chance that each address or phone number is selected is known. However, the chance that each selected person will join the panel or take surveys after joining is not known. Online opt-in sample: These samples are recruited using a variety of methods that are sometimes referred to as “convenience sampling.” Respondents are not selected randomly from the population but are recruited from a variety of online sources such as ads on social media or search engines, websites offering rewards in exchange for survey participation, or self-enrollment in an opt-in panel. Some opt-in samples are sourced from a panel (or multiple panels), while others rely on intercept techniques where respondents are invited to take a one-off survey. Benchmark: These are “ground-truth” measures used to assess the accuracy of survey estimates. For example, survey-based estimates for the share of voters who voted for each candidate in the 2020 presidential election are compared to a benchmark based on an official tally by the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Survey estimates are deemed more accurate the closer they are to the benchmark value. In this study, the benchmarks come from high-quality federal surveys such as the American Community Survey or administrative records like the FEC vote tally. Although these benchmarks come from “gold-standard” data sources, they are not entirely free from error. As such, they are not “true” population values but rather the best available approximations. Error: This is the difference between an individual survey estimate and its corresponding benchmark value. Error can be either positive or negative depending on whether the survey estimate is higher or lower than the benchmark. For example, the FEC benchmark for the share of voters who voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election is 47%. If a survey estimated that share to be 42%, the error would be -5 percentage points because it came in 5 points below the benchmark. If the estimate were 49%, the error would be +2 points. Absolute error: This is the absolute value of the error for a survey estimate. It describes the size of the error irrespective of its direction (positive or negative). For example, two estimates that have error of +5 and -5 percentage points, respectively, both have an absolute error of 5 points. 4 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org Average absolute error (for a benchmark variable): This is a measure that summarizes the average size of errors across all the categories within a single benchmark variable. For example, the smoking status variable has four categories: 1) Smoke every day, 2) Smoke some days, 3) Do not now smoke and 4) Never smoked 100 cigarettes. A survey’s estimates for each category will have different levels of error, both positive and negative. For a given survey, the absolute error for the smoking status variable is equal to the sum of the absolute errors for each category divided by the number of categories. Average absolute error (for a sample): Average absolute error can also be used to summarize the overall level of error across many different benchmarks within a single sample. When used in this context, the average absolute error for a sample is equal to the sum of the average absolute errors for each benchmark variable divided by the total number of benchmark variables. Example: Measuring error for a benchmark variable Smoking status Survey estimate Benchmark value Error Absolute error Smoke every day 15% 9% +6 6 Smoke some days 8% 3% +5 5 Do not now smoke 19% 22% -3 3 Never smoked 100 cigarettes 55% 63% -8 8 Average absolute error = (6 + 5 + 3 + 8)/4 = 5.5 Note: Benchmark values for smoking are from the 2020 National Health Interview Survey. The survey estimates shown were created as an example and do not correspond to any of the samples included in this study. PEW RESEARCH CENTER 5 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org As the field of public opinion research continues its steady movement toward online data collection, probability-based panels and opt-in samples have emerged as the two most common approaches to surveying individuals online. At the same time, the methodologies and industry practices for both kinds of samples are evolving. To shed light on the current state of online probability-based and opt-in samples, Pew Research Center conducted a study to compare the accuracy of six online surveys of U.S. adults – three from probability-based panels and three from opt-in sources. This is the first such study to include samples from multiple probability-based panels, allowing for their side-by-side comparison. The surveys in this study were administered between June 14 and July 21, 2021, and included interviews with a total of 29,937 U.S. adults, approximately 5,000 in each sample. Because this is a methodological study, the names of the sample providers are masked. The study compared each sample’s accuracy on 28 benchmark variables drawn from high-quality government data sources. These benchmarks included a variety of measures on topics such as voting, health, and respondents’ work, family and living situations. (Refer to the appendix for the full list of benchmarks and their sources.) The study’s key findings include: On average, error on opt-in samples was about twice that of probability-based panels For estimates among U.S. adults on 28 benchmark variables, opt-in samples 1, 2 and 3 had average absolute errors of 6.4, 6.1 and 5.0, respectively, for an overall average of 5.8 percentage points. This was about twice that of the probability-based online panels, for which average absolute error was 2.6 points overall (2.3, 3.0 and 2.5 on probability panels 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Comparing Two Types of Online Survey Samples Opt-in samples are about half as accurate as probability-based panels 6 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org Online opt-in samples had especially large errors for 18- to 29-year-olds and Hispanic adults On 25 variables for which subgroup-level benchmarks were available, the online opt-in samples averaged 11.2 percentage points of error for 18- to 29-year- olds and 10.8 points for Hispanic adults– each about 5 points higher than for U.S. adults overall (6.4 points on the same 25 variables). By comparison, the average absolute error on the probability-based panels was 3.6 points for both young adults and Hispanic adults, less than 2 points higher than the error for all adults. A similar level of error was seen on the probability-based panels for other traditionally hard-to-survey subgroups such as those with no more than a high school education (3.6 points) and non-Hispanic Black adults (3.8 points). Error was concentrated in a handful of variables on the probability-based panels but widespread on the opt-in samples On each of the probability-based panels, the number of benchmarks for which average absolute error was greater than 5 percentage points ranged from two to five out of 28. About half (between 14 and 15 benchmarks) had under 2 points of average absolute error. Large errors were more widespread on the opt-in samples, which had between 11 and 17 benchmarks with error greater than 5 points. Fewer benchmarks (between three and seven) on the opt-in samples had average absolute error below 2 points. Probability-based panels consistently overestimated 2020 voter turnout The only benchmark that had consistently high error on all three probability-based panels was voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election, which they each overestimated by +8 or +9 percentage points. This suggests that despite the inclusion of volunteerism and voter registration in weighting adjustments, the overrepresentation of politically and civically engaged individuals remains an important challenge for probability-based panels. By contrast, turnout was one of the Larger errors on online opt-in samples, especially for 18- to 29-year-olds and Hispanic adults Average absolute error on benchmark variables Probability-based panels Opt-In samples All adults 26@ | @s5.8 : Ages 18-29 | 36@ | { @112 Hispanic | 3.6@ : : @10.8 i i 0 5 10 Average absolute error (percentage points) Note: Results shown are the mean value of the average absolute errors across three probability-based panels and across three online opt-in samples.

PEW RESEARCH CENTER 7 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org most accurate variables on the opt-in samples, two of which came within 1 point of the benchmark while the third exceeded the benchmark by +3 points. Much of the error on the opt-in samples appears to be due to ‘bogus respondents,’ who usually say ‘Yes’ regardless of the question In the online opt-in samples, an average of 8% of all adults, 15% of 18- to 29-year-olds and 19% of Hispanic adults answered “Yes” on at least 10 out of 16 Yes/No questions that were asked of every respondent. The corresponding shares on the probability-based panels were between 1% and 2% for each group. Similarly large shares reported having received at least three of four types of government benefits (Social Security, food stamps, unemployment compensation or workers’ compensation) even though such individuals are virtually nonexistent in the true population. It is highly unlikely that the few individuals who do fit that description are massively overrepresented in online opt-in samples. Instead, this pattern suggests that much of the error on the online opt-in samples is due to the presence of “bogus respondents,” who make little or no effort to answer questions truthfully. Polling insiders may wonder why we conducted this study. Other research teams (including our own several years ago) have done similar comparisons and arrived at the same result: Probability- based samples tend to be more accurate, even if recent election polls are an exception. One major reason we conducted this study is because it offers something new. This benchmarking study is the first to estimate the accuracy of multiple online probability-based panels in the United States. This allows us to answer a previously unaddressed question: Do different probability-based panels tend to offer similar data quality or not? The three probability-based panels tested in this study performed about the same. The average absolute error ranged from just 2.3 to 3.0 percentage points – good news for researchers seeking a reliable polling method. It’s worth noting that this study considered fairly general topics (e.g., employment, marital status), and that the results might differ if a survey focused on a more niche topic, like poverty. The second major reason we conducted this study was that in the time since our 2016 study, there have been a number of major changes to the ATP’s methodology made in response to that study’s findings, other challenges that have arisen in the intervening years, and the Center’s evolving research needs: ▪ We changed how we recruit, moving from telephone to an address-based approach. ▪ We began subsampling the panel rather than routinely interviewing everyone. What is new about this benchmarking study? 8 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org ▪ We changed how we weight the panel, adding in adjustments for volunteerism, religion and other factors. ▪ We began retiring panelists from overrepresented segments of the population. The study reported here is, in part, our effort to measure whether those improvements made a difference, allowing us to determine how the new, improved ATP stacks up against opt-in samples and against other probability-based panels. 9 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org 1. Assessing the accuracy of estimates for U.S. adults To gauge each sample’s accuracy on general population estimates for all U.S. adults, we calculated the weighted percentage of adults belonging to 77 categories across 28 different variables and compared them to corresponding benchmarks derived from high-quality government data sources. The benchmarks covered a variety of topics, including voting, health, and respondents’ work, family and living situations. (Refer to the appendix for the full list of benchmarks and their sources.) Because many of the benchmark variables included more than one category, we calculated each variable’s average absolute error – that is, the average of the absolute differences between the survey estimate and a corresponding benchmark value for each category – to compare the relative accuracy of variables that have different numbers of categories. To facilitate more general comparisons between samples overall, we also calculated the average absolute error for each sample as the mean of the average absolute errors across all 28 benchmarks. In any study of this kind, it is important to note that the performance of any given sample depends on numerous factors such as the variables used in weighting or the specific topics included in the benchmarks. It is possible that the relative accuracy of each sample might differ if we had used a different weighting scheme or chosen a different set of benchmarks for comparison. Furthermore, not even “gold-standard” government statistics are entirely free from error. Consequently, the measures of error discussed in this report should be considered approximate. Across all 28 benchmarks combined, the probability-based panels had a mean average absolute error of 2.6 percentage points for estimates among all U.S. adults. The error for individual probability-based panels ranged from a low of 2.3 points for probability panel 1 to a high of 3.0 points for probability panel 2.

PEW RESEARCH CENTER Probability 1 10 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org about twice as large at 5.8 points. Of these, opt-in sample 3 had the lowest average error at 5.0 points. Opt-in samples 1 and 2 exhibited higher error on average with 6.4 and 6.1 points, respectively. For ease of explanation, individual benchmark variables whose average absolute error was less than 2 percentage points were classified as having “low” error. Variables with more than 5 points of average absolute error were defined as having “high” error, and the remainder were coded as having “medium” error. These particular groupings were chosen because they each contain about one-third of all benchmarks from all six samples. It is important to note that these designations of low, medium or high error are relative to the specific benchmarks and samples included in this study. Opt-in samples had many more benchmarks with large errors than probability- based panels Average absolute error for estimates among U.S. adults on 28 benchmark variables.

The only variable with consistently high error on the probability-based panels was voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election, for which all three samples overestimated the benchmark by +8 or +9 percentage points. This is consistent with our 2016 study, which found civically engaged adults to be overrepresented on the American Trends Panel, and suggests that the problem afflicts ABS-recruited panels more generally. This overall pattern was reversed for the opt-in samples, on which 51% of benchmarks fell in the high error category, compared with 20% in the low error category. There were 10 variables with consistently high error on the opt-in samples. Four involved the receipt of certain government benefits in the prior year. On average, the opt-in samples overestimated the shares of adults receiving food stamps (+16 points), Social Security (+15 points), unemployment compensation (+10 points) and workers’ compensation (+9 points). Another three variables with consistently high error related to employment, with the opt-in samples underestimating the share of all adults who worked for pay in the prior week by -12 points on average and the share of adults who worked at a job or business at any time in the prior year by -11 points on average. The opt-in samples also overstated the share of adults who were employed but had been unable to work in the past month because of COVID-19 by an average of +7 points.

Finally, all three opt-in samples overstated the share of adults who live in carless or single-car households by an average of +6 and +15 points, respectively. At the other end of the spectrum, there were seven variables with consistently low error on all three probability-based panels. These included parental status, number of children in the household, marital status, housing tenure, smoking status, English language proficiency and candidate vote share in the 2020 presidential election. Two of these, English proficiency and 2020 vote share, also had consistently low error on all three opt-in samples. Citizenship status also had consistently low error on the opt-in samples. 14 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org 2. Assessing the accuracy of estimates among demographic subgroups The accuracy of general population estimates is only one facet of data quality for online samples. Frequently, survey researchers also want to understand the similarities and differences between subgroups within the population. For probability-based panels recruited using ABS, obtaining a sufficiently large sample of respondents belonging to small subgroups can be particularly costly, and one selling point for the use of online opt-in samples is their ability to obtain a large number of interviews with members of hard-to-reach groups at comparatively low cost. To evaluate the relative accuracy of benchmark subgroup estimates, average absolute error was calculated for each of the samples among subgroups defined by age, education, and race and ethnicity across 25 variables for which subgroup benchmarks were available.1 The groups with the largest error across the probability-based panels were adults ages 18 to 29, adults with no more than a high school education, Hispanic adults and non-Hispanic Black adults, which averaged between 3.6 and 3.8 percentage points of error across the three panels. This is about 1 to 2 points less accurate than the other 1 The benchmarks for COVID-19 vaccination status, 2020 presidential vote choice and 2020 presidential election turnout are based on administrative records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Election Commission and on figures produced by the United States Elections Project. While these administrative benchmarks are reliable at the national level, they do not allow for the calculation of reliable benchmarks within demographic subgroups and are not used in calculations of average absolute error for subgroups. While the Community Population Survey Voting Supplement can be used to compute subgroup-level estimates for voter turnout, recent scholarship has shown these to be severely biased, substantially overestimating turnout among racial minorities and underestimating turnout among non-Hispanic White voters.

PEW RESEARCH CENTER 15 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org subgroups, which all had average errors between 1.7 and 2.6 points. By comparison, the opt-in samples had larger error on average for every subgroup, and the differences between the most accurate and least accurate subgroups were much larger. This pattern was most striking for age groups. Here, estimates for adults ages 65 and older on the opt- in samples had an average error of 2.6 points, making them nearly as accurate as the probability- based panels. Their average error was higher for ages 30 to 64, at 7.5 points. Average error was highest for those ages 18 to 29, at 11.2 points – about four times as large as the error for ages 65 and older. Error for racial and ethnic groups in the opt-in samples showed a similar pattern. Estimates among non-Hispanic White adults were the most accurate, with an overall average absolute error of 5.8 points across the three opt-in samples. Average error among non-Hispanic Black adults was somewhat larger, at 7.2 points, while the average error among Hispanic adults was almost twice as large, at 10.8 points. Large errors on the opt-in samples were also observed regardless of panelists’ level of education. Average errors ranged from 6.0 points for people with some college education to 6.8 points for those with a high school diploma or less. Opt-in samples had large errors on receipt of government benefits and other variables among 18- to 29-year-olds and Hispanic adults What factors explain the particularly large errors for 18- to 29-year-olds and Hispanic adults on the opt-in samples? While estimates for both groups are characterized by larger errors on a greater The four benchmarks related to the receipt of government benefits, which had some of the very largest errors for full-sample estimates, had dramatically larger errors for these groups. The opt-in samples overestimated the share of all adults who received food stamps in the past year by an average of +16 percentage points. This overestimation was higher on average among 18- to 29- year-olds (+24) and Hispanic adults (+25). Receipt of Social Security benefits, which had an average error of +15 points for all adults, had errors of +24 for 18- to 29-year-olds and +20 for Hispanic adults. On average, receipt of unemployment compensation was overestimated by +10 points for all adults, +18 points for 18- to 29-year-olds and +21 points for Hispanic adults. Finally, receipt of workers’ compensation had an average error of +9 points for all adults, compared with a much higher +23 points for 18- to 29-year-olds and +22 points for Hispanic adults. For another seven variables, the average absolute error for both 18- to 29-year-olds and Hispanic adults was between 5 and 10 points higher than the error for all adults. These variables included 16 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org whether one’s work was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, having a food allergy, union membership, military service, 1-year migration status, parental status and U.S. citizenship. Similar differences in the magnitude of error were also seen for 18- to 29-year-olds on the benchmarks for high blood pressure, housing tenure and English language proficiency, and for Hispanic adults on e-cigarette usage. The concentration of disproportionately large errors on so many variables within two specific subgroups raises the question of whether these are primarily errors of representation or measurement. For example, are 18- to 29-year-olds who received food stamps simply overrepresented because some aspect of the data collection process makes them much more likely to participate in online opt-in surveys than other 18- to 29-year- olds? Or are these respondents reporting that they received food stamps when in truth they did not? While this study cannot definitively rule out the possibility these individuals are answering honestly, many respondents to the opt-in surveys answered combinations of questions in ways that are more plausibly explained by individual misreporting than the overrepresentation of certain groups. On opt-in samples, 18- to 29-year-olds and Hispanic adults show especially large errors on many of the same variables Average absolute error on opt-in samplesfor estimates among all U.S. adults, 18- to 29-year-olds and Hispanic adults.

PEW RESEARCH CENTER 17 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org The population benchmarks for receipt of government benefits in the previous year (food stamps, Social Security, unemployment compensation and workers’ compensation) provide one such example. All of these benchmarks come from the 2021 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC), which makes it possible to compute benchmarks for not only the share who received each individual benefit but also for the number of different benefits received. Almost two-thirds of all U.S. adults (62%) did not receive any of these benefits, while 38% received either one or two, according to CPS ASEC data. Adults who received three or four of these benefits comprise only 0.1% of the full U.S. adult population and no more than 0.2% of any demographic subgroup included in this analysis. By comparison, the estimated share of adults who received three or four benefits ranged from 6% to 9% on the three opt-in samples. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, estimated shares varied between 15% and 18%; for Hispanic adults, those shares were and between 16% and 19%. On all three probability-based panels, the corresponding estimates were 1% for all adults, between 1% and 2% for 18- to 29-year-olds and between 1% and 3% for Hispanic adults. It is difficult to see how a group that makes up just a fraction of a percent of the population could come to comprise almost one-in-ten of all respondents, and nearly one-in-five of both 18- to 29-year-old and Hispanic respondents on online opt-in samples. A more straightforward explanation would be a group of respondents who are disproportionately choosing the “Yes” answer rather than answering truthfully. The large errors in estimates among 18- to 29-year-old and Hispanic adults are also consistent with a 2020 Center study that found so-called “bogus respondents” – respondents who make little or no effort to answer survey questions truthfully – disproportionately claimed to be either Hispanic or 18 to 29 years old. Looking at Yes/No questions more broadly, there remains a consistent pattern. Not counting the question asking respondents if they identify as Hispanic or Latino, there were 12 additional Yes/No questions on the survey that were asked of Some opt-in respondents tend to answer Yes' regardless of the question Average % of U.S. adults who answered \"Yes\" to at least 10 of 16 Yes/No questions HB Opt-in samples EH Probabllity-based panels All adults 8%| Ages 18-29 15|30-64|65+QoPw HS or less1 Some college College gradof oEN[4][EY[= White non-Hispanic 3 Black non-Hispanic Hispanic 19|Note: Results shown are the mean value across three probability-based panels and across three online opt-in samples. Source: Pew Research Center analysis of six online samples surveyed June 14-July 21, 2021. PEW RESEARCH CENTER 18 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org all respondents, bringing the total number of Yes/No questions to 16. On the probability-based panels, an average of 1% of all adults, 1% of 18- to 29-year-olds and 2% of Hispanic adults answered “Yes” to 10 or more of these questions. On the opt-in samples, the corresponding averages were 8% of all adults, 15% of 18- to 29-year-olds and 19% of Hispanic adults. These results are consistent with the presence of a sizeable group of respondents to the opt-in samples being systematically more likely to answer in the affirmative to Yes/No questions in general. It is notable that among adults ages 65 and older on the opt-in samples, those saying “Yes” to 10 or more questions comprised only a fraction of a percent on average. This suggests that an absence of bogus respondents within this age group may be a primary reason its accuracy in the opt-in samples was comparable to that of the probability-based panels. One possible reason for this absence may be that on survey measured age by asking respondents to select their year of birth from a drop-down menu with more recent years at the top. Selecting a year of birth corresponding to ages 65 and older would have required more effort than one corresponding to ages 18 to 29, which were much higher up on the list. It is unclear whether a different answer format would have yielded different results. These findings should not be taken to mean that people who are truly 18 to 29 years old or Hispanic are more likely to misrepresent themselves in online opt-in surveys. It is more likely that individuals who misreport on questions of substantive interest also do so for demographics such as race and age as well. Individuals who are simply attempting to earn survey incentives may be strategically selecting the answer choices they believe are most likely to meet any eligibility criteria for survey participation and least likely to result in being screened out. It is possible that many of the Yes/No questions on the survey resemble the kinds of questions that are commonly used to screen for identify specific subgroups of interest. For example, a bogus respondent seeing a question asking if they have ever vaped may suspect that researchers are conducting a survey of e- cigarette users and that answering “No” would lead to their being screened out. This would be consistent with one recent study that found evidence of widespread falsification intended to get around screening questions in an online opt-in sample. These conclusions are necessarily speculative, as this study was not designed to measure the response strategies of bogus respondents, and this remains an important subject for future research. However, the fact that such a large portion of the error on the opt-in samples appears attributable to bogus responding that is disproportionately concentrated within specific demographic groups has important implications for practice. The weighting and modeling methods that are most commonly used to adjust for differences between opt-in samples and the larger population are premised on an assumption that the adjustment variables accurately describe the respondents 19 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org (e.g. that respondents who say they are Hispanic are, in fact, Hispanic) and that what error exists is small and not strongly correlated with substantive variables of interest. Here, we have seen that error in adjustment variables like age and Hispanic ethnicity appears to be both widespread in opt-in samples and strongly associated with responses to at least Yes/No questions but potentially other kinds of questions where the behavior is not as straightforwardly detectable. While this study did not include trap questions or attention checks, past studies have found such questions to be unsuccessful in identifying bogus respondents. Under such circumstances, there is little reason to expect these kinds of adjustment methods to be successful in the absence of better methods for detecting bogus respondents. That these kinds of response behaviors appear to be much less common in probability-based panels is heartening and supports a different set of methodological research priorities, particularly correcting the overrepresentation of the most politically and civically engaged respondents. 20 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org Acknowledgments This report was made possible by The Pew Charitable Trusts.

Three of the samples were sourced from different probability-based online panels, one of which was Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP). The remaining three samples came from three different online opt-in sample providers. The study included interviews with a total of 29,937 U.S. adults, approximately 5,000 in each of the samples. Interviews were conducted in both English and Spanish. Because the purpose of this study is methodological, the names of the vendors are masked and the samples are referred to as probability panels 1, 2 and 3 and opt-in samples 1, 2 and 3. The ATP cases were surveyed using normal procedures. For probability panel 3, the survey was programmed and administered by the vendor who administers that panel. The surveys for the remaining probability-based panel and the three opt-in samples were programmed and administered by a coordinating vendor. The research aims of the study were not discussed with the coordinating vendor and only the questionnaire was provided to the coordinating vendor in advance. On the probability panels, some questions were not asked if a comparable profile variable from a previous survey could be used instead. These questions are identified in the questionnaire.

The cumulative response rate to the survey (accounting for nonresponse to recruitment, to the current survey and for panel attrition) was 7%. Sample design The probability-based panels used in this study all currently recruit using address-based sampling (ABS) in which a random sample of households selected from the U.S. Postal Service’s Delivery Sequence File. This Postal Service file has been estimated to cover as much as 98% of the population, although some studies suggest that the coverage could be in the low 90% range.2 The ATP cases included in this study are a subset of the respondents to ATP Wave 91. All 11,699 active ATP members were invited to participate in Wave 91, of which 10,606 completed the survey. To achieve an analytic sample of ATP respondents equivalent in size to the other samples included in this study, we drew a stratified random sample of the 11,699 active panelists following the procedure that would have been used to obtain a target sample size of n=5,000 on Wave 91. The panelists who were both selected for this analytic sample and completed Wave 91 are treated as completes for purposes of inclusion in this study. This is the exact set of respondents who would have been observed if only the subsample of the panel had been invited. The remaining probability-based samples were selected following each vendor’s normal procedure for achieving a target sample size of n=5,000 U.S. adults. The three opt-in samples in this study each use a different approach to online opt-in sampling. Opt-in sample 1 comes from a panel aggregator, or marketplace, in which individual respondents are drawn from many opt-in sample sources that have agreed to make their sample available to the aggregator. Opt-in sample 2 is sourced entirely from a single opt-in panel. Opt-in sample 3 is a blend, with about three-fifths sourced from a single opt-in panel and the remainder sourced from three sample aggregators. All three opt-in samples set quotas for age by gender, race and ethnicity, and education based on estimates from the 2019 American Community Survey. 2 AAPOR Task Force on Address-based Sampling. 2016. “AAPOR Report: Address-based Sampling.” 23 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org Opt-in sample quotas Age x Gender % Race/Ethnicity % Education % Men, 18-44 22.8 White/Other/2+ races, non- Hispanic 71.7 High school or less 38.6 Women, 18-44 22.8 Black non-Hispanic 11.8 Some college 30 Men, 45-64 16 Hispanic 16.5 Bachelor’s degree or more 31.4 Women, 45-64 17.1 Men, 65+ 9.5 Women, 65+ 11.8 Total 100 100 100 PEW RESEARCH CENTER Data quality checks No special data quality checks were performed on any of the probability-based panels. For the opt-in samples, the coordinating vendor applied checks for speeding, straightlining and duplicate cases along with other proprietary data quality checks. As a result, a total of 104 cases from opt-in sample 1, 86 from opt-in sample 2, and 69 from opt-in sample 3 were removed for poor data quality. Note: Quota targets are from the 2019 American Community Survey. No quota was set for the number of respondents who identify as something other than a man or a woman.

PEW RESEARCH CENTER 24 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org Weighting All six samples were weighted following the standard procedure used on ATP Wave 91. For the probability-based panels, this began with a base weight that accounted for differential probabilities of being invited to join the panel, adjustments for panel attrition, and the probability that each panelist was invited to participate in this specific survey. Base weights for each panel were provided by their vendors. Because opt-in samples do not have any known probabilities of selection, all respondents in the opt-in samples were assigned a base weight of 1. The base weight for each sample was then calibrated to align with population benchmarks listed in the accompanying table. © Pew Research Center 2023 1 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org Appendix: Benchmarks and measures of error by sample 2021 American Community Survey Military service Benchmark (%) Prob. mean Prob. 1 Prob. 2 Prob. 3 Opt-in mean Opt-in 1 Opt-in 2 Opt-in 3 Never served in the military 91.9 -2.9 -4.8 -3.7 -12.4 -12.6 -9.5 Only on active duty for training in the Reserves or National Guard 1.2 +0.7 +1.4 +0.7 +5.4 +4.8 +3.2 Now on active duty 0.5 +0.2 +0.9 +0.2 +1.8 +2.6 +1.6 On active duty in the past, but not now 6.4 +1.5 +2.5 +1.9 +4.5 +3.5 +3.9 Average absolute error 1.8 1.3 2.4 1.6 5.5 6.0 5.9 4.5 Type of dwelling Benchmark (%) Prob. mean Prob. 1 Prob. 2 Prob. 3 Opt-in mean Opt-in 1 Opt-in 2 Opt-in 3 A mobile home 5.0 +0.2 +0.6 +1.4 +4.7 +4.0 +2.4 A one-family house detached from any other house 67.8 -1.5 -4.4 -5.9 -12.0 -10.7 -6.1 A one-family house attached to one or more houses 6.2 +2.1 +3.3 +2.6 +4.2 +4.6 +3.6 A building with two or more apartments 20.9 -2.1 -0.9 +0.2 +0.5 -1.7 -2.2 Boat, RV, van, etc. 0.1 +0.5 +0.6 +0.8 +1.7 +1.8 +1.0 Average absolute error 1.8 1.3 1.9 2.2 4.1 4.6 4.6 3.0 Housing tenure Benchmark (%) Prob. mean Prob. 1 Prob. 2 Prob. 3 Opt-in mean Opt-in 1 Opt-in 2 Opt-in 3 Owned by you or someone in your household with a mortgage or loan (include home equity loans) 43.9 +0.0 +0.9 -3.1 -8.2 -9.0 -5.9 Owned by you or someone in your household free and clear (without a mortgage or loan) 25.3 -1.1 -2.9 -1.4 +0.5 +4.7 +5.6 Rented 29.3 -1.5 +1.1 +2.3 +4.4 -0.3 -1.9 Occupied without payment of rent 1.5 +0.9 +0.2 +1.2 +2.0 +1.8 +1.0 Average absolute error 1.4 0.9 1.3 2.0 3.8 3.8 3.9 3.6 Note: Benchmark estimates are based on noninstitutionalized adults.

Initial analyses showed all samples exceeding the CPS benchmark by a large margin. Investigation of this finding revealed several studies showing that the CPS severely underestimates retirement income and account possession, and that the large errors were most likely due to an unreliable benchmark. Consequently, this report instead uses a comparable benchmark from the Survey of Income and Program Participation determined to be more reliable.
