Google C loud, Google’s cloud services and products division, is collaborating with Highmark Health, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit healthcare company, on generative A I tools designed to personalize the patient intake experience. A mazon’s A WS division says it’s working with unnamed customers on a way to use generative A I to analyze medical databases for “social determinants of health.” A nd Microsoft A zure is 4/14/24, 3:43 PM Generative A I is coming for healthcare, and not everyone’s thrilled | TechC runch chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/7 helping to build a generative A I system for Providence, the not-for-profit healthcare network, to automatically triage messages to care providers sent from patients. Prominent generative A I startups in healthcare include A mbience Healthcare, which is developing a generative A I app for clinicians; Nabla, an ambient A I assistant for practitioners; and A bridge, which creates analytics tools for medical documentation. The broad enthusiasm for generative A I is reflected in the investments in generative A I efforts targeting healthcare. C ollectively, generative A I in healthcare startups have raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital to date, and the vast majority of health investors say that generative A I has significantly influenced their investment strategies. B ut both professionals and patients are mixed as to whether healthcare-focused generative A I is ready for prime time. Generative AI might not be what people want In a recent D eloitte survey, only about half (53%) of U.S. consumers said that they thought generative A I could improve healthcare — for example, by making it more accessible or shortening appointment wait times. Fewer than half said they expected generative A I to make medical care more affordable. A ndrew B orkowski, chief A I officer at the VA Sunshine Healthcare Network, the U.S. D epartment of Veterans A ffairs’ largest health system, doesn’t think that the cynicism is unwarranted. B orkowski warned that generative A I’s deployment could be premature due to its “significant” limitations — and the concerns around its efficacy. 4/14/24, 3:43 PM Generative A I is coming for healthcare, and not everyone’s thrilled | TechC runch chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 3/7 “One of the key issues with generative A I is its inability to handle complex medical queries or emergencies,” he told TechC runch. “Its finite knowledge base — that is, the absence of up-to-date clinical information — and lack of human expertise make it unsuitable for providing comprehensive medical advice or treatment recommendations.” Several studies suggest there’s credence to those points. In a paper in the journal JA MA Pediatrics, OpenA I’s generative A I chatbot, C hatGPT, which some healthcare organizations have piloted for limited use cases, was found to make errors diagnosing pediatric diseases 83% of the time. A nd in testing OpenA I’s GPT-4 as a diagnostic assistant, physicians at B eth Israel D eaconess Medical C enter in B oston observed that the model ranked the wrong diagnosis as its top answer nearly two times out of three. Today’s generative A I also struggles with medical administrative tasks that are part and parcel of clinicians’ daily workflows. On the MedA lign benchmark to evaluate how well generative A I can perform things like summarizing patient health records and searching across notes, GPT-4 failed in 35% of cases. OpenA I and many other generative A I vendors warn against relying on their models for medical advice. B ut B orkowski and others say they could do more. “Relying solely on generative A I for healthcare could lead to misdiagnoses, inappropriate treatments or even life-threatening situations,” B orkowski said. Jan Egger, who leads A I-guided therapies at the University of D uisburg-Essen’s Institute for A I in Medicine, which studies the applications of emerging technology for patient care, shares B orkowski’s concerns. He believes that the only safe way to use 4/14/24, 3:43 PM Generative A I is coming for healthcare, and not everyone’s thrilled | TechC runch chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 4/7 generative A I in healthcare currently is under the close, watchful eye of a physician. “The results can be completely wrong, and it’s getting harder and harder to maintain awareness of this,” Egger said. “Sure, generative A I can be used, for example, for pre-writing discharge letters. B ut physicians have a responsibility to check it and make the final call.” Generative AI can perpetuate stereotypes One particularly harmful way generative A I in healthcare can get things wrong is by perpetuating stereotypes. In a 2023 study out of Stanford Medicine, a team of researchers tested C hatGPT and other generative A I– powered chatbots on questions about kidney function, lung capacity and skin thickness. Not only were C hatGPT’s answers frequently wrong, the co-authors found, but also answers included several reinforced long-held untrue beliefs that there are biological differences between B lack and white people — untruths that are known to have led medical providers to misdiagnose health problems. The irony is, the patients most likely to be discriminated against by generative A I for healthcare are also those most likely to use it. People who lack healthcare coverage — people of color, by and large, according to a KFF study — are more willing to try generative A I for things like finding a doctor or mental health support, the D eloitte survey showed. If the A I’s recommendations are marred by bias, it could exacerbate inequalities in treatment. However, some experts argue that generative A I is improving in this regard. 4/14/24, 3:43 PM Generative A I is coming for healthcare, and not everyone’s thrilled | TechC runch chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 5/7 In a Microsoft study published in late 2023, researchers said they achieved 90.2% accuracy on four challenging medical benchmarks using GPT-4. Vanilla GPT-4 couldn’t reach this score. B ut, the researchers say, through prompt engineering — designing prompts for GPT-4 to produce certain outputs — they were able to boost the model’s score by up to 16.2 percentage points. (Microsoft, it’s worth noting, is a major investor in OpenA I.) Beyond chatbots B ut asking a chatbot a question isn’t the only thing generative A I is good for. Some researchers say that medical imaging could benefit greatly from the power of generative A I. In July, a group of scientists unveiled a system called complementarity-driven deferral to clinical workflow (C oD oC ), in a study published in Nature. The system is designed to figure out when medical imaging specialists should rely on A I for diagnoses versus traditional techniques. C oD oC did better than specialists while reducing clinical workflows by 66%, according to the co-authors. In November, a C hinese research team demoed Panda, an A I model used to detect potential pancreatic lesions in X-rays. A study showed Panda to be highly accurate in classifying these lesions, which are often detected too late for surgical intervention. Indeed, A run Thirunavukarasu, a clinical research fellow at the University of Oxford, said there’s “nothing unique” about generative A I precluding its deployment in healthcare settings. “More mundane applications of generative A I technology are feasible in the short- and mid-term, and include text correction, automatic documentation of notes and letters and improved search features to optimize electronic patient records,” he said. “There’s 4/14/24, 3:43 PM Generative A I is coming for healthcare, and not everyone’s thrilled | TechC runch chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 6/7 no reason why generative A I technology — if effective — couldn’t be deployed in these sorts of roles immediately.” “Rigorous science” B ut while generative A I shows promise in specific, narrow areas of medicine, experts like B orkowski point to the technical and compliance roadblocks that must be overcome before generative A I can be useful — and trusted — as an all-around assistive healthcare tool. “Significant privacy and security concerns surround using generative A I in healthcare,” B orkowski said. “The sensitive nature of medical data and the potential for misuse or unauthorized access pose severe risks to patient confidentiality and trust in the healthcare system. Furthermore, the regulatory and legal landscape surrounding the use of generative A I in healthcare is still evolving, with questions regarding liability, data protection and the practice of medicine by non-human entities still needing to be solved.” Even Thirunavukarasu, bullish as he is about generative A I in healthcare, says that there needs to be “rigorous science” behind tools that are patient- facing. “Particularly without direct clinician oversight, there should be pragmatic randomized control trials demonstrating clinical benefit to justify deployment of patient-facing generative A I,” he said. “Proper governance going forward is essential to capture any unanticipated harms following deployment at scale.” Recently, the World Health Organization released guidelines that advocate for this type of science and human oversight of generative A I in healthcare as well as the introduction of auditing, transparency and impact assessments on this A I by independent third parties. The goal, the WHO spells out in its guidelines, 4/14/24, 3:43 PM Generative A I is coming for healthcare, and not everyone’s thrilled | TechC runch chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 7/7 would be to encourage participation from a diverse cohort of people in the development of generative A I for healthcare and an opportunity to voice concerns and provide input throughout the process. “Until the concerns are adequately addressed and appropriate safeguards are put in place,” B orkowski said, “the widespread implementation of medical generative A I may be … potentially harmful to patients and the healthcare industry as a whole.”","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
