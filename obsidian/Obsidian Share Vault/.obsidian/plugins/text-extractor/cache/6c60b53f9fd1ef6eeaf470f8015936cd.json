Thus, Nempy could be useful as a building block to create agent based models of the NEM, and play a role in answering various questions about market operational outcomes. - . i Such questions could include The fouoymg inputs and features would be useful in forecasting the AEMO ° market price: - How does changing the demand for electricity affect market outcomes? - How does the entry of new generating technologies affect market outcomes? - How do patterns « SCADA measurements of the power system of generator ownership affect market outcomes? * Fivo-piinuie demand forceast valugs Of course, another necessary component of agent based models are the behavioural g:;‘t:;’r'e\";::]'f\"\"\"s SRISIEEbYARMO models of the agents, a prototype behavioural model of NEM participants is being e e developed as part of the NEMPRO project (Gorman, 2021). » Loadditn 3.To answer counter factual questions about historical dispatch outcomes.

AEMO offers access to a production version of the market dispatch engine to allow participants to answer such questions (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021a). However, access is restricted to registered participants and is provided at a cost of $15,000 per year.
