However, relatively little attention has been paid tothe impact AI has already had on the labour market. This column investigates the effect of generative AI models on affectedprofessions, using data from an online labour platform showing that AI has diminished the potential earnings of exposed writers andimage-related professionals across skills distribution.AUTHORSXiang HuiOren ReshefLuofeng ZhouFrom its nascent stages, beginning in the 1950s, arti\u0000cial intelligence (AI) has evolved through distinct phases, experiencing notableadvancements in the 21st century with the proliferation of machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. These innovationsexpanded AI's footprint, embedding it within various aspects of modern life, including communication, healthcare, transportation, \u0000nance,and entertainment. Currently, AI stands at the forefront of technological progress, shaping routines and augmenting human capabilities.Recent developments and the rapid adoption of generative AI models have dramatically improved performance over previous versions, withthe potential for far-ranging economic and societal e\u0000ects.Historically, AI discussions have o\u0000en centered on generative statistical models which, compared to descriptive models, require much moredata and computing power to support reliable inferences. However, the landscape has shi\u0000ed with the advent of enhanced computationalXiang Hui ,Oren Reshef ,Luofeng Zhou VOXEU COLUMNLABOUR MARKETSPOVERTY AND INCOME INEQUALITY https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/artificial-intelligence-and-its-short-term-effects-employment#:~:text=If anything%2C evidence suggests that,reduci… 1/6power and unprecedented volumes of data. This evolution has propelled generative models to achieve remarkable outcomes (e.g. Charnesset al. 2023). For instance, models like generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated groundbreaking capabilities in generatingrealistic data, images, and even text in speci\u0000c contexts like pattern shi\u0000ing and machine translation.One of the most recent image-based generative AI models, Midjourney, made an immediate impression on the general audience through itsremarkable achievements. Midjourney produces pictures with textual and graphic inputs with various styles. Its capacity to generateastounding results in various creative domains is undeniable. What sets Midjourney apart is its ability to deliver exceptional outcomes. Itsimpact, though powerful, appears to be contained within a particular horizon, operating within de\u0000ned boundaries that respect the creativeprowess and input of human content creators. This nuanced approach strikes a delicate balance, showcasing the potential for AIaugmentation without overshadowing or displacing the human creative process, positioning Midjourney as a complementary tool in thecreative realm but a potential threat for graphic engineers.Most recently, ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM) launched by OpenAI, has drawn even more attention given its generality. ChatGPTenables human-machine interaction in the way of dialogue in natural language. In addition to small talk and knowledge provision, ChatGPTand its variant GPT-based models appear to have the power to be rational and are used to assist academic research. Terrance Tao, a FieldʼsMedal, posted multiple tweets and blogs to praise GPT for helping him in mathematical research. However, a leading scholar in AI, YannLeCun, is pessimistic about LLMs because of potential misinformation. Nonetheless, ChatGPT continuously attracts more user andattention, and generate externality even for attention of AI. Figure 1 shows Google Trends of AI, GPT, and Midjourney & Dall-E 2. There is aclear increasing pattern a\u0000er November 2022, and ChatGPT adoption also has visible spillover to the general AI. In contrast, the release ofMidjourney and Dall-E 2 received less general attention and was concentrated in a narrower set of sub\u0000elds.Figure 1 Descriptive evidence on interest in ChatGPT over timeEffects of AI on labour marketsA central question organisations face is whether, over time, AI technologies will substitute workers by fully replacing human input orcomplement workers by augmenting human labours(Choudhury et al. 2020, Noy and Zhang 2023). This issue has led to a vigorous discussionamong policymakers and industry leaders regarding the potential promises and perils of generative AI. On the one hand, AI cancomplement human workers by increasing their productivity (Choudhury et al. 2020, Noy and Zhang 2023); on the other hand, it maysubstitute workers, leading to mass layo\u0000s and unemployment (Acemoglu and Autor 2011, Brynjolfsson et al. 2018a, Agrawal et al. 2019). Theintroduction of AI into organisations may also di\u0000erentially a\u0000ect workers of di\u0000erent abilities and expertise (Lebovitz et al. 2022, Allen andChoudhury 2022, Acemoglu et al. 2021). It may ultimately alter the composition of workers in the labour market by either exacerbating ormitigating wage inequality within and across occupations. https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/artificial-intelligence-and-its-short-term-effects-employment#:~:text=If anything%2C evidence suggests that,reduci… 2/6While a few current papers (e.g. Eleundou et al. 2023 and Felten et al. 2023) provide predictions on the future implications of generative AIon di\u0000erent tasks and occupations, the current e\u0000ects of generative AI have remained largely explored. It is crucial to understand short-term implications and predict long-term consequences of generative AI in human resources before addressing relevant concerns inincoming policies.Our studyIn our recent study (Hui et al. 2023), we provide empirical evidence on the short-term e\u0000ects of generative AI on employment. Speci\u0000cally,we investigate the introduction of ChaptGPT in November 2022, and the release of DALL- E 2 and Midjourney in April 2022. Our empiricalsetting is Upwork, one of the largest online labour markets in the world. Upwork is a great setting to study the short-term e\u0000ect due to the\u0000exibility of employment on the in this spot market, compared to the contractual rigidity of traditional labour markets.Using data from Upwork, we use a di\u0000erence-in-di\u0000erences research design to study the di\u0000erential change in employment outcomesbetween freelancers in occupations that are more heavily a\u0000ected by the introduction of generative AI and those in less a\u0000ectedoccupations. In the case of ChatGPT, we use writing-related jobs as the main a\u0000ected occupations, given previous research \u0000ndings inEleundou et al. (2023), anecdotal evidence, and the speci\u0000c attributes of ChatGPT as an LLM designed for text prediction and generation. Forimage-based AI models, the treatment group contains freelancers o\u0000ering services in design, images, and art.We \u0000nd that ChatGPT has a substantial adverse e\u0000ect on workersʼ employment outcomes. In writing-related occupations, freelancersexperience a decrease of 2% in the number of monthly jobs and a decrease of 5.2% in monthly earnings on the platform. Figure 2 visualisesthe di\u0000erence in employment outcomes (y-axis) from writing-based jobs and all others along with time (x-axis) a\u0000er controlling forfreelancer-level characteristics including past income level, number of jobs taken, and ratings from previous employers. This story is alsotrue for the extensive margin: freelancers are 1.2% less likely to receive any job in each month, and conditional on employment freelancerstake 4.7% less jobs.For image-based generative AI (namely, DALL – E2 and Midjourney), we observe qualitatively similar e\u0000ects in both the number of jobs (areduction of 2.1%) and total earnings (a reduction of 5.2%). The similar e\u0000ects obtained from the release of another generative AI at adi\u0000erent time and on another set of workers speaks to generalisability as well as the validity of our design.Figure 2 The e\u0000ect of text-based generative AI on freelancersʼ employment on the platformA) Monthly number of jobsB) Monthly revenue https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/artificial-intelligence-and-its-short-term-effects-employment#:~:text=If anything%2C evidence suggests that,reduci… 3/6The effect of worker qualityNext, we study whether the e\u0000ect on employment outcomes di\u0000ers by freelancersʼ quality. We use several measures of freelancers' quality,including their past employment and earnings, the skill level necessitated by past jobs, past performance, and hourly rate. We do not \u0000ndevidence that being high-quality moderates the adverse e\u0000ects of generative AI on a freelancer's employment outcomes across the board. Ifanything, evidence suggests that high-quality workers being disproportionately a\u0000ected by the release of generative AI models.These \u0000ndings suggest that generative AI models act as a substitute for workers of all quality types, reducing their employment andearnings. The heterogeneous treatment e\u0000ects are consistent with generative AI potentially reducing the productivity gap between low-quality and high-quality workers, leveling the playing \u0000eld across workers.Policy implicationsOur results have several implications for policymakers and managers. They suggest that employers are better positioned than workers tocapture the value generated by rapid AI advancement, as the new technology starts to replace human labour across the skills distribution. While in our paper we study the short-term e\u0000ects of generative AI, we speculate that the substitution between technological capital andlabour could be even more pronounced in the long run. Since we wrote the paper, there has been tremendous progress in generative AI (e.g.GPT 4.0) and many new innovations based on GPT. As the technology continues to evolve, it has the potential to further amplify thedynamics between labour and technology.ReferencesAcemoglu, D and D Autor (2011), \"Skills, tasks and technologies: Implications for employment and earnings,\" in Handbook of Labor Economics4:1043-1171.Acemoglu, D, D Autor, J Hazell and P Restrepo (2021), “AI and jobs: Evidence from US vacancies”, VoxEU.org, 3 March.Agrawal, A, J S Gans, and A Goldfarb (2019), \"Arti\u0000cial intelligence: the ambiguous labor market impact of automating prediction\", Journal ofEconomic Perspectives 33(2): 31-50.Allen, R, and P Choudhury (2022), \"Algorithm-augmented work and domain experience: The countervailing forces of ability and aversion,\"Organization Science 33(1): 149-169.Brynjolfsson, E, D Li, and L R Raymond (2023), \"Generative AI at work\", NBER Working Paper 31161.Charness, G, B Jabarian, and J List (2023), \"Scienti\u0000c Experimentation with Generative AI\", VoxEU.org, 16 October. https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/artificial-intelligence-and-its-short-term-effects-employment#:~:text=If anything%2C evidence suggests that,reduci… 4/6Choudhury, P, E Starr, and R Agarwal (2020), \"Machine learning and human capital complementarities: Experimental evidence on biasmitigation,\" Strategic Management Journal 41(8): 1381-1411.Eloundou, T, S Manning, P Mishkin, and D Rock (2023). \"Gpts are gpts: An early look at the labor market impact potential of large languagemodels\", arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.10130.Felten, E W, M Raj, and R Seamans (2023), \"Occupational heterogeneity in exposure to generative AI\", available at SSRN 4414065 .Hui, X, O Reshef, and L Zhou (2023), \"The Short-Term E\u0000ects of Generative Arti\u0000cial Intelligence on Employment: Evidence from an OnlineLabor Market\", available at SSRN 4527336.Lebovitz, S, N Levina, and H Lifshitz-Assaf (2021), \"Is AI Ground Truth Really True?
