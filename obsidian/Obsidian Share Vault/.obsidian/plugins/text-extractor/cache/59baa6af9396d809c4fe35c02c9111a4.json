Its key findings are: (1) MISO’s regional DAM energy prices increase with the day- ahead forecasts of natural gas price and MISO’s regional loads, PJM’s DAM energy price at its MISO interface, and MISO’s DAM AS requirements; (2) MISO’s regional DAM energy prices decline with DAM schedules for nuclear and wind generation; (3) MISO’s regional RTM energy prices increase with, but diverge from, MISO’s regional DAM energy prices; (4) MISO’s system-average DAM AS prices increase with MISO’s system-average DAM energy price and procured amounts of AS; and (5) MISO’s system-average RTM AS prices increase with MISO’s system-average RTM energy price and system-average DAM AS prices. These findings imply that MISO can reduce its DAM and RTM prices for energy and AS by accelerating wind generation development, expanding demand-side-management, and easing inter-regional transmission congestion. Introduction The world’s electricity supply systems are rapidly changing. Hydraulic fracturing has reduced natural gas prices and hence the operating costs of natural-gas-fired electricity generation [1]. The growth of solar and wind generation with negligible variable operating costs has reduced energy costs in wholesale electricity markets [2,3]. Lower wholesale energy prices have caused premature retirement of baseload power plants, raising concerns over resource adequacy and reliability of a bulk electric system [4]. Hence, an improved understanding of wholesale electricity price behavior can improve policy decisions that aim to reliably meet electricity demands at reasonable costs. Mirroring the global trend of electricity deregulation and restructuring [5,6], a regional transmission organization (RTO) in the U.S. is obligated to operate its electric grid reliably, perform transmission planning, and administer wholesale markets under an open access transmission tariff approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) [7]. Fig. 1 presents the seven RTOs in the U.S. that use day-ahead market (DAM) and real-time market (RTM) for energy and ancillary services (AS) to implement competitive wholesale trading to meet preset reliability standards at least cost [8,9]. A RTO’s energy prices are highly volatile with occasionally large spikes [10,11]. High and volatile wholesale energy prices spark extensive research in electricity derivatives and 1 7/27/24, 10:36 AM Determinants of the wholesale prices of energy and ancillary services in the U.S. Midcontinent electricity market - ScienceDirect https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544220301584?via%3Dihub 2/10 contracts, which are useful for risk management by a load serving entity [12,13]. Furthermore, large scale development of emissions-free renewable generation (e.g., solar and wind) for a clean and sustainable electricity future [14] tends to reduce these prices via the price reduction (aka merit order) effect, as exemplified by recent price regression studies in connection to CAISO, ERCOT and MISO [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]]. The U.S. RTOs have adopted various mechanisms to achieve administratively set reliability standards [[21], [22], [23]]. ERCOT relies on energy-only markets to date to provide generation investment incentive [24]. In contrast, MISO, CAISO and SPP establish resource adequacy requirements, while PJM, NYISO and ISO-NE utilize formal capacity markets to mitigate the “missing money” problem of inadequate investment incentive [22,23]. Hence, the design and operation of a RTO’s energy and AS markets have significant financial and reliability consequences [25], particularly for resources with fast-ramping capacity critical for a RTO’s reliable integration of intermittent solar and wind energy [26]. Motivated by the ongoing research on a RTO’s wholesale electricity price behavior, this paper uses a regression-based approach to analyze MISO’s hourly data for the 49-month period of December 2013 to December 2017, thereby documenting MISO’s wholesale electricity price behavior. Contrasting the single-equation approach used by Ref. [15], its system of 16 price regressions encompasses MISO’s five regional DAM energy prices and five regional RTM energy prices, three system-wide DAM AS prices, and three system-wide RTM AS prices. The paper’s key findings are as follows: • Corroborating the recent findings for CAISO [16] and ERCOT [19], MISO’s regional DAM energy prices tend to increase with the day-ahead (DA) forecasts of the fundamental drivers of natural gas price and regional loads, but tend to decline with MISO’s DAM generation schedules of regional nuclear and wind generation. These DAM price effects vary regionally, revealing MISO’s inter-regional transmission constraints. • Reflecting inter-RTO trading, MISO’s regional DAM energy prices tends to increase with PJM’s DAM energy price at its MISO interface, similar to the case of California and Pacific Northwest wholesale markets [18]. • Like recent findings for CAISO [20] and ERCOT [19], MISO’s regional RTM energy prices tend to increase with MISO’s regional DAM energy prices. Owing to the DA wind or load forecasts errors, as well as forced generation or transmission outages, RTM and DAM prices diverge, rejecting the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) in the electricity finance literature [12]. 2 3 7/27/24, 10:36 AM Determinants of the wholesale prices of energy and ancillary services in the U.S. Midcontinent electricity market - ScienceDirect https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544220301584?via%3Dihub 3/10 • Affirming recent findings for ERCOT [19], MISO’s system-average DAM AS prices tend to increase with MISO’s system-average DAM energy price and AS requirements. Further, MISO’s system-average RTM AS prices increase with MISO’s system-average RTM energy price and DAM AS prices. The above findings have two important implications. First, MISO’s energy and AS markets’ trading efficiency can be increased by improving regional loads’ or wind generation’s DA forecast accuracy, reducing inter-regional transmission congestion, enhancing coordination of inter-RTO interchange, and adopting virtual bidding products. Second, wind generation’s merit order effect permeates MISO’s DAM and RTM for energy and AS, potentially yielding bill savings for MISO’s electricity consumers. This paper makes the following main contributions. First, it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first comprehensive regression study of MISO’s regional DAM and RTM energy prices and system-average DAM and RTM AS prices. It generalizes the single-equation approach used by Ref. [15] to document the merit order effect of wind generation on MISO’s market prices. Moreover, it models price formation in various regions within the MISO, unlike [15] that treats MISO as a single market. Second, its regional differentiation generalizes the ERCOT analysis [19] of system-average DAM and RTM energy prices and DAM AS prices. Third, it investigates AS prices, unlike some recent studies that mainly focus on energy prices [[15], [16], [17], [18],20]. Fourth, it suggests qualitatively similar price behaviors across the RTOs in the U.S., albeit the vast differences in these RTOs’ geographical footprints, system load profiles, generation fuel mixes, and transmission configurations. Fifth, its regression-based approach is transparent, applicable to other wholesale electricity markets in the U.S. and elsewhere that have similar data availability. Sixth, its conclusion presents policy implications that are equally relevant to other RTOs in the U.S. and elsewhere. Finally, its empirics are useful in real-time applications by discerning how a change in wind generation, regional loads, or natural gas prices may affect wholesale market prices for energy and AS.

With adjusted R  ≥ 0.93, these regressions have a remarkably good fit with MISO’s noisy DAM energy price data. Nearly all coefficient estimates are significant. While four estimates have the wrong signs, they are statistically insignificant. Finally, all five regressions’ residuals are found to be stationary. Focusing on the individual coefficient estimates, a $1/MMBtu increase in the forecasted price of… Conclusion This paper applies a regression-based approach to a newly-developed sample of 35,327 hourly observations from 12/19/2013 to 12/30/2017 to document that MISO’s regional DAM energy prices increase with the DA forecasts of natural gas price, regional loads, required AS quantities, and PJM’s DAM energy price at its MISO interface. However, these DAM energy prices decrease with the DA forecasts of MISO’s regional nuclear and wind generation.
