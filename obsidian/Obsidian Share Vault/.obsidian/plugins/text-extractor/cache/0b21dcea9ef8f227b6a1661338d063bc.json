The particular focus of this paper is “as generated” demand, although other demands are defined. Other organisations such as Network Service Providers or Jurisdictional Planning Bodies (JPBs) might have a different definition for the same terms or associated terminology discussed in this paper. This paper does not delve into the differences. For definitional purposes, all references to “demand” in this paper equally apply to “consumption” 1. Structure of the paper The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 introduces the three types of demand based on where they are measured in the electricity network. It also discusses the three key demands of Native, Operational and Scheduled related to “as generated” demand as used in the NEM. Section 2 describes the “as generated” demand in the Electricity Market Management System (EMMS), by categorising them into their relevant electricity market processes. Assumptions The following assumptions are made for all demand definitions discussed in this paper. • All demand definitions are on a regional basis2. • All demands can be expressed as either actual or forecast, unless explicitly stated. • Scheduled loads mean normally-off scheduled loads3. There are currently no normally-on scheduled loads in the NEM. • If the NEM registration classification of a unit differs from its EMMS classification, this paper only discusses the unit’s EMMS classification4. Convention EMMS field names are italicised. All key demands that are used throughout the paper have been bolded. 1 For example, AEMO publications refer to both “operational demand” (electrical power, typically in MW) and “operational consumption” (electrical energy, typically in MWh), although the underlying compositional definition is the same. Refer to Operational Consumption and Demand document for more information on the differences between demand and consumption, at https://www.aemo.com.au/- /media/Files/Electricity/NEM/Planning_and_Forecasting/Demand-Forecasts/Operational-Consumption-definition.pdf. 2 Demand in a region that is met by generation within the region and the net interconnector imports into the region. 3 Normally-on and normally-off scheduled loads are defined in clause 3.8.7(i) and (j) of the National Electricity Rules (NER). Note Wholesale Demand Response is distinct from a normally-on scheduled load. 4 If a unit is registered as a non-scheduled generating unit but, as a condition of registration, the relevant Registered Participant must comply with some of the obligations of a Scheduled Generator, the unit may need to be treated as a scheduled generating unit in the central dispatch process. This paper refers to such a unit as a scheduled generating unit. For example, Yarwun is registered as a market non-scheduled generating unit but is dispatched as a scheduled generating unit with respect to its dispatch offers, targets and generation outputs. Accordingly, information about Yarwun is reported as scheduled generating unit information. © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 5 Contents Introduction 4 1.

Examples 26 Glossary 29 © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 6 1. What is demand? Demand is the electrical power requirement (in megawatts, or MW) of consumers in a region connected to the electricity network. As shown in Figure 1 below, based on the location of measurement in the electricity network, demand can be broadly classified into: • “As generated” demand. • “Sent out” demand. • “As consumed” demand. Figure 1 Electricity network topology “As consumed” demand or “customer demand” is measured at each customer’s connection point and represents the net electrical power consumed at that point. “As consumed” demand measures electricity power supplied to all customers (transmission and distribution) and therefore excludes generating unit auxiliary loads5 and transmission losses. “Sent out” demand is measured at each generating unit’s connection point and represents the net electrical power output from the generating unit excluding its auxiliary load. “Sent out” demand therefore comprises: • “As consumed” demand. • All electricity transmission losses incurred in delivering the net generating unit output to the bulk electricity customer connection points. “As generated” demand is measured at each generating unit’s terminal point and represents the gross electrical power output from the generating unit. “As generated” demand therefore comprises: 5 Load used to run a power station. This may include supplies to operate the coal mine as well. © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 7 • “Sent out” demand. • The electrical power supplied to all auxiliary loads required to operate the relevant generating unit at its “as generated” output. All demands discussed in this paper from this point are “As generated” demands. AEMO performs a number of functions and processes that require different types of generating units or loads to be included in the demand calculations. These functional and operational requirements have led AEMO to produce various types of demands defined by composition. In essence, there are three key demands. They are: • Native demand. • Operational demand. • Scheduled demand. Table 1 provides an overview of the composition of native demand, operational demand, and scheduled demand. • “Local generation” means power supplied from generators located in the relevant region. • “Imported generation” means the net power supplied to the relevant region at its inter-regional boundaries. • “Local scheduled loads” means power consumed by scheduled loads located in the relevant region. • “Wholesale Demand Response” (WDR) refers to the reduction in power consumed by dispatching a WDR unit. An X mark in Table 1 indicates the respective demand reduces when WDR is dispatched, while a tick mark indicates the WDR “response” is added back. Table 1 Native demand, operational demand and scheduled demand – composition Generation source Local generation Imported generation Local scheduled loads Wholesale Demand Response Key demands Scheduled and semi- scheduled generation Non-scheduled wind/solar generation Non-scheduled non-wind/non- solar generation Exempt generation Interconnector import including losses Generation < 30MW Generation ≥ 30MW Native demand ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓  ✓ Operational demand ✓  ✓   ✓  ✓ Scheduled demand ✓     ✓ ✓  The three key demands and the exceptions in calculating these demands are discussed in detail in the following sections. © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 8 1.1 Native demand Native demand in a region is demand that is met by local scheduled, semi-scheduled, non-scheduled 6, and exempt generation7, and by generation imports to the region, excluding the demand of local scheduled loads 8, and including Wholesale Demand Response. Native demand only includes generation for which AEMO and the JPBs receive sufficient information.9 Figure 2 below shows the composition of native demand. Figure 2 Native demand Where native demand is used Native demand is used as follows. The 10% and 50% POE seasonal maximum native demand forecasts are reported as part of the reliability assessment in Medium Term Projected Assessment of System Adequacy (MTPASA10). This is discussed in detail in Section 2.2.2. 1.2 Operational demand Operational demand in a region is demand that is met by local scheduled generation, semi-scheduled generation and non-scheduled wind/solar generation of aggregate capacity ≥ 30 MW, and by generation imports to the region, excluding the demand of local scheduled loads, and including Wholesale Demand Response. When Wholesale Demand Response (WDR) is dispatched the measurements of the other components of operational demand (measured operational demand11) will decrease by the amount of dispatched WDR. As the amount of dispatched WDR is determined by NEMDE Solver, the forecasts of operational demand need to reflect the expected demand before WDR is dispatched. To ensure consistency between forecasts of operational demand and historic values of operational demand it is necessary to reconstitute the measured operational demand with the estimated actual WDR. 6 This includes all non-scheduled generating units with aggregate capacity greater than 1 MW for which AEMO and JPBs have sufficient data. 7 Exempt generation refers to generation that is exempt from registration, under Chapter 2 of the NER and in accordance with the “Guide to NEM generator classification and exemption” issued by AEMO: https://aemo.com.au/en/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/participate-in-the- market/registration/exemption-from-registering-as-a-generator-in-the-nem. Typically, this includes generation with a capacity less than 5 MW, or less than 30 MW provided it exports less than 20 GWh in any 12-month period. 8 A market load classified in accordance to Chapter 2 of the NER as a scheduled load. A market customer submits dispatch bids in relation to scheduled loads. 9 Native demand does not include the demand met by behind-the-meter generation (e.g. rooftop PV, battery storage). Therefore, native demand reflects the impact of behind-the-meter generation (for example higher rooftop PV generation will result in lower midday native demand). 10 MTPASA has a daily resolution and forecasts two years ahead. It is a PASA process. 11 Measured operational demand is field “OPERATIONAL_DEMAND” in EMMS Data Model, as described in Appendix A2. Native Demand Wholesale Demand Response Local scheduled loads Local non- scheduled wind/solar generation < 30 mw + local non-scheduled non-wind/non- solar generation Exempt generation Local non- scheduled wind /solar generation ≥ 30 MW Interconnector import at regional boundary Local scheduled + semi-scheduled generation minus local scheduled loads © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 9 Operational demand differs from native demand in that it generally excludes demand met by non- scheduled wind/solar generation of aggregate capacity < 30 MW, non-scheduled non-wind/non-solar generation and exempt generation. The exceptions which are included in the operational demand definition are: • Yarwun (registered as non-scheduled generation but treated as scheduled generation in the EMMS). • Mortons Lane wind farm, Yaloak South wind farm, Hughenden solar farm, Longreach solar farm (non-scheduled generation < 30 MW but due to power system security reasons AEMO is required to model in network constraints). Figure 3 below shows the composition of operational demand. Wholesale Demand Response Actual operational demand includes the measured operational demand reconstituted with estimated actual WDR. The regional actual WDR is estimated either from SCADA telemetry (estimated response against a baseline) provided by each WDR unit, or from the previous interval dispatch target for WDR units with no telemetry. This aggregate WDR estimate is provided in a separate field to the measured operational demand through the EMMS data model (see Appendix A2 for operational demand data available). Operational demand adjustments From time to time, retroactive adjustments to actual operational demand may be required. These MW adjustments represent AEMO’s firmest estimate of counterfactual operational demand, using information available immediately after the event. Operational demand adjustments include: • Activated RERT; and • Involuntary load shedding that occurred as a result of a NER 4.8.9 instruction for load shedding from AEMO Operational demand adjustments exclude all other events, such as: • Other AEMO directions • Under Frequency Load Shedding • Operation of Special Protection Schemes • Virtual Power Plants / Demand Response (WDR is accounted for separately) • System Black • Industrial load outages Retroactive operational demand adjustments are provided in a separate field to the measured operational demand through the EMMS data model (see Appendix A2 for operational demand data available). Operational Demand Wholesale Demand Response Local scheduled loads Local non- scheduled wind/solar generation < 30 mw + local non-scheduled non-wind/non- solar generation Exempt generation Local non- scheduled wind /solar generation ≥ 30 MW Interconnector import at regional boundary Local scheduled + semi-scheduled generation minus local scheduled loads © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 10 Where operational demand is used Operational demand is used as follows. • For public reporting of electricity market and power system operation: for example, the minimum and maximum measured operational demand records reported to the media for reporting on market and power system incidents. • As a basis for calculating the forecast demand used in Pre-dispatch 12, Pre-dispatch Projected Assessment of System Adequacy (PDPASA13), Short Term Projected Assessment of System Adequacy (STPASA14) and Medium Term Projected Assessment of System Adequacy (MTPASA) processes (discussed in Section 2.1.2 under Total Demand in Pre-dispatch, Section 2.2.1 for PDPASA and STPASA and Section 2.2.2 for MTPASA). • Actual values of operational demand to a half-hourly resolution, are published on the AEMO website15 for all regions in the NEM (see Appendix A2 for operational demand data available). • AEMO publishes 10%, 50% and 90% probability of exceedance16 (POE) seasonal maximum17 operational demand forecasts for three probable scenarios for summer and winter over a 20-year timeframe for all NEM regions. These forecasts are used for Integrated System Plan18, Electricity Statement of Opportunities19 and Energy Adequacy Assessment Projection20. 1.3 Scheduled demand Scheduled demand in a region is demand that is met by local scheduled and semi-scheduled generation and by generation imports to the region. Scheduled demand differs from the other key demands in that it excludes the demand met by non-scheduled (wind/solar and non-wind/non-solar) generation and exempt generation and Wholesale Demand Response, and includes the demand of local scheduled loads. When Wholesale Demand Response is dispatched scheduled demand will decrease by the amount of dispatched WDR. The exceptions are Tumut 3 pumps (registered as non-scheduled loads but treated as scheduled loads in the EMMS) which are included. Figure 4 below shows the composition of scheduled demand. 12 Pre-dispatch has a 30-minute resolution and forecasts up to 40 hours ahead. It is a central dispatch process. 13 PDPASA has a 30-minute resolution and forecasts up to 40 hours ahead. It is a PASA process. 14 STPASA has a 30-minute resolution and forecasts eight days ahead. It is a PASA process. 15 Available under section “Operational Demand” at: https://www.aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data- nem/operational-demand-data. 16 The 10%, 50%, and 90% POE demands are defined in Appendix A1. 17 Maximum demand refers to the highest amount of electrical power delivered over a defined period (day, week, month, season or year). 18 Integrated System Plan (ISP) at: https://www.aemo.com.au/Electricity/National-Electricity-Market-NEM/Planning-and-forecasting/Integrated-System-Plan 19 NEM Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO) at: https://www.aemo.com.au/Electricity/National-Electricity-Market-NEM/Planning-and- forecasting/NEM-Electricity-Statement-of-Opportunities 20 Energy Adequacy Assessment Projection (EAAP) at: https://www.aemo.com.au/Electricity/National-Electricity-Market-NEM/Planning-and- forecasting/Energy-Adequacy-Assessment-Projection © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 11 Figure 4 Scheduled demand Where scheduled demand is used Scheduled demand is used as follows. As a basis for calculating the forecast demand used in the central dispatch process to determine regional prices and dispatch targets for scheduled and semi-scheduled generating units and Market Network Service Providers (MNSPs). Publication of scheduled demand values (InitialSupply and ClearedSupply) to the EMMS data model is discussed in Section 2.1.1.

Exceptions are Mortons Lane wind farm, Yaloak South wind farm, Hughenden solar farm, and Longreach solar farm, all of which are included in this group as significant non-scheduled generation. B. Non-scheduled (non-wind/non-solar or wind/solar <=30 MW) generation is not forecasted, and therefore not generally included. The exception is the DEMAND_AND_NONSCHEDGEN field in Dispatch and 5MPD, where the aggregate actual measured generation of those units (that provide telemetry to AEMO) is assumed to be constant and included in that field for those processes only. The DEMAND_AND_NONSCHEDGEN field is not used in the central dispatch process. © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 16 C. Wholesale Demand Response (WDR) units are normally-on loads that reduce consumption when dispatched. An X mark in this table indicates the respective demand reduces when WDR is dispatched, while a tick mark indicates the WDR “response” is added back. D. The MW losses incurred as a result of the flow across an interconnector can be proportionally allocated to the two regions connected by the interconnector using a pre-determined factor. This proportional allocation of the interconnector loss to a region is referred to as the region’s allocated interconnector loss. It signifies the losses on the interconnector between the region boundary and the Regional Reference Node (RRN). E. The package P5MIN contains data for 5MPD. F. The 5MPD solver determines forecast demand changes for each interval, by applying the relevant historical average percentage demand change profile to the previous dispatch run’s forecast total demand. G. OPERATIONAL_DEMAND field in DEMANDOPERATIONALACTUAL table is the measured operational demand, with WDR_ESTIMATE field not added back H. This row represents the sum of the OPERATIONAL_DEMAND field and WDR_ESTIMATE field. See Appendix A2 for more information on those fields. I. The table TRADINGREGIONSUM included data for trading intervals. Data in the trading interval tables are averages of the data in the six dispatch intervals of the relevant trading interval. The TRADINGREGIONSUM table stopped being populated from 1 October 2021, as stated in the EMMS Release Schedule and Technical Specification – 5MS Dispatch and Operations July 2019.

The main EMMS Data Model demand terms used in the central dispatch process are23: • Initial supply. • Cleared supply. • Total demand. Figure 5 below provides an overview of the composition and relationship between Initial Supply, Cleared Supply and Total Demand in Dispatch. Figure 5 Initial Supply, Cleared Supply and Total Demand For 5MPD and Pre-dispatch, the composition and relationship between Initial Supply, Cleared Supply and Total Demand are similar in principle to those in Dispatch. Initial Supply, Cleared Supply and Total Demand are discussed further in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2. The relationship of Dispatched Generation to Total Demand and Cleared Supply is discussed in Section 2.1.3 using a Regional Energy Balance Equation. 21 Dispatch has a five-minute resolution and it forecasts five minutes ahead. 22 5MPD has a five-minute resolution and it forecasts one hour ahead. 23 Table 2 also defines the demand term DEMAND_AND_NONSCHEDGEN, however it is not mentioned here as it is not used by the central dispatch process.

Initial Supply is actual scheduled demand measured or estimated at the beginning of an interval. Cleared Supply is forecast scheduled demand to be met at the end of the interval. Initial Supply is one of the inputs to the central dispatch process used to calculate Cleared Supply. EMMS Relationships The EMMS specific definitions for Initial Supply and Cleared Supply are given below. Initial Supply is the sum, at the start of each interval, of generation from all scheduled and semi-scheduled generating units within the region plus the net interconnector flow24 into the region (as measured at the inter-regional boundary25). Cleared Supply is the sum of the dispatch targets for all scheduled and semi-scheduled generating units within the region plus the net target interconnector flow26 into the region. The formulae for calculation of InitialSupply and ClearedSupply using the EMMS field names (italicised) are provided in Table 3. Table 3 Formula for InitialSupply and ClearedSupply EMMS Field Name Process Formula InitialSupply Dispatch, Pre-dispatch, 5MPD InitialSupply = Sum of InitialMW Over all Regional Scheduled and Semi-scheduled generating units + Net MeteredMWFlow into the Region Over all Interconnectors connected to the region ClearedSupply Dispatch, Pre-dispatch, 5MPD ClearedSupply = Sum of TotalCleared Over all Regional Scheduled and Semi-scheduled generating units + Net MWFlow into the Region Over all Interconnectors connected to the region In Dispatch, InitialMW and MeteredMWFlow are actual metered values (i.e. SCADA values). In Pre-dispatch and 5MPD, InitialMW and MeteredMWFlow are actual metered values only in the first interval and in subsequent intervals these values are based on the targets of the previous interval. To obtain the data required for calculating InitialSupply and ClearedSupply using the formulae provided in Table 3, refer to Appendix A3 for information on relevant tables and field names in the EMMS Data Model. Examples 1 and 2 in Appendix A4 compare manually calculated InitialSupply and ClearedSupply values using the formulae provided in Table 3 to the published values (calculated by the NEM systems) for a selected trading interval 27. 24 The net actual interconnector flow into the region, computed over all interconnectors connected to the region, is determined by deducting the exports out of the region from the imports into the region. 25 Interconnector flow as measured at inter-regional boundary = Interconnector flow at Regional Reference Node (RRN) + Allocated Interconnector Losses. 26 The net target interconnector flow into the region, computed over all interconnectors connected to the region, is determined by deducting the export targets out of the region from the import targets into the region. 27 The interval was chosen when a scheduled normally-off load was operating. © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 19 2.1.2 Total Demand Total Demand is the underlying forecast demand at the Regional Reference Node (RRN) that is met by local scheduled and semi-scheduled generation and interconnector imports, excluding the demand of local scheduled loads and the allocated interconnector losses but including the demand met by Wholesale Demand Response. Total Demand is calculated by the NEM Dispatch Engine (NEMDE) and is used as the launch point for the central dispatch process which performs the regional price calculations in Dispatch, Pre-dispatch and 5MPD, and determines dispatch targets for generating units. EMMS Relationships The EMMS specific definitions for Total Demand in Dispatch, Pre-dispatch, and 5MPD are discussed in this section. In Dispatch and the first interval of 5MPD, Total Demand is calculated by: • summing the actual generation values of all scheduled and semi-scheduled generating units within the region plus the net actual interconnector flow into the region • minus scheduled loads and allocated interconnector losses • plus actual 28 Wholesale Demand Response for all WDR units within the region • plus the DemandForecast 29 and AggregateDispatchError30. The actual values are obtained from Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) telemetry. For all subsequent intervals of 5MPD, the AggregateDispatchError (ADE) 28 is zero and the Total Demand is calculated by adding the forecast demand change31 to the Total Demand of the previous interval. In Pre-dispatch, Total Demand is computed from a 50% POE demand derived from a forecast operational demand calculated by AEMO’s demand forecasting system (discussed in Section 2.2.1). To calculate the 50% POE demand in Pre-dispatch, the demand met by significant non-scheduled wind/solar generation (generally ≥ 30 MW) is deducted from the forecast operational demand. This 50% POE demand is referred to as ResDemand in the EMMS Data Model. The ResDemand is adjusted to remove the allocated interconnector losses to determine the Total Demand at the Regional Reference Node (RRN). The formulae for calculation of Total Demand using EMMS field names is provided in Table 4. 28 In dispatch, the regional actual Wholesale Demand Response (WDR) is estimated either from SCADA telemetry (estimated response against a baseline) provided by each WDR unit, or from the previous dispatch target for WDR units with no telemetry. 29 The Demand Forecast is a 5-minute demand adjustment (Offset) that attempts to relate the demand at the beginning of a dispatch interval (Initial Supply) to the demand at the end (Cleared Supply) of the trading interval. From 1 October 2021 the National Electricity Amendment (Five Minute Settlement) Rule 2017 No.15, in conjunction with the National Electricity Amendment (Delayed implementation of five minute and global settlement) Rule 2020 No.10, changes the definition of a dispatch interval to a trading interval, but it will still be five minutes long. 30 Aggregate Dispatch Error is used by NEMDE to account for non-conformance (from dispatch targets) of dispatched generating units that are not enabled for Regulation Frequency Control. The ADE is determined from within the NEM Energy Management System (EMS) and is passed to NEMDE prior to each dispatch run. 31 The 5MPD solver determines forecast demand changes for each interval, by applying relevant historical average percentage demand change profile to the previous dispatch run’s forecast total demand. © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 20 Table 4 Formulae for TotalDemand EMMS Field Name Process Formula TotalDemand Dispatch TotalDemand = Sum of InitialMW Over all Regional Scheduled and Semi-scheduled generating units – Sum of InitialMW Over all Regional Scheduled Loads + Sum of InitialMW Over all Regional Wholesale Demand Response units + Net MeteredMWFlow into the Region Over all Interconnectors connected to the region – Total Allocated Interconnector Losses + DemandForecast + AggregateDispatchError (ADE) where: Allocated Interconnector Losses = Sum (MWLosses x FromRegionLossShare A) Over all Interconnectors connected to the region 5MPD Same as Dispatch for first interval, then: TotalDemand DI = TotalDemand DI-1 + DemandForecast DI Pre-dispatch TotalDemand = ResDemand – Allocated Interconnector Losses where: Allocated Interconnector Losses = Sum (MWLosses x FromRegionLossShare A) Over all Interconnectors connected to the region The components of ResDemand are provided in Table 2. A. FromRegionLossShare is a static factor (for each interconnector) that allocates the MW losses on the interconnector to the 2 regions that are connected by it. If the subject region is the notional FromRegion, FromRegionLossShare is used. If the subject region is the notional ToRegion, “1- FromRegionLossShare” should be used. For more information regarding the “Treatment of Loss Factors”, please refer to the document on AEMO’s website at: https://aemo.com.au/en/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market- nem/market-operations/loss-factors-and-regional-boundaries. To obtain the data required for calculating Total Demand using the formulae provided in Table 4, refer to Appendix A3 for information on relevant tables and field names in the EMMS Data Model. Example 3 in Appendix A4 compares manually calculated Total Demand value using the formulae provided in Table 4 to the published value (calculated by the NEM systems) for a selected trading interval. 2.1.3 Relationship between Dispatched Generation and EMMS Data Model terms in Regional Energy Balance Equation A Regional Energy Balance Equation describes the relationship between Dispatched Generation, Total Demand and Cleared Supply. The Regional Energy Balance Equation is used in the central dispatch process by the NEMDE to determine dispatch targets and regional prices. The Regional Energy Balance Equation holds true for all intervals in Dispatch, Pre-dispatch and 5MPD if sufficient generation is dispatched to meet the demand. The equation using the EMMS terms (italicised) is given below. DispatchableGeneration + Net Interconnector Targets (into the Region) = TotalDemand + DispatchableLoad – WDR_Dispatched + Allocated Interconnector Losses where: Net Interconnector Targets = Net MWFlow into the Region Over all Interconnectors connected to the region © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 21 Allocated Interconnector Losses = Sum of (MWLosses x FromRegionLossShare A) In the central dispatch process, the TotalDemand value is determined before the optimisation process and the values for the other variables are decided during the optimisation process. The right-hand-side (RHS) of the equation equates ClearedSupply, which is the forecast scheduled demand at the end of a trading interval. The left-hand side (LHS) of the equation shows the total generation dispatched, including interconnector imports, to meet that scheduled demand. To obtain the data required for the equation provided earlier, refer to Appendix A3 for information on the relevant tables and field names in the EMMS Data model. Example 4 in Appendix A4 illustrates the relationship between Supply (i.e. LHS of the equation) and Total Demand in the Regional Energy Balance Equation for a selected trading interval. 2.2 Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model used in PASA processes The PASA processes comprise Pre-dispatch PASA (PDPASA), Short term PASA (STPASA) and Medium term PASA (MTPASA). The EMMS Data Model terms used in PDPASA and STPASA are: • Demand10: a 10% POE demand (a high demand forecast), • Demand50: a 50% POE demand (an average demand forecast) and • Demand90: a 90% POE demand (a low demand forecast). Although Demand90 is published for PDPASA and STPASA, it is no longer used by the PDPASA and STPASA processes 32. For MTPASA, AEMO publishes Demand (POE 10), Demand (POE 50), NativeDemand (POE 10) and NativeDemand (POE 50). The process for determining the POE demands used in PDPASA and STPASA is described in Section 2.2.1 and for MTPASA is described in Section 2.2.2. 2.2.1 Forecast PDPASA and STPASA demands Process The POE demands used in PDPASA and STPASA are derived from a forecast operational demand, determined by AEMO’s Demand Forecasting System (DFS) and the Australian Wind Energy Forecasting System (AWEFS)/ Australian Solar Energy Forecasting System (ASEFS). These POE demands are determined by deducting the demand component met by significant non-scheduled wind/solar generation (obtained from AWEFS/ASEFS forecasts33) from the forecast operational demand. The composition of the POE demands for the PDPASA and STPASA processes is shown in Figure 6. 32 AEMO is required to publish a 90% POE demand for STPASA under the NER. 33 AWEFS/ASEFS provide outputs of wind/solar farm generation forecasts for multiple timeframes (Short Term and Pre-dispatch). Each of these timeframes use different inputs and prediction models to provide forecast outputs. © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 22 Figure 6 10%, 50%, and 90% POE demands in PDPASA and STPASA 2.2.2 Forecast MTPASA Demands Process MTPASA uses 10% and 50% POE operational demand forecasts for modelling. 10% and 50% POE native demand forecasts are also reported as part of the MTPASA process. The MTPASA process is detailed in the MTPASA Process Description34. The composition of the POE demands used in the MTPASA process is shown in Figure 7 below.

Probability of exceedance demands The probability of exceedance (POE) demand is the probability or the likelihood the forecast would be met or exceeded. The three main types of POE demands are: • 10% POE Demand. • 50% POE Demand. • 90% POE Demand. They are used in the various processes within AEMO to determine a realistic range of power system and market outcomes. 50% POE demand A 50% probability of exceedance (POE) demand, also known as Demand50, implies there is a 50% probability of the forecast being met or exceeded. 10% POE demand The 10% probability of exceedance (POE) demand is the value that 10% of the actual demand values are expected to be above and 90% of the actual demand values are expected to be below. 90% POE demand The 90% probability of exceedance (POE) demand is the value that 90% of the actual demand values are expected to be above and 10% of the actual demand values are expected to be below. © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 24 A2.

Examples The EMMS terms and formulae introduced in Section 2.1 are explained using a selected trading interval below. The selected interval is the trading interval ending 0310 hrs on 11 July 2010 and the selected region is NSW. This particular trading interval and region were selected because the amount of the scheduled load dispatched in NSW was non-zero for the interval. The relevant EMMS data for the selected trading interval is provided in Table 8. Table 8 EMMS Data for Trading Interval ending 0310 hrs on 11 July 2010 EMMS Field Names EMMS recorded values EMMS Field Names EMMS recorded values MeteredMWFlow (QNI) -1002.84 InitialMW (Generation) 5339.73 MeteredMWFlow (Terranora) -136.19 TotalCleared (Loads) 195 MeteredMWFlow (VIC-NSW) 612.64 TotalCleared (Generation) 5309.32 MWLosses (QNI) 57.95 TotalDemand 6801.76 MWLosses (Terranora) 3.5 DemandForecast -22.51 MWLosses (VIC-NSW) 28.12 DispatchableGeneration 5309.32 MWFlow (QNI) -983.61 NetInterchange -1687.44 MWFlow (Terranora) -137 ClearedSupply 7041.37 MWFlow (VIC-NSW) 611.44 InitialSupply 7091.41 InitialMW (Loads) 221.26 AggregateDispatchError (ADE) 0 WDR_InitialMW 0 WDR_Dispatched 0 Examples 1, 2, and 3 below demonstrate how InitialSupply, ClearedSupply, and TotalDemand can be achieved using the formulae provided in Section 2.1. The manually calculated values using the formulae are then compared against the system calculated values, which are published to the EMMS Data Model. Example 4 demonstrates that the regional energy balance equation holds true for the selected trading interval. Example 1 The table below provides the published EMMS data (refer to Table 8) and manually calculated values for Initial Supply using the formula in Section 2.1. Date Published EMMS Data Manually Calculated Data Initial Supply Metered MW Flow (QNI) Metered MW Flow (Terranora) Metered MW Flow (VIC-NSW) Net Initial MW (EMMS data summated) Net Import to NSW (EMMS data summated) Initial Supply (from the formula) 11/07/2010 03:10 7091.41 -1002.84 A -136.19 612.64 5339.73 1751.67 B 7091.40 A. A flow of -1002.84 MW on NSW1-QLD1 means an import of +1002.84 MW into NSW on that interconnector. The +ve or –ve sign represents the direction of flow on the interconnector with northerly flow being +ve and southerly flow being –ve. © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 27 B. Net Import into NSW = +1002.84 (NSW1-QLD1) + 136.19 (N-Q-MNSP1) + 612.64 (VIC1-NSW1) = 1751.67 MW. The Net InitialMW value was determined by summing the individual generating unit InitialMW (SCADA) values for all scheduled and semi-scheduled generators in NSW. Net Import into NSW was calculated by extracting the MeteredMWFlow (SCADA) values for QNI (NSW1-QLD1), Terranora (N-Q-MNSP1) and Victoria to NSW (VIC1-NSW1) Interconnectors and subtracting the exports out of the region from imports into the region. A minor discrepancy between the dispatch value and calculated value exists possibly due to rounding errors. Example 2: Cleared Supply in Dispatch The table below provides the published EMMS data (refer to Table 8) and manually calculated values for Cleared Supply using the formula in Section 2.1. Date Published EMMS Data Manually Calculated Data Cleared Supply Net Total Cleared (Total Dispatch targets) MW Flow (NSW-QLD) MW Flow (Terranora) MW Flow (VIC-NSW) Net Import Target into NSW (EMMS data summated) Cleared Supply (from the formula) 11/07/2010 03:10 7041.37 5309.32 -983.61 A -137.00 611.44 1732.05 B 7041.37 A. A flow of -983.61 MW on NSW1-QLD1 is the same as an import of +983.61 MW into NSW on that interconnector. B. Net Import into NSW = +983.61 (NSW1-QLD1) + 137 (N-Q-MNSP1) + 611.44 (VIC1-NSW1) = 1732.05 MW. The Net TotalCleared value is the same as the published DispatchableGeneration value in the EMMS Data Model. This value can also be determined by summing the individual generating unit dispatch targets (i.e. TotalCleared) for all scheduled and semi-scheduled generators in NSW. Net Import Target into NSW is calculated by extracting the MWFlow values for QNI (NSW1-QLD1), Terranora (N-Q-MNSP1) and Victoria to NSW (VIC1-NSW1) Interconnectors and subtracting the exports out of the region from imports into the region. Example 3: Total Demand in Dispatch The table below provides the published EMMS data (refer to Table 8) and manually calculated values for Total Demand using the formula in Section 2.1. Date Published EMMS Data Manually Calculated Data Total Demand WDR_ InitialMW Demand Forecast ADE Net Load Initial MW (EMMS data summated) Net Generation Initial MW (EMMS data summated) Net Allocation Interconnector Losses (EMMS data calculated) Net Import into NSW (EMMS data) Total Demand (from the formula) 11/07/2010 03:10 6801.76 0 -22.51 0 221.26 5339.73 44.61 A 1750 6801.35 A. Net Interconnector Loss allocated to NSW = 3.5 (MW Loss on N-Q-MNSP) * 0.65 (Loss Factor Allocation to NSW on N-Q-MNSP) + 57.95 (MW Loss on NSW-QLD) * 0.42 (Loss Factor Allocation to NSW on NSW-QLD)+ 28.12 (MW Loss on VIC-NSW) * 0.64 (Loss Factor Allocation to NSW on VIC-NSW). The Net Generation InitialMW value is determined by summing the individual generating unit InitialMW values for all scheduled and semi-scheduled generators in the NSW region. The Net Load InitialMW value is determined by summing the individual scheduled load InitialMW values. The interconnector flow values © AEMO 2021 | Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model 28 (MeteredMWFlow) are extracted for QNI (NSW1-QLD1), Terranora (N-Q-MNSP1) and Victoria to NSW (VIC1- NSW1) Interconnectors and net import calculated by subtracting the exports out of the region from imports into the region. The discrepancy between the manually calculated Total Demand value and the dispatch value (determined by NEMDE) is due to a subtlety involving the interconnector loss calculated. The TotalCleared interconnector losses (from which the Allocated Interconnector Losses are determined) are calculated from interconnector target flow instead of InitialMW flow. The latter of these values is not reported by NEMDE. As NEMDE actually uses the estimated losses at the beginning of the trading interval to determine Total Demand, the manual calculation is only an approximation of the NEMDE calculation, and is a source of some of the result discrepancy. Example 4: Regional Energy Balance Equation in Dispatch The Regional Energy Balance Equation is provided below. The RHS of the equation equates ClearedSupply. DispatchableGeneration + Net Interconnector Targets (into the Region) = TotalDemand + DispatchableLoad - WDR_Dispatched + Allocated Interconnector Losses The Regional Energy Balance in the NSW region for the selected trading interval is shown below.
