However, in many real-world situations, the data distributions are not stationary and they can change over time while reducing the accuracy of the forecasting models, which in the ML literature is known as concept drift. Handling concept drift in forecasting is essential for many ML methods in use nowadays, however, the prior work only proposes methods to handle concept drift in the classiﬁcation domain. To ﬁll this gap, we explore concept drift handling methods in particular for Global Forecasting Models (GFM) which recently have gained popularity in the forecasting domain. We propose two new concept drift handling methods, namely: Error Con- tribution Weighting (ECW) and Gradient Descent Weighting (GDW), based on a continuous adaptive weighting concept. These methods use two forecasting models which are separately trained with the most recent series and all series, and ﬁnally, the weighted average of the forecasts provided by the two models are considered as the ﬁnal forecasts.

The forecasting models are typically trained based on historical data. In most applications, data distributions are not stationary and they change over time while making the trained models outdated and reducing their forecasting accuracy, which is known as concept drift. Hence, it is important to make sure that the trained models well-generalise beyond the training data and are capable to provide accurate forecasts even with the changed data distributions. Transfer learning can be applied to make the models robust to distribution shift. In general, transfer learning is an approach of solving one problem and applying the corresponding knowledge gained to solve another related problem. In the time series forecasting domain, the transfer learning models typically train on a large set of series and during forecasting, they predict the future of (1) new series that they have not seen before; (2) training series where the data distributions change over time. In this chapter, we focus on the second sub-problem of transfer learning which is predicting the future of a set of series that is used to train a model when the corresponding data distribution is not stationary. Traditional forecasting methods like Exponential Smoothing [ETS, 1] are capable of handling the most common non-stationarities, namely trends and seasonalities, and also have been designed to show a certain degree of robustness under other types of non-stationarities. In particular, ETS gives most weight to the most recent observations and therefore it can adapt to a distribution shift reasonably well. How- ever, Global Forecasting Models [GFM, 2] have recently shown their potential in providing more accurate forecasts compared to the traditional univariate forecasting models, by winning the M4 [3] and M5 [4] forecasting competitions. In contrast to traditional univariate forecasting models that build isolated models on each series, GFMs build a single model across many series while allowing the model to learn the cross-series information. By building a single model over many series, the models have more data available for training and can aﬀord to be more complex [5]. Conse- quently, ML methods like neural networks and Gradient Boosted Trees are usually the methods of choice for global modelling. However, unlike many traditional fore- casting methods like ETS, ML methods do normally not have inherent mechanisms to deal with changes in the underlying distribution. Therefore, in ML the ﬁeld of concept drift has emerged, which studies how ML methods can be used under dis- tribution shift [6]. In this chapter, we study how the methods from the concept drift literature can be used for forecasting with ML methods. To the best of our knowledge, no methods to deal with concept drift in the forecasting domain in a GFM and ML context have been proposed in the literature. The available concept drift handling methods are all related to the classiﬁcation Handling Concept Drift in Global Time Series Forecasting 3 domain. Dynamic Weighted Majority [DWM, 7], Social Adaptive Ensemble [SAE, 8] and Error Interaction Approach [EIA, 9] are some of the popular concept drift handling methods in the classiﬁcation domain. Most of these concept drift handling methods use ensembling [10]. In the forecasting space, ensembling is also known as forecast combination which aggregates the predictions of multiple forecasting models to produce the ﬁnal forecasts. Ensembling techniques are widely used to reduce model variance and model bias. This motivates us to explore methods to handle concept drift in the GFM space that incorporate ensembling techniques. In this study, we propose two new forecast combination methods to handle the concept drift in the forecasting domain. We name these two methods Error Contribu- tion Weighting (ECW) and Gradient Descent Weighting (GDW). In particular, these methods independently train two forecasting models based on diﬀerent time series, typically one model is trained with the most recent series history and the other model is trained with the full series history, where the two models are ﬁnally weighted based on the previous prediction error, which is known as continuous adaptive weighting. The proposed ECW and GDW methods are diﬀerent based on the method of cal- culation of the sub-model weights. In the proposed methods, the sub-model trained with the full series’ history is expected to provide more accurate forecasts in gen- eral situations whereas if concept drift occurs, then the sub-model trained with the most recent series’ history is expected to quickly adapt to the new concept. Further- more, two diﬀerent methods for series weighting, exponential weighting and linear weighting, are used during the training of the two sub-models where these methods internally assign higher weights for the most recent series observations than the older observations during training. We also quantify the eﬀect of handling concept drift using our proposed methods and only using the series weighted methods con- sidering LightGBM [11] as the base learner. The LightGBM models that use our proposed concept drift handling methods outperform a set of statistical benchmarks and LightGBM baselines with statistical signiﬁcance across three simulated datasets on four error metrics. All implementations of this study are publicly available at: https://github.com/Neal-Liu-Ziyi/Concept_Drift_Handling. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces diﬀer- ent concept drift types. Section 3 reviews the relevant prior work. Section 4 explains the series weighted methods and proposed concept drift handling methods in detail. Section 5 explains the experimental framework, including the datasets, error metrics, benchmarks, evaluation and statistical testing. An analysis of the results is presented in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the study and discusses possible future research. 2 Problem Statement: Concept Drift Types There are two main types of concept drift: real concept drift [7] and virtual concept drift [12]. Real concept drift occurs when the true outputs of the instances change over time whereas virtual concept drift occurs when the data distribution changes 4 Ziyi Liu, Rakshitha Godahewa, Kasun Bandara and Christoph Bergmeir over time even with the same true outputs, possibly due to noise. In many situations, real and virtual concept drift can co-occur. The literature typically classiﬁes real concept drift into four diﬀerent groups [6] which are (1) sudden concept drift where the data distribution at time 𝑡 suddenly changes into a new distribution at time 𝑡 + 1; (2) incremental concept drift where the data distribution changes and stays in a new distribution after going through a variable distribution; (3) gradual concept drift where the data distribution shifts between a new distribution and the current distribution over time where gradually, the series completely enters the new distribution; (4) recurring concept drift where the same concept drift occurs periodically. Incremental and recurring concept drift in a time series forecasting context are closely related to trends and seasonalities in the data. In particular, recurring concept drift can be easily handled by the typical handling of seasonality with dummy variables, Fourier terms and similar additional features [13]. Thus, in this study we focus on three concept drift types: sudden, incremental and gradual, which are illustrated in Figure 1. Fig. 1: A visualisation of sudden, gradual and incremental concept drift types. 3 Related Work In the following, we discuss the related prior work in the areas of global time series forecasting, transfer learning and concept drift handling. Handling Concept Drift in Global Time Series Forecasting 5 3.1 Global Time Series Forecasting GFMs [2] build a single model across many series with a set of global parameters that are the same across all series. In contrast to the traditional univariate forecasting models, GFMs are capable of learning cross-series information with a fewer amount of parameters. Global models have been pioneered by works such as Salinas et al. [14], Smyl [15], Bandara et al. [16], Hewamalage et al. [17], Godahewa et al. [18]. GFMs have recently obtained massive popularity in the forecasting ﬁeld after winning the M4 [3] and M5 [4] forecasting competitions. In particular, the winning method of the M4 competition uses global Recurrent Neural Networks [RNN, 17] whereas the winning method of the M5 competition uses global LightGBM [11] models. 3.2 Transfer Learning In the forecasting domain, there are many works that present on forecasting new time series that a model has not seen during training. Oreshkin et al. [19] propose a deep learning based meta-learning framework that generalises well on new time series from diﬀerent datasets that it has not seen before. The popular Nixtla framework [20] provides ten N-BEATS [21] and N-HiTS [22] models that are pre-trained using the M4 dataset [3] where the models are expected to generalise on unseen time series. Woo et al. [23] propose DeepTime, a meta-learning framework that can forecast unseen time series by properly addressing distribution shifts using a ridge regressor. Grazzi et al. [24] propose Meta-GLAR, which performs transfer learning using local closed-form adaptation updates. The transfer learning framework proposed by Ye and Dai [25] in particular considers the adequate long-ago data during training. To the best of our knowledge, all these transfer learning frameworks produce forecasts for unseen time series. In contrast, our proposed methods produce forecasts for the same set of time series used during training where the distribution of the series is not stationary. 3.3 Concept Drift Handling To the best of our knowledge, the existing concept drift handling methods are all related to the classiﬁcation domain. The concept drift handling methods in the literature can be mainly divided into two categories: implicit methods and explicit methods [26]. The explicit methods use a drift detection technique and immediately react to the drift at the point of its occurrence. The implicit methods do not use drift detection techniques. In particular, Chu and Zaniolo [27] propose the Adaptive Boosting Model which is an explicit method of concept drift handling in the classiﬁcation domain. This 6 Ziyi Liu, Rakshitha Godahewa, Kasun Bandara and Christoph Bergmeir method assigns a weight to each training instance where the weights are consequently updated across a sequence of classiﬁers. The ﬁrst classiﬁer assigns a sample weight to each instance. Each classiﬁer then keeps the same weights for the correctly classiﬁed instances and assigns higher weights for the incorrectly classiﬁed instances where the weighted instances are used to train the next classiﬁer in the sequence. Each classiﬁer is also assigned a separate weight based on its classiﬁcation accuracy. This process is repeated until the error function does not change. The weighted average of the predictions provided by all classiﬁers are considered as the ﬁnal prediction. When a concept drift situation is detected, the weight of each classiﬁer in the sequence is reset to one. However, this method contains a few limitations. It is highly time-consuming for trivial concept drift. Also, if the concept drift is too small to impact the accuracy of the previous classiﬁer, it may stop building new classiﬁers. Furthermore, it needs to reset all classiﬁers when a data stream encounters concept drift which may then lead the model to be sensitive to false alarms [28]. The recurring concept drift framework, RCD, proposed by Gonçalves Jr and De Barros [29] also uses an explicit approach to handle concept drift. This method extends a similar approach proposed by Widmer and Kubat [30] that was originally designed to deal with categorical data, to work with numerical data. It stores the context of each data type in a buﬀer and a classiﬁer is built together with a concept drift detector. This method uses a two step drift detection mechanism. The drift detector uses a new classiﬁer to detect concept drift. If there is no concept drift, an empty buﬀer is ﬁlled with the samples used in the training of the classiﬁer. Furthermore, there is a warning level to monitor the error rate of the classiﬁer where if the error rate of the classiﬁer reaches the warning level, it means concept drift might be occurring. Simultaneously, a new classiﬁer is created with the new buﬀer. If the error rate of this classiﬁer decreases and returns to the normal level, then the algorithm will treat that concept drift as a false alarm. Furthermore, when a true concept drift occurs, a statistical test compares the current buﬀer with all previous buﬀers to detect whether the new concept has already been observed in the past. If the test result is positive, which means the new concept has been seen before, then the previous classiﬁer and the buﬀer corresponding to this concept are used. Otherwise, the current classiﬁer and the buﬀer are stored in the list. The main limitation of these explicit methods is that they frequently falsely detect concept drift. Therefore, using these explicit methods may result in incorrect concept drift detection while reducing the model performance. Furthermore, it is diﬃcult to use a drift detector to recognise diﬀerent concept drift types. Thus, implicit methods are usually more useful in handling concept drift. The DWM method proposed by Kolter and Maloof [7] is an implicit method of handling concept drift. This method uses a four-step process to handle concept drift: (1) the DWM holds a weighted pool of base learners which adds or removes base learners based on the performance of the global algorithm; (2) if the global algorithm makes a mistake, then an expert will be added; (3) if a base learner makes a mistake, then its weight will be reduced; (4) if the weight of a base learner reduces below a threshold, then it will be removed. The SAE method proposed by Gomes and Enembreck [8] is also a popular implicit method which is also known as the Handling Concept Drift in Global Time Series Forecasting 7 social network abstraction for data stream classiﬁcation. It uses a similar learning strategy as the DWM method. The SAE method explores the similarities between its classiﬁers. It also drops classiﬁers based on their accuracy and similarities with other classiﬁers. The new classiﬁers are only added if the overall method accuracy is lower than a given threshold. Furthermore, SAE connects two classiﬁers when they have very similar predictions. Even though implicit methods overcome the issues of explicit methods such as the model sensitivity to falsely detecting concept drift and diﬃculties in recognising diﬀerent concept drift types, they take a considerable amount of time to adapt to a new concept. This phenomenon has motivated researchers to explore robust and rapidly reactive concept drift handling methods without drift detection. The EIA method proposed by Baier et al. [9] is an implicit method that does not use drift detection. The EIA uses two models with diﬀerent complexities, 𝑀𝑠𝑖𝑚 𝑝𝑙𝑒 and 𝑀𝑐𝑜𝑚 𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥, to make predictions. At a time, the predictions are obtained using a single model where this model is selected based on its error predicted using a regression method. Here, 𝑀𝑐𝑜𝑚 𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥 captures more information during model training and thus, in normal situations, 𝑀𝑐𝑜𝑚 𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥 is used to make predictions. However, when the data has concept drift, in particular sudden concept drift, 𝑀𝑐𝑜𝑚 𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥 is unable to respond to the concept drift quickly. Thus, in such situations, 𝑀𝑠𝑖𝑚 𝑝𝑙𝑒 which is trained with most recent observations is applied as it can quickly adapt to the current concept. However, the EIA method is only applicable to sudden concept drift as it is diﬃcult to switch between the two models more frequently to handle continuous drift types such as incremental and gradual concept drift types. In line with that, in this study, we propose two methods which use the continuous adaptive weighting approach, ECW and GDW, where both methods are inspired by the EIA method. Similar to the EIA, our proposed methods use two sub-models. However, unlike the EIA method, the weighted average of the forecasts provided by both sub-models is considered during forecasting where the weights of the sub- models are dynamically changed. Furthermore, all the above explained concept drift handling work is from the classiﬁcation domain where in this study, we explore the elements of these methods that should be changed to adapt them to handle concept drift in the forecasting domain. 4 Methodology This section explains the series weighted methods and our proposed concept drift handling methods in detail. 8 Ziyi Liu, Rakshitha Godahewa, Kasun Bandara and Christoph Bergmeir 4.1 Series Weighted Methods In this simple and straightforward ﬁrst approach, we assign diﬀerent weights for the training instances. In particular, we consider the most recent instances to be more relevant than older instances and thus, during training, we assign higher weights for the most recent instances where the weights are gradually decreased for the older instances, e.g., using an exponential decay similar to ETS. In our work, we consider two series weighting methods: exponential weighting and linear weighting. Equations 1 and 2 respectively deﬁne the process of weighting the training instances and the method of calculating the weights with exponential and linear weighting methods. Here, 𝑥𝑖 is the original 𝑖𝑡 ℎ instance, 𝑋𝑖 is the weighted 𝑖𝑡 ℎ instance, series_length is the number of training instances considered from a particular series, 𝛼series_length−𝑖 is the weight of the 𝑖𝑡 ℎ instance, 𝛼0 is the initial weight of the most recent instance, where 0 < 𝛼 ≤ 1, and 𝛽 is the weight decrease of the linear weighting, where 0 < 𝛽 ≤ 1. 𝑋𝑖 = 𝛼series_length−𝑖 · 𝑥𝑖 (1) 𝛼𝑖 = {𝛼𝑖−1 · 𝛼0 exponential weighting 𝛼𝑖−1 − 𝛽 series_length linear weighting (2) The experiments are conducted considering two values for series_length, 200 instances and all instances. The values of 𝛼0 and 𝛽 are ﬁxed to 0.9 based on our preliminary experiments. Finally, four models are trained with each of our experi- mental datasets (Section 5.1), considering the two weighting methods: exponential and linear weighting, and two series_length values. 4.2 Our Proposed Concept Drift Handling Methods We propose two continuous adaptive weighting methods: ECW and GDW. In par- ticular, our methods train two forecasting models with diﬀerent series where one model is trained with the recent series observations (𝑀partial) and the other model is trained with all series observations (𝑀all). The weighted average of the predictions provided by 𝑀partial and 𝑀all is considered as the ﬁnal prediction of a given time point where the weights of these models are dynamically changed and calculated based on the previous prediction error. As 𝑀partial is trained with the recent data, its prediction accuracy may be less than the prediction accuracy of 𝑀all, however, if the series encounters concept drift, then 𝑀partial can quickly adapt to the new concept compared to 𝑀all. In general, the weight of 𝑀partial is less than the weight of 𝑀all due to its lower prediction accuracy. However, when a concept drift occurs, our methods rapidly increase the weight of 𝑀partial which can eﬃciently remedy the issues of other implicit concept drift handling methods. Handling Concept Drift in Global Time Series Forecasting 9 We consider Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) as the loss function of 𝑀partial and 𝑀all. Equation 3 deﬁnes RSS where 𝑦𝑖 are the actual values, ˆ𝑦𝑖 are the predictions and 𝑛 is the number of predictions. 𝑅𝑆𝑆 = 𝑛∑︁ 𝑖=1 (𝑦𝑖 − ˆ𝑦𝑖)2 (3) As we only consider the error of the last prediction for the weight calculations corresponding with the next prediction, Equation 3 can be reduced to: 𝑅𝑆𝑆𝑖 = (𝑦𝑖 − ˆ𝑦𝑖)2 (4) Based on preliminary experiments and to manage complexity of the experiments, we consider 200 time series observations when training the 𝑀partial model. Our proposed ECW and GDW methods are diﬀerent based on the algorithms they use to calculate the weights of 𝑀partial and 𝑀all, which we explain in detail in the next sections. 4.2.1 Error Contribution Weighting The ECW method directly outputs the prediction of 𝑀all as the ﬁrst prediction. From the second prediction onwards, it determines the weights that should be used to combine the predictions of the two sub-models as follows. The prediction errors of 𝑀partial and 𝑀all for the 𝑖𝑡 ℎ prediction, 𝜖 𝑝𝑖 and 𝜖𝑎𝑖 , are deﬁned as shown in Equations 5 and 6, respectively, considering RSS as the loss function. 𝜖 𝑝𝑖 = (𝑦𝑖 − ˆ𝑦partial𝑖 )2 (5) 𝜖𝑎𝑖 = (𝑦𝑖 − ˆ𝑦all𝑖 )2 (6) The error percentages of 𝑀partial and 𝑀all for the 𝑖𝑡 ℎ prediction, 𝐸 𝑝𝑖 and 𝐸𝑎𝑖 , are deﬁned as shown in Equations 7 and 8, respectively. 𝐸 𝑝𝑖 = 𝜖 𝑝𝑖 𝜖 𝑝𝑖 + 𝜖𝑎𝑖 (7) 𝐸𝑎𝑖 = 𝜖𝑎𝑖 𝜖 𝑝𝑖 + 𝜖𝑎𝑖 (8) The weights corresponding with 𝑀partial and 𝑀all for the 𝑖𝑡 ℎ prediction, 𝑤 𝑝𝑖 and 𝑤𝑎𝑖 , can be then deﬁned as shown in Equations 9 and 10, respectively. In this way, the higher weight is assigned to the model with the lowest previous prediction error. 𝑤 𝑝𝑖 = 𝐸𝑎𝑖−1 (9) 10 Ziyi Liu, Rakshitha Godahewa, Kasun Bandara and Christoph Bergmeir 𝑤𝑎𝑖 = 𝐸 𝑝𝑖−1 (10) Equation 11 shows the formula used to obtain the ﬁnal prediction corresponding with the 𝑖𝑡 ℎ time point, ˆ𝑦𝑖, after weighting. ˆ𝑦𝑖 = 𝑤 𝑝𝑖 · ˆ𝑦 𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑖 + 𝑤𝑎𝑖 · ˆ𝑦𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖 (11) Algorithm 1 shows the process of the ECW method that is used to obtain the prediction for a given time point. Algorithm 1 Error Contribution Weighting 1: procedure ecw(𝑦𝑖−1, ˆ𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑖−1 , ˆ𝑦𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖−1 , ˆ𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑖 , ˆ𝑦𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖 , 𝑖) 2: if 𝑖 is 1 then 3: 𝑦𝑖 ← ˆ𝑦𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖 4: else 5: 𝜖𝑎𝑖−1 ← 𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒_𝑟 𝑠𝑠 ( 𝑦𝑖−1, ˆ𝑦𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖−1 ) 6: 𝜖 𝑝𝑖−1 ← 𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒_𝑟 𝑠𝑠 ( 𝑦𝑖−1, ˆ𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑖−1 ) 7: 𝑤𝑎𝑖 ← 𝜖 𝑝𝑖−1 𝜖 𝑝𝑖−1 +𝜖𝑎𝑖−1 8: 𝑤𝑝𝑖 ← 𝜖𝑎𝑖−1 𝜖 𝑝𝑖−1 +𝜖𝑎𝑖−1 9: 𝑦𝑖 ← 𝑤𝑝𝑖 · ˆ𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑖 + 𝑤𝑎𝑖 · ˆ𝑦𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖 10: end if 11: return 𝑦𝑖 12: end procedure 4.2.2 Gradient Descent Weighting The GDW method uses gradient descent to determine the weights of the sub-models. The sub-models are initialised with weights of 0.5. This method also directly outputs the prediction of 𝑀all as the ﬁrst prediction. From the second prediction onwards, it determines the weights that should be used to combine the predictions of the two sub-models using gradient descent as follows. The ﬁnal error of the 𝑖𝑡 ℎ prediction, 𝜖𝑖, is deﬁned as shown in Equation 12 considering RSS as the loss function. 𝜖𝑖 = (𝑦𝑖 − 𝑤 𝑝𝑖 · ˆ𝑦partial𝑖 − 𝑤𝑎𝑖 · ˆ𝑦all𝑖 )2 (12) The gradients calculated from 𝑀partial and 𝑀all for the 𝑖𝑡 ℎ prediction, 𝑔 𝑝𝑖 and 𝑔𝑎𝑖 , are deﬁned as shown in Equations 13 and 14, respectively. 𝑔 𝑝𝑖 = ∇𝜖𝑖 (𝑤 𝑝𝑖 ) = −2 · ˆ𝑦partial𝑖 · 𝜖𝑖 (13) 𝑔𝑎𝑖 = ∇𝜖𝑖 (𝑤𝑎𝑖 ) = −2 · ˆ𝑦all𝑖 · 𝜖𝑖 (14) Handling Concept Drift in Global Time Series Forecasting 11 To avoid large gaps between two adjacent weights, the gradients are multiplied by an adjusted rate 𝘂. The updated weights of 𝑀partial and 𝑀all for the 𝑖𝑡 ℎ prediction, 𝑤 𝑝𝑖 and 𝑤𝑎𝑖 , are then deﬁned as shown in Equations 15 and 16, respectively. Based on our preliminary experiments, the value of 𝘂 is ﬁxed to 0.01. 𝑤 𝑝𝑖 = 𝑤 𝑝𝑖−1 − 𝑔 𝑝𝑖−1 · 𝘂 (15) 𝑤𝑎𝑖 = 𝑤𝑎𝑖−1 − 𝑔𝑎𝑖−1 · 𝘂 (16) Equation 17 shows the formula used to obtain the ﬁnal prediction corresponding with the 𝑖𝑡 ℎ time point after weighting. ˆ𝑦𝑖 = 𝑤 𝑝𝑖 · ˆ𝑦 𝑝𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑖 + 𝑤𝑎𝑖 · ˆ𝑦𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖 (17) Algorithm 2 shows the process of the GDW method that is used to obtain the prediction for a given time point.

Thus, the forecasts are obtained from four model combinations, consid- ering two models and two weighting methods. The ﬁnal forecasts of the ECW and GDW methods are obtained by averaging the forecasts provided by the above four model combinations. Our proposed methods are applicable to any GFM including neural networks, machine learning and deep learning models. However, for our experiments, we consider LightGBM [11] as the base learner due to its recent competitive performance over the state-of-the-art forecasting models including deep learning models [31]. 12 Ziyi Liu, Rakshitha Godahewa, Kasun Bandara and Christoph Bergmeir 5 Experimental Framework In this section, we discuss the experimental datasets, error metrics, evaluation method, and benchmarks used in our experiments. 5.1 Datasets We are unaware of any publicly available real-world datasets which contain series showing sudden, incremental and gradual concept drift types, adequately, to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods, ECW and GDW. Thus, in this study, we limit ourselves to the use of simulated datasets that contain series representing sudden, incremental and gradual concept drift types. Let ts1 and ts2 be two time series simulated from the same AR(3) data generation process with diﬀerent initial values and a random seed. The two series are then combined based on the required concept drift type as shown in Equation 18, where 𝑥𝑖 is the 𝑖𝑡 ℎ element of the combined series and series_length is the length of the series. 𝑥𝑖 (sudden) = {ts1𝑖 if 𝑖 < 𝑡drift ts2𝑖 if 𝑖 ≥ 𝑡drift 𝑥𝑖 (incremental) =    ts1𝑖 if 𝑖 < 𝑡start (1 − 𝑤)ts1𝑖 + (𝑤)ts2𝑖 if 𝑡start ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑡end ts2𝑖 if 𝑖 > 𝑡end 𝑥𝑖 (gradual) = {ts1𝑖 if 𝐼𝑖 = 0 ts2𝑖 if 𝐼𝑖 = 1 (18) Where 𝑤 = 𝑖 − 𝑡start 𝑡start − 𝑡end 𝐼𝑖 is random based on probability 𝑝𝑖 𝑝𝑖 = 𝑖 series_length For sudden concept drift, the drift point, 𝑡drift, is randomly selected. The combined series contains ts1 before 𝑡drift and ts2 on and after 𝑡drift. For incremental concept drift, the drift starting point, 𝑡start, and drift ending point, 𝑡end, are randomly selected. The combined series contains ts1 before 𝑡start and ts2 after 𝑡end. A linear weighted combination of ts1 and ts2 is considered in between 𝑡start and 𝑡end where 𝑤 and (1− 𝑤) are the weights of ts2 and ts1, respectively. For gradual concept drift, the combined series contains values from either ts1 or ts2 depending on the corresponding 𝐼𝑖 Handling Concept Drift in Global Time Series Forecasting 13 which is randomised based on an increasing probability, 𝑝𝑖. In general, 𝑝𝑖 is used to represent the probability that an instance belongs to ts2. Thus, when 𝑝𝑖 = 1 the series ultimately enters the new distribution. Finally, three simulated datasets are created that respectively contain series representing sudden, incremental and gradual concept drift types. Each dataset has 2000 series. The length of each series in all datasets is 2000. The ﬁrst 1650 data points in each series are used for model training whereas the last 350 data points in each series are reserved for testing. Note that the drift can occur in either training or testing parts of the series. 5.2 Error Metrics We measure the performance of our models using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error [MAE, 32] which are commonly used error metrics in the time series forecasting ﬁeld. Equations 19 and 20 respectively deﬁne the RMSE and MAE error metrics. Here, 𝐹𝑘 are the forecasts, 𝑌𝑘 are the actual values for the required forecast horizon and ℎ is the forecast horizon. 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 = √︄ Íℎ 𝑘=1 |𝐹𝑘 − 𝑌𝑘 |2 ℎ (19) 𝑀 𝐴𝐸 = Íℎ 𝑘=1 |𝐹𝑘 − 𝑌𝑘 | ℎ (20) Since all these error measures are deﬁned for each time series, we calculate the mean and median values of them across a dataset to measure the model performance. Therefore, four error metrics are used to evaluate each model: mean RMSE, median RMSE, mean MAE and median MAE. 5.3 Evaluation We use prequential evaluation [33] to evaluate the performance of the models. This procedure is also a common evaluation technique used in the forecasting space, where it is normally called time series cross-validation [13]. We conduct the prequential evaluation with increasing block sizes [34] as follows. First, the forecast horizon of each series which consists of 350 data points is divided into 7 test sets of 50 data points each. The models are then trained with the training set and 50 predictions are obtained corresponding with the ﬁrst test set, one at a time iteratively. This procedure is also known as rolling origin without recalibration [35] as the models are not retrained when obtaining individual predic- tions. After obtaining the predictions corresponding with the ﬁrst test set, the actuals corresponding with the ﬁrst test set are also added to the training set. The models are retrained with the new training set and the 50 predictions corresponding with 14 Ziyi Liu, Rakshitha Godahewa, Kasun Bandara and Christoph Bergmeir the second test set are obtained, one at a time iteratively, in a rolling origin with recalibration fashion. This process is repeated until all 350 predictions are obtained corresponding with the complete forecast horizon. 5.4 Benchmarks We consider three types of LightGBM models: plain LightGBM that does not handle concept drift (Plain), LightGBM trained with exponential weighting (EXP) and LightGBM trained with linear weighting (Linear), as the main benchmarks of our study. We also consider three statistical models: AR(3) model, AR(5) model and ETS [1] as the benchmarks of our study. All statistical models are implemented using the Python package, StatsForecast [36]. Each baseline is separately trained considering all data points and the last 200 data points in the training series. Thus, twelve models are ﬁnally considered as benchmarks, considering six LightGBM models and six statistical models. 5.5 Statistical Testing of the Results The non-parametric Friedman rank-sum test is used to assess the statistical signif- icance of the results provided by diﬀerent forecasting models across time series considering a signiﬁcance level of 𝛼 = 0.05. Based on the corresponding RMSE errors, the methods are ranked on every series of a given experimental dataset. The best method according to the average rank is chosen as the control method. To further characterise the statistical diﬀerences, Hochberg’s post-hoc procedure [37] is used. 6 Results and Discussion This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the results of all considered models in terms of main accuracy and statistical signiﬁcance, and later also gives more insights into the modelling. 6.1 Main Accuracy Results Table 1 shows the results of all models across sudden, incremental and gradual concept drift types for mean RMSE, median RMSE, mean MAE and median MAE.

The ﬁrst group contains the statistical baselines we considered which are AR(3), AR(5) and ETS. The second group contains the LightGBM baselines we considered which are the plain LightGBM model (Plain), LightGBM trained with exponential weighting (EXP) and LightGBM trained with linear weighting (Linear). The baseline models also indicate the number of data points used for model training, which is either last 200 data points or all data points. The third group contains our proposed concept drift handling methods, ECW and GDW, which use two LightGBM models to provide forecasts. The hyperparameters of all LightGBM models such as maximum depth, number of leaves, minimum number of instances in a leaf, learning rate and sub- feature leaf are tuned using a grid search approach. For our experiments, we use the Python lightgbm package. In the ﬁrst group, diﬀerent statistical models show the best performance across diﬀerent concept drift types. Overall, AR5_All and AR3_All respectively show the best performance across sudden and incremental concept drift types. Across gradual concept drift, ETS_200 and AR3_All respectively show the best performance on RMSE and MAE metrics. In the second group, EXP_All shows the best performance across sudden and incremental concept drift types whereas Linear_200 shows the best performance across gradual concept drift. The models that use exponential weighting overall show a better performance than the models that use linear weighting. Across all concept drift types, overall, the methods that use exponential and linear weighting show a better performance than the plain LightGBM models which do not handle concept drift. This shows assigning higher weights for the recent series observations is beneﬁcial in handling concept drift. For diﬀerent concept drift types, usage of diﬀerent numbers of training data points shows best results and this indicates using two models trained with the recent series history and full series history may be a better way to handle concept drift. In the third group, our proposed GDW method shows the best performance across all concept drift types. In particular, this method outperforms all considered baselines and shows the best performance on all error metrics. Our proposed ECW method also outperforms all considered baselines on all error metrics across all concept drift types except for 2 cases: AR5_All and ETS_200 on mean RMSE across sudden concept drift. This further shows combining the forecasts of two models trained with the most recent series history and full series history is a proper way of handling concept drift in global time series forecasting. The model trained with the full series history has a high forecasting accuracy where the model trained with the recent series history can quickly adapt to new concepts. Thus, combining the forecasts provided by these two models leads to high forecasting accuracy in particular for the series showing concept drift. The performance improvements gained by the GDW method across diﬀerent concept drift types are relative to the characteristics of the drift type. In particu- lar, compared to the LightGBM baselines, the GDW method shows considerable improvements across the sudden and incremental concept drift types and smaller improvements across the gradual concept drift type in terms of mean RMSE and Handling Concept Drift in Global Time Series Forecasting 17 mean MAE. The drift occurs gradually in the series showing gradual concept drift and thus, there is a possibility that the models have seen instances of the new distri- bution during training. Hence, the baseline LightGBM models have also provided accurate forecasts up to some extent for the series showing gradual concept drift. However, with the series showing sudden or incremental concept drift, there is a high possibility that the models have seen fewer or no instances of the new distribution during training where the drift should be properly handled by the models to provide accurate forecasts. Our proposed GDW method can properly handle concept drift compared to the baselines and thus, across sudden and incremental concept drift types, it shows considerable performance improvements in terms of the forecasting accuracy. 6.2 Statistical Testing Results Table 2 shows the results of the statistical testing evaluation, namely the adjusted 𝑝-values calculated from the Friedman test with Hochberg’s post-hoc procedure considering a signiﬁcance level of 𝛼 = 0.05 [37]. The statistical testing is separately conducted using the three experimental datasets corresponding with sudden, incre- mental and gradual concept drift types. For a given dataset, the RMSE values of each series provided by all methods are considered. Table 2: Results of statistical testing across sudden, incremental and gradual concept drift types. (a) Sudden concept drift Method 𝑝Hoch GDW – ECW 3.56 × 10−9 EXP_All < 10−30 Linear_200 < 10−30 Plain_200 < 10−30 Linear_All < 10−30 EXP_200 < 10−30 Plain_All < 10−30 AR3_200 < 10−30 AR3_All < 10−30 AR5_200 < 10−30 AR5_All < 10−30 ETS_200 < 10−30 ETS_All < 10−30 (b) Incremental concept drift Method 𝑝Hoch GDW – ECW 3.48 × 10−20 EXP_All < 10−30 Linear_200 < 10−30 Plain_200 < 10−30 EXP_200 < 10−30 Linear_All < 10−30 Plain_All < 10−30 AR3_200 < 10−30 AR3_All < 10−30 AR5_200 < 10−30 AR5_All < 10−30 ETS_200 < 10−30 ETS_All < 10−30 (c) Gradual concept drift Method 𝑝Hoch GDW – ECW 8.01 × 10−8 Linear_200 < 10−30 Plain_200 < 10−30 EXP_200 < 10−30 EXP_All < 10−30 Linear_All < 10−30 Plain_All < 10−30 AR3_200 < 10−30 AR3_All < 10−30 AR5_200 < 10−30 AR5_All < 10−30 ETS_200 < 10−30 ETS_All < 10−30 The overall 𝑝-values of the Friedman rank-sum test corresponding with the sud- den, incremental and gradual concept drift types are less than 10−30 showing the results are highly signiﬁcant. For all concept drift types, GDW performs the best 18 Ziyi Liu, Rakshitha Godahewa, Kasun Bandara and Christoph Bergmeir on ranking over RMSE per each series and thus, it is used as the control method as mentioned in the ﬁrst row in each sub-table of Table 2. In all sub-tables, horizontal lines are used to separate the models that perform signiﬁcantly worse than GDW. All benchmarks and ECW show 𝑝Hoch values less than 𝛼 across all concept drift types and thus, they are signiﬁcantly worse than the control method. 6.3 Further Insights Figure 2 shows the performance of all models in terms of MAE and RMSE, across the series showing sudden concept drift with diﬀerent drift points. According to the ﬁgure, our proposed methods, GDW and ECW, show a better performance compared to the baselines in both RMSE and MAE where the GDW shows the best performance in both error metrics. Compared to the ECW and other baselines, the GDW shows a lower error increasing rate. All methods show higher errors for the series where the concept drift occurs in the test set (after 1650 data points) as the models have not seen the corresponding data distributions in the training set. However, even in this phenomenon, we see that the error increasing rate of the GDW method is considerably lower compared with the other methods. M A E R M S E Drift Point Drift Point Fig. 2: Performance of all models in terms of MAE (left) and RMSE (right), across the series showing sudden concept drift with diﬀerent drift points. Figure 3 shows the performance of all models in terms of MAE and RMSE, across the series showing incremental concept drift with diﬀerent drift lengths. Here, the Handling Concept Drift in Global Time Series Forecasting 19 drift length refers to the diﬀerence between the drift starting and ending points. According to the ﬁgure, we see that all models show higher forecasting errors for shorter drift lengths, as the models are required to adapt to the new concept as quickly as possible for shorter drift lengths. Our proposed methods, GDW and ECW, are continuous adaptive weighting methods and they continuously adjust model weights based on the previous prediction error. Thus, GDW and ECW show a better performance compared to the other methods where GDW shows the best performance in both MAE and RMSE.

Thus, handling such concept drift is a crucial issue in the ﬁeld of ML methods for time series forecasting. However, the concept drift handling methods in the literature are mostly designed for classiﬁcation tasks, not for forecasting. In this study, we have proposed two new methods based on continuous adapting weighting, GDW and ECW, to handle concept drift in global time series forecasting. Each proposed method uses two sub-models, a model trained with the most recent series history and a model trained with the full series history, where the weighted 20 Ziyi Liu, Rakshitha Godahewa, Kasun Bandara and Christoph Bergmeir average of the forecasts provided by the two models are considered as the ﬁnal forecasts. The proposed methods calculate the weights that are used to combine the sub-model forecasts based on the previous prediction error. During training, the sub-models internally assign higher weights for the recent observations either exponentially or linearly. Across three simulated datasets that demonstrate sudden, incremental and gradual concept drift types, we have shown that our proposed methods can signiﬁcantly outperform a set of baseline models. In particular, GDW shows the best performance across all considered concept drift types. From our experiments, we conclude that using two models trained with training sets of diﬀerent sizes is a proper approach to handle concept drift in global time series forecasting. We further conclude gradient descent is a proper approach to determine the weights that should be used to combine the forecasts provided by these models. Thus, we recommend the GDW method to handle concept drift in global time series forecasting. The success of this approach encourages as future work to explore the performance of GDW and ECW methods when using three or more sub-models trained using diﬀerent numbers of data points. Analysing the performance of the proposed methods based on the characteristics of the datasets such as the number of series, and the order and parameters of the AR data generation process is also worthwhile to study. It will be also interesting to study the performance of our proposed methods on real-world datasets that adequately demonstrate concept drift. Analysing the performance of our proposed methods across diﬀerent base learners including deep learning models is also a worthwhile endeavour. References [1] R. J. Hyndman, A. B. Koehler, J. K.
