{"path":"lit/lit_sources/Bacon24electNotRedWave.pdf","text":"Democracy Dies in Darkness Opinion Perry Bacon Jr. The election was a Trump splash — but not a red wave Don’t let the electoral map fool you. Trump did not have a sweeping victory. November 11, 2024 4 min 2024 Donald Trump’s victory last week was far more decisive than his triumph in 2016. This time, he carried an additional state (Nevada), received significantly more support from Latino voters and is slated to win the popular vote. Considering Trump was radical during his first term as president and is likely to be even more so a second time around, it’s both stunning and disappointing that he is returning to the Oval Office. Though Trump’s victory has huge implications, it’s important not to overstate what happened last week. Incoming election results and analyses suggest that, though Trump won, America has not shifted decidedly to the right — at least not yet. The country remains roughly split between the two parties electorally, and voters are to the left of the president-elect on many policy issues. You’ve probably seen those maps showing that essentially every area across the country shifted rightward compared with four years ago. But those maps might be exaggerating the scale of the change in voting patterns. In 2020, Joe Biden won about 81 million votes to Trump’s 74 million. Though the vote count for this year isn’t yet complete, particularly in California, Trump will likely win about 79 million votes, besting an estimated 76 million votes cast for Vice President Kamala Harris. So, Democrats lost about 5 million votes compared with 2020, while Republicans gained roughly the same amount. Five million is a lot of people, but it’s only about 3 percent of the electorate (155 million). The overwhelming majority of Americans backed the same party in 2020 and this year. You are very unlikely to bump into a Biden 2020/Trump 2024 voter randomly at a bar. And while some post-election coverage makes it seem like this race was a blowout, Harris won about 48 percent of the popular vote and is likely to finish less than two percentage points behind Trump. And, yes, it’s true that Trump won all seven of this year’s swing states. But Biden won six of those states by similarly narrow margins in 2020. (Democrats lost North Carolina four years ago, too.) Those states are not decidedly more conservative than before. The Republican Party’s narrow advantage becomes particularly clear when you look at downballot races. Democrats won U.S. Senate races in Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin and likely in Arizona, too. (That race hasn’t yet been called by The Post, but Rep. Ruben Gallego is favored to come out ahead.) Democrats also won the races for governor, attorney general and other key statewide contests in North Carolina, another swing state that Harris lost. Republicans will gain control of the Senate largely because they flipped three seats in states (Ohio, Montana and West Virginia) that have become GOP-dominated. They entered last week’s elections controlling 220 House seats and aren’t likely to gain much ground there either. And in terms of policy, voters, including those in red states, took many stands more aligned with the Democratic Party than with the Republicans. Voters in seven states, including Arizona, Missouri and Montana, all of which Trump won, voted to change their states’ constitutions to guarantee abortion rights. Kentucky and Nebraska, two other very Trump-leaning states, rejected school vouchers measures. Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska passed provisions mandating employers provide their workers paid leave; Alaska and Missouri also raised their minimum wage to $15 per hour. Sixty-five percent of Americans said they want abortion to remain legal in most cases, according to the exit polls conducted last week. Fifty-six percent of Americans prefer that undocumented immigrants get a chance to apply for legal status, compared with 40 percent who want them deported, as Trump has proposed. Just 35 percent approve of the Republican-dominated, Trump-aligned U.S. Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade. I don’t want to downplay the gravity of Trump’s victory, nor deny the troubles of Democrats, liberals and leftists. Even in urban areas, where the Democratic Party is strongest, Harris lost ground compared with Biden. Some liberal ballot initiatives and local-level progressive candidates were defeated in very blue California. It makes sense that leftist Democrats are furious at the party’s more centrist establishment and vice versa. Losing twice to Trump should make any political party reevaluate its strategies. And if Democrats don’t make drastic changes, the 2026 and 2028 elections might actually be blowouts. But this year’s election results do not show a country enthralled with Trump, the Republican Party or its plans. The country remains closely divided between the two parties — only the Republicans came out ahead this time.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
