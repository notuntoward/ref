This gave rise to the ﬁeld of contextual optimization, under which data-driven pro- cedures are developed to prescribe actions to the decision-maker that make the best use of the most recently updated information. A large variety of models and methods have been presented in both OR and ML lit- erature under a variety of names, including data-driven optimization, prescriptive optimization, predictive stochastic programming, policy optimization, (smart) predict/estimate-then-optimize, decision-focused learn- ing, (task-based) end-to-end learning/forecasting/optimization, etc. This survey article uniﬁes these models under the lens of contextual stochastic optimization, thus providing a general presentation of a large variety of problems. We identify three main frameworks for learning policies from data and present the existing models and methods under a uniform notation and terminology. Our objective with this survey is to both strengthen the general understanding of this active ﬁeld of research and stimulate further theoretical and algorithmic advancements in integrating ML and stochastic programming. 2 Sadana et al.: A Survey of Contextual Optimization Methods for Decision-Making under UncertaintySadana et al.: A Survey of Contextual Optimization Methods for Decision-Making
