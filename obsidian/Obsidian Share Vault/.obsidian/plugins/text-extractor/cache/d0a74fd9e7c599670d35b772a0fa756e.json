GLOSSARY Doc Ref: SO_OP_2000 24 October 2021 Page 4 of 11 1. GLOSSARY OF TERMS The electricity industry can be a complicated sector to understand for those who are new to it. To help your knowledge of industry terms, AEMO has collated this list of common measures, acronyms, and abbreviations. Many of these are used in AEMO’s power system operating procedures and other AEMO publications. This glossary itself forms part of AEMO’s power system operating procedures made under clause 4.10.1 of the National Electricity Rules (NER). This document uses several terms that are defined in the NER or the National Electricity Law (NEL). Those terms are indicated in italics. Unless the context otherwise requires, AEMO’s power system operating procedures will be interpreted in accordance with Schedule 2 of the National Electricity Law.

Continuous Operating Limit The maximum amount of power that can be transmitted through a transmission element or group of transmission elements such that following the occurrence of a credible contingency event, the flow on the remaining transmission elements will remain within their Continuous Ratings. [Note that Continuous Operating Limits may be determined for a particular transmission element, or for a group of elements (e.g. VIC - NSW import limit).] Continuous Rating The maximum amount of power that can be transmitted continuously through a specified transmission element.
