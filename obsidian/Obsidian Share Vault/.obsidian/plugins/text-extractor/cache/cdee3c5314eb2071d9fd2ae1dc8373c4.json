In cases when only global irradiance measurements 15 are available, separation models are a useful method to estimate DNI and diffuse irradiation. 16 Several of such models have been developed since the 1960s, most of them aiming to deliver 17 estimates in hourly resolution. For higher data resolution, such as in minute data, those 18 models are not able to describe fast transient and cloud enhancement phenomena commonly 19 observed in data with smaller time-steps. This paper proposes an adaptation of the BRL 20 separation model, making it capable of delivering more precise irradiance estimates for 21 higher resolution data. Two models result from this adaptation: one for Brazil and other for 22 Australia. The proposed models yield a more precise DNI and diffuse fraction estimates to 23 their respective countries, compared to other separation models commonly used in the 24 technical literature. For example, using the recommended Combined Performance Index 25 (CPI) as a single statistical indicator, the proposed model yields DNI estimates with CPI from 26 230 to 350 % for Australia, and from 270 to 800 % for Brazil, while the Engerer model, 27 recently recommended as a ‘‘quasi-universal” 1-min separation model, yields DNI estimates 28 with CPI from 500 to 700 % for Australia, and from 600 to 1800 % for Brazil. 29 30 Keywords: Minute global, diffuse and direct irradiance; BRL model; Irradiance separation 31 models; Cloud enhancement 32 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 2 1. Introduction 33 Accurate information about the three components of solar irradiance – global horizontal 34 irradiance (GHI), diffuse horizontal irradiance (DIF) and direct normal irradiance (DNI) – is 35 fundamental for the correct design and performance assessment of solar energy systems. For 36 instance, designing flat-plate solar collectors or fixed PV systems requires information of the 37 global tilted irradiance (GTI) incident on the array plane, which is estimated from the values 38 of the irradiance components. On the other hand, only the direct irradiance can be 39 concentrated, therefore DNI results are essential for the assessment of concentrating solar 40 power (CSP) and concentrating PV (CPV) systems. Nonetheless, the measurement of the 41 three components at the same time (GHI, DNI and DIF) is expensive, since it requires 42 complex tracking devices and significant operational efforts. As a result, the data is not 43 always available, and in some cases the measurements are commonly incomplete due to 44 equipment malfunctions or poor maintenance. To illustrate this scenario, Brazil has an 45 extensive radiation measurement network, operated by the National Institute of Meteorology 46 (INMET) [1], which comprises approximately seven hundred stations measuring only global 47 solar irradiance. In contrast, the Brazilian Environmental Data Organization System 48 (SONDA) [2] has only seventeen stations measuring the three irradiance components [3]. 49 A common approach to overcome the lack of reliable information is using some sort of 50 separation model to estimate both diffuse and direct components from global irradiance 51 observations. Even in locations where no irradiance measurements are available, it is possible 52 to consider satellite imagery and semi-physical models [4,5] to estimate GHI, and then apply 53 a separation model to estimate the other two components [6]. 54 The need for an accurate assessment of the three irradiance components is crucial for 55 sizing and selecting solar energy technologies and applications, necessitating an ongoing 56 pursuit of precise separation models. The separation models for irradiance components were 57 initially developed in the 1960s by Liu & Jordan [7], and since then hundreds of models have 58 been proposed in the literature. Those models are derived from locally-measured data from 59 different stations; different climatic conditions; modelling different temporal resolutions (e.g 60 .monthly daily, hourly, minute); and considering one or several input variables (predictors) 61 [8]. Moreover, these models consider different kinds of equations, most of them using linear 62 piece-wise equations [9,10]; polynomial piece-wise equations [11]; quasi-physical models 63 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3 [12]; artificial neural networks [13]; and more recent studies use simple logistical 64 relationships [14–17]; while other studies consider more complex approaches using machine 65 learning techniques to combine different separations models [8]. 66 Recently, Gueymard and Ruiz-Arias [6] reported an extensive validation study in 67 which they tested 140 separation models considering the radiation data from 54 research-68 class stations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network - BSRN. The authors employed 69 high quality 1-min data of global and direct irradiance to assess the performance of these 70 separation models for 1-min DNI predictions. They found that cloud enhancement and high-71 albedo effects intensify the errors in irradiance measurement. Usually, models that consider 72 variability and clear-sky irradiance as predictors tend to perform better. Most models 73 overestimate DNI in cases when the solar intensity increases, caused by scattered irradiance 74 from nearby clouds, commonly denominated as cloud enhancements events. The exceptions 75 are the Engerer2 [17] and Perez2 [4] models, which tend to underestimate the DNI in a small 76 degree in those events. Gueymard and Ruiz-Arias recommend 9 models as candidates for 77 providing accurate and consistent results; Engerer2, Perez2, Boland5, Engerer1, Hollands2, 78 Perez1, Perez3, Skartveit1 and Yao2 (according to the nomenclature defined by Gueymard). 79 As discussed in [6], the success of Engerer2 model is probably because this model was 80 derived from 1-min data, thus allowing it to predict fast transient phenomena, such as cloud 81 enhancements. 82 Based on the information gathered in recent studies [6,18,19], hourly separation 83 models are not enough to meet the current demands of the industry, since they are not able to 84 appropriately describe fast transient episodes. In addition, the temporal resolution of solar 85 radiation data has considerably improved, since modern radiometric stations are able to 86 provide it in intervals ranging from 1 to 10-min. Moreover, to reduce the economic 87 uncertainty and improve the economic attractiveness of solar energy systems, the energy 88 simulation programs should consider solar radiation databases with time-steps significantly 89 shorter than one hour (as in standard TMY databases). For instance, CSP plants present non-90 linear and transient effects that are substantially affected by the temporal resolution of the 91 solar data, meaning 10-min or less is the ideal time step for simulating these kind of systems 92 [20,21]. For PV applications, the temporal resolution requirements are even more stringent, 93 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4 since the effects caused by cloud enhancement are being studied at a time step of 3-seconds 94 [19,22,23]. 95 Hence, our main motivation is to develop a new separation model valid for 1-min 96 irradiation data (global, diffuse and direct), and able to capture transient effects of irradiance, 97 such as cloud enhancement. Modelling cloud enhancement in a separation model is not new, 98 it was first introduced in [24], where the author proposed a separation model based in a 99 generalized logistic function, and considering a new predictor and a linear correction to 100 account the cloud enhancement events. This new predictor contemplates the deviation 101 between the clearness index and the clear index of a clear-sky, while the linear correction is 102 an offset term based on the ratio between actual and clear-sky global horizontal irradiance. 103 The [24] model was recommended by Gueymard and Ruiz-Arias [6] as one of the most 104 accurate models, its success is probably because it was derived from 1-min data. Based on the 105 poor results of Engerer model for Brazil and to a certain extent for Australia when 106 considering indicators of distribution similitude, it is most likely that the linear correction 107 used by Engerer to account the cloud enhancements events is not enough to model this 108 phenomenon. 109 Therefore, the main goal of this study is to derive a separation model, based on a 110 logistical function using 1-min global, diffuse and direct irradiance data. The model should 111 be able to capture transient effects of irradiance, providing accurate and consistent results. 112 The choice of a logistical function is based on the recent achievements of this kind of models 113 [15,16,24], comprising an exceptional performance, and a much simpler approach than other 114 models. However, the sigmoidal shape of the logistical function makes impossible for the 115 BRL model to capture the cloud enhancement events, i.e. the increase in the diffuse fraction 116 for clearness index higher than 0.8. To overcome this, we propose to add modelled clear-sky 117 irradiance (CSI) as a predictor and use a piecewise function. The intervals of the function’s 118 domain are defined by the ratio between global horizontal and global clear-sky irradiances. 119 For the sake of simplicity, the same logistical equation is used in both sub-domains. To assess 120 the performance of this new model a formal error analysis is performed, based on 121 comparisons between our work and the models of Ridley [15] , Engerer [24], Skartveit et al. 122 [25] and Perez et al. [4]. 123 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5 The BRL separation model [15] (Ridley2) is adopted as basis for the model proposed 124 herein, but introducing modifications to consider the phenomena related to fast transients. 125 The choice for the BRL (Ridley2) [15] model instead of Boland5 [16] (as originally 126 suggested in [6]), is due to two reasons. The first one is that the Boland5 model [16] shows 127 that the use of a logistical model for directly calculating DNI from GHI provides marginal 128 differences between DNI values calculated using diffuse fraction estimates from the (BRL) 129 Ridley2 model. The second reason is our preference for using the classical approach of 130 developing a model to calculate the diffuse fraction (d = DIFF/GHI), and then calculating the 131 DNI from the relation (DNI = (1-d)GHI/sin α). 132 2. BRL logistic model for minute irradiance 133 Boland et al. [26] demonstrated with statistical rigour the usefulness of employing a 134 logistical instead of piecewise linear or simple nonlinear functions for modelling diffuse 135 fraction. Afterwards, Ridley et al. [15] proposed the generic multiple predictor logistic model, 136 known as the Boland–Ridley–Lauret (BRL) model, given by, 137 \u0000\u0000 = 1 1 + \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 = 1 1 + \t \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000.\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000.\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 . \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 . !\u0000\u0000\".!\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\".\u0000\"\u0000\u0000 (1) 138 where \u0000\u0000 is the modelled diffuse fraction, kT is the hourly clearness index, defined as the ratio 139 of the global irradiance on a horizontal surface (Ig) to the extraterrestrial irradiance at the top 140 of the atmosphere (I0), also on a horizontal surface. AST is the apparent solar time, α is the 141 solar altitude, KT is the daily clearness index, and ψ is a persistence factor defined in [15]. 142 The numerical values of the coefficients (β0, β1,…, β5) in Equation (1) are also derived in [15] 143 using data from three meteorological stations in the southern hemisphere and four in the 144 northern hemisphere. This model aims to use a minimum of measured variables; therefore, all 145 the predictors can easily be calculated by well-known functions of solar geometry [27] (i.e. 146 apparent solar time (AST), solar altitude (#\u0000, extraterestrial irradiance), and measurements of 147 global, direct and diffuse irradiance (to calculate clearness index, daily clearness index and 148 persistence factor). 149 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6 Figure 1a depicts the relationship between diffuse fraction and clearness index (k T). 150 Four regions are observed in the d-kT envelop, there are overcast, partly cloudy, clear-sky and 151 cloud enhancements conditions. It can be seen that the overcast and clear-sky regions have a 152 significant larger concentration of data points, being followed by the partly cloudy region. 153 However, the cloud enhancement region has as many occurrences as partly cloudy, showing 154 that this phenomenon should be considered in analysis of 1-min irradiance data. Additionally, 155 Figure 1b depicts the d-kT envelope for Florianopolis (Brazil), as well as the diffuse fraction 156 estimated by the BRL model. It is observed that the logistical form of BRL model captures 157 the shape of the envelope for values for kT close to 0.8. For higher values of kT, the BRL 158 model underestimates the diffuse fraction in the region characterised by the cloud 159 enhancement phenomena. 160 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 7 \\ (a) (b) Figure 1 – Observed d-kT envelop of 1-min irradiance data from Florianopolis – Brazil; (a) the colormap denotes the density 161 of points (counts number). Four regions are highlighted: overcast, partly cloudy, clear-sky and cloud enhancements events; 162 (b) overlaid with BRL generic multiple predictor logistical model. 163 Although the sigmoidal shape of the BRL model can’t completely capture the shape 164 of 1-min data, Lemos et al. [3] demonstrated that the BRL model is able to capture the larger 165 spread of data observed in 1-min measurements, and properly fit the data if the cloud 166 enhancements events are removed using estimations of clear-sky irradiance. That approach 167 allowed the researchers to validate the usefulness of the model and extend its applications for 168 modelling solar irradiance in shorter time-steps. 169 In order to predict the phenomena observed in 1-min data, a piecewise logistical 170 function is proposed, where the domain break point is defined by the parameter KCSI, which is 171 defined as the ratio of the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and global clear-sky irradiance 172 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 8 (CSI). Therefore, it is possible to separate the model accounting for cloud enhancement 173 events as a particular case. Moreover, the global clear-sky irradiance is added as a predictor 174 because, as pointed out by [6], the models that take into account this parameter are in better 175 agreement with experimental data. Thus, the diffuse fraction estimated by BRL-minute model 176 is given by, 177 \u0000\u0000 = $ 1 1 + \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000%&'\u0000(\u0000 , *'\u0000( < 1.05 1 1 + \u0000\u0000\u0000.\u0000\u0000/\u0000\u0000\u0000\u00000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000%\u0000\u0000'\u0000(\u0000 , *'\u0000( ≥ 1.05\t23\u0000\t4\u0000 > 0.65 (2) 178 where \u0000\u0000 is the modelled diffuse fraction, from the new model, kT is the hourly clearness 179 index, AST is the apparent solar time, α is the solar altitude, KT is the daily clearness index, 180 and ψ is the persistence factor, CSI is the clear-sky irradiance and KCSI is defined as the ratio 181 of the measured global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and the modelled global clear-sky 182 irradiance (CSI). The numeric values of the coefficients (β0, β1, …, β13) in Equation (2) will 183 be derived using irradiance data from eight meteorological stations. 184 The choice of using KCSI for splitting the sub-domains is due to its clear and intuitive 185 interpretation, since values higher than unity means cloud enhancement events (CEE). The 186 numerical value of 1.05 is established to avoid misleading classification, since clear-sky 187 models have some approximation errors and can underestimate the clear-sky values. 188 Clearness index higher than 0.65 (kT>0.65) is considered to ensure that the second function 189 does not affect non-cloud enhancement events. Both values (1.05 and 0.65) are chosen 190 because of their physical significance: (i) GHI higher than CSI, (ii) physical impossibility of 191 existence of CEE for clearness index lower than 0.65. Hence, this value is a conservative one, 192 in comparison to the one suggested by Gueymard [18], who assumed kT>0.8, as the definition 193 for CEE. Moreover, based on the analysis conducted herein, these two values do not depend 194 on the particular location being analysed, and therefore they can be assumed as general 195 constraints. 196 The proposed BRL-minute model was developed using CSI calculated by the broadband 197 simplified analytical version of the Solis model [28]. This model estimates clear-sky 198 irradiance at the evaluated site by multiplying the extraterrestrial irradiance (calculated 199 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9 using site latitude and longitude) by a correction factor that is a function of aerosol optical 200 depth, atmosphere water vapor content and site altitude. The aerosol optical depth and 201 atmospheric water-vapor content were taken from the MACC-II project database [29,30], 202 which provides atmospheric composition data from 2003 up to 2012. However, for stations 203 with data extending beyond 2012, the information of the last year is used as an approximation 204 to the atmospheric composition of the following years. This simplification has a minor impact 205 in the proposed model as further discussed. The adoption of the broadband simplified Solis 206 model is justified because it can be easily implemented, it is a fast algorithm and provides 207 roughly the same level of performance as other models [31], such as McClear [32] or REST2 208 [33]. 209 3. Methodology 210 To build the BRL-minute model the fourteen parameters 7 , 7\", … 7\"\u0000 are estimated 211 through a least-square regression, considering measured minute data (global, diffuse and 212 direct irradiance). The least-square procedure is fully described in [15], while the 213 construction of a logistical separation models using minute data is described in [3]. For that 214 purpose, two thirds of the data points were randomly selected from the set and used to 215 determine the new βi coefficients. The resulting correlation was then applied to the remaining 216 third of the data to validate the model and determine the agreement through error indicators. 217 Hence, to assess the performance of the model, irradiance data from eight radiometric 218 stations were considered, as described in Table 1. Note that data from specified periods were 219 used, but they are not necessary continuous. 220 Table 1 – Information on the eight station used for validation and creating the models. 221 Code Station Lat.

Therefore, the quality of the 227 model depends on the limitation and experimental error of the measured 1-min irradiance 228 data, in these case all three components (global, direct and diffuse irradiance) [6]. This means 229 that the raw data should be initially filtered and validated, in order to guarantee the quality of 230 the database, and ensuring that inconsistent and suspicious data would be removed. 231 3.1. Data and quality control 232 Recently, Lemos et al. [3] developed a robust procedure for quality control, which 233 consists of nine steps: first filters (physical limits and solar altitude limit), plausibility check, 234 consistency check, tracker off test, data variability test, overcast test, Rayleigh limit, clear-235 sky comparison and outlier removal. In the present work, the first seven steps are considered. 236 The clear-sky comparison is unnecessary because cloud enhancements are considered in the 237 present model. In addition, the outlier removal is not applied since the previous steps already 238 removed most of the suspicions data. Thus, the numeric values presented in the last column 239 (N) of Table 1 denote the number of points in which the three irradiance components were 240 flagged as qualified after quality control is carried out, and used in further analysis. 241 3.2. Statistical indicators 242 Gueymard [34] presented a complete review of performance indicators that can be used in 243 radiation models for validations purposes. Among those, four statistical indicators were 244 considered for the formal error analysis: normalized MAD, normalized RMSE, normalized 245 MBE, and the Combined Performance Index (CPI), introduced in [35]. The first three 246 indicators are classified by Gueymard [34] as Class A (indicators of dispersion), while the 247 last one is considered Class C (indicators of cumulative distribution function (CDF) 248 similitude). Being the CPI recommended in the cases where only one statistical indicator had 249 to be selected. These indicators are defined as follows, 250 9:; = 100 \u0000̅ =∑ ?\u0000@A − \u0000C\t?

The CPI combines standard statistical measurements (RMSE) 255 and two measurements of similarity between CDF (KSI and OVER), where the three values 256 are expressed in percentages. The main advantage of the CPI is the high degree of 257 discrimination between different models, as established in [34]. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov 258 test Integral (KSI) was proposed in [36] as a measure to compute the differences between 259 CDFs, and is expressed as follows, 260 *HQ = 100 #X Y ;D\u0000Z [\\]^ [\\_` (7) 261 where ZaCD and Zab[ are the limiting values of the independent variable, while ;D is the 262 difference between the CDF of the measurements and the estimated values. The #X parameter 263 is defined as #X = SX\u0000Zab[ − ZaCD\u0000. The critical value SX depends on the population size 3 264 and is calculated for a 99% level of confidence as SX = 1.63 √3⁄ , 3 ≥ 35. With a KSI equal 265 to zero the distributions are equivalent, and for larger values of KSI the model is considered 266 non fitting to the dataset. 267 The OVER indicator was also proposed by Espinar et al. [36], which is based on the KSI 268 test. OVER accounts for the differences between two CDFs when they exceed a critical limit 269 (SX), therefore, it can be calculated in percentage as follows, 270 RSIG = 100 #X Y max\u0000;D − SX, 0\u0000 \u0000Z [\\]^ [\\_` (8) 271 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 12 4. Model validation 272 The model was initially adjusted for each particular station to perform a graphical 273 comparison, which is depicted in Figure 2. As observed in the figure, the proposed model 274 shows a good fit for the complete data set, capturing the “high clearness index – intermediate 275 diffuse fraction” values. 276 Table 2 summarizes the formal error analysis of the proposed BRL-minute model and the 277 “on-site” adjusted hourly BRL model [15] (BRL-local), for selected stations. The “on-site” 278 BRL model is used as reference to illustrate the improvements of the proposed model. As 279 observed in the table, the new model performs better than the reference, reducing all 280 indicators of dispersion (Class A). Moreover, it shows significant improvements on the DNI 281 estimations. Regarding the similitude between the distributions, both the BRL-local model 282 and the proposed BRL-minute present almost the same CPI value for diffuse fraction in 283 Florianopolis, but the BRL-minute have a significant improvement on the CPI value for DNI. 284 For Adelaide, the new model also shows a significant improvement on the CPI value for 285 diffuse fraction, while the DNI presents equivalent values. 286 Comparing Figure 2 against the logistical format of BRL model in Figure 1b, the new 287 model offers a better similitude of the distributions, ratified by the indicators in Table 2. 288 Despite the similitude of distributions, the new model is evidently better than the BRL-local 289 model, due to the capture of cloud enhancement events (CEE), that is not reflected in the 290 values depicted in Table 2. Those unsatisfactory results are explained by the small quantity of 291 CEE points observed in Figure 1a. 292 Table 2 – Error analysis for the “on-site” BRL and BRL-minute models, for Florianopolis and Adelaide. 293 Florianopolis Adelaide d DNI d DNI MAD (%) BRL local 14.92 15.23 29.53 11.42 BRL-minute 12.56 12.22 24.51 9.19 RMSE (%) BRL local 21.27 23.89 43.80 17.32 BRL-minute 18.50 18.87 37.77 13.88 MBE (%) BRL local -1.09 3.60 -0.49 0.39 BRL-minute 0.62 1.68 0.83 -0.27 CPI (%) BRL local 201.41 243.17 295.43 163.59 BRL-minute 219.95 193.27 237.16 169.61 294 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 13 The site-specific models ( β parameters), formal error analysis of the new model and 295 the reference models (Ridley [15] , Engerer [24], Skartveit et al.

Results 307 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 15 The previous section presented further developments for the BRL model, showing its 308 potential for modelling diffuse fraction on 1-min time scales. The present model showed 309 significant improvements for “on-site” analysis, performing better than all other models it 310 was compared to. The outstanding performance of the new model encourages developing a 311 generic model suitable for more locations. However, since the number of stations considered 312 herein is limited, it is only possible to propose generic models for Australia and Brazil. 313 Ridley et al. [15] developed a robust method for estimating the parameters of logistical 314 separation models, which consists of merging the qualified data from individual stations in a 315 single data set and submitting it to a nonlinear least-square regression. To avoid location bias 316 in the regression, the same amount of data from each station should be considered for each 317 country, and then subjected to the amalgamation process. After such a procedure, a new set of 318 βi coefficients for each of Australia and Brazil was estimated, as described in the following 319 sections. 320 After the development of the model using the amalgamated data of each country, the 321 model is then applied to the data of each station separately, where a graphical performance 322 and a formal error analysis were performed. Furthermore, the present model was compared 323 against estimated data from well-kwon separation models. All the parameters for the different 324 models and the results are given in the supplementary material, depicting statistical 325 indicators, such as KSI, OVER and coefficient of determination (R2) 326 5.1. Australia 327 The parameters estimated for Australian locations are given in Table 3.

The estimates delivered by the 333 new and reference models are overlaid with actual data in a d-kT envelop and DNI-kT 334 envelop. The proposed model presents a good agreement for the complete data set, as 335 observed in Figure 3a and Figure 4a, and evidenced in Table 4 (detailed below). The original 336 BRL model seems to fit the data reasonably well; however, it underestimates the diffuse 337 fraction for high clearness index. The Engerer model also presents a good fit, capturing the 338 shape of the data, yet it underestimates the diffuse fraction in the region where a large 339 quantity of measurements is available (0.5 ≤ kT ≥0.8). Skartveit’s model seems to fit the data 340 reasonably well, capturing all the regions of data, but it is not able to capture the overall 341 dispersion. Finally, Perez’s model also shows good fitness, nevertheless it shows sequential 342 points, almost creating lines, featuring an unusual behaviour. Regarding the DNI estimates 343 (Figure 4), the BRL-minute depicts a fine adjustment to the data set, including the cloud 344 enhancements events. The original BRL model overestimates the DNI values for high 345 clearness index and the Engerer model seems to underestimate the DNI values over the 346 complete data set. Finally, Skartveit’s and Perez’s models seem to finely capture the 347 tendencies of the data, but similar to the other models they do not capture the dispersion. 348 (a) BRL-Minute (present model) (b) BRL MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 17 (c) Engerer (d) Skartveit (e) Perez Figure 3 - Adelaide diffuse fraction data with estimates from different models overlaid. 349 (a) BRL-Minute (present model) (b) BRL (c) Engerer (d) Skartveit (e) Perez Figure 4 - Adelaide DNI data with estimates from different models overlaid. 350 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 18 Regarding the formal error analysis, Table 4 presents a comparison between the BRL, 351 Engerer, Perez, Skartveit and the new BRL-minute models, against the actual diffuse fraction 352 and DNI data from Australia. The performance of the models was assessed in terms of the 353 MAD, RMSE, MBE and CPI. The results for the diffuse fraction show that the BRL-minute 354 model performs similarly to the Perez model, and both models perform significantly better 355 than the other ones analysed herein. However, when comparing the errors for DNI estimates, 356 it is clearly seen that the proposed model performs better than the other models considered, 357 showing significant improvements in similarity between distribution of data (CPI). Inspecting 358 the MBE values for the BRL-minute model, it reflects a non-consistent improvement in the 359 model performance, since some locations present a significant reduction, and others do not. 360 One possible reason for this behaviour is due to the fact that the model was developed for a 361 generic country, rather than a climate model, as suggested by Gueymard [6]. 362 Table 4 – Error analysis of diffuse fraction and DNI estimates for the Australian BRL-minute, BRL, Engerer, Perez and 363 Skartveit models, all against the actual data for each location in Australia. 364 Diffuse fraction Direct normal Irradiance Adelaide Darwin Mount Gambier Woomera Adelaide Darwin Mount Gambier Woomera MAD (%) BRL 30.9 27.8 27.4 33.1 12.0 11.1 10.3 10.1 Engerer 30.4 29.5 31.2 37.0 11.5 11.5 11.8 11.0 Perez 24.6 18.8 24.0 24.2 20.9 18.6 18.4 17.4 Skartveit 26.9 22.5 27.0 24.3 10.1 8.9 9.8 7.0 BRL-min 25.0 20.9 24.3 24.9 9.4 8.1 8.9 7.2 RMSE (%) BRL 45.8 35.7 41.8 48.5 18.5 14.6 16.2 15.2 Engerer 42.2 38.6 41.5 47.3 15.5 14.5 14.8 13.6 Perez 37.9 28.5 35.4 38.9 34.0 30.1 30.7 31.1 Skartveit 44.8 36.4 43.5 44.4 16.9 14.8 15.5 12.9 BRL-min 38.3 30.2 36.4 39.5 14.0 11.5 12.9 11.2 MBE (%) BRL -4.0 9.3 -7.3 0.2 1.88 -3.25 3.02 0.22 Engerer 10.3 16.2 12.9 20.9 -3.90 -6.00 -5.02 -6.26 Perez 0.9 0.1 1.3 1.4 -7.03 -9.29 -4.91 -8.57 Skartveit -17.6 -8.8 -18.5 -12.8 7.20 4.23 7.55 4.25 BRL-min 0.1 5.3 -3.2 1.1 -0.02 -1.86 1.17 -0.35 CPI (%) BRL 647.5 631.3 539.6 416.2 390.2 467.0 343.1 207.5 Engerer 672.5 933.9 610.4 715.6 514.6 680.9 514.0 554.1 Perez 411.4 267.2 338.8 263.7 1796.2 1220.5 1658.7 1047.9 Skartveit 912.1 538.5 781.7 425.8 797.9 476.9 662.1 368.0 BRL-min 424.2 350.9 394.7 310.5 302.9 233.9 270.9 203.0 365 5.2. Brazil 366 The new separation model was also employed for developing a model adjusted for 367 Brazilian conditions, where the parameters estimated are presented in Table 5. A graphical 368 comparison in terms of diffuse fraction and DNI for Florianopolis is presented in Figure 5 369 and Figure 6, respectively. The new BRL-minute presents a fine adjustment to the complete 370 data set, while the original BRL model underestimates the diffuse fraction and overestimates 371 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 19 the DNI. In turn, Engerer’s model overestimate the diffuse fraction, and clearly overestimates 372 the DNI. Finally, although it appears that Skartveit’s and Perez’s models fit reasonably well 373 the data, neither can capture all the dispersion of points. 374 Table 5 – Parameters of Equation 2 determined for Brazil, hereafter known as the BRL-minute model for Brazil. 375 Parameter Value β0 -6.37505 β1 6.68399 β2 0.01667 β3 0.02552 β4 3.32837 β5 1.97935 β6 -0.74116 β7 0.19486 β8 -3.52376 β9 -0.00325 β10 -0.03737 β11 2.68761 β12 1.60666 β13 1.07129 376 377 (a) BRL-Minute (present model) (b) BRL (c) Engerer (d) Skartveit MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 20 (e) Perez Figure 5 - Florianopolis diffuse fraction data with estimates from different models overlaid. 378 (a) BRL-Minute (present model) (b) BRL (c) Engerer (d) Skartveit (e) Perez Figure 6 - Florianopolis DNI data with estimates from different models overlaid. 379 Formal error analysis for Brazilian stations is presented in Table 6, in terms of the 380 four error indicators, and comparing the results between the BRL, Engerer, Perez, Skartveit 381 and the new BRL-minute models. As observed for the Australia model, the BRL-minute 382 model performs similarly to the Perez model in terms of diffuse fraction, with the exception 383 of the MBE, which is slightly higher than Perez’s. However, for DNI estimates, the BRL-384 minute performs significantly better than all other models, which is depicted by all the 385 indicators considered and for all locations analysed. It is worth mentioning that the proposed 386 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 21 model showed notable improvements in terms of CPI (reducing to half for diffuse fraction 387 and to one third for DNI), indicating high similitude between data distributions. 388 Table 6 – Error analysis of diffuse fraction and DNI estimates for the Brazilian BRL-minute, BRL, Engerer, Perez and Skartveit 389 models, all against the actual data for each location in Brazil. 390 Diffuse fraction Direct normal Irradiance Florianopolis São Martinho da Serra Brasilia Petrolina Florianopolis São Martinho da Serra Brasilia Petrolina MAD (%) BRL 16.7 17.4 17.9 36.4 17.0 11.9 14.8 18.5 Engerer 16.2 21.3 17.5 33.8 15.6 13.1 12.7 16.9 Perez 12.6 13.0 12.9 22.5 20.9 20.5 20.0 26.7 Skartveit 14.4 13.2 14.8 29.2 15.0 11.4 13.5 14.3 BRL-min 13.0 13.6 12.8 25.0 12.9 10.2 11.0 12.5 RMSE (%) BRL 22.5 23.9 24.0 43.0 25.2 19.7 22.8 21.9 Engerer 22.4 28.2 25.6 43.4 22.5 18.6 19.2 20.6 Perez 18.5 19.9 19.3 30.8 37.1 38.3 34.8 35.6 Skartveit 22.0 21.8 23.1 38.1 24.6 18.9 21.8 18.2 BRL-min 19.1 20.5 19.6 32.6 19.7 15.9 17.0 15.6 MBE (%) BRL -1.4 1.8 0.3 16.4 3.7 4.0 4.3 -9.8 Engerer 6.5 14.4 10.2 21.2 -4.1 -5.9 -3.8 -11.7 Perez 0.6 0.6 -0.5 -0.4 -1.8 -6.2 -6.3 -19.0 Skartveit -6.2 -2.9 -2.8 0.1 10.2 8.5 8.3 -1.6 BRL-min -2.6 -0.3 -1.6 6.3 4.5 5.1 5.3 -5.4 CPI (%) BRL 534.4 815.5 772.5 1955.1 612.4 856.0 799.7 1770.9 Engerer 751.2 2267.4 1702.0 2283.9 629.4 868.6 702.5 1796.8 Perez 391.5 624.2 626.3 574.0 2365.9 4961.7 3841.9 1472.2 Skartveit 777.0 642.0 978.2 720.7 1132.1 2565.5 2551.6 579.9 BRL-min 549.5 697.7 578.9 839.0 278.0 543.6 700.6 850.5 391 5.3. Influence of CSI model 392 Using clear-sky irradiance as a model predictor increases the complexity of the model, 393 which is not desirable. Additionally, creating a diffuse fraction model that can only be used 394 with a specific clear-sky model, generates a constraint that narrows the versatility of the 395 model. The present analysis assessed the dependency of the proposed model to the model 396 which delivers the CSI estimates (broadband simplified Solis clear-sky model). In that 397 context, the impact of using different clear-sky models to evaluate the proposed minute 398 diffuse fraction model was assessed, the aim being to verify if only the broadband simplified 399 Solis model should be used to evaluate the BRL-minute model. For that purpose, the use of 400 simple clear-sky models was considered, such as Perez–Ineichen [4] or Bird [37]. The inputs 401 for the Perez-Ineichen model (i.e. Linke turbidity factor) were taken from the SoDa service 402 [38], as described in [39]. To avoid implementation mistakes the model was downloaded 403 from PV_LIB Toolbox [40], developed at Sandia National Laboratories. The Bird model also 404 requires aerosol optical depth values and atmospheric water-vapor content as inputs, which 405 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 22 were obtained from the MACC-II database, being the aerosol optical depth calculated for the 406 specific wavelength using two values available on the database. 407 The BRL-minute model of each country is re-calculated for each station, but 408 considering the clear-sky global irradiance from Bird and Ineichen-Perez, rather than the 409 broadband simplified Solis model. Table 7 summarizes the results of this analysis for one 410 station in Australia and Brazil, while the results for all stations are presented in the 411 Supplementary Material. 412 As observed in Table 7 the different inputs delivered by the clear-sky models do not 413 affect the MAD and RMSE indicators. However, they do affect the mean bias error 414 (MBE) and the similitude of data distribution (CPI). Yet, those differences are small, 415 indicating that other clear-sky models could be used – recalling that more precise models 416 should help to deliver precise results. Taking a closer look into the error indicators for all 417 stations (supplementary material), it is possible to confirm that larger differences occur in 418 the MBE and CPI, with slightly differences on the MAD and RMSE. Finally, itis worth 419 mentioning that in the case of using less precise clear-sky models, it is possible to change 420 the breakpoint of the proposed piece-wise function \u0000*'\u0000( ≥ 1.05\u0000 in Equation 2. This is 421 possible because *'\u0000( is only used to classify if the event is a cloud enhancement or not. 422 Therefore, the accuracy of the CSI models has a minor effect when using a small offset 423 (around 1.05) for the piece-wise breakpoint. 424 Table 7 – Error analysis of BRL-minute model considering different clear-sky models. 425 Clear-sky model Florianopolis Adelaide d DNI d DNI MAD (%) Solis 13.0 12.9 25.0 9.4 Bird 13.6 13.1 26.1 9.4 Ineichen-Perez 13.2 13.8 25.9 9.6 RMSE (%) Solis 19.1 19.7 38.3 14.0 Bird 19.4 19.5 38.8 13.6 Ineichen-Perez 19.5 21.6 38.9 14.2 MBE (%) Solis -2.6 4.5 0.1 -0.02 Bird -1.5 3.0 2.9 -1.2 Ineichen-Perez -3.2 5.8 1.4 -0.6 CPI (%) Solis 549.5 278.0 424.2 302.9 Bird 602.8 362.3 493.4 382.6 Ineichen-Perez 517.3 280.7 475.3 351.3 426 6. Conclusions 427 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 23 Accurate information about the three components of solar irradiance is fundamental for 428 the correct design and performance assessment of solar energy systems. Yet, measuring the 429 three irradiance components is expensive, requiring complex tracking devices and significant 430 operational efforts. A common approach to overcome the lack of reliable information is using 431 some sort of separation model to estimate both diffuse and direct components from global 432 horizontal irradiance (GHI) observations. Taking these facts into consideration, the objective 433 of this study is to derive a separation model based on a logistical function using 1-min data, 434 which should be able to capture transient effects of irradiance, providing accurate and 435 consistent results. To do so, we propose using a piecewise logistical function and add the 436 clear-sky irradiance (CSI) as a predictor. 437 The results showed that for the “on-site” analysis, the proposed model performs better 438 than the adjusted BRL model, capturing the cloud enhancement events (CEE). This result is 439 evidenced analysing the KSI values for both adjusted BRL and BRL-minute models for each 440 station (Supplementary Material), which depict reductions of up to 200 %. Compared to other 441 models, the new model performs significantly better than the original BRL, Engerer, 442 Skartveit and Perez models, for both diffuse fraction and DNI, and for all stations considered 443 herein. The new BRL-minute model presents similar dispersion indicators to the Perez model, 444 but a significantly lower CPI. 445 Because of the similarity between the adjusted coefficients for each station, a general 446 model for each country, Brazil and Australia, was also proposed, and then compared against 447 traditional models, such as: BRL, Engerer, Skartveit and Perez. The results for the diffuse 448 fraction shows that BRL-minute model performs similarly to the Perez model, and both 449 models perform significantly better than the other analysed herein. However, when 450 comparing the errors for DNI estimates, it is clearly seen that the proposed model performs 451 better than the other models considered, including the Perez model, showing significant 452 improvements in similarity with respect to the data distribution (CPI). For Australia, the 453 BRL-minute model (DNI estimates) performs with MAD ranging from 7 to 9 %, RMSE from 454 11 to 14 %, MBE from -2 to 2 % and CPI from 230 to 350%. For Brazil, the BRL-minute 455 model (DNI estimates) performs with MAD ranging from 10 to 13 %, RMSE from 15 to 456 20 %, MBE from -5 to 5 % and CPI from 270 to 800%. 457 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 24 Finally, the influence of the clear-sky irradiance estimates on the proposed BRL-minute 458 models is assessed. The models were built using broadband simplified Solis model, and then 459 assessed with clear-sky estimated provided by Bird and Ineichen-Perez models. The results 460 indicate that the use of different models does not affect the MAD and RMSE indicators, but 461 has a minor influence on the mean bias error (MBE) and the similitude of data distribution 462 (CPI). This is because Kjkl is only used to classify if the event is a cloud enhancement or not 463 (piece-wise breakpoint). Moreover, if a less accurate CSI models is used, and it uncertainty is 464 well known, the user can just readjust the offset of the breakpoint (1.05*'\u0000(). 465 Acknowledgments 466 The authors wish to express their gratitude to CAPES (Brazilian Federal Agency for 467 Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education) for partially funding the present work 468 through a scholarship from Allan R.
