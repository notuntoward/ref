Prior literature is largely inconsistentin determiningthe impact of advertisement tone, but separating negative advertisements into two subcategories, advertisements that attack an opponent and advertisements that contrast between oneself and one’s opponent, clearer correlations become evident. Literature suggests that attack advertisements are more effective at generating voter responsiveness and mobilizations compared to contrast advertisements, they also come witha backlash effect that often damages the attacker more than the target. Thus, candidates with a higher percentage of attack advertisements should have a lower vote share, and contrast advertisements should generate mixed results. Using data from the Wesleyan Media Project and the MIT ElectionLab, itwas clear based on a linear regression test that contrast advertisements instead of attack advertisements showed a more significantrelationshipbetween percentage and vote share. However, while the relationshipbetween contrast percentage and vote share was statistically significant,the relationshipbetween attack percentage and vote share was not. 2 Introduction Electionseason isrightaround the corner when campaignadvertisementsstart increasing infrequency. Every two years, when elected officialsat the local, state, and federal levels are up for re-election,itisnearly impossibleto escape the repetitivenumber of messages when sitting down to watch television.The large amounts of televised advertisements are a big part of the mobilizationstrategiesof campaignsand are intendedto help a candidatewinan election. Given that there are so many advertisements run by these campaigns over a relatively short timespan, itisclear that not all of these advertisementsare alike,despitesome of the cliché and satire attached to their uniform layout. A notable categorization that campaign advertisements can be separated by is their tone. On the surface, it is easy to watch an advertisement and immediately tell whether it is meant to highlightthe achievements and positiveattributes of a candidate or unleash a scathing critiqueof an opponent. Yet while scholars have generally used thisseparationof positiveor negativeadvertisementsto analyze the effect that tone has on a candidate’s success, this simple categorizationhas produced wildly inconsistentand sometimes contradictory results. The purpose of my research isto expand the categories of tone, specifically looking at negative advertisements, in order to find more consistentfindingsand relationshipsbetween negativeadvertisementsand vote share. Just as not all advertisements are alike, not all negativeadvertisementsare alikeeither. While some advertisementsdo nothingbut attack the opposition,others includea semblance of positivityby contrastingthe undesirableattributesof an opponent withthe good qualitiesof the attacker. By separating negative advertisements into attack and contrast advertisements, new facts about the effects that these specifictones emerge. Two major findingsfind that attack advertisements have a greater strength of mobilizationand create more responsivenessamongst 3 voters as compared to contrast advertisements, but attacks can quickly lead to backlash which can do more damage than good for an attacker (Fridkinand Kenny 2004). These two facts have led me to hypothesizethat candidates who run a highpercentage of attack advertisementswill experience a lower vote share, but candidates who run a high percentage of contrast advertisements can experience both a high and low vote share based on external factors,not on the tone of the advertisement. Using data accrued by the Wesleyan Media Project, I obtained variables showing the percentage of advertisementtone for each Senate candidatein2016. I crossed these percentages into a dataset containing vote share acquired from the MIT Election Lab. Upon creating scatterplots showingeach candidateshowingtheirattack and contrast advertisementpercentages compared with their vote share, I used a linear regression test to see how both independent variables affect vote share. These results for these tests were unanticipated,as although both attack and contrast advertisements had a negativecoefficient,the rate of declinefor vote share was greater for contrast advertisements. Additionally, the relationship between contrast advertisementsand vote share was statisticallysignificant,but the same could not be saidabout the relationshipbetween attack advertisementsand vote share. As a result, itcould be concluded that either the results were correct, meaning that candidates are more aware of the backlash theory and only run attack advertisementsincertainsituations,or more research could be done with a greater sample size.Despite the initialinaccuracyof the hypothesis,the research shows that more work can be done to further categorize campaign advertisements to find clearer relationshipsbetween advertisementtone and candidatesuccess. 4 Literature Review The Problem With“Negative” Advertisements There is an extensive amount of prior research regarding the impact of campaign advertisements and their tone. Generally, researchers in the past who investigatedpolitical advertisementscategorizedthe tone of an advertisementas eitherpositiveor negative,whichare designedto promote oneself or attack an opponent, respectively. However, the results shown by variousexperimentsspecificallypertainingto the politicaleffects of negativeadvertisementsare inconsistent,to put itlightly. Kahn and Kenny (1999, 887) suggested that “negativeinformation ishelpful and motivatesparticipationas long as itaddresses relevant topicsand ispresented inan appropriatemanner, based on theirresults. They argue that negativeads can potentiallyincrease turnout, as they not only present a higher sense of urgency to potential voters, but they also convey a more stimulatingor excitingmessage than a positivead (Kahn and Kenny 1999). On the other hand, Malloy and Pearson-Merkowitz (2016) examined the effects of positiveand negative advertisingand found that negativeadvertisements“do not appear to be effective,and they (negative advertisements) even seem to have the opposite effect to what the campaign intends”(Malloy and Pearson-Merkowitz2016, 9). Then there isthe evidencepresented by Lau et. al. (2007), who argued that negative advertisementsdon’t help or hurt candidatesany more than positiveones do. Simply put, comparing advertisements based on whether their tone is negativeor positivehas yet to produce consistentresults, or at least results that are agreed upon by scholars as presented thus far. Contrastor Attack During the 2020 Colorado Senate election, Democraticchallenger and former governor John Hickenlooper addressed allegations of running mainly negativeadvertisementsby stating 5 that they were not purely negativebut were contrast advertisements.Hickenlooperstated, “Here are what I call contrast ads where you’re justsaying,‘Hereare the facts, here’s what thisperson stands for, here’s what I stand for, here’s what thisperson saidthey were goingto do, and here’s what they did’” (Ashby 2020). Contrast advertisements, generally those that compare the negative aspects of an opponent with the positives of the broadcaster, separate negative advertisementsby distinguishingbetween advertisementscontainingboth a positiveand negative tone and those withonly a negativetone. Thisallows for advertisementspreviouslyclassifiedas just negative to be split up into contrast and attack advertisements, respectively. Contrast advertisements, when practically applied, change the way an election is portrayed through the advertisementscandidatesrun. When reviewingadvertisement data from the 2000 Presidentialelection,Goldsteinand Freedman (2002) saw that when advertisementswere categorizedpurely intopositiveor negative categories, the percentage of negative advertisements exceed the percentage of positive advertisements, but when incorporatingcontrast advertisementsas a thirdcategory, the number of positiveadvertisementswas essentiallysplitinhalf, withone-quarter of all advertisementsrun being classifiedas contrast advertisements. The incorporationof contrast advertisements in Goldstein and Freedman’s research (2002) shifted the perception of the election from being overly negativeto fairlypositive. Goldsteinand Freedman (2002) continuedto use the contrast advertisements as an additionalcategory to test several variables such as competitivenessand timing,and also found that the results from these tests were vastly different than the results from tests simply comparing positiveand negative tone. This shows that the separation of negative advertisementsintothe categoriesof contrast and attack can drasticallyshiftthe way an election 6 isperceivedthrough itsadvertisingand isa validdistinctionto make when conductingcampaign advertisementresearch. Sincescholars have been unable to create a common understandingregardingthe impact of negative advertisements on measures of campaign success, then narrowing down negative advertisementsby separatingthem intoattack and contrast advertisementsshould yieldstronger correlationsbetween advertisementtone and measures of candidatesuccess. Fridkinand Kenny (2004) examined negative advertising’s effects on voters’ responsiveness. For one of their experiments, they compared contrast advertisements with attack advertisements, to see which one would generate more of a response and found that attack advertisements,whether employed by an incumbent or challenger in Senate elections, were more effective at changing a voters’ opinion (Fridkin and Kenny 2004). While attack advertisements were more effective at generatingattentivenessto the issuespresented by an advertisement,researchers also found that changes in opinioncaused by attack advertisements were not always to the benefit of the candidaterunningthe advertisement.Fridkinand Kenny (2004) found that candidateswho issue attack advertisementswere more likelyto receivebacklash than those who didn’t issueattacks at all. The backlash caused by attack advertisementscreates adverse effects for candidateswho issuethese advertisements,as shown inadditionalstudies.A survey dividedup participantsand gave each group different transcripts of created by the researchers, with the identityof the candidate who issued the attack being different for each group (Roese and Sande 1993). The results showed that the candidatewho was the target of the attacks receivedmore votes than the candidatewho issuedthem (Roese and Sande 1993). Further, when controllingfor the candidate who was initiallyfavored by the participants,the researchers found that ifthat candidatewas the 7 recipientof an attack, theirvote share didnot decrease, but when they were the issuer, theirvote share declined(Roese and Sande 1993). In another study, Banda and Windett(2016) found that when a candidate issued more attack advertisements relative to their opponent over time, the support shown for them by the public from polling results also declined.The ideaof backlash due to attack advertisementsmakes sense when consideringsurvey data whichreveals that 82% of Americans believe that negative campaigningis underminingand damagingour democracy (Lipsitzet. al. 2006, 338). While attack advertisements have been shown to attract more responsivenessthan contrast advertisements,there isalso a much larger riskof a backlash effect causingnegativeresponsivenessto the attackingcandidate. Vote Share Vote share, or the percentage of votes received,isone of the two most used measures of candidate success alongside voter turnout, but for the purposes of measuring the effect of campaignadvertising,itisthe better variable.Thisisshown by research conducted by Spenkuch and Toniatti(2018), who found differences between the effects of advertisingon turnout and vote share. The authors conclude that voter turnout, when controlling partisan factors, is not significantlyimpacted by political advertisements. This is because the mobilizingand demobilizingcharacteristicsof the tone and other factors of the advertisementscancel each other out in most situations, and as the authors note, is the reason why many studies found inconclusiveand contradictoryresults (Spenkuch and Toniatti2018). However, the authors assert that advertisements can affect vote share by influencingthe “right”constituency to the polls, such as strong partisansand the politicallyinformed(Spenkuch and Toniatti2018). 8 Theory and Hypothesis Based on these findings,I want to look at how politicaladvertisements that contain contrasts and attacks affect vote share. While advertisements categorizedas being positiveor negative have seemingly impacted vote returns as well as other variablesmeasuringcandidate success in varying ways, dividingnegative advertisements between contrast and attack advertisements generates more accurate implicationsof advertisement tone in the real world. This method combines the above findingsby showing that the advertisementscontainingonly attacks consistentlydraw more attentionfrom voters but also have a higherbacklash effect that declines both voter support and vote share. I believe using vote share as a dependent variable will provide clearer correlations than voter turnout and is thus the ideal measure of candidate success when discussing campaign advertisements. After calculating the percentage of advertisements containingattacks for each candidateand comparingthe resultingdata withthe candidate’s vote share, I argue that the backlash effects of the attack advertisementswillcreate a negativecorrelationbetween the two variables. I hypothesizethat Senate candidateswitha higherpercentage of attack advertisementswillhave a subsequently lower vote share, and that the relationshipbetween contrast advertisementsand vote share willbe insignificantand sporadic. Data Methods There are a multitudeof politicalofficesand electionyears to choose from as a case, but I will be using the US Senate elections of 2016 to test my hypothesis. The reason I chose the 9 Senate instead of another politicaloffice is because of the media market from which Senate advertisements are broadcasted. Ansolabehere, Snowberg, and Snyder (2006) provide a good explanationfor this,stating,“Senators and governors receivemore free mediacoverage than do U.S. House members, and they spend more on paid televisionadvertisements during election campaigns. It is also much easier to identifyin-state and out-of-state media markets than in-districtand out-of-districtmarkets” (Ansolabehere, Snowberg, and Snyder 2006, 484). I chose Senate elections over gubernatorial ones as there was simply a larger sample size of Senate candidatesup for electionduringthe year 2016. To test my hypothesis, I will use data from the Wesleyan MediaProjectas well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Election Data and Science Lab. The Wesleyan Media Project (WMP) is a database housing informationon campaign advertisements aired from all levels of government (Fowler et. al. 2019). The WMP collects advertisementsfiledand tracked by Kantar Media’s CampaignMediaAnalysisGroup (CMAG) through a market-based tracking system that providesaccurate informationon how many timesan advertisementwas aired,where it was aired, and what date, time,channel, and show itwas airedon (Fowler et. al. 2019). The system also stores the advertisementsina videofileand presents all the aforementioneddata to the WMP (Fowler et. al. 2019). The Project staff then conduct further research and carefully code the advertisements’video files based on a web-based analysis platform (Fowler et. al. 2019). I use the WMP’s data to gain informationon my independent variable, advertisement tone. To combinethe WMP’s data withthe dataset for vote shares, I findthe percentage of attack ads run by each candidate. To do this, I utilizethe WMP’s civilityvariable listed under “ad_tone”, which reads, “In your judgment, is the primary purpose of the ad to promote a specificcandidate, attack a candidate, or contrast the candidates?” This data is coded by the 10 WMP staff, with “1” representing contrast advertisements, “2” representing promote advertisements, and “3” representing attack advertisements. When crossing this data with the candidate’s name, the total number of each advertisement in each of the above categories is shown for every candidateinthe dataset for whichdata ispresent, along withthe total amount of all advertisements run for each candidate.Thisallows for the percentage of attack and contrast advertisements to be calculated and operationalizedunder the terms “attperc” and “contperc” respectively, and subsequently listedinthe dataset alongsidethe dependent variable. For my dependent variable,vote share, I utilizedata providedby the MIT ElectionData and Science Lab. The Lab (2017) provides informationon vote returns on elections from multiplelevels of government. For my project,I willuse the data set providingstate-level returns for Senate candidates from 1976 to 2020. To find the vote share, I use the variables titled “candidatevotes”, showingthe amount of votes the Senate candidatereceived,and dividethem by “total votes” showingthe total number of votes availablefor Senate candidatesineach state. This calculation will be operationalizedas vote share, represented in the data set as vote percentage, or “votperc”. Below, I provide summary statisticstables for both the independent variables as well as the dependent variable,followed by a linearregressionto findwhether the relationshipbetween the two independent variables and the dependent variable follows the hypothesis,as well as comparingthe statisticalsignificancebetween the two. Statistics Below is the descriptivestatisticstable (Table 1) for the two independent variables, contrast and attack percentage, and the dependent variable, vote percentage. Note that mean, minimum, and maximum are all percentage values and not totals. While initially, only 63 candidates had available data from both data sets, 6 candidateswhose vote share was under 10 11 percent were removed, as they greatly skewed the data. There remainseveral outlierswhose vote share was under 20 percent, but inorder to preserve a meaningfulsample sizeand not ruinthe integrityof the data by removing certain major party candidates, they are stillincludedinthis experiment. Table 1. DescriptiveStatistics Variable Observations Mean Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum Contrast% 57 26.3442 27.0422 0 100 Attack % 57 9.8008 15.3491 0 68.7434 Vote Share 57 48.1387 14.3686 10.2155 78.4780 On average, 26 percent of candidateadvertisementswere contrast advertisements,and 9 percent were attack advertisements. This would seem to fit with both theories, as while the average amount of contrast advertisements is relativelylow, fittingwiththe lack of mobilizing power and vague rhetoric,yet itisstilllarger than the average amount of attack advertisements ran at 9 percent, fittingthe fear of backlash theory. Despitethis,the range of contrast and attack percentages is large, as several candidates chose not to run contrast advertisementsand others chose not to run any attacks. Yet, some candidatesran nothingbut contrast advertisements.For example, 70 percent of one candidate’s advertisements, Patty Judge (D) of Iowa, were attacks. This discrepancy in range could be due to several outsidefactors such as race competitiveness but should stillresult inthe same impacton vote share. Regardingvote share, the average vote share for Senate candidatesin2016 was around 48 percent. The range of vote shares isalmost as high as the independent variables, with David Fleming (R) of Louisianareceivingthe lowest vote share at just over 10 percent, and John Hoeven (R) of North Dakota receivingthe highest vote share at 78.5 percent. 12 Analysis When examiningFigures1 and 2 below, some noticeableobservationscan be made that immediately call the hypothesis into question. For Figure 1, a scatterplot showing each candidate’s contrast advertisementpercentage crossed withtheirvote share, there isa noticeable linear decline in vote share with an increase in contrast advertisements. While there are some outliers in certain clusters, every candidate who ran contrast advertisements 20 percent of the time or less had over 60 percent of the vote share of theirrespectivestates. On the scatterplot with attack advertisements (Figure 2), there is a much less clear correlation between the independentand dependent variables.One takeaway that was made early on was that I severely overestimated the number of candidates who chose not to run any attack advertisements whatsoever. Whether this is an outlier event for just the 2016 election or whether this is consistent for all Senate elections is unclear, but one potential explanation could be that candidateshave become more aware of the backlash effect and are usingcontrast advertisements as a safer way to carry out attacks. Regardless, only 11 candidateshad over 20 percent of their total advertisements take an attacking tone, with various and inconsistentresults as some candidates had a significantlyhigher vote share than others albeit while running more attack advertisements. Table 2 shows the results of the linearregressiontestingthe effects of attack and contrast advertisements on vote share, and they confirm the suspicionsraised by Figures 1 and 2 regarding the accuracy of the hypothesis. While I predicted that attack advertisements would cause a steeper declineinvote share than contrast advertisementswould, the oppositewas true in thiscase. The coefficientbetween attack advertisementpercentage and vote share was negative, whichdidfollow the hypothesis.For every 1 percent increaseinattack advertisements,a 13 Figure1. Contrast Ad.

However, the relationship between attack percentage and vote share was statisticallyinsignificantat the 0.05 p level. These results depicta possibilitythat the relationshipbetween attack advertisementpercentage and vote share ismuch more erraticthan I assumed. At the same time, contrast advertisements had a negative coefficientwith vote share, which was unanticipated by the hypothesis. For every 1 percent increase in contrast advertisements,a candidatewould likelysee theirvote share decrease by .2352 percent. Thiswas also unanticipatedas an increase,incontrast, advertisementpercentage resulted inan even larger decrease invote share than an increaseinattack advertisementpercentage created. Unlikeattack advertisements, the relationshipbetween contrast advertisement percentage and vote share was statistically significant.These results show a much stronger correlation between contrast percentage and vote share as compared to attack percentage and vote share, and the hypothesisis shown to be not only incorrect,but flippedon itshead entirely. The possibilitythat these findingsare correct certainlyexists,despitethe subversionof expectations based on prior literature. One observation to make specificallywhen comparing Figures 1 and 2 is to note that there was a much higher number of candidates who ran a significantpercentage of contrast advertisements, while negativeadvertisementswere only run over 20 percent of the timeby 11 candidates.thiscould be due to an outlieryear from the normal percentages of advertisements ran, or hiscould also be due to more of an understandingof the backlash effect. It could be possible that candidates only issue a high percentage of attack advertisements when they feel that it is a necessary course of action, such as when a heavy underdog feels it is worth the risk to try and generate greater responsiveness,or when a heavy favorite feels that there isno riskas theirvoter base isessentiallysecured. However, thisisnot 16 entirely supported by Figure 2, as 8 of the 11 candidates who ran over 20 percent of their advertisements with an attacking tone ended up with a vote share between 40 and 50 percent, suggesting a narrow election. If attack advertisements are becoming more infrequent, contrast advertisements could potentially replace attack advertisementsas the mainsource of negativity inpoliticaladvertisements,resultinginthe effect initiallyattributedto attack advertisements I believe it is more likely that further research could show a strong correlationbetween attack advertisements and vote share. One change could be to include a greater sample size. The number of candidatessampled didnot includeevery majorparty candidatefrom the year 2016, as the two datasets used didnot have data on the independentand dependent variablesavailable for each candidate.Unless the backlash awareness theory noted above holds, itislikelythat 2016 could have been an outlieryear for the low average percentages of attack advertisementsran, and that a larger sample of Senate candidates spanning multiple elections could show a much stronger correlation. The same can be said for contrast advertisements, as there is a decent amount of varietyinvote shares depictedon Table 2, as some candidateswitha highervote share also have a higher percentage of contrast advertisements, and a greater sample size could potentially fit the hypothesis. It could also be possible that the correlation exists due to the attackingtone inherentincontrast advertisements,albeitless severe than the correlationbetween attack advertisements and vote share. Regardless, the data gathered from the sample sizewas anticipatedto be enough to strongly prove my hypothesiscorrect, but that didnot end up taking place. Conclusion I set out to findclearer correlationsbetween advertisementtone and vote share, and while my hypothesis has been initiallydisproved, I did end up findingsome interestingcorrelations. 17 The higher the percentage of a candidate’s advertisements were contrast advertisements, their vote share declined at a statisticallysignificantlevel, and a highersubstantivelevel than attack advertisements. While this did ultimately not follow my hypothesis, this was an interesting turnout as itproved that the relationshipbetween contrast advertisementsand vote share ismost likely more significantthan originallyanticipatedoverall. While this doesn’t necessarilymean that contrast advertisementsdon’t generate less responsivenessand don’t mobilizevoters well as stated in the literature, it can be concluded that voters make theirdecisionsempatheticallyless neutral to a contrast tone than what was assumed. However, whileattack advertisementsdidnot show a large substantiveor statisticallevel of significance,itcan be less definitivelyconcluded that this data is representative of the overall trend, as only a small number of candidatesran a significantamount of attack advertisements. In the future, researchers could focus on establishing further categorizations of advertisements when testing for measures of candidate success. The results from this study showed a correlation between contrast advertisements and vote share that both did not meet previous expectations and represented new findings for a more specific categorizationof advertisementtone. Some researchers have focused on other characteristicssimilarto tone such as civilityor issue area, and combiningthese variables with tone could also yield different correlations. Campaign advertisements, as the primary medium of distributingpolitical informationby candidatesduringelections,are likelyto continueto be a heavilyresearched topic and given the expansion of advertisements into mediums such as social media, advertisement tone should continueto be at the forefront of research. Research on advertisementtone and how itaffects voters and electionresults could influencethe future of politicaladvertisements,as we 18 continueto findwhichtones and other factors are the most successful at generatinga highvoter share, turnout, or any other measure of candidatesuccess. 19 Bibliography Ansolabehere, Stephen, Snowberg, Erik C., Snyder Jr., James M. 2006. “Televisionand the Incumbency Advantage in U.S. Elections.” Legislative Studies Quarterly 31(4). http://dx.doi.org/10.3162/036298006X201896.
