Imagine a Congress where politicians of different ideologies work together to passlegislation reflecting what most Americans want. This isn’t hypothetical; it’s how Congress worked for much of the 20th century. There were only two major parties, but each was much more ideologically diverse than today, so deal making and coalition politics were the norm. From Social Security to civil rights to immigration and environmental protection, Congress got big things done. That’s not where we are now. In 2025, American politics is stuck. Voters see little but chaos, as Congress lurches from one self-imposed crisis tothe next. Incumbents get re-elected over and over, and yet the parties fail to pass meaningful legislation on the things that matter most to Americans. It doesn’t have to be this way. To escape our two-party trap, we need a better system of electing people to Congress: proportional representation . Mr. Wegman is a member of the Times editorial board, where he writes about democracy, law and politics. Mr. Drutman is a senior fellow at New America and theauthor of “Breaking the Two-Party Doom Loop: The Case for Multiparty Democracy in America.” Jan. 14, 2025 In early 2020, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive Democratfrom New York, was asked to speculate about her role under a Joe Biden presidency. She groaned. “In any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the sameparty,” she said, “but in America, we are.” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s frustration with the two-party system reflects the frustrationAmerican voters feel every time they step into the voting booth, when they find themselves stuck with the same two choices — and, in most places, only one withany shot at winning. As a new Congress sputters into gear, this rusty binary split — a product of ourantiquated winner-take-all electoral mechanisms — is key to understanding why our national legislature has become the divisive, dysfunctional place it is today. Itis why more than 200 leading political scientists and historians (including one of the authors of this essay) signed an open letter in 2022 calling on the House of Representatives to adopt proportional representation — an intuitive and widelyused electoral system that ensures parties earn seats in proportion to how many people vote for them. The result is increased electoral competition and,ultimately, a broader range of political parties for voters to choose from. In 2024 fewer than 10 percent of U.S. House races were competitive. In a vast majority of districts, one party or the other wins by landslides. Driven by a decades-long geographic sorting that has concentrated Democrats in cities andRepublicans in rural areas and reinforced by partisan gerrymandering, this split electoral landscape has fostered a polarized climate that becomes more entrenchedwith each election. The heart of the problem is the system of single-winner districts, which give 100percent of representation to the candidate who earns the most votes and zero percent to everyone else. Winner-take-all is the electoral software that generates two dominant parties and relegates third parties to playing the role of spoiler and wasting theirsupporters’ votes. This leads to the same high-stakes contest every two years between the same two parties, resulting either in domination by one or in dividedand paralyzed government by both. The winners push through as much of their agenda as they can while they holdpower. Losing parties often refuse to work with the other side. In less polarized political times, winner-take-all systems can do a decent job ofreflecting public opinion and maintaining democratic stability, but when a nation is deeply divided and large numbers of people fear that they will not berepresented at all, the result is an erosion of trust in government and rising extremism and political violence. As the political scientist Barbara F. Walter has observed , a majority of civil wars over the last century appear to have broken out in countries with winner-take-all systems. No democracy can survive long in the face of this much division and distrust. It’s hardly surprising, then, that more than two-thirds of Americans want to see major changes in our political system. Roughly the same proportion wish they had more than two parties to choose from. They’re right: Two parties competing in winner-take-all elections cannot reflect the diversity of 335 million Americans. T h e F i x We ended up here not by any conscious choice. The framers of the Constitutionnever addressed congressional electoral systems. Rather, an election that only one party wins, with a simple plurality, operates as a kind of factory setting for American democracy, one that we have neglected to update, despite radicallychanged circumstances. As a result, we feel trapped by a system we backed into without thinking much about it. But what if we aren’t trapped? Most established democracies already use proportional representation. The switch from winner-take-all to proportionalelections has been the most common major electoral system change among democracies in recent decades. Here’s how it would work in the United States: That’s proportional representation. Voters vote as they do today, but because districts have multiple members rather than single members, it allows severalcandidates to win seats without a majority of the votes. When the winning threshold goes down, the number of viable parties goes up. So multiple candidatesfrom multiple parties can represent a district, giving millions more Americans the opportunity to vote for a winning candidate, whether that candidate is aRepublican or a Democrat or a member of another party. This brings us closer to the vision of founders like John Adams and James Madison,who both warned against the dangers of two dominant parties (or factions). As Adams wrote in 1776 , Congress “should be in miniature, an exact portrait of the people at large. It should think, feel, reason and act like them.” What would that look like in 2025? How many parties would there be? To find out,we analyzed data from Nationscape, a large survey that polled hundreds of thousands of Americans on their political preferences. We used those answers todistribute voters among six hypothetical parties. Source: Nationscape Offering Americans a choice among multiple parties doesn’t just give them a clearer voice in how and by whom they are governed; it also opens up possibilitiesfor new political coalitions, which can in turn lead to the passage of broadly popular legislation . Our politics may seem intractable today, but on issues from gun control to immigration to education reform to A.I. regulation, winning coalitions are hiding in plain sight. It also works better with bigger legislatures, but the U.S. House has been locked at its current size for more than a century. From the beginning of the House in1789 until the early 20th century, its membership grew roughly in line with the U.S. population. At the start, there were about 34,000 constituents perrepresentative; by 1911, that number had grown to more than 200,000 — much larger than the founders intended but still manageable. Today the average district holdsmore than 760,000 people, which is far too big for any one representative. As a result, tens of millions of Americans are represented by House members they did not support and in a highly polarized environment that leaves people feeling that they are not represented at all . The fix for this problem is to expand the membership of the House of Representatives to reflect the size and diversity of the U.S. population in the 2020s rather than the 1920s. According to many political scientists, the optimal total number of members of the House and the Senate combined is equal to the cuberoot of the nation’s population. Legislatures in democracies around the world roughly align with this ratio; the U.S. House did, too, until its size was frozenby law at 435. Today the cube-root rule would give us a House with 593 members. To see how these reforms would work in practice, consider Massachusetts: A map showing the congressional districts of Massachusetts, both before and after the introduction of proportional representation. Massachusetts currently has nine seats in the House. All of them are filled by Democrats, even though more than one in three voters cast a ballot for DonaldTrump in November. In an expanded House with proportional representation, Massachusetts would have 13members, divided into three districts of four or five representatives each. Sources: Nationscape; Redistricter Not only would right-leaning voters in Massachusetts get federal representation, but the candidates they would help elect would most likely differ from right-leaning candidates elected in Florida or Wyoming. The same is true of the state’s liberals and progressives, who would most likely elect different candidates fromthose in Texas or Nevada. If proportional representation was used nationally, it would recreate theideological diversity that is currently suppressed by the two-party system. To see a picture of how that could play out with multimember House districts, we usedRedistricter , a mapping application for analyzing political and demographic data. Here’s what it might look like.

It would also effectively eliminate partisan gerrymandering and most likely increase representation of racial, ethnicand religious minorities. In all, it would be a better way to run one of the largest and most diverse countries on the planet. E i g h t W o r d s Many Americans believe the two-party system is inherent to the Americanconstitutional design. But the nation’s framers didn’t intend it, nor is it found anywhere in the Constitution. Rather, the shape of the House of Representatives ismandated by a mere eight words of federal law , which requires “no district to elect more than one representative” — 435 districts, 435 members. The law as it exists today was passed in 1967, to address concerns that white- dominated Southern states would exploit multimember districts to marginalize theirBlack voters, but versions of it have been in effect since 1842. Before then, states regularly used multimember districts to elect their congressionalrepresentatives. None of those multimember districts, however, have ever been proportional. All used a form of bloc voting — a majoritarian system in whichvoters can support as many candidates as there are seats, making it impossible for minority-supported candidates to win. But under proportional representation, blocvoting is impossible because each voter gets a single vote. That’s another thing about proportional representation: As a voter, you wouldn’tdo anything substantially different from what you do now. You’d receive your ballot and pick the candidate you wanted to represent you in Washington. Whatwould be different is that you would have more candidates and parties to choose from, and seats would be awarded in proportion to each party’s total vote share ina multiwinner district. The winners could be reported right away. No new voting machines or procedures would be required. And the law could be changed to allow for proportional representation tomorrow. C a n T h i s A c t u a l l y H a p p e n ? Any big electoral reform raises big questions. First, if Congress is already dysfunctional with two parties, why would it work better with five or six? The quick answer is that Congress would do what everyother multiparty legislature in the world does — build a majority governing coalition out of multiple parties . Party leaders would negotiate to assemble their coalitions and allocate leadership roles and committee posts to reflect thebargains they’ve made. If, for example, the 2026 election were held under proportional representation,the Democratic Party coalition might reorganize into three parties competing separately for seats in Congress — the Progressives, the New Liberals and the NewPopulist Party. Each party could appeal to different constituencies, including many that currently feel ignored or alienated by the two-party system. Byspreading out responsibilities, Congress could operate in a more decentralized, committee-oriented manner, with the House speaker playing a less powerful role.This is how Congress operated in the mid-20th century, a more fluid era. Elections for the Senate and the presidency would remain as they are. But with amultiparty legislature, we would expect coalitions of multiple parties around the strongest presidential candidates, with cabinet appointments that reflect thewinning coalition. This combination has proved durable in many countries. And contrary to popular belief, we wouldn’t have to move to a parliamentary systemof government. Most countries with presidential systems use proportional representation to elect their legislatures. The United States is one of only fourstable(ish) presidential democracies in the world that use a winner-take-all system to elect their legislature. The other three are Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone . Would sitting members of Congress ever approve these reforms? Many of them agreethat their institution is not working. Interviews with retiring members show just how dysfunctional, chaotic and difficult Congress has become — and why so manyrepresentatives now call it quits after a short time in office . It’s not surprising, then, that calls for reform are starting to come from insidethe House. In November, Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Democrat of Washington, and Representative Jared Golden, Democrat of Maine, proposed establishing a select committee to examine electoral reforms, including proportional representation and House expansion; last week they reintroduced it as a top priority in the new Congress. Meanwhile, incumbents who fear losing their jobs should expect to be re-elected under proportional representation, since theywould benefit from the advantage of being well known. A more serious obstacle is the leaders of the two dominant political parties, whoare unlikely to support reforms that weaken their power. Then again, party leadership has been described as the worst job in America. And elected leaders do sometimes support significant reforms when voters become so disillusioned that they demand them. Most of us, politicians and voters alike, have spent our whole lives in this broken system. But imaginations can expand, and conditions that seem unchangeablecan change. They often do in a crisis like the one we are living in now. This is a rare moment of openness to reform , combined with and triggered by the dysfunction in American politics. We should seize it. M e t h o d o l o g y To create the six new hypothetical parties, we built indexes that capture the policy views of Americans along economic and social dimensions. The data are fromNationscape, a nationally representative survey of several hundred thousand people fielded between 2019 and 2021. The economic index we created includes positions on issues related to health care, the minimum wage, environmental policy, trade and taxes. The social index includespositions on issues like abortion, gun policy and immigration, as well as gender, racial and cultural attitudes. We then defined the positions of six new hypothetical parties along those economic and social dimensions and matched each respondent to the party that most closelyaligns to her or his preferences. New multimember districts were drawn to accommodate an expanded House of 593members. The seats in those districts were allocated based on state population. For simplicity, no district has more than six seats. In states with fewer than sixHouse seats, the entire state is covered by one district. We then placed respondents into their new multimember districts and counted howmany supporters each party had in each district. We treated the number of party supporters in each multimember district as votesfor that party and used those votes to figure out how many seats the parties won in each multimember district. Proportional representation systems use differentformulas to translate votes to seats. For this exercise, we used a formula first developed by Daniel Webster that tends to facilitate the representation of smallparties.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
