Introduction Currently, coal supplies about 75% of the total energy consumption in China [1], and this level of energy consumption causes a series of environmental pollution. With the rapid development of the Chinese economy, the energy consumption has increased considerably, and this has increased pressure on energy production. In turn, this pressure has greatly assisted in the development of the renewable energy in the past three decades. Since 1980, the utilization of solar water heaters has been rapidly expanded with an annual average growth of 30%[2]. In practical applications, it is essential to estimate monthly average ∗ To whom all correspondences should be addressed.

Yuqin Yang et al. / Energy Procedia 16 (2012) 1570 – 1578 1571Author name / Energy Procedia 00 (2011) 000–000 daily collectible radiation on an inclined surface. To do such work, the key task is to estimate the daily collectible beam radiation on a tilted surface, and the most commonly used method is to calculate the ratio of daily collectible beam radiation on a tilted surface to that on the horizon, Rb, first, then calculate the daily collectible beam radiation based on the ratio and daily horizon beam radiation [3]. Obviously, for a surface with given orientation, the daily value of Rb is related to the time variation of incidence beam radiation, and the intensity of which on the ground level is a function of atmospheric transmittance. Currently, the widely used method to estimate Rb is the one suggested by Liu and Jordan who developed a simple mathematical expression of Rb by assuming that the incidence beam radiation is a constant, namely, there was no atmosphere over the earth [4]. The objective of this work is to examine the reliability of such method based on the radiation model of Collares-Pereira and Rabl, and radiation predicted under clear sky situation. 2. Mathematical procedure for calculating collectible radiation on tilted surfaces Daily collectible radiation on a solar panel with the azimuth angle φ measuring from due south to the west and tilt angle β from the horizon at any moment can be calculated by summing the contribution of the beam radiation, component of sky diffuse radiation, and the radiation reflected from the ground as follows: ∫ − = 0 0 cos)( t t bT dtfIH θθ +HdRd+ ρ Hh(1-cos β )/2 (1) where Hd and Hh are the daily sky diffuse and hemispherical radiation on a horizontal surface, respectively; Rd stands for the ratio of the daily sky diffuse radiation on a tilted surface to that on a horizontal surface, and is determined by the distribution of sky diffuse radiation over the hemisphere; θ is the incidence angle of solar rays on the tilted surface; and Ib is the instantaneous beam radiation intensity on a surface normal to the radiation; )(θf is a control function, being 1 for the case of cosθ >0 otherwise zero. To be convenient for calculations, the expression in the above is usually expressed by: HT=(Hh-Hd)Rb+ HdRd+ ρ Hh(1-cos β )/2 (2) where Rb is the ratio of daily beam radiation on a tilted surface to that on the horizontal surface and expressed by: ∫∫ −− = 0 0 0 0 coscos)( t t zb t t bb dtIdtfIR θθθ (3) where zθ is the zenith angle and determined by [5]: cos zθ =sin λ sinδ +cos λ cosδ cosω (4) where λ is the site latitude, ω is the hour angle in radiant measuring from the solar noon, δ is the declination of the sun and determined by day number, n, counted from the first day of a year as follows: sinδ = -sin23.45cos[360(n+10)/365.25] (5) The incidence angle of solar rays on the tilted surface,θ , is expressed by [5]: cosθ =cos β cos zθ + cosδ sinω sinφ sin β +sin β cosφ (cosδ cosω sin λ -sinδ cos λ ) (6) Knowing time variations of Ib in a day, Rb can be numerically calculated. However, the time variation of Ib is not available in most places of the world, thus, Rb has to be estimated based on radiation models. 1572 Yuqin Yang et al. / Energy Procedia 16 (2012) 1570 – 1578Author name / Energy Procedia 00 (2011) 000–000 2.1 Estimating Rb based on extraterrestrial radiation As the simplest method, Liu and Jordan assumed that the radiation intensity Ib is a constant in all time of a day, namely, there was no atmosphere over the earth, and in this case, Rb can be obtained by integrating Eq.3 from the apparent sunrise to sunset on the tilted surface as follows: Rb,1=[C1( ssω - srω )+B1(sin ssω -sin srω ) -A1(cos ssω -cos srω )]/(2D1) (7) where A1=sin β sinφ cosδ (8a) B1=(cos λ cos β +sin λ sin β cosφ )cosδ (8b) C1=(sin λ cos λ -cos λ sin λ cosφ )sinδ (8c) D1= 0ω sin λ sinδ +cos λ cosδ sin 0ω (8d) srω and ssω in Eq.7 are the hour angles of sunrise and sunset on the tilted surface, respectively, and 0ω is the sunset hour angle on the horizon. For south-facing surfaces, srω and ssω are determined by: srω =-Min( 0ω , sω ), and ssω = Min( 0ω , sω ) cos 0ω =-tan λ tanδ (9a) cos sω =-tan( λ - β )tanδ (9b) For the case of φ >0 (facing southwest), srω and ssω are determined by: srω =-Min( 0ω , 1ω ), and ssω = Min( 0ω , 2ω ) and for the case of φ <0 (facing southeast), they become: srω =-Min( 0ω , 2ω ), and ssω = Min( 0ω , 1ω ) where cos 1ω =(E1E2+ 1 2 2 2 1 +− EE )/( 2 1E +1) (10a) cos 2ω =(E1E2- 1 2 2 2 1 +− EE )/( 2 1E +1) (10b) E1=cos λ /(sinφ tan β )+sin λ /tanφ (10c) E2=tanδ (cos λ /tanφ -sin λ /(sinφ tan β )) (10d) 2.2 Estimating Rb based on radiation predicted under clear sky situation For clear sky, Ib can be simply predicted by Hottel model as follows [6]: Ib= bI τ0 (11) where I0 is the solar radiation intensity on an extraterrestrial surface normal to the radiation and determined by the day number, n, counted from first day of a year: I0=1373[1+0.033cos(2π n/365.25)] (12) and the atmospheric transmittance bτ can be expressed by: bτ =a0+a1exp(-k/cos zθ ) (13) Yuqin Yang et al. / Energy Procedia 16 (2012) 1570 – 1578 1573Author name / Energy Procedia 00 (2011) 000–000 where * 000 ara = , * 111 ara = , *krk k= . For the atmosphere with 23km visibility, 0r =0.97, 1r =0.99, kk =1.02, and * 0a , * 1a and *k are determined by: * 0a =0.4237-0.00821(6-A)2 (14a) * 1a =0.5055+0.00595(6.5-A)2 (14b) *k =0.2711+0.01858(2.5-A)2 (14c) In the above, A is the altitude from the sea level in kilometers. By substituting above expressions to Eq.3, one can obtain Rb,2 by direct numerical integration over a day. 2.3 Estimating Rb based on monthly horizontal radiation Given monthly horizontal radiation for a month, the monthly average daily horizontal radiation, Hh, can be simply calculated by dividing the monthly value by days of the month, and the monthly average daily diffuse radiation, Hd, can be estimated by the correlation suggested by Collares-Pereira and Rabl [7] as follows: )]9.0(2cos[)]2/(261.0505.0[ )2/(347.0755.0/ 0 0 −−+− −+= m hd K HH πω πω (15) where Km=Hh/H0, is the monthly average atmospheric clearness index for the month, H0 is the monthly average daily solar radiation on an extraterrestrial horizontal surface and calculated by the following expression: H0= dayτ I0cos λ cosδ (sin 0ω - 0ω cos 0ω )/π (16) where dayτ is the day length in seconds. To calculate monthly average daily radiation H0 and clearness index Km as well monthly average value of Rb, the middle day of a given month is taken as the representative day of the month. On obtaining Hd, the instantaneous sky diffuse radiation, Id, and horizontal total radiation, Ih, can be estimated by means of following correlations: ddd HrI = (17a) hhh HrI = (17b) zdhb III θcos/)( −= (17c) dh rbar )cos( ω+= (18a) )cos(sin )cos(cos 000 0ωωωτ ωωπ − − = day dr (18b) )3/sin(5016.0409.0 0 πω −+=a (19a) )3/sin(4767.06609.0 0 πω −−=b (19b) Substituting above expressions into Eq.3 obtains: Rb,3=[(0.5bA2- 'a B2)( ssω - srω )+( 'a A2-bB2)(sin ssω -sin srω ) - 'a C2(cos ssω - cos srω )+0.25bA2(sin2 ssω -sin2 srω )+0.5C2(sin2 ssω -sin2 srω )]/(2D2) (20) where 'a =a-Hd/Hh (20a) A2=cos β +tan λ cosφ sin β (20b) 1574 Yuqin Yang et al. / Energy Procedia 16 (2012) 1570 – 1578Author name / Energy Procedia 00 (2011) 000–000 B2=cos 0ω cos β +tanδ sin β cosφ (20c) C2=sin β sinφ /cos λ (20d) D2=sin 0ω - 0ω cos 0ω (20e) 3. Results and discussions To calculate monthly average daily values of Rb,1, Rb,2 and Rb,3, middle day of each month is taken as the representative day of its corresponding month, on obtaining Rb, the annual collectible beam radiation on the titled surfaces can be obtained by summing monthly value of each month in a year as follows: Sb,i= ibdh RHH ,)( −∑ (21) To evaluate the accuracy of Liu and Jordan method for estimating annual collectible beam radiation on a tilted surface, the relative deviations of Sb,1 obtained from Liu and Jordan method from Sb,2 and Sb,3 obtained from Rb,2 and Rb,3, respectively, are introduced as follows: 2η =(Sb,1-Sb,2)/Sb,2 (22a) 3η =(Sb,1-Sb,3)/Sb,3 (22b) Monthly horizontal radiation data for calculations in this work was taken from reference [8].

It is seen that in winter months, Rb,1, obtained from Liu and Jordan method, is slightly larger than Rb,2 and Rb,3, whereas in the summer months, the situation is reversed. It is also found that Rb,2 and Rb,3 are almost identical in all months of a year. Effects of tilt-angles on 2η and 3η for south-facing surfaces are presented in Figs. 2 and 3. It is seen that the annual collectible beam radiation on a south-facing tilted surface, Sb,1, predicted by Liu and Jordan method is slightly larger than Sb,2 and Sb,3, for a site with lower latitude such as Kunming, deviations of Sb,1 from Sb,2 and Sb,3 increase with the increase in the tilt-angle; whereas for a site with high latitude such as Harbin, such deviations are kept stable and small for β <60o, and then increase with the increase in the tilt angle. However, deviations of Sb,1 from Sb,2 and Sb,3 are always less than 5%, indicating that Liu and Jordan method is suitable to predict the annual collectible beam radiation on south-facing surfaces with an acceptable accuracy. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 Kunming: λ=25.01 o ; φ=0 o η 2 η 3Relative deviation(%) Tilt angle in degree Fig.2: Effects of tilt-angle of south-facing surfaces on 2η and 3η in Kunming 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 Harbin: λ=45.75 o ; φ=0 o η 2 η 3Relative deviation(%) Tilt angle in degree Fig.3: The same as in Fig.2 but in Harbin 1576 Yuqin Yang et al. / Energy Procedia 16 (2012) 1570 – 1578Author name / Energy Procedia 00 (2011) 000–000 3.2 Comparisons of Rb,1 with Rb,2 and Rb,3 for non south-facing vertical surfaces As seen from Fig.4, the Rb,1 is always larger than Rb,2 and Rb,3 for non south-facing vertical surfaces, furthermore, such difference increases with the increase in azimuth angle. This is because that Rb,1 is obtained based on the assumption of Ib being a constant, but in fact Ib is not a constant and generally decreases with the increase in the distance that solar rays travel through the atmosphere, thus with the increase in the azimuth angle, the distance that solar rays travel through the atmosphere at given moment increase and the actual solar gain will be much less than expected based on the assumption of Ib being a constant. Fig.4: Monthly average daily Rb obtained from different radiation model for non south-facing vertical surfaces Effects of the azimuth angle of vertical surfaces on 2η and 3η are shown in Figs.5 and 6. It is seen that 2η and 3η increase with the azimuth angle, for the case of azimuth angle less than 15o, both 2η and 3η are less than 5%; whereas for the case of φ =90o, they are larger than 20%. This indicates that Liu and Jordan method is only suitable to estimate annual collectible beam radiation on a surface with an azimuth angle less than 15o, otherwise, other method should be estimated employed. 024 68 10 12 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 β=90 o ; φ=30 o Harbin: λ=45.75 o ; A=0.45km R b,1 R b,2 R b,3Monthly average Rb 02468 10 12 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 β=90 o ; φ=70 o Harbin: λ=45.75 o , A=0.45km R b,1 R b,2 R b,3Monthly average Rb Month Yuqin Yang et al. / Energy Procedia 16 (2012) 1570 – 1578 1577Author name / Energy Procedia 00 (2011) 000–000 4.
