Introduction The angle-of-incidence (AOI) is the angle between the normal to the photovoltaic (PV) module surface and the vector of the incom- ing radiation. When the AOI is increased, an increased percentage of the in-plane irradiance is reﬂected from the surface of a PV mod- ule. This reduces the in-plane irradiance reaching the PV cells that generates electricity. To account for this reduction when modeling PV performance, the in-plane irradiance is multiplied by an AOI correction factor (from 0 to 1). The AOI correction factor is the in-plane irradiance reaching the PV cells divided by the in-plane irradiance reaching the PV cells when the AOI is normal to the PV module surface. Other terms for the AOI correction factor include: transmittance for diffuse radiation (Brandemuehl and Beckman, 1980), relative transmittance (Sjerps-Koomen et al., 1996), angular factor (Martin and Ruiz, 2001, 2013), incidence angle modiﬁer (De Soto et al., 2006), and relative light transmission into the module (IEC, 2016). The AOI correction factor may be represented by a function, F(AOI), that provides a relationship with the AOI. The function may be based on indoor or outdoor tests where the short-circuit current output of the PV module or one of its cells is measured over a range of AOIs. Eq. (1) is the Sandia function as formulated by King et al. (2004) as a 5th-order polynomial where the a values are the polynomial curve-ﬁt coefﬁcients: FðAOIÞ¼ a0 þ a1 \u0002 AOI þ a2 \u0002 AOI 2 þ a3 \u0002 AOI 3 þ a4 \u0002 AOI 4 þ a5 \u0002 AOI 5: ð1Þ Eq. (2) is the function as formulated by Martin and Ruiz (2001, 2013) using exponentials where ar is the angular loss coefﬁcient determined from a best ﬁt of the measured data. This formulation is used in the International Electrochemical Commission (IEC) standard 61853-2 (IEC, 2016): FðAOIÞ¼½1 \u0003 expð\u0003 cosðAOIÞ=arÞ\u0004=½1 \u0003 expð\u00031=arÞ\u0004: ð2Þ For PV modules with a ﬂat glass surface, the IEC standard 61853-2 also allows an air-glass model, such as developed by Sjerps-Koomen et al. (1996), to be used in place of measurements. The air-glass model resulted from studies that showed that the air- glass interface dominates the transmittance of radiation relative to normal incidence. Snell’s law is used to determine the angle of refraction in the glass and Fresnel equations are used to determine the reﬂection from the glass surface. From Dufﬁe and Beckman (1991), the reﬂectance at normal incidence, r0, is deﬁned by Eq. (3): r0 ¼½ðn \u0003 1Þ=ðn þ 1Þ\u00042; ð3Þ where n is the index of refraction of the PV module cover material. (For glass, n = 1.526 and r0 becomes 0.0434.) For values of AOI other than for normal incidence, the angle of refraction, AOIr, is deter- mined using Eq. (4) and then the reﬂectance, rAOI, is determined using Eq. (5): AOIr ¼ sin \u00031ðsinðAOIÞ=nÞ; ð4Þ http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2017.03.027 0038-092X/\u0003 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

(6) represents the function, F(AOI), when using the air-glass model to determine AOI correction factors: FðAOIÞ¼ð1 \u0003 rAOIÞ=ð1 \u0003 r0Þ: ð6Þ Both the direct beam and diffuse irradiance may be corrected for the AOI, with the diffuse irradiance classiﬁed by its type: (1) sky—radiation from the sky dome, (2) circumsolar—radiation from the region of the sky near the sun, (3) horizon—radiation from the region of the sky near the horizon, and (4) ground-reﬂected—radia tion reﬂected from the ground. This classiﬁcation of the diffuse irradiances is consistent with the popular Perez transposition model where the sky-dome irradiance distribution has an isotropic background with enhanced circumsolar and horizon regions (Perez et al., 1990). Other transposition models use similar classiﬁcations for diffuse irradiances. Yang (2016) provides a recent summary of available transposition models and their features. The circumsolar diffuse irradiance is considered to have the same AOI as the beam irradiance; consequently, their values of F (AOI) are the same. Their AOI is calculated based on the sun’s posi- tion and the PV module’s azimuth and tilt from horizontal. For the other classiﬁcations of diffuse irradiance, the PV module receives radiation from angles within its 180\u0001 ﬁeld of view. If the radiation is considered isotropic—meaning that the radiation intensity is the same and independent of direction—then radiation from directions with large AOIs contribute less to the in-plane irradiance because the cosine of the AOI is less. A smaller amount of radiation will also reach the PV cells because the value of F(AOI) is also less. Based on the work of Brandemuehl and Beckman (1980), Eq. (7) integrates the effect of the AOI for all angles within the ﬁeld of view to pro- vide an overall AOI correction factor for the diffuse radiation, Fd: Fd ¼ R A FðAOIÞ\u0002 cosðAOIÞdx R A cosðAOIÞdx ; ð7Þ where x is the solid angle of the incident diffuse irradiance and A is the range of x. The radiation’s F(AOI) is weighted by its contribu- tion to the in-plane irradiance. This work provides a method for numerically integrating Eq. (7) to obtain overall AOI correction factors for the sky, horizon, and ground-reﬂected diffuse irradiance components. To aid users in the implementation of the method, pseudo code is provided in Sec- tion 3, and example results for a PV module are provided in Section 4. 2. Numerical method By deﬁnition, the solid angle subtended by an object is the area projected onto the surface of the unit sphere, radius of one, with the vertex of the solid angle located at the center of the unit sphere. The dimensionless unit of the solid angle is the steradian. About a point, the total solid angle is 4p, which is the same as the surface area of a sphere with a radius of one. In Fig. 1, an elemental surface area, dA, of the sky viewed by the PV module is projected onto the surface of the unit sphere. The resulting projected surface area, dAs, equals the solid angle dx. To facilitate calculating values of dAs, the /–w coordinate system shown in Fig. 2 is used to deﬁne dAs, where / is the angle between the zenith and a line from the center of the sphere to the dAs and w is the angle from north for a line from the center of the sphere to the vertical projection of the dAs in the horizontal plane. From ele- mentary geometry, the surface area of dAs may be calculated using Eq. (8): dAs ¼ðw2 \u0003 w1Þ\u0002 ½cosð/1Þ\u0003 cosð/2Þ\u0004; ð8Þ where w is in radians and the subscripts deﬁne the range of angles, with a subscript of one corresponding to the minimum angle and a subscript of two corresponding to the maximum angle. Using the average values of / and w to represent the center of the dAs and recognizing that the coordinate system is the same as that used for the sun’s position in the sky, an equation from Iqbal (1983) provides the AOI: Fig. 1. PV module located at the center of the unit sphere showing the regions of the sky and ground within the PV module’s ﬁeld of view, the elemental area, dA, projected onto the unit sphere, and the resulting angle of incidence, AOI, between the projected elemental area, dAs and the normal to the PV module.

Eq. (10) is used for the numerical method and is essentially equivalent to Eq. (7), with dx replaced by dAs and the integrals replaced by summations over the appropriate ranges of / and w that are within the ﬁeld-of-view of the PV module (AOI < p/2) and for when / is valid for the type of diffuse irradiance consid- ered, per Table 1: Fd ¼ P/¼p /¼0 Pw¼2p w¼0 FðAOIÞ\u0002 cosðAOIÞ\u0002 dAs P/¼p /¼0 Pw¼2p w¼0 cosðAOIÞ\u0002 dAs ½AOI < p=2; / from Table 1\u0004: ð10Þ Table 1 lists the valid ranges for AOI and / when implementing Eq. (10) for the different types of diffuse irradiances. Although the horizon diffuse irradiance is considered to be from the horizon (/ = p/2), a half degree above the horizon is included to provide sufﬁcient data for the numerical method (89.5\u0002p/180 \u0005 / \u0005 p/2). As a check on the implementation of Eq. (10), it is useful to rec- ognize that the denominator divided by p is the numerical approx- imation of the conﬁguration factor, CF. The CF is the fraction of energy leaving a surface that is received by another surface. For our application, the energy leaving a surface is the sky, horizon, or ground-reﬂected diffuse irradiance. The receiving surface is the PV module. The mathematical solution for the CF is (1 + cos b)/2 for the sky irradiance and (1 \u0003 cos b)/2 for ground-reﬂected irradi- ance (Iqbal, 1983). Comparing the denominator of Eq. (10) divided by p with the mathematical solution checks the implementation of the method. (The denominator is divided by p because the unit sphere sky dome projected onto the horizontal is equal to p.) Fig. 2.

Results and discussion The pseudo code from Section 3 was implemented to determine the diffuse AOI correction factors for PV modules with two differ- ent types of front surfaces: glass (n = 1.526), and antireﬂection (AR) coated glass (n = 1.3). The air-glass model, Eqs. (3) through (6), was used for the F(AOI) and is also shown in Fig. 3 as the cor- rection factor, Fb, for the beam and circumsolar irradiance. A value of p was used for c, but any value between 0 and 2p provides the same result because the radiation intensity of the sky, horizon, and ground-reﬂected radiation is considered isotropic and therefore not dependent on c. The solution is also valid for both the north and south hemispheres. To show the dependency on b, the correction factor for the dif- fuse sky irradiance, Fsky, the correction factor for the diffuse hori- zon irradiance, Fhor, and the correction factor for the diffuse ground-reﬂected irradiance, Fgrd, were determined for values of b from 0\u0001 to 90\u0001 at 1\u0001 intervals. Fig. 4 illustrates the results for Fsky and Fig. 5 illustrates the results for both Fgrd and Fhor. For Fsky and Fgrd, a value of N equal to 180 was used to set 1\u0001 angular increments for / and w. This permitted the program execution to be completed Fig. 4.

B. Marion / Solar Energy 147 (2017) 344–348 347 within a few seconds and the denominator of Eq. (10) divided by p to be accurate to four decimal places (when compared to the math- ematical solution of (1 + cos b)/2 for the diffuse sky irradiance or (1 \u0003 cos b)/2) for the diffuse ground-reﬂected irradiance). For Fhor, which is evaluated for a 0.5\u0001 band at the horizon, a value of N equal to 1800 was used for angular increments of 0.1\u0001. As expected, the AR-coated glass exhibits better AOI characteristics. As shown in Fig. 4, Fsky has a small dependency on b. This con- trasts with Fhor and Fgrd in Fig. 5 which shows a large dependency on b and approaches zero as b approaches zero. In Figs. 4 and 5, the symbols represent the resulting data from the numerical solu- tions performed at values of b, and the solid lines are polynomial curve ﬁts of these data. To more readily determine a value of Fsky, Fhor,or Fgrd for a value of b, the polynomial curves represented by Eq. (11) may be used as a substitute for performing a numerical solution: Fd ¼ a0 þ a1 \u0002 b þ a2 \u0002 b 2 þ a3 \u0002 b3 þ a4 \u0002 b 4 þ a5 \u0002 b 5; ð11Þ where values of an are the polynomial coefﬁcients and values of b are in degrees from 0 to 90. For the two types of PV module front-cover materials considered, Table 2 provides the polynomial coefﬁcients for Fsky, Fhor, and Fgrd. Unlike Fb, values of Fsky, Fhor, and Fgrd only need to be determined once when modeling the perfor- mance of PV modules with a ﬁxed tilt. 5. Summary A numerical method was developed and the pseudo code was presented for solving the integral equation for the AOI correction factor for diffuse radiation incident PV modules. The types of diffuse radiation considered included sky, circumsolar, horizon, and ground-reﬂected. The method allows the use of an F(AOI) determined with the air-glass model, the Sandia method, or the IEC 61853-2 standard. Results when using the air-glass model were shown for PV modules with b from 0\u0001 to 90\u0001, and for both uncoated and AR-coated glass. Diffuse AOI losses were greatest for small PV module tilt angles and for the uncoated glass. To more readily determine a value of Fsky, Fhor,or Fgrd for a value of b, polynomial curves were established for use as a substitute for performing a numerical solution.
