The index was empirically constructed and was presented in the form of a table. It is often useful to have a formula instead for use in interpolation or for programming calculators or computers. The National Weather Service uses a polynomial multiple regres- sion formula, but it is in some ways unsatisfactory. A new model of the THI is presented that is much simpler—having only 3 parameters as compared with 16 for the NWS model. The new model also more closely fits the tabulated values and has the advantage that it allows extrapolation outside of the tempera- ture range of the table. Temperature–humidity pairs above the effective range of the NWS model are occasionally encountered, and the ability to extrapolate into colder temperature ranges allows the new model to be more effectively contained as part of a more general apparent temperature index. 1. Introduction It is well known that the discomfort that is felt in hot weather depends to a significant degree on the humid- ity of the air as well as the actual air temperature. Nu- merous attempts have been made to quantify this ef- fect. An early, commonly used, index was the discom- fort index [DI; also later referred to as a temperature– humidity index (THI)]. This index was empirically obtained by experimentally subjecting a sample of people to varying temperatures and humidities and polling them as to the discomfort they felt. The results were tabulated as numbers ranging from 60 to 100 with a legend indicating the degree of discomfort that a ma- jority of people would feel in various ranges of values (Bair and Ruffner 1977). While these numbers were useful, they were not as descriptive as the well-known wind chill factor that described apparent low tempera- tures taking wind speed into account. In 1979, R. G. Steadman published a new tempera- ture–humidity index based on several previous bio- meteorological studies (Steadman 1979). This index, un- like the previous DI, indicated the apparent tempera- ture that a person would feel relative to a “normal” humidity corresponding to a dewpoint of 14°C. The model that Steadman created was based on five sub- models, some of which had been empirically obtained. He also identified numerous parameters such as a per- son’s build, activity, and clothing along with solar ra- diation and effective wind speed, all of which influ- enced a person’s perception of apparent temperature. In 1984 Steadman refined his model and included the effect of wind chill to produce a “universal scale of apparent temperature” (Steadman 1984). This scale was presented in the form of four tables; one primarily tabulating apparent temperatures at lower tempera- tures taking wind speed into account, another primarily considering the effect of humidity on higher tempera- tures, and two taking into account the incremental warming due to full sunshine. For meteorological reporting purposes, the effect of full sunshine is of limited utility since the exposure to sunshine varies from person to person. The remaining factors: wind chill at lower temperatures and the THI at higher temperatures are regularly reported, and have become familiar to much of the public. In 2001, the National Weather Service (NWS) adopted a new model for the wind chill factor (available online at http://www. nws.noaa.gov/om/windchill/index.shtml), but it has re- Corresponding author address: Dr. Carl Schoen, Dept. of Math- ematics, University of Wisconsin—Eau Claire, 2113 Providence Ct., Eau Claire, WI 54703.

The tabulated values for this model are reproduced in Table 1, where R is relative humidity (%) and T is temperature (°C). Since Americans are more familiar with the Fahren- heit temperature scale, the more commonly seen tables for the THI are given in terms of these. Table 2 illus- trates such a table (World Almanac 2004). Tables like the above are readily available. With a little interpolation, one is able to estimate, to within a degree or two, the heat index for any common tem- perature–humidity combination. On the other hand, it would be convenient to have a formula that would im- mediately return the THI as a function of temperature and either dewpoint or relative humidity. 2. The multiple-regression model The simplest way to obtain such a model is to obtain a least squares fit to the data using a polynomial func- tion in two variables. THI calculators offered by sites such as The Weather Channel use such models.

Application of Eq. (1) to selected values of tempera- ture and relative humidity would produce a table like Table 2. With an additional adjustment to change tem- peratures from Fahrenheit to Celsius, the result is Table 3. Note that the italicized entries in Table 3 have no corresponding entries in Steadman’s table. 3. A new empirical model A standard method of creating a two-variable em- pirical model is to hold one variable constant and, for several values of the fixed variable, attempt to use stan- dard curve-fitting techniques to obtain a model in the other variable. It may then be possible to find a model to fit the variation in the parameters between the mod- els. Attempting to use this technique on the data in Table 1 proved unsatisfactory. One problem is that the data as presented in Table 1 do not describe the essen- tial problem. Relative humidity is the ratio of the actual vapor pressure to the saturation vapor pressure. The latter is a strong function of air temperature. Thus, the two variables in the table are not independent vari- ables. The true independent variables that should be considered are (dry bulb) air temperature and absolute humidity. Absolute humidity is rarely reported but is closely related to the dewpoint, which is reported rou- tinely in Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) surface observations. Dewpoint is the temperature to which a given air parcel must be cooled at constant pressure and constant water vapor content in order for saturation to occur. Dewpoint depends primarily on the absolute moisture content of the air and only weakly upon pressure. One formula for converting tempera- ture and relative humidity to dewpoint is based on the Magnus–Tetens formula (Barenbrug 1974) over the range 0° \u0007 T \u0007 60°C, 0.01 \u0007 RH \u0007 1.00, where T is the measured temperature (°C), RH is the measured rela- tive humidity expressed as a decimal fraction, and D is the calculated dewpoint temperature (°C). The dew- point temperature is D \u0001 b \u0004 \u0001 a \u0002 \u0001 , where \u00052\u0006 \u0001 \u0001 a \u0004 T b \u0003 T \u0003 ln\u0005RH\u0006, TABLE 3.

The uncertainty in the calcu- lated dewpoint temperature is reported to be \b0.4°C. Now fixing any temperature, it is easy to plot the heat index from Table 1 versus the dewpoint. Two represen- tative plots are reproduced in Fig. 1. Each clearly ap- pears to be an exponential curve with a horizontal as- ymptote as the RH becomes very small. This leads to an obvious submodel. Returning to Table 1, we can plot the heat indices at 0% RH against temperature to obtain the asymptote as a function of temperature. A plot of the 0% heat index versus tem- perature (not shown) at first appears to be linear; how- ever that would require the heat index to eventually be greater than the temperature at 0% RH and low tem- peratures. Plotting, instead, the difference between heat index and temperature at 0% RH yields an ap- proximately exponential curve (Fig. 2). This makes sense intuitively since one expects the effects of the humidity on apparent temperature to become negli- gible at low temperature. A least squares fit (R 2 \u0001 0.914) to the data in Fig. 2 yields a function f(T ) given by \u0005T \u0002 HI\u0006RH\u00010% \u0001 f\u0005T\u0006 \u0001 1.0799e 0.037 55T. \u00053\u0006 For each of the heat index versus dewpoint curves ob- tained for each temperature, a least squares exponen- tial can now be obtained. From the determination of the asymptotes from above, each exponential should be of the form HI \u0001 T \u0002 f\u0005T\u0006\t1 \u0002 e \u0002\u0005T\u0006\u0005D\u000214\u0006 , \u00054\u0006 FIG. 1.

The factor (D \u0002 14) in the exponent is due to Stead- man’s assertion that a dewpoint of 14°C should be the baseline in computing apparent temperatures in sultry air. To determine \u000b(T), Eq. (4) is solved for \u000b for each data point in Table 1 for which \u000b is defined, and the results are plotted in Fig. 3. There is no apparent functional relationship between T and \u000b (the linear coefficient of determination is R 2 \u0001 0.0354). Making the assumption, then, that the best es- timate for \u000b is that it is a constant, an initial guess of \u000b \u0001 0.1 is made. The HI is computed for each (R, T ) pair in Table 1, and the differences from the values in Table 1 are tabulated. A second table containing the squares of the differences is constructed, and a spread- sheet solver application is used to minimize the sum of the squares of the deviations in terms of \u000b. The optimal value of \u000b was computed to be 0.0801. The minimized sum of squared errors at this value is given by SSE \u0001 58.3. The maximum error is \u00032.0°Cat T \u0001 48°C and RH \u0001 25%. The resulting table of errors is shown in Table 4. 4.

The current NWS model is given by Eq. (1). A table of deviations from Table 1 using the NWS model is given in Table 5. The purpose of least squares regression is to find the functional relationship that minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors (SSE). One standard method of comparing the fit of two different regression models is to compare the values of SSE. Here, for the NWS model, SSE \u0001 669.8. In addition, the maximum error is \u00035.7°Cat T \u0001 44°C and RH \u0001 40%, and 39 values have absolute errors exceeding the new model’s maximum error of 2.0°C. Each model fits the tabulated data quite well in the center area of the table, but the new model fits signifi- cantly better at the more extreme values (high and low temperatures with higher humidities.) One additional advantage to the new model is that it gives reasonable values when extrapolating out of the range of the data. Temperature–humidity combinations above the range are rarely encountered; however, according to a column from Weatherwise magazine (see online at http://www. TABLE 4.

On 13 July 1995, Appleton, Wisconsin, recorded a tem- perature of 101°F (38°C) with a dewpoint of 90°Fat 1700 LT. That corresponds to a relative humidity of 71%, which is well outside the table values (the new model returns 53.4°C). With increased global reporting of dewpoints (and with increased interest in the very hot and humid Persian Gulf region), it is likely that more such extreme values will be encountered. There is usually little interest in the heat index at temperature–humidity values below the tabulated val- ues, but, by its construction, the new model behaves reasonably at very low temperatures while the NWS model gives very unrealistic values (as can be seen in Table 7). One advantage to this is that, unlike the NWS model, heat index does not have to be “turned off” at some arbitrary point in a more general apparent tem- perature model. For comparison, Tables 6 and 7 show the results of extending the two models over a larger range of temperatures. 5. Conclusions The temperature–humidity index is now ubiquitous, and the current NWS model does not work badly in TABLE 6. Predicted heat indices using the new model. Here R is relative humidity in percent and T is temperature in degrees Celsius. (Values of 100°C or greater are not shown.)

It is simpler, having only 3 param- eters as opposed to 16 for the NWS model. It fits the observed values significantly better (SSE \u0001 58.3 as op- posed to SSE \u0001 669.8). In addition, the new model allows for extrapolation. The ability to extrapolate to lower temperatures follows from the construction of the model, and, as can be seen from Table 6, the model gives reasonable values for all lower temperatures. Ex- trapolation to higher temperatures and humidities is more questionable, but based on comparison of the er- rors on the lower right in Tables 4 and 5, the new model might be expected to extrapolate much more reason- ably than the current model. Last, there is no need to use the Magnus–Teten formula in the case of METAR surface observations. The new model [Eq. (4a)] can be applied directly to METARs, which report temperature and dewpoint in degrees Celsius. REFERENCES Bair, F. E., and J. A. Ruffner, Eds., 1977: The Weather Almanac. 2d ed.
