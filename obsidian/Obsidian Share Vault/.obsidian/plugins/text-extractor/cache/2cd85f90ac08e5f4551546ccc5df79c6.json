Despite the efforts of the energy stor- age industry to improve system safety, recent incidents show the need for a greater recognition of the limitations of current practices. For example, much of the effort has focused on improving safety at the cell and battery pack level. Additionally, risks that manifest during operation and the catastrophic failures arising from operator error or component failures have not received as much attention as the initial factory testing and commissioning of BESSs. This article advocates the use of predictive maintenance of operational BESSs as the next step in safely managing ESSs. Predictive maintenance involves monitoring the components of a system for changes in operating parameters, which may be indicative of a pending fault. These changes signal the need for maintenance while the fault is still recoverable. Many industries, including utilities, use this maintenance approach for assets such as power plants, wind turbines, oil pipelines, and photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, this approach has yet to be fully explored and utilized for BESSs. Predictive monitoring is complementary to and should not replace safer system designs, which are essential for the real-time mitigation of catastrophic failures. How- ever, when applied to BESSs, predictive moni- toring can initiate actions that potentially pre- vent catastrophic failures from occurring.

In 2016, Det Nor- ske Veritas (Norway) and Ger- manischer Lloyd (DNV GL) published the GRIDSTOR Recommended Practice on “Safety, Operation and Per- formance of Grid-Connected Energy Storage Systems.” Other efforts included a col- laboration between the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, SmartDG Hub (led by the City University of New York), and the city of New York (with technical assistance from DNV GL, a testing and consult- ing company) which, in 2018, produced a process guide- book for BESSs: “Permitting and Interconnection Process Guide for New York City Lithium-Ion Outdoor Systems.” At the same time, many organizations were also de - veloping or improving codes and standards to guide the design and installation of ESSs.

UL 9540 (first edition published with the American National Standards Institute in 2015) covers the safety of electrochemi- cal, chemical, mechanical, and thermal ESSs. The document also incorporates ESS equipment for control, protection, power conversion, communication, and fire detection and suppres- sion. UL 9540A (first edition in 2017) created a test method for evaluating thermal runaway fire propagation in BESSs. The effort to develop NFPA 855 began in 2016 as ESS technology usage began to increase due to consumer, business, and government interest. The National Fire Protection Asso- ciation received more than 600 public inputs and 800 public comments during the development process for the document, and the first edition was published in 2019. NFPA 855 focuses on mitigating risk by examining where ESSs are located, how installations are separated, and the suppression systems in place. The document considers ventilation, detection, signage, listings, and the emergency operations associated with ESSs and provides extensive requirements for ESS fire safety. A working group of the International Electrotechnical Com- mission, Technical Committee 120/Working Group 5 Electrical Energy Storage Systems/Safety Considerations, has also devel- oped two standards for integrated systems. IEC TS 62393-5- 1:2017 specifies the safety considerations (e.g., hazards identi- fication and risk assessment and mitigation) applicable to any grid-integrated ESS.

This NLAB Large Chamber is used to test containers up to 53 ft (16 m) in length under controlled thermal and wind velocity conditions (the first facility in the world to do so). The guidelines under development include IEEE Stan- dard P2686, Recommended Practice for Battery Manage- ment Systems in Energy Storage Applications (set for balloting in 2022). This recommended practice includes information on the design, installation, and configuration of battery man- agement systems (BMSs) in stationary applications. The document also covers battery management hardware (e.g., grounding and isolation), software (e.g., algorithms for optimal control), and configuration. More recently, the Modular Energy Storage Architecture (MESA) Standards Alliance, consisting of electric utilities and energy stor- age technology providers, has worked to encourage the use of communication standards and advanced interoperability as well as the reduction of the engineering effort required to inte- grate an ESS into a utility. MESA is developing two standards: one that defines the communication between ESS components and another that defines the communication requirements for utility-scale ESSs. These standards include parameters for inverters, meters, general ESSs, BESSs, and Li-ion BESSs under various operations. Gaps in the Current Approaches to Safety Despite the depth of these collective efforts to understand and mitigate the causes of BESS failure, catastrophic failures continue to occur in the field. In 2019, South Korea initiated a study to determine the leading causes of 23 BESS fires that had occurred since April 2017. The country’s Ministry of Indus- try formed an investigation committee of academics, research institutions, laboratories, and ESS industry experts. In the initial cases examined, cells or battery modules were not believed to be the root cause of the failure. As reported in the press at the time, the investigation identified four main causes of failure: 1) A lack of battery protective systems for electric shock: Systems were not able to properly protect dc contac- tors from the electrical hazards arising from overvolt- age or overcurrent. 2) Insufficient management of the operating environ- ment: Most of the installations were in mountainous or coastal areas. These environments exposed the BESSs to harsh conditions, including large temperature swings and high humidity, that could damage insula- tion and cause fires. 3) Faulty installations: Human error during installation could have led to system faults, resulting in ESS fires. 4) A lack of ESS integrated control and protection systems: Gaps in the integration of the BMS and energy man- agement system (EMS) may have caused the fires. The conclusions of the investigation raise the following question: When it comes to the next stage of failure analysis for ESSs, how can the industry further improve operations to reduce incidents in the field? Some of the issues noted in the South Korea investigation were not captured by standards, and there was no mechanism for identifying and fixing prob- lems or design issues after the installation. Currently, the industry certifies ESSs based on defined sets of codes and standards. This certification focuses on the overall design review of the core ESS, testing for adherence to standards before shipment, and commissioning once the unit is installed in the field. Ideally, the certification process ensures that the overall system design is sound, the factory testing makes certain that the unit was constructed correctly, and the commissioning test confirms that there were no faults created or discovered immediately after the unit was installed at the site. Nevertheless, gaps remain in maintaining the unit after installation and identifying potential failures that may occur in the longer term. In short, there is not much guidance on what to do on day 2 after a project is completed. figure 2.

Restrictions apply. 92 ieee power & energy magazine november/december 2020 Continuous monitoring of the system post-installation is needed to facilitate maintenance and ensure that problems are identified and addressed before they can lead to cascading failures. Systems can be monitored by a BMS, but designs are not standardized, and owners/operators may not have ready access to critical information. Also, the inability of manage- ment systems to “connect the dots” among large quantities of data may cause systems to fail. IEEE P2686 may address some of these gaps. Still, current failure-response mecha- nisms usually lead to total BESS destruction. ESS hazard- mitigation techniques are primarily designed to protect human safety, which certainly needs to be the focus. These responses (e.g., water quenching) will often render the system unrecoverable, making the mitigation just as catastrophic (in a technical sense) as the initial event. Thus, we advocate the development of a framework for the predictive maintenance of operational BESSs as the next critical step in the safe deployment of ESSs. Improving Operations Through Predictive Maintenance Preventive and predictive maintenance are mature concepts for operational systems in industry. Operators complete pre- ventive maintenance on a routine or timed schedule (weekly, monthly, annually, and so forth) based on the average or expected lifetime statistics for equipment. By contrast, pre- dictive maintenance is carried out when needed based on the actual condition of the equipment. Components are monitored for changes in the operating parameters that may be indicative of a pending fault, and these changes prompt intervention. Some organizations have offered general guidance on preventive maintenance for BESSs. For example, an Energy Storage Safety 101 presentation during a May 2020 meet- ing of the California Energy Storage Alliance recommended semiannual steps such as visually inspecting the overall system; examining heating, ventilation, and air condition- ing (cooling); and checking ESS software control and com- munications. An annual process similar to commissioning was also proposed. A 2019 Energy Storage News report on operations and maintenance noted that the Smarter Network Storage Project, a 6-MW/10-MWh battery system, receives a six-month checkup to ensure optimal performance (includ- ing identifying battery degradation levels, pushing software upgrades, and inspecting the power conversion system). In the same report, a representative from an ESS integrator noted that much of their maintenance involved software updates. BMSs implement safety functions and controls that depend on algorithms, sensor data, and system parameters. Furthermore, BMSs and inverters must communicate to coordinate control actions and responses to faults and warn- ings. Therefore, any software or firmware update glitches in either of those components can impact the effectiveness of safety features, leading to potential BMS malfunction and damage to batteries. Periodic software patching also ensures that systems are protected from known cybersecu- rity vulnerabilities. Although helpful, preventive maintenance may be an oversimplification of what is required for maintaining com- plex systems and preventing failures. Here we define a com- plex system as one with many interacting components where it is difficult to comprehensively model all of the behaviors due to the dependencies, relationships, and all other interac- tions between these components. In complex systems, faults are less apparent and may not be visually identified or fixed by a routine procedure. Hence, complex operations for other systems (see Figure 3) often rely on predictive techniques, which are yet to be fully explored for BESSs. Predictive analysis involves understanding how all of the components in a system fail and then actively moni- toring the components for failure criteria. A 2019 report by GlobalData, “Predictive Maintenance in Power,” noted several successful implementations of this approach in the utilities sector.

This resulted in savings of over US$7.5 million. ✔ Southern Company applied predictive analytics to pow- er station models to decrease unexpected maintenance and maintain data quality reliability, resulting in sav- ings of approximately US$4.5 million. ✔ Many wind turbine operators now use predictive analyt- ics to monitor the health of gearboxes. The cost of gear- box failure can be upward of US$350,000 per incident. Despite these and other successes, both business and technical challenges hinder a broader adoption of predictive maintenance in BESSs. From a business perspective, the energy storage industry is relatively young. Thus, business priorities and budgets do not always motivate investment in “soft” engineering methods such as data analytics and arti- ficial intelligence-based services. The nascent state of the industry also means reduced data on fault patterns, especially due to limited public knowledge exchange, making data ana- lytics more difficult. Furthermore, the pressure to keep the cost per kilowatt hour as low as possible means less invest- ment in the sensors and infrastructure needed to process large volumes of data. In terms of technical challenges, predictive maintenance techniques tend to be used for mechanical systems where factors such as “wear and tear” can be readily measured and monitored. For electronic systems, predictive practices may be more difficult to apply. Rather than wear out, elec- tronic components are more likely to have a binary failure profile. An issue with one component may manifest itself downstream and result in the failure of another component, requiring data collection from multiple points to identify a pending failure. Implementing predictive monitoring in conventional BESS hardware is also difficult due to limitations in communica- tion channel availability and the processing power of battery/ energy management devices. In a BESS, predictive monitor- ing would involve processing data from battery racks and the overall system to identify failure indicators. Ideally, the BMS of an energy storage device should have the abil- ity to assist in this area; however, not all current BMSs are designed to recognize faults occurring outside of the imme- diate impacts on the battery itself (e.g., cells and modules) and may not have the throughput to process all the data. Pre- dictive analysis must also depend on data from the EMS to understand the system’s behavior. Current EMSs are often intended for dispatching/controlling multiple grid resources and do not include the necessary monitoring and safety func- tions to manage single or multiple BESSs. EMSs often lack direct communication with BMSs, and any fault detection by the BMS may not get communicated to the EMS, limiting preventive actions from system operators. Current standards have not addressed this issue. A properly designed monitoring approach for operational ESSs will create indicators that can provide characteristics such as those listed in Table 3. The overall goal is clear: identify the indicators of potential faults and preemptively intervene on an operational ESS without making the inter- vention itself a problem. However, the links and causal rela- tionships between faults and indicators and the potential of those early faults to lead to larger faults are not read- ily apparent at this early stage of the BESS industry. Ulti- mately, stakeholders must establish a methodology for iden- tifying the indicator-fault relationships that can be tracked and monitored in these systems. Creating a Predictive Maintenance Approach for BESSs The sophistication of approaches for identifying useful “flags” or fault indicators has evolved substantially. In the most basic, reactive approach, these indicators are based on near misses reported by employees. All data are significant table 3. The key characteristics of indicators for predictive monitoring. Element Description Time element • Days of warning rather than minutes or hours • Not all faults will have long lead times, but anything that can extend the timeframe can minimize destructive failures Actionable warnings • Point to the components that need to be replaced • Allow time for the examination of areas causing the warning to occur Recoverable actions • Safety measures intended to prevent catastrophic failure and threats to human safety can ultimately destroy the unit (unrecoverable) • Recoverable action must have minimal impact on the system The nascent state of the industry also means reduced data on fault patterns, especially due to limited public knowledge exchange, making data analytics more difficult.

Restrictions apply. 94 ieee power & energy magazine november/december 2020 and can be useful in preventing future failures. Hence, we recommend a culture where the reporting of near misses is encouraged. More rigorous approaches involve 1) lever- aging indicator-fault links established during the system- design phase and 2) combining with additional indicator- fault links from the analysis of operational data on fielded systems. The identification of these links is an iterative pro- cess. During the design phase, system integrators develop the product based on institutional or historical knowledge; however, the use cases the system encounters in the field could lead to new fault indicators. Thus, the predictive maintenance approach should be scalable to adapt to new “patterns” with minimal impact on the overall system cost and availability. The following section elaborates on this two-layer approach for identifying indicator-fault relation- ships during the design phase and based on the data analyt- ics for fielded systems. Identifying Indicator-Fault Relationships During the Design Phase It is expensive to retrofit a fielded system. Thus, the first step during the design phase is to make a deliberate decision to sense critical information and obtain as much data as pos- sible to provide insight into various failure modes. Next, the process requires 1) the creation of a comprehensive listing of recoverable battery system faults and the linking of faults to lead- ing indicators. This begins with thoughtful engineer- ing consideration of the system design; however, the designer should complement this consideration with a collection of historical data from key developers, op- erators, and manufacturers. 2) the determination of whether indicators are already being tracked through current BMSs, EMSs, or any plant controllers. 3) the finalization of a list of indicators and criteria to be monitored to reduce the field failures of BESS equipment. This is a beneficial process to leverage, although there may be gaps when new failure modes are identified or the process does not account for the design errors or field/envi- ronmental degradation that could lead to failures. The industry has many well-established processes for sys- tem design, including various probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) approaches (e.g., failure modes and effects analysis, fault tree analysis, and so on) and systems-theoretic process analysis (STPA). It is important to note the nuances from processes created from a system-safety perspective. These processes are rooted in historical data, where the mechanism of a past failure is identified to improve designs and prevent a similar failure from occurring in the future. To contribute substantially to predictive maintenance, however, the sys- tem-design process also needs to establish the monitoring criteria that can be used in maintaining device operation. PRA, built from a foundation of risk management, is the most widely used safety engineering method. A PRA approach identifies hazards, their deterministic causes and consequences, and provides a method of describing uncer- tainty. The process enables the calculation of expected risk (defined as the probability of an event multiplied by the rela- tive severity of its consequences) so that a developer can compare different design options. PRA uses fault and event tree analysis to break a complicated system into subsystems and components when there is insufficient data to directly predict behavior. Risk is then increased or decreased based on how failures in components and subsystems operate together to generate accidents. Additionally, failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a systematic procedure for assessing reliability and how component failures can impact system safety. Developers begin an FMEA by compiling a list of each component or type of component in a system. Then they calculate the prob- ability of each component failing in a variety of ways based on historical data. Table 4 shows a brief list of typical FMEA calculations for a BESS (adapted from an Electric Power Research Institute report on ESS safety). The probability and severity each receive a score of 1–10, with 10 correspond- ing to a more probable or severe event. Each failure mode is linked to a hazard effect, consequence, method of prevention, and method of detection. The identification of the detection method lays the foundation for predictive maintenance. It is apparent, however, that this conventional FMEA approaches system design from a safety perspective (preventing cata- strophic failure) rather than detecting faults while they are still recoverable. The process creates a probability but does not provide the leading indicators necessary to flag pending failures of the areas. Still, these processes are beneficial in understanding what areas to focus on when creating indica- tor-fault relationships. A more recently developed design tool, STPA, views a system as a collection of interacting control loops. Acci- dents happen when the component interactions in these loops violate safety constraints. Unlike PRA-based tools, it does not rely on any component failure rate data. Thus, this During the design phase, system integrators develop the product based on institutional or historical knowledge; however, the use cases the system encounters in the field could lead to new fault indicators.

STPA is conducted in four parts: 1) Identify the accidents and hazards to be prevented in the system. 2) Draw all the control structures in the system. 3) Determine unsafe control actions. 4) Identify causal scenarios, i.e., linkages, between faults. This fourth step can lead to the relevant indicators for pre- dictive maintenance. Rosewater and Williams in the “For Further Reading” section provide a more detailed explanation of this process. Different companies prefer different methodologies during the system-design phase. In the previous section, we provided a few examples rather than recommending a specific approach. Many methodologies are rooted in the (appropriate) foundation of protecting human safety, with hazard-mitigation responses that tend to render the system unrecoverable. Predictive moni- toring accepts that faults may occur through degradation due to long-term operation or from the impact of an external issue that may damage a component. Predictive maintenance requires identifying the cascading chain of faults that leads to failure and specifying which faults are recoverable. Identifying Indicator-Fault Relationships Using Data Analytics on Fielded Systems The second layer of identifying indicator-fault relationships for predictive maintenance involves using field data. During the design phase, developers evaluate the system based on institu- tional or historical knowledge; however, they may not be aware of everything they need to consider. With data analytics, the goal is to process field data and examine them from different perspectives to identify new relationships. The original system design may not have coverage of all the necessary signals, so a developer may need to integrate different data sets to under- stand what is going wrong. Once a developer identifies a new indicator-fault relationship from the postprocessing of field data, it becomes another signal to respond to in real time. Figure 4 offers a case study for developing such a predic- tive maintenance approach from system integrator NEC Energy Solutions. The company first used FMEA during the system-design phase to identify critical components and failure pathways and determine data needs. Their cloud infrastruc- ture enables data collection and storage from BESSs deployed around the world. Historical data from all the sites are used in predictive-analytics algorithms. One algorithm, used to identify anomalies in battery modules, parses historical data from each rack for a site and associates indicators in the rack data (e.g., cell voltages, current, battery capacity, and operation hours) with system operations. These anomalies represent recover- able issues that could potentially lead to nonrecoverable faults. Examples include capacity degradation or a cell short circuit/ thermal runaway that causes a system fire hazard (to date, NEC installations have not experienced any catastrophic events or fire hazards). Notifications about this anomalous behavior prompt further analysis to remove any false positives. If the engineers identify a real anomaly, they place the offending battery rack out of service until the module is replaced. In summary, pre- dictive maintenance has allowed NEC to identify misbehaving battery modules before they trigger safety hazards, negatively impact system availability, or reduce system capacity. The approach has also led to a reduction in maintenance costs by allowing the service team to plan visits more efficiently in each geographic region. Opportunities for Collaboration in Identifying Indicator-Fault Relationships Because the goal of predictive maintenance is to reduce catastrophic outages of ESSs and improve safety, the tools for the process must be available to all BESS operators. The most critical asset is a comprehensive list of indicator-fault relationships. System integrators can identify some of these relationships during the system-design phase; however, substantial data sets for further analytics are not broadly available. In some cases, these data may be considered table 4. An excerpt from a conventional, safety-focused FMEA for a BESS.

The service team was alerted to this pattern, and they reviewed the data closely, subsequently replacing a battery module in this rack. Results Misbehaving battery modules were identified using predictive analytics algorithms before they could trigger safety hazards, negatively impact system availability, or reduce the system capacity. Furthermore, this approach helped the service team plan maintenance visits more efficiently in each geographic region, reducing the warranty costs.

Today, the only public energy storage database (maintained by the DOE) focuses primarily on installations, technologies, and applications of energy storage. Creating a clearinghouse of fault informa- tion and issues is a more complicated request. Thus, we recommend that independent third-party stake- holders create a public database of causal links and fault data that companies can use to enhance predictive-monitoring applications in their systems. This task may be daunting for individuals but may not be as difficult for those organizations dedicated to supporting ESS safety. The safety of first respond- ers is enough of a reason to encourage system integrators and others involved in system maintenance to collaborate in the public process of identifying these causal relationships and leading indicators. Summary and Recommendations In this article, we recommended that the energy storage industry shift to a predictive-monitoring and maintenance process as the next step in improving BESS safety and operations. Predictive maintenance is already employed in other utility applications such as power plants, wind tur- bines, and PV systems. This process complements current BESS codes and standards and also contributes to broad efforts to design safer systems. Such an approach is neces- sary because of the following: ✔ BESS failures are still occurring despite tremendous efforts to mitigate the key faults believed to be the contributing factors in the failures. ✔ When faults do occur, the steps taken to contain the failure (and protect human safety) usually result in the total loss of the unit. ✔ Current standards for BESSs emphasize factory test- ing, commissioning, and emergency response rather than guidance for operation and maintenance. The goal of a predictive process is to identify the indica- tor of a recoverable fault to initiate an inexpensive mainte- nance operation and prevent the initial fault from cascading into a catastrophic failure. However, creating the causal links between end-failure states and their key indicators is a daunt- ing task, especially at this early stage of the BESS industry. This article described how system integrators may establish these links during the design phase and using data analytics on fielded systems. Despite challenges, the benefits of predic- tive maintenance approaches in reducing catastrophic failures and improving safety are too great to ignore. Even today, with companies such as NEC using only their own historical data, the approach is providing great value. Despite this success story, the industry would ultimately benefit from a public/pro- fessional consortium creating a database of all the issues that lead to larger problems/warning signs of failure. This greater transparency would enhance safety without eroding commer- cial competitive advantages.
