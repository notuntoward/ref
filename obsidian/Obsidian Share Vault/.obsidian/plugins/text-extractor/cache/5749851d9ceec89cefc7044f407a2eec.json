Let's explore an example of how the inverse supply curve operates in practice, specifically in the context of electricity markets. 1. Electricity Market Scenario: o Imagine a regional electricity market where power suppliers generate electricity and sell it to consumers. o The market equilibrium price (where supply equals demand) is initially set at $50 per megawatt-hour (MWh). 2. Regular Supply Curve: o Suppose we start with a regular upward-sloping supply curve for electricity. o As the price of electricity increases, more suppliers are willing to produce and sell electricity. o For instance: = At $40/MWh, suppliers offer 1000 MWh. = At $50/MWh (the equilibrium price), suppliers offer 1200 MWh. = At $60/MWh, suppliers offer 1400 MWh. 3. Inverse Supply Curve: o Now, letâ€™s consider the inverse supply curve, which shows the relationship between the price and the quantity supplied. o As prices rise, suppliers adjust their production levels differently: = Ata higher price (e.g., $60/MWh), suppliers are willing to produce and offer less electricity (say, 1400 MWh). = Ata lower price (e.g., $40/MWh), suppliers are willing to produce and offer more electricity (say, 1000 MWh). o The inverse supply curve slopes downward, indicating this negative correlation. 4.
