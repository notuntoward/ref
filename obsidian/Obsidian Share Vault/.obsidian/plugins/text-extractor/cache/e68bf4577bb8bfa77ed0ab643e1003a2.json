References\t87 APPENDIX\t88 THE FACTOR TYPE OF ORGANIZATION Introductory words This chapter gives an overview of the distribution of types of organizations (in the following: TYPES) across the projects, first. Secondly, the following questions will be answered: Does the average NOM of a project and the type of partners correlate with the type of project leader? Is there evidence in the data that certain TYPES “prefer” or “avoid” cooperation with another TYPE? Do certain TYPES ten to participate in collaborative or non-collaborative projects, in bigger or smaller projects (correlation type appearance vs. project size)? How did the appearance of TYPES develop over time? Distribution of TYPES in the R&D landscape In Figure 12 the distribution of the most common TYPES across all 1353 R&D projects (total number of members, non-unique) is shown. On the left you see the main TYPES, namely industrial institutions (IND), universities (UNI), public research organizations (PRO) and others (OTHER). On the right hand side, PRO are split up into three main sub-groups of interest such as Fraunhofer institutes (FHG), Helmholtz institutes (HLMH) and all other PRO. Figure 12 Distribution of the type of organization across all R&D projects. The non-unique number of members per type per project is taken into account IND is best represented in the R&D projects (1651 industrial members, 53% of 3098 total members). UNI make the second biggest group (863 units, 28% of 3098 total members) followed by PRO (347 members, 11%) and OTHER (237, 8%). Correlation between type of leader and cooperation The major question is whether there is a correlation between the type of leader and cooperation. We will first calculate the odds of the different organizations to be a leader of a collaborative project (how probable is collaborative leadership by each of them?) and then, how cooperation is affected by the kind of leader (how probable is cooperation under a certain type of leader?). Corresponding numbers are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Type vs. leadership in collaborative projects IND UNI PRO OTHER Total Leader of a collaborative project 313 253 88 21 675 (= all collaborative projects) Not a leader of a collaborative project 1338 610 259 216 2423 Total (TYPE) 1651 863 347 237 3098 (= all non-unique members) Odds (Leader/ nr. of collaborative projects 46% 38% 13% 3% 100% Odds (Leader /Total (TYPE)) 19% 29% 25% 9% - Odds ratio (3098 members) 0,24 0,68 0,58 0,16 - Cooperation projects with this leader 313 253 88 21 675 (= all collaborative projects) Cooperation projects NOT with this leader 362 422 587 654 Single-member-projects with this leader 319 214 61 84 678 (=all non-collaborative projects) Single-member-projects NOT with this leader 359 464 617 594 Odds ratio (1353 projects) 0,97 1,29 1,52 0,23 - Not all the different numbers needed for calculation of the different odds ratios are presented in this table. While with 46% the majority of the collaborative projects were led by IND, the so-called “relative risk” – in this case we could call it willingness – of IND to lead a collaborative project is lower (19%) compared to UNI (29%) and PRO (25%). The odds ratios in the last row of the first part of the table are calculated referring the full population of 3098 members in the R&D landscape. Comparing the odds ratios, the likeliness of a UNI to become a collaborative leader is the highest, followed by PRO. The probability of IND to become a collaborative leader is much lower. Let’s now investigate how the type of the leader affects the likeliness of a cooperation project to happen (second part of the table). Again, we calculate the odds ratios. However, this time we base the calculation on the population of 1353 projects. Since the odds ratio for an industrial leader is almost 1, this type of leader has almost no effect on the probability of cooperation (the effect is rather negative). Academic leaders increase the likeliness of cooperation by 1,3 times (or by 30%), and PRO even by 52%. OTHER leaders correlate negatively with cooperation. When they lead a project, the probability of cooperation is reduced to approx. 25%. Organization of collaborative projects vs. project leader type The next question is how these leaders organize cooperation: Which and how many partners do they select? Table 4 shows the number of collaborative projects and absolute NOM (of each TYPE) for each project leader TYPE under consideration differentiating between how many partners respectively how many members of each TYPE they had. The member counts reflect all members. The partner counts take into account only the additional partners. This differentiation had to be done in order to compare the results to other analyses. Caution is necessary when interpreting the membership scenario: by reducing the number of projects according to the type of leader under consideration, the numbers are biased because the leader reflects a part of the members already. For example, in 416 collaborative projects at least one member was a University. Projects with at least one University had a total of 647 academic members (excluding the 416 members already counted, 231 additional partners would be left). The average NOM of the projects under consideration is given below. Furthermore, the last row is to be understood as: there were 47 collaborative projects with only academic members. Table 4 Members in projects vs. TYPE (1353 projects) Leader TYPE Industry University PRO OTHER Nr. of led collab. projects** 313 253 88 21 Membership scenario Industry 872* 298 136 26 Universities 152 441* 48 6 PRO 80 78 121* 7 OTHER 58 51 12 32* Average NOM 3,7 3,4 3,6 3,4 Partnership scenario Industry 559 298 136 26 Universities 152 188 48 6 PRO 80 78 33 7 OTHER 58 51 12 11 Average nr. of partners 2,7 2,4 2,6 2,4 Projects with the same type only 116 47 7 4 * Includes the leaders**Number of collaborative projects ley by the respective TYPE (total: 675). The respective average of min. 3,4 and max. 3,7 members (leadership scenario) indicate that the type of leader does affect the NOM (which for all projects is 3,6, see chapter 3). The proportions of the above mentioned absolute numbers are shown in Figure 13. Bars are established for every type of leader under consideration. Colors indicate the type of the partner in their projects. Numbers are proportions. For example, 66% of the partners of industrial leaders have a private background. With 18% of their members being UNI, they tend to collaborate more often with UNI than with PRO and OTHER, and do rarely select the last two mentioned as partners (9% resp. 7%). Figure 13 Correlation between leadership and type of project partner (proportional) Consider looking at the graph having in mind the proportions of the TYPES regarding the full R&D landscape which were 53% for industry, 28% for Universities, 11% for PRO and 8% for OTHER, shown in Figure 12. (However, note that these proportions include the leaders so numbers are not perfectly comparable!). The industry clearly “prefers” to collaborate with other industrial organizations, and so do PRO. OTHER as well as UNI, particularly, collaborate less with IND than average. With at least every second member being IND, IND is the most common partner of all TYPES. However, we find a slight tendency of UNI to work less often with IND and more often with their own kind. There is also a big difference regarding the participation of OTHER: They appear much more often in project led by their own kind than in projects led y other TYPES. For all TYPES but PRO we can detect a higher degree of collaboration with their own kind when they are leaders. With only 14% of their partners being of their own kind, PRO is also the most “inter-organizational” collaborator. This could also imply a higher degree of competition between PROs. In summary, the results indicate that the type of leader does not only affect cooperation in terms of NOM but also the type of partner, and therefore the type of members in a project. Appearance of TYPES in different project size categories We will further check whether there are any patterns regarding the appearance of TYPES in the different project size categories (1-11 members). The size of a project, here, is defined as the absolute number of non-unique members in that project. Figure 14 sheds light on the participation of TYPES in projects (absolute numbers). Figure 14 Type of organization vs. project size (NOM) IND is the best represented TYPE in all project size categories, having its peak in projects with five members. UNI follows, being the second best represented type in almost all categories, but preferring single-member-projects. PRO are mostly spread across projects with one to five members, peaking in projects with five members just like IND. We can almost not see them in projects with more than five members. OTHER can be found in different project sizes, but they clearly show up most often in single-member projects. Figure 16 shows the proportions of IND, UNI, PRO and OTHER in each of the collaborative project sizes (with support lines) and draws linear trend lines. Figure 16 We can see that the proportion of IND (particularly) and OTHER (a little only) in projects increases with project size while the one of UNI (particularly) and PRO decreases. Furthermore we calculated the proportion of a TYPE’s presence in the 11 project size categories with regard to the total number of organizations of that TYPE in the R&D landscape. The highest share of OTHER can be found in single-member projects (of a total of 237 OTHER, 84 appeared in non-collaborative projects - 35,4%). With a 24,6% proportion of their own group, UNI are second biggest non-collaborators. Their participation drops almost constantly as the number of members in a project increases. PRO are cooperating the most: Only 17,6% of PRO do not cooperate which means that 82,4% of them do. With 80,7%, IND collaborate almost as much as PRO. Concluding, we find that OTHER are the “biggest non-collaborators”, followed with distance by UNI, IND, PRO. Development over time Lastly, we will analyze the development over time. The appearance of types of organizations in projects (absolute numbers) as well as the number of projects over the years is shown in Figure 18 (with support lines). Remember that for a few projects the start date was not available, therefore these projects are not represented in this graph but are comprised by the tables and calculations above. Also, the year 2013 is not shown in the graph as explained before. Figure 18 Presence of organization types in projects over time There is a general increase of members which is in line with the development of the number of projects (red dots; shown before also in Figure 3). The parallel becomes especially clear when looking at 1996, a year with an extreme increase of IND members and a sudden increase of projects starts. This graph makes it also possible to see that the number of members per project increased over time: While until ca. 1996 the red dots are above the dots for the number of members, those lines will partly be located above the red line, afterwards. The total number of IND participating in a project in every year increased stronger than that of the other TYPES. OTHER remained relatively stable. Interesting to see is that the number of PRO increased much slower than that of UNI during ca. 2000-2009. However, in 2012 their numbers of active members match. In line with this development is the development of the member proportion of the project consortia over time, which is presented in Figure 19. In this figure we can see that until 1991, the proportions of the TYPES in projects are very irregular. From 1992 until 1998 the industrial proportion increases steadily, displacing OTHER and UNI. The proportion of PRO in projects, after PRO having vanished in 1992 and 1993, “recovers” from 1994 on, growing quite regularly until today. Comparatively, we can observe a general decline of UNI from 2000 on, after UNI were very present in projects in 1999. We get a similar impression when looking at OTHER. However, this observation will not be further pursued during this thesis. Figure 19 Summary of results Summarizing the findings of this chapter: Most commonly among the 1353 R&D projects appear IND, followed by UNI, PRO and OTHER. The likeliness of a University to become a collaborative leader is the highest, followed by PRO. The probability of IND to become a collaborative leader is much lower. Academic leaders increase the likeliness of cooperation by 30%, and PRO by 52%. An industrial leader has a slightly negative effect on the probability of cooperation. When OTHER lead a project, the probability of cooperation is reduced to approx. 25%. There is evidence in the data that the type of leader does affect cooperation in terms of number of members as well as the type of the partner. The proportion of IND and OTHER per project increases with project size while the one of UNI and PRO decreases with project size. The biggest collaborators are PRO, followed by IND. The biggest non-collaborators are OTHER, followed by UNI. There is a general increase of active members in the R&D landscape which is in line with the development of the growing number of wind energy projects. During the past decade we can observe a decline of UNI, a repeated increase of IND, a growing participation of PRO and a decreasing amount of OTHER in the projects.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
