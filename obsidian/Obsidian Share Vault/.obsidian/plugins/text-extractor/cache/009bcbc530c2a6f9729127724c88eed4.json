Substantially less than \u0000\u0000 percent\u0000 Often down around \u0000\u0000 percent of the time\u0000” When his undergraduate apprentice\u0000 recent grad Aditya Kotak\u0000 noted that most political pollsters report \u0000\u0000 percent con\u0000dence levels\u0000 Moore decided to investigate whether they su\u0000er from the same overcon\u0000dence\u0000 By analyzing data from over \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 polls from \u0000\u0000 election cycles\u0000 Moore and Kotak found that only \u0000\u0000 percent of polls conducted the week before an election include the actual outcome\u0000 To many\u0000 \u0000\u0000 percent accuracy sounds bad\u0000 especially for something as important as presidential election results\u0000 But these \u0000ndings might not be as discouraging as they seem\u0000 “It’s really important to remember that these polls are not forecasting who’s going to win\u0000 They are an estimate of likely vote share\u0000” meaning the percentage of total votes that one candidate receives\u0000 Moore explains\u0000 “So this is about whether the truth falls inside the con\u0000dence interval\u0000 not whether the poll calls the eventual winner\u0000” A standard election poll\u0000 with a \u0000\u0000 percent con\u0000dence interval and a sample size of \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 people\u0000 estimates the vote share that a candidate is likely to receive plus or minus three percentage points\u0000 If\u0000 for example\u0000 a poll predicts that Joe Biden will get \u0000\u0000 percent of the popular vote\u0000 but in reality he only gets \u0000\u0000 percent\u0000 then the outcome would fall outside the poll’s three percent margin of error\u0000 While the general public might consider the poll a success\u0000 given that it correctly predicted that the candidate would win the majority\u0000 Moore’s study would count it as a failure\u0000 Con\u0000dence intervals that most political pollsters report only account for statistical sources of error\u0000 like sampling issues\u0000 Other non\u0000statistical sources of error could explain the disparity between polls’ \u0000\u0000 percent con\u0000dence and their \u0000\u0000 percent accuracy\u0000 Gabriel Lenz\u0000 a Berkeley professor specializing in American politics and political behavior\u0000 says that one polling technique that could be the culprit is “It’s really important to remember that these polls are not forecasting who’s going to win\u0000” says Don Moore\u0000 “They are an estimate of likely vote share\u0000” “Being able to anticipate the outcome of an election is very useful\u0000 even if you can only do so imperfectly\u0000” says Moore\u0000 “Just like anticipating whether it’s going to rain tomorrow\u0000” 12/17/24, 12:25 AM Election Polls Are Only 60 Percent Accurate, Which Is 0 Percent Surprising. - Cal Alumni Association https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/online/election-polls-are-only-60-percent-accurate-which-0-percent/ 2/8 herding\u0000 a process in which pollsters adjust their \u0000ndings to more closely resemble those of other recent polls and avoid reporting outliers\u0000 According to Lenz\u0000 likely voter screenings\u0000a series of questions that pollsters ask in order to determine whether someone is likely to vote and therefore whether they ought to be included in an election survey\u0000may also introduce error\u0000 as some percentage of those determined to be unlikely to vote often end up voting anyway\u0000 How can pollsters do better? “Expand the con\u0000dence intervals they report\u0000” says Moore\u0000 “The truth is that pollsters who communicate their polls relying solely on statistical sources of error will underestimate the actual error in their polls and therefore provide misleading con\u0000dence intervals\u0000” According to his analysis\u0000 pollsters would have to double the margins of error that they report in the week leading up to election day to be \u0000\u0000 percent con\u0000dent\u0000 This means that published poll results would need to provide a candidate’s estimated vote share plus or minus six percentage points\u0000 rather than the usual three\u0000 in order to capture the actual election result \u0000\u0000 percent of the time\u0000 For now\u0000 we can’t count on election polls to be as accurate as their con\u0000dence levels suggest\u0000 So do they still have value? “Certainly\u0000” says Moore\u0000 “Just being able to anticipate the outcome of an election is very useful\u0000 even if you can only do so imperfectly\u0000 Just like anticipating whether it’s going to rain tomorrow\u0000 or where the hurricane is going to land is very useful information\u0000 even if your forecasts aren’t spot on\u0000” Lenz agrees\u0000 Even with their imperfections\u0000 polls still o\u0000er valuable insight\u0000 For instance\u0000 they can help give us a sense of whether election results are right\u0000 If an election outcome were to diverge massively from polling predictions\u0000 we would likely suspect voter fraud\u0000 Polls can also help politicians learn what voters expect from them\u0000 “In this case\u0000 the lesson might be that voters really want the president to do a good job managing a pandemic\u0000 Being able to look at polls and see that message is really important for democracy\u0000” says Lenz\u0000 “It’s important for politicians to learn from elections\u0000 One of the main ways that we can help them do that is to conduct polls\u0000\u0000and they don’t need to be perfectly accurate for that\u0000” With the \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 election just around the corner\u0000 instead of obsessing over polls\u0000 Lenz suggests that concerned voters \u0000nd more constructive ways to spend their time\u0000 “Political junkies get into polls\u0000 like it’s a sports game or something\u0000” he says\u0000 “They could probably use that time to try to convince other people to change their votes\u0000 or try to get other people to vote to increase overall turnout\u0000” Share this article Instead of obsessing over polls\u0000 Gabriel Lenz suggests that concerned voters \u0000nd more constructive ways to spend their time\u0000 12/17/24, 12:25 AM Election Polls Are Only 60 Percent Accurate, Which Is 0 Percent Surprising. - Cal Alumni Association https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/online/election-polls-are-only-60-percent-accurate-which-0-percent/ 3/8 About California MagazineJoin Our NewsletterClass NotesThe Edge Podcast Follow Us Related Articles Methodology in Their Madness\u0000 To Err Is Human\u0000 to Poll Requires an Algorithm Last week Hillary Clinton was tied with Donald Trump for broad discontent among voters in a New York Times tracking poll\u0000 This week in the race for the presidency\u0000 Hillary beats Trump by \u0000ve points according to a CNN poll\u0000 And a couple of weeks ago\u0000 a Rasmussen poll had Trump ahead by a couple of ticks\u0000 \u0000…\u0000 12/17/24, 12:25 AM Election Polls Are Only 60 Percent Accurate, Which Is 0 Percent Surprising. - Cal Alumni Association https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/online/election-polls-are-only-60-percent-accurate-which-0-percent/ 4/8 Revenge of the Libertarians\u0000 How This Third Party Could Sway the \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Election With Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump unprecedentedly unpopular\u0000\u0000\u0000 percent of voters view her unfavorably\u0000 and \u0000\u0000 percent hold a negative opinion of him\u0000third parties see a chance to make a real dent in this presidential election\u0000 And the third party in the best position to do so?
