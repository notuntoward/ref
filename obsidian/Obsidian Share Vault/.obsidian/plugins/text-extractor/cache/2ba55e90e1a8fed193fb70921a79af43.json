Braun 1 · Christoph Brunner2 © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature 2018 Abstract The introduction of the quarter-hourly intraday auction in 2014 for the German market conﬁrms a tendency towards short-term energy markets. The reason for the new market was the need to trade shorter periods than just hours a day-ahead to minimize open positions in the more volatile continuous intraday trading. The increased production capacity of solar power boosted this requirement for new short-term power products. The quarter-hourly market shows a distinctive zigzag price formation. We identify two inﬂuencing factors: ﬁrst, the solar residual that combines the trading of solar power ramps around midday as well as the gradients of consumption and thermal power plant ramps throughout the course of the day, and second, a characteristic two stage market design with higher liquidity for the hourly than for the quarter-hourly auction. Therefore, demand, solar generation and inﬂexible ramps of thermal power plants are hedged at the hourly day-ahead auction and use the quarter-hourly auction only to balance the remaining differences. To prove this argument the price sensitivities of the hourly day-ahead and quarter-hourly intraday auctions in Germany are compared based on actual bid and ask curves from 2015 and 2016. Finally, the development of an adequate design of future spot markets is discussed. Keywords Day-ahead auction · Intraday auction · Price sensitivity · Variable renewable energy sources Preissensitivität an der stündlichen Day-ahead und viertelstündlicher Intraday Auktion in Deutschland Zusammenfassung Die Einführung der viertelstündlichen Intraday-Auktion im Jahre 2014 für den deutschen Strommarkt untermauert die Be- deutung der kurzfristigen Energiemärkte. Der Grund für die Einführung war der Bedarf, bereits vortägig, viertelstündliche Mengen auszugleichen und offene Positionen im volatilen kontinuierlichen Intraday-Handel zu minimieren. Die gestiegene Stromproduktion aus Solarenergie verstärkte die Nachfrage nach neuen kurzfristigen Produkten. Der Viertelstundenmarkt zeigt eine ausgeprägte Zickzack-Preisbildung. Wir identiﬁzieren zwei Einﬂussfaktoren: erstens, den Handel von Solarram- pen um die Mittagszeit, sowie die Gradienten von Nachfrage und thermischer Erzeugung im Laufe des Tages und zweitens, ein charakteristisches zweistuﬁges Marktdesign mit höherer Liquidität an den stündlichen als auf der viertelstündlichen Auktion. Die unterschiedliche Liquidität lässt darauf schließen, dass bei der stündlichen Day-Ahead-Auktion die solare Erzeugung und die unﬂexiblen Rampen thermischer Kraftwerke abgesichert und die viertelstündliche Auktion genutzt, um die verbleibenden Differenzen auszugleichen. Um diese Aussage argumentativ zu veriﬁzieren, werden die Preissensi- tivitäten der stündlichen Day-Ahead- und viertelstündlichen Intraday-Auktionen in Deutschland anhand der tatsächlichen Angebots- und Nachfragekurven von 2015 und 2016 verglichen. Abschließend wird die Entwicklung einer adäquaten Gestaltung zukünftiger Spotmärkte diskutiert. \u0002 Sebastian M.

The continuously increasing trading demand also led to the introduction of new spot products (EPEX Spot 2015a, p. 20). One example therefore is the launch of the quarter-hourly intraday auction for the German market area in December 2014. According to the power exchange EPEX Spot, this was a reaction to an increased day-ahead demand for shorter order types to reduce the magnitude of unbalanced quarter-hourly schedules already day-ahead (EPEX Spot 2015b, p. 2). This paper expounds the inﬂuence of variable renew- able energy sources (RES) on the newly introduced Ger- man intraday auction. This includes especially the trading strategy for unbalanced quarter-hourly day-ahead sched- ules of the RES solar and wind, load changes as well as ramps of inﬂexible thermal power plants. A distinct zigzag price pattern can be observed on the quarter-hourly mar- ket that might be caused by the interaction with the hourly day-ahead auction due to volume and liquidity differences. A higher price sensitivity on the quarter-hourly market than on the hourly market can be expected. For market partici- pants, a deep understanding of the new market is crucial to grasp the interdependencies with other short-term markets and especially, to know how sensitive market prices are if additional quantity of energy are bid into the market. Chapter II introduces a placement of the quarter-hourly intraday auction into the existing European short-term power market landscape as well as an overview on di- mension for market liquidity. Within the current design of short-term electricity markets the key characteristics of the new quarter-hourly intraday auction are explained in chap- ter II. This includes the dissimilar trading volumes of the hourly day-ahead and quarter-hourly intraday markets as well as the price zigzag effect of the latter are analyzed and explained including the impact of RES trading. To sketch the specialties of and differences between short-term power markets a method is derived to analyze the price sensi- tivity of day-ahead markets. Section IV presents method and ﬁndings of both hourly day-ahead and quarter-hourly intraday auction price sensitivity calculations in Germany for the years 2015 and 2016. Chapter V concludes with the major ﬁndings of this paper and provides a critical discussion about the current market design. 2 Spot Markets and Market Efficiency A strong variety of European short-term electricity mar- kets has been established. A brief overview of selected spot markets is presented in part A as well as how the new Ger- man quarter-hourly day-ahead market differs from the ex- isting short-term markets throughout Europe. In part B, the various dimensions of market efﬁeciency including price sensitvity are addressed, which are crucial for the more de- tailled analysis in part III. 2.1 Spot Markets in Europe Nearly all European countries have implemented spot mar- kets consisting of day-ahead and intraday markets by now. Beside other, politics aim to improve the existing market designs permanently to enable even higher shares of gener- ation from weather driven RES as cost efﬁcient as possible and without risking security of supply. To illustrate the key differences throughout Europe, the shares of variable RES and the existing short-term trading possibilities for some exemplary markets are listed in Table 1. This comparison indicates that the predominant intraday market design and pricing rule is continuous pay as bid. Furthermore, this mar- ket review also hints that countries tend to adapt their mar- ket structure, in addition to other effects, according to their production mix. The shortest gate closure time or last trad- ing possibility before delivery varies strongly from 180 min in Poland (TGE 2016) with a major share of hard coal ﬁred power plants and 5 min in the Netherlands (EPEX Spot 2016a) with higher cross-border exchanges and an increas- ing importance of wind power. Spain, as well as Portugal and Italy, perform multiple marginal uniform pricing auc- tions that take place at regular times during the intraday to pool liquidity (OMIE 2016;GME 2016). In contrast to the different intraday market designs, all European day-ahead markets are based on marginal uni- form pricing auctions with trading products for each hour and blocks of several hours. Germany and France allow half-hours and Austria and Germany allow quarter-hours to be traded. Germany is the only country in Europe that performs two auctions on the day before delivery, of which the second is the newly introduced quarter-hourly intraday auction. Similar to the hourly day-ahead auction at 12 pm, the quarter-hourly intraday auction is based on marginal uniform pricing, also called clearing price auction (EPEX Spot 2015c). For a technical analysis of this auction type the interested reader is referred to Krishna (2002). However, the main advantages of the quarter-hourly in- traday auction in comparison to the continuous intraday are the trading during regular ofﬁce hours and the bundling of liquidity (Hagemann and Weber 2013). Therewith, the new intraday auction is especially beneﬁcial for smaller mar- ket participants since it gives them the possibility to trade all 96 quarters of the next day without providing around the clock shifts for continuous trading. Furthermore, the concentration of market volume at a certain point in time enables higher market liquidity compared to continuous in- K ZEnergiewirtsch Table 1 Overview of European Intraday and day-ahead Markets, data derived from the energy exchange operators EXAA (2016), EPEX Spot (2015c, 2016a), Nord Pool (2016), OMIE (2016), TGE 2016, Eurostat (2016) Selected countries Solar energy sources a (%) Wind energy sources a (%) Intraday market Day-ahead market Main market place Last trade possibility Pricing rule Type of order Pricing rule Type of order Austria 1 6 30 min Continuous pay as bid Quarters, hours, blocks Marginal uniform pricing auction Hours, blocks, quarters EPEX Spot, EXAA Germany 7 11 30 min, 5 min within 4 TSO areas Quarters, halves hours, blocks Hours, blocks 3pm day-a- head Marginal uni- form pricing auction Quarters France 1 4 30 min Continuous pay as bid Halves hours, blocks Netherlands 1 6 5 min Hours, blocks EPEX Spot Denmark 2 43 60 min Nord Pool ELSPOT Poland 0 6 90–180 min OPCOM Spain 6 22 195–250 min Marginal uni- form pricing auction OMIE aShare of solar or wind power of total electricty production per country in the year 2014 traday trading. Sufﬁcient liquidity is a key for economic welfare and a goal of many market reforms (Amihud 2002) increases the overall market efﬁciency. 2.2 Dimensions of Market Liquidity Market liquidity is a performance indicator for the efﬁ- ciency of a market. Therefore, Liquidity itself can be de- ﬁned from a trader’s perspective as the ability to buy or sell at any size and time without inﬂuencing the price with one’s orders (Amihud and Mendelson 1986; Arnott and Wagner 1990;Liu 2006; Amihud 2002). Literature distinguishes between six dimensions to measure liquidity in a market: ● Bid-ask spread: Paukste and Raudys (2013), Hagemann and Weber (2013), Amihud and Mendelson (1986)and with focus on trading costs Liu (2006), spreads Kempf et al. (2009) and tightness Kyle (1985) ● Resiliency: Kyle (1985), Foucault et al. (2005)that has been used by Hagemann and Weber (2013) ● Market depth: Kyle (1985) and with focus on price im- pact Liu (2006), Amihud (2002) and Weber (2010) ● Trading activity: Hagemann and Weber (2013) ● Delay and search costs: Amihud and Mendelson (1986) and Liu (2006) ● Short-run volatility: Handa and Schwartz (1996), Ahn et al. (2001) and Engle et al. (2011) However, for diverse market designs and availability of information different dimensions can be appropriate to mea- sure market liquidity. For example, the EU (2007) states the trading volume as an important ﬁnancial meter for trading activity and liquidity in the energy markets while others stress the market depth, i. e. the ability of market partici- pants to ﬁnd counterparts, as a signiﬁcant factor to address market liquidity. A further attempt is the calculation of price sensitivity as a combination of bid-ask spread, market depth and trading activity. This combined price sensitivity calculation can be seen for example in Goyenko et al. (2009)or Kempf (1999). The advantage of this price sensitivity calculation is that all three approaches can be measured using the characteristics of the demand and supply function. The domain restrictions of demand and supply determine the market depth, the in- tersection gives some indication for the trading activity and the gradient of both functions at their intersection provides the bid-ask spread. Therefore, price sensitivity seems most adequate to analyze the liquidity of auction-based energy markets combining the three dimensions named above. 3 German Quarter-hourly Intraday Auction Analysation As a consequence of the need for shorter order types espe- cially because of the increasing solar power production, pol- K ZEnergiewirtsch itics, German federal network agency (BNetzA) and EPEX Spot haved worked on improving the market conditions and therefore introduced the quarter-hourly intraday auction in December 2014. In addition to the already existing hourly day-ahead auction and the quarter-hourly and hourly intra- day continuous markets, this new market is the fourth short- term energy-only EPEX Spot market for the German mar- ket area. The bidding for this new auction takes place at 3pm on the day before delivery, three hours after the hourly day-ahead auction. The EPEX Spot named the new mar- ket 15-min. Intraday Auction as it marks the opening of the continous intraday trading for the following day that starts afterwards. The chapter is subdivided into three parts to speciﬁcally analyze this new auction in terms of trading volume, RES impact and price structure. This helps to understand the special nature of this market and sets the foundation for the comparison of this new market with the existing hourly day-ahead market in the next chapter. 3.1 Trading Volume The spot markets play an important role in the liberalized energy system as they enable the balancing of supply and demand based on price signals. However, the displayed trading volumes in Fig. 1a illustrate that there are sub- stantial differences between the hourly and quarter-hourly products in the day-ahead and intraday auctions and the continuous intraday trading in Germany. The hourly day- ahead auction is the predominant short-term energy market that accounts for more than 85% of the short-term traded energy. Each quarter-hourly market in Germany accounts for less than 5% of the overall short-term market trading. Thus, a more limited liquidity than for the hourly markets can already be expected for the quarter-hourly markets just because of their lower trading volume. With the introduction of the quarter-hourly intraday auc- tion in December 2014 the overall trading volume increased considerably, whereas the trading volume of the continuous quarter-hourly intraday market decreased in the ﬁrst fol- lowing months, see Fig. 1b. The trend of increasing quar- terly trading volume stopped in mid-2015. The trading vol- ume for both quarter-hourly markets during the second half year of 2015 stagnated at about 0.3 to 0.4 TWh per month. This can be converted to an average trading turnover of circa 500 MW for each quarter-hourly product which seems sparse in comparison to approximately 28,000 MW for the hourly day-ahead market. 3.2 Impact of Renewable Energy Sources One of the reasons for the introduction of the quarter-hourly intraday auction in Germany is the better integration of RES (EPEX Spot 2015b, p. 2). Therefore, in the following the correlation between different types of varying RES and the new quarter-hourly intraday auction are analyzed. Fig. 2a depicts the 1800 quarter-hours of the year 2015 with the highest gradient in solar power production in comparison to the trading volume for the respective quarter hour. The solar power production corresponds to the sum of all units that are sold on the market by the TSO under the RES act regime. For this solar power production, a strong Pearson product-moment correlation with a coefﬁcient of p =0.82 can be determined. All other quarters are less interesting since the quarter-hourly load gradients and therewith the difference between hourly and quarter-hourly RES trading is negligible. For PV, the latter is especially the case during night hours. The strong correlation hints that gradients of solar power production are signiﬁcant for the quarter-hourly intraday auction. This is comprehensible as the solar power production forecast for the next day is already very accurate and follows minute-precise the course of the sun (ENTSO- E 2016). In addition, Fig. 2b illustrates also the 1800 quarter-hours with the highest change in wind power production for one quarter of an hour and the corresponding trading volume of this quarter hour. The calculation is also based on the pro- duction data of wind units supported by the RES act which accounted for the predominate share of wind parks in Ger- many. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefﬁcient for these 1800 quarter-hours of the year 2015 amounts to p = 0.35. Hence, compared to PV, the amount of wind power traded and therefore its inﬂuence on the quarterly intra- day auction seems rather limited. This conclusion appears reasonable since already the day-ahead wind forecasts in quarter-hourly resolution are quite unprecise and likely to change until delivery again (ENTSO-E 2016). 3.3 Price Structure In this subchapter, the characteristic price structure of the quarter-hourly intraday auction in comparison to the hourly day-ahead auction is explained. The price level over the course of the day generally depends on the underlying merit order and the residual load, i. e. the demand subtracted by the variable solar and wind generation. This can be seen in Fig. 3 comparing the daily pattern of the average historic hourly prices of 2015 (dotted black line) with the average vertical grid load of 2015 in quarter-hourly time resolu- tion (solid black line). The vertical grid load speciﬁes the load fed-in from the higher transmission grid level into the subordinate distribution grid which adumbrates the residual load comparatively well, as most RES units feed into the grid at medium and low voltage level while conventional thermal power stations that produce the remaining residual load are usually connected to the grid at high voltage level.

Data derived from EPEX Spot (2015c) In addition, the average quarter-hourly prices of 2015 in Fig. 3 (solid grey line) show a strong zigzag effect around the hourly prices. To be more speciﬁc, the amplitude of the zigzag follows the gradient of the residual load. The ﬁrmer the increase or decrease of the residual load the higher is the demand for quarter-hourly trading. The slope of the residual load is a result of the usual demand ramps in the morning and the late evening as well as the solar ramps around mid- day, as seen in Fig. 4. These are exactly the quarter-hours with the most distintive zigzag price pattern on an annual average. Despite these intense ﬂuctuations of the quarter- hourly market the average price levels of all short-term en- ergy markets are nearly identical (EPEX Spot 2015c) and can be assumed to be arbitrage free (EPEX Spot 2015a). The origination of the zigzag effect is exemplarily ex- plained for solar power in the following but applies sim- ilarly for the zigzags induced by demand gradients and ramps of thermal power plants. The strong inﬂuence of solar generation is visible in the change of the quarter- hourly trading volume over the course of the year, see again Fig. 1b. The general method of trading solar power in the hourly and the quarter-hourly intraday auctions is illustrated K ZEnergiewirtsch Fig. 2 Correlation coefﬁcient p for changes in a solar power production and b wind power production within one quarter of an hour and the quarter-hourly day-intraday auction trading volume.

The solid black line depicts the average solar energy production in Germany. This curve can be approx- imated by the light grey hourly stepwise bars symbolizing the expected bidding on the hourly day-ahead auction at 12 pm. The difference between the minute-precise forecast and the hourly stepwise function is the remaining quantitiy (solid black bars) that is traded in the quarter-hourly intra- day auction at 3 pm day-ahead. During the morning hours when the sun rises, solar power producers have a short po- sition and therefore act as buyers in the ﬁrst quarter hour and vice versa in the last quarter hour. In the afternoon, this zigzag pattern is the other way around, they hold a long position in the ﬁrst quarter hour and short positions in the last quarter. Due to the signiﬁcant difference of trading vol- ume, see again Fig. 1a with an average trading turnover of 500 MW for each quarter-hourly product and the differ- ence in price sensitivity that will be analyzed in the two following chapters, it seems plausible to hedge 40,000 MW installed PV capacity (BMWI 2016) as well as inﬂexible ramps of thermal power plants and load at the hourly day- ahead auction and use the quarter-hourly auction only to balance the remaining differences. 4 Calculating Price Sensetivity As described in chapter II part B, price sensitivity is an important information to compare the different nature of K ZEnergiewirtsch Fig. 4 Exemplary solar power trading on hourly day-ahead and quarter-hourly intraday auctions in Germany.

Due to the stepwise character, the intersection is not explicit in a and c hourly day-ahead and quarter-hourly intraday auctions in Germany. The introduced approach and the results are solely based on public information, i. e. historical RES gen- eration in Germany given by the TSO as well as bid and ask curves for the same time period available at the power exchange EPEX Spot homepage (EPEX Spot 2015c). In the ﬁrst part of this chapter a general approach is introduced to calculate the market clearing price in differ- ent demand and supply situations which is the foundation for the price sensitivity analysis of auction based markets. Furthermore, it is explained how the price sensitivity com- putation is done by moving the bid or ask curves, locate the new intersection and derive the expected price change. In the second part an example is sketched determining the price sensitivity of a pumped hydropower storage operator bidding for a speciﬁc product in the German quarter-hourly intraday market. Finally, part three presents the results of the price sensitivity calculation for the years 2015 and 2016. 4.1 Market Clearing Price Every auction participant hands in one or a set of orders each including the following information: delivery period, product, order direction (buy/sell), quantity q and pricec. The energy exchange sorts all buy offers in descending or- der to receive the ask side merit order a.q/ and all sell offers in ascending order to obtain the bid side merit or- der b.q/. The intersection of both stepwise demand and supply functions deﬁnes the market clearing price c\u0002 MC and quantity q\u0002 MC . For strictly monotonous increasing functions this point is explicitly deﬁned. For the more gen- eral monotonous increasing stepwise functions three differ- ent intersections can be observed, see Fig. 5. In a and c it is illustrated that at the intersection, either c\u0002 MC or q\u0002 MC is not explicitly deﬁned. In these cases, c\u0002 MC or q\u0002 MC is calculated as described in the price coupling of regions (PCR) initiative by the European power exchanges so that in case a the intermediate between c\u0002 MC +and c\u0002 MC − de- termines c\u0002 MC and in case c the trading volume is max- imized so that q\u0002 MC + = q\u0002 MC (EPEX Spot 2016b). K ZEnergiewirtsch ∗ , , ∗ ∗ , , ∗ ab Fig. 6 Graphical proof for shifting demand and supply in opposite directions by the same quantity leads to the same market clearing price for a strict monotonous increasing (decreasing) functions and for b monotonous increasing (decreasing) functions The price sensitivity l determines the change of the mar- ket clearing price c\u0002 MC if an additional quantity \u0002 is added to the market. It can be distinguished between ad- ditional quantity on the bid side b.q + \u0002/ and additional quantity on the ask side a.q + \u0002/. To determine the price sensitivity, ﬁrst the bid or ask side merit order is shifted, second the new market clearing price calculated and third, the price sensitivity computed as the difference of the new market clearing price minus the original market clearing price. The price effect is always equal for a seller reducing (in- creasing) offers or a buyer lowering (increasing) demand since the two curves intersect at the same price sections just mirrored. Deﬁning that f be a strictly monotonically in- creasing function and g be a strictly monotonically decreas- ing function. It follows that .f; g/; .f \u0002; g/; .f; g\u0002/ have ex- actly one intersection given that f \u0002.x/ = f.x−a/^g\u0002.x/ = g.x + a/ 8x.Be .t; u/ the intersection of f \u0002 and g and .v; r/ the intersection of g\u0002 and f then it need to be demon- strated that f \u0002.t/ = g\u0002.v/, u = f \u0002.t/ = g.t/ = g\u0002.t − a/ and u = f \u0002.t/ = f.t − a/ are true. It can be followed that g\u0002.t − a/ = f.t − a/ = u and g\u0002 and f have an intersection at .t −a; u/.Since g\u0002 and f have just one intersection which is .v; r/, t − a = v holds true and from g\u0002.t − a/ = g\u0002.v/ it can be followed that f \u0002.t/ = g\u0002.v/. This is illustrated in Fig. 6a for strict monotonous increasing (decreasing) functions. This holds true as well for the intersection of a monotonously increasing (bid) and a monotonously de- creasing (ask) function which can be proofed graphically as presented in Fig. 6b. However, the trading volume changes according to the particular slope of bid and ask curves in both cases. 4.2 Exemplary Shift of Bid and Ask Curves Fig. 7a depicts an EPEX Spot quarter-hourly intraday auc- tion example from October 10th, 2015 for the delivery pe- riod from 7:15pm to 7:30pm (EPEX Spot 2015c). All offers of designated sellers are cumulated in the bid and all offers of identiﬁed buyers are collected in the ask curve. The in- tersection of the two curves sets the market clearing price. For the exemplary time period that was 69.81 C/MWh with a trading volume of 350 MW. Based on this starting point, the price sensitivity can be calculated for new market participants e. g. a pumped hy- dropower storage operator. In a ﬁrst step, the bid curve has been shifted by 200 MW to identify the potential price in- crease due to a market participant willing to buy 200 MW in this auction. In a second step, the ask curve has been shifted by 200 MW as well to derive the possible price decrease a market participant willing to sell additionally quantities of energy in this auction might has to accept. The exam- ple for a shift of +200 MW on the buy side is plotted in Fig. 7b, showing that the potential market clearing price would shift up to 73.06 C/MWh with an increase of market volume to 392 MW. Vice versa, the expected market clear- ing price would drop to 68.37 C/MWh while the trading volume expands even further to 503 MW, if the sell curve is shifted by +200 MW, see Fig. 7c. The resulting spread between the original and the shifted market clearing price can be interpreted as price sensi- tivity. In this example, the price sensitivity amounts to 3.25 C/MWh per 200 MW for demand and –1.44 C/MWh per 200 MW for supply. That means a buyer willing to purchase 200 MW for that period should expect to pay 3.25 C/MWh additionally to the observed market clear- ing price in the quarter-hourly intraday auction. Vice versa, K ZEnergiewirtsch ab c Fig. 7 a Examplary bid (solid line) and ask curve (dash-dot line) of the quarter-hourly intraday auction for October 10 th 2015 7:15 pm to 7:30 pm showing the market clearing price and the trading volume b additional 200 MW on the ask side and c on the bid side leading to a new ask curve (dashed line), market clearing price and trading volume. Data derived from EPEX Spot (2015c) a seller willing to trade 200 MW more might has to accept a markdown of –1.44 C/MWh. As in the example the price sensitivity calculation can be determined for any time step, product and quantity bid into the market. Computing a detailed course of sensitiv- ity of a speciﬁc product is done by running through all incremental quantities bid into the market. This can be done for any uniform market designs based on bid and ask curves, whereas the speciﬁcs of the respective electric- ity market need to be considered. For example, the price on the German quarter-hourly intraday auction is limited to –500 and 3000 C/MWh with increments not smaller than 0.1 C/MWh. 4.3 Results for Hourly Day-ahead and Quarter- hourly Intraday Auctions As emphasized in chapter III the trading volume in the hourly day-ahead market is about 70 times higher than in the quarter-hourly intraday auction market, see Fig. 1a. Therefore, it can be expected that the quarter-hourly mar- ket has a higher price sensitivity than the hourly market. That this expectation holds true is shown in the following by comparing the results for the price sensitivity calcula- tions of the quarter-hourly and the hourly day-ahead auc- tion in Germany for the years 2015 and 2016. The year 2015 is the ﬁrst complete year after the introduction of the German quarter-hourly intraday auction in December 2014. The hourly and respectively the quarter-hourly results have been aggregated, clustered and depicted in box plots that present the median in the middle as well as the 25 and 75% quantiles at the bars’ ends. While the whiskers mark the 5 and 95% quantiles, the dots beyond the whiskers indicate outliers. The results for the two auctions are analyzed sepa- rately, ﬁrstly, the long-established hourly and secondly, the quarter-hourly auction. Fig. 8 displays the price sensitivity boxplots of the cou- pled German and Austrian hourly day-ahead EPEX Spot auction of all 8760 h of 2015 and 8784 h of 2016. The ca- pacity shifts of 50 to 6400 MW are set by doubling the additional bid and ask quantity in each step. Between 200 and 3200 MW additional ask quantity, and between 200 and 6400 MW additional bid quantity, the price sensitivity in- creases almost linearly by 0.25 C/MWh per 100 MW bid or ask shift. For shifts up to 1600 MW most of the cal- culated price deviations for the hourly day-ahead auction are within the box of the boxplot, i. e. they are within the 25 and 75% quantile which indicates a low standard de- viation. Generally, from 1600 MW on, a signiﬁcant num- ber of outliers are visible with noticeable price deltas over 100 C/MWh. Some of these outliers are likely to originate from exceptional circumstances such as the solar eclipse on March 20th 2015 (EPEX Spot 2015d). Considering the logarithmic scale of the abscises in Fig. 5, the median con- tinues to increase nearly linearly with additional volume of bid and ask shifts. Furthermore, it can be noticed that K ZEnergiewirtsch Fig. 8 Price sensitivity on the German hourly day-ahead auctions in 2015 and 2016.

This can be explained by a currently strong supply side of production capacity on the German electricity market. The price sensitivity boxplots of the German quarter- hourly EPEX Spot intraday auction are shown in Fig. 9, summarizing the sensitivity results for all 35,040 quarter- hours of 2015 and 35,136 quarter-hours of 2016 for capacity shifts of 50 to 1600 MW. Again, the additional bid and ask quantity in each step is doubled. The different limitations of the maximal volume shift for the quarter-hourly market is based on the observation that the cumulated bid and ask curves rarely exceed 2000 MW and that the average vol- ume of actual executed orders per quarter-hour is less than 500 MW. The results show that with up to 800 MW addi- tional bid and ask quantity the price increase of the median is again almost linear. However, with about 1.5 C/MWh per 100 MW it is six times higher than for the hourly day-ahead auction. And again, for higher changes of bid and ask quan- tities the price sensitivity increases also disproportionately. But in contrast to the hourly day-ahead auction, the results indicate that the disparity of the price sensitivity on ask and on bid side is less distinct. This rather similar pricing of ﬂexibility in both directions might be a hint that the quar- ter-hourly auction just levels out the deviations between the hourly products and the continuous course of the residual load, see chapter III A. A further explanation might be that the available technologies fulﬁlling the ﬂexibility require- ments for quarter-hourly products differ from the typical merit order of the hourly auction. However, the spread be- tween the lower and upper end of the boxplot opens much faster than for the hourly market, indicating not just a higher sensitivity but also a larger variance of prices. 5 Critical Discussion In this part, the quantitative price sensitivity calculation from the previous chapters is broadened by a qualitative discussion. In the ﬁrst part, motivation and key drivers for the quarter-hourly intraday auction are revised. Thereafter the implication of divergent price sensitivities on the hourly and quarter-hourly intraday auctions for market participants and the challenge of providing an efﬁcient market regime K ZEnergiewirtsch Fig. 9 Price sensitivity on the German quarter-hourly intraday auctions in 2015 and 2016.

Fi- nally, the results are discussed in the context of further developments of the short-term power market design. The impetus for the new quarter-hourly intraday market was the need to trade shorter time periods than just hours in order to minimize risky open positions in the quarter- hourly continuous intraday trading already day ahead. As pointed out in chapter III, one main driver that boosted this requirement for new short-term power products was the increased production capacity of solar power (see Ta- ble 1b and Fig. 2a). Since the day-ahead forecasts for so- lar is more precise in comparison to onshore and offshore wind, the quarter-hourly intraday auction is solar domi- nated. This can be substantiated by comparing forecast and actual generation data for Germany published for example by the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform (ENTSO-E 2016). Hence, as the day-ahead forecast of wind is less reliable it can be assumed that the trading of wind power forecast de- viations is rather limited to the intraday continuous market. However, to verify the latter argumentation further research is needed. In the quarter-hourly day ahead market a distinc- tive zigzag price formation is apparent. Three inﬂuencing factors can be enumerated: the trading of solar power ramps around midday as well as the gradients of consumption and thermal power plant ramps throughout the course of the day. Due to the characteristic two-stage market design with highest liquidity on the hourly and lower liquidity on the quarter-hourly auction, hedging solar generation, inﬂexible thermal power plants and demand at the hourly day-ahead auction and using the quarter-hourly auction only to bal- K ZEnergiewirtsch Fig. 10 Exemplary solar power trading on hourly day-ahead and quarter-hourly intraday auctions at different points of time on the left hand side and combined quarter-hourly and hourly clearing on the right hand side.

Generally, both markets are nearly arbitrage free comparing the EPEX Spot day-ahead auction results, i. e. over a certain period of time the average price of the respective four quarter-hours equals the hourly price. Regardless of ﬂexibility support and zigzag price curve explanation, from a fundamental perspective, it seems ques- tionable that the last quarter of the previous and the ﬁrst quarter of the next hour deviate disproportionately com- pared to changes of residual load as it is for instance the case in the morning and in the afternoon or evening (see Fig. 3). Ceteris paribus, if there are just changes of so- lar production and variations of the overall demand that is covered by thermal production, the prices should con- tinuously follow the height and the gradient of the solar residual, i. e. overall electricity demand subtracted by so- lar generation. It can be assumed that in parts of the solar residual slope a speciﬁc ﬂexibility merit order exists that displaces less ﬂexible power plants. But from a fundamen- tal perspective this should only smoothen the price course between the last and the ﬁrst quarter of two different hours if both markets would be cleared together. On the left-hand side of Fig. 6 the solar power trading regime with the ac- tual hourly and quarter-hourly market prices is presented and on the right a possible resulting single quarter-hourly price curve is sketched as a dotted black line if both markets would be cleared together. It could be that a joint hourly and quarter-hourly day-ahead auction would ensure a more efﬁcient market clearing due to the bundling of market liq- uidity. However, the example of the Energy Exchange Aus- tria (EXAA), which clears both quarter-hourly and hourly day-ahead auction together since 2014, is still characterized by a zigzag course (EXAA, 2014,p. 4; 2016). If that is due to the case that market participants with need for quarter- hourly day-ahead products stick to their hedge-oriented bid- ding strategies on the more liquid subsequent EPEX auction for the same market areas where both day-ahead auctions with their signiﬁcantly different trading volumes are sep- arated by time or if there are other reasons that prevent a smoother quarter-hourly price structure should be subject to further research. It need to be mentioned that a Euro- pean-wide introduction of 15 min products to the coupled day-ahead markets would entail signiﬁcant technical and regulatory constraints. The present two-stage market design with its respective price sensitivities has consequences for most market par- ticipants. A solar producer, for instance, that would bid his whole generation only in the more price sensitive quarter- hourly intraday market is likely to cause higher self-induced price changes than in the less price sensitive hourly day- ahead market. With a shift towards auction-based support tariffs (BMWI 2015, pp. 81), more solar power plants will be traded by the owners or a third-party under the so-called direct marketing regime. Hence, without the guarantee of ﬁxed feed-in tariffs, price sensitivity and price differences of the various short-term markets already need to be in- cluded during the investment decision of new solar power plants. The same accounts for operators with ﬂexible capac- ity. To maximize revenues, they have to take into account the price sensitivities at the short-term markets. The busi- ness case of e. g. storage units is to deliver energy in high price periods and store energy during times with low prices. The growth in solar power generation is likely to increase these temporal price spreads especially in the quarter-hourly intraday market. The idea of the further development of the German electricity market is that such price signals will incentivize investment in additional ﬂexibility, especially if scarcity prices are permitted (BMWI 2015, pp. 48). How- ever, in the long-term these higher spreads might also lead to cyclical ﬂuctuations of available capacities for storage and other ﬂexibilities similar to the economic effect known as the pork cycle. This means, that on the one hand, an K ZEnergiewirtsch increased price volatility induced by more solar power will enhance the proﬁtability of e. g. storage units and therewith attract more investment in such ﬂexible capacities. But on the other hand, the more ﬂexibility is provided to the mar- ket the smaller the spreads between the quarter-hours will be. Hence, the required mix of different measures to meet the future level of system ﬂexibility will only be reached at lowest cost if an appropriate market design is in place that enables a technology-neutral competition between all ﬂexibility alternatives (Brunner 2014, p. 8). This perception is also shared by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy, which published the white paper “An electricity market for Germany’s energy transition” in 2015 showing ﬁrst approaches to develop a market design that fosters ad- ditional ﬂexibilities in a competitive environment. It can be expected that if the future energy system be- comes more ﬂexible it is also likely to affect the trading volumes and therewith the price structure and sensitivities of today’s spot markets for power. Hence, the introduction of a quarter-hourly intraday auction is a ﬁrst step towards an adequate market design for energy systems with a high share of variable RES. And it may serve as a possible role model for other countries with liberalized energy markets, particularly when seeking to increase their share of solar power generation. But there are also other market mecha- nisms, such as additional intraday clearing auctions that are already in place in Spain (see Table 1), Portugal or Italy. Again, further research is needed to evaluate which set of market instruments and new spot products in future electric- ity markets is needed to integrate higher shares of variable RES most sufﬁcient and thus improve the economic wel- fare. 6Conclusion This paper analyzes and calculates the price sensitivity on the newly introduced quarter-hourly intraday auction in comparison to the already existing hourly day-ahead auc- tion in Germany. The results show that between 100 and 800 MW additional bid and ask quantity the average price sensitivity of the quarter-hourly German intraday auction in 2015 (2016) was about 1.5 C/MWh (1.3 C/MWh) per 100 MW shift on supply or demand in comparison to about 0.25 C/MWh (0.2 C/MWh) per 100 MW for the similar shifts on the hourly German-Austrian day-ahead auction. The solar power production as well as gradients of demand and the ramps of thermal power plants have been identiﬁed as the main drivers in terms of trading volume and price formation in the quarter-hourly market. Furthermore, the introduction of the intraday auction increased the overall short-term trading volume and enables risk mitigation to more adequate products, especially for solar power traders. However, the information on the price sensitivity is also rel- evant for other market participants, e. g. operators of ﬂex- ible units, on the supply and demand side likewise since a further change of the present market design is likely to affect their future market behavior. In addition, the discus- sion about the zigzag price formation on the quarter-hourly market points out that the two-stage market design is ratio- nale. But, although it might be possible that clearing both markets together could reduce quarter-hourly price ﬂuctua- tions, the thereby induced reduction of quarter-hourly price spreads is going to lessen investment incentives for new ﬂexibilities that are required to enable even high shares of RES in the future.
