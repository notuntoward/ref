In this regard, this study investigated the extent to which country-level factors in the political, economic, and sociocultural domains correlate with the level of altruism presented by a country at large, based on cross-referencing data from the 2012 Gallup World Poll Global Preference Survey (GPS)’s global altruistic scoring survey with data for the political, economic, and sociocultural domains in 2012 or adjacent years from various institutions or research initiatives including World Bank, Center for Systemic Peace, World Value Survey, and Hofstede Insights. In a sample of 76 countries, this study provides evidence that 1) authoritarian countries are more likely to show elevated altruism scores compared to democratic countries, 2) fewer democratic countries show a higher level of altruism scores, 3) countries with a higher GDP are showing a higher level of altruism than countries with a lower GDP, and 4) countries with a higher level of trust attitudes show a higher level of altruism scores. However, income inequality is not significantly correlated with altruism scores. Further, collectivism is not significantly correlated with altruism scores. The study’s findings suggest that altruism is likely to be linked with political factors related to a country’s political system. Moreover, altruism is somewhat associated with economic GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS iv and sociocultural factors, given the evidence that people living in countries with a higher GDP and a higher level of trust attitudes are more likely to show altruistic attitudes than their counterparts. However, income inequality and collectivism are less likely to be attributes of altruism. By identifying the country-level factors related to altruism across countries, this study provides a better understanding of what triggers ones’ altruism.

Whether it is educational service learning, community support projects or corporate social responsibility initiatives, individuals are coming together in mass to promote causes aimed at enhancing the lives of others (Atkins et al., 2019). This begs the questions: what motivating factors are driving participation, how intrinsic is the compulsion for doing good coded into our D.N.A., and what variables come into play at the macro-level to promote or dissuade societies separated by drawn borders to embrace prosocial initiatives? Statement of the Problem A large body of literature documents a range of factors related to individuals’ prosocial behaviors within a specific community, region or country, but the literature lacks an aspect of how country-level factors are associated with country-level prosocial behaviors around the globe (Luria et al., 2015). The lack of literature on this aspect could yield a narrow view of the sources of prosocial behaviors, thereby limiting ones’ horizons (Rowe, 2014). In this sense, it is worth exploring the cross-country components associated with prosocial actions across countries in an effort to see the bigger picture of human altruism. Accordingly, this study attempts to expand the body of knowledge regarding country-level altruism and relevant factors around the globe. Through identifying the relationships between known political, economic and social factors in GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 2 various societies globally and altruistic willingness of said societies, this study’s goal is to show environmental or situational forces that promote or restrict altruistic actions across countries. Purpose of the Study The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which country-level factors in the political, economic and social domains are correlated with the level of altruism across countries. The following research questions will guide the study. Research Questions Research Question 1. To what extent are political factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? Research Question 1-1. Is there a significant difference in the level of altruism between countries with and without democracy? Research Question 1-2. To what extent are the degree of democracy and the age of democracies associated with the level of altruism? Research Question 2. To what extent are economic factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? Research Question 2-1. To what extent is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) correlated with the level of altruism? Research Question 2-2. To what extent is income inequality correlated with the level of altruism? Research Question 3. To what extent are sociocultural factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? Research Question 3-1. To what extent is the level of trust attitudes correlated with the level of altruism across countries? GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 3 Research Question 3-2. To what extent is the level of collectivist values correlated with the level of altruism across countries? Theoretical Framework Research provides evidence that country-level factors including religion and politics affect overall altruism rating at the country level. For example, studies show that countries with higher ratings of religious devoutness positively influence both religious and non-religious citizens to be more likely to act altruistically (Ruiter & De Graff, 2006) without the expectation of a stranger providing any type of reward for doing so (Bennett & Elinof, 2017). Another study demonstrates that political altruism tends to be triggered by ones’ network to support marginalized populations to which they themselves, friends or families are connected (Giugni & Grasso, 2019). Further, political systems may play a role in increased altruistic volunteerism due to an extended history of formal volunteerism (Grönlund, 2013) while welfare models across political systems are more likely to influence the type of volunteerism rather than the rates of volunteerism (Sokolowski, 2003). Based on the evidence showing a linkage between country- level factors and altruistic action, I propose the following framework focusing on political, economic and sociocultural contributions of a country to its altruistic scoring. In order to better understand some of the factors that may impact a country's altruistic ratings, this study focuses a wide range of potentially contributing variables into three (3) distinct categories: political, economic and sociocultural. These categories often define a regional identity, which represent a breadth of societal influencers including the governance of a region, the distribution of wealth, and sociocultural factors that shape the way individual citizens live their day-to-day lives (Paasi, 1986). Each category is indeterminably expansive in research areas GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 4 deserving of closer evaluation. However, this specific study will focus on high level factors inspired by existing research in the political, economic and sociocultural realms including: 1) democracy vs. authoritarianism, the degree of democracy, and age of democracy as political factors, 2) gross domestic product (GDP) and income inequality as economic factors, and 3) trust attitudes and collectivist values as sociocultural factors. Political Factors. Given evidence that participants from former communist countries of Eastern Europe are more likely to show volunteerism compared to older democracies of Western Europe (Musick & Wilson, 2008), this study expects that the level of altruism differs by a political system of whether, the extent to which, and how long a country is governed by democracy or authoritarianism. Further, individuals tend to show altruistic behaviors towards in- groups by scarifying themselves when they are threatened by another group (out-groups), which refers to parochial altruism (Rusch et al., 2016). Parochial altruism is linked with a “them versus us” mentality that incorporates political altruism; specifically, individuals are more likely to show altruistic political actions toward a group of people whose identities or self-interests are related to individuals themselves (Giugni & Crasso, 2019). In this context, political repression heightens citizens’ altruistic actions to support the survival of in-groups, or a certain population related to their identities or self-interests (Thalhammer, 2001). A synthesis of the aforementioned studies pose the following hypothesis: those living in authoritarian countries with less democracy are more likely to show altruistic behaviors toward in-groups or a certain population related to their identities or self-interests. Economic Factors. A handful of studies have focused on investigating the relationship between a nation’s altruism and economic factors. Klavans and Boyack (2017) found that national wealth as measured by GDP is not significantly associated with national research GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 5 focusing on altruistic motives. On the other hand, a study shows that countries with higher income inequality are less likely to provide social welfare programs related to health care, income assistance food stamps, and employment benefits, the programs of which represent the degree of altruism (Lynch et al., 2001). Given that there is a significant inverse correlation between income inequality as measured by Gini coefficient and Gross National Income (GNI), it reasons that wealthy countries are more likely to show a higher level of altruism (Materia et al., 2005). Indeed, Simms Dphil and Persaud (2009) provide evidence that countries with a higher GDP are more likely to distribute their wealth toward marginalized populations by implementing a range of social welfare programs. In this sense, this study hypothesizes that countries with a higher GDP are more likely to show a higher level of altruism than countries with a lower GDP. Sociocultural Factors. Trust attitude is deemed a sociocultural factor (Grönlund, 2013; Searle, 1995). Given several studies’ findings that ones’ level of trust toward others is a driving source of showing altruistic actions toward others (Chen et al., 2014; Johnson & Mislin, 2011; Kao & Sek-Hong, 1993), it is expected that country-level altruism positively correlates with country-level trust attitudes. Lastly, the degree of collectivism is also considered a region’s cultural factor referring to the degree of being tolerant for social order or harmony by scarifying an individual’s freedom, showing loyalty to an in-group such as family or tribe, and identifying ones’ self-image as “we” rather than “I” (Hofstede et al., 2010). Hofstede et al. suggest that collective or individual values are linked with ones’ attitudes or behaviors. Echoing Hofstede et al.’s study, Klavans and Boyack (2017) provided evidence that altruistic research is more associated with individualistic culture as measured by Hofstede et al.’s (2010) Individualism Index. Contrary to Klavans and Boyack’s evidence, Kao and Sek-Hong (1993) argue that in East Asian societies including China and Japan, altruistic trust tends to be decreasing gradually, in GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 6 part because individualist values permeate collectivist East Asian societies experiencing a substantial economic growth and affluence. The previous studies’ mixed findings could not pose a unidirectional hypothesis of whether there is a positive or negative relationship between collectivism vs. individualism and altruism actions. However, based on a significant correlation between the two factors in the previous studies, this study forms a hypothesis that the level of collectivist values is correlated with the level of altruism across countries. Piliavin and Charng (1990) speak of altruistic motivation as a multifaceted concept that goes beyond evolutionary imperatives to support kin-centric ends, while altruism is part of human nature. Based on a synthesis of literature, Piliavin and Charng conclude that altruistic motivation could be sourced from ones’ individual factors such as personality, while there would be mediating or situational factors that trigger ones’ altruistic behaviors. The lens of this new study will focus on the mediating or situational country-level factors which have been comparatively less documented in the extant literature compared to ones’ individual factors. The mediating and situational country-level factors encompass the sociocultural, economic, and political independent variables that are associated with the dependent variable of a given country’s probability of acting altruistically. Figure 1 provides the theoretical framework that guides the research questions proposed. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 7 Figure 1. Country-Level Factors Associated with Altruism Methodology Data will be leveraged from the 2012 Global Preferences Survey (GPS) to establish a standard country-based altruistic score across 76 different countries. The altruistic scores will be cross-referenced with data for the independent variables in Research Questions 1-3 that are originally sourced from World Bank, Center for Systemic Peace for a Measure of the Political regime (https://www.systemicpeace.org/inscrdata.html), World Value Survey (https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV6.jsp), and Hofstede Insights GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 8 (https://www.hofstede-insights.com/product/compare-countries/) from the same or adjacent period. Quantitative analyses will be conducted to investigate the aforementioned research questions. For Research Question 1-1, independent sample T-tests will be performed to compare altruism scores between countries with and without democracy if normality assumption is met. If normality assumption is not met, the Mann-Whitney U test, which is the nonparametric equivalent to the independent sample T-test, will be conducted. In Research Questions 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, and 3-2, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient tests will be run to identify if normality assumption is met. If normality assumption is not met, the Spearman’s rank-order correlation will be used, which is the nonparametric equivalent to the Pearson product-moment correlation.

Assumptions In this study the dependent variable dataset will be compiled from the 2012 Gallup World Poll Global Preference Survey. Due to the surveys being collected from such a large swath of the planet intentionally crossing a multitude of cultures, political situations and languages, there are numerous variables that could have impacted the survey recipients. Assumptions of consistency in data collection and recording practices being executed accurately and ethically are critical. All responses are assumed to be provided free of external influence or monetary compensation. Translations are assumed to be executed appropriately in both verbiage and deeper cultural meaning. Careful consideration was given to adapting the hypothetical rewards leveraged in the survey questions to be culturally appropriate which also implies the survey was not distributed verbatim to every participant (Falk et al, 2018). It is assumed those alterations were made appropriately. Lastly, all GPS surveys were self-reported hypotheticals so the data cannot definitively answer the question of what a participant would actually do or has done in a given situation, but rather how an individual either believes they would react or wishes to convey they would react. Limitations The dataset utilized limits responses to the year 2012 or adjacent years in the event 2012 data is not available. Samples are extrapolated to represent much larger populations and were by no means comprehensive. In addition, the time and resources required to collect the data was finite which limited which countries and how many participants in said countries could be reached for interview. Data could only be collected from those willing to participate which may GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 12 slant the results to those accessible by traditional means of telephone or face-to-face interview. In addition to the survey questions and respondents themselves, the data was segmented by territory which, in time, may have their borders shift. Political affiliations, major environmental or social events may have taken place or be in the process of taking place during the survey process which could lead to situational differences inside of the same country from those who participated at different times or participants’ comfort level in answering. Finally, data was also collected from multiple sources using differing techniques designed to best suit the cultural norms and voice of the territory. Delimitations The data used for this study was collected from an external source in an existing dataset. The time period length was confined as it encapsulates responses from the year 2012. Only 76 countries participated in GPS. This study will not look at individual factors such as personality or any other personal antecedents of those surveyed and will not look to establish patterns over multiple years or generational shifts. Significance of the Study As addressed previously, although several previous studies focus on individual-level factors, few focus on country-level factors (Luria et al., 2015). Piliavin and Charng’s (1990) general theoretical framework of altruism posits that there are mediating or situational factors associated with altruistic behaviors. As mediating or situational factors, however, few studies focused on the country-level factor that will speak to the consistency implied by evolutionary altruism or aid in determining the impact of particular variables that could be viewed to potentially increase altruistic action at larger scales. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 13 Organization of the Study This study is segmented into five distinct chapters. Chapter One provides an overview of the study, statement of the problem, purpose of the study, research questions, theoretical framework, methodology, definitions of terminology, assumptions, limitations, delimitations and the significance of the study. Chapter Two contains the literature review which includes reviews of a general overview of altruism, the multiple dimensions of altruism, the altruistic spectrum, implicit motivations, global altruistic factors, religion/geographical devoutness and an introduction to the 2012 GPS data collection methodology that will be leveraged as this study’s primary dataset. In Chapter Three, the methodology of the study is broken down by research questions, design of the study, selection of participants, instrumentation, data collection, data analysis, and a summation of data review. Chapter Four will present the findings of the study and will answer the research questions established in Chapter One. Finally, Chapter Five provides a summary and interpretation of the findings and discussion on implication for practices, limitation of the study, and future research. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 14 Chapter 2: Literature Review This chapter reviews the literature about altruism. This section is structured as follows. Beginning with the theories related to altruism, previous studies provide an overview of factors associated with altruism. Then, a rationale for proposing the current study is addressed. Theoretical Framework While a considerable number of studies have been devoted to identifying “sources” of altruistic behaviors over the past several decades, there is still debate over whether altruistic behavior is an egoistic motive that is eventually advantageous to an actor or is part of human nature that is not derived from an actor’s self-interest (Draguns, 2013). Nevertheless, Draguns (2013) argues that evidence from experimental studies published over the past three decades is consistent with Piliavin and Charng’s (1990) notion that altruism is part of human nature. General Overview. Piliavin and Charng (1990) offer an overview of altruism in their literature review pertaining to the topic, challenging the conventional wisdom from the prior decades asserting that altruistic actions are triggered from an underlying egoistic motivation. Their review suggests that altruism should be viewed as a multifaceted concept that is intertwined with a range of antecedent, mediating and situational factors. Namely, a wide range of factors shape true altruism (which is deemed human nature). Fehr and Fischbacher (2003) argue that, while experimental evidence supports the notion that human altruism exists, there is an individual difference in the degree of altruism as being affected by a wide range of factors. In an effort to identify antecedents, a considerable number of studies have focused on motivating factors for prosocial behavior including an altruistic personality and the development and shape of altruism from childhood through adulthood (Piliavin & Charng, 1990). In work performed GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 15 throughout the 1970-90s, a convergence of ideas from economists, sociologists, biologists and other interested field specialists put that general skepticism of a singular inherent evolutionary impulse to the test by defining and developing experiments to identify an “altruistic personality.” Multiple Dimensions of Altruism. As altruism is a multifaceted concept, altruism could not be defined as a single dimension, suggesting that a combination of different parameters should be incorporated into the definition of altruism (Piliavin & Charng, 1990). Altruism could be performed under the influence of social expectations. Otherwise, altruism could be triggered spontaneously and without deliberate consideration for the potential benefits or sacrifices made toward oneself. Although motivating factors that drive ones’ altruistic acts may differ, the social benefits of the acts themselves are indifferent to the motivation of the individual actor executing the act. These spontaneous or organic impulses were believed to be rooted in evolutionary imperatives to support the survival of one’s bloodline or humanity as a whole, though the potential influence of social or career reward always serves to incentivize and amplify those impulses. However, two common and distinct principles that relate to altruistic acts: an aware actor knowingly making a decision and an action that benefits others more than that actor is directly benefitted. When this is applied back to the altruistic spectrum of egoist to altruist, it provides goalposts to which we can begin to assess varying levels of benefit and awareness of motivation and sacrifice. Sober (1988) further branches altruism into “evolutionary” and “vernacular” forms. Evolutionary Altruism emphasizing the consequences on both the actor executing the action and the recipient(s) benefiting from the action where Vernacular Altruism is more focused on motives for an actor executing a prosocial behavior to benefit others. As cited by Piliavin & Charng (1990), Sober (1989) argued that Evolutionary Altruism could be driven by situations GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 16 where a certain group competes against other groups and an individual is willing to sacrifice for the needs of the group with which they most closely identify. In this regard, Evolutionary Altruism could be in conjunction with Parochial Altruism which refers to an individual’s high level of cooperative and altruistic behaviors toward in-group members paired with hostile attitudes toward out-group members in an effort to achieve a common goal of in-group superiority amid competition against out-groups (Rusch et al., 2016). In line with Parochial Altruism, if there is a situation wherein ones’ collective (in-groups) is seen as being threatened by another collective (out-groups), one might show true altruism by knowingly sacrificing their own comfort/safety/etc. to benefit unrelated individuals for the opposing collective (groups). This is the quintessential “them versus us” mentality that causes strains across geographic, political and cultural swaths of society. Such mentality may incorporate political altruism that is defined by Passy (2001) with the following actions: (a) performed collectively, (b) that have a political aim, and (c) five altruistic orientations as conceptualized by Bar-Tal (Bar-Tal 1985-86) that include (a) must benefit to other persons, (b) must be performed voluntarily, (c) must be performed intentionally, (d) the benefit must be the goal by itself, and (e) must be performed without expecting any external reward. In relation to political altruism, Giugni and Grasso (2019) found that study participants tend to show altruistic political actions toward marginalized populations who are related to identities of study participants themselves or their friends or family in a survey of 2,000 respondents in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, and the UK. Specifically, the authors found that 1) those who are themselves non-citizens or have family, friends or acquaintances from other countries are more likely to support refugees and asylum seekers, 2) unemployed participants and/or those with unemployed family, friends or GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 17 acquaintances are more likely to engage in political actions supporting unemployed population, and 3) participants with disabilities or those who have family, friends or acquaintances with disabilities are more likely to advocate people with disabilities. Altruism and Political Factors. If altruism is assumed to be reflexive in nature and not inherently dictated by social expectations, then one might assume the level of altruism to be relatively consistent around the globe regardless of differing cultural norms. Other economic or social variables would therefore be expected to have limited correlation with the altruistic drivers of the citizens if it were truly a combination of impulse and personality embedded into humanity to support the propagation of the species. Specifically, if there is a situation wherein ones’ collective (in-groups) is seen as being threatened by another collective (out-groups), ones might show true altruism by knowingly sacrificing their own comfort/safety/etc. to benefit unrelated individuals for the opposing collective (groups). Altruism and Economic Factors. One study shows mixed findings in regard to the relationship between national-level economic or social variables and altruism (Kalavans & Boyack, 2017). Using data drawn from research papers indexed in Scopus database published from 2010 to 2013, national research profiles grounded in altruistic motives are not correlated with national wealth as measured by GDP (Klavans & Boyack, 2017), suggesting that economic factors are less likely to be related to altruistic motives of conducting research. On the other hand, Klavans and Boyack found that altruistic research is positively correlated with education as measured by United Nations Education Index, individualistic culture as measured by Hofstede Center Individualism Index, and religion as measured by percentage of Christians, suggesting that social or cultural factors are likely to be linked with altruistic motives of conducting research. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 18 Altruism and Sociocultural Factors. Studies show that altruism is associated with trust attitudes in various contexts. For example, Johnson and Mislin (2011) found that a review of approximately 23,000 participants across 35 countries participating in variations on the Berg, Dickhaut and McCabe (BDM) trust game illustrated the impact of minor variations influencing the trust outcomes substantially. The general formula for the BDM is a multi-stage investment/trust experiment wherein pairs of individuals are divided into ‘sender’ and ‘receiver’. The person assigned the role of sender is provided a monetary reward and asked to send a portion to the receiver. Once the receiver gains the funds, that reward is tripled, and they are then asked if they would like to send any percentage back to the initial sender. The amount initially sent from the sender to the receiver is considered the measure of trust as there is no guarantee they will receive any of that reward back while the returner’s decision of what percentage to provide back to the initial sender is viewed as a measure of reciprocity. The findings concluded that a number of variables impacted willingness to trust including the reward being reduced from 3x to 2x the initial value, to whether or not the participant is a student, whether the sender is also asked to act as a receiver in another experiment or if the eventual payout would be certain or randomized. This inconsistency in outcomes shows the fluidity of altruism and trust at even the most basic level. Further, Chen et al. (2014) provide evidence that altruism moderates the relationship between community trust and knowledge sharing intention. In their research, approximately 300 teachers in Taiwan leveraging a virtual knowledge sharing platform were surveyed. Since the platform was entirely virtual, a general anonymity was at the center of the experiment which forced the participants to initially trust more in the general community than the individual contributors. The teachers who reported having higher levels of community trust were also more GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 19 likely to share knowledge due in part to their self-reported level of altruism. Participants who rated their enjoyment for helping others more highly showed a higher prevalence of both community trust and knowledge sharing intention. Kao and Sek-Hong (1993) argue that collectivism is associated with altruistic actions in workplace settings as it relates to literal and psychological contracts as well as levels of high- trust between employee and employer. The general idea being that collectivist communities better align their workforce into more flexible roles and an inherent trust is placed in the corporation that the work being done is beneficial to all involved. The individualist alternative is the practice of strictly worded contracts and clearly defined fixed, responsibilities that undercut trust between employee and employer. The concept of high trust allows the worker to believe their sacrifice will be rewarded over time by the organization. This collectivist approach is more prevalent in Eastern cultures as Kao and Sek-Hong refer to China and Japanese traditional work environments where the individualistic approach is a more Western norm. These assumptions of good faith and willingness to cooperate with management and embrace change in collectivist organizations align with levels of altruistic temperament that Kao and Sek-Hong refer to as an awareness of others while the Western altruistic temperament corresponds with the increased levels of individualism that are more in line with expectations of social obligations rather than a general compulsion to support the collective community. Likewise, Munroe (2018) found that collectivist cultures are likely to promote altruistic attitudes in a sample of approximately 200 children from Belize, Kenya, Nepal, and American Samoa. When researchers provided children representing these four distinct communities with a monetary reward, they told each child that they knew of a family who had experienced a fire in their home recently and lost everything. They then asked if the child would be willing to donate GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 20 any of the money they were about to receive to the children of that family. The research found that, not only did the two countries whose cultures were more in-line with collectivist values offer more to the hypothetical family in need, but that the amount donated was in line with the degree to which each community found themselves on a collectivist to individualist spectrum. This supports the theory that collectivism will generally correlate more positively with altruistic action. Altruistic Spectrum Prior studies provide evidence that personality traits serve as an antecedent of Public Service Motivation (PSM). In a literature review by Piatrak and Holt (2020), PSM is found to be dependent on the altruism and egoism spectrum associated with the Big Five personality traits as measured by extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism; furthermore, it is also influenced by external motives beyond these traits. These external motives tend to surface behind an individuals’ inherent traits and can be difficult to parse from a purely external view. The inherent traits are often framed by the HEXACO model which is comprised of six dimensions: Honesty-humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to experience. Specifically, previous studies provide evidence that PSM is associated with the following three dimensions of HEXACO: Honesty-humility, Emotionality and Agreeableness (Piatrak & Holt, 2020). Moynihan et al. (2015) address the subjective well-being (SWB) of individuals included in prosocial exercises. It is posited that prosocial motivation and PSM are founded in humanity’s need to support their society through altruistic acts. In Moynihan et al.’s work, they also refer to Titmuss (1971) who suggests that, at its core, altruism is an investment in one’s own self- interest. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 21 Implicit Motivation In Simpson and Willer’s (2008) study, they explored antecedents of prosocial behaviors beyond the early kin-centric prosocial motives of Hamilton (1964) and Trivers (1971) through the later indirect reciprocity theories of Alexander (1987) and Nowak (2006). Simpson and Willer’s findings go beyond the inherent evolutionary benefit of performing prosocial works and ask what motivates individuals to act outside of their obvious self-interest when the parties benefiting the most are unable to reciprocate versus the direct reciprocity of an actor being motivated by previous experience or personal perceived or literal debts to the cause. Empirical data supports both, that an actor known to have acted pro-socially is conferred important advantages and that potential benefactors leverage the existence or absence of pro- sociality in the level of cooperation they are willing to project. This led to their study on reputational incentivization in prosocial volunteerism as differentiated between altruistic and egoistic participants. Their findings supported the theory that altruists give more and are less impacted by reputational incentives when compared to egoists in both their own personal behaviors and those of peers (Simpson & Willer, 2008). In a later review of literature by Simpson and Willer (2015), the establishment of social norms is addressed through the foundational lens of three key mechanisms: rules, reputations and relations. They describe the utility of the mechanisms, in part, as bringing the behaviors of the more self-interested in line with the larger goals of society (Simpson & Willer, 2015). Where motivation plays a role in why these norms are followed, ultimately, it appears that the desired social outcomes are indifferent to that driving force that leads to the altruistic act. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 22 Simpson and Willer’s review also examines the ability of an institution to distort or undermine norms and/or reactions to prosocial behavior. Included in their review is the work of Bowles (2008) who argues that a policy designed and enforced for self-interested actors may very well generate self-interested actors by fiat. This can take the form of monetary or other pre- established incentives provided to encourage prosocial action. The introduction of contracts also carries the potential for denigrating trust even after the contract has been removed (Simpson & Willer, 2015). Simpson and Willer cite a study undergone by Falk & Szech (2013), wherein participants who dealt in competitive market interactions as part of their career were found to be more willing to allow a healthy mouse to be killed as a result of an exchange. This was purported to be due, in part, to the egoistic norms of trading (Simpson & Willer, 2015). The propagation of a foundational understanding that winning inherently implies someone else losing establishes a culture of risk, self-interest and sacrifice. The inverse has been supported by studies involving compensation for blood donation and potential waste repository sites in England and Switzerland; when compensation was used as an incentive, donation rates and willingness to accept given repository sites both dropped (Simpson, 2015). This reaction further underscores the complexity of motivation in prosocial action as it relates to the internal drivers of sacrifice and reward especially when relating to the motives and outcomes created by corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs. Global Altruistic Factors Norms and incentives are heavily influenced by regional culture. The building blocks of religion, history, economy and governance all play critical roles in the expectations and consequences of one’s actions. In Nederveen Pieterse’s (2020) evaluation of how the GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 23 conversation on global culture has evolved over the past 30-years using Featherstone’s Global Culture: Nationalism, Globalization and Modernity (1990) and the Theory Culture & Society (1990-2020) journal as his framework, he speaks of the need to separate empiricism and embrace diversity in the lens through which we view all cultures. With the increase in global capitalism of the 1980s and 1990s paired with increased ease of communications with the prevalence of the internet and other mass method technologies at the turn of the century, the hard cartographic lines of the past began to blur. Nederveen Pieterse identified three major paradigms of globalization and culture – differentialism (clashes are inevitable), universalism (convergence on a center) and hybridization. He also refers to this complexity of variables as an “opaque causality” that muddies any clear differentiation (lines of cause and effect) between regional cultures through a globalist lens (Nederveen Pieterse, 2020) Due to this constant and often sudden fluctuation in motivators and influences, any review of a global study must be done in the rear-view as a snapshot rather than a current trend. However, an appreciation for the influence of nationalism remains essential due to the extensive decision-making capacity and tribal influence of a given populous involved in any multi-national economic or social overlap. This perpetuates the segmentation of norms along political, if not historically cultural, lines. In Altruism in Cross-Cultural Perspective (Vakoch Ed. 2013) (AiCCP) conceptual spectrums are discussed relating to cultural simplicity vs cultural complexity, cultural tightness vs cultural looseness and vertical hierarchical cultures vs horizontal hierarchical cultures. The ways in which cultures vary between a collectivist and individualist framework rely on various spectrums including intellectual capacity, population density, resource scarcity, and value structure. For instance, Triandis (2013) posits that even horizontally hierarchical individualist GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 24 cultures (valuing individual uniqueness) would express higher levels of national altruism than vertically hierarchical collectivist cultures (valuing achievement and competition). These conversations of vertical and horizontal, individualist or collectivist, are most often used to define the inner workings of a subset of society. The willingness of members of a society to break from their in-group to support those in an out-group can also apply to these guidelines. In Altruism in Cross-Cultural Perspective, Triandis cites one of his previous pieces when discussing findings of collectivists being more likely to help in-group than out-group individuals. This may be a result of established social norms geared toward supporting the group and the inherent benefits that support funnels back to the individual as part of strengthening that society, however historical, religious and economic variables all play a valuable role. Chiu and Hong’s (2006) Social Psychology of Culture work is cited by Triandis to discuss the distinction between obligatory aide and optional assistance. In North America, this impacts who one is willing to help on a case-by-case basis and is seen as an event deserving of praise where a norm in India is tied to a moral or religious obligation which flattens the personal selection of who is to be aided and rejects gratitude. Smith et al. (2013) discuss the influence of television and societal communication on altruism by developing a coding system to identify forms and depth of altruistic behavior on the screen. Altruism is defined in these contexts as voluntary actions that benefit others and fall outside the occupational roles of the actor. Smith et al. begin by segmenting altruistic behavior into five dimensions: concern (level of self-interest), cost (sacrifice), benefit to the recipient (direct gain), empathy and ease of escape (social repercussions of not taking action). Composites were created from most liberal to most conservative. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 25 Grönlund (2013) takes these parameters further by assessing volunteerism on a more global scale. The concept of volunteering is addressed as varying from country to country, but that the fundamental understanding of what it means to volunteer is understood cross-culturally. Importantly, Grönlund discusses the flux of motivation. That motivational structures and internal values guide both self-serving and other-oriented participants. Cultural values influence these personal values through institutionalization and an individual’s tacit understanding of the world. Where it is important to appreciate the ever-shifting norms of a culture, each society will produce a series of dominant cultural values. To combat the difficulty of cross-cultural research, empirical studies have been performed that are viewed through two key factors: structural factors (experience with democracy, political system, economic development, etc.) and cultural factors (individualism, religiosity and trust). Grönlund highlights the debate on the influence of democracy on volunteerism with some, including Curtis, Baer Grabb in 2001 as well as Halman in 2003 arguing long-standing democratic regimes will show higher rates of volunteerism due to their long history of formal volunteerism where others like Ziemeck in 2003 argue that countries without democratic governance will experience heightened levels of volunteerism. Communist countries often have compulsory volunteerism as part of a political structural norm which introduces a larger debate of whether or not this can be considered actual volunteering or rather simply obligatory, unpaid labor. Grönlund also cites a Musick & Wilson’s (2008) study “Volunteers: A Social Profile”, that found increasing levels of volunteerism in former communist countries of Eastern Europe while rates in the older democracies of Western Europe are in decline. Political systems are discussed as topics for contemporary debate, however, Grönlund refers to a Salamon & GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 26 Sokolowski’s (2003) study wherein welfare models are shown more to influence the types of volunteering taking place rather than the participation rates of volunteerism. Religion and Geographical Devoutness This same approach is found in societal religious norms in that, though religious teachings vary, they are more likely to alter how one volunteers than whether or not they choose to volunteer citing a Ruiter and De Graff’s (2006) study finding that both religious and non- religious actors are positively influenced in devout nations though the perceived ultimate reward for religious individuals would be much greater. A more recent study by Bennett and Elinof (2017) provided evidence that religion and the general religious devoutness of a country play a critical role in the probability of an individual to help a stranger without the expectation of reward based on a multilevel analysis of 179,961 respondents from 126 countries. Bennett and Elinof found that those most likely to help a stranger across the religious spectrum, in order of most likely to least were: Jews, Muslims, Orthodox Christians, members of other religions, Buddhists, Protestants, Catholics, non-affiliated followed by Hindus. However, in countries rated as more devout, there was a positive statistical significance in both the religious and non-affiliated communities with the non-affiliated being more heavily influenced. These points cross cultural and geographic lines, pushing back on the concept of an inherent in- group mentality for pro-social action. By asking respondents to speak toward a time in the prior month they had helped a stranger, it mitigated the probability that the individual being helped was due to their personal religious affiliation, but it did not go as far as to contribute to the geographic in-group versus out-group preference as country-based religiousness showed a positive correlation on the culture as a whole. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 27 Introduction of Global Preferences Survey (GPS) Though extensive research has been performed at the local levels to quantify the antecedent motivations for altruistic actions between individuals, it is heavily westernized and done at the personal, micro-level utilizing small groupings as subjects. This leaves a gap in the literature facing how altruism varies on a global macro-scale. The Global Preferences Survey (GPS) conducted in 2012 was developed to measure heterogeneity of preference variation by country. Approximately 80,000 participants, across 76 different countries with a median sample size of 1,000 participants per country answered both qualitative and quantitative surveys translated to suit their region. By leveraging the altruistic scaling provided by Falk et al. (2018), we can identify correlations between larger scale variables and GPS findings. GPS Data Collection Methodology. To ensure global coverage reliability, the 76 countries represented in the GPS sample account for 90% of the world population. Both qualitative and quantitative data was collected from the representative population samples within each country capturing: time preference, risk preference, altruism, positive reciprocity, negative reciprocity and trust. The study also included 22 pre-tests in culturally heterogeneous countries to increase confidence in various cultural heritages’ abilities to interpret the surveys, standardized elicitation and develop translation techniques through the pre-existing infrastructure of the 2012 Gallup World Poll. (Falk et al., 2018) The initial results as reported by Falk (2018) found distinct “preference profile” groupings of countries around particular preferences. For example, the research team found higher levels of patience in European and English-speaking countries, increased willingness to take risks in African and Middle Eastern respondents and elevated levels of prosocial action GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 28 across Asia. Additionally, within-country variation often outweighed between-country variations supporting the idea that evolutionary theories of altruism may be inherent in individuals, regardless of nurturing effects. All surveys were translated into the local languages of the participants with 58 countries conducting interviews mostly face-to-face while 18 countries primarily used telephone interviews. The monetary values mentioned in the survey prompts were also adjusted to match the median household income value and regional denomination to protect consistency in respondents. Of the GPS’s six measured preferences, the focus for this study will revolve around the results pertaining to altruism. Two altruism-focused questions were asked to all respondents: one qualitative and one quantitative. The former asked how willing the respondent would be to donate to a good cause without expecting anything in return on an 11-point Likert scale. The latter asked each respondent if they were to unexpectedly receive 1,000 euros (or equitable amount and denomination determined by region), how much of that amount would they choose to donate. Based on these responses, each participant was given a score which was then aggregated with their fellow countrymen and then provided a ranking of -1 to 1. Summary In summation, the enormity of cross-cultural variables and the barriers in identifying genuine intent have made altruistic motivation difficult to quantify and predictive variables more difficult to isolate. To more deeply explore the 20th century focus on kin-centric evolutionary motivations one would need to collect and correlate data at an insurmountable scale. However, efforts have been taken to study prosocial motivations at the local levels and, in the case of the GPS, at a macro level globally. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 29 By cross-referencing data collected from the GPS survey, which made concerted efforts to minimize the interference of language, economics and culture on their respondents, with other country-specific quantifiable metrics from World Bank, World Value Survey, and Hofstede Insights, we open up the possibility to explore global altruism through that same macro lens. Focusing on variables like GDP, trust attitudes, and political structure will create segmentations that can then be explored further in future studies. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 30 Chapter 3: Methodology The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which country-level factors in the political, economic and social domains are correlated with the level of altruism across countries. By utilizing archived, public datasets from the same year (or adjacent years when 2012 data is not available), this study will investigate the following research questions: Research Questions (1) To what extent are political factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? (1-1) Is there a significant difference in the level of altruism between countries with and without democracy? (1-2) To what extent are the degree of democracy and the age of democracies associated with the level of altruism? (2) To what extent are economic factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? (2-1) To what extent is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) correlated with the level of altruism? (2-2) To what extent is income inequality correlated with the level of altruism? (3). To what extent are sociocultural factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? (3-1) To what extent is the level of trust attitudes correlated with the level of altruism across countries? GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 31 (3-2) To what extent is the level of collectivist values correlated with the level of altruism across countries? The following sections provide an overview of the public datasets, data analysis process, and means of storing the data. Overview of the Data Our World in Data ([OWD]; https://ourworldindata.org/about), a non-profit organization data lab, has deposited archived data from published articles and various organizations including World Bank and World Value Survey. Using OWD, this study will extract data related to the independent and dependent variables. Note that data originally sourced from various institutions or research projects including Gallup World Poll’s 2012 Global Preferences Survey (GPS), World Bank, Center for Systemic Peace for a Measure of the Political regime, and World Value Survey are extracted from OWD. Collectivistic value scores is extracted from Hofstede Insights (https://www.hofstede-insights.com/product/compare-countries/). Dependent Variable. Seventy-six countries participated in the 2012 GPS, which represents a sampling of 90% of the world’s population. The 2012 GPS is initially found in OWD. Independent Variables. Data for the independent variables in Research Question 1 will be extracted from OWD. Countries with and without democracies will be defined as the age of democracy per country which is originally sourced from Boix et al.’s (2013) study. A country is defined as democratic if it meets the following criteria: “the executive is directly or indirectly elected in popular elections and is responsible either directly to voters or to a legislature, the GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 32 legislature (or the executive if elected directly) is chosen in free and fair elections and a majority of adult men have the right to vote” (Boix et al., 2013, p.1530). With respect to the level of democracy and political regime, OWD provides data extracted from the following two sources: 1) Center for Systemic Peace for a Measure of the Political regime (https://www.systemicpeace.org/inscrdata.html); and 2) Wimmer and Min (2006). With respect to the independent variables in Research Question 2, data for gross domestic product (GDP) is originally sourced from World Bank; GDP is defined as the monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country or region in a specific time period (https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators). Another independent variable is income inequality – Gini index which is also originally sourced from World Bank; income inequality is defined as the empirical evidence of how inequality between incomes has changed over time, and how the level of inequality varies between different countries (https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/poverty-and-equity- database). With respect to the independent variables in Research Question 3, the data for level of interpersonal trust attitudes will be collected by World Values Survey and extracted from Our World in Data (OWD). The variable regarding interpersonal trust is defined by the self-reported responses to the prompt, “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?\" (http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWVL.jsp). Levels of collectivist values will be collected from Hofstede et al., 2010 (https://www.hofstede- insights.com/product/compare-countries/). Accordingly, in this study, both variables serve as country-level factors in the social domains. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 33 Data Analysis At the initial stage, the researcher will test the normality of Altruism, the dependent variable in the study, to determine whether parametric or non-parametric tests will be used. The assumption of normality will be tested based on Skewness and Kurtosis values. If Skewness and Kurtosis values are ranged from -2 to 2, the dependent variable can be assumed to be normally distributed. When the Normality Assumption Meets. To investigate Research Question 1-1, an independent sample T-test, which is a parametric test, will be used to compare Altruism between countries with and without democracy. To investigate Research Questions 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, and 3-2, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, which is a parametric test, will be used. When the Normality Assumption Violates. To investigate Research Question 1-1, the Mann-Whitney U-test, which is a non-parametric test, will be used to compare Altruism between countries with and without democracy. To investigate Research Questions 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, and 3-2, the Kendall or Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient, which is a non-parametric test, will be used. Data Storage and Removal The data utilized will be part of a public data set. It will be saved locally without any confidential information. Summary By compiling multiple datasets from established sources relating to country-level factors focused on a confined timespan, this study will investigate the extent to which country-level factors in the political, economic and social domains are associated with a given country’s GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 34 altruistic rating as provided by Gallup’s 2012 GPS. Examining the relationships will not be predictive of why an individual citizen of a particular country may or may not act altruistically, but it may provide insight into some of the conditions that increase the probability of altruistic actions. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 35 Chapter 4: Findings This chapter presents answers to the proposed research questions presented in prior chapters utilizing the methodology discussed in chapter 3. The data leveraged for each research question is evaluated for equal distribution to determine if parametric or non-parametric methods are required for analysis. The results are presented and any evidence of significant correlation between variables is reported. The proposed research questions are as follows: Research Questions (1) To what extent are political factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? (1-1) Is there a significant difference in the level of altruism between countries with and without democracy? (1-2) To what extent are the degree of democracy and the age of democracies associated with the level of altruism? (2) To what extent are economic factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? (2-1) To what extent is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) correlated with the level of altruism? (2-2) To what extent is income inequality correlated with the level of altruism? (3). To what extent are sociocultural factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? (3-1) To what extent is the level of trust attitudes correlated with the level of altruism across countries? GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 36 (3-2) To what extent is the level of collectivist values correlated with the level of altruism across countries? Data from the 2012 Gallup World Poll Global Preference Survey (GPS) relating to altruism rating by country is utilized as the dependent variable across all research questions. This data is analyzed with descriptive statistics (Table 1) to verify normality and then correlated with the six focused independent variables following their own descriptive review. Research Question One Research Question 1. To what extent are political factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? Research Question 1-1: Is there a significant difference in the level of altruism between countries with and without democracy? To answer research question one, I have analyzed data relating to a country’s government in regard to its authoritarian or democratic leaning. Table 1 Altruism by Country Normalcy Descriptives Statistic Std. Error Mean -.038 .039 95% confidence interval for mean Lower bound -.116 Upper bound .041 5% trimmed mean -.037 Median -.097 Variance .118 GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 37 Std. Deviation .343 Minimum -.940 Maximum .906 Range 1.846 Interquartile range .396 Skewness .174 .276 Kurtosis .505 .545 Distribution is reported to verify normality of the GPS altruism data. In table 1, Skewness and Kurtosis values are .174 and .505, respectively, which fall within the -2 and 2 range. As such, altruism scores are assumed to be normally distributed. With this normality assumption, I then applied independent samples T-test to compare altruism scores between countries with democracy and without democracy. Table 2 T-Test Comparison of Altruism Values and Democracy by Country Group Statistics N Mean Std. Deviation Std. Error Mean Nondemocratic countries 24 .081 .376 .077 Democratic countries 52 -.092 .316 .044 Based on the T-test performed in table 2, citizens within authoritarian countries (nondemocratic) show a higher level of reported altruism compared to those within democratic countries. The mean value for authoritarian countries is .081, while the mean value for GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 38 democratic countries is -.092. This compelled the use of the Levene’s Test for Equality of Variance and T-Test for Equality of Means inferential statistic review. Table 3 Levene’s Test for Equality of Variances and T-Test for Equality of Means of Altruism and Democracy by Country Independent Sample Test F p-value t df p-value (2-tailed) Equal variances assumed 1.679 .199 2.087 74 0.040 Equal variances not assumed . 1.957 38.591 0.058 95% confidence interval of the difference Independent sample test Mean difference Std.

Independent samples T-test shows evidence that citizens from GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 39 authoritarian countries are more likely to show altruism than their counterparts from democratic countries, t(74) = 2.087, p = .04 < .05, Cohen’s d = .498. The effect size in this finding is computed using Cohen’s d formula (Cohen, 1988) as follows: Cohen's d = (M2 - M1) ⁄ SDpooled where SDpooled = √((SD12 + SD22) ⁄ 2) Cohen’s d = .498 suggests that a medium effect based on the following guideline: values of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80 for Cohen’s d are commonly considered small, medium, and large effects, respectively (Cohen, 1988). Research Question 1-2: To what extent are the degree of democracy and the age of democracies associated with the level of altruism? To answer research question 1-2, I analyzed data relating to the number of years each democratic country has operated as a democracy and the degree to which a country is rated as democratic on a spectrum of authoritarian to democratic to determine if there are any significant correlations between degree of democracy and/or the length of time under democracy and altruistic rating. Table 4 Degree of Democracy Normality Descriptives Statistic Std.

In order to research correlation between the degree of democracy and altruism, parametric correlation methods have been employed (Table 5) while investigating the correlation between age of democracy and altruism, a non-parametric correlation method must be leveraged (Table 6).

This infers that younger democracies are not necessarily any more or less altruistic than historied democracies. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 43 Research Question Two Research Question 2. To what extent are economic factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? Research Question 2-1: To what extent is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) correlated with the level of altruism? To address research question two relating to economic variables and their potential influence on altruism, we first evaluate the GDP of a country and its relationship to altruistic score. To reduce the scale, GDP data has been transformed into log10 (GDP) in order to ensure normally distributed data (Table 8). Table 8 Normality of Log10 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Descriptives Statistic Std. Error Mean 11.527 .084 95% confidence interval for mean Lower bound 11.360 Upper bound 11.693 5% trimmed mean 11.519 Median 11.598 Variance 0.524 Std.

GDP data was transformed into log10 in order to make normally distributed data.

GDP data was transformed into log10 (GDP) in order to make normally distributed data. Through descriptive statistics, we identify that GDP is normally distributed based on Skewness and Kurtosis values ranging between -2 and 2. I therefore utilized parametric testing to analyze the relationship between altruism and GDP (Table 9). The Pearson Correlation analysis reports there is a positive significant correlation between GDP and altruism scores, p = .05 at the significance level of α = .05. The correlation coefficient, r = -.192 is considered a small effect as the aforementioned interpretation guideline (Cohen, 1988). GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 45 Research Question 2-2: To what extent is income inequality correlated with the level of altruism? With the knowledge that a country’s GDP does show significant influence on its citizen’s altruistic rating, I then analyzed the impact of income inequality. (Table 10) Table 10 Normality of Income Inequality Descriptives Statistic Std.

Data reported represents a limited sample size of 17 countries with reported levels of income inequality. With a Kurtosis rating outside of the -2 and 2 range required for normality of distributed data I used a non-parametric correlation method to evaluate the relationship between income inequality and altruism by country (Table 11).

It should be noted however that this data represents a smaller sample size of 17 countries that had data relating to income inequality available for analysis. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 47 Research Question Three Research Question 3. To what extent are sociocultural factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? Research Question 3-1: To what extent is the level of trust attitudes correlated with the level of altruism across countries? Independent variables of trust and individualism are applied to identify sociocultural influences on altruism. In question 3-1, the level of trust reported by citizens of each country is evaluated. Table 12 Normality of Trust Descriptives Statistic Std. Error Mean -.022 .032 95% confidence interval for mean Lower bound -.086 Upper bound .041 5% trimmed mean -.024 Median -.081 Variance .077 Std.

I then leveraged the Pearson Correlation parametric testing to explore significance in relationship between trust attitudes and altruism. (Table 12) Based on the results, countries with a higher levels of trust attitudes are more likely to show higher levels of altruism, r = .273, p = .009 at the significance level of α = .01 (Table 13). The correlation coefficient, r = -.273 is considered a small effect but approaching to a moderate effect based on Cohen’s (1988) effect size interpretation guideline. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 49 Research Question 3-2: To what extent is the level of collectivist values correlated with the level of altruism across countries? Lastly, data collected reporting the level of individualism represented in each country is evaluated in relation to altruism score. Table 14 Normality of Individualism Descriptives Statistic Std. Error Mean 39.925 2.733 95% confidence interval for mean Lower bound 34.468 Upper bound 45.382 5% trimmed mean 38.880 Median 33.000 Variance 500.525 Std.

This permits a parametric test to be utilized for statistical inference. In Table 15 we see the Pearson Correlation test found no significant relationship exists between the individual/collectivist culture of a country and its corresponding altruism scores, p = .245 > .05. Summary In summation, significant relationships were identified across multiple independent variables relating to research questions 1-3. In relation to the question regarding to what extent are political factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries, 1) people living in authoritarian countries are significantly more likely to show altruism than people living in democratic countries, and 2) citizens in less democratic countries are more likely to show a higher level of altruism. However, the length of time a country has governed as a democracy did not present any significant correlation in respect to altruism. In relation to the question regarding to what extent are economic factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries, significant positive relationships were found between a country’s GDP and altruism, suggesting GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 51 that those living in countries with higher GDP are showing more altruism than their counterparts living in countries with a lower GDP. Income inequality however did not show any significant correlation to altruism score. Finally, to the question regarding to what extent are sociocultural factors correlated with altruism across countries, elevated trust attitudes did present a significant positive correlation toward altruism where the level of collectivism/individualism of a country did not show a significant relationship with altruism. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 52 Chapter 5: Discussion After reviewing the data regarding specific political, economic and sociocultural variables as they relate to altruism, the findings illustrate both significant correlations and unrelated influence. In the prior chapters, an overview of the study, literature review, methodology and statistical findings are presented. This chapter presents a summary of the study, discussion of the findings, implications for practice, recommendations for future research, and conclusions. By reflecting on the data analyzed throughout this study, the findings related to potential independent variables that impact altruism at the country level are synthesized. Additional research will be recommended to expand the field of study. Summary of the Study The purpose of this study was to expand the body of knowledge relating to altruism and the political, economic and sociocultural factors that influence altruism around the globe. Though extensive research exists relating to specific communities, a macro view from the country level provides a lens from much larger samplings of the population. The goal was to highlight environmental or situational forces that promote or restrict altruism across countries. Key factors relating to the political, economic and sociocultural elements of each country were evaluated alongside 2012 Global Preference Survey results relating to altruistic tendencies of citizens to begin isolating significant correlations between degrees of democracy, history of democracy, GDP, income inequality, trust attitudes and collectivist values. GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 53 Research Questions (1) To what extent are political factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? (1-1) Is there a significant difference in the level of altruism between countries with and without democracy? (1-2) To what extent are the degree of democracy and the age of democracies associated with the level of altruism? (2) To what extent are economic factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? (2-1) To what extent is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) correlated with the level of altruism? (2-2) To what extent is income inequality correlated with the level of altruism? (3). To what extent are sociocultural factors correlated with the level of altruism across countries? (3-1) To what extent is the level of trust attitudes correlated with the level of altruism across countries? (3-2) To what extent is the level of collectivist values correlated with the level of altruism across countries? Quantitative analyses were conducted to investigate the research questions. For Research Question 1-1, independent sample T-tests were performed to compare altruism scores between countries with and without democracy. In Research Questions 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, and 3-2, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient tests was performed if normality assumption GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 54 was met and the Spearman’s rank-order correlation was utilized when normality assumption was not met. In Research Questions 1-2 normality was met for the degree of democracy, but not the age of democracy which meant degree of democracy could be evaluated using Pearson while age of democracy’s relationship to altruism was evaluated using non-parametric tests (Spearman’s rho and Kendall’s tau_b). In Research Question 2-2, GDP was transformed into log10 and after testing for Skewness and Kurtosis found parametric testing was appropriate where Research Question 2-2 found that income inequality was not equally distributed and required non- parametric testing. Research Questions 3-1 and 3-2 were both tested for normality and fell within the -2 and 2 range permitting Pearson Correlation parametric testing. Discussion of the Findings Though Musick & Wilson’s 2008 study found older democracies showing decreased levels of altruism while former communist countries of Eastern Europe increased in volunteerism, the findings of this study suggest there is no correlation between age of democracy and altruistic rating. Grönlund (2013) highlights the debate on the influence of democracy on volunteerism (Curtis, Baer Grabb, 2001; Halman, 2003) arguing that long-standing democratic regimes will show higher rates of volunteerism due to their long history of formal volunteerism. Ziemeck (2003) on the other hand, argued that countries without democratic governance will experience heightened levels of volunteerism. However, this study also found significant correlation between degree of democracy and whether a country operates as a democratic or authoritarian government. This study found that, countries with less democracy are more likely to show altruism than countries with more democracy. According to the data in this study, there GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 55 is also negative correlation between democratic countries and altruistic rating suggesting authoritarian countries are more likely to show altruism than democratic countries. In opposition to Klavans & Boyack's 2017 findings from their research on economic factors from 2010 - 2013 and their non-correlation to altruism, this study did find a moderately significant correlation between GDP and increased levels of altruism. On the other hand, this study’s finding is consistent with the previous studies (Simms Dphil & Persaud, 2009; Materia et al., 2005). This finding suggests that people living in countries with higher GDP are more likely to show higher levels of trust as well as altruism. However, income inequality, though viewed through a much smaller sample size, did not identify any significant influence. Studies associating trust attitude with altruistic action towards others (Chen et al., 2014; Johnson & Mislin, 2011; Kao & Sek-Hong, 1993) were supported by this study’s findings of country level trust attitudes showing a significant and positive influence on altruism score. In regard to collectivist versus individualistic attitudes, no significant correlation to altruism was identified. Table 16 provides the correlation matrix among all the variables. The reason to include this information is to provide a better understanding of how each independent variable is connected to each other. Table 16 Correlation Matrix 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 1.

With respect to the correlation among the independent variables, the following mechanism is helpful to understand the findings for Research Questions 1-3. Not surprisingly, authoritarian countries show a lower level of democracy than democratic countries, which is linked with the significant findings for Research Question 1 as follows: 1) authoritarian countries are more likely to show altruism than democratic countries, and 2) countries with less democracy are more likely to show altruism than countries with more democracy. Second, authoritarian countries, which yield higher altruism in Research Question 1, are significantly more likely to show collectivism than democratic countries, r = -.326, p < .001. On the other hand, countries with a higher GDP, which yield higher altruism in Research Question 2, are more likely to show individualism than countries with a lower GDP, r = .289, p < .05. The GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 57 degree of democracy is not significantly associated with a nation’s GDP, r = .078, p = .513. Aligned with this finding, no significant relationship exists between a nation’s authoritarian status and GDP. These findings suggest that there is no linear relationship between countries with less democracy or authoritarian countries and a nation’s GDP. Taken together, while countries with less democracy or authoritarian countries tend to be more collectivist, they are not necessarily showing a lower GDP than countries with more democracy or democratic countries which tend to be more individualistic. The non-linear relationship among authoritarian vs. democracy, collectivism vs. individualism, and a nation’s GDP is likely to yield the finding of Research Question 3— no significant correlation between collectivism vs. individualism and altruism. Third, a significant positive correlation emerges between trust attitudes and GDP, r = .340, p < .01 suggesting that people living in countries with a higher GDP are more likely to show a higher level of trust attitudes. The positive linkage between altruism and GDP is likely to contribute the finding of Research Questions 2-3 that show countries with a higher GDP and a higher level of trust attitudes are significantly more likely to show altruism than their counterparts with a lower GDP and a lower level of trust attitudes. Implications for Practice Better understanding potential motivators for pro-social action will allow leaders to identify and activate those drivers in their community. Increasing service learning, corporate social responsibility initiatives and volunteerism throughout a community will present a generational impact on the members of that community as well as those performing the pro- social actions. Going beyond kin-centric ideologies and better understanding altruistic GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 58 personality variations from a cultural perspective provides the tools to attract and award appropriately. These factors can be leveraged to encourage altruistic action at larger scales. As the expansion of research into altruism, kin-centric motivation and altruistic personality continue to develop, isolating the variables that encourage or restrict pro-social action will become more valuable and actionable. From a corporate social responsibility aspect, organizations can identify the type of corporate culture they form and apply internal structures that encourage community volunteerism and leadership development by promoting organizational trust and political structure in global companies. Recognizing that similar initiatives will have varied success based on the country in which they are executed will prepare organizational leadership to vary tactics in advance. Likewise, in service learning initiatives, students are likely to have varied experiences based on the geographical location, political structure and sociocultural factors at play in their communities. Recommendations for Future Research Evaluating data at the country level requires extensive resources, time, access and organization. In line with the findings presented, additional research leveraging country-level, longitudinal studies to identify changes generationally would be tremendously impactful especially in situations where a country has transitioned into and out of a democratic state. Identifying more reliable reporting methodologies than self-reporting would provide a more reliable view of actual altruistic likelihood rather than an individual’s perceived actions. In addition, continuing to analyze altruistic rating by other global datasets segmented by the country-level will allow future researchers to begin to map the areas most likely to be significant when promoting pro-social action. Breaking down individual regional data and GLOBAL ALTRUISTIC VARIATIONS 59 performing ethnographic studies to identify differentiating factors will continue to illuminate the variables that correlate with altruistic ratings. Examining altruism throughout the development of a nation in political or cultural transition would also be an enlightening evaluation as it may present more rapid extraneous variables that put pro-social action and sacrifice to the test. Collecting data pre and post wartime or economic collapse may inform the impact of altruism when faced with extreme external stressors. Conclusions In summation, the findings of this study support the concept that an altruistic personality is influenced by more than kin-centric ends. By examining political, economic and sociocultural variables, a mix of strong, minor and unrelated correlations are brought to light. The political structure citizens live under influences altruism. Those in countries with higher degrees of democracy are less likely to rate highly altruistically than citizens from more authoritarian governments. The number of years a country has operated in a democracy does not present any significant correlation with said altruistic ratings. The data also supports the idea that altruism has a minor correlation with the wealth of a country, but no significant correlation regarding the income inequality of said country. Lastly, where trust is found to be a contributing factor to higher levels of altruistic rating, citizen’s attitudes in relation to individualism or collectivism are not significant.
