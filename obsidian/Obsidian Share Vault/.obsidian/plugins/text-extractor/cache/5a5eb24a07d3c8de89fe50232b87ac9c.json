The party should, too. \u0000e Colorado congressional candidate who nearly defeated Lauren Boebert has a plan for rebuilding a winning Democratic coalition. December 1, 2024 4 min 1650 When a candidate takes on a challenge knowing the odds are against him, the odds usually prevail. But there are also lessons to be had in falling short, and they can point the way for the next people who try. Democrat Adam Frisch knows what it is like to buck expectations. The former Aspen City Council member has been doing it for the past three years in Colorado. In his bid this year for a U.S. House seat, Frisch drove what he estimates were 77,000 miles across 27 counties, much of it in a red Ford F-150 pickup with a 19-foot camper trailer attached. In 2022, he became a national sensation when, to the surprise of pretty much everyone, he fell just 546 votes short of Lauren Boebert (R-MAGA) in a western Colorado district that tilted GOP by what the Cook Political Report estimated to be a comfortable six percentage points. It was the closest House race in the country that year, and the scare was enough to persuade Boebert to pack up her carpetbag and move to a district in the eastern plains, where it is practically impossible for even the wackiest Republican to lose. As for Frisch, he tried again to win the seat from which he had chased Boebert — this time, against attorney and political newcomer Jeff Hurd, a more conventional Republican who embraced his reputation for being “as exciting as a bread sandwich.” Despite having raised nearly seven times as much as Hurd, Frisch lost by five percentage points. But he ran well ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the district, which includes glitzy blue Aspen and Telluride, but also vast stretches of conservative rural territory. The post-mortems for the Democrats’ defeat on Nov. 5 are already well chewed over: President Joe Biden was too old and unpopular to have tried to run again, and Harris didn’t have time to establish her own identity as the standard-bearer; the party underestimated public anger over high prices, street crime and the chaos at the border; abortion rights weren’t the motivating issue Democrats expected them to be; there was a backlash to “woke” progressivism. Frisch thinks all of those explanations played a part. But to him, the story of this election can be told in the people he met. Farmers and ranchers. Small towns in southern Colorado with predominantly Latino populations — some newly arrived and some who have been there for nine generations. One person who stands out in his memory, he told me, was an electrician in northwestern Colorado, the hub of the state’s natural gas industry. The man, who was in his mid-60s, was working at a hotel, making about $18 an hour — a drastic cut from the $62 an hour he had been earning in the gas fields, where employment has been declining in part because of government-driven efforts to transition to clean energy. But it was not just the financial hit that bothered him, Frisch said. He also resented what he felt was liberal animosity toward the very nature of his work in the fossil fuel industry. Of voters like him, “I get asked all the time … ‘Why did they keep on voting against their interests?’ And what I think people mean is ‘Why do non-college-educated, working-class people, why did they vote for people that don’t have their economic back?’” Frisch said. “And I’m like, ‘As important as pocketbook issues are, pride and dignity will trump pocketbook issues all day long.’” One set of statistics that Frisch often cites is the decline of Democratic performance in rural counties. As recently as 1996, incumbent President Bill Clinton won about 1,100 of them, a little over half the total. By 2008, Barack Obama picked up only 455. And by 2020, Biden won fewer than 200. It’s a fair guess that the number for 2024 will be even lower. “If the Democrats want to have the House, with a 225-member floor, not a ceiling, they need to have a larger coalition than 20 big cities, Aspen and Martha’s Vineyard,” Frisch said. That is even truer when it comes to controlling the Senate, where rural states have a stronger hold. As for Frisch, he hasn’t ruled out the possibility of running for elected office again. But in the meantime, he is on what he described as a “respectful rant” that his party needs to take a hard look at itself. “I’ve lost twice. I need to own that. But I’ve learned a lot of stuff,” he told me. “And now I’m watching what happened in the recent elections, and I think the best way to get a better country is making sure the Democratic Party gets revamped in some way.” Let’s hope the party is smart enough to listen.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
