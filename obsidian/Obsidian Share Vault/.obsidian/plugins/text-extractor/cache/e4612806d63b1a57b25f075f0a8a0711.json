It also provides data about electoral volatility for both the class bloc and the demarcation bloc. This dataset will be regularly updated so as to include the next rounds of the European Parliament elections. Content Country: country where the EP election is held (in alphabetical order) Election_year: year in which the election is held Election_date: exact date of the election RegV: electoral volatility caused by vote switching between parties that enter or exit from the party system. A party is considered as entering the party system where it receives at least 1% of the national share in election at time t+1 (while it received less than 1% in election at time t). Conversely, a party is considered as exiting the part system where it receives less than 1% in election at time t+1 (while it received at least 1% in election at time t). AltV: electoral volatility caused by vote switching between existing parties, namely parties receiving at least 1% of the national share in both elections under scrutiny. OthV: electoral volatility caused by vote switching between parties falling below 1% of the national share in both the elections at time t and t+1. It is important to clarify that this category is not computed by aggregating the scores of each party falling below 1% and then comparing the overall sum at time t and t+1, unless in the few cases where disaggregated data of the ‘Others’ category were unavailable (see notes on individual countries on this point). Conversely, each party’s volatility is counted separately and then added to the calculation of OthV. This choice has been made to avoid underestimation of Total Volatility 2 but at the same time to maintain a distinction between parties above 1% and parties below 1% for the calculation of the two components of RegV and AltV. TV: total electoral volatility in the party system, given by the sum of the previous measures. RegV + AltV + OthV = TV. Class_BlocV: net change in the aggregate vote share for all parties included in the Class Bloc Dem_BlocV: net change in the aggregate vote share for all parties included in the Demarcation Bloc Sources The sources for the electoral results in the EP elections have been the official data provided by the pertinent electoral authority in each country. For certain elections for which national electoral authorities do not provide disaggregated information for minor parties we have supplemented them with other non- official online sources. Details about sources and other methodological choices are specified below in the notes on the individual countries. The availability of complete electoral data including all parties contesting the EP elections has allowed for an accurate calculation of Total Volatility and its internal components. Methodological criteria The index of electoral volatility has been originally developed by Pedersen (1979). Given the emphasis on the internal components of the index of electoral volatility, the most important question has been that of understanding when a party can be considered as ‘new’ and included in the calculation of RegV. On this point, also for the sake of consistency with volatility data in the general elections, we have followed the same choices by Emanuele (2015) in the ‘Dataset of Electoral Volatility and its internal components in Western Europe (1945-2015)’. Therefore, we have relied on the classic criteria set by Bartolini and Mair (1990 [2007] 283–284) regarding mergers and splits of existing parties: when two or more parties merge to form a new party, or when two or more parties merge with an existing party, electoral volatility is computed by subtracting the vote share of the new party from the combined vote share of the merging parties in the election immediately preceding the merger. When a party splits into two or more parties, electoral volatility is computed by subtracting the combined vote share of the new parties from that of the original party in the election immediately preceding the split. Following again Bartolini and Mair’s choices, we have considered as splits all those separations that derive from official decisions of a minority within the structure of a given party. As a consequence, splits and mergers have been included in the calculation of AltV. On the contrary, when a party leader or deputy is expelled or simply exits from a party and then launches a new party, this latter has been included in the calculation of RegV. Moreover, ‘genuinely new parties’ – namely ‘parties that are not successors to any previous parliamentary parties, 3 have a novel name and structure, and do not have any important figures from past democratic politics among their major members’ (Sikk 2005, 399) – clearly enter the calculation of RegV. These criteria are also used, among others, by Dassonneville (2015), Chiaramonte and Emanuele (2017), Dassonneville and Hooghe (2017), and, also for the study of Central and Eastern European countries, by Lane and Ersson (2007), Ersson (2012) and Emanuele, Chiaramonte and Soare (2018). As underlined by Sikk (2005, 393– 394), this approach is conservative, in the sense that it underestimates voters’ mobility but it ‘seems to better balance shortcomings and merits’ with respect to alternative approaches. Furthermore, according to Ersson (2012, 4), this approach ‘is the least troublesome one’. 1 As regards thresholds, for the calculation of TV and its internal components, whenever data were available, all parties’ scores between elections have been confronted. In the few cases where disaggregated data of the ‘Others’ category were unavailable (see notes on individual countries below) the residual category of ‘Others’ has been confronted across subsequent elections and the resulting volatility has been included in OthV. As in Emanuele (2015), we have set a threshold of 1% of the national share for parties in order to be included in the calculation of either RegV or AltV. The rationale behind this logic is that when a party casts 1% or more, it is already considered as a relevant component of the party system while a vote shift from, say, 1.9% to 2.1% is only considered as an alteration in the strength of an established party, devoid of any regeneration for the party system. We believe that, while any threshold could be considered arbitrary and has its own trade-offs, to not set any threshold would be even more distorting for the purpose of calculating the extent to which a party system is undergoing a regeneration. Therefore, a threshold is necessary to set a qualitative distinction between parties that produce a significant change within the system and parties that simply enter the election game. Finally, once again following previous choices made by Emanuele (2015), Independents for which we do not have separate information have been treated as a unique ‘party’, but always included in OthV, so as to not inflate either RegV or AltV. Bloc volatility Introduced for the first time in the 1980s (Borre 1980; Mair 1983; Bartolini 1986), and later systematically developed and empirically explored by Bartolini and Mair (1990), the concept of ‘bloc’ volatility refers to the net change in the aggregate vote share for all parties included in a given ‘bloc’, based on theoretical considerations. For a long time, the predominance of the left-right conflict as the main dimension of electoral competition (Fuchs and Klingemann 1990) and the spread of the class cleavage in all Western European party systems (Lipset and Rokkan 1967; Rokkan 1970; Bartolini 2000) led the literature to 1 For a further discussion on possible alternative methods for calculating electoral volatility, see Casal Bértoa, Haughton and Deegan-Krause (2017). For a detailed literature review about what has to be considered a ‘new party’, see Emanuele and Chiaramonte (2018). 4 focus on bloc volatility as class bloc volatility. The concept of bloc, therefore, is intrinsically linked, at least in its origin, to the concept of cleavage, and specifically to that of class cleavage. However, from both a theoretical and an empirical viewpoint, the concept and the related measurement can be extended to cover different dimensions of competition that have the potential to create a divide within the electorate and among parties representing the two sides of a given conflict that has received a politicization. Based on the analysis of a large literature, resulting from both classical studies and recent contributions, our choice is to focus on the two main conflicts that are deemed to structure political and electoral competition in Europe today, namely the old class conflict and the rising demarcation conflict (see the following sections below). From an empirical viewpoint, bloc volatility is nothing but an internal component of total volatility that measures the net aggregate vote switching between the two sides of a given bloc. The remaining part of electoral volatility, defined as Within-Bloc Volatility (WBV) is instead devoted to capture all vote shifts occurring within the two blocs and can be simply obtained by subtracting Bloc Volatility (BV) from Total Volatility (TV) (Bartolini and Mair 1990 [2007], 28–31). Hence, by definition, BV can range between 0 and TV but can never exceed TV. To calculate BV is sufficient to measure the net change – in absolute terms – in the aggregate vote share for the parties belonging to a given bloc (say, parties included in the class bloc) between two consecutive elections. This is because all the remaining parties are assumed to be part of the opposing bloc (i.e., the bourgeois bloc in the case of the class bloc). The class bloc For the definition of the class bloc and the identification of parties included in such bloc we rely on Bartolini and Mair (1990) and Bartolini (1983; 2000). We include ‘those parties which are the historical product of the structuring of the working-class movement’ (Bartolini and Mair 1990 [2007], 46). Therefore, following these authors, we consider the historical communist, socialist, social democratic, and labor parties originally emerged to politicize the mobilization of the working class in Europe and represent it in the national political life. These historical parties (and their successors) have been systematically included in the Class Bloc, while parties of the ‘New Politics’ (Poguntke 1987; Kitschelt 1988; Müller-Rommel 1989), emphasizing issues like environmentalism, feminism, or civil rights have been always excluded. For 11 Western European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom), Bartolini and Mair (1990 [2007], 285) and Bartolini (2000, 573–574) provide the full list of parties included in the Class Bloc up to the 1980s. These lists represented a useful starting point for our classification that, being based on the European Parliament elections, covers the period since 1979. Direct successors of class bloc parties included in these lists have generally entered our classification, with the only significant exception of right-wing splits from social democratic or labor parties (see later in this section). For the inclusion of potentially new 5 class bloc parties emerged in recent years in these 11 countries and for all the remaining countries covered by this dataset in the whole period under study (starting from the accession into the European Union), we have carefully considered all parties belonging to the communist, socialist, and social democratic party families in the ParlGov database (Döring and Manow 2019) and in the communist and socialist party families in the Comparative Manifesto Project Database (CMP) (Volkens et al. 2018). Then, by relying on specific literature on these parties and party-related sources, we have excluded those parties that did not fit our substantive (see above) or methodological criteria (see below). As regards our methodological criteria, we have excluded from the calculation of the aggregate vote share of the Class Bloc parties that have never received 1% of the vote share in general elections. This choice was done to exclude extremely minor parties whose potential inclusion in the Class Bloc was hard to assess with a sufficient degree of precision given the scarce information available. Moreover, as concerns party continuity and change across time, class bloc parties changing name or symbol, merging or forming joint lists with other class bloc parties are obviously included in the Class Bloc. Conversely, in the case of splits or in the case of merge between a class bloc party and a non-class bloc party, choices become less straightforward. Generally speaking, we looked at the splinter party and included it in the Class bloc whenever it still maintained a clear communist, socialist, or social democratic programmatic profile (e.g., the case of Communist Refoundation Party in Italy in 1992). Conversely, ‘right-wing’ splits from Social democratic parties (e.g., the Movement of the Radicals of the Left from the Socialist Party in France in 1994) that have explicitly abandoned their former ideological references to social democracy, shifting their programmatic focus away from economic left issues and embracing liberal, radical, green, or ‘new politics’ ideological profiles, have been generally excluded from the Class Bloc. In the case of merge between a class bloc party and a non-class bloc party, the general rule we have followed is to consider the new party as part of the Class Bloc when the class bloc party was the largest predecessor (as in the case of the merge of Democrats of the Left and The Daisy into the Olive Tree List in Italy in 2004 and later into the Democratic Party in 2007). In all cases of non-class bloc splits from a class bloc party or mergers between class bloc and non-class bloc parties, following Bartolini and Mair (1990 [2007], 285– 286), the total vote share of the non-class bloc party is counted in continuity with the original party for Class Bloc Volatility in the first election. This is also a consistent choice with the rules followed for the calculation of TV, so as to avoid the theoretically impossible case of BV exceeding TV. The same methodological rules apply also to the Demarcation Bloc (see the next section). As a result of these selection, a total of 98 class bloc parties have contested the European Parliament elections since 1979 in the 28 EU-member countries (see Table 1). 6 Table 1.

In a series of studies, Kriesi et al. (2006; 2008; 2012) have widely supported the idea of the emergence of a new ‘demarcation’ vs ‘integration’ cleavage, pitting the ‘losers’ and ‘winners’ of globalization against each other. In particular, Kriesi et al. (2008) identify globalization as the driving force of social and political change in the last decades, thus generating new sources of differentiation and inequalities in national communities. ‘Likely winners of globalization include entrepreneurs and qualified 7 employees in sectors open to international competition, as well as all cosmopolitan citizens […on the contrary,] losers of globalization, by contrast, include entrepreneurs and qualified employees in traditionally protected sectors, all unqualified employees, and citizens who strongly identify themselves with their national community’ (Kriesi et al. 2008, 8). As long as citizens are capable to recognize the differences between ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ and articulate their political preferences according to their conditions, political parties respond strategically. New challenger parties emerge and align on one of the two opposite poles, mobilizing voters on this new dimension of political conflict and pushing other (usually mainstream) parties to respond (Kriesi 2008; Hooghe and Marks 2017). Not differently, Hooghe and Marks (2017) in their analysis of cleavage politics, understand globalization as the external shock which is at the base of radical societal changes, leading to the formation of a new transnational cleavage revolving around political opposition against European integration and immigration (Hooghe and Marks 2017, 1). These changes are considered as crucial sources of dynamism within party systems, as challenger parties with distinctive profiles on the new cleavage emerge and respond to political demands coming from voters. In this dynamic process, a new cleavage congeals, restructuring the space of political competition. How is this new cleavage structured? Different scholars have articulated the idea of this new emerging cleavage adopting a vast array of definitions and conceptualizations. Among the others, we record the following: demarcation-integration (Kriesi et al. 2006, 2008, 2012); GAL-TAN (Hooghe et al. 2002); libertarian/universalistic-traditionalist/communitarian (Bornschier 2010); cosmopolitan-communitarian or parochial (Teney et al. 2014; De Vries 2018; Strijbis, Helmer and de Wilde 2018); universalism- particularism (Häusermann and Kriesi 2015). Despite the growing number of definitions used to refer to this new cleavage, there is a general consensus in considering this new line of political conflict as organized along two dimensions: an economic and a cultural dimension (Kriesi et al. 2008, 11). From an economic point of view, the demarcation vs integration cleavage contrasts positions supporting liberal, market-oriented positions with protectionist positions, aiming at defending national markets from international competition. From a cultural perspective, ‘a universalist, multiculturalist or cosmopolitan position is opposing a position in favor of protecting the national culture and citizenship in its civic, political and social sense’ (Kriesi et al. 2008, 11). In other words, on the economic side, pro-state and protectionist stances are opposed to pro-market orientations; on the cultural side, anti-EU and anti- immigration positions collide with pro-EU and multicultural stances (Kriesi et al. 2008). We grounded our definition of the demarcation bloc based on this literature and we classified parties as either belonging to demarcation bloc or not accordingly. To this scope, we rely on two criteria: a quantitative and a qualitative one. Both are detailed in the following. 8 Quantitative criteria In order to identify the political parties belonging to the demarcation bloc, we relied on the data provided by the CMP (Volkens et al. 2018), starting from the first European Parliament election (1979) until the most recent general election in each of the 28 EU member states. WE preferred the CMP to the Euromanifesto Study (Schmitt et al. 2018) for the larger number of observations (party-year dyads) coded (632 against 347). The dataset provides relevant information on the positioning of national political parties in each member state on different dimensions and allows us to identify which of these parties can be considered as part of what we label the demarcation bloc. In the CMP, these data are obtained based on the coding of party manifestos for each national general election. The methodology adopted – and widely validated (Budge and Pennings 2007; Volkens et al. 2009; Pennings 2011) – is based on content-analysis of party manifestos, which are broken down and parsed into quasi-sentences assigned to one of the 56 CMP macro-categories (i.e., issue categories). This procedure allows to measure the proportion of sentences and quasi-sentences that the party has dedicated to a given topic in every single election, thus measuring the party’s relative emphasis on each issue. Also, the dataset distinguishes between positive and negative mentions on the coded issues. For example, on immigration, for each party manifesto in any single election, the CMP reports the proportion of positive mentions (pro-immigration) and the proportion of negative mentions (anti-immigration) on the subject. Coherently with the arguments developed previously, the inclusion of a party in the demarcation bloc is defined on the basis of two dimensions: economic and cultural. The economic dimension is captured by an item that measures the position of the party on free trade and open markets (per407=Support for the concept of free trade and open markets; per406=Favorable mentions of extending or maintaining the protection of internal markets). The cultural dimension is instead gauged by two items that measure each party's pro-anti-EU positions (per108=Favorable mentions of European Community/Union in general; per110=Negative mentions of European Community/Union in general) and pro-anti-multicultural positions (per607=Favorable mentions of cultural diversity and cultural plurality within domestic societies; per608 =Negative mentions of cultural diversity and cultural plurality within domestic societies). For each of the three items, we calculated the party’s position as the difference between the positive and the negative pole for each election. This value has been then weighted for the salience of the issue for each single party, obtained as the sum of the proportion of positive and negative mentions on each item. Free trade and open markets: (per407-per406) * (per407+per406) Multiculturalism: (per607-per608) * (per607+per608) Pro-Anti EU: (per108-per110) * (per108+per110) 9 This calculation yields an index ranging from negative values to positive values, with 0 indicating a neutral party’s position on the issue. The indexes are calculated so that more negative values indicate that the party tends to lean towards the demarcation pole in a stronger way. Once a score has been calculated on these three items for each party in each election, we averaged them separately for the whole period of time taken into account (i.e. 1979-2019). This procedure allowed us to obtain a unique score for each of the three items associated with any single party. Finally, a mean of the means is calculated for the three items to get a synthetic measure of party position and salience on the demarcation-integration cleavage. In order to identify the political parties belonging to demarcation bloc, we adopted a conservative approach. Specifically, a party is deemed to be part of the demarcation bloc if and only if: 1) At least two out of the three items taken into account in this study (i.e. multiculturalism, free trade, Europeanism) have a negative score; 2) The average score of the three items (i.e. the mean of the means of the three items) is negative. The procedure results in a list of 49 parties identified as part of the demarcation bloc. Qualitative assessment The 49 political parties identified as part of the demarcation bloc based on the CMP data have been further analyzed qualitatively. To do so, we relied on secondary sources and, more generally, on relevant scholarly literature. This further step in our construction of the demarcation bloc has served as a robustness check of the quantitative procedure. A thorough analysis of each party included in the demarcation bloc confirmed the robustness and consistency of the data produced by the CMP. However, few exceptions are worth to be noticed. Based on our quantitative analysis of the CMP data, the Social Democratic Party in Denmark, the European Party in Cyprus, and the River in Greece are classified as belonging to the demarcation bloc. However, our qualitative assessment points to a misclassification issue, leading us to exclude these parties from the demarcation bloc. For each of these three parties, we detail the reasons underpinning our choice. The most problematic case is the Danish Social Democratic Party. Traditionally, the Social Democratic Party has been a reformist party, oriented to compromise, and a ‘defender of refugee immigration and (some sort of) multiculturalism’ (Rydgren 2004, 494). However, in recent times, the party has shifted its policy positions (especially on immigration), adopting more restrictive stances on both immigration and multiculturalism (Rydgren 2004; Green Pedersen and Krogstrup 2008; Bale et al. 2009). This change in the party’s positions is largely due to the politicization of immigration especially by radical and mainstream right-wing parties during the 1990s (Bale et al. 2009). To the politicization strategies of these 10 parties, the Social Democratic Party first responded trying to downplay the issue, but as the issue remained salient in the political debate, it started moving towards more restrictive positions and adopting postures which have become less distinguishable to those hold by right-wing political parties (Bale et al. 2009; Bjørklund and Goul Andersen 2002). However, this transformation was highly divisive both among party elites and voters, and in fact resulted in an unclear position (Green Pedersen and Krogstrup 2008, 623), disorientation (Karpantschof 2003: 8, cit. in Rydgren 2004), ‘confusion and frustration – and a weakening position making the party unable, or unwilling, to present strong alternative frames, or counter-frames, of how to deﬁne social problems in contemporary Denmark’ (Rydgren 2004, 497). This fragmentation in the party’s positions led the party to the inability of articulating a credible stance on the issue. This is, at least partially, due to the mainstream nature of the party, which has tried to adapt its policy positions on immigration and multiculturalism when these issues have become increasingly salient for party competition. In doing so, the party has contributed to the depoliticization of socio-economic politics (on which social-democrats had a competitive advantage over their competitors) and the politicization of a socio-cultural dimension of political conflict (on which right-wing parties are more likely to be rewarded) (Rydgren 2004). This strategy was not electorally rewarding and indeed contributed to alienate the traditional social-democratic electorate, a clue that restrictive positions on immigration and multiculturalism were not part of the traditional political discourse of this party. Based on these analyses, we decided to exclude the Social Democrats from the demarcation bloc. The European Party in Cyprus is also a problematic case. Formed in 2005 by New Horizons and dissidents from DISY (Agapiou-Josephides 2011), the party was characterized by a strong nationalist component (Katsourides 2013; Sepos 2008). The nationalist platform was fundamentally anchored to the specific condition of the country and to the conflict with Turkey (which occupied the northern part of the island in 1974) (Katsourides 2013; Faustman 2008). However, the party held a conventional right- wing position (both on economic and socio-cultural issues) and a clear pro-Europeanist posture – convinced that the Cyprus question should be resolved on the basis of a European solution (Agapiou- Josephides 2011; Christophorou 2007; Sepos 2008). Furthermore, the location of the party at European level gives us a further clue on its nature: throughout its life, the party was indeed a member of the European Democratic Party, a moderate European party committed to promote further integration of the EU (Agapiou-Josephides 2011). Based on these insights, the European Party does not match the profile of a demarcation party, thus it has been excluded from the demarcation bloc. Finally, our preliminary analyses included The River in Greece in the demarcation bloc. However, our qualitative analysis led us to exclude this party. The River is in fact unanimously recognized as a centrist (Rori 2016, 1333; Vasilopoulou 2018, 318), reformist (Rori 2016, 1327), and pro-European party (Rori 2016; Tsebelis 2016; Vasilopoulou 2018). 11 The 2019 European Parliament elections and the entrance of new parties in the demarcation bloc New political parties have entered in the computation of the volatility for the demarcation bloc after the European Parliament elections of 2019. These parties have contested the EP elections for the first time in 2019 (or, alternatively, have become politically relevant in these last elections) and their manifestos are not covered by the CMP dataset that we used as our main reference to classify political parties in the demarcation bloc. All the new parties which have run in the last EP elections have undergone a qualitative screening based on scientific literature and secondary sources. This review process led us to include the following parties in the demarcation bloc: Greek Solution (Greece): The Greek Solution was founded in 2016 by Kyriakos Velopoulos, a former member of LAOS. In journalistic reports the party is identified as a radical right-wing party, Eurosceptic, traditionalist, pro-Russian and opposed to the deal on Macedonia2. In the official website of the party3, it is defined as ‘a patriotic and social alliance’ with the aim of strengthening and defending ‘the national interest’. The party has assumed critical positions towards immigration, considered as ‘a risk for the social and economic cohesion of the country’, potentially capable of undermine the stability of the nation. ‘National pride, national identity and national dignity’ are central words in the party's rhetoric. Our Homeland Movement (Hungary): The party was formed by the former vice-president of Jobbik (already included in the demarcation bloc), in open conflict with the party leadership (accused of betraying the ‘national cause’ 4). From what we read on the official website of the party5, Our Homeland has taken a very critical position towards the European Union and its ‘bureaucrats’. The EU is seen as responsible ‘for uniformizing and eliminating the traditional national communities by applying more and more shameless tools masked as legal ones’ and it is deemed to privilege ‘the interests of multinational companies and financial groups’ which facilitate the colonization of the countries of the periphery. In economic terms, the party strongly opposes the interests of multinational companies and widely support ‘the implementation of a self-sustainable economy’, the protection of local products, and the strengthening of local markets. As for immigration, it is considered as a threat for Hungarian culture and security: ‘migration of a population of a different culture is threatening entire Europe and Europe with a mixed population is totally unacceptable.’ The party also expresses harsh positions towards humanitarian visa, considered as a way for illegal immigrants to enter the EU: ‘Any efforts made at borders would be 2 See e.g.: http://www.ekathimerini.com/240887/article/ekathimerini/news/small-euroskeptic-far-right-greek-solution- party-may-squeeze-into-euro-parliament and https://www.ft.com/content/67a17124-8064-11e9-9935-ad75bb96c849 (last accessed 19/06/2019). 3 See: https://elliniki-lisi.gr/# (last accessed 19/06/2019). 4 See: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-far-right-group-national-legion-laszlo-toroczkai- jobbik-a8914021.html (last accessed 19/06/2019). 5 See: https://mihazank.hu/our-homelands-europe/ (last accessed 19/06/2019). 12 futile if we accepted them, since these false immigrants, who deceptively declare themselves as victims of discrimination on grounds of sex, could enter the EU as persons eligible for humanitarian visa. It is not acceptable that legalizing migration is the solution instead of protecting the borders more effectively’. Kukiz’15 (Poland): Kukiz’15 is a political movement founded in 2015. Named after its leader, the former- rock star Paweł Kukiz, the party run in the national elections for the first time in 2015 by adopting a highly critical electoral platform against the Civic Platform (PO)-Polish Peasant Party (PSL) government and advocating for a first-past-the post electoral system (Markowski, 2016, 1316). It is unanimously considered as a far-right party (Markowski, 2016; Fomina and Kucharczyk, 2016; Marcinkiewicz and Stegmaier, 2016), anti-European, xenophobic, populist and strongly anti-elitist (Markowski, 2016; Fomina and Kucharczyk, 2016; Marcinkiewicz and Stegmaier, 2016). Moreover, it fully supports economic nationalism (Markowski, 2016). Although the party’s programmatic platform has not always been consistent over time (Markowski, 2016; Marcinkiewicz and Stegmaier, 2016), the ideological profile of the party can be considered as very similar to that of PiS – already included in the demarcation bloc (Markowski, 2016). Brexit Party (United Kingdom): The Brexit Party was formed at the beginning of 2019 with the goal of accelerating the United Kingdom’s exit process from the European Union. Led by the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, the party focused its electoral campaign for the European Parliament elections on a single issue (Brexit), refusing to publish any party manifesto program before the vote (Smets, 2019). However, the party clearly appears as an anti-establishment, populist, and challenger party (Goodwin, 2019; Stafford, 2019), strongly advocating for independence and self-government. Furthermore, from the ideological and programmatic viewpoints, the Brexit Party is close to the UKIP – already included in the demarcation bloc. Vox (Spain): Contrary to the other parties considered in this section, Vox run in the European elections also in 2014. At that time the party obtained a rather meager electoral performance (1.6%) and was outside the scientific literature’s radar and the CMP database. In recent years, the party has grown considerably, obtaining unexpected electoral performances and public visibility (the party won 6.2% of votes in the EP elections of 2019). Moreover, the party has consolidated its political identity, clarifying its positions on different policy areas (Turnbull-Dugarte, 2019). From this point of view, Vox represents an exceptional case in our analysis: from a situation of electoral irrelevance, the party has now become an important player on the Spanish political scene, as well as a party represented within the European Parliament. Unfortunately, at the time of the release of this Codebook (June 2019), the Vox party manifesto is not covered by the CMP yet, thus we assessed its position based on a qualitative assessment. 13 Vox is generally considered to be a party with a strong right-wing, authoritarian ideological connotation; nationalist, anti-immigration (Turnbull-Dugarte, 2019), and rather critical towards the European Union.6 It is equated with the French National Front and Alternative for Germany – both included in the demarcation bloc in our dataset. All this considered, we decided to include the party in the demarcation bloc. As a result of our qualitative screening, we finally included 51 political parties in the demarcation bloc across the 28 European Union Member States (see Table 2). Table 2. Parties in the demarcation bloc.

In 2009, Hans-Peter Martin’s List disappears (RegV) and the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) is a split from the FPÖ (AltV). In 2014, EU-STOP and NEOS – The New Austria (compared to Young Liberals [JULIS] in 2009) emerges (RegV). Hans-Peter Martin’s and BZÖ disappear (RegV). Moreover, Europe Different (ANDERS) (compared to the Communist Party of Austria [KPÖ] in 2009) emerges (RegV). Furthermore, The Reform Conservatives (REKOS) has been founded by a former BZÖ member who had been expelled from the party: hence, it has been considered as new party (RegV). In 2019, EU-STOP, ANDERS, and REKOS disappear (RegV), while Europe (Peter Pilz List) splits from the Greens (AltV); Belgium In 1979 and 1984 we sum the percentages obtained by the Walloon and the Flemish wings of the Communist Party of Belgium (KPB/CPB) (which, until 1989, contested elections as a unitary party). In 1984, the Flemish Bloc (VB) is considered as a split from People’s Union (VU) (AltV), while the Democratic Front of the Francophones (FDF) is jointly considered with the Walloon Liberal Party- European Liberal Party (PLW-PLE) (AltV), given this latter includes the Walloon Rally (RW) which contested the 1979 European election with the FDF. In 1989, Regebo is a joint list including the Socialist Workers Party-Revolutionary Workers League (SAP-RAL) and the KPB, the Flemish split from the KPB/CPB (which was above 1% in 1984, hence RegV).

Bulgaria 15 In 2009, the Central Electoral Commission of Bulgaria reports 8 votes less than the sum of the votes gained by each party as the total valid votes for the election. We relied on the absolute votes got by each party (http://izboriep.bta.bg/). In 2009, the Blue Coalition (SK) is considered as a merge among Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB), United Agrarians (former ZNS), Bulgarian Social Democratic Party (BSDP – running in 2007 with DSB) and Radical Democratic Party in Bulgaria (AltV); moreover, the Liberal Initiative for Democratic European Development (LiDER) and the Bulgarian National Movement (IMRO) emerge (RegV) (Spirova 2010, Kolarova and Spirova 2010).

However, these votes have been excluded from the total of valid votes. The coalition Democratic Bulgaria is formed by Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria and the Movement Yes Bulgaria, including candidates from the Greens (AltV). The Alternative for Bulgarian Revival leads the Coalition for Bulgaria that falls below the 1% threshold (RegV); the same occurs for the party People’s Voice (RegV). The party Volya and the coalition The Way to the Young (NDSV and New Times) emerge as new parties (RegV). Cyprus In 2009, the European Party (EVROKO) is considered as the successor of For Europe (GTE) and New Horizons (NO) (AltV).

Furthermore, Democratic Front (DiPa) splits from DIKO (AltV). In addition, in 2019, Green Party (KOP) split from Movement for Social Democracy (EDEK) and merges into SP (AltV). Croatia In 2013, the list ‘Voters' group – Ivan Jakovčić’ is treated as a party and not as an individual candidate, since Jakovčić is leader of the Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS), which is an antecedent of the Kukuriku 16 coalition running in 2014. In 2019, the coalitional arrangement between parties changed significantly from 2014, so that new coalitions formed including parties that were in different coalitions in 2014. To assess volatility, the following party groupings were considered. 2014: HDZ coalition (HDZ + HSS + HSP AS + BUZ) + Kukuriku coalition (SDP + HNS–LD + IDS + HSU + SDSS) + Alliance for Croatia (HDSSB + HSP + Hrast + HZ–A + HSS) + Croatian Labourists–Labour Party (CL–LP). 2019: HDZ + SDP + Croatian Sovereignists (Hrast + HKS + HSP AS + UHD) + Amsterdam Coalition (HSS + GLAS + IDS + HSU + PGS + D + CL–LP) + Independents for Croatia & Croatian Party of Rights (NHR + HSP) + Croatian People's Party & Liberal Democrats (HNS + LD).

The party TOP09, running on a ticket with STAN, emerges as a split within Christian and Democratic Union-People’s Party (KDU-CSL). At the same time, ANeO and KAN – running with STAN in 2009 – presented their own lists in 2014. Thu, in 2014 STAN and KDU-CSL are compared with the ticket TOP09-STAN, KDU-CSL, ANeO, and KAN.

Martin Helme in 2004 and in 2009 ran as an independent candidate. However, from 2008 to 2011 he was leader of the Estonian Patriotic Movement (ERL), founded in 2006, which since 2012 merged with the party People's Union (RL) to form the Conservative People's Party (EKRE).
