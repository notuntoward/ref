In this report, we analyzehow wind power forecastingcanserve asanefﬁcienttool towardthis end. We discuss the current status of wind power forecastingin U.S. electricity markets and develop several methodologies andmodeling tools for the use of wind power forecastingin operationaldecisions, from the perspectives of the system operatoraswell asthe wind power producer. In particular,we focus on the use of probabilisticforecastsin operational decisions. The mainﬁndingsfrom eachof the chaptersaresummarizedbelow. Statisticalalgorithms basedon computationallearning are typicallyused to convert weather forecastsandobservationaldatato wind power point forecasts.In Chapter2, we test different trainingcriteriafor aneuralnetwork appliedto wind power point forecasting.We arguethatthe bestchoice of trainingcriterion depends on the forecastuser andthe intended applicationof the forecast. In a case study with datafrom the Iberianelectricity market, we illustrate the conﬂicting objectives between wind power producers and system operators, and how this conﬂictmayinﬂuencethe choice of trainingcriteriafor wind power forecasting.In the Iberian market,there is anassymmetryin the imbalanceprices, andthis gives the wind power producers anincentive to basetheir marketbidson abiasedforecast.However, such astrategywould give rise to largerdeviationsbetweenscheduled anddelivered energy, which is not in the interest of the system operator.By testing the traditionalminimum squareerror criterion againstseveral entropy-basedcriteriafrom informationtheoretic learning,we ﬁndthatthe maximumparametric correntropy criterion in this casegives results thatareacompromise betweenthe objectivesof the system operatorandwind power producer. We conclude thatit is importantfor system operatorsto havetheir own unbiasedforecastfor reliabilitypurposes. We analyzethe current statusof wind power forecastingin U.S. electricity marketsin Chapter3. Most independent system operators (ISOs)/regional transmission operators (RTOs) in the United Stateshaverelativelylimited experience with wind power forecasting.Still, wind power forecasting is alreadyused for several important applicationswith a focus on maintaining reliability.As the wind power capacityis rapidlyincreasing,we ﬁndthatthere is aneed to better integrate wind power forecasting into different parts of electricity market operations. Wind power forecasting can play an important role in the determination of operating reserve requirements, day-aheadscheduling andmarketclearing,reliabilitycommitments, andreal-time dispatch.At the sametime, from aregulatoryperspective it is alsoimportantto design electricity markets that give market participantsthe opportunity and right incentives to provide their unbiasedforecastinformationthrough their scheduling andbiddingdecision. ISO/RTOs and marketparticipantswill need to develop new tools andprocedures to makeefﬁcientuse of the forecast infonnation with the overall goal to make better operationaldecisions under the increased uncertainty and variabilityfrom wind power and other sources of renewable generation.A key challengeis therefore to improve decision makingunder uncertaintyandthe understandingof the impactof uncertaintyon operationaldecisions. At the sametime, it is importantto continue the improvements of Wind power forecastingmodels andto bettertune xiii them to the speciﬁcneeds of the forecastusers. From the perspective of system/marketoperators, it is particularlyimportantto improve predictions of forecastuncertaintyandrampingevents. We investigatethe representationof wind power forecastinguncertaintyin the unit commitment problemin Chapter4. Traditionaldeterministic unit commitment models use apoint forecastfor wind power output. In contrast, we propose a stochastic alternativethat captures forecast uncertaintybyusing scenariosthatcapturecross-temporaldependencies in the predicted wind power. We conduct acomparisonof adiversity of unit commitment strategieson atest power system with ten thermal units and 20% wind power penetration. The results indicate that representing wind power forecastinguncertaintywith wind power scenarios combinedwith stochastic unit commitment has advantagesover the traditionaldeterministic approaches. Moreover, the stochastic model provides arationaland adaptiveway to provide adequate spinning reserves atevery hour, asopposed to increasingreserves to predeﬁned,ﬁxedmargins thatcannotaccountfor the system’scosts or assumedrisks. However, the results alsoindicate thatthe scenariosdo not capturethe full rangeof wind power forecastuncertainty,andthatit is prudent to impose acertainlevel of additionalreserves alsowith stochasticunit commitment. A set of scenariosis aconvenient wayto represent wind power uncertaintyin decision problems with inter-temporal constraints. However, an extremely large set of elementary scenarios is needed to obtainanaccuraterepresentationof the probabilitydensity function covering the complete forecastingspace.The size of this set is usuallyincompatiblewith complex algorithms such asthe stochasticunit commitment problem,which is time demandingandrequires high computationaleffort. In Chapter5, we propose amethodology thatcansubstitutealargescenario set byasmallerset of clusters. Eachcluster is replacedbyarepresentativescenarioassociated with the probabilityof the scenarios it represents. The reduction capabilitydepends on the admittedtolerance, the distancemetric used to deﬁnethe clusters, andthe dispersion of the originalscenarios.The choice of the metric andthe admissibletoleranceshould bedeﬁnedin accordancewith the decision problem, andthe level of accuracyneeded for the results. The method not only produces aset of focalor representativescenarios,butalsoorders them by probabilityvalue. This approachallows retaining a selected number of scenarios and understandingthe risk of missing an adequaterepresentation due to truncatingthe original scenarioset. Furthermore, the necessarynumberof scenariosto satisfyamaximumlevel of risk canbechosen. This work, therefore, is acontributionto facilitatingthe adoptionof stochastic optimizationmodels in operationalplanning,for instance,to use asinput to the stochasticunit commitment algorithmssuch asthe one presented in Chapter4. In Chapter 6, we investigate in more detail the potential use of probabilisticwind power forecastingin the commitment of energy andoperatingreserves. Such forecastscanprovide scenarios as input to astochastic unit commitment or, alternatively,canbeused to derive dynamic operating reserve requirements for use in detemiinistic unit commitment. One advantageof dynamicoperatingreserves is thatthis approachis betteralignedwith current operatingprocedures. Furthermore, the deterministic unit commitment model hasamuch lower computationalburden.However, dynamicreserves do not capturethe effect of inter-temporal ramping events. Moreover, this approachdoes not consider uncertainty and its cost in the objective function. In contrast, stochastic unit commitment does address inter-temporal variabilitythrough the scenario representation of uncertainty. Furthermore, the total cost, including the expected cost of scarcity,is explicitly takeninto accountin the objectivefunction. However, the switch to stochastic unit commitment involves amore radicaldeparture from xiv current practice,it mayrun into computationalconstraintsin largesystems, andthe beneﬁtsin terms of cost savingsmaybelimited. In fact,our numericalresults from the 10-unit test case, andalsofrom amore realisticcasestudy of the power system in Illinois, show thatdynamic operatingreserves and stochasticunit commitment give similarresults in terms of cost and reliabilityalthoughthere maybe distinct differences in commitment and dispatch decisions. Furthermore, we ﬁndthatscenarioreduction algorithms,such asthe one presented in Chapter5, tend to lower the variancein the reduced scenarioset. In turn, this result reduces the amountof hedging builtinto the stochasticunit commitment solutions giving rise to aneed for additional reserves. Finally, when comparing the use of different probabilisticforecasts, we ﬁndthat forecastsbasedon kernel density estimationtend to give betteroperationalresults thanforecasts from quantileregression, possiblydue to betterforecastcalibration. Future work is likely to improve the qualityof probabilisticwind power forecasts,bothin terms of the estimation of probabilitydistributions and in the generation of adequatescenarios. However, there will alwaysbeinaccuracyin probabilisticforecasts,just as in point forecasts. This fact calls into question the overall risk paradigmunder which the system operator’s scheduling decisions are made. In stochastic unit commitment, where the objective is to minimize the expected cost, one canadjustthe risk level bychangingthe costs of unserved energy andreserves. However, other approachesbasedon different decision paradigms— such as utility theory, value atrisk, robustoptimization, or regret — should alsobe considered. Ultimately,the optimaldecision strategydoes not only depend on the risk preferences of the system operator,butalsoon the qualityof the probabilisticforecast. Finally,in Chapter7 we investigatethe potentialuse of probabilisticforecastingfor wind power producers. We describe amodel for optimaltradingof wind power in day-aheadelectricity markets under uncertainty in wind power and prices. The model considers settlement mechanismsin marketswith locationalmarginalprices, where wind power is not necessarily penalizedfrom deviationsbetweenday-aheadschedule andreal-timedispatch. We use utility theory andconditionalvalueatrisk to represent the risk preferences of the wind power producer. The model is tested on datafrom ahypotheticalwind farmlocatedin the state of Illinois combinedwith historical price data.The results demonstrate thatprobabilisticwind power forecastscanplayanimportantrole in guiding wind power tradingdecisions in the day-ahead market.The results alsoindicatethatprice forecastsareimportantin order to derive good trading strategies,particularlyunder marketdesigns without penaltiesfor deviationsbetweenday-ahead schedule andreal-time delivery. Furthermore, risk preferences clearlyinﬂuencethe optimal tradingdecisions, with risk averseowners biddingless energy into the day-aheadmarketto reduce their exposure to high real-timeprices. The decisions arealsohighly dependent on market design, andthe results show thatadeviationpenaltydrives the optimalday-aheadbidcloser to the point forecastfor allstrategies.This is in the interest of the system operator,becauseit makes the taskof balancingsupply and demand in the system an easier one. However, deviation penaltiesalsoaddasigniﬁcantﬁnancialburdenon wind power producers andtherefore reduce the proﬁtabilityof wind energy. Revising marketrules to give efﬁcientoperationalincentives without addinganundue burdenon wind power andother renewableswill clearlybeachallenge aswe move forward. Overall,we conclude thatstochasticmodels will beimportanttools to control the trade-offbetweenrisk andreturn for wind power producers participatingin electricity markets.Improved scheduling decisions andbetterrisk managementwill increasethe viabilityof XV wind power in the long run, andour analysisshows thatwind power forecastingcanserve asan importanttool to achievethis goal. xvi 1 INTRODUCTION Driven byincreasingprices for fossil fuels andconcerns aboutgreenhouse gas(GHG) emissions, wind power, as arenewableandcleansource of energy, is rapidlybeingintroduced into the existing electricity supply portfolio in manypartsof the world. The U.S. Departmentof Energy (DOE) hasanalyzedascenarioin which wind power meets 20% of the U.S. electricity demand by 2030, which means that the U.S. wind power capacitywould have to reach more than 300 gigawatts(GW) [1]. The EuropeanUnion is pursuing atargetof 20/20/20, which aimsto reduce greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions by20%, increasethe amountof renewableenergy to 20% of the energy supply, andimprove energy efﬁciencyby20% by2020 ascomparedto 1990 [2]. Meanwhile,Chinais the leadingcountry in terms of installedwind capacity,andhad45 GW of installedwind power capacityout of about200 GW on agloballevel atthe end of 2010 [3]. The rapid increase in the penetration of wind power into power systems introduces more variabilityanduncertaintyin the electricity generationportfolio, andthese factorsarethe key challengeswhen it comes to integratingwind power into the electric power grid. Wind power forecasting(WPF) is animportanttool to help efﬁcientlyaddressthis challenge,andsigniﬁcant efforts havebeeninvested in developing more accuratewind power forecasts.In this report, we document our work on the use of wind power forecastingin operationaldecisions. 1.1 Wind Power Forecasting A WPF system, asillustratedin Fig. 1-1, uses input datafrom different sources, including results from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, local meteorological measurements, supervisory control anddataacquisition(SCADA) datadescribingthe real-time(RT) stateof the wind power plants,andadditionalinformationaboutthe characteristicsof the wind power plants andthe nearbyterrainandtopography.WPF models aretypicallybasedon acombinationof physical and statisticalmodels. The physical approachdescribes the physical relationship betweenatmosphericconditions, localtopography,wind speed, andthe output from the wind power plant.In contrast,the statisticalapproachestimatesastatisticalrelationshipbetweenall the relevantinput dataandthe resulting wind power generationwithout considering the physics of the system. The performanceof wind power forecastsandthe forecastaccuracydepends on the availabilityof good NWP forecasts,the complexity of the terrain,andthe availabilityof RT weatherandwind power plantdata.Hence, there canbelargedifferences in forecastingerrors betweenwind power plantsatdifferent locations.WPF systems typicallyproduce forecastsfor a time horizon up to 2—3 daysaheadin time. In general,the forecastingerror increaseswith the forecasthorizon. There are two common forms of delivering the wind power forecast: point forecast and uncertaintyforecast.Through the course of this project, we havedeveloped andtested improved statisticalalgorithms for bothtypes of forecasts, as brieﬂyoutlined below. We provide an extensive overview of the state-of-the-artin WPF in [4]. A complete documentationof our work on improved statisticalWPF algorithmsis availablein [5].

The point forecastestimationis typicallybasedon statisticaltrainingcriteria(e.g. byminimizing the squareerror [MSE]). We haveanalyzedthe impactsof adoptingdifferent statisticaltrainingcriteriafor point forecastingmodels, focusing on the comparisonof different forecastingerror metrics. Our study, documented in [5], showed a signiﬁcantdegree of dependence on the training criterion applied, also pointing out the importance of online training. Speciﬁcally,the applicationof informationtheoretic learning (ITL) trainingcriteriain wind power point forecasting,using neuralnetworks, wastested for two wind farmslocatedin the U.S. Midwest. The advantageof using such metrics over the MSE criterion wasconﬁrmedin these experiments. However, apoint/deterministic forecastcannot provide informationaboutthe dispersion of observationsaroundapredicted value.Moreover, an expectationcannothelp decision makersin calculatingrisks or the conditionalvaluesatrisk. Therefore, it is essentialto generate,together with (or asanalternativeto) point forecasts,a representationof the wind power uncertaintybyadescription of the probabilitydensity function (pdf)- 1.1.2 Wind Power UncertaintyForecasting Uncertaintyforecastsestimatethe marginaldistributionsfor eachtime step, for example,in the form of intervals, quantiles, or scenarios, which represent informationaboutthe uncertainty. Such forecasts can help forecast users in their decision-making processes (e.g., enabling derivationof advancedstrategiesfor marketparticipation).Wind power uncertaintycomprises three key features: model chain, uncertainty representation, and time-adaptivemodels. A traditionalmodel chain consists of using the forecast errors of point forecasts from a deterministic WPF model asinput to the uncertaintyestimation. The wind power uncertainty representationis determined bythe end-user’srequests andthe natureof the decision-making problem.It cantakethe form of probabilisticforecasts,risk indices, or scenariosfor short-term wind power generation(Table1-1). In general,one canonly talkaboutmore or less adequate uncertaintyrepresentations,ratherthanbetteror worse ones. However, the pdf representationis the most complete andﬂexible,enablingarangeof different decision-makingproblemsin the power system domain.By using atime-adaptivemodel, the forecastingsystem is ableto cope with non-stationarydataand,therefore, to adaptto the new situationwithout requiring additional ofﬂinetrainingof the model. 2 Uncertainty Representation Table1-1 Different types of uncertaintyrepresentationin WPF. Quantiles IntervalForecasts ProbabilityMassFunction ProbabilityDensity Function , , Meteo Risk Index Risk lndlces Prediction Risk Index Scenarioswith TemporalDependency ScenariosOf Generation Scenarioswith Spatial/Temporal Dependency Probabilistic Our uncertaintyforecastingstudies, documented in [5], tested two new kemel density forecast (KDF) methods appliedto the wind power uncertaintyproblemin bothofﬂineandtime-adaptive modes: the Nadaraya-Watson(NW) estimatorand quantile-copula(QC) estimator. Both the EasternWind IntegrationandTransmissionStudy datasets,aswell astwo Midwest wind farms, were used in different casestudies andwere comparedto linearandsplines quantileregression (QR) methods, which is the current stateof the art. The results show thatthe KDF andQR methods havesimilarperformancein terms of sharpness,resolution, andskill score, althoughthe fonner leadto abettercalibration.In addition,we found thattime-adaptiveapproachesfor both NW andQC changethe biasof the probabilisticforecasts(i.e., calibration),while only slightly changingthe sharpness andresolution. Moreover, the time-adaptivemode improves the skill score when comparedto the ofﬂineapproach. An alternativewayof presenting the wind power uncertainty is byusing adiscrete set of scenarios,sampledaccordingto aprobabilitydensity function associatedwith the forecasts,and therefore ableto characterizethe uncertainty according to the historical error distribution. Another advantageof ascenarioset is thatit caninclude the temporaldependency informationof the errors. However, in order to capturethe entire characteristicof the wind power forecasted during the prediction period accurately,adecision makermayneed to evaluateahigh numberof scenarios. This is a time-consuming and computationallydemanding task and the computationalburdenusuallyis not compatiblewith stochasticprogrammingalgorithmsrun in useful time. Therefore, there is typicallyaneed to select only asmallnumberof scenariosthat canrepresent the whole scenarioset atbest.We explore scenarioreduction algorithmsandtheir applicationin the power system domainin more detailin this report. 1.2 Wind Power Forecastingin OperationalDecisions Different agentsin the electricity marketmayhaveconﬂictinginterests asthey interactin the marketenvironment. Wind power producers typicallyaimatminimizing their forecastingerror over alonger period of time, in order to betterschedule their generation.However, their main concern is in maximizingincome. System operators, on the other hand, areconcerned with guaranteeingthe security of the system. System operators are interested in minimizing operationalcosts while maintainingahigh level of reliability.This implies thatthe choice of a WPF model is not neutraland,in some cases,the deﬁnitionof whatconstitutes agood wind power forecastmight differ betweenforecastusers. For along time, a“good”forecasthasbeen considered to ﬁtpredictions closest to the observedvalues,in whatis known asthe forecaster’s 3 paradigm.This ideahas given placeto the forecast consumer’sparadigm,which states that forecastsshould betuned towardthe user’sinterests. With this (new) relativeconcept, we can assess the forecast either in tenns of consistency (correspondence between forecasters’ judgment), quality(correspondence betweenforecastsandobservations),or value(incremental beneﬁtsdue to implementationinto decision-makingprocess). We focus on system operatorsand wind power producers astwo distinct anddifferent WPF users in this report. 1.2.1 System Operators From the perspective of asystem operator,its concern in guaranteeingthe security of the system is closely relatedto WPF uncertainty.In fact,largeunexpected changesin wind power output over ashort period of time is one of the majorissues in power system operationswith wind power. In the presence of such rampingevents, system operatorshaveto develop operational procedures in order to satisfythe loadandmaximizeboththe economicalandenvironmental beneﬁts.The longer the time aheadof such events thatthey canbepredicted, the more options a system operatorhasto balancethe system. However, forecastuncertaintygenerallyincreases with the forecasthorizon. A key challengefor the system operatoris therefore to handlethe uncertaintyandvariabilityfrom wind power in acost-efﬁcientmannerwithout compromising system reliability.System operatorswill need to adoptnew methods to betterhandlewind power andother renewableresources in their scheduling anddispatchdecisions. In this study, we tackle this problemfrom two ways.One wayis to extend the traditionaloperatingreserve strategies, thatis, to schedule appropriateamountsof reserve capacitybasedon informationfrom wind power uncertaintyforecasting.Another wayis to rethink the formulationsof the power system scheduling and market clearing problems. We explore a stochastic formulation of the unit commitment (UC) problemandanalyzeto whatextent stochasticprogrammingapproachescan dealwith the wind power uncertainty. 1.2.2 Wind Power Producers From the perspective of awind power producer, it is becomingincreasinglyimportantto manage the risk of participatingin the electricity market. A majority of the wind power in the United Statesis sold under long-tenn power purchasingagreements(PPAs), which lock in the price of delivered electricity andtherebystabilizethe revenue stream. However, asigniﬁcant shareof wind power is beingsold directly to the electricity market.It is obviouslyimportantfor merchantwind generationto applyscheduling andtradingstrategiesthatreﬂectthe uncertainty in wind power andprices andthe corresponding trade-offbetweenrisk andreturn. Buyers of PPAs alsohaveto schedule the contractedwind power into the electricity marketandmust consider how wind power inﬂuencesthe scheduling strategy of the rest of their portfolio. Tradingof wind power in electricity marketsis still arelativelynew problem.In this report, we investigatethe scheduling andtradingof wind power focusing on electricity markets in the United Stateswith locationalmarginalprices (LMPs), including settlement procedures andtheir inﬂuenceon tradingdecisions. Moreover, we develop anoptimizationmodel for wind power tradingunder uncertainty.The model canﬁndthe optimalwind power bidunder uncertaintyin forecastsfor wind power andprices (day-aheadandreal-time,considering the risk preferences of the wind power producer andthe impactof potentialdeviationpenalties. 4 1.3 Report Outline This report documents our researchon the applicationof wind power forecastingfor bothsystem operatorsandwind power producers. The report is organizedasfollows: Chapter2 reports a study of WPF trainingcriteria andthe “goodness”of aforecast, focusing on the electricity market in Spain and Portugal; in Chapter 3, we discuss the current use of WPF in U.S. independent system operator (ISO)/regional transmission operator (RTO) markets; Chapter4 presents our implementationof WPF uncertaintyin astochasticformulationof the UC problem, as well as acomparison among different UC strategies; Chapter 5 presents anew clustering-basedscenarioreduction method for generationof adequateWPF scenariosfor use in stochastic programming models; in Chapter 5, we present a comparison between different probabilisticforecastingandscenarioreduction methods andtest the resulting forecastson the stochasticUC model from Chapter4; Chapter7 describesanew model for optimaltradingof wind power in day-aheadelectricity markets under uncertainty in wind power and prices, considering settlement mechanisms in the electricity markets with LMPs; ﬁnally,Chapter 8 summarizesthe overallconclusions from our work on the use of WPF in operationaldecisions. Note thatfor manyof the chapters,the content hasbeenpublishedin conference proceedings or journalpapers.References to underlying publicationsareprovided in footnotes atthe beginning of eachchapter. 5 This pageintentionallyblank 6 2 GOOD OR BAD WIND POWER FORECASTING: A RELATIVE CONCEPT1 This chapterreports astudy on the importanceof the trainingcriteriafor WPF andcallsinto question the generallyassumedneutralityof the “goodness”of particularforecasts.The study, focused on the Spanish electricity market as a representative example, combines different trainingcriteriaanddifferent users of the forecaststo comparethem in terms of the beneﬁts obtained.In additionto more classicalcriteria,anInformationTheoretic Learning(ITL) training criterion, calledparametriccorrentropy, is introduced asameansto correct problemsdetected in other criteriaandto achievemore satisfactorycompromises amongconﬂictingcriteria,namely forecastingvalueandquality.We show thatthe interests of wind farmowners mayleadto a preference for biasedforecasts, which may be in conﬂictwith the larger needs of secure operatingpolicies. The ideas andconclusions are supported byresults from three realwind farms. 2.1 Introduction The demand for more accurate,short-term WPF models has led to solid and impressive development in recent years[4] [6]. Increasingthe valueof wind generationbyimproving WPF systems’performance— andfurthering its integrationinto operationalmanagement is one of the priorities in current research[7]. On manypastoccasions,energy marketparticipantshave takenfor grantedthata“good”forecastwould besomething thatturns out to beasclose to the actualvaluesaspossible.This view is calledthe forecasterparadigm,where the concern is to ﬁt the prediction to the observedvaluesin the signalprocessing sense. A good exampleof aWPF evaluationprotocol in agreementwith this paradigmis [8]: the mainconcern is minimizing the forecastingerror, andno importance is given to the nature andconsequences of the errors. However, it maybearguedthatthe deﬁnitionof the goodness of aforecastshould bestrongly relatedto the use given to such aforecast.In the forecastingpilot project bythe AlbertaElectric System Operator [9], an important ideais that aforecast should be oriented bythe user’s interests. Forecastingerrors maybeseen through manyperspectives (e.g., mean,bias,maximum deviation,phaseerror, etc.), andthe natureof the errors maybetoo broad one particular forecastis not likely to beconsidered optimalsimultaneouslyin distinct applications,such as marketparticipationor power system operation. This situation has been recognized in the domainof weather forecast. Several publications discuss what agood or badforecast is. Murphy [10] distinguished three different types of goodness in forecasts: (1) the correspondence between forecasts and forecasters’judgments (consistency); (2) correspondence between forecasts and observations(quality); and (3) the incrementalbeneﬁts(economic/or other) when employed byusers asaninput into their decision- makingprocesses (value).The factorof consistency in WPF is not discussed in this chapter:it is assumedto beincluded bythe forecasterin the model during the development phase.In order to assess the quality of WPF, the standardapproachis basedon statisticalerror measures (e.g., meanabsoluteerror) [8]. However, this approachdoes not guaranteethatthe forecastwith the best score is the one with best quality. An alternativeapproach,called veriﬁcation framework,waspresented byMurphy and Winkler [11]. This approachis basedon the joint distributionof forecastsandobservationsandfactorizationof this distributioninto conditional 1 This chapteris reproduced from Wind Energy, Vol. 14, No. 5, R.J. Bessa,V. Miranda,A. Botterud, J. Wang, “‘Good’or ‘Bad’Wind Power Forecasts:A RelativeConcept,”pp. 625-636, 2011, with permission from Wiley. 7 andmarginaldistributions.Pinson [12] used this framework,namedthe “distribution-oriented approach,”andappliedit to WPF. His objectivewasto study the maincharacteristicsof WPF uncertainty. The third type of forecastgoodness, forecastvalue,is often very difﬁcultto quantify,asin some casesit is relatedto non-economic factors.However, some decision makersmaygive ahigh relevanceto these criteria[13]. Some researchershavereported incrementaleconomic beneﬁt from the use of WPF in the participationof wind power in electricity markets.Usaolaet al.[14] quantiﬁedthe economic advantagesof using anadvancedforecastingapproachthattakes as input numerical weather predictions (NWPs) instead of persistence. Barthelmie et al. [15] estimatedthe wind farmsize for which WPF outweighs the cost of installingor implementing short-term forecasts.The authorsconclude thatthe economic beneﬁtof using WPF depends on the accuracyandcost of purchasingthe forecast.Angarita-Marquezaet al. [16] estimatedthe income obtainedbyawind farmin the Spanish andBritish marketsbyusing anadvanced forecastingsystem (Sipreolico) comparedto persistence. In the British market,the Sipreolico system produced results similarto persistence becausethe period betweengate closure and actualdelivery wasvery short. For the Spanishmarket,becausethe period betweengateclosure and delivery was longer, Sipreolico improved the income amount(s) when compared to persistence. Pinson et al. [17] studied the use of WPF probabilisticforecaststo support the participationof wind generationin the electricity market.The authorsshowed thatwith the informationabout uncertainty, it is possible to derive advancedstrategies for marketparticipationleadingto a signiﬁcantincreasein income when comparedto persistence andpoint forecastsobtainedwith fuzzy-neuralnetworks. Fabbriet al. [18] proposed aprobabilisticmethodology for estimating the WPF error costs in the electricity market.Other relatedworks canbefound in [19]—[21]. One crucialaspectis thatthe relationshipbetweenqualityandvalueis nonlinearanddiffers from problemto problem,aswell asfrom user to user [22]. Hence, it is importantto recognize that there aredifferent users for WPF, the two most importantbeingwind generationcompanies (WGENCOs) thatbidtheir wind generationinto the electricity marketandsystem operators (SOs) thatmust guaranteethe security of the system. The output of aforecastingprocess or model cantherefore be evaluatedaccordingto two paradigms,which we will calltheforecasterparadigmandtheforecastconsumer paradigm.The former is mainlyconcerned with the time series in itself, in the signalprocessing sense, andis therefore relatedwith quality;the latterfocuses on the use given to the forecastsandis therefore relatedto value. The mainideadriving this chapteris to promote the recognition (manytimes forgotten) that distinct user groups mayhaveconﬂictinginterests in arestructured marketenvironment, and therefore the choice of amodel is not neutral.For instance,SOs areinterested in minimizing operationalcosts while maintainingahigh level of reliability.In contrast,WGENCOs aremainly interested in maximizingtheir income levels in the electricity market.Hence, in some conditions, the deﬁnitionof a“good”forecastvarieswith different forecastusers. 8 This chaptercontributesto the discussion of this topic bycomparingthe forecasterrors and economic consequences of adoptingseveralcriteriafor the statisticaltrainingof WPF models. To illustratethe relevanceof the concepts discussed, the chapterpresents acasestudy of the Iberianday-ahead(DA) electricity market(MIBEL). The study could bereproduced for other markets;however, the objectivehere is not to study andcomparemarketsbutto discuss models, andthe examplepresented is sufﬁcientlyrepresentative.Our mainobjectiveis not to provide an alternativeto the approachesbasedon probabilisticforecasts[17] [21] butratherto highlight a new view of the relativeimportanceof the forecasterror in amulti-criteriaandmulti-perspective paradigm,in which biasedpoint forecastscould beproduced to increasethe marketincome, and to stress the conﬂictingobjectivesthatmayexist betweendifferent users (or stakeholders).To compensate for some of the problems identiﬁed and analyzed,we introduce parametric correntropy, which is anew trainingcriterion for WPF thataims to arrive at asatisfactory compromise betweenforecastvalueandquality. We ﬁrstdiscuss the WGENCOs’andSOs’perspectives on WPF. Next, on the basisof actualDA market datafrom MIBEL, we illustrate the conﬂictbetween the viewpoints and also the applicationsof different trainingcriteria.Finally,we analyzethe consequences of the different trainingcriteriafor the two WPF users. 2.2 The “ForecastConsumer Paradigm” 2.2.1 Wind GenerationCompanies’Viewpoint In arestructured marketenvironment, forecasterrors mayhaveanassociatedcost or penalty,as the wind power producer usuallyends up supplying anamountof energy thatdiffers from the marketbid.The marketremunerationscheme adoptedin this chapteris for operatingin the DA marketandis analogousto the one formulatedin [17]—[2l]. In this mechanism,wind power producers offer energy quantitybids(Eb)atdayD (typicallytill 12:00 noon) for every hour of dayD+l in the DA market, andthey arepaidatthe market clearingprice (ps). Then, if the actualwind generationis aboveor belowtheir bid,they will be subjectto apenaltyasfollows: - If the actualgeneration(Ep) is abovethe marketbid,the excess is paidatadiscounted surplusprice (p ). This price canalsobenegative,which represents acost. - If the actualgenerationremainsbelowthe marketbid,apenaltyis appliedaccordingto the price (pshmage)of the generationthatthe SO hasto purchaseto compensatefor the insufﬁcientgeneration. Eachmarketspeciﬁesits own rules for the calculationof deviationcosts, andtherefore, no generalconclusion canbeoffered. However, it seems obvious andthis chapterconﬁrmsthis ﬁnding thatif the penaltiesareasymmetric,then anopportunity arisesfor agamblerto beneﬁt from using abiasedmodel insteadof aneutralmodel. A wind farm’sincome (I) from selling for agiven look-aheadtime t+k canbeformulatedas: 9 1; 1 1; b I _ {Kati/if‘EekT PIS-ll/tpus ‘(ErikTEi+k)> Erik > Eta-k (2 1) 1+/< T 1; h ‘t b 1; ' pf+k 'Ei+1< T P21?) age‘(EurT Ez€k)E1ik < E!+k This formulationcanberearrangedbyconsidering the balancingprices, cd0W,,j,,g=p,-p,.u,p;,,, and cup_reg = pshortagfpsi as: s _ p _ down_reg_ p _ b )7 p h I _ pr+k Et+k cr+k (Et+k Et+k Er+k >Ez+k 2 2 1+/F _ s p up_reg < b p l p b ( _ ) {pldrk 'Er+k _cr+k ' Er+k _Er+k Er+k < Er+k It is importantto emphasize that in this market formulation, the WGENCOs are appointed balanceresponsibility;hence, they haveaﬁnancialresponsibilityfor anyimbalance. In some markets,if the deviationhelps the SO balancingmeasure,then the marketagentis not penalized.Note thatthe intra-daymarketsarenot takeninto accountbutmayreduce the forecast error — andconsequently the deviations— considerably. From the WGENCO viewpoint, the value of the WPF in the market is translatedby the additionalincome provided by such forecasts over the income obtainedwith an altemative method. The ﬁrstcomponent of (2-1) is constantandcorresponds to the income obtainedwith perfect forecasts.Hence, maximizingthe marketincome is analogousto minimizing the expected costs of balancing(second component in [(2-2)]). Therefore, in order to meet its goal, the WGENCO will follow aparticularbiddingstrategydepending on the marketbalancingcosts. Becauseof the uncertaintyin prices andwind generation,resolving this matteris adecision problemunder uncertainty.Severaldecision rules canbeused for ﬁndingthe preferred bid.The decision rule used most often is to ﬁndthe bidE,+;,”thatminimizes the expected balancingcosts (i.e., to maximizeexpected income). This rule wasﬁrstintroduced byBremnes [23] andhasbeen used byauthorsin [17] and[21]. This decision rule describesarisk-neutralattitude(i.e., alinear utility function). Bourry et al. [20] presented analternativestrategybasedon portfolio theory that balancesbetween the expected value and the risk of the balancingcosts distribution. Botterud et al.[24] present amethodology to derive optimalDA bidsfor awind power producer under uncertaintyandcomparethe results of different biddingstrategies(e.g., maximizingthe utility). The authorsdiscussed how the optimalbidsdepend on the electricity marketdesign. Under the marketassumptionsoutlined above,the “optimal”bidof the expected valuedecision rule possesses ananalyticalsolution; for aproof see [23]. The bidthatmaximizesthe expected income is the cdown ,,,g(cd0W, reg +cup Mg)1 quantileof the forecastedprobabilitydistributionof wind generation.It is found thatthe “optimal”biddepends only on the quantileproportion computed from the balancingprices. For instance,if Cd0wn_f@g> cup_,¢g, the “optimal”quantileis above0.5 (median),andthis result constitutes overestimation;conversely, if cd0W,U@g< Cupifeg’the “optimal” quantileis belowthe medianandthe result is underestimation. Basedon this ideaandascarriedout byPinson et al. [17], the forecastwith higher economic valueis not necessarilythe one with lower forecasterror (in accordancewith the “forecaster’s paradigm”).The results presented bythe authorssupport this idea:apoint forecastwith 40.55% I0 of imbalances(with respect to produced energy) achievedanincome of 1.15 M€ over one year, whereas anadvancedstrategybasedon aprobabilisticforecastreachedahigher 55.46% of imbalances— butalsoanincome of 1.21 M€. As mentioned before,if the deviationis in favorof the system, then the WGENCO does not pay balancingcosts under some markets’rules. In [21], the biddingstrategyproposed byBremnes [23] wasextended to include this possibility,assumingthatthe system balanceis unrelatedto the wind power imbalanceor thatallwind power producers follow the samebiddingstrategy. Finding the decision rule andthe bestbiddingstrategyis clearlyacomplex problemthatrequires wind power andprice forecastinginformation.One alternativeis to develop economic-oriented training criterion for training wind-to-power (W2P) models. Ravn [25] analyzedatraining criterion thatpenalizesaccordingto the balancingcosts andthe sign of the forecasterrors: Inln dzwdou/n_)'eg l R+k _Pt+k + Wup_r:eg ‘B+k _B+k J mm u The expression is divided into terms of overestimation,J”p(ll, >1}, ), andunderestimation, Jd°W”(13),, <P,+k); wd0,,.,,_,eg andWup_yeg arepenalizationfactorsrelatedto the marketbalancing costs. By applyingthis trainingcriterion, aneconomic biasis introduced, which canincreasethe forecasterror, butalsoincreasesthe income from the market.Therefore, the economic valueof a wind power forecastcanbeincreasedbyinformationprovided byeither probabilisticforecastsor economic-oriented deterministic (point) forecasts. 2.2.2 System Operator’sViewpoint In our discussion, the viewpoint of the power SO is not linked to how the SO should makethe forecasts.In Botterud et al.[26], the current use of WPF in U.S. ISO/RTO marketsis discussed, and recommendations for how to make efﬁcientuse of the information in state-of-the-art forecastsareoffered. In this section, the discussion is relatedinsteadto the impacton the operationalpolicy from the economic-oriented marketbidsprovided bythe WGENCOs. As statedin the previous section, a WPF system thatprovides the maximizationof income to aWGENCO should not betrusted or used bySOs. The SO needs to managethe combinationof generationandconsumption variabilityconsidering unit outages.Therefore, in arestructured electricity marketenvironment, the SO acquiresallof the reserve needed for the control area,in order to maintainaminimum reliabilitylevel. In the dailymarket,the SO atdayD is in chargeof deﬁningandcontractingthe operating reserve (i.e., the reserve relatedto loss of loador generationsurplus attributableto forecasterrors — bothin loadandwind — andunit outages(e.g., spinning andnon-spinning reserve) needed for the next day (dayD+]) [27]. These operating reserve levels are generally settled by deterministic criteria,such asthe capacityof the largestunit plus anempiricalformula,such as the Union for the Coordinationof Transmissionof Electricity (UCTE, now ENTSO-E) rule [28]. 1] However, in the literature,probabilisticapproachesareproposed byseveralauthors; see, for example,[29] and[30]. The integration of large shares of wind generation requires an increase in the amount of operatingreserve thatis needed to balancegenerationandloadin order to maintainanacceptable level of reliability.Results from [29] and[31] support this idea.Despite reducing wind power variabilityasaresult of the aggregationof severalwind farms,the variabilityanduncertaintyof wind generationtend to beasource of stress for the operationspersonnel. Becausethe loadandgenerationaredispatchedbythe marketmechanism,andassumingthat WGENCOs participatewith bidsin the market,the strategicbiddingfollowed byWGENCOs may inﬂuence signiﬁcantlythe needs for operating reserves and also the overall cost of balancingthe system. As mentioned in the previous section, aWGENCO’sincome does not necessarilyincreasebyreducing forecastdeviations. Therefore, the forecasterror should be considered to beof secondaryconcern for the SO, becausethe relevanterror in this caseis introduced bythe marketbids. For instance,if the marketbidsoverestimatethe wind generation,then the loadwill bemet by “untrue”generationin the DA market.In this case,the SO with its own neutralWPF system can forecastthe wind generationuncertaintyandbyusing, for instance,anapproachthatis similarto thatused in [30] to detect ahigh risk of not meeting the load.Hence, the SO will need to commit more generatingunits (e.g., using the reliabilityassessmentcommitment to commit more units [26]) or to contractmore upwardreserve, which increasesthe operationalcosts. The need for upwardreserves is the most criticalsituation,even for planningthe power system capacity,asit requires thattraditionalpower stationcapacitiesmust beavailableasoperating reserves. This situationmaylimit the abilityof wind power plantsto replacethe conventional power stationcapacities. Of course, this system balancingcost depends on the generationmix (e.g., the reserve provided bygasturbinesor hydro is less expensive) andon the operatingstrategy[32]. For instance,in caseswhere the SO deﬁnesthe reserve requirements on the basisof deterministic criteria,the awarenessof this overestimationmayleadto ahighly conservativeattitudeandanadoptionof high safetymarginsto minimize the risk — andwill therefore heavilyincreasethe operational costs. In addition,asmentioned in [33], imbalancesmayaggravatepotentiallylargeout-of-merit automaticgenerationcontrol (AGC) costs. All of these operationalcosts will bepartof the tariff paidbyallcustomers. Nevertheless, the SO mayhaveto shed loadif it hasofﬂineunits becauseof the expected wind power availability(asbidinto the market).It mayalsohappenthatthe deviationbetweenload andgenerationcannotbemet byallof the availableoperatingreserve becauseof transmission constraints. The samebehavioris validfor the casewhere the wind power bidsareunderestimated.This problemis of less concern for the SO, becauseit does not need to shed loador haveadditional power stationsavailableto cover the energy deﬁcit.However, the SO alsoneeds to contract 12 downward reserve (e.g., reserve to deal with generation surplus due to forecast errors, e.g., pumped storage)andmayhaveto curtailwind generation.This situationleadsto whatis calledan“over-commitment”of conventionalgeneration,which will reduce the economic and environmentalwelfareof the power system. At this point, the key question from anSO viewpoint is: whatis a“good”forecast(or bid)for the marketmadebyWGENCOs? The “UCTENetWork of Experts on Wind Power,”composed of experts from severalSOs such asTranspower(Germany)andREE (Spain),statedin [34] thatthe crucialissue is the expected maximumforecastdeviation,andnot the meanforecasterror. The group’sﬁndingis becausethe extreme deviationsmayleadto loadshedding. Consequently, for anSO, agood criterion will beto minimize the expected maximumforecasterror. However, this trainingcriterion maybedifﬁcultto translateto afunction, so the minimum meansquareerror (MSE) could beanacceptablecriterion becauseit weights the largedeviationsmore heavily. However, this criterion must beviewed from the perspective of maintainingadesired reliability standardbasedon energy offered in the market by the market participants,including WGENCOs. In this case,a“good”WGENCO forecastfor anSO should bethe one thatleadsto: (1) less use of reserves, in particularupwardreserves; (2) alower expected maximumforecast error; and(3) deviationsin favorof the system. The ﬁrsttwo criteriamayleadto aconﬂictwith the WGENCO’sviewpoint. With respect to the third item, it is importantto point out thatif allWGENCOs use abiddingstrategybasedon the system deviation,it is probablethattheir deviationswill beagainstthe system deviation.Even in asituationwhere forecasterrors help the system deviation,the SO must (in the daybefore) contract reserve and schedule the generation according to a probabilisticalgorithm or deterministic rule without knowing this informationapriori. 2.2.3 The Compromise Viewpoint, or the Searchfor Utopia The forecasting and market bidding analysismust be performed carefully, becausewe are dealingwith two generallyconﬂictingviewpoints, asoutlined above.In this case,there is no direct applicationof the trade-offconcept, becausethere is no single agentthatevaluatesits gainsin one criterion for giving up some valuein anothercriterion — with disjoint or partially disjoint sets of criteria,aloss in one criterion is felt byanagentbyjust aloss. This analysis pertainsto the ﬁeldof multiple agentdecision making,where it is recognized thatthe “Utopia” solution (i.e., one thatoptimizes allcriteriafor allagents,even those with conﬂictinginterests and who may not even share the same criteria) is generally an infeasiblepoint. Utopia corresponds to the highest level of aspirationfor allagents.In contrast,the “ideal”solution refers to the maximumaspirationof asingle agentandis therefore anindividualisticconcept. Marketparticipantstherefore seek solutions thatmaybeseen asanacceptablecompromise by the several agents. These problems are solved either bynegotiationor byarbitration(if one excludes the use of force); in the former case,the mode is unsupervised, andin the latter,it is a supervised mode. The relations between Utopia and the negotiation solutions have been extensively studied: the Nash bargainingsolution (a Pareto-set solution that is the most equitable),the Kalai-Smorodinskysolution (providing more weighting to the “needier”player), andthe Gupta-Livensolution (aPareto-setsolution in the line connecting the reference or focal point solution with Utopia)arejust examples[35][36]. 13 In our study, this function is not carriedout through anegotiationprocess butbyadoptingthe concept of a “compromiseviewpoint”through the external assumption of what a “good” compromise should look like this concept resemblesthe arbitrationprocess, where anexternal independent agentwith supervisory powers (e.g., aregulator)maydecide on the characteristics of compromises among agents byconsidering criteria(or utility functions) pertainingto all agentsin ajoint framework. It is naturalto measure the forecast value relative to the income obtainedby the market participant.However, the “optimal”forecastfor aWGENCO maynot bedesired bythe SO, becausethis agentconsiders, in its own evaluationof solutions, distinct criteriafrom those that the WGENCOs consider, namely,costs thatarenot included in the deviationcosts of (2-2): for instance,cost of energy not supplied, contractedreserve capacity,andenvironmentalcosts. The aimin our approachis to offer aWPF trainingcriterion function thatsuggests anacceptable compromise between the two viewpoints. In the following section, several training criteria describedin the literaturearepresented. It must beadded,however, thatanalternativeexists: the decoupling of the problem— thatis, when the distinct agentswork with separateforecastsanddo not takeinto account,for their own decisions, the forecastsused bythe other parties. In thatsituation,eachagentcanadaptthe models andtrainingprocesses to accommodateits own interests without entering into direct conﬂictwith the others. 2.3 TrainingW2P Models 2.3.1 Aspects of TrainingW2P Models A W2P model is aterm used to designateaneuralnetwork, afuzzy inference system, or, in general, any system that emulates an input-output transfer function andwhose performance depends on the tuning of internal weights or parameters,which are used to translatewind characteristics(e.g., wind speed, direction) into electric power. We can identify three basic modules in aW2P: its internalstructure, the trainingcriterion, andthe optimizationalgorithm. Three types of actionscanbeappliedin order to constrainthe trainingof aW2P model (see Fig. 2-1) in: 0 The internalstructure, bymodifying the numberof weights; 0 The trainingcriterion, byselecting anadequatemeasureof performancerelatedwith the forecasterror betweenthe WP2 output (y) andtargetvalue(T) (e.g., meansquareerror); 0 The optimization algorithm, by choosing a mechanism or procedure (e.g., gradient descent) to close afeedbackloop thatupdatesthe weights asafunction of the training criterion computed for atrainingdataset. This chapteraddressesthe aspectof trainingcriterion. 14 lT (target) x (input Y I°\"lP\"ll QIX-W) Optimizing algorithm Fig. 2-1 Basicarrangementof aW2P identifying its three mainmodules. Training Criterion 2.3.2 TrainingCriteria The traditionalMSE andthe meanabsoluteerror (MAE) aretrainingcriteriawith generalized adoption under the “forecaster’sparadigm.”Information theoretic learning (ITL) concepts especiallychallengethe unquestioned adoptionof MSE, becausethis criterion is equivalentto minimizing the varianceof the error distribution,andMSE is only anoptimalcriterion if this distributionis Gaussian— which is not true in most cases,especiallynot in WPF models. Bessaet al.[37] ﬁrstintroduced the ideaof exploring ITL criteria[3 8] to use in trainingneural networks for WPF (W2P model), where two training criteriafrom the ITL paradigmwere considered. The ﬁrsttrainingcriterion is the Minimum Error Entropy (MEE) [39]. The basicidea is asfollows: if the error distributionof the output would becomeaDiracfunction (meaningthat allerrors would beequal),we would havereachedapredictor whose output would reproduce exactlythe actualdataseries — byjust addingto the results abiascorresponding to the meanof the probabilitydensity function (pdﬁof the errors (i.e., the deviationfrom zero). But it so happensthatthe Diracfunction has minimum entropy. Renyi’sEntropy is combinedwith a ParzenWindows estimationof the error pdf to form the basisof MEE under which neural networks aretrained. The second training criterion was derived from an ITL measure named correntropy [40]. Correntropy is ageneralizedsimilaritymeasurebetweentwo arbitraryscalarrandomvariables, X andY, deﬁnedby: V.-(X,Y)=EI/~z.-(X—Y)l <2-4) where kg is the kernel function (usuallyGaussian). Correntropy is directly relatedto the probabilityof how similartwo randomvariablesarealong the line y=x in aneighborhoodof the joint spacedeﬁnedbythe kernel bandwidthU, andit provides the probabilitydensity of the event p§(=Y). The bandwidthcontrols the observation window in which the similarityis assessedbutmakesit impossibleto assesssimilarityin the whole joint space.This limitationis actuallygood, becauseit leadsto the rejection of outliers whose considerationcontaminatesmodels. The trainingcriterion consists of maximizingthe 15 correntropy between the output y and the target T and was called Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC). These two ITL criteriawere only studied in the context of the “forecaster’s paradigm,”andno attentionwasgiven to the valueof the forecast. Viewing the WPF problemfrom the “forecastuser’sparadigm,”for aWGENCO, the training criterion should betranslatedinto economic value,which is relatedwith proﬁtin the marketand penalizationof forecasterrors. Hence, the cost function presented in (2-3) could in theory leadto abetter“forecast”under this paradigm.An alternativethatwe propose is to use the parametric correntropy [41], which hasbeenused so farin signalprocessing problems.The ideais similar to thatof correntropy; however, the comparisonbetweenX andY is performed alongthe line, aX+b=y,where aandbareparameters. The trainingcriteriathatwe use to trainthe W2P model (e.g., neuralnetworks) in the WPF problemaresummarizedasfollows: 1. MSE — Minimum SquareError. This valueis the classicalcriterion thatminimizes the varianceof the error distributionandhasthe form: MSE(e)<:> min — l — (2-5) 2>- L[\\42[\\)>—~ JPN where e = —y,-)is the error of samplei relativeto the targetvalueT,~, andN the number of trainingsamples. 2. MCC — MaximumCorrentropy Criterion. This criterion is basedon acorrentropy and maybeexpressed as: 1 N MCC(e) <3 maxF Z k, (@,) (2-6) i=1 Where kg is the GaussianKernel with bandwidtho. 3. M/1E Minimum AbsoluteError. This criterion minimizes the absoluteerror without takinginto accountthe sign of the error: ll/L4E(e) <:> min |el (2-7) i=1 4. MPC — Minimum PenaltyCosts. This criterion minimizes the error penalties,asshown in (2-3). 5. MPCC Maximum ParametricCorrentropy Criterion. This criterion is basedon parametriccorrentropy andmaybeexpressed as: I6 N MPCC(e, a)<:> maxkg (a~ y, —Ti) (2-8) i=1 where ais aparameterthatis deﬁnedbythe forecasteror computed from the market balancingcosts, andbis set to zero becausethe biasof the forecastcanbeintroduced only with parametera,without increasingthe numberof parametersof the problem. 2.4 CaseStudies 2.4.1 DataCharacteristics Three realwind farmswith different ratedpower (rangingfrom 20 MW to 50 MW) andsituated in different types of terrainareused ascasestudies. Datacollected in the wind farmsinclude supervisory control and dataacquisition registers with an average“package”containing 10 minutes of power delivered bythe wind farmsto the grid. We alsohaveavailableforecasts produced for the sameperiod byamesoscaleweathermodel for meanwind speed andwind direction for areference point in the wind farm,with forecastinghorizons rangingfrom 0 to 48 hours in 1-hour intervals. These datacannotbediscussed in further detailfor reasonsof conﬁdentiality. To organizethe tests, the availabledatawere divided into three sets. The ﬁrstset, with several months’worth of data,wasused asatrainingset. The second set, with one month’sworth of data,wasused asavalidationset. And the third set, with the remainingmonths, wasused asa testing set for comparativepurposes. Table2-1 presents the months used for training,testing, and validationof the neuralnetwork. Table2-1 Training,validation,andtesting sets. Wind Farm A Validation Jan(2007) Testing Jan—Dec (2008) Training Feb—Dec (2007) B Mar—Dec (2007) Feb—Aug C (2007) Feb(2007) Jan(2007) Apr—Dec (2008) Sep—Dec (2007) Datafrom the Iberianelectricity marketwasused in this study. The dataconsists of hourly spot and balancingprices from two years, 2007 and 2008, and was collected from e-sios (the informationsystem of the system operatorof Red Eléctricade Espana,http://www.esios.ree.es). A very complete statisticalanalysisof the price dataused in this study canbefound in [42] (see Chapter5). Moreover, the authoranalyzedthe correlationbetweenthe marketprices (spot and balancing)andthe wind generationfor the samedataused in this chapter.The authorconcluded thatwind power is still havingonly alimited impacton the spot prices in the Iberianmarket; however, it hasalreadymadeanimpacton the balancingprices. Table2-2 shows the annual meanenergy prices in 2007 and2008 for the Spanishmarket(in €/MWh). I7 Table2-2 Annualmeanmarketprices. 2007 2008 Spot Price 39.34 64.47 Up Balancing 2.97 4.04 Down Balancing 7.99 8.02 The balancingprices arevery asymmetric,where the down balancingis more expensive. Also evident is aconsiderablechangein prices from one yearto the next, butthis variationdoes not affectthe results of our study — whatis relevantis the asymmetryin balancingprices. 2.4.2 TrainingCharacteristics We havetrainedafeed-forvvardmultilayerperceptron (MLP) neuralnetwork with only one hidden layerconsisting of 7 neurons byusing ahyperbolictangentactivationfunction. The inputs of the MLP areNWP forecastedvalues:meanwind speed valuesandmeanwind direction values. Because of the cyclic characterof the wind direction, this variablecomprised two components (i.e., the sine andcosine components). This meansatotalof three input variables, which were standardizedbyusing the min-maxmethod, were used. Because the purpose is to compareresults, we do not describe detailsof the traininghere; however, the trainingdetailscanbefound in [37]. Moreover, determining the besttopology of the neuralnetwork is beyondthe scope of this work. The penalizationfactors of the training criterion MPC (2-3) consist in averagevalues of balancingprices for eachlook-aheadtime step (in this case,there are24 time steps) computed from year2007 data.Hence, the diurnalcycle of the prices is included in the model. Regarding the parameteraof the MPCC criterion, the adoptedmethodology is: 1. In the beginningof eachtrainingepoch, the parameterais estimatedfrom the training datasetbyusing the averagevalueof balancingprices of one yearfor eachlook-ahead time step as penalizationfactors of underestimation (wd0W,,_,,,g) and overestimation (Wupiyeg). The trainingcriterion is: max (2-9){kg-Ila-r.- — Wd......_,.,,), y. < T.- ” ka'<(a'yiT ) Wup_reg)>yi >71 where a’is the kernel bandwidthanddepends on the size of the penalizationfactors. 2. After estimatingthe parametera,the following trainingcriterion is maximized: my kc‘la’-rt—T.-I (2-10) Where or is akernel bandwidthmuch smallerthano ’,anda’is equalto 1/a. 18 The kernel size o used byMCC is the samesize used in [37]. The kernel size o in MPCC was found in the validationset to beequalto 0.1, and0\"’wasequalto 3. As expected, the kernel size does not varywidely from one wind farmto another.Yet, o’presents amajorimportancein this problem,becausesmallvaluesindicatesmallsensitiveness to asymmetriccosts. Whatis desired is avalue that gives importanceto the asymmetric costs butthat also maintainsabalance betweenover- andunderestimation.The samevaluesareused for the three wind farmssince whatis desired in WPF is to trainaneuralnetwork for anywind farmwithout concern about tuning parameters. 2.4.3 Testing Methodology The neuralnetwork wasused to predict the power p,+k|, produced bythe wind farmattime stamp 7:00 GMT (when new NWP predictions becomeavailable)for eachlook-aheadt+k of the next day.The wind power prediction wasperformed for eachdayof the test dataset.We havetaken eachwind farmandsimulatedits participationin the electricity marketin the year2008, offering the power prediction generatedbyprediction systems trainedwith different trainingcriteriaand using the hourly spot andbalancingprices from 2008. 2.4.4 Analysisof the Results In this section, we present results for trainingof neuralnetworks in three realwind farmsandone electricity market, when training under the different criteria. Table2-3 through Table2-5 summarizethe results obtainedfrom the participationof wind farmsA, B, andC in the Spanish marketwith bidsequalto the forecastsprovided byeachtrainingcriterion. Q95% is the quantile 95% of the overestimationerrors distribution,which meansthatthe probabilityof havingan upwarddeviationlargeror equalto this valueis 5%; the conditionaltailexpectation(CTE) of this quantilecanbeinterpreted asthe expected maximumforecastdeviation.

Wind GenerationCompanies’Viewpoint The ﬁrstthree trainingcriteriaarenot economicallyoriented. One maysee thatwind farmA realized alower level of income when using them thanit did with MPC andMPCC. The comparisonof the results from MPC with the ﬁrstthree trainingcriteria(which aretypicalof the forecasterparadigm)illustratesthataforecastof worse quality(i.e., largerdeviations)results nevertheless in higher income for aWGENCO. By comparingMCC with MPCC, it is evident thatacceptingasmallincrement in the error leadsto anincreaseof around7,600 € in revenue. In addition, for wind farmA andover the one-yeartest period, the forecastsgeneratedbythe MPCC led to the highest proﬁts(around4,100 € higher) thandid those forecastsobtainedwith MPC. For wind farmB, the ﬁrstthree trainingcriteriaalsoled to lower income levels. In this case, MPC presents a higher proﬁtpotential than does MPCC (by around 7,500 €). The same conclusions for wind farmB arealsovalidfor wind farmC. The economic-oriented training criterialed to higher levels of income, andonce more the MPC realizedahigher level of income thandid the MPCC. From the results of the three wind farms, it becomesclearthatusing MPCC insteadof any statisticalcriterion enablesincreases to the income without signiﬁcantlyincreasing the deviationsresulting from forecasterrors. System OperatorViewpoint For wind farmA, the forecastsgeneratedwith MCC andMAE produce fewer totaldeviations and deviations againstthe system. MCC and MAE underestimate the wind generation, but despite this underestimation,ahigher income wasachievedwith MCC when comparedwith MSE. The MSE criterion placesaheavypenaltyon largeerrors, andtherefore the CTE for MSE presents the lowest valueof allof the trainingcriteria this result meansthatwind farmA is usuallyperceived as agood property bythe SOs. It is therefore satisfactorythat the new criterion, MPCC, could leadaswell to ahigh level of income without signiﬁcantlyincreasingthe totaldeviationsandthe deviationsagainstthe system. On the other hand,the MPC hasahigher biason the side with lower balancingcosts (e.g., ashortageof generation),which is in opposition to the interests of the SO in terms of security of the system. The MPCC for wind farmA is near the “compromiseviewpoint,”asit allowssome increasein the income without amajorincrease 20 in the totaldeviation.The comparisonof MPC andMPCC in the quantile95% andCTE values alsoshow thatMPCC is betterfor the SO when comparedwith MPC. For wind farmB, the ﬁrstthree trainingcriterialed to lower totaldeviations anddeviations againstthe system. The tendency for this wind farmis to underestimatethe wind generation.For this wind farm,the trainingcriterion with fewer totaldeviationswasMCC, which is surprising becauseMAE wasexpected to achievefewer totaldeviations.Once more, MSE presents the lowest valueof CTE. MPC presents ahigher realizedincome thandoes MPCC; however, MPCC allowed(or enabled)increases in realizedincome while the totalnumberof deviations and deviationsagainstthe system aremaintainedatanacceptablelevel. The samebehavioris veriﬁedfor wind farmC, where, while the MPCC realizedalower income thandid the MPC, the totaldeviationvaluesandCTE arelower. In this case,MPC presented a lower valuefor deviationsagainstthe system. 2.5 Conclusions This chapteraddressesthe WPF problembyrecognizing thatthe valueandqualityof forecasts must beappreciatedin the frameworkthatdecision makingis carriedout bymultiple agentsand thatagreementmaynot bepossibleamongthe agents (WGENCOs or SOs) regardingwhat constitutes a“good”forecast.The issues discussed — the relationbetweenforecasterror and market proﬁt— also occur in situations involving more complex forecasting systems and electricity marketrules. The results in this chapterprovide evidence thatforecastswith higher accuracy(in the forecaster’sparadigmsense) do not necessarilyleadto higher incomes for a WGENCO. As such, aWGENCO maybewilling to reduce the forecasts’accuracyin exchange for anincreasedincome. The maincontributionsof the chapteraresummarizedin the following: 1. A challengeto the assumptionof the mathematicalneutralityof forecastingmodels. 2. A thorough discussion of conﬂictinginterests associatedwith the “goodness”of forecastsfor two types of agentsin anelectricity market. 3. A comparisonof the relativeadvantagesanddrawbacksof severalcriteriareferred to in the literatureandused in trainingWPF models. 4. A new approachproposed to achieveacceptable“compromise”solutions to market participantsin the choice of aforecastingmodel byintroducing the ITL concept of parametriccorrentropy. 5. The veriﬁcationof the theoreticalconcepts in arepresentativeexample,namely,the Iberianmarket,MIBEL. Whatis the signiﬁcanceof the results shown in this chapterfor future forecastingpracticesand marketpolicies? First, these results revealthe importanceof the choice of atrainingcriterion for aforecastingtool. In this sense, it is not necessarilytrue thatit is impossibleto achieveahigh remunerationin the electricity marketandmaintainthe forecasterror within anacceptablelevel. Methods thatproduce acceptablecompromises areavailable.Second, in systems with high wind penetrationlevels, it is importantto look atthe impactof the wind generationmarketbidson the balancingneeds. In fact,the marketrules andthe waythatwind power is remuneratedin the marketshould berevisited andpossiblyredesigned to betterfacilitatethe decisions madebythe 2] SO regardingthe security of the system. This chaptershows thatanasymmetryin balancing prices makespossiblethe opportunity for proﬁtbythose forecaster’sparadigmWGENCOs that makecarefulselection of the characteristicsof the output of the forecastingsystems. Whenever there is anasymmetryin the price structure, whether in balancingprices or spot prices (which is more likely to occur in casesof largepenetrationof wind power, with largerimpactson price volatility),aneutralmodel (in the forecaster’sparadigmsense) maynot bethe model thatleads to maximizingthe proﬁtsof WGENCOs thatbidin the market. This chapter also points toward areasfor wider discussion, namely, toward an analysison possiblereactionsof other agentsin the marketto wind power bids,especiallyif indications appearthatbidsdo not correspond to a“neutral”forecast(in the forecasterparadigmsense), which could leadto speculationagainstadmittedlybiasedwind power forecasts.One possible evolution thatthe results in this chaptersuggest would beto decouple the concepts of forecasting andbidding.In some marketsthese days, SOs demandthatWGENCOs bidthe forecastthey have produced — andthen trust it as avalidforecast. However, WGENCOs may wish to develop abiddingstrategy,andthis impetus leadsto the possibilityof adoptingmodels that, while seeming to bemathematically“neutral,”will havecharacteristicsthatserve their particular marketstrategy— andwill possiblybecontraryto SOs’interests. So, it follows naturallythat WGENCOs maybeallowedto bidin anunrestricted manneron whateverpower valuethey prefer, butthatSOs will alsohavetheir own independent forecastsandwill actaccordingto those andnot solely to the forecastsannouncedbyWGENCOs in order to ensure reliabilityin the power system. 22 3 WIND POWER FORECASTING IN U.S. ELECTRICITY MARKETS2 WPF is becominganimportanttool in electricity marketsasthe amountof wind power rapidly increases.However, the use of WPF in marketoperationsandamongmarketparticipantsis still at an early stage. We discuss the current use of WPF in U.S. ISO/RTO markets, andgive recommendationsfor how to makeefﬁcientuse of the informationin state-of-the-artwind power forecasts. 3.1 Introduction Wind power generationhasincreasedrapidlyin the United Statesover the lastfew years,andat the end of 2010, there wasaninstalledcapacityof more than40,000 MW atanationallevel.3 Wind power is alreadyhavingasigniﬁcantimpacton the operationof electricity marketsand power systems in areaswith the highest penetrationof wind power, such as in the Electric ReliabilityCouncil of Texas(ERCOT) andthe Midwest ISO (MISO). A numberof challenges arisewhen integratingrenewablegenerationinto the power system, from transmissionplanning, resource adequacy,andinterconnection standardsto dealingwith the increaseduncertaintyand variabilityin short-term operations.Manyof these challengesarediscussed in recent reports by the North American Electric ReliabilityCouncil (NERC) [43] and the U.S. Department of Energy [44]. It is generallyagreedthatforecastingwill playanincreasinglyimportantrole in the operationof power systems as the level of wind power increases. WPF models havebeen continuously improving over the lastdecade.A numberof WPF providers haveemerged thatarecompeting to provide the bestforecaststo the electric power industry. There areseveraldifferent users of the wind power forecasts,including generationcompanies,wind power producers, utilities, market analystsandtraders,andpower system andelectricity marketoperators.The desired forecasting capabilitiestypicallyvaryamonguser groups. For instance, system operatorsareparticularly concerned with the abilityto forecastrapidchangesin wind power production, so-calledramping events. Wind power producers, on the other hand,maybemore concemed with minimizing their forecastingerror over alonger time period to betterschedule their resources in the marketplace. Some companiesalreadyhaveconsiderableexperience in the use of WPF, asdocumented in 17114511461 In this chapter,we ﬁrstgive abriefintroduction to WPF models. We then present anoverview of the current use of WPF in U.S. electricity markets,with focus on the ISO/RTO marketsthat currently havethe highest penetrationof wind power. Finally,we discuss the need to revise marketdesign to makebetteruse of the informationprovided byadvancedWPF systems in marketoperations. 3.2 Wind Power ForecastingModels A WPF system, asillustratedin Fig. 1-1, uses input datafrom different sources, including results from numericalweatherprediction (NWP) models, localmeteorologicalmeasurements,SCADA 2 This chapteris reproduced from the Electricity Journal,Vol. 23, No. 3, A.

Modern WPF models areusuallybasedon acombinationof physicalandstatisticalmodels. The physical approachdescribes the physical relationship between atmospheric conditions, local topography,wind speed, andthe output from the wind power plant.In contrast,the statistical approachestimates a statisticalrelationship between all of the relevant input dataand the resulting wind power generationwithout considering the physics of the system. The performance of wind power forecastsandthe forecastaccuracydepends on the availabilityof good NWP forecasts,the complexity of the terrain,andthe availabilityof RT weatherandwind power plant data.Hence, there canbelargedifferences in forecastingerrors betweenwind power plantsat different locations.WPF systems typicallyproduce forecastsfor atime horizon up to 2—3 days aheadin time. In general,the forecastingerror increaseswith the forecasthorizon. WPF models arecontinuously beingimproved with the goalof increasingthe forecastaccuracy. Ongoing researchalsofocuses on producing probabilisticforecasts,becauseinformationabout the uncertaintyin the wind generationcanbeof greatvaluefor system operatorsandmarket participants.As anexample,Fig. 3-1 shows two different types of uncertaintyrepresentationin WPF. Ramp forecasting is anotherimportantareaof research. For adetailedreview of the current stateof the artin WPF, we refer to our state-of-the-artreport [1].

The markets in different regions of the country have seen a considerabledegree of convergence in marketdesign in recent years.ISO/RTO marketsalready haveseveralfeaturesthatareadvantageousfor the integrationof wind power into the electric power system, such asthe following: 1. LargeBalancingAuthority Areasgive the system operatorthe control of generationand demandresources over alargerarea,increasingthe overallﬂexibilityof the system to handlevariationsin wind power generation.At the sametime, the variationin totalwind 24 power generation, and also the WPF error, generally decreases as a function of geographicalsize. EachISO/RTO is operatedasone balancingauthorityarea. 2. Centralizedunit commitment andscheduling of energy andoperatingreserves gives the system operatorcontrol of alargepool of generationandloadresources, which canbe used to effectively accommodateﬂuctuationsin wind power output. Combinedoperation of energy andoperatingreserves marketsalsoensures cost-efﬁcientandmarket-based procurement of energy andoperatingreserves. 3. Frequent dispatchof resources in real time. Most ISO/RTO markets re-dispatchthe system resources every ﬁveminutes, upon which new set-points aresent to generators and eligible demand resources. The frequent system dispatch reduces the need to maintainexpensive regulationreserves to respond to short-term ﬂuctuationsin loadand non-dispatchablegeneration. 4. Locationalmarginalprices (LMPs) give locationalmarket-basedincentives for short- term operationandlong-term expansion.LMPs canalsoenableprice-basedandefﬁcient curtailmentof wind generationduring periods with surplus wind power generation,which are typically caused by a combinationof transmission bottlenecks and minimum generationlimits for thennalpower plants.LMPs alsoprovide efﬁcientincentives for locationof new wind power generation,takingnetwork congestion into account. The experience with WPF, however, is relativelylimited so far.A briefsummaryof the current stateof WPF for MISO, New York ISO (NYISO), PJM, ERCOT, andCaliforniaISO (CAISO) is provided in Table3-1. A typicaltimeline for the operationof the electricity marketis shown in Fig. 3-2. The procedures andtimeline in the ﬁgurearebasedon the current rules in the MISO market.However, other ISO/RTO marketsareoperatedin asimilarway.The mainsteps in the marketoperations,including determinationof reserve requirements, DA operations,reliability assessmentcommitment, andRT operations,arediscussed below.As indicatedin Fig. 3-2, WPF canplayanimportantrole in allof these steps aswind power penetrationincreases. 3.3.1 OperatingReserve Requirements The requirements for operating reserves in U.S. power systems are basedon standards determined bythe NERC [47]. Operatingreserves arecategorizedinto severaltypes depending on how quickly they canrespond to changesin the system (Fig. 3-3). The regulatingreserve responds immediatelyto balancingneeds in the system, andis usuallyprovided bygenerating units with automaticgeneration control (AGC) responding to frequency deviations in the network. Contingency reserves are used to respond to contingencies that may occur, such as forced outagesof generatorsor transmissionlines. The contingency reserve canbesplit into spinning andnon-spinning reserves, where the spinning component needs to beableto respond within 10 minutes. It is common thatbothgenerationanddemandresources canprovide contingency reserves. In the event thatoperatingreserves need to beused due to acontingency in the system, the required level of reserve must berestored assoon aspossibleandatleastwithin 60 minutes [47]. 25 Prepare and submit DA bids Clear DA market using SCUC/SCED Post-DA RAC using SCUC Post results (DA energy and reserves) Re- bidding for RAC DA – day ahead RT – real time SCUC – security constr. unit commitment SCED – security constr. economic dispatch RAC – reliability ass. commitment Post operating reserve requirements Prepare and submit RT bids Clear RT market using SCED (every 5 min) Intraday RAC using SCUC Post results (RT energy and reserves) Wind power forecasting The ISO/RTOs arerequired to maintainsufﬁcientregulatingreserve to meet NERC’scriterion for areacontrol error.4 The requirement for contingency reserves is basedon the N-1 rule, thatis, thatsufﬁcientcontingency reserve must beheld to cover “theloss of generatingcapacitydue to forced outagesof generationor transmissionequipment thatwould result from the most severe single contingency.”At leasthalfof the contingency reserve must bespinning. These arethe minimum requirements set byNERC; however, regionalvariationsexist andsome ISO/RTOs use more stringent requirements for their operatingreserves. In systems with largeandcongested networks, it is common to specify regionalreserve requirements in additionto the system-wide criteria. It is alsointeresting to note thatsome marketshaveintroduced ademandcurve for different types of operatingreserves ratherthanthe traditionalﬁxedrequirements. Operating reserve requirements may be updated to accommodatechanges in the system conditions. Although the updatefrequency variesbetweendifferent markets(seasonal,monthly, anddaily updating),the requirements for the next operatingdaymust beposted atleastbeforeoperationof the DA marketbegins.

Severalimprovements to existing requirements andprocedures arerelevant,including: 1. New deﬁnitionsof operatingreserve requirements thatbetterreﬂectthe needs in power systems with alargeshareof renewableenergy. For instance,changesin wind power output unfold much more slowly thanthe traditionalcontingencies, which arecausedby sudden equipment failures.Hence, the system operatorhasmore time to respond to these changes, andaslower type of reserve thanthe current contingency reserves (at least slower thanthe current spinning reserves) maybesufﬁcient.At the sametime, it is less criticalto replacethese reserves immediately,asasecond down-rampevent is not likely, andoftentimes not even possible,if there hasalreadybeenone majorreduction in wind power generation.An additionaltype of “renewablesreserve”is therefore proposed in Fig. 3-3. Such areserve categorywould haveslower response andrestorationtimes and so should beless expensive thanthe traditionalcontingency reserves. There is alsolikely to be aneed for additionalregulationreserves. However, the short dispatchintervals reduce the need for regulationto handleshort-term variabilityin wind generation.Better short-term wind power forecasts would also limit the amount of regulationreserves needed. 2. Improved determination of reserve requirements to better accommodate the characteristicsof wind power andother renewablegeneration.Traditionaldeterministic criteria(e.g., loss of the largestunit in the system) should bereplacedwith probabilistic approachesthat directly reﬂectthe uncertain nature of supply and demand. Ideally, probabilisticwind power forecastsshould beused in the calculationof improved reserve requirements thataccountfor the risk of losing loaddue to wind generationforecast errors in additionto forced outages and unexpected changes in load. The historical forecasting errors should also be taken into account. Ongoing research looks at probabilisticdeterminationof optimalspinning reserve criteria[30] [48] in systems with high wind power capacity,aswell asdemandcurves for operatingreserves [49]. 28 3. Dynamicandfrequent updatingof operatingreserve requirements basedon the most updatedsystem information,including the most recent wind power forecast. This will result in better-informeddecisions, andthus in more efﬁcientoperations.More frequent updating of reserve requirements would enableoperating reserves to be adjusted accordingto how much wind generationis forecastedfor the next hours anddays,aswell asthe projected uncertaintyin the forecast. Several ISO/RTOs are currently considering the need to change their procedures and requirements for operatingreserves. ERCOT, which is the ISO/RTO with the highest level of wind power capacityin the United States (Table3-1), is alreadyconsidering wind power penetrationandforecastinguncertaintyin their determinationof requirements for regulationand non-spinning reserves [50]. In arecent study of the ancillaryservices requirements in ERCOT [51], GE recommends thatERCOT makeadjustmentsto its procedures as the level of wind power generationincreases,pointing out the importanceof makingbetteruse of forecastingin the procurement of different types of operatingreserves, andthatthe level of reserves should be adaptedto actualconditions. 3.3.2 Day-AheadOperations The deadline for marketparticipantsto bidinto the DA market varies among the different ISO/RTOs, asshown in Table3-1. The bidsof the marketparticipantsmust reﬂecthow much energy and operating reserves they can provide. Information on unit commitment (UC) constraints(e.g., rampingrates,startupcosts/times, minimum down-times, etc., for generating units), self-scheduling, andbilateralschedules is alsoprovided to the ISO/RTO. The clearing of the DA market is atwo-stage procedure in most markets. First, a security constrainedunit commitment (SCUC) is run to commit resources. Second, asecurity-constrained economic dispatch(SCED) algorithmis run basedon the commitment schedule from the SCUC. Transmissionconstraintsmaybesimpliﬁedor omitted from the SCUC formulationto solve the problemin areasonabletime. In contrast,the transmissionconstraintsarealwaysincluded in the SCED formulation,althoughusuallywith asimpliﬁedlinearrepresentation(DC-OPF). In most U.S. markets, the SCUC/SCED procedure co-optimizes energy and operating reserves. The output from the DA market clearingtherefore includes schedules for energy and operating reserves. In addition,LMPs arederived for eachtransmissionnode, andmarket-clearingprices arealsocalculatedfor eachcategoryof operatingreserves. In the United States, about70% of the installedwind power through 2008 wassold through Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs), mainly to utilities [52]. Most of the wind power generationis therefore not beingbiddirectly into the DA marketbythe wind power producers, butratheris integratedinto the utilities’scheduling plans,alongwith loadsandother generating resources. It is therefore hardto estimateto whatextent wind power forecastsaretakeninto accountin the bidsandschedules submittedinto the DA market.In manycases,wind power generationis ﬁrstbeingdispatchedin the RT market.This maybeone of the reasonswhy RT prices currently tend to belower thanDA prices in areaswith largewind penetrationsWind 5 As anexample,within MISO’sfootprint in 2009, the averageRT prices in areaswith asubstantialamountof wind energy (like North Dakota,Iowa,andIllinois) were asmuch as5% lower thanaverageDA prices. The difference betweenDA andRT prices wasonly 1—2% in the easternpartof the MISO footprint, which hasless wind. 29 power producers maytherefore beneﬁtfrom using wind power forecaststo bidinto the DA marketandtherebyreceive ahigher andless volatileprice.6 It is importantto integratethe informationin wind power forecastsinto the DA marketclearing. Wind power will haveanincreasingimpacton the marginalcost of electricity, andthis should be properly reﬂectedin the DA marketclearing,where most of the energy is settled. For the DA marketto reﬂectthe expected RT conditions asclosely aspossible,it is importantthatthe market participantshave the right incentives to provide the best possible wind power forecast infonnationthrough their bids.Since the DA operationshould bemarket-drivenandbasedon the marketparticipants’schedules andbids,the system operatorshould not use its own forecastto directly represent wind power generationin the SCUC/SCED procedure in the DA market.The system operators’forecast information should still be reﬂected in the operating reserve requirements, asdiscussed above,andin this waywould alsoinﬂuencethe marketresults. One wayto encourageparticipationof wind power generationin the DA marketwould beto reduce the time period betweenDA biddingandRT operations.The due times for DA bidsvary amongmarkets,butareatleast 12 hours beforethe startof the operatingday(Table3-1). By shortening the time period andpossiblyintroducing additionalmarketsbetweenDA andRT, the marketparticipants,andparticularlythe wind power producers, could clearlymakebetteruse of forecast information, as the forecast error decreases with ashorter time horizon. It is also importantto avoidsituationsin which marketparticipantsareincentivized to submitbiasedDA bids.As anexample,the ERCOT marketused to haveprotocols thatunintentionallygavewind power producers in some areasincentives to over-schedule, due to allowancesfor uninstructed deviationscombinedwith rules for congestion management[53]. In the Iberianelectricity market (SpainandPortugal), asymmetricdeviationpenaltiesmakeit more attractivefor wind power producers to bidabovetheir expected generation[42]. 3.3.3 ReliabilityAssessment Commitment After the clearingof the DA marketandbeforethe startof the operatingday,the ISO/RTO usuallyperforms arevised commitment procedure, with more focus on reliability.The so-called reliabilityassessmentcommitment (RAC) is alsoperformed using SCUC. However, atthis stage the demandbidsthatwere used to clearthe DA marketarereplacedwith the forecastedloadfor the next day.The ISO/RTO maytherefore decide to changethe commitment schedule from the DA marketclearingbasedon the results from the RAC. The RAC procedure maytakeplace accordingto aﬁxedtime schedule or whenever the system operatorﬁndsit necessaryto consider system re-commitment, due to unexpected operatingconditions (forced outages,deviationsfrom forecasted loads, etc.). Rules are typically in place to make sure that generating resources committed in the RAC recover allof their operatingcosts. This maysometimes require make- whole side payments,in additionto the regularpaymentsbasedon the marketclearingprices, in order to recover allcosts (including no-loadcosts, start-upcosts, etc.). ISO/RTOs arecurrently focusing on how to integratethe informationin wind power forecasts into the RAC. In contrastto the DA marketclearing,the system operatorcannow use its own 6 By using wind power forecasting for scheduling andbidding, wind power producers may alsoreduce their exposure to negativeprices andlower their imbalancepenalties(if such penaltiesexist). This is discussed in more detailin Chapter7. In addition,WPF canplayanimportantrole in maintenanceplanning. 30 forecast infonnation directly as input to the SCUC. Hence, both demand and wind power bids/schedules arereplacedwith the system operators’own forecastinformationin order to ensure reliableoperation.An importantquestion is how to consider the additionaluncertainty from wind power atthis stagein the marketoperation. One canaddressthe uncertaintyand variabilityfrom wind power byadjustingandincreasingthe operatingreserve requirements, as discussed above.However, the treatmentof wind resources in the RAC will alsoinﬂuencehow much other generationcapacityis committed andavailableto accommodatethe predicted and unpredicted system variability. An interesting approachis takenbyERCOT, which is currently using an 80% exceedance forecast7 for wind power generation as input to its DA resource planningprocedures [54]. ERCOT is considering whether to use the sametype of forecastin the RAC asthe nodalmarket system is introduced. In reality,using aconservativeprojection of wind power meansthatmore capacityis committed thanwhatwould bethe caseif the meanor medianforecastwere used. Hence, while the resulting security marginmayincreasethe reliabilityof the system, repeated over-commitment would result in inefﬁcientoperations. An alternativewayto addressthe uncertaintyfrom wind power generationis to use astochastic formulationof the UC problem.Severaldifferent approacheshavebeenproposed in the literature recently to address uncertainty from wind power generation in the UC problem [55][56][57][58][59][60]. Preliminaryresults indicatethatstochasticmodels cancontributeto reducing costs while maintainingsystem security under increaseduncertaintyandvariability. However, more researchis needed into developing andtesting stochasticmodels for UC andinto evaluatingtheir real-worldapplicabilityfor system andmarketoperations. In particular,it is importantto generateconsistent andrepresentativeinformationaboutthe forecastuncertaintyfor use in such stochasticmodels. It is alsoimportantto consider the close interactionbetweenthe operatingreserve requirements andthe UC policy becausethey bothinﬂuencethe level of committed andavailablecapacity.An importantconsiderationis thatwhile capacitycommitted as operatingreserve receives reserve payments,additionalcapacitycommitted in the RAC is likely to receive make-wholeside paymentsto recover costs, aspointed out above.The required level of capacityshould beachievedin the most cost-efﬁcientmanner.Some of these issues are further explored in Chapters4, 5, and6. Another potentialapplicationof awind power uncertaintyforecastatthis stagein the market operationis in congestion managementanalysisto assessthe risk of congestion in some network branchesandperform corrective measuresto hedge againstahigher risk of congestion [61]. 3.3.4 Real-timeOperations Marketparticipantscanbidtheir remainingresources into the RT market. The deadline for submittingbidsto the RT marketvariesquite widely betweendifferent markets(Table3-1).” During the operatinghour, the ISO/RTO uses SCED to dispatchthe system on the basisof the committed capacityin the system afterthe DA andRAC operationshavebeencompleted. At the sametime, RT prices for energy (LMPs) andoperatingreserves arecalculated.Conventional 7 This meansthatthere is an80% chancethatthe actualwind power generationwill exceed the forecast.Hence, it is equivalentto a20% forecastquantile. 8 Some ISO/RTOs, like NYISO andCAISO, alsohaveaformalhour-aheadmarketclearingprocedure. 3] power generationsources arepenalizedif they deviatefrom their RT dispatchsignals.Until recently, however, renewablegenerationsuch aswind power hasnot beengiven dispatchsignals from the ISO/RTO andhastypicallybeendispatchedasaprice takerin the RT market.Wind power generationalsohasexemptions from RT deviationpenaltiesin most markets(Table3-1). ISO/RTOs are currently working on improving the integrationof wind power into their RT dispatchprocedures. Short-term wind power forecasts,which haverelativelylow uncertainty, should betakeninto accountin the ISO/RTOs’RT SCED. At the sametime, it is importantthat the ISO/RTO is ableto control the generationfrom wind power plantsandenforce curtailmentof wind power generationin situationswhere this is needed, either from aneconomic or reliability perspective.’CAISO is requiring wind power plantsin the ParticipatingIntermittent Resource Program(PIRP) to bidinto their hour-aheadmarketaccordingto CAISO’sshort-term wind power forecast.Rules arealsoin placeto limit the deviationpenaltiesfor wind power (Table 3-1). NYISO recently introduced new rules to incorporatewind power in its SCED [62]. With the new rules, wind power plantswill berequired to bidinto the RT market.A price-bidis offered into the market basedon the wind power producer’spreference, whereas the bid quantity is determined by the system operator’sshort-term wind power forecast. During unconstrained hours, wind power plantscanoperatefreely. However, in constrainedsituations,wind power plantsaredirected to curtailtheir output when the clearingprice attheir locationfallsbelowtheir economic bid.Penaltiesarein placefor exceeding the dispatchinstructions. The new procedure makescertainthatthe economic preferences of the wind power producers arereﬂectedin the SCED. It alsocontributesto amore efﬁcientdispatchoverallandreduces the need for using out- of-marketactions to maintainsystem reliability.PJM has also introduced a scheme for RT dispatchof wind power plantsbasedon their bids. Other ISO/RTOs should consider similar measuresto improve the handlingof wind power resources in the RT dispatch. 3.4 SummaryandConclusions WPF is animportanttool to improve the efﬁciencyandreliabilityof power systems with alarge shareof wind power. ISO/RTOs in the United Statesarecurrently working on integratingwind power forecasts into their operatingprocedures, andWPF is alreadyused for anumberof importantapplicationsloHowever, asthe amountof wind power capacityis rapidlyincreasing, there is aneed to betterintegrateWPF into different partsof electricity marketoperations,from DA scheduling to RT operations. It is alsoimportantto design electricity marketsthatgive market participantsthe opportunity and right incentives to provide their unbiasedforecast informationthrough their scheduling andbidding. Fig. 3-4 summarizeshow we foresee thatWPF will playimportantroles in the mainsteps in electricity marketoperations.ISO/RTOs andmarketparticipantswill need to develop new tools andprocedures to makeefﬁcientuse of the forecastinformation,with the overallgoalof making 9 Modern wind power plantsinclude anumberof featuresthatmakethem more similarto conventionalpower plants,including reactivepower contribution,voltageregulation,disturbanceride-through, grid frequency response, smoothing wind ramps,andcontrolled startup/shutdown. 10 More informationon the statusof the integrationof wind power andforecastingin U.S. ISO/RTOS is provided by UWIG in [63][64]. 32 Re-bidding/Scheduling Wind Power Projection Wind Power Projection Real-Time Schedules Supply Bids/Schedules Reserve Requirements betteroperationaldecisions under the increaseduncertaintyandvariabilityfrom wind power and other sources of renewablegeneration.A key challenge,therefore, is to improve decision making under uncertaintyandthe understandingof the impactof uncertaintyon operationaldecisions (such asUC). At the sametime, it is importantto continue the improvements of WPF models, and to better tune them to the speciﬁcneeds of the forecast users. For electricity market operators,it is particularlyimportantto improve predictions of forecastuncertaintyandramping events.

While deterministic approachesuse apoint forecastof wind power output, WPF uncertaintyin the stochasticUC alternativeis capturedbyanumberof scenariosthatinclude cross-temporal dependency. A comparison among adiversity of UC strategies (basedon aset of realistic experiments) is presented. The results indicatethatrepresenting WPF uncertaintywith wind power scenariosthatrely on stochasticUC hasadvantagesover deterministic approachesthat mimic the classicalmodels. Moreover, the stochasticmodel provides arationalandadaptiveway to provide adequatespinning reserves at every hour, as opposed to increasing reserves to predeﬁned,ﬁxedmarginsthatcannotaccounteither for the system’scosts or its assumedrisks.

Two key elements of this uncertainty— the inherent intermittency and the variabilityof renewableresources — are thus driving system operators to alter current industry approachesto UC andED. Whereasconsiderableresearcheffort hasbeendirected to formulatingandimproving UC algorithms[65], efforts to consider wind power uncertaintyhave beenmore limited to date. This chapterinvestigatesthe use of multiple wind power forecastsin UC andED andanalyzes the impactof different reserve requirements andUC policies on system operation.Our aimis to demonstratethat,despite the inherent uncertaintiesandrisks when relying on wind power, it is possiblefor operatorsto adoptaquantiﬁedmethod to dealaccuratelywith this renewablesource. There areseveralreasonswhy UC andED aregreatlyimpactedwhen largeamountsof wind energy arepartof the mix of generationsources. First of all,WPF errors bringgreaterlevels of uncertaintyto system operation,becausethe RT amountof injected wind power maybevery different from whatis forecasted.Forecastingerrors, which aremismatchesbetweenthe value(s) plugged in during the UC stageversus the amountsused in the RT dispatch,cancausegreat difﬁcultyfor system operators,who must balancethe unexpected surpluses or deﬁcitsof wind power. 36 This forecastinguncertaintycanbemanifestedin several ways. For example, anunforeseen reduction in wind power canhinder system reliabilityif the availableramping-upcapabilitiesof the system’sother on-line units are not sufﬁcientto accommodatethe current load. A large upwardrampin the supply of wind power maybeunfavorable,however, in asystem in which other units lacksufﬁcientdownwardreserves. Wind power is sometimes curtailedto mitigate this situation,which nevertheless leadsto anunwantedwasteof availableresources. In fact,a surplus in wind power atnight mayoften haveto becurtailed:while the wind maybestrong, system loadis usuallylow. In this case,wind generationmayhaveto bespilled to maintain stableoperation of thennal units (e.g., coal-ﬁred,nuclear) becauseof their physical and/or economic constraints. Variabilityis also achallenge for generation scheduling: becausewind power is normally assumedto haveanoperatingcost of zero, system operatorstry to makeuse of wind power as often aspossible.To meet this objective,however, the output of other generationsources must be adjusted to accommodatewind power variability,which complicates scheduling the generationof non-wind resources. Therefore, even if wind power could beforecastedperfectly, variabilitybyitself (i.e., considered in isolation)would still beimportant,becausethe system must still operatewithin the physicalconstraintsof other non-wind units, such astheir ramping- up/-down constraintsandminimum-on/minimum-off time constraints,etc. These uncertainty factors complicate the challenges that operators and researchers face in revising andadjustingUC andED algorithmsto accommodatewind power, resulting in avariety of approaches.Some researchers focus on revising the current security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) formulation.Others aimatnovel UC methods. Barthet al. [55] presented the earlystageof the Wind Power Integrationin the LiberalisedElectricity Markets(WILMAR) model in [66]. Tuohy et al. [59] extended their previous studies in [67] and[68] to examinethe effects of stochasticwind andloadon the UC andED of power systems with high levels of wind power byusing the WILMAR model. The WILMAR model calculatesbothUC decisions and the associatedRT dispatchdecisions using arolling planningapproachthatuses realizedwind power production andloadin the ﬁrststageof the scenariotrees. Ummels et al.[69] analyzedthe impactsof wind power on thermalgenerationUC andED in the Dutch system, which hasa signiﬁcantshareof combinedheatandpower (CHP) units. BoujfardandGaliana[56] proposed astochasticUC model to integratesigniﬁcantwind power generationwhile maintainingthe security of the system. Ruiz et al. [70] proposed astochasticformulationto manageuncertainty in the UC problem.In arelatedpaper[58], the authorsconsider uncertaintyandvariabilityin wind power in the UC problembyusing the same stochastic framework. Wangetal. [57] presented an SCUC algorithm that takes the intermittency and variabilityof wind power generationinto account.DelarueandD’haeseleer[71] develop amixed-integer programming model to analyzethe valueof forecastingin unit commitment. Most of the models presented in the literatureso far,however, areused for planning(i.e., UC) purposes (e.g., [55][57][58][66]— [70]), while there is only very limited researchthatexplores the use of different WPF methods in actualmarketoperation: in other words, the linkagebetweenDA UC andRT ED is largely missing. To dealwith these issues in this chapter,we use (1) point andprobabilisticforecastsof wind power thataregeneratedbystate-of-the-arttechniques, and(2) two different methods: stochastic 37 anddeterministic. The consequences of aUC schedule to system costs arethen assessedby running adispatchsimulationthattakesinto accountthe actualvalueof wind power insteadof forecastedvalues.The relationshipbetweenUC policies andreserve requirements is discussed in the context of the large uncertainties arising from reliance on wind power. With added uncertainty,the focus shifts to considering some amountof extrareserve margin(e.g., see [72] and[73]). A detailedprobabilisticanalysisof the impactof renewablesources in the power system of the IberianPeninsulais given in [74]. A methodology to deﬁneoperatingreserve considering conventionalgenerationoutages,loadforecastuncertainty,andwind power forecast uncertaintyis describedin [75]. Probabilisticforecastsareused for wind power. In [76], asurvey of the methods of determining the optimalamountof operatingreserves for systems with high wind penetrationsis presented, showing thatvariousmethods mayhavesigniﬁcantlydifferent results. The challenge, therefore, is to deﬁnethe amount of reserve needed for each hour adaptivelyandadequatelyinsteadof aimingatanarbitrarilyﬁxedvaluefor the required reserve. To contributeto this discussion, anumberof casesaresimulatedin order to analyzeandcompare the results in detail. In this study, a24-hour optimizationprocedure is run atthe beginningof the RT operationto represent the RT dispatch(assumingperfect knowledge of wind power in the following hours of the day).This way,the realcost of operationmaybeassessedfairlyfor comparison.Therefore, this constitutes alower boundfor the realcost of operationfor agiven commitment. In reality, there is still uncertaintyin wind power for the subsequenttime steps in relationto the current hour. This approachhasthe merit of takinginto accountthe rampingconstraintsfor the thermal units acrossthe 24-hour operationhorizon. In addition,becausethe objectiveis to compareUC models, we wantedto avoidblurringthe analysisbysimultaneouslyintroducing amodel for the ED that also included the uncertainty component. For similarreasons, we do not consider commitment decisions betweenDA scheduling andRT dispatch.In reality,the SO usuallyhas some ﬂexibilityto commit additionalfast-startingresources afterthe DA UC to accountfor any unexpected events, such asWPF deviations.This ﬂexibilitywill contributeto improve the RT operationregardlessof the DA UC strategy.However, in order to isolatethe effect of the DA UC, we do not consider the impactof intra-daycommitments in this analysis. The rest of the chapter is organized as follows: Section 4.2 brieﬂydescribes WPF andthe scenariogenerationmethod we used. Section 4.3 presents the problemformulation.Numerical examplesareprovided in Section 4.4 Section 4.5 presents conclusions basedon the discussion. 4.2 ForecastingandScenarioGenerationApproaches An advancedWPF system uses input datafrom different sources, andthe forecastaccuracy depends on anumberof factors,including numericalweatherprediction (NWP) models andthe qualityof wind predictions, localmeteorologicalmeasurements,SCADA data(e.g., activepower generated),andadditionalinformation(e.g., on the characteristicsof the wind power plants,the complexity of the terrain,the availabilityof RT weatherandpower plantdata).Largedifferences in forecastingerrors canoccur amongwind power plantsatdifferent locations.WPF systems typicallyproduce forecastsfor atime horizon of up to 2—3 daysaheadof the present time. In general, the forecasting error increases with the forecast horizon. We provide a detailed description of the state-of-the-artin WPF in [1]. 38 There areseveraldifferent approachesto model uncertaintyin wind power predictions [1]. In this chapter,we use the approachfrom [77] to produce probabilisticforecastsbasedon point forecasterrors. The model employs alinearquantileregression, where the baseﬁrnctionsare formulatedascubicB-splines, in order to obtainthe quantilewith aproportion of the forecast errors. The probabilisticforecastis represented through aset of quantilesrangingfrom 5% to 95% (in 5% increments), and the tails are modeled by exponential interpolation reﬂecting improbableandextreme events [77]. Since the probabilisticforecasts (i.e., set of quantiles) produced by the quantile regression method do not capturethe temporal correlationbetweenforecast errors (i.e., uncertainty)of different hours, ascenariogenerationmethod describedin [78] is used to generateanumberof wind power scenarios thatprovide informationon the development of the prediction errors through the set of look-aheadtimes. The method takesasinputs the forecastedquantilesfor each look-aheadtime-step and also the observed wind power generation. Assuming that the probabilisticforecasts are reliable,the forecast errors are made Gaussianby applying a transformationwith the inverse of the Gaussiancumulativedistributionfunction. This results in a Gaussianrandomvariablewith zero meanandunit standarddeviation.Considering the vector with allthe forecastsfor eachlook-aheadtime-step, it is assumedthatthe randomvector follows amultivariateGaussiandistribution,with meanvaluesbeingavector of zeros andacovariance matrix.The temporalinterdependence structure is represented bythe covariancematrix,which is recursively estimated becauseof the nonstationarycharacteristics.A speciﬁed number of scenariosareobtainedthrough samplingfrom aninverse cumulativedistributionfunction. More detailsaboutthe method canbefound in [78]. The scenariosproduced bythe method havethe following characteristics:(i) they respect the marginalwind power forecasteddistributionfor the coming horizon (i.e., probabilisticforecasts);and(ii) the temporalcorrelationof forecasterrors areembeddedin the scenariosvalues. 4.3 Unit Commitment andDispatchFormulations The UC anddispatchformulationsused in this chapterexpandon our initialversion of the UC problemintroduced in [60]. The generalUC constraintsfollow the deterministic model in [79]. However, we make adjustments in the stochastic version on the basisof introducing WPF uncertainty,which is represented in the form of scenarios. 4.3.1 ObjectiveFunction The objectiveis to minimize the sum of three kinds of costs: expected production costs, the expected cost of unserved energy andreserve curtailment,andstart-upcosts, asshown in (4-1). Constraintson loadandoperatingreserves arerepresented in (4-2)—(4-3). We use astep-wise reserve demandcurve to mimic the reserve requirement practicedbysome system operators, such asMISO [80], asshown in (4-4). This formulationallowsthe reserve requirement, which is represented by a certain percentage of load, to be reduced in some cases at the reserve curtailmentcost capturedin (4-1) to avoidloadcurtailment.We alsointroduce the possibilityof dedicatinganadditionaloperatingreserve atthe DA UC stagespeciﬁcallyfor use with wind power generation.The ideais thatthis wind power reserve helps accommodatethe uncertainty andvariabilitythatarise from reliance on wind units. Wind units mayalsobe curtailed, if necessary,asshown in (4-5). Note thatthe dispatchof thermalunits — andtherefore the costs associatedwith production, curtailed energy, and reserve — all vary by wind scenario. 39 Furthermore, the constraintsfor load,operatingreserves, andwind curtailmentmust bemet in all wind scenarios. In contrast,thermalunits’start-upcosts areindependent of the variouswind scenariosbecausewe assumethatthe commitment of thermalunits hasto beﬁxedatthe DA stage. We alsoassumethateachthermalunit is offered into the marketasastep-wise, price-quantity offer function andthatthe offers canbederived bylinearizingastandardquadraticproduction cost function. Thus, we canexpress the operatingcost for one thermalunit with the equationsin (4-6)—(4-9). The coefﬁcientsfor the generationblocksarederived from the quadraticproduction cost function. The lastpartof the objectivefunction is the start-upcost, which is modeled by assumingthatthere is acold start-upcost andawarmstart-upcost, depending on the length of time thatagiven unit hasbeenrampeddown. The mathematicalformulationis shown in (4-10)- (4-12). 4.3.2 ThermalUnit Constraints The constraintsfor the operationof thermalunits include generationlimits, ramping-upand -down limits, andminimum-up andminimum-down time. The upper andlower generationlimits for the thermalplantsareshown in (4-13). The maximumpower output of aunit, ﬁk),is constrainedbythe generationlimit of aunit in (4-14), limitationson start-upandramp-uprates in (4-15), shut-down rampratesin (4-16), andramp-downlimits in (4-17). The availabilityof spinning reserves is equalto the difference betweenthe maximumpotentialgenerationandthe actualgeneration,thatis, Tf(k) — pt; . Thus, the reserve requirement in (4-3) takesinto account the constraints imposed by (4-13)—(4-17). The reserve requirement is maintainedfor each individualwind scenario. The ﬁnalconstraintsincluded arethe minimum-up and-down time constraints.Minimum-up times arerepresented by(4-18)—(4-20), which represent the initialstatus,the intermediatetime periods, andthe ﬁnaltime steps of the planningperiod, respectively. The minimum-down time constraintsarerepresented analogouslyby(4-21)—(4-23). Note thatthe equationsfor generation andrampinglimits, (4-13)—(4-17), must beincluded for allwind scenarios, becausethermal dispatch depends on the wind generation. In contrast, the minimum-up and -down time constraints, (4-18)—(4-23), are functions of commitment only and do not vary with wind scenarios. Note that the calculationof the '1}-”p'0variabledepends on the initial state and minimumon time constraintsof the unit. If the unit hasbeenon for less thanthe minimum on time, the unit hasto remainon until it meets the minimum on time constraint.A similarlogic applies to T}-“mo as well. For simplicity’ssake, transmission constraints are currently not represented in the model, althoughtheir absencedoes not changethe conclusions qualitatively. 40 Min Zprobs- s 1 + 2 2 @}*(1<) k=1j=1 >-\\ 3 (I) K;¢/\\-'7-ra- \\-ra- QT‘? >< ra-M- S s.t.

In such a case, the formulation would be equivalent to a deterministic version of the UC problem. The selected scenariocould bethe expected wind power generationor point forecastor could alsorepresent acertainquantilein the forecasting probabilitydistribution.This formulationis useful for comparisonpurposes. 4.3.4 Economic Dispatch In order to assessthe dispatchcost in RT, we alsodevelop anED formulation.The commitment variablesare now assumedto be ﬁxedfrom the UC run. The representationof wind power generationbyscenarios is replacedbythe realizedwind power output (without considering potentialwind power curtailment).Hence, we formulateadeterministic ED problemconsisting of equations(4-1)—(4-9) and(4-13)—(4-17), with only one wind power scenarioandﬁxedvalues for the thermalcommitment variables,v]-(k). The start-upcost andminimum-up and-down time constraintsarenot considered becauseof the ﬁxedcommitment. Rampingconstraints arein (4-13)—(4-17), andthe 24-hour problemis solved in one shot. Notably,the operatingreserve requirement in (4-3) is alsoimposed in the ED formulation.As discussed in the introduction, we assumethatthe dispatchis carriedout with perfect knowledge of the actualwind power being injected into the system for future time steps. 42 A marketsimulationhasbeenset up thatﬁrstsolves the UC bymakinguse of the wind power forecast,andthen solves the ED byusing the realizedwind conditions. This actionis performed in sequence for multiple days.An updatedwind power forecast,alongwith the unit statusand generationoutput for the thermalunits from the previous day,aretakenasinitialconditions for the UC problemfor the next day.The mainresults (UC, dispatch,availablereserves, unserved load,curtailedreserve, prices, etc.) arecalculatedandstored aftereachsimulationday. Becausethe focus is on quantifyingthe impactof wind power forecastson system operation,the only uncertaintywe consider derives from wind generation.Other uncertainties,such asloador forced outage,arenot considered directly. We assumethatoperatingreserves maintainedin the RT dispatchandbasedon classicalcriteriaareadequateto accommodatethese uncertainties.As aresult, the additionalamount of “windpower reserve”becomes criticalto addressing the impactof uncertaintywhen using wind power. With the stochasticUC formulation,the need for additionaloperatingreserves is arguablyalreadyaddressedbecausewe include arepresentative set of wind power outcomes in the scenarios.However, even if the scenariosarehighly accurate in capturingallof the possiblewind power outputs, additionalreserve maybeneeded even in the stochasticformulationto cover anyextrauncertaintythatthe simulatedscenariosarenot ableto capture.In the casestudy below,we run anumberof different casesto investigatethe impactof UC strategyandoperatingreserve policy on the system dispatch. 4.4 CaseStudy 4.4.1 Assumptions To provide adidacticandclearcasestudy, we use atest power system to simulatethe impactof using different wind power forecastsandoperatingreserve policies. The UC andED arerun in sequence asdescribedabove.The mainassumptionsfor the casestudy areoutlined below. The characteristicsof the thennalpower plantsarebasedon the casestudies presented in [79] and[81], althoughwe havemodiﬁedsome of the cost coefﬁcientsandalsointroduced datafor rampingrates.The resulting input parametersareshown in Table4-1. Eachunit is represented with four blocksof equal size. The bidprice of eachblockis calculatedbylinearizingthe quadraticcost function. The production cost increasesfrom baseloadunits to peakunits. The hourly proﬁleof the loadsis takenfrom the historicaldatafor two utilities in the stateof Illinois for the three months of Octoberthrough Decemberof 2006. The overallloadlevel is scaled down to matchthe generationcapacityin the test power system. The operatingreserve (spinning) requirement in the UC formulationis assumedto be10% of the system loadasthe defaultvalue.The required operatingreserves haveto bemet bythe thermal power plants(i.e., wind power plantscannotprovide reserves). Note thatthe stochasticmodel allowsthe use of different reserve requirements in eachscenario.In the casestudy, however, we use the samevaluein allscenarios.We investigatethe consequences of increasingthe reserve requirement in the UC, asdiscussed above,whereasthe reserve requirement is kept constantat 10% of loadin the ED problem,representing RT operations.We assumeonly one step in the spinning reserve demandcurve. The cost of reserve curtailmentis $1,100/MWh, andthe cost of unserved energy is $3,500/MWh, which corresponds to the current practiceatthe MISO in the 43 United States [82]. Thus, reserves will becurtailedaheadof load.It should benoted thatthe computationalresults areinﬂuencedbythese penaltyprices for unserved loadandreserve Table4-1 Generatordata. W _ RLj a up dn-Pisa.

The datawere produced bycombiningamesoscaleweathermodel with acomposite power curve for anumber of potentialsites for wind power farms.The DA forecastswere generatedbasedon observed forecasterrors from four realwind power plants.The datamethodology is explainedin [84]. Datafor the 15 sites were aggregatedinto one time series. The accuracyof the DA wind power forecastvaries from dayto day. For the point forecast, the normalizedmeanaverageerrors (NMAEs) over a91-daysimulationperiod varybetween8.4% and12.4% for different hours of the day,with the highest forecasterrors occurring in the afternoonbetweennoon and6:00 p.m. The totalinstalledcapacityof wind power is assumedto be500 MW, andfor simplicity we model this amountasone largewind power plant.For the simulatedperiod, the wind power capacityfactor is 39.9%, and the wind power meets 20.2% of the load (with no wind 12 We haverun sensitivity casestudies on the penaltyprices. The results show that,whereasthe commitment and dispatchof thermalunits do not changemuch, the costs of reserve andloadcurtailmentdo naturallydepend on these values. 44 curtailment).Wind power andloadareuncorrelatedwith acorrelationcoefﬁcientof 0.01. With these assumptions,the totalinstalledcapacityof the thermalunits is 10.8% higher thanthe peak load.If we assignacapacityvalueof 20% to the wind power capacity,the system reserve margin increasesto 17.4%. To generatethe wind power scenarios,we used the wind power data(forecastsandrealized generation)for the period from Januaryto July to trainthe quantileregression, andthen the months from August to Decemberareused asatest dataset.Becausethe ﬁrstmonth is used only to initializethe estimationof the covariancematrix,the scenariosareonly produced for October, November,andDecember. 4.4.3 SimulatedCases To compare the results of using different wind power forecasts and UC formulations (deterministic vs. stochastic),andalsothe different UC policy andreserve requirements, we have conducted tests of alist of 10 simulationcasesassummarizedin Table4-2. The casesarein three subgroups:forecasts,reserve requirements, andstochasticUC. In the forecastssubgroup, the ﬁrstcase(F1) is areference casewith aperfect wind power forecast.CaseF2 uses the wind power point forecast.In caseF3, the UC is performed without considering the use of wind power atall.In F4 andF5, different forecastsin terms of different quantilesareused. F4 uses the 20% quantileforecastinsteadof the point forecast,which is similarto the current practicefor DA scheduling in ERCOT [85]. F5 uses the 50% quantile forecast and aims to investigate the performanceof the medianforecast. Table4-2 Simulatedcases. Case Description UC Forecast SubgroupI —Forecasts F1 Deterministic (Det.)

Scenarios S2 StochasticUC w/additionalreserve (additional5% of load) Stoch. Scenarios The reserve requirements subgroupillustratesthe impactof different reserve requirements on the deterministic UC results. We assumethatabasicreserve requirement of 10% of the loadis adequateto accommodateloadforecasterrors andforced outagesof generatingunits. In R1, an additional20% of the point forecast is added to the reserve requirement to accommodatewind power uncertainty.In other words, the wind reserve, WR(k), in Eq. (4-4) is equalto 20% of the point forecast.In R2, we calculatethe additionalwind reserve requirement 45 bydeducting the 10% quantileforecastfrom the point forecast.Becausethe realizedwind power will most likely behigher thanthe 10% quantileforecast(90% of the time), R2 should beableto accommodatethe uncertaintyin WPF to alargeextent. In R3, we increasethe level of reserves from 10% to 15% of the load,so thatin this case,the additionalwind reserve does not consider the informationin the wind power forecast. Finally, case S1 uses stochastic UC with aregularreserve requirement, and case 2 is the stochasticUC with the additionalreserve (15% of the system loadinsteadof 10% in S1). The stochasticUC casesuse atotalof 10 wind power scenarios,which not alwaysbesufﬁcientto capturethe full rangeof potentialoutcomes for the wind power generationfor the next day.The purpose of increasing the reserve in S2 is to use the additionalreserve to cover the extra uncertaintyin wind power not capturedbythe scenarios. 4.4.4 Results In this section, we provide detailed dispatch results for one selected day and the overall simulationresults to show the short-term impactof different system scheduling methods and longer-term simulationstatisticswith different wind power forecasts. 4.4.5 Results for One Day We present the dispatchresults for day87, which is selected becausethere is arelativelylarge forecasting error on this day. Fig. 4-1 shows thatboth the point forecast andmost of the scenariospredict too much wind power for most of the day.Fig. 4-2 shows the numberof units on-line in casesF2, R3, andS1, which arethe most likely alternativesto represent how system operatorsmayincorporatewind power forecastsinto their UC. In this ﬁgure,we cansee the numberof on-line units in S1 is higher thanin F2 andhigher in R3 thanin S 1. 500 - i ScenarioI 450 - ‘$1“ 400 _ i Scenario2 ? s ' 3 '_‘ 350 _i ‘K i‘ scenario4 . < i cenarro V '_' 300 ' \\ \\ I ” , i Scenario5 , I 250 _ _ ‘A .

A paralleleffect is obtainedwith R3 byimposing ahigher reserve requirement atthe UC stage.Fig. 4-3 shows the level of availableoperatingreserves in the RT dispatch for the three alternatives.The availablecapacitysurplus is derived by subtractingthe dispatch,pt]-(k), from the sum of maximumfeasiblegeneration,E] (k), for each thermalunit andaddingup the results. It is of note thatin F2, the availablecapacitydrops below the required ED reserve requirement for severalhours. This is particularlythe casein hours ll and 12 when there is alarge deviationbetweenthe realizedwind generation andthe point forecast. This deviation causes the use of allof the availablecapacity,including operating reserves, andeventuallyleadsto the loadcurtailmentin those two hours (Fig. 4-3) for F2. In this case,it is evident thatthe stochasticstrategyS1 provided abetteroverallsolution. The availableoperatingreserves from S1 matchwell with the ED reserve requirement in Fig. 4-3 with only minor shortagesin hours 8 and9, while R3 leadsto anexcessive amountof available reserves asshown betweenhours 8 and22 in Fig. 4-3. 4.4.6 Results for aThree-month Period Fig. 4-4 shows the total hours of commitment for the ten thermal units in athree-month simulationperiod. Totalhours of commitment arethe highest in F3, which does not takewind power into accountin the UC andtherefore needs more units to becommitted to compensatefor the absenceof the wind power generation (availablein all of the other cases). This case illustratesthatif system operatorsarenot using the informationin the wind power forecast,the over-commitment of thermalunits mayeasilyresult. The higher reserve requirement in S2, plus the wind uncertainty(represented bythe scenarios),led to ahigh commitment of units in S2, as well. CaseF2 hasthe lowest commitment of units, which leadsto lower availablecapacityfor reserve andhigher curtailment,asshown next. Table4-3 shows the averagedispatchof thermalunits for allof the cases.The results show that the differences in dispatcharerelativelysmallerthanarethe differences in commitment. This result occurs becausethe samerealizedwind generationoutput is used in the RT dispatchin all of the cases.The resulting averagethermaldispatchtherefore becomessimilarin the ten cases, despite the differences in commitment. For the peaking plants, note that they are being dispatchedattheir minimum levels most of the time while committed. 47 6 5 _ _ _ I Z,’ \\_ I I I \\ - = = = I Deterministic (R3) rofunitsonline U0-I> Numbe M 1 — - - - Deterministic (F2) Stochastic(S1) O _l I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 Hour Fig. 4-2 Numberof on-line units for day87. 450 — 1 ED reserve requirement ili Deterministic (F2) 350 ' ' \\ Deterministic (R3) _ X Stochastic(S1) )\\ 400 - ~ 1—i 1_1MW kn8 i Loadcurtailmentin F2 I'€S€I'V€ l\\> ‘J1O !\\ - it \" 150- , .

The totalcost rangesfrom $34.87M in F1 to $48.08M in F2. The totalcost in F3 is lower thanthe operatingcost in F2 asaresult of F2’shigh curtailment cost. The difference betweenF2 andF3 illustratesthe importanceof avoidingextreme errors in WPF, where the wind power forecasthasavery largemagnitudeor phaseerror comparedto the realizedwind power generation.This event could occur within one hour or alimited numberof hours even though the averageforecasterror over the entire period maybesmall.In fact,load curtailmentoccurs in only four hours out of the 91-daysimulationin F2. Nevertheless, reserve curtailmentoccurs asoften as17% of the time in F2. Forecastingerrors alsoleadto reserve curtailment. In these situations,the system operatoris assumedto use the RT operatingreserve intended for unexpected deviationsin loadandthermal generationto accommodatethe WPF errors. These events causegreatchallengesfor system 50 operationsbecausethe generatingunits arenot scheduled accordingly,andsufﬁcientramping capabilityis therefore not available.However, F3 ends up with fuel costs thatarehigher than they are in any of the other scenarios, becausemore high-cost generating units are being dispatchedcomparedto whatis needed, given thatwind power is not considered atallin the UC problem. F4 is the 20% quantileforecast,which meansthatthe realizedwind power is higher thanthis forecastwith aprobabilityof 80%, andis used in placeof the point forecastin the UC. The commitment results show thatmore units arecommitted in F4 comparedto F2 becauseof using the conservativeforecastfor wind power. As aresult, the curtailmentcost andthe totaloperating costs arebothmuch lower in F4 thanin F2. The operatingcost in F5 is much higher thanit is in F3 andF4, which shows thatit is too risky to rely on the 50% quantileforecastin the UC. 4.4.8 Reserve Requirements Subgroup 2 compares the impact of the reserve requirements on the system dispatch. The additionalreserve in this subgroupis meantto compensatefor the WPF error in apredeﬁned manner. This predeﬁnedamountcould be inaccurateas discussed above.The totalhours of commitment in Fig. 4-4 show thatthe three reserve requirements haveasimilareffect on the commitment results becausemore units arerequired to beon-line to provide extrareserve. However, caseR1 suffers from the wind power point forecasterrors, to some extent, becausethe additionalreserve requirement is a function of the point forecast. If the forecast deviates substantiallyfrom the realizedwind power, the resulting reserve maynot besufﬁcientto handle the forecast error. In this subgroup, R2 uses the best strategy. In this case, the possible forecastingerrors arelargelycompensatedfor byusing the largerextrareserve, which is the difference betweenthe point forecastandthe 10% quantileforecast.The operatingcost in R3 turns out to beslightly higher thanthatof R2 becausethe reserve requirement in R3 is linked with the system load,not the WPF. Thus, becausethe loadis not strongly correlatedwith the wind power output, the reserve associatedwith loadmaybeincorrect. In comparisonto subgroup1, the strategiesin R2 andR3 leadto lower costs thanthose of F3 and F4, where no forecastor aconservativeforecastis used. This result shows, asexpected, that increasing the reserve requirements in the deterministic approachhas the effect of better accommodatingwind variabilityanduncertainty.The resulting operatingreserve is higher in R2 andR3 comparedto allof the casesin subgroup1 except F3 (Table4-5). BecauseF3 canbe regardedasthe most conservativewayto commit the units — thatis, byignoring the existence of wind power — the level of realizedoperatingreserves is therefore much higher thanit is in the other cases. 4.4.9 Deterministic vs. StochasticUC Fig. 4-4 shows thatthe units areon more frequently in S1 andS2 thanin the deterministic cases, except in F3 where there is no wind power forecast.This result occurs becausethe units need to beon to provide the additionalrampingcapacityto dealwith the variabilityof wind power output in the scenariosin the stochasticapproach. In the stochasticcasesS1 andS2, we cansee thatthe totaloperatingcosts end up beingclose to deterministic caseF3, which hasno wind power forecast, andcasesR2 andR3, which have 5] additionaloperatingreserves. S2 shows the bestperformancein terms of the totalcost amongall of the casesbecauseboththe wind power variabilityin the scenariosandthe limited accuracyof the scenariogenerationaretakeninto account.For the samereason,the availablereserve is also relativelyhigher in S2. This observationis consistent with [9], where the increasedreserve is used to cover the additionalgeneratoroutagesandloadvariations,which arenot capturedbythe SC€I12t1‘1OS. The results show thatthe UC strategyandthe reserve requirements haveimportantimplications for managingthe costs andreliabilityof power systems with largeamountsof wind power. The rampingcapabilityandreserves provided byon-line units are,to alargeextent, determined by these factors,which therefore inﬂuencethe RT dispatchresults to agreatextent. Again,it should benoted thatthe RT dispatchcanbefurther improved if intra-dayrescheduling of generating units is applied,which is not considered in this chapter. 4.5 Conclusions This chapteranalyzesthe impactof WPF on UC andED. More thanelaboratingon theoretical models, it is importantto assesswhether the difference in decisions, resulting from moving from deterministic models to stochastic programming models, is relevant enough to justify the attentionof the industry to changingthe waythey operatethe system. Therefore, the studies reported in the chapterwere carefullyorganizedin aseries of experiments to cover awhole set of strategicvariants.The results show thatthe addeduncertaintyresulting from WPF uncertainty requires the adoptionof animproved UC policy thatcandeﬁnehigher spinning reserves than those used in classicalsystems that do not rely on wind resources. This result is of major economic impactto system operators. The simplest approachto this requirement of setting alargerreserve marginis to deﬁnealarger ﬁxedvalue(in terms of percentageof the load)for the spinning reserve — so thatnot only errors in WPF butalsoin loadforecastandthe possibilityof unplannedoutagesarecovered. Our results show, however, thatanadaptivestrategyto deﬁneadequatereserves should beput in place,becauseWPF errors varyimportantlyfrom hour to hour. Our results alsoshow thata probabilisticwind power forecastcanbeused to deﬁnemore adequatereserve requirements. In addition,the exampleshows thatthe desired level of reserves is more likely to beachieved with astochasticUC formulationthatexplicitly takesinto accountthe varyinguncertaintyin wind power predictions. One of the majorcontributionsof this chapteris to adoptscenarioswith temporalcorrelationof the errors within eachscenariowhen appliedto the UC problem.Most approachespublishedto datehavebeenusing Gaussianrepresentationsof WPF uncertaintythat are in the form of marginaldistributions, which do not represent time dependency treatmentthatresults in gross approximations,becausethe UC problemalsohasastrong time- dependency component in its deﬁnition(ramping,shut-down/start-updecisions, and,if hydro power is present, the use of water).A stochasticUC formulationwith representativescenariosis clearlybetter,becauseit canhandlethe temporalcorrelationin forecastingerrors asopposed to explicit reserve requirements. 13 An exception is the WILMAR model, which does not use aGaussianrepresentationof WPF uncertainly,butuses anapproachtakingthe temporalcorrelationsof the forecasterrors into account[66]. 52 In conclusion, the chapter sustains that system operators may move with conﬁdenceto the adoptionof probabilistic(stochastic)decision methods in order to reduce costs andrisks. In fact, the adoptionof a“blind”ﬁxedcriterion for the reserve tells nothing aboutthe credibilityof its assumptionsor aboutthe risks. It mayhappenthatin some instances,aﬁxedreserve valuemay approximatethe results from astochasticdecision process — however, one cannever becertain aboutthis beforehand.In the presence of the largeandunavoidablewind power prediction errors, especiallyin thermal-dominatedpower systems, stochasticapproachesshould prove to bemore useful. A ﬁrststep would beto move towardthe use of adaptivereserve requirements, which are a function of the wind power forecast. Next, operators can deploy an entirely stochastic approach,in which the wind power forecast uncertainty is fully represented in the UC formulation. 53 This pageintentionallyblank 54 5 REPRESENTATIVE wmo POWER SCENARIOS AND THEIR PROBABILITIES FOR STOCHASTIC MODELS“ This chapteranalyzesthe applicationof clustering techniques for wind power scenarioreduction. The results show the unimodalstructure of scenariosgeneratedunder aMonte Carloprocess. The unimodalstructure hasbeenconﬁrmedbythe modes found bythe informationtheoretic learning Mean Shift algorithm. The chapter also presents a new technique that is ableto represent the WPF uncertaintybyaset of representativescenarioscapableof characterizingthe probabilitydensity function of the wind power forecast. From aninitiallargeset of sampled scenarios, areduced discrete set of representative scenarios associatedwith aprobabilityof occurrence canbecreatedﬁndingthe areasof high-probabilitydensity. This discrete set will allowthe reduction of the computationalburden in stochastic models thatrequire scenario representation,such asthe stochasticUC models presented in Chapter4. 5.1 Introduction The continuous increaseof wind power penetrationis introducing more variabilityandmore volatilityin electricity generation.This challengesthe managementandplanningof the electric power system. To cope with uncertainwind power production, efforts areconstantlyinvested in developing more accuratewind power forecasts.A common form of delivering the wind power forecastis calledpoint forecastandrepresents asingle valuefor eachlook-aheadtime horizon. However, no forecast canbeperfect. When the forecast is delivered as apoint forecast, it commonly containsonly the conditionalexpectationateachtime step. However, anexpectation cannothelp in calculatingrisks or the conditionalvaluesatrisk: one needs adescription of the probabilitydensity function (pdf). The power industry is in need of estimatesof forecastinguncertainty,besidesthe point forecasts. The most common description hasbeenin the form of marginaldistributionsfor eachtime step. The presentationof these results, usually,is done in the form of intervalsor quantiles,butthis is asomewhatmisleadingform of presentation,becauseit gives the illusion of “trajectories”or time sequences. However, ateachtime step whatone hasis amarginaldistribution,regardlessof what happened in the previous time steps — the time dependency is absentfrom the interval/quantilerepresentation. However, for some applications,one cannot neglect time dependencies: it is the case, for instance,of UC decisions to bemadebysystem operators.Becauseof technicalconstraints,such asrampinglimits or minimum shutdown andstart-uptimes, andbecauseof the natureof costs, the decisions to bemadealsoinvolve time dependencies. The traditionalpracticecallsfor deterministic models to beused bysystem operatorsin the decision-makingprocess. This wasacceptablewhen the uncertaintieswere of limited amplitude, such as in load forecasting. However, wind generation uncertainty tends typically to be signiﬁcantlygreaterthanloadforecastinguncertainty.Hence, the description of uncertaintymust beincorporatedin the models. 14 This chapteris reproduced from Proceedings 16’11Int. Conference on Intelligent System Applicationon Power Systems (ISAP), J. Sumaili,H. Keko, V. Miranda,Z. Zhou, A. Botterud, J. Wang,“FindingRepresentativeWind Power Scenariosandtheir Probabilitiesfor StochasticModels,”Greece, Sept. 2011, with permission from IEEE. 55 Becausethe decision models areusuallybasedon mathematicalprogrammingapproaches,the logicalwayto include uncertaintyin amultiple time step optimizationprocess is to adopt stochastic programmingmodels. These models usuallywork with scenarios associatedwith probabilities.In the caseof WPF, ascenariois atime series or aparticularsequence of values representing an assumedpossiblerealizationof wind power along some period. A thorough description of wind power uncertaintywould bebyaprobabilitydensity function in aspaceof multiple dimensions (the numberof time steps within the prediction horizon). An approximate representationof this pdf canbeobtainedwith aset of scenarios,sampledfrom the probability density function representing the historical(observed)error distribution.While this method is favorablesince it is ableto carrythe informationon the temporaldevelopment of uncertainty,the primarydrawbackof the scenariorepresentationis its implied computationalburden: ahigh numberof scenariosis needed to accuratelyrepresent the associateduncertainty.This meansthat the decision makinginvolving stochasticoptimizationmaytur11 prohibitivelyhardfor such a largeset of scenarios. In this chapter, we analyzea technique of representing the wind power forecast related uncertaintywith areduced set of scenarios.The development of areduced scenarioset is based on clustering methods. Within the process of reducing the initiallargeset of scenarios,the newly obtainedscenariosarealsoassociatedwith the probabilityrelatedto the cluster it represents. The newly obtainedset of representativescenarioscould then beappliedto computationallyheavy problems. The proposed methodology assumes departing from a large set of wind power scenarios generatedusing aMonte Carlosamplingbasedmethod. Eachscenariois actuallyaMonte Carlo sampleor apoint in aspacewhose dimension is equalto the numberof time steps considered. This largeset of scenariosshould beasuitableapproximationof the probabilitydensity function of wind power. One of the possibleapproachesto generatethese scenariosis presented in [78]. The high-density areasaresubstitutedbyasingle representativeor focalscenario. Departing from the reasoningthatthe initialsamplesaresampledbyusing aMonte Carloprocess, the relative weight of each high-density areawith regard to all of the samples becomes the probabilityof the representativescenariosrepresenting thatarea. In this work, the scenariossampledbyusing the process describedin [78] areanalyzedandthe structure of such scenariosis shown to beunimodal,bymeansof using the informationtheoretic learning(ITL) MeanShift algorithm[86], [87]. The goal of the presented work is to ﬁndan adequaterepresentation of the shape of the probabilitydensity function byusing areduced set of scenarioswith assignedprobabilities. Having the assigned probabilitiesmakes the proposed reduction method adequatefor risk assessment. The scenarioreduction topics from the literaturecommonly use the scenariotree construction method from [88], [89]. This work insteaduses aclustering approachwithout assuminganyparticulartemporaldevelopment characteristicof errors. Given aset of initial scenarios,the reduction level is only determined bythe toleranceadmitted. 56 Depending on the particularpower system characteristics,the wind forecastuncertaintymay carry largehedging costs. The reduced set of scenarios obtainedbyclustering is adiscrete representationof the probabilitydensity function using asmallerweighted set of wind power scenarios.Such asmallerset of scenariosmayincreasethe feasibilityof using risk assessment models in apracticalsetting, which is favorablefor managingthe hedging costs. This chapterdescribesthe detailsof the model developed andpresents the results for three DA forecastedwind power scenarios,in astudy casebuiltwith realisticdata.The use of scenario reduction methods for stochasticUC is further explored in Chapter6. 5.2 ScenarioGenerationandthe Need for ScenarioReduction The initialsets of scenariosused refer to DA wind power forecastsin 2006 for ahypothetical wind farmlocatedin the stateof Illinois. Time series of DA deterministic point forecastswere obtainedfrom the EasternWind IntegrationandTransmissionStudy [83]. To produce wind power scenarios,wind power data(forecastedandrealized)were used to train the uncertaintyestimationmodel, aswell asto generatescenariosfor the forecastedwind power, accordingto the methodology introduced byPinson et al.[78], which is equivalentto producing scenariosunder aMonte Carloprocess. The work presented shows how one canorganizealargeset of scenariosinto asmallset of clusters, basedon aprinciple of maximumdensity; associateeachcluster with anempirical probabilityvalue;andrepresent eachcluster byafocalor representativescenario.This technique allows the organizationof a cumulative distribution of clusters. This permits not only the selection of the most representative equivalents but also keeps a quantitative(probability) evaluationof the coverageof possibilitiesguaranteed— and,of course, of the risk of missing the actualwind power series. 5.3 Wind Power ScenarioClustering andModes Finding 5.3.1 Applicationof ClassicalClustering Techniques to Wind Power Scenarios We applythe classicalpatternclustering techniques in order to identify high-probabilitydensity areascharacterizedbysimilarwind power scenarios. The hierarchicalclustering methods rely on a measure of similarity (for agglomerative clustering), in order to buildup the clusters from the samples.One startswith the lowest level of hierarchywhere eachcluster containsasingle member,thatis, the numberof clusters is equalto the numberof scenariosandmerges (agglomerates)progressively the two most similarclusters [90]. At the very highest level of hierarchy,there is asingle cluster containingallof the data.At the intermediatelevels of hierarchy,acommon behaviorof the hierarchicalclustering methods is to group the samplesinto asingle relativelylargecluster, while the rest of the clusters contain outliers. This behavioris observedfor the wind power scenariosgeneratedaccordingto [78]. On the other hand, the classicK-means algorithm[91] leadsto the separationof the initial scenarioset into different clusters; however, this clustering method maintainsrelativelyhigh dispersion inside the clusters. This is due to the unimodalstructure of the initialscenarioset generatedbythe model [78] behindthe Monte Carlosampling. 57 5.3.2 Modes Finding using the ITL MeanShift Algorithm The hypothesis thatthe initialscenariodistributionproduced bythe technique proposed in [78] is unimodalis conﬁrmedbyusing the ITL MeanShift algorithm[86], [87]. The MeanShift is a nonparametric,mode-ﬁndingmethod thatrelies on akernel-basedconstruction of the search spacesurface. The mode-ﬁndingmethod wasappliedto conﬁrmthatthe actualdistributionrepresented bythe initialset of scenariosis unimodal,which seems to present adifﬁcultyfor the classicclustering methods, asdiscussed in the previous subsection.When the MeanShift algorithmis appliedto a single-daydataset, it ﬁndsjust asingle mode, conﬁrmingthe hypothesis. A test of the abilityof the ITL MeanShift algorithmto dealwith multimodalwind scenario distributionswasdesigned, aswell. A totalof 1,000 scenariosfrom three different days(Fig. 5-1 through Fig. 5-3) were used asthe input dataset, totaling3,000 scenarios.Eachof the separate daysshould haveasingle mode, andthe three-daydataset, when merged together asif it were a single day,should then bethree-modal.

The ITL MeanShift algorithmwassuccessful in ﬁndingthe three modes in the merged scenario set resulting from joining the three daysinto asingle set. Eachmode is represented byathick line, andit represents the three mainevolutionarytrends present in the globalscenarioset. This property maysuggest thatthe ITL MeanShift algorithmcanbeused effectively when the set of scenariosis produced from ensemblesandmerged — the informationis not lost andcanbe recovered. 5.4 New Methodology Given aset of M wind power scenariossampledaccordingto some probabilitydensity function describingthe uncertaintyin forecasts,the aimof the reduction process is to merge scenarios presenting high similarityin order to produce anew reduced set, containingthe representative scenariosonly. Eachset of merged scenariosforms acluster andis associatedto acertainfrequency within the sample— its representativeor focalscenariois therefore associatedwith the sameprobability value. Let us denote the forecastedwind power asaseries: pr’= rp1<\"‘>. p1““>1. <5-1) for time horizon t = 1, , T in scenariom = 1, , M. This is alsoapoint in aspaceof dimension T. The forecastedwind power scenariosp11“)arenormalizedwith respect to the installedpower of the wind farm(or generator)in order to obtainthe vectors x(1111, whose components lie in the 60 range [0, 1]. Alternatively,this rangecanbechangedto [0, 100] if the forecastedpower is expressed asapercentageof the installedpower. Different metrics canbeused to deﬁnethe distancebetweentwo scenariosx11) andx111 . For the work presented in this paper,the maximumdeviationhasbeenused: dm,,(X“lXU))==1naX,\"x§)-x§)\",r==1”,T (5-2) where x111 andx111 arethe two scenariosthatarebeingcompared,andT is their dimension. The reduction procedure beginswith anextremely largeset of wind power scenarios,andthen one ﬁndsthe scenario presenting the highest number of neighbors according to a deﬁned tolerance s. Two scenarios x111 andx111 are considered to beneighborsif the following is satisﬁed: ¢m4¢°u@)§@ (am The identiﬁedscenarioalongwith its neighborsarethen cut from the initialset andgrouped in a cluster. The process is repeatedwith the remainingpartuntil the scenariosdo not have any neighborwithin the deﬁnedtolerance.In this way,aset of clusters is deﬁned.Eachof them is associatedwith afocalelement together with aprobabilityvalue. For this method, it is necessaryto deﬁneatolerancefor the scenarioaggregationprocess. The valueof this toleranceis atrade-offbetweenaccuracyandset reduction capability,which is relatedto the computationaleffort. After identifying acluster andits members,the attractingscenariois takenasthe representative or focalscenarioof the cluster andreplacesthe cluster asacondensed discrete representation. Another option is to calculatethe meanvalueof the cluster to obtainthe centroid of the cluster. This scenariois thus produced byaveragingthe cluster members.A third option is to applythe ITL MeanShift algorithmto ﬁndthe mode within the cluster. In these lattercases(averageor mode), the result is usuallynot anexisting scenario. One should be careful in choosing the options for calculatingthe representative scenario. Averagingthe membersof the cluster mayartiﬁciallyintroduce smoothing effects in the new “artiﬁcial”scenario. This “average”scenario would not have been generatedbythe initial scenario-generationprocess, so its behaviormaynot bein line with the originalprobabilistic model thatcapturedthe predicted behaviorof the wind power. On the other hand, if a cluster member is chosen as the representative scenario, therefore becomingthe focalelement, the totalexpected valuemaydeviatefrom the expected valueof the whole set of scenarios.The preferred method for the focalscenariocalculationthus depends on the purpose of the scenarioreduction. Eachfocalscenariois then associatedwith aprobabilityvalue,calculatedasthe ratiobetween the numberof scenariosin the cluster it represents andthe totalnumberof scenarios.Finally, afterchoosing the representativescenariosandcalculatingthe corresponding probabilities,the 6] 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 20 40 60 80 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 20 40 60 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 continuous probabilitydensity function of wind power initiallyrepresented byalargediscrete samplebecomesrepresented byamuch smallerdiscrete set of focal scenarios, eachwith a probabilityvalueassigned. 5.5 Results The methodology describedabovewasappliedto the sets of 1,000 scenariosfor the three days illustratedin Fig. 5-1 through Fig. 5-3 in Section 5.3.2.

The most convenient wayto represent this uncertaintyis byaset of scenarios. A discrete approximationof the probabilitydensity function representing the uncertaintyin WPF maybeprovided by asamplingprocedure of the Monte Carlo type. However, to have an accuraterepresentationof the probabilitydensity function covering allof the forecastingspace, anextremely largeset of elementaryscenariosis needed. But the size of this set is usually incompatiblewith the computationalcomplexity of stochasticprogrammingalgorithms,which aretime demandingandrequire high computationaleffort. The methodology proposed in this papercansubstitutealargescenarioset byasmallerset of clusters, eachone beingreplacedbyarepresentativescenarioassociatedwith the probabilityof the cluster it represents. The reduction capabilitydepends on the admittedtolerance,the distancemetric used to deﬁne the clusters, andthe scenariodispersion. The choice of the metric andthe admissibletolerance hasto bedeﬁnedin accordancewith the problemfor which the scenarioreduction is beingmade andthe level of accuracyneeded for the results. The method not only produces aset of focalor representativescenarios,butalsoorders them by probabilityvalue.This allowsretainingaselected numberof scenariosandunderstandingthe risk of missing anadequaterepresentationfor truncatingthe scenarioset. It alsoallowsone to choose the necessarynumberof scenariosin order to satisfyamaximumlevel of risk. This work, therefore, is acontributionto facilitatingthe adoptionof stochastic optimization models in operationplanning,amove thatis seen asnecessaryto embedthe uncertaintyin WPF in the system operators’decision-makingprocesses.

In particular,we compare different probabilisticforecasting and scenarioreduction methods, andtest the resulting forecastson the stochasticUC model presented in the Chapter4. The results arecomparedto deterministic UC, where dynamicoperatingreserve requirements can alsobe derived from the probabilisticforecasts. In bothcases, the use of probabilisticforecasts contributes to improve the system performance in terms of cost and reliability. 6.1 Introduction The increasingpenetrationof wind power andother renewablesareposing new challengesto power system operatorsin grid managementandgenerationscheduling. The inherent uncertainty and variabilityfrom wind power calls for new approachesto the traditionalUC and ED problems.StochasticUC hasbeenproposed asone approachto betterhandlethe wind power uncertaintyin marketoperations[55]—[58] and[66]—[68],[70]. Furthermore, new approachesto calculatingoperating reserve requirements under wind power uncertainty have also been proposed (e.g., basedon assumed normal distributions of WPF errors [29][48], or on a probabilisticwind power forecast[75]). It is obviousthatWPF canprovide importantinputs to the operationaldecisions of the system operator.However, probabilisticWPF is still arelatively new areaof research, andthere is limited experience in the use of such forecastsin system operationsso far. In order to investigate the consequences of using different UC strategies and reserve requirements in the operationof the electricity market, we have developed a stochastic UC model [60][86] aspresented in Chapter4. The stochasticmodel detemiines the commitment of thermal generating units by minimizing the expected cost over a set of WPF scenarios. Altematively, quantiles from probabilisticWPF canbeused to determine operatingreserve requirements in adeterministic UC. In either case,the qualityof the probabilisticforecastsis clearlyof majorimportancefor the cost effectiveness andreliabilityof the resulting scheduling anddispatch. In this chapter,we use the model to analyzethe scheduling of energy andoperatingreserves under wind power uncertainty.We comparedifferent statisticalmethods for the generationof probabilisticforecasts and also compare two different scenario reduction approaches. Furthermore, we comparethe use of stochasticanddeterministic UC strategiesandoperating reserves requirements. The maincontributionof the chapteris in the systematic analysisof probabilisticWPF methods andtheir potentialuse in power system operations.The results and recommendationsarehighly relevantfor ongoing efforts to improve the managementof wind power uncertaintyandvariabilityin electricity markets. 15 This chapteris basedon Proceedings IEEE Trondheim PowerTech 2011, A. Botterud, Z. Zhou, J. Wang, J. Valenzuela,J. Sumaili, R.J. Bessa, H. Keko, V. Miranda,“UnitCommitment and Operating Reserves with ProbabilisticWind Power Forecasts,”Trondheim, Norway,June 2011, with permission from IEEE. 67 The chapterhasthe following structure: We provide abriefoverview of the UC/ED model used in this chapter in Section 6.2. In Sections 6.3 and 6.4, we describe different approachesto probabilisticWPF andscenarioreduction. Then, in Section 6.5 we comparethe use of different forecastsandoperationalstrategiesin acasestudy of atest system with wind power andthermal generation.Finally,we summarizeour ﬁndings,drawconclusions, andpoint out directions for future work. 6.2 Scheduling of Energy andOperatingReserves We use the model ﬁrstfrom the previous chapterto analyzethe scheduling of energy and operatingreserves in the electricity market.“As areminder, the objectiveof the UC model can beexpressed as: Min2 prob,- [Fc,§,+ C(RNS,§) + c(EIvs§)]] +2 sc,_, (6-1) s ti t iI I The ﬁrstcomponent corresponds to minimizing the expected sum of fuel costs from thermal generators (FC), the cost of unserved reserve (C(RNS)), and the cost of unserved energy (C(ENS)) over aset of scenarios (s). The lastpart of the objective function is the thermal generatorstart-upcosts (SC). The problemis assumedto haveanhourly time resolution andis solved for the next day.Two importantconstraintsareto meet the demandfor loadandoperating reserves (OR) in alltime periods (t) andscenarios(s): Z gen§hermal,i,t+ gen;/ind,t : loadt_ ENS?’ V ti S i Z 0Ttsher\"mal,i,t 2 0R1\"e_g,t + OR;/ind,t 4 RNSEI V t'5 i Both thermalgenerationandwind power contributeto meet the load,butwe assumethatonly thennal generationcanmeet the operatingreserve. We only consider one type of operating reserves: spinning reserves, which areprovided bycommitted thermalunits.”However, we differentiatebetweenreserve requirements to meet uncertaintyin thermalgenerationandload (0R,@g) andwind power uncertainty(ORW,-M). If there arescenarioswith scarcitywhere operating reserves or loadarenot beingserved, this is penalizedin the objectivefunction. The traditional UC constraints are also included, such as rampingconstraints and minimum-up and -down constraints.Note thatthe model becomesdeterministic simply byassumingthatthere is only one scenario. 1° Some changeshavebeenmadeto the model to improve the run-time. First, animproved representationof the binarycommitment variablesfor thermalunits hasbeenimplemented basedon [92]. Second, the model is now implemented in AMPL anduses the state-of-the-artsolver CPLEX for the resulting mixed integer linear(MIP) and linear(LP) programmingproblems. 17 This assumption is obviously asimpliﬁcation.For adiscussion of different categories of operatingreserve requirements, we refer to [76]. 68 In this analysis,we focus on the impactof wind power uncertainty.We assumethatcommitment decisions aremadebasedon aDA wind power forecast.Then, we calculatethe resulting RT dispatch with the realized wind power generation.“The system’sabilityto handle RT ﬂuctuationin wind power will depend on boththe UC strategyandthe operatingreserve policy. UC schedules the generating units over the next day, taking inter-temporal constraints into account.Operatingreserves impose additionalconstraintson unit availabilityfor eachindividual hour. The wind power uncertainty canbe accommodatedbyusing astochastic UC, which considers arangeof scenariosfor wind power generationfor the next day. The wind power scenarioscanbegeneratedfrom probabilisticWPF. If the scenariosgive agood representationof the wind power uncertainty,it should not benecessaryto impose anadditionaloperatingreserve for wind, ORM-,,.1. Altematively,adeterministic UC model could beused to handlethe wind power uncertaintythrough the additionalreserve requirement. In this case, ORW,~,,d could be derived from probabilisticWPF. With the ﬁrstapproach,additionalreserves areimplicitly added through the stochasticUC, asopposed to the second approach,which uses anexplicit reserve requirement for wind power. In either case,the performanceof the scheduling decisions would depend on the qualityof the probabilisticforecast.The different operatingstrategiesareexplored in the casestudy in Section 6.5. 6.3 ProbabilisticWind Power Forecasts There are three mainmethods for estimatingWPF uncertainty: (1) the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) point forecast approach,where the wind power uncertainty is directly computed from the NWP point forecast for weather; (2) the power output point forecast approach,which consists of forecastinguncertaintybasedon the historicalWPF errors; and (3) the NWP ensembleapproach,where NWP ensemblesareused asinput to the generationof probabilisticpower forecasts. For a detailed discussion of state-of-the art in WPF and probabilisticforecasts,we refer to [1]. In our research,we arefocusing on the statisticalalgorithmsused in probabilisticWPF methods (1) and(2) above.A common approachis to use quantileregression (QR) to estimatethe WPF uncertaintyin terms of set of forecastquantiles[77]. In the project, we havedeveloped novel statisticaluncertaintyforecastingapproachesusing kernel density forecasts(KDFs). Two new KDF-basedWPF methods basedon the Nadaraya-Watson(NW) and Quantile-Copula(QC) estimatorsareproposed in [93], [94], and[95]. KDF methods arebasedon conditional density estimation,which consists of estimatingthe density of arandomvariable,Y, knowing thatthe explanatoryrandomvariable,X, is equalto x. For the wind power problem,this consists of forecastingthe wind power probabilitydensity function (pdf) attime step t for eachlook-aheadtime step t+k of agiven time-horizon when knowing aset of explanatoryvariables(e.g., NWP variablesandmeasuredwind power output). Mathematically,this set of conditions canbeformulatedas: 18 Note thatwe do not consider the possibilityof changingcommitment decisions betweenDA scheduling andreal- time dispatch.Intra-daycommitment would clearlyaddﬂexibilityto operationaldecisions. However, we focus on the impactof different UC andoperatingreserve strategiesanddo not consider the additionalﬂexibilityfrom intra- daycommitments. 69 jP(pz+k I X = xz+kIt) = fx xt+k|t where p,+k is the wind power forecasted for look-aheadtime t+k, x,+;,I, are the explanatory variablesforecastedfor look-aheadtime step t+k andavailableattime step t, ﬁ>,X(p,+;,,x,+k|,)is the multivariatedensity function, andfX(x,+k|,) is the marginaldensity of X. The nonparametric conditionaldensity estimation[96] for (6-4) is asfollows: t(p|X=X)=2Ki,,(P—R)-M (6-5) g:KhX(x—X,) where the kernel bandwidthhp controls the smoothness of eachconditionaldensity in the p direction, while hx controls the smoothness betweenconditionaldensities in the x direction. The output is apdf for wind power generationfor eachlook-aheadtime step of aspeciﬁctime horizon. The pdf is general, from which several uncertaintyrepresentations canbe derived (e.g., standarddeviation, quantiles). For details on the implementation of the KDF WPF methods, we refer to [93], [94], and[95]. The forecastedpdfs for eachlook-aheadtime step are the input of the scenario generation method described in Section 6.4. In the case study in Section 6.5, we comparethe use of probabilisticforecastsfrom splines QR andKDF basedon the NW estimator. 6.4 ScenarioGenerationandReduction The probabilisticforecastsdescribedaboveexpress uncertaintyinformationfor speciﬁcpoints in time. However, in the UC problem,it is importantto takeinter-temporalrelationshipsin the forecastuncertaintyinto account.This makesscenariosamore appropriaterepresentationof the uncertainty.We use the WPF scenariogenerationapproachdescribedin [78] to convert quantiles or pdfs to forecastscenarios.In this approach,scenariosamplingis performed using aMonte Carloapproach.A covariancematrixis estimatedbasedon historicalforecastingerrors, andthis is used to represent inter-temporal(hour-to-hour) correlations. We canonly use alimited numberof scenariosasinput to the stochasticUC model becauseof the computationalcomplexity of the problem.In most cases,there will beaneed for scenario reduction. In this chapter,we aretesting different methods to generateareduced set of scenarios. One simple approachis to select arandomsubsetof the originalscenarios.In the casestudy below,this approachis referred to as scenarioreduction method 1 (SR1). Within the power systems domain,it is common to use the scenarioreduction method from [89], which we refer to as SR2. Here, areduced scenario set is derived from the Kantorovichdistancebetweenthe originalandreduced set of scenarios, taking scenarioprobabilitiesanddistancesof scenario valuesinto account. 70 We are also exploring alternativeapproachesto generate a reduced set of representative scenarios, as outlined in Chapter 5. The ideain Chapter 5 and in [97] is to ﬁndthe most attractivescenariothathasahigher numberof neighborsaccordingto aﬂexibledistancemetric, which is selected to becompatiblewith the problemto besolved. For the stochasticUC problem, we use the maximumabsolutedeviationdistance: d(i,j) = max||X§‘>-X§”||, t = 1, ...,T (6-6) where X (I) andX U) arethe two scenariosbeingcompared,andT is their dimension. The two scenarios are considered to be “neighbors”if the distance betweenthem is lower thanthe admissibletolerance, that is, d(i, j) £ e. When the more attractivescenario and all its “neighbors”arefound, they arecut from the initialset of scenarios,therebyforming acluster. The procedure is repeated until the attractivescenario cannot ﬁnda neighbor within the tolerance.The remainingscenarioswithout aneighborareconsidered outliers. Startingfrom a smalltolerancevalue,the totalnumberof clusters maybehigher thanthe desired numberof scenariosset for the stochasticproblem.The algorithmis then repeatedwith alower s in order to ﬁndthe admissibletolerancethatprovides the desired numberof clusters. Finally,eachcluster is represented byits more representativescenario.Here, the scenariopresenting the lower sum of distances,accordingto (6-6), with respect to allother membersof the cluster hasbeenused. The probabilityassociatedwith eachrepresentativescenariois given bythe sum of the probabilities of its cluster components. We refer to this method asSR3. 6.5 CaseStudy The purpose of the casestudy is to test the different probabilisticWPF approaches,scenario reduction methods, andoperating strategies on DA UC decisions andthe resulting RT ED. Thermal units are committed basedon aDA wind power forecast by using stochastic or deterministic UC. The RT ED is then solved with the realizedavailabilityof wind power. We focus solely on the impactof WPF uncertainty.Other uncertainties,like generatoroutagesand loadforecasterrors, aretherefore omitted. We ﬁrstdiscuss the qualityof the probabilisticwind power forecastsandresulting wind power scenarios.Then, we examinethe impacton UC and ED results in asimple casestudy with wind power and10 thermalunits. 6.5.1 ProbabilisticWind Power Forecasts Time series of the DA deterministic point forecasts and realized wind power output for 15 hypotheticallocationsin Illinois in 2006 were aggregatedandused asthe startingpoint for the probabilisticforecasts. The datawere obtainedfrom the Eastern Wind Integration and TransmissionStudy (EWITS) [83]. We use bothQR andNW KDF to generateprobabilisticwind power forecasts.The wind power point forecastis used asthe only explanatoryvariablein bothcases.The period from Januaryto July is used to trainthe two statisticalmodels, whereasthe resulting forecastdatafor Octoberto Decemberareused in the analysis.An exampleof aquantileforecastis shown in Fig. 6-1. In order to evaluatethe outputs from the two different forecast uncertainty estimation procedures, we focused on the calibrationforecasts.Calibrationis ameasureof how well the forecastedquantilesmatchthe observedvalues[1]. Fig. 6-2 depicts the calibrationdiagramfor 7] the QR andNW methods. There is clearlyaquite signiﬁcantnegativedeviation(corresponding to anover-forecast)for bothmethods, with QR havingthe largestdeviation.19We provide a more detailedcomparisonof different probabilisticWPF methods in [93], [94], and[95]. The results indicatethatKDF forecastsoutperform QR in terms of calibration,whereasQR tends to perform betterin terms of sharpness,which is ameasureof the width of the forecastdistribution. 1 0.9 - 0.8 - -'- O.7\" ' 0.6 - ;' 0.5 -— — — 04 -— ~~ — 4-\" // '4 013 4 - \\ 4 -1;-; T 0.2 \\ f / 0.1 - }4\\ ~ ,— 0 _ ,, I11 p.u WndPower O 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011121314l5l6l7l8l920212223 Time[hour] Fig. 6-1 Probabilisticforecasts of wind power quantiles (5%, 10%, 95%) basedon QR and realizedwind power generation(dotted line) for day1. 0.0 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 4045 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 -2.0 - ___ I ‘on% -4.0 - - \\ i QR ._ \\ Devat ' \\ 1 1 \\ \" \\ -8.0 \"r ’\\ _ -10.0 NominalProportion Rate[%] Fig. 6-2 Calibrationdiagramfor QR andNW methods, Oct.—Dec. 2006. Based on the probabilisticQR and NW forecasts, we generated 1,000 scenarios with the samplingmethod describedin [78]. Scenarioreduction is then used to reduce the fI1ll set to either 10 or 100 scenariosbyusing the three scenarioreduction methods describedin Section 6.4. For SR2, we use the implementationin GAMS/SCENRED [98] with standardparameters.The SR3 method is implemented in Matlab. 19 The largedeviationsmayhaveto do with the short evaluationperiod. 72 Fig. 6-3 shows thatthe averagesof the reduced scenariosareclose to the averageof the original 1,000 scenarios,althoughsome deviationscanbeseen with randomselection (SR1) andfor the clustering-basedscenarioreduction method (SR3). Results in Fig. 6-4 andFig. 6-5 show thatthe reduced scenariosbasedon SR2 andSR3 tend to haveasigniﬁcantlylower variancethanthe original 1,000 scenarios. The varianceof the randomlyselected scenarios(SR1) is higher on averagethanfor SR2 andSR3, andwith 100 scenarios,this method yields acloser matchto the varianceof the originalscenarios. Table6-1 shows acomparisonof the meansandvariancesfor the originalandreduced scenarios. The statistics are calculatedfrom the hourly forecasted scenario dataover the full 3-month period. All of the reduced sets areclose to the originalscenariosin terms of the overallaverage over the period. However, SR2 has alower meanabsoluteerror (MAE) thanthe other two methods. When it comes to variance,SR1 provides acloser ﬁtthanSR2 andSR3 do, bothin terms of averageandMAE. It is evident thatbothSR2 andSR3 result in asigniﬁcantreduction in the scenario variancecompared to the original scenario set. Still, the ﬁtimproves by increasingthe size of the reduced scenarioset from 10 to 100. Further analysisof statisticalproperties could beperformed byanalyzingadditionalmoments of the scenariodistributions.A comparisonof scenarioreduction [89] andmoment matching[99] approachesfor scenariotree construction is conducted in [100]. The authors found thatthe moment-matchingapproachyields abetterﬁtcomparedto the originalscenarioset in terms of mean, variance,skewness, and kurtosis. However, the scenario reduction provides better correspondence in terms of autocorrelation.Scenario reduction is also considerablyfaster computationallythanis moment matching.The authorsalsotested the two approachesasinput to ascheduling model for the electricity marketwithin aregion of Germanyandfound thatscenario trees derived from moment matchingyields the lowest operationalcost [100]. 0.9 — 0.8 - , 3 '4 0-7 /-v O.6 - ,' ' 0_5 - U ° ' ' ' \" Realized |—| |_| Forecastpu 0 _’ 0_4 _ ‘ 0: I 1000 '.'\\1 -' ——— 10—SR10.3 \\ ' I O2 _ \\.\\_4‘ I M i10-SR2 Power .I..l A _ - — - - 10-SR30.1 .7 _, 0 1 4 7 1013161922252s313437404346 Time[hour] Fig. 6-3 Averagesof 10 scenarioswith reduction methods SR1, SR2, andSR3 ascomparedto the averageof the original1,000 scenarios,QR, days1 and2. 73 nce[p.u. oVara Scenar Fig. 6-4 Variancesfor 10 scenarioswith reduction methods SR1, SR2, andSR3 ascomparedto the 0.035 0.03 O .025 0.02 0.015 0.01 0.005 0 :::=I— —=.E:-I Q‘_:::'I.:.s- 4 \\ .__$_ .,_-5 ,_,.-.-1I\\- _.§_:.__,_.e-':..'4'4I: I I r‘ 1000' W ——— 10-SR1 \\ M i 10-SR2 - - - 10-SR3 1 4 7 1013 16 1922 25 28313437404346 Time [hour] averageof the original1,000 scenarios,QR, days1 and2. 0.025 ScenaroVarance[p.u.] Fig. 6-5 Variancesfor 100 scenarioswith reduction methods SR1, SR2, andSR3 ascomparedto 0.02 - 0.015 - 0.01 '\\ 0.005 \" D, \\. \\[41 f Q I -I |. 11 -~ ¢’€ in \\__ ?--4e-1~ -s \\‘~¢$-.,. __>rin- 44'_<‘?:_-19 _rca’\\' ’. 0 '7 <44\"’ i? \\ | 1000 1E - - - - 100-SR1i 100-SR251 \\ _,' 1.7 — - - 100-SR3'“.

The system consists of ten thermalgeneratorswith amix of base,intermediate,and peakunits. The characteristicsof the units arethe sameasin Chapter4 (Table4-1). A time series with 91 days(October—December)of datafor loadsandwind power were simulated.The load dataare basedon scaled historical load proﬁles for Illinois from 2006 and therefore are synchronized with the wind power data.The totalinstalledcapacityis 1,662 MW of thermal power and500 MW of wind power, andthe peakloadis 1,500 MW. The totalwind energy amountsto 20% of the loadwithin the 91-daysimulationperiod. The costs of unserved reserve and load are assumed to be $1,100/MWh and $3,500/MWh, respectively. These costs are included in the objectivefunction of the UC problem,asshown in (6-1). An overview of the simulatedcasesis provided in Table6-2 andTable6-3. The casesdiffer in terms of which UC strategy,operatingreserve requirements, wind power forecast,andscenario reduction method is employed. For the deterministic cases (Table6-2), the ﬁrstcaseuses a perfect forecastandtherefore serves asabenchmarkfor the analysis.The PF-QR andPF-NW casesuse deterministic forecasts(i.e., the 50% quantilefrom either the QR or NW forecasts), without additionaloperatingreserve for wind uncertainty,OR.,.,-mi. In RF-QR andRF-NW, we addaﬁxedORWW1 equalto the averagedifference of the 50% and5% WPF quantiles.Finally,in the RD-QR andRD-NW cases, ORW,~,,d is dynamic, updated each day, and set equal to the difference betweenthe 50% and5% quantiles.Becausethe 50% quantileis used asthe point forecast,the demandsfor energy andregularoperatingreserves should bemet with aprobability of 0.95. The optimal choice of quantile range for ORWW; generally depends on the cost of scheduling additionalreserves compared to the cost of not meeting the regular reserve requirements. It should benoted thatamore rigorous approachcould beused to derive ORWW1 (e.g., basedon the ideasin [75]). For the stochasticcases,we varythe probabilisticWPF approach,the scenarioreduction method, andthe numberof scenarios,asshown in Table6-3. ORW,-WI is set to zero for the stochasticcases, with the assumption that the stochastic UC strategy intemally addresses the wind power uncertainty. Table6-2 Simulatedcaseswith deterministic UC.

For deterministic cases,adynamicreserve requirement basedon the probabilisticforecast performs betterthanaﬁxedadditionalreserve. A dynamicreserve basedon aNW forecastperfomis betterthanadynamicreserve based on QR forecast,possiblycausedbythe bettercalibrationof the NW forecast(Fig. 6-2). With stochasticUC, scenariosbasedon NW forecastsperform betterthanscenariosfrom QR. Formalscenarioreduction basedon SR2 andSR3 does not improve the overallsystem performanceunder astochasticUC strategycomparedto arandomselection of scenarios (SR1). This mayhaveto do with the decreasein scenariovarianceunder SR2 andSR3 (Table6-1), which mayresult in less hedging andmore risky scheduling. Increasing the number of scenarios improves the performance of the stochastic UC strategy.However, the computationalburdenincreases.In these cases,the run-time with 100 insteadof 10 scenariosis 15 to 20 times longer. Some additionalreserve is needed alsoin stochasticUC to cover wind power uncertainty not capturedbythe probabilisticforecastsandthe limited numberof scenarios.The best stochastic case (S100-QRl) yields a slightly higher total cost than that of the best detenninistic case(RD-NW). The two best cases (S100-R1 and RD-NW) both make use of probabilisticWPF information. 77 Day-ahead point forecast 4hr-ahead probabilistic forecast Actual wind power Real-time dispatch and price Day-ahead schedule and price 6.7 Current Work: IL CaseStudy In our recent work [101], we are scaling up the UC modeling frameworkto handle larger systems in amore realistic manner. In particular,we are testing different UC models and operatingreserve strategieson two-settlement electricity marketsto explore the potentialuse of probabilisticWPF to help power system operators’scheduling anddispatchdecisions. We are using the power system in Illinois as atest bedto analyzethe implicationsof alarge-scale expansionof wind power in areal-worldelectricity market. The Illinois system consists of thermal generation andwind power, with only anegligible amountof hydro generation.In the casestudy, loadsandthermalgenerationcorresponds to the situationin Illinois in 2006, whereaswe assumethatadditionalwind power is addedto the system to represent afuture scenariowith ahigh penetrationof wind power. The Illinois system in 2006 consisted of 210 thermalplantswith atotalcapacityof 41,380 MW. We assumethatthe totalinstalledcapacityof wind power in the system is 14,000 MW. The wind power generation ﬂuctuatesbetween0 and12,680 MW. Under this assumption,wind power provides 20% of the in-stateloadand16.6% of the totalloadincluding export in the July—Octoberperiod. The hourly loadproﬁleis basedon historicaldatafrom two largeutilities in the stateof Illinois for the months of July to Octoberof 2006. We simulatethe mainsteps in the operationof two-settlement electricity marketswith focus on the use of wind power forecasts(Fig. 6-8). The commitment schedule for themralunits is ﬁrst determined basedon aDA wind power point forecastin the DA market,using detenninistic UC. Then, we simulatethe reliabilityassessmentcommitment (RAC), where the commitment of fast- startingunits is adjustedbasedon a4-hour-aheadprobabilisticforecast, using stochastic or deterministic UC. The RT ED is then solved with the realizedavailabilityof wind power. We focus solely on the impactof WPF uncertainty.Other uncertainties,like generatoroutagesand loadforecasterrors, aretherefore omitted, similarto the 10-unit case study presented above. Note thatthe analysisof the 10-unit caseaboveandin Chapter4 does not consider the RAC, as allcommitment decisions aremadeatthe DA stage.The simulationset-up for the Illinois study is therefore betteralignedwith current operationalpractices,asdiscussed in Chapter3. Commitment Commitment schedule schedule uc .............. H RA¢ Fig. 6-8 Simulationof two settlement electricity marketsin Illinois casestudy. 78 The results from the Illinois casestudy show thatthe re-commitment decisions atthe RAC stage arevery importantfor the cost andreliabilityof the system. We ﬁndthatadditionaloperating reserves arerequired to handlethe uncertaintyin wind power. When basingthe re-commitment decisions on adeterministic UC model, the use of dynamicoperatingreserves derived from the probabilisticforecastgives betterperformancethanﬁxedreserve requirements, asthe operating reserve levels arebetteralignedwith the wind power forecastuncertainty. A stochasticUC model with wind power scenariosleadsto different re-commitment decisions andRT dispatch. However, dynamicoperatingreserves andstochasticUC give similarresults in terms of total system cost. Hence, from aqualitativeperspective, the results from the Illinois casestudy arein line with the 10-unit results presented earlierin this chapter,althoughamore comprehensive modeling frameworkis applied. The detailedresults from the Illinois casealsoillustratethat inaccuratewind power forecastscanleadto over- andunder-commitment of generationcapacity andtherefore havelargeimplicationsfor system reliabilityandRT prices. Further detailson the Illinois casestudy areprovided in [101]. 6.8 Conclusion The results of the analysisin this chapterclearlyillustratethe potentialvalueof probabilistic WPF in power system operations. Such forecastscanbeincorporatedinto adeterministic UC through probabilisticreserve requirements or canprovide scenariosasinput to astochasticUC. Some advantagesof the detemiinistic approachwith dynamicreserves includes thatit is better alignedwith current operatingprocedures. Furthermore, from acomputationalperspective, it is a simpler model with less computationalburden. However, this approachdoes not capturethe effect of inter-temporalrampingevents. It alsodoes not consider uncertaintyandits cost in the objectivefunction. In contrast,stochasticUC does addressinter-temporalvariabilitythrough the scenariorepresentationof uncertainty.Moreover, the totalcost, including the expected cost of scarcity, is explicitly taken into account in the objective function. However, the switch to stochasticUC involves amore radicaldeparturefrom current practice;furthermore, it mayrun into computationalconstraintsin largesystems, andthe beneﬁtsin terms of cost savingsmaybe limited. More work is needed to improve the quality of probabilisticWPF, both in terms of pdf estimationandgenerationof adequatescenarios.However, there will alwaysbeinaccuracyin probabilisticforecasts, just as in point forecasts. This calls into question the overall risk paradigmunder which scheduling decisions aremade.In stochasticUC, with the minimization of expected cost, one could adjustthe risk level bychangingthe costs of unserved energy and reserves in the objectivefunction. However, it mayalsoberequired to consider other approaches basedon different decision paradigms,such asutility theory, valueatrisk, robustoptimization, or regret. The optimaldecision strategydoes not only depend on the risk preferences of the system operator,butalsoon the qualityof the probabilisticforecast. 79 This pageintentionallyblank 80 7 WIND POWER TRADING UNDER UNCERTAINTY IN ELECTRICITY MARKETSZO This chapterpresents anew model for optimaltradingof wind power in DA electricity markets under uncertaintyin wind power andprices. The model considers settlement mechanismsin marketswith locationalmarginalprices (LMPs), where wind power is not necessarilypenalized from deviationsbetweenDA schedule andRT dispatch.We use quantileregression andkemel density estimationto produce aprobabilisticwind power forecast,whereasuncertaintiesin DA andRT prices areassumedto follow anormaldistribution.Utility theory andconditionalvalue atrisk (CVAR) areused to represent the risk preferences of the wind power producers. The model is tested on datafrom ahypothetical wind farmlocatedin the state of Illinois and combinedwith historicalLMP data.The results show thatthe model caneffectively control the trade-offbetweenrisk andreturn for wind power producers operatingin volatile electricity markets.

Our most recent res ts from applyingthe model on areal-worldwind farmlocatedin the Midwest arepresented in [l02]. 8] 7.1 Introduction There has been arapidexpansionof wind energy in recent years, with the globalinstalled capacityof wind power exceeding 200 GW [3]. Wind power is expected to continue its growth in many countries, including the United States [44]. For wind farm owners, it is therefore becomingincreasinglyimportantto managethe risk of participatingin the electricity market.In the United States,most of the wind power is sold under long-term power purchasingagreements (PPAs). The PPAs lock in the price of delivered electricity andtherebystabilizethe revenue stream[103]. Nevertheless, asigniﬁcantshareof wind power is sold directly to the electricity market.In 2009, 38% of the new installedwind power capacitywassold asmerchantgeneration, andmost of this energy wastradedin regions with open accesselectricity markets[103]. For merchantwind generation,it is very importantto applyscheduling andtradingstrategiesthat reﬂectthe uncertaintyin wind power andprices andthe corresponding trade-offbetweenrisk andreturn for the wind farmowner. At the sametime, purchasersof PPAs will haveto schedule the contractedwind power into the electricity market,andconsider how wind power inﬂuences the scheduling strategyof the rest of their portfolio. In this chapter,we discuss scheduling andtradingof wind power with focus on DA electricity markets.We ﬁrstprovide anoverview of existing literatureon this topic. We then discuss the tradingof wind power in U.S. marketswith LMPs, including settlement procedures andtheir inﬂuenceon tradingdecisions. We present anoptimizationmodel, which ﬁndsthe optimalwind power bidunder uncertaintyin forecastsfor wind power, aswell asDA andRT prices. Finally, we applythe model in acase study of ahypotheticalwind farmin the stateof Illinois. We analyzehow DA bids depend on risk preferences anddeviationpenaltyschemes, under the assumptionthatwind power is sold asmerchantgeneration. 7.2 LiteratureReview Tradingof wind power in electricity marketsis still arelativelynew problem.A limited number of methods havebeenproposed in the literatureto addressthe problem, as outlined below. Bathurst et al. [104] use asimple wind power uncertaintyrepresentationbasedon Markov probabilitiesandshow how this approachcanbeused to reduce imbalancecosts from short-term wind power tradingin the UK market.Bremnes [23] demonstrateshow probabilisticwind power forecastscanbecreatedbymeansof localquantileregression. He shows thatif imbalancecosts aredeterministic, the proﬁtmaximizingbidis equalto the c+/(c+ + c-) wind power forecast quantile, where c1 and c- are the imbalancecosts of excess and shortage, respectively. MatevosyanandSoder [19] use anARIMA model for the wind speed andapower curve to produce wind power forecastscenarios.The authorspropose astochasticoptimizationmodel for DA tradingthat considers amore complex imbalancecost scheme akinto the rules in the Scandinavianelectricity market(Nord Pool). Pinson et al. [17] alsofocuses on minimizing the imbalancecost. In acasestudy, the authorsdemonstratethe advantagesof using probabilistic wind power forecaststo derive DA tradingstrategiessimilarto the one proposed in [23]. Bourry et al. [20] use probabilisticwind power forecastsbasedon kernel density estimation(KDE) to estimateaprobabilitydistributionfor the imbalancecost. A risk-baseddecision approachbased on conditional value at risk (CVAR) is used to derive the optimalbidunder the resulting uncertaintyin imbalancecost. UsaolaandMoreno [105] focus on biddingof wind energy in intra-daymarkets.This is framedasaproﬁt-maximizationproblemwith simple representations of uncertaintiesin wind power predictions andprices (intra-dayandbalancing).Moraleset al. 82 [106] propose astochasticprogrammingmodel for wind power tradingin multiple consecutive markets. Uncertaintyin wind power andprices arerepresented as seasonalARIMA models. However, the probabilisticmodels aregeneralandarenot linked to forecastinformation.The authorsderive optimaloffer curves (bid-quantity)using CVAR asameasurefor risk preferences. Finally,Dent et al.[107] derive analyticalwind power biddingstrategiesunder the assumptionof acontinuous probabilityfunction for wind power. The authorsalsoconsider situationswhere the RT price is a function of wind generation and use CVAR to represent risk-averse trading behavior. The mainfeaturesof severalof the wind power models outlined abovearesummarizedin Table 7-1, with acomparisonto the model describedin this chapter. The literature summarizedabovefocus on the conditions in Europeanelectricity markets. In general,these marketshavedifferent prices for positive andnegativeimbalancesin RT [105]. Although there areregionaldifferences in marketrules within Europe, wind power producers are therefore generallypenalizedif their deviationis againstthe system balance.In contrast,our analysisadds new insights by focusing on typical settlement procedures in U.S. electricity marketswith LMPs. In these markets,there is only one RT price. Hence, awind power producer mayactuallybeneﬁtfrom deviatingfrom its advanceschedule, depending on the difference in DA andRT LMPs. We emphasizethe use of probabilisticWPF methods to support trading decisions, andwe use different methods to produce probabilisticforecasts. We alsoconsider uncertaintiesin bothDA andRT prices andtheir impactson the risk facedbywind power producers operatingin LMP markets.Moreover, we consider different approachesto represent risk preferences, either through the expected value (i.e., risk neutral), a CVAR measure (i.e., trade-offbetweenexpected valueandrisk), or with aclassicalutility function. As faraswe know, utility theory hasnot beenused in previous literatureon wind power trading.Finally,our model considers the impactof marketdesign on the optimaltradingdecision. In particular,we analyzehow adeviationpenaltywould inﬂuencethe optimalDA biddingdecision. 7.3 Wind Power in LMP Markets Most U.S. electricity marketsareoperatedISO/RTOs. In most cases,ISO/RTOs use LMPs and the so-calledtwo-settlement system for marketclearing,asbrieﬂyoutlined in Chapter3. This meansthatthe DA schedule is settled atthe DA LMP, andthatanydeviationbetweenthe DA schedule andRT delivery is settled atthe RT LMP [l08]. In most cases,there areno intra-day marketsbetweenDA andRT in the United States. Wind power producers typicallyhavethe option to participatein the DA market.In general, there maybesome chargesfor deviationsbetweenthe RT delivery andthe DA schedule. So far, wind power hastypicallybeenexempt from imbalancechargesin most U.S. markets[26][63]. However, this situationmaychangeasseveralISO/RTOs arerevising their current rules [109]. The FederalEnergy RegulatoryCommission (FERC) is alsorevising wholesalemarketrules for betterintegrationof variablegeneration [110]. The handlingof wind power in general and particularlythe use WPF in U.S. marketswere discussed in more detailin Chapter3. 83Model WPF Price Forecast Objective/Risk Uncertainty Representation Market Rules Intraday Trading Multi-Day Simulator Bathurstetal.2002[104]MatevosyanandSoder2006[19]Pinsonetal.2007[17]Boun'yetal.2008[20]UsaolaandMoreno2009[105]Moralesetal.2010[106]Argonnemodelinthischapter[24][102]Table7-1Overviewofpublishedresearch/modelsforwindpowertrading.Persistencew/prob.tableWindspeedforecastw/powercurveYes,persistenceandfuzzyneuralnetworkYes,NWPbased,kemeldensityestimation(KDE)Yes,fromtheSipreolicomodelNo,generalprobabilisticmodel(AR(2))Yes,probabilistic(quantileregres-sionorKDEw/MCsampling)No,ﬁxedbal.pricerelationsImbalancepricescenariosfromlastdaysNo,ﬁxedimbalancepricesSimpledeter-ministicforecastforimb.pricesYes,simplepricepredictionNo,generalprobabilisticmodel(ARIMA)Yes,normaldist.basedonpricehistoryforDAandRTpricesMin.(max.)imbalancecostMin.imbalancecostMinimbalancecost,analyticsolutionMin.imbalancecost,CVARExpectedproﬁt,noriskProﬁt(hourly)orCVARmetric(daily)Proﬁt,CVAR,orUtility(hourly)84ProbabilitytableforwindpowerWP:ARMAfromerrorsIntervalsforWPF,nopriceuncertaintyWP:KDEDiscretepdfforWP,pdfforpricesScenariotreew/reduction,pricecorrelationWP:Discretepdf,Prices:Randomsamplingw/DA-RTcorrelationUK(NETA),regulationup/dn,shorttermNordPool/Denmark(reg.up/dn)Europe/Netherlands(regulationup/dn)Denmark(regulationup/dn,one-waypenaltySpain(regulationup/dn)Spain(regulationup/dn)UnitedStates(LMP,twosettlement),DAdeviationpenaltyYes,butnoDAtradingNo,notconsideredNo,notconsideredNoFocusonintraday,notDAYes,oneadjustmentmarketNoYes,analysisofoneyearYes,onemonthYes,oneyearYes,oneyearYes,threemonthsNo,onedayanalysisYes,uptofourmonthsincurrentanalysis A wind power producer is facingthree mainuncertaintieswhen biddinginto the DA market:the DA LMP, the RT LMP, and the RT delivery of wind power. We assume that apotential deviation penalty depends on the absolutedeviation between the RT delivery and the DA schedule.21 Then, if we deﬁneaset of joint samples, m = 1...M, of LMPs andwind power delivery, asimple formulationof the wind power producer’sproﬁtfor agiven hour, h, and sample,m, is: T011”= plT)nA,h ' qDA.h ‘I’Plarin' (qgjn 4 (loan)4 Penn/I ' Iqgn 4 qDA,hI (74) Note thatawind power producer hasanincentive to curtailits generationwhenever the RT price drops below0, in order to avoidselling its generationatanegativeprice.”This is the case regardlessof the position in the DA market,since the producer canbuybackenergy in the RT marketatanegativeprice for the energy scheduled DA. Experience shows thatnegativeRT prices mayoccur quite frequently in marketswith LMPs andahigh penetrationof wind power.” The model allowsfor three different assumptionsof how the wind power is controlled when RT prices24 arelow andnegative: 1) The wind farmgeneratesatmaximumpossibleoutput regardlessof the RT price. 2) The wind farmshuts down generationwhenever the RT price is negative,asshown in (7-2). 3) The wind farmmaximizesproﬁtsduring low andnegativeprices, also considering a potentialdeviationpenalty,asshown in (7-3). _ qgjn - plillﬂh20 ‘I5714 I 0 .

In these cases,they haveanincentive to produce even with negativeprices, aslong asthe net proﬁt remainspositive. We do not consider the impactof such incentives here. 23 For example,hourly price datafor the Minnesotahubin MISO for 2009 show thatnegativeLMPs occurred 443 times in the RT market,butonly 29 times in the DA market.We ignore the possibilityof negativeDA prices here. The negativeprices in the RT marketmayto some extent belinked to the wind power beneﬁtsdiscussed in the footnote above. 24 New wind power plantscaneasilybecontrolled to reduce or shut down their generation,andthis ﬂexibilitywill addto their revenue stream.Older wind turbinesmaynot havethis ﬂexibility. 85 The wind power producer needs to decide on how much to bidinto the DA market,qDA1,. We assumethatthe DA offer is bidin atzero price. Hence, the bidwill alwaysbeaccepted,since we assumethatthe DA price is positive. We canre-write the wind power sampleproﬁtin (7-1) to the following: Tfhn I PhnA,h ' qgln ‘l'(PIlinT,h 4 PF/I,n) ' (qgjh 4 qDA,h) 4 penDA ' Iqgln 4 qDA,hI (7-4) In this formulation,the ﬁrstpart(p[)\"A',, - qgfh) is equalto the proﬁtif allof the actualwind power generationis settled atthe DA price. This corresponds to offering aperfect forecastinto the DA market.The latterpartof (7-4) is the consequence of deviatingfrom aperfect forecast.Here, the deviationfrom the forecastis settled atthe difference betweenthe RT andDA LMPs, minus the potentialdeviationpenalty.Note thatthe ﬁrstpartof (7-4) is entirely stochastic.The decision variable,qDA'h, occurs in only the latterpartof (7-4). If LMPs andwind power delivery are known, we cansee from (7-4) that: 1) It is beneﬁcialto deviatefrom aperfect forecastif the difference betweenthe DA andRT LMPs is largerthanthe deviationpenalty.25 2) In the absenceof adeviationpenalty,the proﬁtmaximizingbidis directly dictatedbythe difference in DA andRT prices. If the DA price is higher (lower) thanthe RT price, the producer beneﬁtsfrom biddingall(none) of its capacityin the DA market.Hence, the optimalbidis independent of the wind power delivery and,therefore, alsoindependent of the wind power forecast. The net deviationsettlement as afunction of the RT deviationis illustratedin Fig. 7-1. The ﬁgureshows the deviationsettlement for different assumptionsaboutthe difference betweenDA andRT LMPs with andwithout adeviationpenalty.When there is no deviationpenalty(left), it is evident thatthe wind power producer would wantto maximizethe deviationandbidinto the DA marketaccordingto the price difference betweenthe two markets. A deviationpenalty (right) gives anincentive to minimize the deviationaslong asthe expected price difference is smallerthanthe penalty.Note thatthe deviationsettlement is not symmetric when there is an LMP difference. Of course, the LMPs andthe wind power delivery areunknown atthe time of biddinginto the DA market. A wind power producer therefore hasto consider the combinedrisk from these uncertaintieswhen deciding on abiddingstrategy.All of the three stochasticvariablesaretaken into accountin the biddingmodel presented in Section 7.5. 25 Note thatthis approachis different from most marketdesigns in Europe, with different balancingprices for real- time deviationsup anddown, so the wind power producer cannotbeneﬁtbydeviatingfrom the advanceschedule. 86 _ /‘ _ 267 3 3004‘ ent$/MWh ntS/MWh -60 40 -20 40 60 3 /\" I /1 I / II Em doo is 0 |\\-I 0 as0 cn0 $€ttemeS811 Dev Dev “J - -sew Deviation[MWh] Deviation[MWh] 300 300? _\\l§ - Z3 ntS/MWh S/IVlWl'1 me ment -so 40 20 0 40 60 _ .,.,,e \\\\ .,, \\ 4‘ 0 \\ Deviation[MWh] Deviation[MWh] ette ette -60 0 0 Z0 40 60 Dev.s Dev.s 300-‘ 300-“ entS/MWh entS/MWh 4 l_. 100_ I O 0 I 0 9-9-4!‘ I 0 I 0 O I -so -40 -20 0 20 40 so _ -ree—settem settem J»O J>O M O M O -J>O O)O Dev.

The wind power trading model presented belowcantakeanydiscrete probabilisticrepresentationof the wind power forecast.In our work, we use statisticalapproachesto estimate forecastuncertaintybasedon historical forecastingerrors. We haveappliedbothquantileregression (QR) andKDE to model forecast uncertainty,asbrieﬂyoutlined below. 87 In the case study included in this chapter, we use the QR approachfrom [77] as the main approachto produce probabilisticforecastsbasedon the wind power point forecasterrors. The model employs alinearquantileregression with the basefunctions formulatedascubicB-splines in order to obtainthe quantilewith aproportion of the forecasterrors. Eachquantileis modeled as asum of the nonlinearsmooth functions of the forecastedwind power generation. Spline basesareused to approximateeachof the smooth functions as alinearcombinationof base functions. The probabilisticforecastis represented through aset of quantilesfor eachhour of the dayrangingfrom 0.05 to 0.95 with a0.05 increment. The method describedin [78] is used to generateanumberof wind power scenariosthatprovide informationon the dependency of the prediction errors through the set of look-aheadtimes. The method is basedon the conversion of the set of randomvariablescomposing probabilistic forecastseries, asobtainedwith the QR method describedabove,into amultivariateGaussian random variable.The temporal interdependence structure is represented by the covariance matrix,which is recursively estimatedbecauseof the nonstationarycharacteristics.Monte Carlo simulationis used for the generationof equiprobablescenarios.Fig. 7-2 andFig. 7-3 illustrate the resulting forecastquantiles(which areequivalentto forecastintervals)andscenariosof wind power generation,respectively. 1 - - I - - I - - I - - I - - I - - I - I I - 0.8 > 90% int.

In this case, we use conditional kernel density estimation to produce a nonparametricprobabilisticwind power forecast, from which we derive hourly samples for availablewind power generationfor eachhour of the next day,qgfh. In short, conditionaldensity estimation consists of estimating the density of a random variableY, knowing that the explanatoryrandom variableX is equal to x. For the wind power problem, it consists of forecastingthe wind power probabilitydensity function (pdﬁattime step t for eachlook-ahead time step t+k of agiven time-horizon when aset of explanatoryvariables(e.g., numerical weatherprediction variablesandcurrent wind power) is known. When translatedto anequation, we have: - f ’ , fP(pt+klX = xt+k|t) = <7-5) where p,+k is the wind power forecastedfor look-aheadtime t+k, x,+k|, is the explanatoryvariable forecasted for look-aheadtime step t+k and availableat time step t, ﬁ>,x(p;+kIy¢+kI,) is the multivariatedensity function, andfX(x) is the marginaldensity of X. The output is the forecasted pdf for wind power generation,which is then converted into aprobabilitymassfunction (pmf) with aset of M equallyprobablepoints for eachhour. Scenariogenerationis not required, as eachhour is treatedindependently in the wind power tradingproblem, as further discussed below.More detailsaboutthe KDE forecastingmethods canbefound in [93]—[95]. In the case study, we do abriefcomparisonof applyingQR andthe two KDE methods to the wind power tradingproblem. 7.5 A Model for Wind Power Tradingunder Uncertainty Our wind power tradingmodel optimizes the quantityto bidinto the DA marketfor awind power producer. We use adiscrete representationof uncertaintyin the hourly wind power forecast,asoutlined in the previous section. DA andRT LMPs arealsorepresented asdiscrete probabilitydistributions,asexplainedbelow.We use the wind power andLMP informationto calculatediscrete probabilitydistributionsfor the wind power producer’sproﬁtasafunction of the DA bid. This allows us to derive optimal DA bids under different assumptions for the decision maker’srisk preferences. The initialideasfor the wind power tradingmodel were ﬁrstpresented in [24]. Since then, we have extended the model and analysisin multiple directions. We use different statistical approachesfor probabilisticWPF, andwe havedeveloped amore complete description of the decision problem.We haveconducted amore detailedcasestudy basedon hypotheticalwind farmdata,asdocumented in the next section. We havealsoappliedthe model to acasestudy of areal-worldwind farm[102]. 89 7.5.1 Representationof Uncertaintyin DA andRT LMPs We use astraightforvvardmodel to project DA and RT LMPs for the next day. The price forecastsarebasedon historicalLMPs.26 A window of four weeks from the most recent history is used to estimatethe mean,variance,andcorrelationfor eachindividualhour of the next day. Weekdaysandweekend daysaretreatedindependently. Hourly samplesof DA andRT LMPs arethen drawnfrom (7-6) and(7-7) with the estimatedparameters.Note thatthe sametwo sets of randomsamples(51%, 51%) areused in allhours: P3411 = 512114 ' 04DA,h + IuDA,h (7'6) Piihji = (Ph ' 5614 ‘I’V 1 4 Phz) ' 5131 ' 04RT,h + /~lRT,h (7'7) This discrete representationof the uncertaintyin LMPs assumesthatprices follow anormal distribution.However, anyprobabilitydistributionscould beused, aslong asthe distributionsare converted to discrete samples. A set of M joint randomsamples for DA andRT LMPs are generatedandpairedwith the wind power pmf to form atotalset of M samplesfor allthree randomvariables.Note thatthe formulationin (7-6) and(7-7) includes the correlationbetween DA andRT LMPs. In areaswith largesharesof wind power, there could alsobeasigniﬁcant negativecorrelationbetweenLMPs andwind power. The wind-LMP correlationcould alsobe captured. For instance, amore elaborateprice forecasting system thatuses the wind power forecastasinput canbefound in [111]. A more advancedprice forecastingsystem could easily beincorporatedinto the model, aslong asthe price forecastshaveadiscrete representation. 7.5.2 MathematicalFormulationof the DA Bidding Problem The objectivefor the wind power producer is to ﬁndthe optimalDA bid,qDAh, depending on the decision criterion adopted.We consider three different objectivefunctions for the problem,as shown in (7-8)—(7-10): (1) expected proﬁt,(2) CVAR [112], and(3) expected utility [1 13]. The decision maker’srisk preferences are reﬂected in the choice of objective function and corresponding parameters.The expected proﬁtcriterion in (7-8) is risk neutral. The CVAR criterion in (7-9) is risk averse,since the lower partof the proﬁtdistribution(i.e., CVAR) carries additionalweight in the objective function. For the utility criterion, we assume astandard exponentialutility function [1 13], asshown in (7-10). The utility function canrangefrom risk prone to risk averse,depending on the ﬂparameter.

Constraints(7-2) or (7-3) applydepending on the assumptionof wind power control during negativeprices, as discussed above.In addition,we impose thatthe DA bidmust bebelowthe normalizedcapacity of the wind farm (i.e., 0 3 qDA'h 3 1). In general, the resulting optimizationproblem is a nonlinearprogrammingproblem.We use the generalizedreduced gradientalgorithmbuiltinto Excel’ssolver to ﬁndthe solution.”The model currently hasasimple user interfacein Excel (Fig. 7-4), andis astand-aloneExcel application.Multi-hour simulationscanbeconducted to analyzethe performanceof the different biddingstrategiesover time, asillustratedin the case study in the next section.

However, the optimizationproblemonly hasone decision variable,which is constrainedbetween0 and1. Possiblelocaloptimacantherefore easilybeidentiﬁedandruled out (experience shows thatthe problemoccurs most frequently with arisk-prone utility function). An initialstartingpoint for the searchis alsoprovided to guide the algorithmin the right direction. 9] 7.6 CaseStudy: HypotheticalWind Farmin Illinois In this section, we applythe model outlined abovein acasestudy of ahypotheticalwind farmin the stateof Illinois. We analyzehow DA bidsdepend on risk preferences anddeviationpenalty schemes, assumingthatwind power is sold asmerchantgeneration. 7.6.1 Assumptions We analyzethe biddingof ahypotheticalwind farmin the stateof Illinois, using wind power datafrom one location(site 4848) in the EastemWind IntegrationandTransmissionStudy (EWITS) [83]. The EWITS databaseprovides bothpoint forecast andrealizedwind power generation. The underlying datamethodology is explained in [84]. Datafrom Januaryto August 2006 are used to train the quantile regression method [77] in order to generate probabilisticforecasts.A totalof 1,000 scenariosof wind power generationaregeneratedfor eachhour of the dayfor October,November,andDecemberusing the Monte-Carlosampling scheme from [78]. The deterministic point forecastand10 forecastscenariosareshown for one selected dayin Fig. 7-5. The ﬁgureillustratesthatforecastscenariosspanarelativelywide range aroundthe point forecast.

We use marketprice datafrom the Illinois tradinghubin the MISO to estimate the price parametersfor eachindividualhour with the methodology outlined in Section 7.5.1. Fig. 7-6 shows the resulting price parametersfor October 9. Monte-Carlo simulation generates 1,000 scenariosfor DA andRT prices for eachhour. The price scenariosarecombinedwith the wind power scenariosdescribedabove.The resulting set of scenariosis used to evaluateDA bidding,marketproﬁts,andrisk measuresunder different decision criteria.Illustrationsof price scenariosareshown in Fig. 7-7, with RT prices clearlyhavingawider rangeof uncertaintythan DA prices. Note thatthe uniformity betweenthe hours occurs becausethe samerandomsample is used for allhours of eachday.Capturingthe inter-temporalcorrelationis not importantin this problembecauseeachhour is optimized individually. 92 SCI 1 . 0.3 L .. ~; 04 -5- 1_ ' '-.\" \".‘_ 0 __. - . .

Finally,we present results where the effectiveness of the different strategiesareevaluatedover a one-month period againstactualhistoricalprice data.The defaultassumptionin this casestudy is thatthe wind power producer curtailsthe output during negativeprices, accordingto (7-2). For 93 the CVAR decision criterion in (7-9), we assumeaCVAR threshold, th, of 5% andaweight, w, of 0.1. For the utility decision criterion in (7-10), we assumethatthe risk parameter,B, is either -3 (risk averse)or +3 (risk prone). The min-maxproﬁtrangein the utility function is set to [-100, 120]. These valuesarechosen for illustrativepurposes. In reality,the choice of decision criteria and corresponding parametersshould reﬂectthe actualrisk preferences of the wind power producer. 7.6.2.1 Analysisof Bidding in Selected Hour We now investigatethe biddingproblemfor one selected hour (i.e., hour 5 on October9 (Fig. 7-5 through Fig. 7-7) in more detail.Table7-2 shows thatthe expected DA price is slightly higher thanthe expected RT price for this hour. However, the RT price is much more volatile, resulting in amuch largerspreadin RT price scenariosascomparedto DA (Fig. 7-7). There is alsoasigniﬁcantcorrelationbetweenDA andRT prices. The wind power forecastis relatively low, with only 17.4% of installedcapacityexpected to beavailable.However, the 1,000 wind power scenariosspanawide rangefrom 0 to 72.8% of installedcapacity.

For the expected valuecriterion (E), it is evident thatthatthe optimalDA bidis to bidallcapacityin the DA market.This result is not surprising given that/.tDA'5 > /JRT5. In this case,it will alwaysbe optimalto bidmaximumcapacityin the DA marketunder the proﬁtcriterion, regardlessof the wind power forecast,aslong asthere is no deviationpenalty.The CVAR criterion (C) yields an optimalbidjust slightly abovezero. This is becausethe CVAR decreasesasafunction of bid quantity(Fig. 7-10). The optimalbidunder the risk-averseutility criterion is 0.39, whereasit is the sameasunder expected proﬁtwith arisk-prone utility function. The results clearlyillustrate thatthe optimalbiddingdecisions depend on the risk preferences of the decision maker. The level of risk for different biddingquantitiesis further explored in Fig. 7-10. The ﬁgure shows thatthe variancein proﬁtis lowest aroundthe point forecastlevel of wind generation.The proﬁtvarianceincreasesquickly asafunction of higher amountsof biddingin the DA market. Although the variancealsoincreasesfor bidsbelowthe point forecast,the increaseis relatively modest. In this case,the producer is likely to sell some of its generationin the RT market.Still, the producer canhedge againstselling atnegativeprices in RT bynot producing andthereby controlling some of the risk. In contrast,the producer cannothedge againstbuyingathigh RT prices, which is more likely to occur the more power is bidinto the DA market.This explainsthe high variancefor high biddingquantities.It alsoexplainswhy the one-sided CVAR measure declines asafunction of qDA'5. Fig. 7-10 alsoindicatesthe impacton varianceandCVAR from curtailingwind at negative prices. Curtailmentclearlyreduces CVAR considerablyfor low biddingquantities,becauseselling atnegativeprices in the RT marketis avoided,reducing the downside risk. Note thatcurtailingthe wind power when prices arenegativealsotends to extend the upside of the proﬁtdistribution,since the producer beneﬁtsfrom buyingatnegativeprices insteadof producing, regardlessof the bidquantity. 94 P|1:|ﬁlIAdj.Pr0ﬁl$,1r-nw Fig. 7-8 Expected profit (E) andCVAR criteria(C) asfunction of DA bidquantity,no deviation penalty(hour 5, Oct. 9, 2006) 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 4-if-\" _ -—I—K; @- 1-‘ \"I- -I. _- \"1.- IQ- E _ '-v :_ SC CI S 0.8 0.795 Illflll-=-3} Ut 0.79 0.785 0.78 Ll'| 0. 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 Day-AheadBid Qu antity /’ _ I I _ _-|- _ I I ,0 _ I I’? § -Iff§wQ4’ '4.- .--:1‘-' _i\" i 3 ___ B23 '_ 0 0.05 0.1 0..lb 0.2 0.21 0.3 [Lb 0.-‘l U.-‘lb 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.! 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.5 0.95 l Day-AheadBid Quantity Fig. 7-9 Expected utility for the risk-averse(B = -3) and risk-prone (B deviationpenalty.

No capacityis bidinto the DA marketwhen the expected RT price is higher thanthe expected DA price under this criterion. The risk-prone utility criterion gives almostexactlythe sameresults (not included in Fig. 7-13). With the CVAR andrisk-averseutility criteria,the optimalbidis in betweenthe maximum andminimum capacityin hours with asmall difference in expected DA andRT prices. The bidquantitytends to behigher with the utility criterion thanit is with the CVAR criterion. Overall,the decision strategiesaremainlydriven bythe price expectations,aslong as there is no deviationpenalty. We repeatthe analysiswith adeviationpenaltyof US$5/MWh andUS$10/MWh (Fig. 7-14 and Fig. 7-15). The results show thatadeviationpenaltywould bringthe bidscloser to the projected generation(i.e., the point forecast)under the expected proﬁt,CVAR, andrisk-averseutility criteria.We cansee asimilareffect for the risk prone utility criterion (Fig. 7-16); however, the impactof the penaltyis less prominent becauseof the willingness to takemore risk. Finally,the trade-offsbetweenexpected proﬁtandCVAR for the full dayareillustratedin Fig. 7-17 andFig. 7-18 for the different biddingstrategies.The results show thatthe expected proﬁt criterion (E) yields the highest expected proﬁt.The risk-averseCVAR andutility criterialeadto lower proﬁtbuthigher CVAR. Finally,it is interesting to note thatthe point forecast,pf, is not on the efﬁcientfrontier for the full day,asthe CVAR criteriascore higher in bothexpected proﬁt 97 andCVAR. This result is the casebothwith andwithout adeviationpenalty.Note thatproﬁtand CVAR aremetrics thatcanbescaledup andcalculatedover anytime resolution. In contrast,the utility function requires adeﬁnitionof aminimum-maximumrange andtherefore cannotbe scaledup in the samemanner.

One could do this bysamplingfrom the probabilitydistributions used in the optimization problem. However, a better test for performance in the realworld is to use historicalrealizationsof the stochastic variablesto calculaterealizedproﬁtover anextended time period. We havetherefore developed asimple simulatorin which decision criteriacanbetested basedon real-worlddata.The optimalDA bid for eachhour is derived basedon probabilisticforecastsfor wind power andprices, asoutlined in Section 7.5. In turn, the realizedproﬁtfor eachhour is calculatedwith the historicalwind power andprice data. In this case study, we have used wind power data(forecast and realized generation) for October2006 from site 4848 in the EWITS study. We combinedthe wind power datawith DA andRT price datafor the Illinois hubatthe MISO for October2009.28 Summarystatisticsfor wind power andprice dataareprovided in Table7-3. Note thatRT prices haveamuch higher volatilityandspread as comparedto the DA prices. Table7-5 summarizesthe results from testing the wind power tradingmodel with different decision criteriaover the one-month period. Table7-5 Summarystatisticsfor wind power andDA/RT prices, October. Wind Power DA Price RT Price [% of capacity] [$/MWh] [$/MWh] Average 0.39 25.12 24.65 StandardDeviation 0.31 15 .399° \\o\\o Minimum 0.00 10.40 -39.10 Maximum 0.96 53.89 223.34 28 Note thatthe wind andprice dataarefrom two different yearsin this analysis.We do not consider the correlation betweenwind power andprice in the probabilisticforecasts. At the same time, the wind power datais for a hypotheticalsite, so there is no relationshipbetweenthe price andwind power data.Hence, it is not importantto havesynchronized time series of prices andwind power in this casestudy. In current work, we aretesting the model on datafrom arealwind farm,andin this casewe do use synchronized wind andprice data[I02]. I00 We ﬁrstanalyzethe results with no deviationpenalty.The trade-offbetweentotalproﬁtover the month andthe CVAR calculatedbasedon the distributionof hourly realizedresults is shown in Fig. 7-19. The expected proﬁt(E*) and risk-seeking utility (U*([3=0.3)) strategies give the highest proﬁtbutalsothe lowest CVAR. The CVAR strategy(C*), in particularwith the weight of 0.3, gives amuch higher CVAR, asexpected. Note thatbiddingaccordingto the point forecast (pf) gives much lower proﬁtbuthasalow risk level. This outcome is alsothe casefor the strategyof constantlybiddingzero capacity(zero) into the DA market,therebyselling allof the energy into the RT market. The trade-offbetweenthe wind farmproﬁton the one handandthe deviationfrom DA schedule on the other handis shown in Fig. 7-20. Under most circumstances,the system operatorwill beneﬁtfrom keeping the deviationsfrom the DA schedule assmallaspossible.”Among allof the strategiesconsidered, point forecastbiddinggives the lowest absolutedeviationfrom the DA schedule. However, this strategyalsoyields alow totalproﬁt.Hence, in this casethere are clearlyconﬂictingobjectivesbetweenthe wind farmowners andthe system operator.This result is in line with our analysisin Chapter2, where we discuss the valueof WPF for different market participantsandhow trainingcriteriafor wind power point forecastscanbetuned accordingto the objectivesof the forecastusers. The results for allof the strategiesunder the assumptionof no deviationpenaltyaresummarized in Table7-8. One interesting observationis thatthe strategiesthatconsider the price forecastsall bidmore into the DA marketthanthe wind power point forecast,asshown bythe averageDA bid.This is becausethe biddingstrategyis driven byprice expectations.The averageDA price is higher thanthe averageRT price in the simulationperiod (Table7-5), andthis is reﬂectedin the price projections. Hence, in the absenceof adeviationpenalty,the wind power producers bid abovethe point forecast to take advantageof expected higher DA prices. The price-based strategiesresult in ahigher proﬁt,butalsoincreasethe wind power producer’srisk exposure measuredin terms of the hourly varianceandCVAR (Table7-8). 1.0 0,0 -— l I l I .1_07000 7200 7400 7600 7000 O pf zero I E* -4.0 \" ._.

We now repeatthe analysiswith a $5/MWh deviationpenalty.The results areshown in Fig. 7-21 andFig. 7-22. In this case,it is actuallythe point forecastthatperforms the bestin terms of totalproﬁt.Among the strategies considering the price predictions, it is the risk-averse strategies thatperform better (and in particular,the CVAR ones), bothin terms of totalproﬁtandCVAR. The poorer performanceof the proﬁt-basedand risk-prone strategies are probablycaused by inaccuraciesof the price forecasts.When the price predictions indicatealargedifferent betweenDA andRT prices, the optimal strategy will be to deviate from the wind power forecast. However, if the price difference does not materialize,the wind farmwill bepenalizedbythe deviationpenalty.In this case,it therefore appearsto bebetterto rely on the wind power forecastwithout considering the price predictions.”Furthermore, the interests of the wind farmowner andthe system operator arewell alignedin this case(Fig. 7-22 ). The strategythatdoes not bidinto the DA market(zero) still gives alow risk, butthe totalproﬁtis much smallerthanfor the other strategies.The results with a$5/MWh deviationpenaltyare summarizedin Table7-8. Note thatwith adeviation penaltythere is less difference betweenthe strategiesin terms of the averageDA bid. 30 Of course, the price predictions used in this study aresomewhatrudimentary,simply assumingthatprices follow anormaldistributionbasedon historicalprices. However, the price predictions could easilybereplacedwith more advancedprice forecastingmodels. The only requirement is thatthe price distributionneeds to berepresented asa discrete set of price realizationsfor eachindividualhour.

However, one could alsouse the forecastquantilesdirectly to decide on how much to bidinto the DA market.In fact,it wasshown in [23] thatfor arisk-neutralwind power producer thatalways facesaﬁnancialloss from deviations,the optimalschedule is the c+/(c++c‘)quantile,where c+, c‘ are the cost of positive and negative deviations. These assumptions do not hold true in U.S. LMP-basedmarkets,asdiscussed in Section 7.3. Fig. 7-23 shows the monthly proﬁtfor different quantilebids. When there is no deviation penalty,the wind power producer’sproﬁtincreasesbybiddingahigher quantile,andthe 90% quantilegives the highest proﬁt(this corresponds to overscheduling, asthere is a90% chance thatthe actualgenerationwill bebelowthis quantile).However, the biddingstrategybasedon the expected proﬁtcriterion (E*) gives aconsiderablyhigher proﬁt.When adeviationpenaltyis introduced, abidaccordingto 60% quantileproduces aslightly higher proﬁtthanthe point forecast,whereasbidsaccordingto E*gives alower proﬁtin this case.As areference, optimal biddingwith perfect informationon prices andwind power would produce atotalmonthly proﬁt of $9,740 and$8,405, respectively, in the caseswith andwithout adeviationpenalty.Bidding the realizedwind generationwould yield $7,255 in bothcases.Fig. 7-24 shows thatthe CVAR decreasesfor higher quantilebids,which meansthatthe risk level increasesasmore capacityis offered into the DA market. 7600 5 7500 S5 7400 5 7300 2 13 7200 35 7100 2 7000 .\"2 19 6900 6500 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 ..... -- - ------- _*'q“mm$ pf E* $/MW-month 3;‘ ~4- OL D. ru 4-» O l— 6600 500 6400 300 200 6100 6000 5900 5800 G5 G503 1 41) -0- quantiles 1 P 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Quantile Quantile Fig. 7-23 Monthly profit for different quantile forecasts compared to bidding basedon point forecastandbasedon the expected profit criterion, no penalty(left), $5/MWh deviationpenalty (right).

However, in this project, we have developed two novel methods for probabilisticWPF with kernel density estimation(KDE), namelybasedon the Nadaraya-Watson(NW) [93] andquantilecopula(QC) [94] [95] estimators.Results from [93], [94], and[95] indicatethatthe KDE methods produce betterprobabilisticforecaststhanquantileregression (QR) in terms of calibration,which is a measurefor how well the forecastedquantilesmatchthe distributionof realizedwind power generation.We ﬁndthe sameresults when comparingdifferent probabilisticforecastingmethods on the wind farmdatafor this case study. Fig. 7-25 shows thatthe deviationfrom perfect calibrationis smallerfor the KDF-basedNW andQC methods comparedto linearandsplines QR. When it comes to sharpness,which is ameasureof the width of the conﬁdenceintervalsof the probabilisticforecasts,there areonly smalldifferences betweenthe four methods. -10 10 X X V V I T V {I°‘o>8- <i\\< / /1 11/></ 0/X/ \\ X OX / \\>.I I OX OX °{‘\\ OX / 6*“.-8‘ <1: <u <rz\\ <\\\\ <iz\\ _ vz _ />4 v-V _ x4 -x V /V V// ,2- \\ \\.. /\\.-V / Viv X 6 o\\X X v—v\\v_v4V J- -;,J./ Q0 _: _ / / , OX 4 / 0 /V,/ I l I I I l I lil I I l I I l I I Ll I l I I I I I li Fig. 7-25 Evaluationof probabilisticforecasts for different methods: calibration(left) and sharpness(right).

In order to investigatethe impactof the different forecastingmethods, we repeatthe monthly runs using the NW andQC methods for probabilisticWPF andfor the CVAR strategyunder a $5/MWh deviationpenalty.The results arecomparedto the originalrun with probabilisticWPF from QR andscenariogeneration.Table7-8 shows thatthe choice of probabilisticwind power forecast apparentlyhas only limited impact on the results in this case. For the current assumptions, the differences between the WPF methods are small for the CVAR bidding strategy.The differences betweenthe variousbiddingstrategies,which aredriven largelybythe price projections, aremuch larger,aswe haveseen above.However, further work is needed to investigatehow the decisions are inﬂuencedbythe probabilisticWPF methods. Our initial results from areal-worldwind farmindicatethatthe choice of forecastingmethod hasalarger impacton the results.

We conclude thatstochasticmodels, like the one proposed here, will be important tools to control the trade-offbetweenrisk and return for wind power producers participatingin electricity markets. The results presented in this chapter demonstrate that probabilisticwind power forecastscanplayanimportantrole in guiding wind power trading decisions in the DA andRT markets.The results alsoindicatethatprice forecastsareimportant in order to derive good tradingstrategies,particularlyunder marketdesigns without penaltiesfor deviations between DA schedule and RT delivery. Furthermore, risk preferences clearly inﬂuencethe optimaltradingdecisions, with risk-averseowners biddingless energy into the DA marketto reduce the exposure to high RT prices. The decisions arealsohighly dependent on marketdesign, andthe results show thatadeviationpenaltydrives the optimalDA bidcloser to the point forecastfor allstrategies.This is in the interest of the system operator,asit makesthe taskof balancingsupply anddemandin the system aneasierone. However, deviationpenalties also add asigniﬁcantﬁnancialburden on wind power producers and therefore reduce the proﬁtabilityof wind power. Revising market rules to give efﬁcientoperationalincentives without addinganundue burdenon wind power andother renewableswill clearlybeachallenge aswe move forward. The wind power tradingmodel andanalysisoutlined in this chapteraregeneralin natureandcan beextended in severaldirections. For instance,the model could beneﬁtfrom more advanced price predictions, which capturepotentialrelationshipsbetweenwind power andprices. Further explorationof different probabilisticWPF methods andtheir impacton tradingdecisions should alsobeinvestigated.Moreover, alternativemarketrules (different deviationpenaltiesandother incentive schemes, intra-daymarkets,etc.) canbeintroduced for amore detailedanalysisof the impactof marketdesign on biddingdecisions, wind power proﬁts,andthe overalloperationof the power system. Considering the interplaybetweendifferent assets,including wind power, in a portfolio is alsoaninteresting extension. Overall,more testing on real-worldwind datawould contributeto validatethe methodology anddocument the advantagesof the proposed modeling framework.We areaddressingsome of these issues in our recent work, which is documented in [102]. I06 8 CONCLUSIONS This report presented our work on the applicationof advancedWPF in operationaldecisions, from the perspectives of bothsystem operatorsandwind power producers. The mainﬁndings andconclusions aresummarizedbelow. Different agentsin the electricity marketmaydisagreewhen it comes to assessingawind power forecastaccordingto its value andquality. Our case study of the Iberianelectricity market showed thata“neutral”model (in the forecaster’sparadigmsense) might not leadto maximized proﬁts for wind power producers. In fact, if imbalanceprices are asymmetric, the proﬁt- maximizingbidwill deviatefrom the unbiasedpoint forecast. This meansthatawind power producer maybewilling to reduce the forecasts’accuracyin exchangefor anincreasein income. Yet, electricity markets should provide the participantswith incentives for delivering their unbiasedforecastl11fOITﬂ21lllO1\"1through their scheduling andbidding.Our contributionsregarding this topic include: 0 A challengeto the assumptionof the mathematicalneutralityof the forecastingmodels; 0 A thorough discussion of conﬂictinginterests associatedwith the “goodness”of forecasts for wind power producers andsystem operators; 0 A comparisonof the relativeadvantagesanddrawbacksof severalstate-of-theartcriteria used in the trainingof statisticalWPF models; 0 A new approachproposed to achieve acceptable“compromise”solutions to market participantsin the choice of aforecastingmodel with the parametriccorrentropy criterion from informationtheoretic leaming;and 0 The veriﬁcationof the proposed theoreticalconcepts in arepresentativecasestudy of the Iberianelectricity market(SpainandPortugal). WPF canclearlycontributeto amore efﬁcientintegrationof wind power andother renewable resources into the electric power grid. In areview of the current use of WPF in ﬁveISO/RTO marketsin the United States,we found thatmost system operatorsarealreadyusing WPF to support operationaldecisions; however, the experience to dateis still relativelylimited. There is therefore aneed to betterintegrateWPF into operationalprocedures, including determinationof operatingreserve requirements, DA marketclearing,reliabilitycommitment decisions, andRT dispatch.Improving the efﬁciencyandreliabilityof power systems with high sharesof wind power canbeachievedthrough: 0 Developing new tools andprocedures for system operatorsandmarketparticipants,so as to make more efﬁcientuse of WPF information, enablingbetteroperationaldecisions under the growing uncertainty and variabilitydue to the increasing penetration of renewables; 0 Makingimprovements in generaldecision makingunder uncertaintyandparticularlyin the handlingof wind power uncertaintyin commitment anddispatchof energy andoperating reserves; and 0 Promoting improvements in WPF models bybettertuning them to the speciﬁcneeds of the forecastusers, such asbetterpredictions of uncertaintyandrampingevents for system operators. I07 We haveconducted adetailedanalysisof the impactof WPF errors on UC andED. In particular, we haveanalyzedthe potentialuse of probabilisticWPF in the scheduling anddispatchof power systems with amix of thermalpower plantsandwind power. We havedeveloped astochastic UC model, where wind power uncertaintyis represented in terms of aset of forecastscenarios. We havealsodeveloped ascenarioreduction algorithmto select anadequateset of wind power scenariosfor use in stochasticUC. Moreover, we haveexplored how probabilisticforecastscan beused to derive dynamicoperatingreserve requirements for use in adeterministic UC. Based on the applicationof these tools in severalcasestudies, we conclude that: 9 Commitment decisions basedon adeterministic wind power point forecastaretoo risky andarelikely to result in high levels of unserved loadandreserve. Hence, additional operatingreserves areneeded to handlethe uncertaintyin wind power. 9 For deterministic UC, adynamicoperatingreserve requirement basedon probabilistic forecasts performs better than a ﬁxed additionalreserve, becausethe amount of additionaloperatingreserves is adjustedaccordingto the predicted forecastuncertainty. 9 Stochastic UC with wind power scenarios has advantagesover the traditional deterministic scheduling approaches.First, stochastic UC addresses inter-temporal variabilitythrough the scenariorepresentationof uncertainty.Second, the expected cost of scarcityis explicitly takeninto accountin the objectivefunction. However, the high computationalburdenmayprevent implementationon large-scalesystems. 9 The choice of scenarioset is very importantin stochasticUC. Formalscenarioreduction methods appearto lower the level of hedging in commitment decisions, asthey tend to reduce the overallscenariovariance.At the sametime, ahigher numberof scenarios improves the operatingresults, butmaybe prohibitive for computationalreasons. A certainlevel of additionaloperatingreserves is therefore alsolikely to beneeded with stochasticUC, asthe scenariosdo not capturethe full rangeof forecastuncertainty. 9 Detenninistic UC combinedwith dynamic operatingreserves does not address inter- temporal ramping events, but the approachis better aligned with current operating practicesandthe computationalburdenis much smallerthanwith stochasticUC. 9 Stochastic UC with forecast scenarios and deterministic UC with dynamic operating reserves give similarresults in terms of cost andreliabilityin our casestudies, although there maybedistinct differences in commitment anddispatchdecisions. 9 Probabilisticforecastscontributeto improved operationaldecisions bothin the casesof dynamicoperatingreserves andstochasticUC. 9 More work should beconducted to analyzethe potentialuse of probabilisticforecasting andstochasticscheduling under more realisticassumptions,for instancebyintroducing additionaloperationalconstraints(e.g., transmission)in the UC formulation. 9 It is importantfor system andmarketoperatorsto consider their risk preferences in determining operationalstrategies, and properly represent this in the mathematical models used to support their decisions. 9 We recommend that system operators start making use of probabilisticforecasting informationin their scheduling decisions. A ﬁrststep would beto move towardthe use of dynamicoperatingreserve requirements. Next, asprobabilisticWPF andcomputational resources improve, system operatorsshould consider anentirely stochasticscheduling approach,where WPF uncertaintyis fully represented in the UC formulation. I08 We alsoinvestigatedthe use of probabilisticWPF for wind power producers. We presented a model for optimaltradingof wind power in DA electricity marketsunder uncertaintyin wind power andprices. We arguedthatsuch models constitute importanttools to control the trade-off betweenrisk andreturn for wind power producers thatparticipatein the electricity market.Our results havedemonstratedthat: 9 ProbabilisticWPF canplayanimportantrole in guiding wind power tradingdecisions in the DA andRT markets; 9 Price forecastsareimportantin order to derive good tradingstrategies,particularlywhen there areno deviationpenaltiesbetweenDA schedule andRT delivery; 9 Risk preferences inﬂuencethe optimaltrading decisions, with risk-averse wind power producers biddingless energy into the DA marketto reduce the exposure to high RT prices; 9 Deviationpenaltiesdrive the optimalDA bidcloser to the point forecast,which implies thatsystem operatorshaveaneasiertaskin balancingsupply anddemand,butalsothat wind power producers’income is reduced; 9 Improved scheduling decisions andbetterrisk managementwill increasethe viabilityof wind power in the long run; and 9 Overall, an important challenge will be to deﬁne market rules that provide efﬁcient operationalincentives without alteringthe burdenon wind power andother renewables.
