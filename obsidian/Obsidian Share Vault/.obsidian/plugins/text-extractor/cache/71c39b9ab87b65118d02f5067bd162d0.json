V, MORNING CONSULT’ 5 IN THIS REPORT 7 Topical Outlook 7 Six-Month Forecast 8 Macro Outlook 9-12 Topical Findings 13 Methodology 14 About the Author Societal Polarization & Nationalism Outlook V, MORNING CONSULT’ 6 SIX-MONTH FORECAST Societal Polarization & Nationalism While national pride remains pervasive globally, declines in major developed markets seeing recent government instability or turnover — including France, Germany, and the United States — have driven a dip in the global average. Relatively low pride in peer markets (Japan and the United Kingdom) is meanwhile helping to pin the average down. Over H2 2024, this decline coincided with an increase in nativist sentiment, marked by noteworthy upticks in the average share of global adults espousing isolationist and anti-immigrant views (both up two points over the past six months). The average share of adults who say they trust their compatriots is meanwhile down one point. Per our data, opposition to immigration and distrust in one’s fellow countrymen tend to go hand in hand, with the markets showing large declines in support for immigration also commonly showing large dips in societal trust. Collectively these dynamics affirm the narrative that global publics are broadly turning inwards heading into 2025. Governments will face heightened pressure to adapt their policymaking in turn. Societal Polarization & Nationalism Qutlook Notably, it's the world’s largest markets — the United States and China — who lead the pack (alongside Brazil) when it comes to the six-month uptick in support for isolationism, with the public in both markets showing a roughly six-point increase in support. The former is in line with prevailing expectations for the incoming Trump administration, which will see majority (56%) support for a more isolationist foreign policy, conducive to tariff imposition, a reduction in U.S. support for NATO and other international institutions, and Washington's general retrenchment on the world stage. China meanwhile displays the most pronounced public support for isolationism of all markets we track, with 71% in favor. The metric suggests Beijing will continue to see public buy-in for its efforts to insulate the country from external headwinds by building up national champions and bolstering domestic demand despite near-term economic challenges. It is also conducive to retaliation in the renewed U.S.-China trade war anticipated for 2025, a scenario we advise treating as a fait accompli.
