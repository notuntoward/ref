As part of our work to understand young people’s civic learning and participation, we have been tracking major trends about the youth vote and sharing key data on election week about young people’s participation, priorities, and choices at the ballot box. Here’s some of what we know about young voters immediately following the election. Data + Analysis: Young Voters in 2024 Updated with data as of November 6, 5:00pm ET We estimate that 42% of young voters (+/- 1%), ages 18-29, cast ballots in the 2024 presidential election, a lower youth turnout than in 2020—when our early estimate put youth turnout above 50%—and approximately on par with the 2016 presidential election. Overall Youth Turnout Down From 2020 But Strong in Battleground States CENTER FOR INFORMATION & RESEARCH ON CIVIC LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT 11/12/24, 9:09 AM The Youth Vote in 2024 | CIRCLE https://circle.tufts.edu/2024-election#white-youth-favored-trump-overall,-key-differences-by-education 1/29 We also estimate that youth voter turnout in battleground states may have been much higher: 50% on aggregate in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Young voters cast 14% of all ballots in the 2024 election, according to the National Election Pool exit poll conducted by Edison Research. While this number may be adjusted in the coming days, and other data sources may show di\u0000erent numbers, this 2024 youth share of the vote was also lower than in 2020 (17%) and to 2016 (19%) based on the sane data source. Our full analysis of youth voter turnout and highlights from the youth vote choice and issues data on this page are in our news release here (https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/overall-youth-turnout-down-2020-strong-battleground-states) . Updated with data as of November 6, 11am ET Young voters favored Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the 2024 election by 6 points: 52% to 46%. That was a much smaller margin than young voters gave President Biden over Trump in 2020 (+25), but still by far the strongest support for Harris of any age group in this election. Five percent of young voters backed a third-party or independent candidate, slightly higher than the 3% who did so in 2020.

Voters ages 18-24 supported Harris by 10 points, while their slightly older peers (25-29) supported Trump by 1 point. These voters ages 25-29, which includes the oldest Gen Z voters and the youngest Millennials, were ages 21-25 in the 2020 election. That year, 18- to 24-year-olds supported Biden by 29 points, which suggests either a major shift from those same young people or very di\u0000erent segments of the youth electorate turning out in 2020 and 2024.

The Gender Gap: Young Women +18 for Harris, Young Men +14 for Trump As many observers expected before the election, there was a signi\u0000cant gender gap among young voters. Young women preferred Harris to Trump by an 18-point margin: 58% to 40%. But young men preferred Trump by an 14-point margin: 42% to 56%. Notably, that gender gap is larger than the gender gap for the electorate overall. Among voters of all ages, 53% of all female voters backed Harris, compared to 46% for Trump (+7). While among all male voters, Trump won 54% to 44% (+10). Youth who identify as nonbinary or in a way other than male or female favored Harris by a 69-point margin (82% vs. 13% for Trump) and were also more likely than other youth to vote for a third-party candidate.

Young white men preferred Trump regardless of whether they had a college degree. However, young white women with a college degree preferred Harris, and those without favored Trump. Youth of color preferred Harris by similar margins whether they have a college degree or not. When comparing to the slightly older 30-44 age groups, we \u0000nd that the youngest white men with a college degree were more likely to vote for Trump than the older voters. On the other hand, the youngest white and nonwhite women without college degrees were more likely to support Harris than their 30- to 44-year-old counterparts. 11/12/24, 9:09 AM The Youth Vote in 2024 | CIRCLE https://circle.tufts.edu/2024-election#white-youth-favored-trump-overall,-key-differences-by-education 5/29 Download image Vote Choice by Age, Race, Gender, and Education: Ages 18-29 vs. 30-44 The percentage of youth by age, race, gender, and education who voted for each presidential candidate in the 2024 presidential election.

Much of that shift appears to be driven by young men, who voted for Biden in 2020 but Trump in 2024, and especially from young white men. Early data suggests that there was an extraordinary 32-point gap in youth vote choice by gender, with young women favoring Harris by 18 percentage points, and young men favoring Trump by 14 points. Nonbinary/other youth supported Harris by a 69-point margin. The data by gender and race combined shows that this shift was largely driven by young white men, who voted for Trump by a 28- point margin. They were the only race/gender group to prefer Trump, though young white women and young Latino men appear to have split their vote equally between Trump and Harris.

And young men were more likely than young women to select each of those issues as their top concern this election—especially immigration. Youth who chose immigration as their top issue in 2024 voted for Trump by a nearly 70-point margin.

And while young voters who prioritized abortion were overwhelmingly likely to vote for Kamala Harris, youth who considered the economy or immigration their top issue favored Donald Trump by wide margins.  The AP VoteCast survey allowed voters to choose one of nine issues as the “most important facing the country.” Forty percent of youth selected “the economy and jobs,” 13% chose abortion, and 11% selected immigration as the most important.

While only 4% of youth chose “foreign policy” as their top issue, being able to select only one issue in the poll may fail to provide an accurate picture of the extent to which youth were concerned about the issue. And among youth who did choose foreign policy as their top priority, 9% voted for a third-party candidate, much higher than youth overall (2%). Notably, when asked which candidate they trusted more to handle “the situation in the Middle East”, 32% said Harris, 45% Trump, 6% both equally, and 16% of youth said neither. Some ambivalence about the candidates they cast ballots for may also be evident in young people’s answers about whether their vote was motivated more by support for their chosen candidate or opposition to their opponent. When asked whether their vote was more re\u0000ective of support for their chosen candidate or opposition to the opponent, 81% of young Trump voters said their vote was for Trump and 19% that it was against Harris. Among youth who voted for Harris, 66% said their vote was for her and 34% that it was against Trump.  Source: Unless otherwise noted, data comes from CIRCLE analyses of the AP VoteCast Survey conducted by the AP-NORC Center for Public A\u0000airs Research for Fox News and The Associated Press Updated with data as of November 6, 11:00am ET While nationally the youth vote favored Kamala Harris over Donald Trump by 6 points: 52% to 46%, there were major di\u0000erences by state, and there appears to be an overall trend of increased youth support for Donald Trump compared to the 2020 presidential race. According to AP VoteCast data, Kamala Harris saw gains over Joe Biden’s numbers with young voters in only three states: Maine, Wisconsin, and Indiana. Meanwhile, in states like Louisiana, Missouri, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Texas, the data suggests that Trump lost the youth vote in 2020 but won it in 2024. In key battleground states like Arizona, Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania, where Biden had strong double-digit youth support in 2020, Harris’ still won young voters but by a much smaller single-digit margin.

One other way to examine and explain this shift is the partisan and ideological makeup of the electorate. Compared to 2020, young voters in 2024 were more likely to identify as conservative and as Republican. And the young moderates who cast ballots were more likely to vote for Trump A Di\u0000erent Partisan and Ideological Make-Up While young voters in 2024 were still more likely to identify as Democrats than as Republicans or with neither party, this year’s youth electorate was more Republican than it was in 2020 by 9 percentage points. Democratic-identifying youth dropped by 5 points and those who identify as “neither” decreased by 4 points. Note that this may not indicate ideological shifts in all young people, but in those who turned out to vote in each election.

Even with those shifts, young Black and Latino men still were more likely to identify as Democrats, while young white were 25 points more likely to identify as Republicans—an 11 point increase over 2020. 11/12/24, 9:09 AM The Youth Vote in 2024 | CIRCLE https://circle.tufts.edu/2024-election#white-youth-favored-trump-overall,-key-differences-by-education 16/29 Download image Every Race/Gender Group of Youth Had More Voters Identifying as Republicans than in 2020 Among voters 18-29, there were large shifts in party identification between 2020 and 2024, especially by race/ethnicity.

Young people who identify as neither major party also made up a smaller part of the 2024 youth electorate.

Latino/Hispanic youth had an especially high share of new voters (40%), followed by Asian youth (33%), Black youth (32%), and white youth (26%).

Young Latinos and youth without college experience have historically participated at lower rates, so it may be a positive sign that there were more new voters among these groups in 2024. Forty percent of the voting-eligible youth population are young people without college experience, and 38% of all youth votes were cast by this group in 2024, which puts these non-college youth closer to full representation in the electorate Updated with data as of November 6, 11am ET Young Latinos favored Vice President Harris by a substantial 20-point margin over former President Trump in the 2024 presidential election. However, that’s a signi\u0000cant shift from their 2020 vote choice, when they preferred President Biden by a 49-pont margin over Trump. That is the largest shift for any racial/ethnic group of youth between the 2020 and 2024 elections. Among all Latinos, youth were still the age group with the strongest support for Harris in an election in which the entire Latino electorate shifted toward Trump.

Other sources, like the National Election pool exit poll, showed a smaller, single-digit margin for Harris among all Latinos. One of the other highly notable things about the young Latino electorate in 2024 is that it was relatively “new”—meaning, it was full of young people who had never voted before in a general election. While every youth electorate has a sizable percentage of new voters who have aged into voting, forty percent of young Latinos who cast a ballot did so for the \u0000rst time, compared to about a third of young Asian and Black voters, and a quarter of young white voters.

Salvadoran, Mexican, and Puerto Rican youth had the highest support for Kamala Harris.

More than 40% of young Latinos selected it as their #1 issue, about the same as all voters. No other issue was chosen by more than 12% of young Latinos—abortion and immigration followed the economy with 11% each. The striking similarities in young Latinos’ issue priorities and those of all young voters may further speak to the fact that the economy was the dominant issue in this election. Because this survey only allowed youth to select one issue, it may obscure other di\u0000erences in concerns between Latinos and other youth, which we will explore in our subsequent work. 11/12/24, 9:09 AM The Youth Vote in 2024 | CIRCLE https://circle.tufts.edu/2024-election#white-youth-favored-trump-overall,-key-differences-by-education 22/29 Download image Latino Youth and Overall Youth Priorities Were Very Similar: Economy and Jobs Was the Top Issue The percentage of young Latinos and of all youth (ages 18-29) who said  each was their top issue in the 2024 election.
