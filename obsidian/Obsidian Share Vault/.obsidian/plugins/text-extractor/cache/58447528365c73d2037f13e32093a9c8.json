By estimating RUL, engineers can schedule maintenance, optimiz e oper ating e \u0000 ciency , and a v oid unplanned downtime. F or this r eason, estimating RUL is a t op priority in pr edictiv e maintenance pr ogr ams. An RUL estimation model pr o vides a con \u0000 dence-bound RUL pr ediction. The model inputs ar e condition indicat ors (f eatur es) extr acted fr om sensor data whose beha vior changes in a pr edictable wa y as the system degr ades. The method used t o calculate RUL depends on the kind of data a v ailable: Lif etime data indicating how long it t ook for similar machines t o r each failur e Run-t o-failur e hist ories of similar machines A known thr eshold v alue of a condition indicat or that detects failur e Pr edictiv e Maintenance T oolbo x™ pr o vides models for estimating RUL fr om each type of data. Lif etime Data Pr opor tional hazar d models and pr obability distributions of component failur e times ar e used t o estimate RUL fr om lif etime data. A simple example is estimating the dischar ge time of a batter y based on past dischar ge times and co v ariates, such as envir onmental temper atur e and load. The sur viv al function plot in Figur e 1 shows the pr obability that a batter y will fail based on how long it has been in oper ation. The plot shows, for example, that if the batter y is in oper ation for 75 cy cles, it has a 90% chance of being at the end of its lif etime. Run-t o-F ailur e Data If y ou ha v e a database of run-t o-failur e data fr om similar components or diff er ent components showing similar beha vior , y ou can estimate RUL using similarity methods. These methods captur e degr adation pr o \u0000 les and compar e them with new data coming in fr om the machine t o determine which pr o \u0000 le the data matches most closely . In Figur e 2, the degr adation pr o \u0000 les of hist orical run-t o-failur e data sets fr om an engine ar e shown in blue and the curr ent data fr om the engine is shown in r ed. Based on a distribution of the near est hist orical pr o \u0000 les, the RUL is estimated t o be ar ound 65 cy cles.  9:34 Learn about the most common RUL estimat or models: similarity , sur viv al, and degr adation.

This can mean run-t o- failur e data or lif etime data is not a v ailable. Howe v er , y ou lik ely ha v e information on pr escribed thr eshold v alues—for example, the temper atur e of a liquid in a pump cannot ex ceed 160 ˚F (71 ˚C ) and the pr essur e must be under 2,200 psi (155 bar). With this thr eshold information, y ou can \u0000 t degr adation models t o condition indicat ors extr acted fr om sensor data, which change linearly or exponentially o v er time. These degr adation models estimate RUL b y pr edicting when the condition indicat or will cr oss the thr eshold. The y can also be used with a fused condition indicat or that incorpor ates information fr om mor e than one sensor using techniques such as principal component analysis. Figur e 3 shows an exponential degr adation model that tr acks failur e in a high-speed bearing used in a wind turbine. The condition indicat or is shown in blue. The degr adation model pr edicts that the bearing will cr oss the thr eshold v alue in appr o ximately 9.5 da ys. The r egion shaded in r ed r epr esents the con \u0000 dence bounds for this pr ediction. Once y ou ha v e designed an RUL model based on the data y ou ha v e a v ailable, y ou can integr ate it int o dashboar ds used b y oper at ors or alarm systems monit or ed b y maintenance teams. T eams can then r espond t o changes in equipment health quickly and e \u0000 ciently , and without aff ecting oper ations.  Figur e 2. Degr adation pr o \u0000 les (blue) based on run- t o-failur e data. The distribution of the stars (endpoints) of the near est blue cur v es giv es an RUL of 65 cy cles. ( )See example Figur e 3. Degr adation model for a high-speed bearing.
