But that’s di\u0000erent from turning out voters. November 27, 2024 7 min 1497 Column by Philip Bump Victory has a thousand fathers, as they say, while defeat is an orphan. But an electoral defeat goes further: Not only is it an orphan, but a thousand people quickly step up to deny paternity. At least, that’s what happens when Democratic candidates lose. And Vice President Kamala Harris’s loss earlier this month has triggered a flood of analyses in which people who advocate a particular approach criticize Harris’s campaign for not taking that approach or not taking that approach enough. It is far, far easier to say how someone could have won than it is to actually win. On Monday, the Guardian’s Astra Taylor presented an analysis of the 2024 outcome that faulted Democrats for dismissing the right’s approach to voter outreach. “Democrats should stop mocking Trump’s ground game and start learning from it,” the article is titled. In it, various local organizers explain how the Harris campaign would have been better served by diverting resources from volunteer door-knocking and toward long-term organizing. It’s a compelling message for Democrats who both feel frustrated with Donald Trump’s victory and with the inroads Trump and his party seem to have made with long-standing Democratic constituencies. It’s also counterintuitive, which always holds some appeal: Is everything the Democrats know about campaigning wrong? No. While there would almost certainly be value in an effort by Democrats to build sustained outreach efforts in communities, there is little reason to think that this is what led to Trump’s victory. What’s more, that isn’t the same as a campaign ground game — and Harris’s ground game, unlike Trump’s, was robust and effective.

Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more. We’re blurring a lot of terms here, so let’s disentangle a bit. “Ground game” is a general term used to describe direct, person-to-person contact. There are usually two phases to it during a political campaign. Before voting begins, it involves persuading voters who might be interested in voting for your candidate and identifying voters who are. Once voting starts, it’s about getting those supportive voters to the polls. Taylor’s piece begins by dismissing Democrats’ insistence that Trump’s ground game — here referring to that latter component — was ineffective. If “that’s true,” she writes, “why did Trump succeed where Harris failed?” Well, the simple answer is that Trump benefited from the political pendulum swinging back to the right after it swung to the left in 2020. That swing was accelerated by inflation, which contributed to a global backlash against incumbent parties. It wasn’t because voter-turnout efforts were unimportant or ineffective. In fact, the available data suggests that Harris’s efforts were effective in the seven states identified before Election Day as being up for grabs. The chart below shows how much each state swung to the right relative to 2020. The states closest to the middle dividing line, the ones with the closest margins in 2024, showed more subtle rightward shifts. Harris got more votes in five states than Joe Biden did in 2020, as of this writing. Four were swing states. On average, the margin in non-swing states that voted for Harris shifted five points to Trump relative to 2020. In non- swing states that backed Trump, the shift was four points. In swing states, it was three points. In all seven swing states, Trump also outperformed his 2020 numbers, as he did in 37 states overall. Across those swing states, he earned 6 percent more votes than he did in 2020, a bigger jump than the 2 percent he gained in states Harris won and the 4 percent improvement he saw in non-swing states he won. But while Harris received 12 percent fewer votes in states she won (as of this writing) than Biden did four years ago and 8 percent fewer in non- swing states that Trump won, she received almost the same number of votes in those swing states that Biden did. None of this proves that Harris’s efforts on the ground were the difference maker. But it does suggest that she did better in those targeted swing states than in other places. Maybe it was the ads. Maybe it was something else. But it wasn’t because of Trump’s new-model ground game — which, in Taylor’s articulation, centered on “use of ‘untraditional’ and ‘micro-targeted’ strategies aimed at reaching low- and mid-propensity voters who didn’t fit the usual Republican profile, including Latinos, Black men, and Asian and Arab Americans.” That’s not a ground game. That’s just using different modes of persuasion. If we want to talk about how Democrats can be better at persuading uninterested voters, sure. But that’s a different discussion. Never mind, of course, that there’s not much evidence that these newfangled strategies actually had much effect. What’s the evidence that the significant shift among Hispanics stems from outreach groups engaging those voters over a period of months? It’s just assumed — just as it is assumed that engaging these groups generally will yield the specific benefit of reaching registered voters and compelling them to vote. The difference in utility between putting up a billboard and driving a voter to the polls is important! To that point: What’s the evidence for Black voters being subtly compelled to come out and vote for Trump? Exit polls show that Black voters made up less of the electorate in 2024 than in 2020, an election in which more votes were cast. They backed Harris by nearly an equivalent margin. If you want to argue that Trump’s campaign persuaded Black voters to stay home, fine — but that’s not the argument being made. The argument being made is, instead, that Trump has invested in systems to engage people outside the electoral context. That’s what the organizers who spoke to Taylor advocate: more investment in groups like theirs to bolster engagement with the left over the long run. And, again, it’s hard to see how that would hurt. But we’re conflating different things. The Harris campaign could not have stood up some long-term engagement effort; it started in late July! The campaign did what campaigns can do, which is contact and identify voters and then turn them out. The party could do this, sure, but that has nothing to do with what Harris should or could have done. While the specific examples of Republican outreach identified in Taylor’s piece include efforts funded by outside conservative groups, it is true that Trump has created a community that Harris didn’t. That’s in part because he has been running for president for the better part of a decade, which she hadn’t been. The last Democratic presidential candidate who had a base of enthusiastic support that is at all comparable to what surrounds Trump was Barack Obama. And he actually launched an effort to convert that enthusiasm into a permanent organizing effort, engaging people outside the context of electoral politics. It was called Organizing for America, and it evaporated fairly quickly. None of this is to say that Harris’s campaign was flawless or that Trump’s was fatally flawed. It isn’t to say that a long-term organizing effort by Democrats that is centered on being useful to voters outside the months before an election wouldn’t be beneficial. It is, instead, to say that the problem with Harris’s campaign wasn’t that she did typical campaign outreach. Her loss wasn’t because Trump invented some new model of voter turnout that Democrats must replicate. If your interest is in seeing Democrats win elections in the future, suggesting that the Trump campaign’s nebulous internet-ad/text- message/stay-at-home turnout effort is something to emulate is deeply risky advice.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
