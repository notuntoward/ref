December 3, 2024 9 min 4523 Some of Vice President Kamala Harris’s top advisers spoke to “Pod Save America” in an interview that aired last week. Like the campaign they ran, the interview was unconvincing and uninspiring. Here are some of the lowlights: They didn’t admit mistakes. In a discussion that lasted more than an hour, the staffers (campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks and advisers Stephanie Cutter and David Plouffe) kept saying they weren’t making excuses or blaming others — while doing both. Popular podcasts such as “Hot Ones” wouldn’t have the vice president on because the shows wanted to avoid politics, according to Harris’s aides. There weren’t Democratic super PACs running tons of commercials in the early stages of the campaign. Activists in the party put too many demands on the campaign. What the four never did is directly admit any major mistakes they made. “We should have really pushed Harris to distance herself from President Biden”; “Maybe we spent too much time in Arizona” (Harris lost there by 6 percentage points); “We should have had a Palestinian speaker at the Democratic National Convention.” There were no blunt statements like that. Instead, the staffers repeatedly defended their work by noting that Harris lost by less in the seven swing states she campaigned in compared with the rest of the country. That does suggest the campaign was somewhat effective. But an alternative explanation is that people in swing states turned out at high rates because they knew their votes really mattered — and the Harris campaign added little even in the places where it invested most of its time and resources.

See my 2024 Newsprint Either way, being closer in swing states compared with the rest of the country doesn’t matter. A campaign whose entire mission was to win swing states lost all seven despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars in them! Blaming everything on factors outside of their control and taking no real responsibility is disappointing. Do these people really believe they could not have spent any of the $1 billion the Harris campaign raised in a better way? “107 days” and “headwinds” The staffers invoke these terms over and over. The headwinds they were referring to are Biden’s dismal poll numbers and broader voter frustrations, particularly about the economy. After Biden dropped out, there were 107 days before Election Day. Their argument is that Harris was essentially doomed because of Biden’s unpopularity and how the vice president became the presumptive Democratic nominee later in the election cycle than is typical. But the idea that a candidate, particularly the well-known sitting vice president, needs five or six months to make their case to voters is ludicrous. The recent general election campaign in Great Britain was fewer than 60 days. In fact, being able to replace Biden with Harris in late July actually provided many advantages for Democrats. They were able to move on from Biden without having a primary that might have permanently divided the party’s centrist and progressive wings, and almost certainly would have left the winner scarred by attacks from intraparty rivals that Donald Trump could have used in the general election. Also, the challenges faced by the Harris campaign might have been less significant if these very strategists had taken different actions before July 2024. Polls since early 2022 showed that voters were leery of a second Biden term. Prominent commentators such as my colleague David Ignatius called for the president to stand down in 2023. David Axelrod, who was one of the two top advisers on Barack Obama’s 2008 run, expressed concerns about Biden’s viability. But the other one-time top Obama adviser, Plouffe, did not publicly discourage Biden from running for reelection. Plouffe and Cutter, who was deputy campaign manager for Obama in 2012, are the kind of major figures in the party who could have helped push Biden out earlier, making sure another candidate had more than 107 days. O’Malley Dillon deserves particular criticism here. She helped create the headwinds she now claims were insurmountable. She was one of Biden’s top political advisers in the White House from 2021 to 2023, as the president’s poll numbers collapsed but he continued to insist on running for a second term. Early in 2024, she left the White House to run his campaign. It is hard to imagine that a person in such senior roles in Biden’s orbit was totally unaware of the decline in the president’s ability to speak in complete sentences that became clear to the nation and the world in the June 27 debate. But O’Malley Dillon repeatedly cast Biden as a strong candidate even after the debate. If her prior roles effectively required her to spin about Biden, she can certainly come clean now. “Vice presidents stick by their presidents,” said Cutter, who was a top Harris communications adviser.

When pressed on why Harris refused to distance herself from the very unpopular president, the staffers alternated between two responses. First, they subtly blamed Harris, suggesting the candidate herself was not willing to criticize the president. This might be true. But one of the most important parts of a political consultant’s job is to push the candidate to do things that they may not like but are electorally necessary. Second, the advisers suggested that there is some kind of code against vice presidents ever attacking presidents that Harris could not break. Surely keeping a radical person such as Trump out of the White House would have been worth breaking with politeness and norms! Also, this is not a real precedent. During their presidential campaigns, Hubert Humphrey (1968) and Al Gore (2000) both criticized the men (Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton) that they were serving under. They lost, but I don’t think that’s because they broke with the incumbent presidents. “She wasn’t willing to … change that precedent for … the future president/vice-presidential partnership,” said Cutter. She added, “It would mean a whole different set of problems, as if we don’t have enough problems in our democracy right now.” Seriously? I would not rank a lack of vice-presidential loyalty to presidents as one of the top 100 problems with American democracy, and I doubt anyone else besides Cutter would either. “Being up against a narrative that we weren’t doing anything or we were afraid to have interviews is completely bulls--- and also … took hold a little bit,” campaign chair O’Malley Dillon said. In her first month as a candidate, Harris didn’t do any formal interviews and answered very few questions from the reporters traveling with her. This wasn’t some “narrative”; it was the truth. If the campaign didn’t want the idea that Harris was wary of questions to take hold, it should have had her do more interviews. Back in August, Harris staffers argued they were in an early phase of her candidacy, where talking to the press was not that important. It’s fine to make that decision. But be prepared to deal with the consequences. “It’s really hard for Democrats to win battleground states. … Let’s look at Pennsylvania. Twenty-five percent of the electorate is liberal, roughly. Thirty-four percent is conservative. By the way, in most battleground states, that conservative number is over 40,” said Plouffe, who was a senior adviser. Democrats won the races for governor and most other state-based offices in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in 2022. They won the gubernatorial race and most other statewide offices in North Carolina this year. Democratic U.S. Senate candidates won this year in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin. The only swing state Democrats lost at the Senate level was Pennsylvania. Democrats are doing pretty well in battleground states. It’s the Kamala Harris campaign that Plouffe helped run that went 0 for 7. Your Newsprint is here. Discover your year in news with \u0000e Washington Post. See stats and reveal your reader type. Also, I was flabbergasted that Plouffe spoke in such overly simplistic terms about political ideology. While voters might describe themselves as liberal, moderate or conservative, many political scientists say Americans often don’t really understand these terms or the policies that underlie them. Voters who describe themselves as moderate might have a mix of views: some conservative, some liberal, many fairly unformed. The question for a Democratic presidential campaign isn’t whether to have liberal positions on every issue. No one is arguing Harris would have won by calling for open borders. The question is how best to appeal to these self- described moderates and other undecided voters. The days Harris spent campaigning with former congresswoman Liz Cheney, in my view, would have been better used giving speeches attacking companies for ripping off consumers. Perhaps Plouffe saw more value in Cheney’s campaigning. But the general ideology of Pennsylvania’s electorate isn’t much of a guide to how to campaign effectively there. In Kentucky, which is way more conservative than Pennsylvania, Gov. Andy Beshear won reelection last year while defending his support of abortion and transgender rights. Overall, we have the story of a campaign leadership team that had more than $1 billion and a scandal-plagued, unpopular opponent, lost every swing state and the popular vote (for the first time in 20 years for the Democrats), and then almost entirely absolved itself of any responsibility for the defeat. I’m grateful Harris’s staffers did this interview — so everyone can see how badly the Democratic Party needs new political strategists. Your Newsprint is here.
