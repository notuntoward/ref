PT takes advantage of diversiﬁed forecast assets: when one of the assets shows prediction errors, these are offset by another asset. After testing with data from Spain and Brazil, results show that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for predictions using DL is 6.89% and for the proposed integration (called PrevPT) is 5.36% concerning data from Spain. For the data from Brazil, MAPE for predictions using DL is 6.08% and 4.52% for PrevPT. In both cases, DL and PrevPT results are better than the other techniques being used. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, photovoltaic (PV) power has increased steadily in several countries over the past few years, thus becoming an important component for sustainable development [1]. The inter- mittency of PV electricity production needs to be addressed to ensure reliable and proper grid operation [2,3]. Consequently, additional costs arise for leveling out unforeseen ﬂuctuations in electricity production [4e6]. Studies show that a 25% improvement in PV power output forecast accuracy can lead to a reduction of 1.56% (US$ 46.5 million) in the net generation cost [7]. Hence, solar forecasting is an important area with a great value to grid integration and solar power plant management [8,9]. Energy traders in international energy exchange markets, utilities/Trans- mission System Operators (TSOs) with their network dispatchers, and also conventional power plant operators (who provide oper- ating reserve) require reliable information about the electricity available in the system in the next few minutes, hours, or days [10]. The performances of forecast models are affected by many ele- ments of uncertainties, and it is not always clear how single choices Abbreviations: Aerosol Optical Depth, (AOD); Artiﬁcial Intelligence, (AI); Artiﬁcial Neural Networks, (ANNs); coefﬁcient of determination, (R2); Coordination for higher Education Staff Development, (CAPES); Deep Learning, (DL); Forecast based on Portfolio Theory, (PrevPT); Institute for Energy and Transport, (IET); Long Short-Term Memory, (LSTM); Mean Absolute Error, (MAE); Mean Absolute Percentage Error, (MAPE); Mean Percentage Error, (MPE); Multilayer Perceptron, (MLP); National Council for Scientiﬁc and Technological Development, (CNPq); National Institute of Meteorology, (INMET); Photovoltaic, (PV); Photovoltaic Geographical Information System, (PVGIS); Portfolio Theory, (PT); Radial Basis Function, (RBF); Recurrent Neural Network, (RNN); Root Mean Squared Error, (RMSE); Statistical Evaluation, (SE); Support Vector Machine, (SVM); Support Vector Regression, (SVR); Transmission System Operators, (TSOs). * Corresponding author.

Energy 195 (2020) 117016 (e.g., the choice of a speciﬁc prediction methodology over another) or different factors (e.g., meteorological forecasting errors) contribute to the ﬁnal prediction error [11]. The forecasting methods can broadly be categorized into Arti- ﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and conventional methods. Conventional methods include the use of stochastic time series and regression- based approaches to predict energy. The conventional methods have been widely used in previous works and are capable of yielding better results while solving linear problems, while AI methods work well with non-linear outputs [12e15], which is the case of solar irradiance [16]. In the last decades, several lines of research on AI applications have been found in the solar resource forecast sector. Among the AI methods that seek solving the problem of renewable energy fore- casting, the use of Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) must be highlighted [17]. For example, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to solar forecast was used in Refs. [18e20], while Radial Basis Function (RBF) was used in Refs. [21,22]. Another useful AI methodology is the Support Vector Machines (SVM) due to the strong theoretical base and high generalization capacity. Since then, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) has been developed to work with pre- dictions [23]. The SVR use for solar forecast can be found in Refs. [24e26]. One of the emerging themes in the AI ﬁeld is Deep Learning (DL), a sub-category of machine learning that relates to DL oppor- tunities with a capacity for improvement over other AI methods. Notably, deep neural network architectures provide capabilities to learn hierarchical features from the data set while providing a more efﬁcient representation than shallow models and improving generalization [12,27e31]. In Ref. [28], a DL method is employed for estimating the solar radiation over 30 stations in Turkey. As a conclusion, DL model yields very precise and comparable results for estimating daily global solar radiation. The short-term solar power forecast with DL is explored in Ref. [30], which proposes the use of this methodology to predict PV output 15 min earlier. Table 1 summarizes the performance data of the techniques. It is worth mentioning that the different methodologies are used with different types of Statistical Evaluation (SE) and with different forecasting horizons. The SEs are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Percentage Error (MPE) and coefﬁcient of determi- nation (R2). Considering the increasing use of PV plants worldwide, this paper explores the use of AI techniques, such as MLP, RBF, SVR and DL, as a solar prediction resource. These techniques were chosen after a vast bibliographical survey, which conﬁrmed that MLP, RBF and SVR are highly consolidated, with good results in the area of solar irradiance predictability; DL is characterized as a new trend, having an ability to generalize. Hence, the four techniques can be compared and the DL improvement ability can be veriﬁed. In addition to the application and comparison of the above- mentioned solar forecasting techniques, a new strategy of inte- grating these techniques is herein proposed in order to reduce forecasting errors and to compare and prove the improvement of forecasting results of techniques working together. The proposed integration, herein called Forecast based on Portfolio Theory (PrevPT), uses as fundament the Portfolio Theory (PT). PT has the ultimate goal of providing a method to deﬁne the penetration percentage of each asset in order to increase ﬁnancial returns. Hence, PT proposes to achieve the same proﬁts, or greater proﬁts, by combining investment assets [4,32]. The proposed PrevPT develops a new AI integration topology based on adaptive structural use and also adaptive weights of the MLP, RBF, SVR and DL, integrating them through the interconnec- tion points deﬁned by this adaptation in order to obtain smaller forecast errors. With the diversiﬁcation of forecast assets, it is ex- pected that when one of the assets obtains negative signal pre- diction errors, another, or other assets, complement with a counter- sign value, so that there is a complete or partial error cancellation. Over the past few decades, several research lines have been found about PT applications in the energy planning sector as well as the design of energy security policies and analysis of investment in renewable power generation [4,33e38], although, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no research about the use of PT for the inte- gration of different forecasting techniques of intermittent energy resources was found. PrevPT, as a strategy developed herein to improve the predictability of intermittent energy resources with AI integration, is an innovative contribution. PrevPT is proposed as a contribution with beneﬁcial character- istics in comparison to other integration techniques, such as: sim- ple implementation and low computational cost due to the use of known statistical tools, which are improvements with regard to techniques such as Bayesian Model Averaging and Decision Trees, which use their own complex equations [39]; ability to improve the results in relation to isolated techniques, besides applying different weights according to asset performance, thus enhancing the Equal Weights technique [40]. As a methodology application, solar irradiation data and ambient temperature from Fortaleza/Brazil (latitude: \u000103\u0003430, longitude: \u000138\u0003320, elevation: 21 m (68.90 ft)) and from Algeciras/ Spain (latitude: 36\u0003130, longitude: \u00015\u000345’, elevation: 13 m (42.65 ft)) are used. 2. Methodology 2.1. Data collection To better understand solar resource behavior, solar irradiance and ambient temperature data from Algeciras, Spain and from Fortaleza, Brazil are considered. Irradiance and ambient tempera- ture data from Spain is obtained using the Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS) of the European Com- mission/Institute for Energy and Transport (IET). Solar irradiance and temperature data are collected and stored in electronic spreadsheets in 1-h intervals. Data collection period is from January 2007 to December 2016, totaling ten years of collection and resulting in 87,672 solar irradiance and ambient temperature measurements. For the AI training, 8 years of all collected data are used (2921 days; 70,128 measurements). In Brazil, irradiance data is measured by the Federal University of Cear\u0001a (UFC) using a pyranometer (NRG Systems, LI-200SZ); ambient temperature data is obtained using a temperature sensor Table 1 Comparison of AI used for solar forecast.

Solar irradiance and temperature data are collected and stored in electronic spreadsheets in 10-min in- tervals; stored values are obtained by calculating arithmetic aver- ages of data processed every 2 s. Data collection period is from May 2003 to April 2005, totaling two years of collection and resulting in 61,404 solar irradiance and ambient temperature measurements, recorded daily from 05:00 a.m. to 06:00 p.m. For the AI training, 70% of all collected data are used (512 days; 43,008 measurements). 2.2. Data processing Data were processed in order to identify outliers, which were determined using ambient temperature and solar irradiance at the study site. The data used for the determination of the upper and lower limits in Fortaleza and in Algeciras came from the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) and from the European Com- mission/IET, respectively. In all cases, outliers were subsequently replaced by the values of previous measurements showing no system failure. 2.3. MLP MLP consists of a neural network organized in layers. Input layer refers to the data; output layer; and hidden layers (intermediate) are made up of neurons capable of processing data, resulting in outputs assigned through inputs excitations and respective weights. Fig. 1 shows a multi-layered network having three neu- rons in the input layer, two neurons in the hidden layer and one in the output layer. X0, X1 and X2 represent the input variables, wi is weight be- tween layers and y is the MLP output. The algorithm used for ANN training is Backpropagation, a generalization of the Widrow & Hoff delta rule for Adaline training. The name “backpropagation” is used because error propagation occurs in the reverse direction to the input signal. Widrow & Hoff Delta Rule generalization is used to adjust the weights and bias of the MLP network in order to mini- mize the error between the network output and the desired output [23]. Among the activation functions of the neurons, the activation function used for both the hidden neurons layer and the output layer was the logistic sigmoid, which generates values ranging 0 to 1. Equation (1) represents the function and its derivative, where yj is the neuron output of the neuron and uj is the weighted sum of all inputs. yj ¼ 1 1 þ exp\u0001 \u0001 uj\u0003 (1) The weights update of both the hidden and the output layer is given by equations (2) and (3), where w is the weight, a is the learning rate arbitrated by the programmer, d is the sensitivity and b is the bias. wðtþ1Þ ¼ wðtÞ þ adyiðtÞ (2) bðtþ1Þ ¼ bðtÞ \u0001 ad (3) 2.4. RBF RBF is an ANN with multiple layers, each with different activ- ities. The input layer is the ANN connection point with the data environment to be processed. The second layer is a single layer, which applies a nonlinear transformation of the input space to a representation in the space generated by the neuron activations of the hidden layer. The third layer is the ANN output. RBF ANN structure is illustrated in Fig. 2, where X0, X1 and X2 represent the input variables, f1 and f2 are the intermediate neurons, where each neuron has a radial base function, y is the neuron that represents the ANN output, and wi is the weight of the connections between intermediate and output layer. This ANN uses activation functions with local receptive ﬁelds, as previously mentioned [21]. Equations (4) and (5) were considered using the Gaussian function, where f is the output of each neuron of the hidden layer, r is the difference between the input x and the center t, and s is the measure of the curve scattering. f ¼ exp\u0004 \u0001 r2 2s2 \u0005 (4) r ¼ jjx \u0001 tjj (5) RBF output is formed by a single linear neuron, where the sum of each output of the hidden layer neurons is weighted by their respective weights, according to (6), where y is the output of ANN and w the weight. y ¼ X wjfj (6) 2.5. SVR The support vector machine (SVM) was developed by Vapnik in 1995 to solve the classiﬁcation problem. This method was extended to the regression domain and prediction problems, thus being called SVR [23]. SVR structure is illustrated in Fig. 3, where X0, X1 and X2 represent the input variables, Kðx; x1Þ and Kðx; x2Þ are the interme- diate neurons, y is the neuron that represents the AI output, and the parameters wi are the weights of the connections between inter- mediate and output layer. The kernel Kðx; x’Þ, is found through equation (7). Where, x is the input vector and s is the kernel parameter which deﬁnes the structure of the high dimensional feature space. Fig. 2.

DL DL algorithms are machine learning methods based on distrib- uted representations. DL attempts to learn high-level features in data by using structures made up of multiple non-linear trans- formations [41]. For producing solar irradiance predictions, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used [42], which is an artiﬁcial Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture in the ﬁeld of DL [43]. LSTMs have an advantage over conventional ANNs because of their property of selectively remembering patterns for long durations of time, as shown in the process of the LSTM model with ﬁve layers (input layer, hidden layer, context layer, forget layer, and output layer) in Fig. 4. Xt is the input of the LSTM; in the case of solar predictability, a window of historical data of solar irradiance and ambient tem- perature collected at the mentioned sites, s is a sigmoidal function, f is a hyperbolic function and the subscripts ðf ; i; z; oÞ represent the forget layer, the output and the state input for the next stage. Yt is the output of the LSTM, which is represented by the equation (9), where f is the activation function for each stage, W refers to the weights of each stage (Wf ; Wi; Wz; W0Þ; U also the weight of each stage (Uf ; Ui; Uz; U0Þ and b is the bias of each stage (bf ; bi; bz; b0Þ.

Fine adjustments Fine adjustments were developed using the increment method to deﬁne the amount of AIs inputs and hidden processing units. Hence, with each increase in the number of entries, starting from 1, the AIs were retrained. The algorithm found the validation value for current situation and stored it in a vector. After the limit of in- crements was reached, the reﬁner developed found the optimal Fig. 5. Efﬁcient frontier. Fig. 3. SVR structure. Fig. 4. Process of the LSTM model with ﬁve layers. M.A.F.B. Lima et al. / Energy 195 (2020) 1170164 point, i.e., the ideal amount of system entries that gives a smaller amount of errors. This methodology is repeated for the four AIs used in the present research for solar forecasting. The algorithm is also applied for the reﬁnement of the number of hidden layer processing units of MLP, RBF and DL. For SVR, the training structure itself is capable of deﬁning the amount of support vectors in the hidden layer. The AI reﬁnement algorithm is deﬁned in (12).

Prediction errors To validate the AI results, solar irradiance and temperature data reserved for the test period are used to characterize the operation of forecasting techniques and their respective solar resource fore- casting capabilities. By comparing AI forecasting results and data collected in the same period, the percentage of errors can be calculated. Solar prediction errors can be found at different times of day, i.e., at different levels of solar resource availability [4]. Hence, to adjust forecast errors and, at the same time, take into account the amplitude of solar resource availability, a ﬁlter called Impact Factor is applied, according to (13) and (14). Dp is the pre- dicted data, Dm is the measured data, Mr represents the highest value of the resource under investigation in the period and Fi is the Factor Impact [4].

PrevPT Asset diversiﬁcation of an investment, when measured by the correlation coefﬁcient, can be found by using the (15), in which pxy is the correlation coefﬁcient between the assets x and y; Covðy; xÞ is the covariance between x and y; sx is the standard deviation of asset x; and sy is the standard deviation of asset y. pxy ¼ Covðy; xÞ sx,sy (15) Covariance between x and y is determined by (16), in which xi represents the asset values of x; x is the average value of asset x; yi is the asset values of y; y is the average value of asset y; and n is the amount of asset values. Covðy; xÞ¼ Pn i¼1Unsupported ðxi \u0001 xÞ:ðyi \u0001 yÞ n (16) Portfolio risk can be determined by a statistical tool called standard deviation, which reveals the probability of a given result. In order to deﬁne the percentage of each asset and thereby reduce forecasting errors, it is necessary to set up an Efﬁcient Frontier chart. Those boundaries are lines formed by the proportion of different assets in a portfolio, thus representing graphically how a particular return can promote the lowest possible risk [4]. Fig. 5 shows the hypothetical situation of a diversiﬁed application using assets A and B as an example of the risk-return analysis curve (Efﬁcient Frontier). PrevPT structure is shown in Fig. 6, showing the use of the MLP, RBF, SVR and DL structures and their integration through the connection points (p11 to p16). In a later layer, PrevPT creates all possible combinations between the connections of the previous layer, and in its self-adaptive structure characteristic, it chooses the three best combinations from the measurement of their respective MAPEs. In this step, the combinations are called p1 to p3. In the PrevPT output, ie p, the two best ones between p1 to p3 are chosen to format a response of the algorithm. After the training, in the testing stage, PrevPT structure can be simpliﬁed according to Fig. 7 by assigning ﬁnal weights for the interconnection of forecasting techniques. According to the topology, PrevPT develops parallel integration of techniques. The data processing steps performed by PrevPT are presented in Fig. 8 and are divided into: data collection, application of predictability techniques (MLP, RBF, SVM and DL), calculation and analysis of prediction errors, design of efﬁcient frontiers for integration (several layers); presentation of results. The weights are deﬁned based on data collected from each study site, as well as the ability of each technique to accurately predict the solar availability value of each site. Hence, to obtain the ideal combination and deﬁne the percentage of each forecasting asset, the technique is simply retrained with data from the new location Fig. 6. PrevPT structure. Fig. 7.

Finally, it is worth noting that the proposed methodology can be applied to any technology that requires solar resource forecasting to deﬁne the energy available in the system. For example, grid- connected photovoltaic plants, off-grid photovoltaic powered wa- ter pumping systems, concentrated solar power units, amongst others. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Characteristics of the collected data 10 years of collected data were used in Spain. They are consec- utive data and all weather conditions in the period (including rainy and cloudy days) are considered. It is noteworthy that, at the place of measurement of the Spanish data, it does not snow, and this issue was not observed, but all four year seasons, different days, days with more or less solar availability are observed. For Brazil, consecutive data from 2 years of collected data were used, also experiencing all the climatic conditions in the period. Therefore, the techniques were evaluated with different climates and weather conditions in Spain and Brazil in order to conclude the best tech- nique under two different climatic conditions, with different solar resource availability and different locations. During data collection, Spain showed an average daily solar irradiation of 5.32 kW h/m2, variance of 941.89 kW/m2 and stan- dard deviation of 970.51 W/m2, while in Brazil the average daily irradiation was 6.73 kW h/m2, a variance of 101.33 kW/m2 and standard deviation of 318.33 W/m2. 3.2. Forecasting errors in Spain Fig. 9 shows 6 days of solar irradiance in Spain in January 2007 to exemplify sudden ﬂuctuations during measurements as a consequence of cloud cover. The predictive errors of the Spanish solar resource were found using PrevPT. Fig. 10 shows the prediction error behavior for a 300 small sample window extracted from the MLP, RBF, SVR and DL forecasts (January 1ST, 2015 to January 19TH, 2015). It can be seen in Fig. 10 that the forecasting errors of each technique were some- times of opposite signal to the other techniques, which highlights that this characteristic is beneﬁcial for the integration of the fore- casting assets with the PrevPT, since theory achieves error cancel- lation through the ideal combination of predictors. It can also be observed that, when one of the forecasting techniques had a high error rate, the other errors were signiﬁcantly lower. As an example of this, instant 50 of the displayed window, where MLP had a 42.46% error, while RBF had a 3.83% error, SVR with 3.87% and Deep Learning \u00010.76% error. The highest solar irradiance value predicted by MLP is 1075.5 W/ Fig. 9. Solar irradiance data in January 2007, Algeciras, Spain. Fig. 10. Forecast errors in January 2015, Algeciras, Spain. M.A.F.B. Lima et al. / Energy 195 (2020) 117016 7 m2; the highest value predicted by RBF is 1106.8 W/m2; the highest value predicted by SVR is 1171.8 W/m2; and the highest value predicted by DL is 1117.3 W/m2. The highest irradiance value collected during the period was 1106.83 W/m2. For the MLP Back- propagation, 32.76% of the forecasts underestimates solar energy availability, 25.03% produces error 0 (zero) and 42.21% over- estimates solar resource. The highest negative error is \u000169.52%, while the highest positive error is 81.77%; 71.29% of the predictions show forecasting errors between \u000110% and 10%. Average fore- casting error is 1.29% and MAPE for this ANN is 8.06%. For RBF, 21.13% of the forecasts underestimates solar energy availability, 25.02% produces error 0 (zero) and 53.85% of the pre- dictions overestimates solar resource. The highest negative error is \u000157.45%, while the highest positive one is 56.96%. 73.27% of the predictions show forecasting errors between \u000110% and 10%. Average prediction error is 2.76% and MAPE for this ANN is 7.16%. For SVR, 41.78% of the forecasts underestimates solar energy availability, 25.01% produces error 0 (zero) and 33.21% of the pre- dictions overestimates solar resource. The highest negative error is \u000185.49%, while the highest positive one is 75.77%. 73.71% of the predictions show forecasting errors between \u000110% and 10%. Average prediction error is \u00010.89% and MAPE for this ANN is 8.34%. For DL, 44.26% of the forecasts underestimate solar energy availability, 25.02% produces error 0 (zero) and 30.72% of the pre- dictions overestimate solar resource. The highest negative error is \u000163.52%, while the highest positive one is 72.93%. 75.87% of the predictions show forecasting errors between \u000110% and 10%. Average prediction error is 0.36% and MAPE for this ANN is 6.89%. The MAPE presented by the four prediction techniques represents the superiority of DL compared to other solar resource forecasting strategies. Fig. 11 shows the boxplot to represent the variation of observed and forecast data by the proposed AI techniques. The interquartile range limits (50% of the data presented) was 27.07 W/m2 to 934.47 W/m2 for MLP; 165.86 W/m2 to 975.16 W/m2 for RBF; 70.5 W/m2 to 915.45 W/m2 for SVR; 28.76 W/m2 to 903.17 W/m2 for DL; and 0 W/m2 to 947.5 W/m2 for the data collected in the trial period. As can be seen, the best results were achieved by DL. SVR also obtained good results, although with some negative values, which is impossible to happen. 3.3. Integration of techniques in Spain For designing the Efﬁcient Frontier, a total of 21 combinations of each connection is used according to the proposed topology, each with different weighting, seeking the lowest risk of forecast errors. The combinations are made from 100% of asset A and 0% of asset B up to 0% of asset A and 100% of asset B. Changes in the percentages with steps are made every 5%, which generates the 21 combina- tions above. To illustrate this, in connection p11, which combines RBF and DL for example: 21 combinations are assembled with different percentage levels of each AI used, ranging from 100% forecast RBF usage and 0% DL usage, later 95% RBF and 5% DL, until 0% RBF forecast usage and 100% DL usage is achieved. The risk and the prediction error of the combination for efﬁcient frontier plot- ting are found at each combination. After the integrations, pre- dictability error risks and predictability errors for each combination are found. Fig. 12, Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 show the Efﬁcient Frontiers of PrevPT for the Spanish data. The ﬁrst layer of PrevPT is deﬁned with connection p11 (55% RBF - 45% DL), connection p12 (45% MLP e 55% DL) and connection p13 (40% MLP e 60% RBF). The second layer is deﬁned with connection p 1 (60%e p11 40% p 12) and connection p 2 (55%e p11 45% p13Þ. PrevPT output is deﬁned as 50% p 1 and 50% p2. Efﬁcient Frontier results show that the optimal portfolio, i. e., the combination with best predictability results, is 18% MLP, 45.12% RBF, 0% SVR and 36.88% DL. This result is achieved by using the lowest standard deviation found, i. e., the combination, for the generated portfolio, with results that have the least chance of showing erratic behavior compared to other study data. PrevPT, in its characteristic of self-adaptive structure, found the best Fig. 11. Observed and forecast data boxplot for Algeciras, Spain. Fig. 12. Developed efﬁcient frontiers (ﬁrst layer). M.A.F.B.

The comparison between the distribution of prediction errors is shown in Fig. 16. For PrevPT, 39.76% of the forecasts underestimate and 58.84% overestimates solar resource. The highest negative error is \u000134.47%, while the highest positive one is 38.16%. 83.42% of the predictions show forecasting errors between \u000110% and 10%. Average fore- casting error is 1.61% and MAPE is 5.36%, which deﬁnes integration methodology as an improvement of individual AI results, since MLP MAPE is 8.06%, RBF MAPE is 7.16%, SVR MAPE is 8.34% and DL MAPE is 6.69%. Table 2 compares individual AI results, partial and ﬁnal integrations made by PrevPT for the Spanish data. The comparison uses the same database, horizons and forecast period, in order to generate an SE of the forecasting techniques using the MAPE, MPE and Range \u000110 (%) to 10 (%). In the city of Algeciras, the climate is well deﬁned with four seasons (winter, spring, summer, autumn). For this reason, the data collected for these four sessions were separated during the test period to prove the applicability of the techniques used here under different climatic conditions. Table 3 compares the MAPEs values obtained for all sessions. MAPEs values of the different techniques (AIs and PrevPT) are very similar for all cases. Fig. 17 presents the Boxplot of the forecasting techniques for the four situations. The results show that the behavior of the tech- niques is very similar for all sessions with different solar avail- ability. This characteristic can be observed comparing the DL interquartile range limits: 2.79%e0.98% for winter, \u00012.66%e0.78% for spring, \u00012.96%e0.84% for summer and \u00013.11%e0.63% for autumn. 3.4.

Efﬁcient Frontier results show that the optimal portfolio, i. e., the combination with best predictability results, is 10.62% MLP, 70.5% RBF, 3.13% SVR and 15.75% DL. PrevPT, in its characteristic of self-adaptive structure, found the best combination that can be seen in Fig. 23 (a) in its complete structure and (b) in its simpliﬁed form mathematically. The comparison between the distribution of prediction errors is shown in Fig. 24. For PrevPT, 73.62% of the forecasts underestimate solar energy availability and 26.37% overestimate solar resource.

Lima et al. / Energy 195 (2020) 117016 11 In the city of Fortaleza, the climate can be divided into rainy and rainless sessions. For this reason, the data collected for these two sessions were separated during the test period to prove the appli- cability of the techniques used under different climatic conditions. Table 5 compares the MAPEs values obtained for both sessions. MAPEs values of the different (AIs and PrevPT) are very similar for the rainy and rainless sessions. Fig. 25 presents the Boxplot of the forecasting techniques for both situations. The results show that the behavior of the tech- niques is very similar for both sessions with different solar avail- ability. This characteristic can be observed comparing the DL interquartile range limits: 3.69%e2.75% for rainy season and \u00013.62%e3.47% for rainless session. 3.6. Discussions As demonstrated by the MAPE, the techniques obtained satis- factory results regarding the solar resource forecast. Characteristics such as higher variance and standard deviation may justify worse prediction indexes obtained in Spain by almost all techniques. The worst performance was obtained by SVR, with MAPE of 8.34% in the case of Spain and MAPE of 8% in the case of Brazil, which can be deﬁned as good, considering that these techniques obtained an average hit rate of 91.66% and 92%, respectively. DL used for forecasting stands out in comparison to all the individual forecast techniques (MLP, RBF and SVR). Hence, the use of DL as solar resource predictor is highly beneﬁcial for the expansion of PV power; the implementation of this technique al- lows for signiﬁcant improvements over the other techniques used for comparison. Considering the use of PrevPT for the integration of forecasting techniques, the methodology managed to ﬁnd an ideal weighting for the impact of each of the individual prediction techniques, as well as in its adaptive structure, was able to disregard some tech- nique which may be causing negative impacts to a solar resource Fig. 23.

PrevPT, in its ﬁnal integration and almost all partial integrations, obtained the best indices in the evaluation criteria than the other predictive methods, with ﬁnal MAPE of 5.36% in the case of Spain and with MAPE of 4.52% in the case of Brazil. The techniques obtained an average hit rate of 91.66%e95,48%, highlighting the very high quality of the techniques and methods employed. 4. Conclusions DL used for solar prediction obtained better results than the MLP, RBF and SVR techniques. Regarding PrevPT, errors resulting from the integration of forecast techniques had a better perfor- mance than the individual errors of each asset. To compare: \u0004 MAPE for MLP, RBF, SVR and DL in Spain was 8.06%, 7.16%, 8.34% and 6.89%, respectively; as for PrevPT, it was 5.36%. In Brazil, MAPE for MLP, RBF, SVR and DL was 8.53%, 6.32%, 8% and 6.08%, respectively; for PrevPT was 4.52%; \u0004 The range \u000110%e10% for MLP, RBF, SVR and DL in Spain was 71.29%, 73.27%, 73.71% and 75.87%, respectively; for PrevPT, it was 83.42%. In Brazil, the range \u000110%e10% for MLP, RBF, SVR and DL was 70.48%, 75.73%, 72.32% and 78.68%, respectively; for PrevPT was 90.23%; Hence, the use of DL as a solar resource predictor has a signiﬁ- cant gain in relation to other individual forecasting methods. The use of PrevPT is proposed as a methodology to ﬁnd ideal impacts of AIs. The proposed PrevPT is able to establish the inte- gration of four distinct AI forecasting methods, thus determining an optimal participation of each prediction technique, aiming to reduce predictability errors. It can be concluded that PrevPT is a tool with signiﬁcant positive impacts for better solar energy man- agement, which can be subjected to different climatic conditions, with different solar resource availability and different locations, as presented and tested herein.
