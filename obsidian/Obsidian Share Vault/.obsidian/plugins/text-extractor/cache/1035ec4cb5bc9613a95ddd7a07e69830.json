By estimating RUL, engineers can schedule maintenance, optimize operating e\u0000ciency, and avoid unplanned downtime. For this reason, estimating RUL is a top priority in predictive maintenance programs. An RUL estimation model provides a con\u0000dence-bound RUL prediction. The model inputs are condition indicators (features) extracted from sensor data whose behavior changes in a predictable way as the system degrades. The method used to calculate RUL depends on the kind of data available: Lifetime data indicating how long it took for similar machines to reach failure Run-to-failure histories of similar machines A known threshold value of a condition indicator that detects failure Predictive Maintenance Toolbox™ provides models for estimating RUL from each type of data. Lifetime Data Proportional hazard models and probability distributions of component failure times are used to estimate RUL from lifetime data. A simple example is estimating the discharge time of a battery based on past discharge times and covariates, such as environmental temperature and load. The survival function plot in Figure 1 shows the pr obability that a battery will fail based on how long it has been in operation. The plot shows, for example, that if the battery is in operation for 75 cy cles, it has a 90% chance of being at the end of its lif etime. Run-to-Failure Data If you have a database of run-to-failure data from similar components or different components showing similar behavior, you can estimate RUL using similarity methods. These methods capture degradation pro\u0000les and compare them with new data coming in from the machine to determine which pro\u0000le the data matches most closely. In Figure 2, the degr adation pro\u0000les of historical run-to-failure data sets from an engine are shown in blue and the current data from the engine is shown in red. Based on a distribution of the nearest historical pro\u0000les, the RUL is estimated to be around 65 cy cles.  9:34 Learn about the most common RUL estimator models: similarity, survival, and degradation.

This can mean run-to- failure data or lifetime data is not available. However, you likely have information on prescribed threshold values—for example, the temperature of a liquid in a pump cannot exceed 160 ˚F (71 ˚C ) and the pressure must be under 2,200 psi (155 bar). With this thr eshold information, you can \u0000t degradation models to condition indicators extracted from sensor data, which change linearly or exponentially over time. These degradation models estimate RUL by predicting when the condition indicator will cross the threshold. They can also be used with a fused condition indicator that incorporates information from more than one sensor using techniques such as principal component analysis. Figure 3 shows an exponential degr adation model that tracks failure in a high-speed bearing used in a wind turbine. The condition indicator is shown in blue. The degradation model predicts that the bearing will cross the threshold value in approximately 9.5 da ys. The region shaded in red represents the con\u0000dence bounds for this prediction. Once you have designed an RUL model based on the data you have available, you can integrate it into dashboards used by operators or alarm systems monitored by maintenance teams. Teams can then respond to changes in equipment health quickly and e\u0000ciently, and without affecting operations.  Figure 2. Degr adation pro\u0000les (blue) based on run- to-failure data. The distribution of the stars (endpoints) of the nearest blue curves gives an RUL of 65 cy cles. ( )See example Figure 3. Degr adation model for a high-speed bearing. The bearing has an estimated RUL of 9.5 days based on its current condition data (blue) and the exponential degradation model (red) \u0000t to this data.
