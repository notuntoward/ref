Copula correlation modeling of aggregate solar irradiance in spatial networks Joakim Munkhammar Built Environment Energy Systems Group Department of Solid State Physics Uppsala University Uppsala 751 21 Email: joakim.munkhammar@angstrom.uu.se Joakim Wid´en Built Environment Energy Systems Group Department of Solid State Physics Uppsala University Uppsala 751 21 Email: joakim.widen@angstrom.uu.se Abstract—Estimating solar irradiance over several locations in a spatial network is of interest for a wide variety of applications, in particular for simulations of distribution grid with high photovoltaic (PV) penetration. This paper presents a method for estimating the clear-sky index for N locations in any spatial network of locations. The model is based on the clear-sky index distribution for one location, and the cross-correlation of clear-sky index between all location pairs. The correlated clear- sky index for each location is obtained from a copula model of correlation based on the station pair correlations and the clear-sky index for a single location. In this paper the clear-sky index for a single location is obtained by a bimodal mixture distribution model and the correlation between station pairs is modeled via an exponential model. The model bridges the gap between estimating the clear-sky index for adjacent and maximally dispersed locations. Applications of this model to simulations of aggregate photovoltaic power generation is also discussed. I. INTRODUCTION Estimating the variability of solar irradiance on Earth’s surface is useful for several solar engineering applications such as grid integration of PV power production [1], [2], [3]. By quantifying the solar irradiance variability, it is possible to improve the design and operation of power systems where large amounts of distributed PV power might be injected into the grid [1], [3]. This is useful in order to avoid costly grid reinforcements [1], [4], especially for large-scale deployment of distributed PV power production [5]. Characterization of solar irradiance in spatial networks of locations depends on the variability of solar irradiance at each single location. The variability of solar irradiance for single locations has been studied thoroughly, starting with initial studies by ˚Angstr¨om relating the duration of bright sunshine to the average solar irradiance by a linear ﬁt [6], [7], [8]. Improved measurement resolution enabled more advanced statistical analysis, yielding various probability distribution models of the clear-sky index [9], [10], [11], [12]. These include models based on mixture distributions [13], [14], [15] and of convolution type [16]. For exam- ple, bimodal mixture distribution models, models of solar irradiance at single locations, which are common in the single location solar irradiance modeling literature, have been shown to be more accurate in representing the clear-sky index than convolution type models [16]. The variability of solar irradiance for multiple locations has been studied considerably, for dispersed locations [5], [15], [17], correlations between solar irradiance in so-called virtual networks [5], [18] and ramp-correlations [18], [19], [20]. This paper utilizes the network concept combined with station-pair cross-correlations, ﬁrst investigated for solar irradiance in [5], [21]. Further, these concepts have been used in studies regarding models of instantaneous and ramp correlations, such as [18] and [19]. They have also been used to develop a wavelet-based model for aggregate solar irradiance variability for large PV plants [22]. In terms of statistical modeling, correlations can also be modeled using copulas, which for example have been used in modeling of aggregated wind power production [23]. Copula correlation modeling has also been used to relate solar irradiance and number of sunshine hours [24]. A model that generates correlated data sets of clear-sky index for any set of locations based on a clear-sky index distribution and cross-correlations between all locations is yet to be done. Such a model is developed in this paper. II. METHODOLOGY This section is structured such that the complete model setup is presented in Section II-A, the bimodal clear-sky index model is presented in Section II-B, and the data used for this calibration in II-C. In Section II-D the exponential correlation model is presented and in Section II-E the copula correlation model is presented, and ﬁnally in Section III applications to PV power generation is discussed. A. Model This paper aims to establish a theoretical model of cor- related clear-sky index for an arbitrary set of locations in a spatial network. This is made in a number of steps according to: 1. Modeling the clear-sky index for a single location using a bimodal mixture distribution model, ﬁtted to data on clear-sky index for a single location. 2. Choose a spatial network of locations, and from this use the exponential correlation model to estimate pair correlations. 3. Generating the clear-sky index data for all locations in the spatial network by setting up a copula model, based on the synthetic clear-sky index in step 1, and the estimated correlations in step 2. For this paper a set of scenarios are simulated, where the aggregate clear-sky index is computed for a set of locations in a spatial network. The four scenarios are based on a grid of 5 × 5 locations with a separation of: (A) 125 m (B) 250 m (C) 500 m (D) 1000 m Formally, the clear-sky index κ is deﬁned as the ratio between the measured global horizontal irradiance (GHI) G(t) and the estimated global horizontal clear-sky irradiance Gc(t) over time t: κ(t) ≡ G(t) Gc(t) . (1) For N locations, and Gi(t), Gc,i(t) deﬁned for locations i ∈ [1, ..., N ], this can be used to deﬁne the so-called aggregate clear-sky index: ¯κ(t) ≡ 1 N N∑ i=1 Gi(t) Gc,i(t) . (2) For all simulations in this study the clear-sky irradiance Gc,i is considered approximately the same for all locations, and thus only a common Gc is used. Both the clear-sky index κ and the aggregate clear-sky index ¯κ are considered stochastic variables in this paper, independent of time. This enables modeling of the clear-sky index by means of probability distributions. This was done previously for single locations [15], [16] and for multiple dispersed locations [5], [15]. B. Bimodal clear-sky index The bimodal clear-sky index model used in this paper was developed previously in [15], but it will — for the sake of clarity — be introduced brieﬂy in this paper as well. Two important aspects arise in statistical modeling with mixture distributions: on the one hand, the number of mixtures, on the other, the family of probability distribu- tions (the same family of distribution is here assumed for all components of the mixture). The clear-sky index is by inspection commonly identiﬁed as having two peaks, which was assumed in [15]. As regards bimodal mixture distribution models, it should be noted that it can be shown that for the mixture of two normally distributed populations, the mixture density is bimodal if and only if |µ1−µ2|/σ > 2, with common variance σ2 and means µ1, µ2 [25]. A standard tool for estimation of mixture models is the EM (Expectation–Maximization) algorithm. A version implemented in the software R and found in the package mixtools was used [26], [27]. Parameters of the distributions and mixing weights were estimated. For a bimodal normal distribution, or generally a mixture of two distributions, can be written as: f (x) = π1ϕ(x; µ1, σ1) + π2ϕ(x; µ2, σ2) (3) where π1 and π2 = (1 − π1) are the weights of respective population and ϕ(x; µ, σ) is the PDF (here a normal distri- bution) with mean µ and standard deviation σ. Based on the data set, presented in Section II-C, the EM algorithm results in the setup is presented in Table I. It should be noted that estimating clear-sky index from data requires the process of estimating global horizontal TABLE I ESTIMATED PARAMETER VALUES FOR THE BIMODAL NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF CLEAR-SKY INDEX USING EQ. 3 µ1 µ2 σ1 σ2 π1 π2 0.58 1.07 0.35 0.04 0.63 0.37 clear-sky irradiance for each time-step. This includes for example the sun’s position on the sky dome, but also assumptions regarding atmospheric turbidity. Since this can underestimate and overestimate the clear-sky index in the order of a few percent, this setup serves as an approximation. The mean of the clear sky index, and the position of the peaks of the distribution, are then likely scaled by a few percent. C. The data set The data for solar irradiation that was used to estimate the distribution family parameters for the bimodal mix- ture distribution model was one-minute resolution over one year (2008) obtained from SMHI for Norrk¨oping, Sweden (59◦35 ′31” N 17 ◦11′8” E) [28]. Global clear sky irradiance was calculated with the Ineichen-Perez model [29]. In order to avoid inﬁnities associated with low solar angles the clear- sky index was only obtained for solar angles above 20 degrees. The total number of one-minute resolution data points used was then 111221. In practice any data set of solar irradiance and clear-sky irradiance model could be used in the modeling. D. Correlation modeling When modeling correlations for arbitrary network conﬁg- urations, an exponential model for the station-pair correlation can be used [18]: ρ(∆x) = e −k∆x, (4) where k is a parameter determining how fast the correlation decreases with distance, and ∆x is the distance between the two stations. For the particular case in this study k = 0.0013 m−1 was used, which gave a good ﬁt to correlation data from a previous study [19]. E. Copula correlation model This section describes the copula modeling for correlated clear-sky index for a set of locations in a spatial network. It is based on having a network of locations, a clear-sky index distribution for one location and correlations in clear- sky index between location pairs. The correlations are set up in a so-called correlation matrix. A copula is an increasingly common method for modeling correlation between stochastic variables [30]. It is based on the notion that any N stochastic variables, which have a dependence that is reﬂected in the correlation between vari- ables, can be modeled via a so-called copula; that is, a joint distribution function for all stochastic variables considered. An N -variable copula is used in this paper, and it models the dependence between N stochastic variables by generat- ing N sets of correlated values for each stochastic variable based on a probability distribution for each location. For this paper the distributions are all of the same type: each is the clear-sky index distribution for one location. This, for example, renders an aggregate clear-sky index in eqn. 2 which depends on the correlation. Formally, one way of obtaining a copula is to use the inversion method, which is deﬁned as follows [30, p.51]. Assume that N stochastic variables X1, X2, ..., XN with cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) FX1, FX2 , ..., FXN are given. Then in accordance with Sklar’s theorem, which certiﬁes the existence of a copula [30], these distributions can be joined via a copula C if the copula can be expressed as: FX1,X2,...,XN (X1, X2, ..., XN ) = (5) = C(FX1 (x1), FX2(x2), ..., FXN (xN )). (6) The copula function can be written: C(u1, u2, ..., uN ) = (7) = FX1,X2,...,XN (F −1 X1 (u1), F −1 X2 (u2), ..., F −1 XN (uN )). (8) for FXi = ui, i = 1, 2, ..., N , where u1, u2, ..., uN are re- alizations of uniform variables U1, U2, ..., UN , respectively. A special case is a copula with two stochastic variables: a bivariate copula. Such a copula would, in this study, correspond to modeling the dependency between a single pair of locations, and be represented by a copula function C(x1, x2) = FX1,X2(F −1 X1 (u1), F −1 X2 (u2)). (9) A copula of N stochastic variables, that in this study models N locations, utilizes the cross-correlation for each station pair, set up in a N × N matrix Γ, in the copula function to approximate the dependence between the stochastic variables for clear-sky normalized solar irradiance. The matrix Γ represents the cross-correlation (referred to as correlation in this paper) between each pair of locations with the zero lag autocorrelation values, which always equal 1, on the diagonal. It should be noted that the copula can be based on stochastic variables of any type of distribution. The copula itself is based on a separate distribution, the type of which has to be set a priori, but since this is the ﬁrst study of its kind, the standard normal distribution was chosen. Other types of copula distributions may potentially give slightly more reﬁned results, and a detailed investigation of this is left for future studies. In this study, the correlation for a set of locations in each network scenario was computed and set up in a correlation matrix Γ. A large number of sample points from the clear- sky index was obtained, 40000 in this case. That number was chosen since it was sufﬁcient for generating a smooth single-location clear-sky index. With the sampled clear-sky index data set and the correlation matrix Γ it was possible to generate copula correlated data sets for the clear-sky index at each location using the Matlab routine copularnd. Finally, the aggregate clear-sky index was computed as the sum of the correlated clear-sky index data sets. III. MODELING PV POWER GENERATION FROM THE CLEAR-SKY INDEX This paper mainly regards correlation modeling of solar irradiance, but the applicability of the modeling of grid- connected PV is interesting in solar engineering, which is introduced and discussed here. In order to model PV power generation from synthetic clear-sky index, it is necessary that the GHI is estimated based on the clear-sky index and the sun’s path across the sky dome over day and season. Once this is done, in order to use the GHI given by the probability distributions, to estimate the power generation from an arbitrarily oriented PV system, a number of transformations are required: 1) Split GHI into DHI and BHI. 2) Convert DHI and BHI to the tilted plane of the PV array. 3) Apply models for the PV system components, e.g. PV modules and inverter. There are many options available for all three steps. The following is one such option. To be able to simulate a PV system with an arbitrary slope and azimuth angle, GHI has to be split into beam horizontal irradiance (BHI) and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI), because these components have different incidence angles on the tilted plane and hence need to be re-scaled separately. Many models have been proposed to determine the diffuse fraction of GHI. Dervishi and Mahdavi [31] provide an overview and an evaluation of different models that relate the diffuse fraction kd to the clearness index kt = G/G0, i.e. the ratio of GHI to the extraterrestrial radiation on a horizontal surface. It is also possible to relate kd directly to κ as proposed by Suehrcke and McCormick [32]. However, in the following, we use the model by Erbs et al. [33], relating kd to kt, because it is uncomplicated and still shown to be among the best-performing models [31]. In the Erbs model, the diffuse fraction kd is kd = 1 − 0.09ktforkt ≤ 0.22 (10) kd = 0.9511 − 0.1604kt + 4.388k2 t − 16.638k3 t + (11) +12.336k4 t for0.22 < kt ≤ 0.80 (12) kd = 0.165forkt > 0.80 (13) The diffuse and beam radiation components are then ob- tained as: Gd = kdG (14) Gb = (1 − kd)G (15) Next, radiation on the tilted plane is obtained by scaling beam radiation by the geometric factor Rb = cos θ/ cos θz, where θ and θz are the incidence angles for beam radiation on the tilted plane and the horizontal plane, respectively [34]. Diffuse and ground-reﬂected radiation on the tilted plane have to be calculated with other, semi-empirical models. With the Hay and Davies model for diffuse radiation [34], global radiation on the tilted plane is given as: GT = GbRb + Gd [ (1 − Ai) ( 1 + cos β 2 ) + AiRb ] + (16) +Gρg ( 1 − cos β 2 ) (17) where the anisotropy index Ai is the ratio between the incident beam radiation Gb and the extraterrestrial radiation G0 on the horizontal plane, β is the tilt angle of the plane and ρg is the ground reﬂectance. A simple model for the DC output from the PV array is: Pdc = AGT ηm(1 − qa) (18) where A is the area of the array, ηm is the PV module efﬁciency and qa accounts for different losses in the PV system not modeled explicitly. The inverter in the PV system limits the output AC power to its rated power, and is therefore important to include in the model since there is a ﬁnite probability, albeit small, that very high κ samples are obtained, leading to high DC powers being cut by the inverter. The output AC power can be modeled as [35]: Pac = Pac0 Pdc − Ps0 Pdc0 − Ps0 (19) for Pdc values between Ps0 and Pdc0 where Pac0 is the rated inverter AC power, Pdc0 is the DC power at which the AC rating is achieved and Ps0 is the inverter threshold power, i.e. the lowest DC input that gives an AC output. Below Ps0 the output is zero and above Pdc0 it is limited to Pac0. This model can be used on the aggregate clear-sky index, instead of the single location clear-sky index, but it is not completely accurate. The reason for this is that the aggre- gate clear-sky index for several locations hides information regarding beam and diffuse irradiance components for each location, which makes the splitting of beam and diffuse irradiance in the Erbs model inaccurate. Instead, the PV power generation model should be used on the correlated time-series of clear-sky index for each location, and then the aggregate PV power generation should be estimated by summing up the complete power generation over all locations. This was also discussed in [15], for maximally dispersed locations in a spatial network. IV. RESULTS In this section the results from the simulations are pre- sented, in Section IV-A the bimodal mixture distribution for the clear-sky index is presented, in IV-B the results for correlation modeling is presented and in IV-C the results for the aggregate clear-sky index for the network scenarios are presented. A. Bimodal distribution Sampling from the bimodal probability distribution model gives a synthetic clear-sky index, which is shown as a histogram of 40000 sampled points in Figure 1. This model was shown to accurately describe the clear- sky index for the data set, see [15]. For more information on the bimodal mixture distribution model see [15]. It should be noted that any set of clear-sky index data may be used for this purpose, even an empirical data set, this data set is merely used as an example for illustrating the model. B. Correlation modeling The exponential model for correlating the clear-sky index was used for a set of locations in each network scenario. In Figure 2 the correlation given by the model is shown over the distances considered in the simulations.

Copula correlation model for aggregate clear-sky index For the network scenarios, with the use of the synthetic bimodal mixture distribution clear-sky index, the exponential correlation model and the copula correlation model the aggregate clear-sky index for each scenario is presented in Figure 3. The aggregate clear-sky index for adjacent locations is equivalent to the clear-sky index for a single location, as presented in Figure 1. As the dispersion between the locations increases, from scenario (A) to (D) in Figure 3, the aggregate clear-sky index is altered and a progress from bimodal to unimodal, can be identiﬁed. The case of completely uncorrelated, that is maximally dispersed, locations was studied in [15] and it was shown that the aggregate clear-sky index approached a normal distribution, as an effect of the central limit theorem. Correspondingly, scenario (D) appears to be similar to a normal distribution. V.

Spatial network conﬁgurations and aggregate clear-sky index for the set of network scenarios, from top to bottom: (A), (B), (C) and (D), which may be found in Section II-A. presented. This model was shown to conform to previous estimates for maximally dispersed locations, and to bridge the gap between previous models of aggregate clear-sky in- dex for adjacent and dispersed locations in a spatial network. The model is a ﬁrst of its kind in modeling the aggregate clear-sky index for any set of locations in a spatial network. More detailed studies, in particular based on estimated radiometer data for the clear-sky index is needed to verify the accuracy of the model. It could also be interesting to construct a similar model for the correlations of ramp-rates as well. Applications of this type of model include probabilistic modeling for PV power generation distributed over typically city-size regions. This can be done with the model for the clear-sky index, and the model for PV power generation pre- sented in this paper. It would also be interesting to combine this type of modeling with other probabilistic models for electricity use, such as household electricity use and electric vehicle charging, such as [36].
