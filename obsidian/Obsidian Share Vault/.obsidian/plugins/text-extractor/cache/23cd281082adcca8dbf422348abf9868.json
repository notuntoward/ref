Such temporal correla- tions can be understood not only by heterogeneous interevent times (IETs) but also by correlations between IETs. In contrast to the role of heterogeneous IETs on the autocorrelation function, yet little is known about the eﬀects due to the correlations between IETs. In order to rigorously study these eﬀects, we derive an analytical form of the autocorrelation function for the arbitrary IET distribution in the case with weakly correlated IETs, where the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula is adopted for modeling the joint probability distribution function of two consecutive IETs. Our analytical results are conﬁrmed by numerical simulations for exponential and power-law IET dis- tributions. For the power-law case, we ﬁnd a tendency of the steeper decay of the autocorrelation function for the stronger correlation between IETs. Our analytical approach enables us to better understand long-term temporal correlations induced by the correlations between IETs. I. INTRODUCTION A variety of dynamical processes in natural and so- cial phenomena have been described by a series of events or event sequences showing non-Poissonian or bursty na- ture. Examples include solar ﬂares [1], earthquakes [2, 3], neuronal ﬁrings [4], and human activities [5, 6]. Tempo- ral correlations in such bursty event sequences have of- ten been characterized in terms of autocorrelation func- tions [7–10]. The autocorrelation function for an event sequence x(t) is deﬁned with delay time td as follows: A(td) ≡ ⟨x(t)x(t + td)⟩t − ⟨x(t)⟩2 t ⟨x(t)2⟩t − ⟨x(t)⟩2 t , (1) where ⟨·⟩t denotes a time average. The event sequence x(t) can be considered to have the value of 1 at the moment of event occurred, 0 otherwise. For the event sequences with long-term memory eﬀects, one typically ﬁnds an algebraically decaying behavior with a decaying exponent γ: A(td) ∼ t−γ d . (2) The decaying exponent γ is known to be related to other exponents characterizing temporal correlations, such as Hurst exponent H [11] and the scaling exponent of the power spectral density η [12–14], via the relations H = 1−γ/2 and η = 1−γ [7, 8, 15, 16]. Temporal correlations measured by A(td) can be fully understood not only by heterogeneous properties of time intervals between two consecutive events, i.e., interevent times (IETs), but also by correlations between IETs [17]. The heterogeneities of IETs, denoted by τ , indicate the presence of multiple timescales or even the absence ∗ hang-hyun.jo@apctp.org of characteristic timescales (i.e., scale-free), which is of- ten related to nonhomogeneous or time-dependent Pois- son processes [18]. Many empirical analyses [6] have shown that heterogeneities of IETs can be characterized by heavy-tailed or power-law IET distributions P (τ ) with a power-law exponent α: P (τ ) ∼ τ −α, (3) which readily implies clustered short IETs even without correlations between IETs. This phenomenon has been called bursts, namely, rapidly occurring events within short time periods alternating with long inactive peri- ods [5, 6]. It has been known that bursty interactions between individuals have a strong inﬂuence on the dy- namical processes taking place in a network of individu- als [19–26]. When IETs are fully uncorrelated with each other as in renewal processes [27], the scaling relations between α and γ have been analytically derived as [28] α + γ = 2 for 1 < α ≤ 2, α − γ = 2 for 2 < α ≤ 3. (4) This implies that the decaying behavior of the autocorre- lation function can be accounted for solely by the power- law tail of the IET distribution. In contrast to the role of heterogeneous IETs on the long-term temporal correlations, the eﬀects due to the correlations between IETs are far from being fully ex- plored, except for a few recent works: These eﬀects were studied, e.g., by comparing the original, empirical auto- correlation functions to those calculated for the random- ized event sequences [9, 16]. In other works, modeling and numerical approaches were taken for investigating how strong correlations between IETs should be present to violate the scaling relations in Eq. (4) [17, 29, 30]. This situation clearly calls for a rigorous, analytical approach to the role of correlations between IETs in temporal cor- relations. For this, the correlations between IETs can bearXiv:1901.00982v4 [physics.soc-ph] 18 Jul 2019 2 quantiﬁed by a memory coeﬃcient M [31] among oth- ers such as local variation [32] or bursty trains [9]. The memory coeﬃcient is deﬁned as the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient between two consecutive IETs, whose value for a sequence of n IETs, i.e., {τ1, · · · , τn}, can be estimated by M ≡ 1 n − 1 n−1∑ i=1 (τi − µ1)(τi+1 − µ2) σ1σ2 , (5) where µ1 (µ2) and σ1 (σ2) are the average and the stan- dard deviation of the ﬁrst (last) n − 1 IETs, respectively. Positive M implies that the large (small) IETs tend to be followed by large (small) IETs. Negative M indicates the opposite tendency, while M = 0 means the uncorrelated IETs. We mainly focus on the case with M ≥ 0, based on the empirical observations [31, 33–35]. In order to rigorously study the eﬀects of correlations between IETs on the autocorrelation function, we de- rive an analytical form of the autocorrelation function for the arbitrary P (τ ) and for small M , i.e., in the case with weakly correlated IETs, where the Farlie-Gumbel- Morgenstern copula [36, 37] is adopted for modeling the joint probability distribution function of two consecutive IETs. Our analytical results are numerically conﬁrmed for both exponential and power-law IET distributions. In particular, for the power-law case, we ﬁnd the steeper decay of the autocorrelation function for the stronger cor- relation between IETs: The apparent decaying exponent γ is found to increase with M . Our ﬁnding can help us to understand the eﬀects of correlations between IETs on other measures such as Hurst exponent H and the scaling exponent of the power spectral density η because γ, H, and η are not independent of each other as mentioned. II. RESULTS A. Analysis We analyze the autocorrelation function A(td) in Eq. (1). Since A(td = 0) = 1 is obvious, we consider the case with td > 0 unless otherwise stated. Note that for a Poisson process, i.e., without any memory eﬀects in it, A(td) = 0 for all td > 0. The event sequence x(t) has the value of 1 at the moment of event occurred, 0 otherwise. Each event is assumed to have a duration of 1. Since events may overlap with each other due to their duration, we set the lower bound of IETs as 1, i.e., τmin = 1, for the sake of simplicity. Then for an event sequence with n events during the time period T , we get λ ≡ ⟨x(t)⟩t = n/T = 1/µ, with µ denoting the mean IET. Using this λ, one can write ⟨x(t)x(t + td)⟩t = λ ∞∑ k=1 Pk(td), (6) where Pk(td) is the probability that two events occurred in times t and t + td are separated by exactly k interevent times (IETs) for k = 1, 2, · · · . Using the joint probabil- ity distribution function (PDF) of k consecutive IETs, denoted by P (τ1, · · · , τk), one gets Pk(td) = k∏ i=1 ∫ ∞ 0 dτiP (τ1, · · · , τk) δ ( td − k∑ i=1 τi ) , (7) where δ(·) is a Dirac delta function. Then the autocor- relation function in Eq. (1) can be rewritten as A(td) = ∑∞ k=1 Pk(td) − λ 1 − λ , (8) where we have used ⟨x(t)2⟩t = ⟨x(t)⟩t = λ as x(t) = 0, 1. Since we only consider the correlations between two consecutive IETs, P (τ1, · · · , τk) in Eq. (7) can be factor- ized in terms of joint PDFs of two consecutive IETs, i.e., P (τi, τi+1) for i = 1, · · · , n − 1. Precisely, by assuming that an IET, τi+1, is conditioned only by its previous IET, τi, namely, P (τi+1|τi, τi−1, · · · ) = P (τi+1|τi), (9) one obtains P (τ1, · · · , τk) = k−1∏ i=1 P (τi, τi+1) ∕ k−1∏ i=2 P (τi). (10) For modeling P (τi, τi+1), we adopt a Farlie-Gumbel- Morgenstern (FGM) copula among others [36, 37] be- cause the FGM copula is simple and analytically tractable, despite the range of correlation being some- what limited, which will be discussed later. The FGM copula is originally deﬁned as a function C joining a bi- variate cumulative distribution function (CDF) to their one-dimensional marginal CDFs such that G(x1, x2) = C[u1(x1), u2(x2)] = u1u2[1 + r(1 − u1)(1 − u2)], (11) where u1 (u2) is a CDF of variable x1 (x2), and r controls the correlation between x1 and x2 [36, 37]. The bivariate PDF of x1 and x2 is obtained by ∂2G(x1, x2) ∂x1∂x2 = P1(x1)P2(x2)[1 + r(2u1 − 1)(2u2 − 1)], (12) where P1(x1) and P2(x2) denote PDFs of x1 and x2, respectively. This FGM copula has been applied, e.g., for modeling the bivariate luminosity function of galax- ies [37] and for the health care data analysis [38]. The joint PDF of two consecutive IETs based on the FGM copula is written as P (τi, τi+1) = P (τi)P (τi+1) [1 + rf (τi)f (τi+1)] , (13) where f (τ ) ≡ 2F (τ ) − 1, F (τ ) ≡ ∫ τ 0 dτ ′P (τ ′). (14) 3 Here P (τi) and P (τi+1) are assumed to have the same functional form. The range of the parameter r is given as |r| ≤ 1 because |f (τ )| ≤ 1 from 0 ≤ F (τ ) ≤ 1 and P (τi, τi+1) ≥ 0. To relate r to M in Eq. (5), we redeﬁne M as M ≡ ⟨τiτi+1⟩ − µ 2 σ2 , (15) where ⟨τiτi+1⟩ ≡ ∫ ∞ 0 dτi ∫ ∞ 0 dτi+1τiτi+1P (τi, τi+1), (16) and µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of IETs, respectively. Using Eq. (13) we get M = r σ2 [∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ P (τ )f (τ ) ]2 ≡ ar. (17) The ratio a between M and r is determined only by P (τ ), irrespective of the correlations between IETs. Note that the upper bound of a is 1/3 for any P (τ ), hence |M | ≤ 1/3 [39]. Due to this bound, applications of the FGM copula are limited to weakly correlated cases. By plugging Eq. (13) into Eq. (10), we get P (τ1, · · · , τk) = k∏ i=1 P (τi) k−1∏ i=1 [1 + rf (τi)f (τi+1)] . (18) As it is not straightforward to analyze Eq. (18), we focus on the weakly correlated case with |r| ≪ 1. In this range of r, one can expand Eq. (18) up to the ﬁrst order of r as follows: P (τ1, · · · , τk) ≈ k∏ i=1 P (τi) [ 1 + r k−1∑ i=1 f (τi)f (τi+1) + O(r2) ] , (19) which enables us to calculate the Laplace transform of Pk(td) in Eq. (7): ̃Pk(s) ≡ ∫ ∞ 0 dtdPk(td)e−std ≈ ˜P (s)k + r(k − 1) ˜P (s)k−2 ˜Q(s) 2 + O(r2),(20) with ˜P (s) ≡ ∫ ∞ 0 dτ P (τ )e−sτ , (21) ˜Q(s) ≡ ∫ ∞ 0 dτ P (τ )f (τ )e−sτ . (22) Then we obtain up to the ﬁrst order of r ∞∑ k=1 ̃Pk(s) ≈ ˜P (s) 1 − ˜P (s) + r ˜Q(s) 2 [1 − ˜P (s)]2 + O(r2). (23) The calculation of the higher-order terms of r is straight- forward. By taking the inverse Laplace transform of Eq. (23) and plugging it into Eq. (8), we ﬁnally get the autocorrelation function as a function of M for the arbi- trary form of P (τ ), which is denoted by AM (td) hereafter. -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0 1 2 3 4 5AM(td)(µ-1)/(4M) td/µ simul. µ=100, M=0.005 µ=100, M=0.05 µ=1000, M=0.05 analysis FIG. 1. Case with the exponential IET distribution in Eq. (24): Simulation results of the autocorrelation function AM (td) for various values of µ and M (symbols) are collapsed when rescaled properly. They are in good agreement to the analytical result up to the ﬁrst order of M in Eq. (26) (black dotted curve). Each point and its standard error were ob- tained over 10 4 event sequences of n = 5 × 10 4. B. Exponential IET distribution One can consider the case with exponentially dis- tributed IETs that are correlated with each other. De- spite the fact that it is hard to ﬁnd real-world examples of this case, we study this case because it is a good testbed for our analytical framework. Precisely, we use the fol- lowing form of P (τ ) with the mean IET µ ≫ τmin = 1: P (τ ) = µ −1e −τ /µ, (24) by which one gets a = 1/4 in Eq. (17), hence r = 4M . From Eq. (24), one gets ˜P (s) = 1 µs + 1 , ˜Q(s) = −µs (µs + 1)(µs + 2) . (25) Plugging Eq. (25) into Eq. (23) as well as using Eq. (8), we analytically derive the autocorrelation function up to the ﬁrst order of M as AM (td) ≈ 4M tde−2td/µ µ(µ − 1) + O(M 2), (26) where λ = 1/µ has been used. Note that the ﬁrst term on the right hand side in Eq. (26) can be written as [4M/(µ− 1)]g(td/µ) with g(x) = xe−2x, implying that AM (td) for various values of µ and M can be collapsed when rescaled properly. For the numerical validation of our analytical result, we introduce an algorithm for generating the event se- quence using the FGM copula provided that P (τ ) and M are given, which is called the copula-based algo- rithm [40]: To generate a sequence of n IETs, i.e., {τ1, · · · , τn}, the ﬁrst IET τ1 is drawn from P (τ ) and the second IET τ2 is drawn from the conditional PDF P (τ2|τ1) = P (τ1, τ2)/P (τ1), where P (τ1, τ2) is modeled by the FGM copula in Eq. (13). Then τi for i = 3, · · · , n 4 are sequentially drawn. Once the sequence of n IETs is ready, the timings of n + 1 events are set to be t0 = 0 and ti = ∑i i′=1 τi′ for i = 1, · · · , n; the event sequence x(t) has the value of 1 for t ∈ {t0, · · · , tn}, otherwise x(t) = 0. This x(t) is then used to calculate the autocor- relation function in Eq. (1). As shown in Fig. 1, the simulation results using Eq. (24) for various values of µ and M are in good agree- ment to our analytical result in Eq. (26). C. Power-law IET distribution To be more realistic, we consider a power-law IET dis- tribution with an exponential cutoﬀ: P (τ ) = τ α−1 c Γ (1 − α, 1/τc) τ −αe−τ /τcθ(τ − 1), (27) where α and τc denote the power-law exponent and expo- nential cutoﬀ, respectively. Γ(·, ·) is an upper incomplete Gamma function and θ(·) is a Heaviside step function, implying τmin = 1. We also set τc = 106 for the rest of the paper, which is suﬃciently large for studying the scal- ing behavior of the autocorrelation function. With this setup we numerically obtain the value of a in Eq. (17), e.g., a ≈ 0.0039 for α = 1.4 and a ≈ 0.0033 for α = 2.7, respectively. Since the analysis of the autocorrelation function with Eq. (27) is not straightforward, we instead use a simple power-law function for the IET distribution as P (τ ) = (α − 1)τ −αθ(τ − 1), (28) which yet allows us to study the scaling behavior of the autocorrelation function to some extent. From Eq. (28) one gets ˜P (s) = (α − 1)s α−1Γ(1 − α, s), (29) ˜Q(s) = ˜P (s) − 2(α − 1)s 2α−2Γ(2 − 2α, s). (30) We ﬁrst analyze the case with 1 < α < 2. In the asymp- totic limit of s → 0 one obtains ˜P (s) ≈ 1 + b1s α−1 + c1s + O(s 2), (31) ˜Q(s) ≈ b1s α−1 − b2s 2α−2 + (c1 − c2)s + O(s 2), (32) where for α ̸= 3/2 b1 ≡ Γ(1 − α)(α − 1), c1 ≡ α − 1 2 − α , b2 ≡ Γ(2 − 2α)(2α − 2), c2 ≡ 2α − 2 3 − 2α . From Eqs. (8) and (23), and with λ = 0 due to the di- verging µ, we get for α ̸= 3/2 AM (td) ≈ B1t−(2−α) d + B2t−(4−2α) d + · · · + M a (C1t−α d + C2t−(3−α) d + · · · ) + O(M 2), (33) 10-4 10-2 100 100 102 104 (a) α=1.4 slope=-0.6A0(td) td simulation analysis inv.

(28) for the analysis]: Simulation re- sults of the autocorrelation function A0(td) (a,c) and the dif- ference between A0.002(td) and A0(td) (b,d) for α = 1.4 (a,b) and 2.7 (c,d) (blue circles) are compared to the corresponding analytical result in Eqs. (33) or (34) (red solid curve). We also plot the curves of A0(td) and A0.002(td) − A0(td) that are ob- tained by the numerical inverse Laplace transform of Eq. (23) with ˜P (s) in Eq. (29) and ˜Q(s) in Eq. (30) (black dotted curve). Each point and its standard error were obtained over up to 104 event sequences of n = 5 × 10 4. where B1 ≡ −1 b1Γ(α − 1) , B2 ≡ c1 b2 1Γ(2α − 3) , C1 ≡ −2b2 b1Γ(1 − α) , C2 ≡ −2c2 b1Γ(α − 2) . In the case with uncorrelated IETs, i.e., M = 0, the leading term of t −(2−α) d leads to the well-known scaling relation of α + γ = 2 for 1 < α < 2 in Eq. (4). The above analytical result in Eq. (33) is to be vali- dated by the simulation results using Eq. (27). For the uncorrelated IETs, A0(td) for α = 1.4 is calculated from the event sequences generated using the copula-based al- gorithm, as depicted in Fig. 2(a). The simulation re- sult of A0(td) turns out to be in good agreement with our analytical result in Eq. (33) with M = 0 for several decades of td. To conﬁrm the eﬀects due to the correla- tions between IETs, AM (td) is numerically obtained for α = 1.4 and M = 0.002 (i.e., r = M/a ≈ 0.52). Then we calculate its diﬀerence from the uncorrelated case, i.e., A0.002(td) − A0(td), which is found to be comparable to the analytical result up to the ﬁrst order of M in Eq. (33), see Fig. 2(b).

For the case with M = 0, the leading term of t −(α−2) d leads to the well-known scaling relation of α − γ = 2 for 2 < α < 3 in Eq. (4). We ﬁnd that the simulation results of A0(td) and of the diﬀerence of A0.002(td) − A0(td) for α = 2.7 from the event sequences generated using the copula-based algo- rithm are comparable to our analytical result in Eq. (34), as evidenced in Fig. 2(c,d). Note that M = 0.002 means r = M/a ≈ 0.60. The discrepancy for the diﬀerence of A0.002(td)−A0(td) between the analytical and simulation results might be attributed to the ﬁnite τc and/or n. Finally, we discuss the eﬀect of M on the overall de- caying behavior of AM (td). We make two observations in Eq. (33): (i) The leading term coupled with M is either of the order of t −α d for 1 < α < 3/2 or of the or- der of t−(3−α) d for 3/2 < α < 2, and the coeﬃcient of this M -coupled leading term is positive, i.e., C1 > 0 for 1 < α < 3/2 and C2 > 0 for 3/2 < α < 2. This indicates that AM (td) for M > 0 begins with a larger value than that of A0(td) for small td. (ii) Such M -coupled leading term, t −α d or t−(3−α) d , decays faster than the leading term for M = 0, which is of the order of t −(2−α) d . This implies that AM (td) for M > 0 eventually approaches A0(td) for suﬃciently large td. Combining these two observations, we conclude that the stronger correlation between IETs with the larger M results in the steeper decay of AM (td), despite the fact that AM (td) for M > 0 is always larger than A0(td). This analytical expectation is consistent with the simulation results as depicted in Fig. 3(a). We also observe the similar behavior in Eq. (34) such that the M -coupled leading term of t−(α−1) d has the positive coeﬃcient (C ′ 1 > 0) and decays faster than the leading term for M = 0 of the order of t−(α−2) d . The tendency of the steeper decay for the larger M is evident in the sim- ulation results, see Fig. 3(b). Therefore, if the value of decaying exponent is naively estimated using the simple scaling form as AM (td) ∼ t−γM d , (35) one may ﬁnd an increasing tendency of the apparent decaying exponent γM with M . This tendency is nu- merically conﬁrmed for both cases with 1 < α < 2 and 2 < α < 3, as shown in Fig. 3(c). It is remarkable from both analytical and simulation results that even a lit- tle amount of the correlation between IETs can change the apparent decaying exponent γM , implying that the scaling relations in Eq. (4) can be easily violated by the correlations between IETs. III. CONCLUSION In order to investigate the eﬀects of correlations be- tween interevent times (IETs) on the autocorrelation function, we have derived the analytical form of the au- tocorrelation function for the arbitrary IET distribution P (τ ) and for small values of the memory coeﬃcient M , i.e., in the case with weakly correlated IETs, where the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula [36, 37] is adopted for modeling the joint probability distribution function of two consecutive IETs. For the numerical validation, the event sequences are generated using the copula-based al- gorithm [40], by which IETs can be drawn sequentially only conditioned by their previous IETs. For both ex- ponential and power-law IET distributions, we ﬁnd that the simulation results of autocorrelation functions are in good agreement with the corresponding analytical solu- tions. In particular, for the power-law case, we ﬁnd that the stronger correlation between IETs with the larger M leads to the steeper decay of the autocorrelation func- tion. In other words, the apparent decaying exponent γ is found to increase with M . Our ﬁnding sheds light on the 6 eﬀects of correlations between IETs on other measures for temporal correlations too, such as Hurst exponent H and the scaling exponent of the power spectral density η, considering their interdependence [7, 8, 15, 16]. We also expect to better understand the diﬀerences between the empirical autocorrelation functions and those calculated for the randomized event sequences [9, 16] based on our results. Finally, our results also support the previous nu- merical ﬁnding on the increasing tendency of γ for the stronger correlation between IETs [17], where the corre- lations between IETs have been controlled by the power- law exponent of bursty train size distributions. Here we like to note that the bursty train size distribution and M have been related to each other [41]. We remark that our analytical approach has limits as follows: (i) We have considered only the correlations be- tween two consecutive IETs based on the empirical ﬁnd- ings, while the correlations between the arbitrary num- ber of consecutive IETs have also been empirically ob- served in terms of heavy-tailed distributions of bursty train sizes [9, 10, 33]. This requires us to devise the more general analytical approach than ours as a future work. (ii) The FGM copula allows only relatively weak correla- tions between IETs, requiring us to consider other cop- ulas for the cases with the stronger correlation between IETs [36]. Despite such limits, our analytical approach can help us to better understand the long-term tempo- ral correlations ubiquitously observed in various natural and social phenomena, as yet little is known about the eﬀects of the correlations between IETs on the long-term temporal correlations.
