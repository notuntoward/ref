As rechargeable batteries, lithium-ion batteries serve as power sources in various application systems. Temperature, as a critical factor, signiﬁcantly impacts on the perfor- mance of lithium-ion batteries and also limits the application of lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, diﬀerent temperature conditions result in diﬀerent adverse eﬀects. Accurate measurement of temperature inside lithium- ion batteries and understanding the temperature eﬀects are important for the proper battery management. In this review, we discuss the eﬀects of temperature to lithium-ion batteries at both low and high temperature ranges. The current approaches in monitoring the internal temperature of lithium-ion batteries via both contact and contactless processes are also discussed in the review. 1. Introduction Electrochemical batteries, ﬁrst invented by Alessandro Volta in 1800 [1–4], have become one of the necessities in human’s life. Elec- trochemical batteries can be classiﬁed into primary batteries and sec- ondary batteries [5–7]. Primary batteries are used only once and cannot be recharged, which is due to the irreversible electrochemical reactions occurring in the batteries. Zinc–carbon batteries are one of the re- presentative primary batteries [8,9]. On the contrary, secondary bat- teries, which are also called rechargeable batteries, are electrochemical batteries that can be cyclically reused by discharging and recharging. Such reusable function originates from the reversible electrochemical reactions that occur in the batteries. Although primary batteries hold the major part of the commercial battery market, there are challenges associated with the use of primary batteries, including the generation of large amounts of unrecyclable materials, and the toxic components in the batteries that post environmental concerns [10–12]. The develop- ment of secondary batteries rises rapidly, including the development of nickel–metal hydride batteries [13–15], lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [16–18], and sodium-ion batteries [19–21]. Among these secondary batteries, LIBs, which exhibit high energy density and excellent working performance [22–25], are leading the current secondary battery market and widely used in many diﬀerent areas. The ﬁrst commercial LIB, introduced by Sony Corporation in 1991 [26,27], led a revolution of the battery market. A common LIB consists of lithium compound-based cathode, carbon-based anode, electrolyte and separator. In general, the cathode materials are coated on an alu- minum foil and the anode materials are coated on a copper foil, re- spectively. The aluminum and copper serve as the current collectors. A piece of porous polymer separator that is immersed in electrolyte and sandwiched between the anode and cathode prevents the shorting of the two electrodes (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, lithium ions go through the cycles of intercalation and deintercalation, and shuttle through the electrolyte as charge carriers in the internal circuit. With the intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions, redox reactions occur at the electrodes, which generate electrons that move direction- ally through the external circuit to form the current. The following equations show the redox reactions occurring at LiFePO4 cathodes (Eq. (1)) and carbon anodes (Eq.

T known as charging or discharging rate, is referred as C rate, which is deﬁned as the charging or discharging current divided by the capacity of LIBs. Due to the high energy density (up to 705 Wh/L [28]) and power density (up to 10,000 W/L [29]), high voltage capability [30] and great cycling performance [31], LIBs are used as power sources in numerous electronic products [32,33], electric vehicles [25,34], energy storage systems [35,36] as well as in military and aerospace applications [37,38]. The LIBs, however, are still facing barriers that limit their applica- tion space [18,41]. One of the major limitations is the impact of tem- perature to the proper operation of the LIBs. Generally, the acceptable temperature region for LIBs is −20 °C ~ 60 °C [42]. Pesaran et al. [43] showed that the optimal temperature range for LIBs is 15 °C–35 °C. Once the temperature is out of these comfortable regions, LIBs will degrade fast with increased risk of facing safety problems that include ﬁre and explosion. In general, impacts from temperature can be divided into two categories: low temperature eﬀects and high temperature ef- fects [44–47]. Low temperature eﬀects mostly take place in high-latitude country areas, such as Russia, Canada and Greenland Island [48,49]. In these areas, the outdoor temperatures in winter are much lower than 0 °C. Such low temperatures will aﬀect the performance and life of LIBs, especially for those used in pure electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) [48,50]. Another cold environment that involves the use of LIBs is the outer space. For example, the temperature on Mars [51] can be as low as −120 °C, which poses serious challenge to the use of LIBs in astro- vehicles for space exploration. At these low operating temperatures, LIBs will show slow chemical-reaction activity and charge-transfer ve- locity [42], which leads to the decrease of ionic conductivity in the electrolytes [52] and lithium-ion diﬀusivity within the electrodes [53]. Such decrease will result in the reduction of energy and power cap- ability, and sometimes even performance failure. Compared to the low temperature eﬀects that are mostly limited to the low temperature application environments, the high temperature eﬀects happen in a much broad range of application environments, including not only high temperature environments but also low tem- perature environments. The environmental temperature plays a critical role in low temperature eﬀects, while most of time high temperature eﬀects are attributed to the high internal temperature of LIBs during operation rather than the environmental temperature. The high internal temperature is caused by heat generation inside the LIBs, which hap- pens at high current state, including operations with fast charging rate and fast discharging rate [54,55]. The high temperature eﬀects will also lead to the performance degradation of the batteries, including the loss of capacity and power [56–59]. Generally, the loss of lithium and the reduction of active materials under high temperature will result in the loss of the capacity [60], while the increase of internal resistance is responsible for the loss of power [61]. If the temperature is out of control, thermal runaway will be triggered, which may lead to self- ignition and even explosion in some cases [62,63]. Proper management of the operating temperature of LIBs is thus critical to the performance and safe operation of the batteries. Accurate temperature monitoring of LIBs is one of the important processes in proper temperature management. It is, however, diﬃcult to monitor the temperature distribution inside the batteries, which are tightly sealed during operation. In this review, we will overview both the adverse eﬀects of temperature to LIBs, and the diﬀerent approaches in mon- itoring internal temperature of LIBs. 2. The eﬀects of temperature to LIBs Most of the temperature eﬀects are related to chemical reactions occurring in the batteries and also materials used in the batteries. Regarding chemical reactions, the relationship between the rate of chemical reactions and reaction temperature follows Arrhenius equa- tion, and temperature variation can lead to the change of electro- chemical reaction rate in batteries [64]. Besides chemical reactions, the ionic conductivities of electrodes and electrolytes are also aﬀected by temperature. For example, the ionic conductivity of lithium salt based electrolytes decreases at low temperatures [65]. With these eﬀects in concern, the LIBs used in EVs and HEVs can hardly meet the expecta- tion of a 10-year life suggested by the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) [66]. In the following sections we will discuss both the low temperature eﬀects and the high temperature eﬀects on the LIBs. 2.1. Low temperature eﬀects The performance of LIBs will degrade at temperatures below 0 °C [48,67]. In 2001, Nagasubramanian showed that the power and energy densities of Panasonic 18650 LIBs were ~800 W/L and ~100 Wh/L at 25 °C, and these values were reduced by 98.75% and 95% to < 10 W/L and ~5 Wh/L at −40 °C [68]. In another report, the state of charge (SOC) of a LIB, which is deﬁned as the ratio of the present residual capacity to the overall available capacity [69], was also found to de- crease by ~23% when the operating temperature decreased from 25 °C to −15 °C [70]. With the complex material system used in LIBs, the performance degradation at low temperatures can be attributed to several diﬀerent sources. First, the low temperature will aﬀect the property of electro- lyte. With the decrease of temperature, the viscosity of the electrolyte will increase, which will reduce the ionic conductivity. The internal resistance will subsequently rise due to the increase in the impedance of the directional migration of chemical ions. To counter such eﬀect, Fig. 1.

Progress in Natural Science: Materials International 28 (2018) 653–666 654 electrolytes with low freezing point were explored, and diﬀerent elec- trolyte additives were studied [51,71–74]. Bugga et al. [51] presented a guideline for developing formulations of low temperature electrolytes during their research of LIBs for space applications. The improved electrolytes can be used in an extended operating temperature range (Fig. 2A) and were proved to be eﬀective in aerospace batteries. Li et al. [75] also reported an optimized electrolyte formulation of 1.0 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate(EC)−propylene carbonate(PC)−ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:8 by wt) with 0.05 M CsPF6. Such formulation enabled a capacity retention of 68% for the batteries tested at −40 °C, while the ones with conventional formulation only showed a capacity retention of 20% (Fig. 2B). Speciﬁc electrolyte additives, such as li- thium diﬂuorophosphate (LiPO2F2), were also proved to be eﬀective in improving the performance of LIBs at low temperature (Fig. 2C) [74]. The increase of charge-transfer resistance in LIBs is also an im- portant factor that contributes to the performance degradation at low temperatures. The charge-transfer resistance of LiFePO4-based cathodes at −20 °C was reported to be three times higher than that at room temperature [76]. Such high charge-transfer resistance largely aﬀects the kinetics in batteries. The study of LIB performance at low tem- peratures by Zhang et al. [77] demonstrated that the charge-transfer resistance signiﬁcantly increased when the temperature decreased. The charge-transfer resistance of a discharged battery normally is much higher than that of a charged one. Charging a battery at low tempera- tures is thus more diﬃcult than discharging it. Additionally, perfor- mance degradation at low temperatures is also associated with the slow diﬀusion of lithium ions within electrodes. Such slow down can be countered by altering the electrode materials with low activation en- ergy. For example, Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP), which has an activation energy of 6.57 kJ mol–1, showed a 200x improvement of apparent chemical diﬀusion coeﬃcient of lithium ions over LiFePO4 (LFP) with an acti- vation energy of 47.48 kJ mol–1 at −20 °C [78]. Another typical eﬀect that occurs at low temperatures is lithium plating [79–81]. The cold condition will trigger the polarization of anodes and lead to the approach of the potential of graphite and other carbon based anodes to that of lithium metal, which would slow down the lithium-ion intercalation into the anodes during charging process [82]. The aggregated lithium ions are thus deposited on the surface of the electrodes, which causes the reduction of the battery capacities. Furthermore, the lithium plating exists in the form of dendrite, which may penetrate the separators, and result in the internal short-circuit [83]. 2.2. High temperature eﬀects The eﬀects at high temperatures are much more complex than those at low temperatures. During the operation of the LIBs, heat is generated inside the batteries, and understanding the heat generation is critical in minimizing the high temperature eﬀects in LIBs. 2.2.1. Heat generation In general, the heat generation within the LIBs at normal tempera- ture is associated with charge transfer and chemical reactions during charging and discharging [84,85]. The heat is generated either in the reversible process or the irreversible process in LIBs [84,86–88]. Fig. 3 shows the possible heat generation within LIBs. The heat generated in the reversible process, also known as entropic heat, originates from the reversible entropy change during electrochemical reactions [89]. There Fig. 2.

Copyright: 2014, Elsevier. S. Ma et al. Progress in Natural Science: Materials International 28 (2018) 653–666 656 are many possible irreversible processes that can generate heat, in- cluding active polarization process, ohmic heating process, heating due to mixing and enthalpy change [90–92]. The polarization is resulted from the overpotential between operating potential and open circuit potential of the batteries. It leads to the increase of charge transfer resistance at electrode-electrolyte interface, or Solid Electrolyte Inter- face (SEI). When lithium ions overcome such resistance at interface for their intercalation/deintercalation, heat is produced [93]. The ohmic heating process occurs in both the electrode and electrolyte. It is due to the resistance of electrodes and electrolytes that hinders the transpor- tation of charges [85,94]. When the LIBs are in operation, either in charging or in discharging, the ion distribution becomes in- homogeneous, which can lead to the mixing of ions and the generation of heat during mixing [84,95]. Another form of irreversible process that generates heat is the enthalpy change due to phase change in cathodes, which is primarily due to the diﬀusion of lithium ions [96]. 2.2.2. Aging Aging is an eﬀect during the application of LIBs at high temperatures. Aging not only aﬀects the performance of LIBs, but also reduces their lifetime. In general, the aging of LIBs includes cycle aging and calendar aging [97,98]. These two types of aging, however, always occur in combination due to the complex composition and working process of LIBs [99]. Increasing the operating temperature of LIBs above the optimal scope will accelerate the aging process and lead to the degradation of LIBs. Most of research in this area focuses on aging of either the individual components inside the battery [100,101] or the battery system [102,103]. For the thermal aging eﬀects on individual components, the studies mostly center on electrodes and electrolytes. Gabrisch et al. [101] studied the capacity change of LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4 cathodes. The LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4 cathodes went through thermal aging at 75 °C for 10 days and 6 days, respectively. The discharge proﬁles of these two cathodes showed the severe loss of capacity after aging treatment (Fig. 4A and B). The authors indicated that the thermal-induced crys- tallographic transformation led to an irreversible intercalation of li- thium ions into cathode lattices, which resulted in the loss of capacity of the cathodes. Handle et al. [104] studied the decomposition of lithium hexaﬂuorophosphate (LiPF6), which is a commonly used conductive salt in electrolytes, under thermal aging. With the existence of proton impurities, the decomposition of LiPF6 is enhanced at high temperature. Fig. 4C shows the decomposition pathway of LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethylene carbonate (DEC) (1:2, v-v) at 60 °C, which led to the formation of diﬂuorophosphoric acid as the main decomposition product. Compared to the studies of individual components, studies of the entire battery system provide a more comprehensive demonstration of high temperature aging eﬀects of LIBs. Bodenes et al. [102] studied the aging process of Li(Ni, Mn, Co)O2 (NMC)-based LIBs. Fig. 5A shows that the loss of capacity of the tested battery was 7.5% when it was cycled at 85 °C, while it reached to 22% when cycled at 120 °C. By characterizing the change of binder and SEI during aging process with various char- acterization methods, they provided two possible reasons for the aging degradation. On one hand, the polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) binder migrated to the surface of anodes and impeded the intercalation of li- thium ions. On the other hand, the carbonates species disappeared and inorganic species increased at the SEI layers at high temperature, which led to the increase of impedance inside the batteries. Based on the electrochemistry-based electrical (ECBE) model, Leng et al. [105] in- vestigated the temperature eﬀect on the rate of capacity degradation of a Sony Prismatic LIB during aging from 25 °C to 55 °C (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5B, elevating temperature in the tested range partially increased the capacity of battery, but it also accelerated the rate of degradation of capacity during cycling. The increase of degradation rate was mainly ascribed to the degradation of electrodes, where the phase change and surface modiﬁcation were aggravated at high temperatures. 2.2.3. Thermal runaway Thermal runaway may happen when the batteries are manufactured defectively or handled improperly. Thermal runaway often occurs at high temperature states, in which the high temperature triggers the exothermic reactions in the operating batteries [63]. These reactions release more heat, and in turn further promote the increase of tem- perature within the batteries [106]. When such uncontrolled heat generation exceeds the heat endurance of the batteries, ﬁre and ex- ploration would occur [63]. Many notebook manufacturers such as Apple and Lenovo recalled their products and suﬀered huge ﬁnancial losses in the past decades due to thermal runaway issues [107,108]. Hence, understanding the thermal runaway of LIBs is important to the thermal management of batteries at high temperatures. Finegan et al. [109] ﬁrst introduced the technology of in-operando high-speed synchrotron X-ray computed tomography and radiography into the diagnosis of thermal runaway behaviors of commercial 18650 LIBs (Fig. 6A). With the simulation of the thermal condition using a heat gun, thermal runaway occurred when the temperature of battery Fig. 5.

With the propagation of thermal runaway, the electrodes decomposed and gas ﬂew through the vent continuously, resulting in the collapse of internal structures. In the later period of thermal runaway, the copper foil also melted and turned into globules. This phenomenon indicated that the local internal temperature even exceeded 1000 °C, since the melting point of copper is 1085 °C. This work provided a novel approach in studying the thermal failure me- chanism of LIBs. In addition to the damage of materials and structures in the bat- teries, many studies also focus on the process of thermal runaway [50,110]. Fig. 6B provides an example of thermal runaway process propagating with the increase of temperature [110]. In stage I, the loss of capacity occurs at elevated temperature. The decomposition of SEI happens after the temperature reaches 60 °C (stage II). Without the covering of SEI layers, the anodes directly contact with the electrolytes and react with them at 100 °C. This reaction is an exothermic reaction, Fig. 6. (A) Schematic of the in-operando experimental setup. (B) 3D reconstruction and the cutoﬀ top view of the tested cylindrical batteries.

Progress in Natural Science: Materials International 28 (2018) 653–666 658 which generates heat and promotes the elevation of temperature inside the batteries. Stage III starts with the melting of polyethylene (PE) se- parators at 130–140 °C, which leads to the micro internal shorting (stage IV) and the continuing rise of temperature. At this temperature condition, the decomposition of anodes continues and consumes the active materials in anodes. As the temperature reaches above 240 °C, the decomposition of cathode materials, electrolytes and binders oc- curs. Such series of chemical reactions produce large amounts of heat that rapidly increases the temperature to 800 °C or higher and leads to ﬁre with the existence of oxygen released by the cathode reactions. These reactions also generate other gaseous products, which increase the internal pressure of batteries, and may even result in unexpected exploration at high temperature. In this section, we overviewed the temperature eﬀects to LIBs, in- cluding both the low temperature eﬀects and the high temperature ef- fects. Those eﬀects not only lead to the degradation of performance in LIBs, but also may result in lithium plating and thermal runaway. These eﬀects indicate that the performance of LIBs is closely dependent on temperature. Monitoring of the temperature inside LIBs is therefore a critical process in minimizing temperature eﬀects.

Approaches for internal temperature monitoring of LIBs The distribution of temperature at the surface of batteries is easy to acquire with common temperature measurement approaches, such as the use of thermocouples and thermal imaging systems [111]. It is, however, challenging to use these approaches in monitoring the in- ternal temperature of LIBs. The self-production of heat during operation can elevate the temperature of LIBs from inside. The transfer of heat from interior to exterior of batteries is diﬃcult due to the multilayered structures and low coeﬃcients of thermal conductivity of battery components [112–114]. The spatial distribution of internal temperature is also uneven [83]. In consideration of the sealed nature and the electrochemical re- actions of LIBs during operation, researchers tried to explore diﬀerent approaches in monitoring the internal temperature of LIBs. As illu- strated in Fig. 7, these approaches can be classiﬁed into two main ca- tegories: contact measurement and contactless measurement. In contact measurement, temperature sensors such as thermocouples and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are inserted into LIBs to measure the temperature directly. In contrast, in the contactless measurement, the internal temperature was obtained indirectly without intruding into the batteries. Modeling simulation and electrochemical impedance are two major contactless approaches. In the modeling simulation, electro- chemical and thermal models were established to simulate the opera- tion of LIBs in diﬀerent situations and theoretically estimate the in- ternal temperature. Predicting the internal temperature using electrochemical impedance is another contactless method. The elec- trochemical impedance of LIBs is a temperature-dependent parameter. By establishing calibration curves of the relationships between im- pedance and temperature, the internal temperature of LIBs can be es- timated. In this section, we will discuss the present approaches for both contact measurement and contactless measurement of internal tem- perature of the LIBs. 3.1. Contact measurement Implanting thermal sensors into LIBs is the most direct way to measure the internal temperature. Li et al. [115] monitored the spatial and temporal variations of internal temperature of a laminated battery with pre-embedded thermocouples. The battery was operated at dif- ferent discharge rates and ambient conditions during the temperature measurement. Fig. 8A shows the locations of thermocouples within the tested batteries. The overlapping of discharge curves of batteries with and without embedded thermocouples indicated that the impact of the inserted sensors on the performance of batteries was negligible (Fig. 8B). When the battery discharged at the rate of 0.3C, the average temporal internal temperature under adiabatic condition gradually rose from 23.5 °C to 29 °C with the increase of discharging time (Fig. 8C). Diﬀerently, under natural convection condition, the temperature reached a peak value of 29 °C and decreased to a plateau of 25.5 °C during discharging (Fig. 8D). This diﬀerence indicates that natural convection can help establish an equilibrium between the generation and dissipation of heat within the batteries. The internal temperature at each location was generally higher than that at the surface, in which the maximum diﬀerence was 1.1 °C at location 2 (Fig. 8A) when the battery discharged at 1.5C rate under natural convection. Fig. 8E and F show the spatial distribution of internal temperature under adiabatic condi- tion and natural convection condition, respectively. Temperature gra- dients appeared from the top left to the bottom right spatially, in which the hot zones located closely to the anode tabs. This result was corre- sponding to the higher current densities near electrode tabs and the more heat generation at anode tabs than that at cathode tabs. This work provides a good example of monitoring the internal temperature of LIBs Fig. 9. (A) Radical distribution of temperature rise at the end of discharge at diﬀerent discharge rate.

It shows the inhomogeneous distribu- tion of temperature inside working LIBs, which also demonstrates the necessity of multi-point measurement. Zhang et al. [116] also measured the internal temperature of LIBs with embedded micro-thermocouples. Rather than using the laminated pouch battery, the battery they used for testing was a commercial 18650 cylindrical cell. The locations of thermocouples were along the radius of battery as shown in Fig. 9. The temperatures at these locations were examined under diﬀerent discharge rates, both at ambient tem- peratures and cooling conditions. The result in Fig. 9A indicates that higher discharge rate caused more generation of heat, and resulted in higher increase of temperature at each location and larger temperature gradient along the radius of the battery. Fig. 9B shows that the tem- perature gradient under lower ambient temperature increased faster than that under higher ambient temperature. Such diﬀerence was due to the more eﬃcient dissipation of heat at outer layers under low am- bient temperature conditions than under the high ambient temperature conditions. The forced convection cooling also led to larger temperature gradient than cooling by natural convection (Fig. 9C). In addition to thermocouples, other micro thermal sensors that can be integrated into LIBs are also capable of detecting the internal tem- perature of LIBs. Novais et al. [117] measured the temperature varia- tion of an assembled pouch battery under various operating conditions with FBG sensors. The measurement locations included two internal points and the corresponding external points (Fig. 10A). Fig. 10B and C show that the temperature ﬂuctuated up and down with the progress of operation. The temperature inside the battery varied, both temporally and spatially, much more than that at the surface. The maximum temperature diﬀerence (ΔT) increased with charge/discharge rate, in which the internal ΔT was as large as 4.7 °C at 8C rate (Fig. 10D). This work demonstrated that the variation of temperature was correlated to the state of applied voltage, with peaks appearing at the end of charge and discharge. Such temperature change was attributed to the fact that over charge and discharge, the ion distribution becomes in- homogeneous, which leads to heat generation. Implanting thermal sensors into LIBs is a feasible approach to monitor the internal temperature experimentally, as demonstrated in the above researches. It is, however, not suitable for practical appli- cations. Integration of thermal sensors is destructive to the structure of LIBs. Moreover, insulation layers are often needed to cover on the probes of thermal sensors [115,116,118] to minimize the disturbance of components within the batteries during measurement. These covering layers aﬀect the accuracy of measurement due to the thermal resistance from these insulation layers. 3.2. Contactless measurement In order to avoid the damage to the structure of li-ion batteries, contactless and nondestructive measurement is developed. Modeling simulation and electrochemical impedance-based process are two ty- pical approaches for contactless measurement of internal temperature of the LIBs. 3.2.1. Modeling simulation Recent researches on modeling simulation for estimating the in- ternal temperature of LIBs mainly include two types. One is the thermal model that simply concerns the thermal aspects inside batteries, while another one is the thermal-electric model that considers both the thermal and electric aspects. Forgez et al. [119] reported a re- presentative thermal model for cylindrical LIBs that can estimate the internal temperature from surface temperature. To make it compatible with the low computational resources of micro-controllers used in battery management systems (BMSs), Forgez et al. established their thermal model without coupling it with electrochemical models. Fig. 11A shows the completed thermal model of the tested battery based on the analysis of heat generation and heat transfer. The detailed parameters in the model, however, are too complex to be determined. By assuming that the internal temperature of the battery was uniformly distributed, authors proposed a simpliﬁed model as presented in Fig. 11B. With this simpliﬁed model, the internal temperature of cy- lindrical LIBs can be estimated as Fig. 10. (A) Schematic of the locations of FBG sensors.

(3), Tin, Tsurf and Tamb represent internal temperature, surface temperature, and ambient temperature, respectively. Rin and Rout are the thermal resistance inside and outside the batteries. To verify the accuracy of this equation, the estimated results of internal temperature were compared with the experimental results, which were obtained with inserted thermocouples. The overlapping of the estimated curve and measured curve in Fig. 11C proved the feasibility of this model, and the diﬀerence between the estimated temperature and the measured temperature was within 1.5 °C. Kim et al. [121] proposed another thermal model for cylindrical batteries that can estimate the distribution of internal temperature along radius of the batteries. Speciﬁcally, the authors pointed out that the information of the cooling condition to the batteries was also es- sential to the accurate estimation of internal temperature even though the surface temperature was known. With this thermal model, both the internal core temperature and convection coeﬃcient of the tested bat- tery were identiﬁed. The previous reports assumed that the internal temperature was uniform under certain thermal conditions. This work extended the modeling methods to accurately estimate the distribution of internal temperature of LIBs under unknown cooling conditions. Although the proposed thermal models can be used to predict the internal temperature to some extent, they do not take into account of the electric actions within the operating LIBs. The thermal process and electric process inside a working LIB are often coupled together. For example, the heat generation inside the LIBs is correlated with the internal resistance. The increase of the internal temperature can lead to the drop of the battery resistance, and in turn aﬀect the heat generation. The change of resistance will also aﬀect the battery power. Therefore, several researches paid attention to the establishment of thermal-elec- tric models that consider the interactions between thermal and elec- trical processes. Zhang et al. [120] reported a representative thermal- electric model that oﬀered a comprehensive description of the behavior of LIBs. In that work, they ﬁrst set up the electric submodel from the battery electric circuit model and also the thermal submodel from analysis of heat generation and transfer, respectively. To simplify the simulation, the heat generation and distribution of temperature within the battery were assumed to be uniform. Based on the shared para- meters, these two submodels were coupled together and the thermal- electric model was established. With this model, the authors evaluated the accuracy of the estimation of both internal and surface tempera- tures by using the test system shown in Fig. 11D. Fig. 11E shows the estimated results and measured results during a period of 30A current pulse. Both the curves of surface temperature and internal temperature exhibited good overlapping between estimated and measured results. A maximum temperature diﬀerence of 8 °C existed between the internal center and external surface of the battery. The modeling simulation extends the approaches to estimate the temperature inside LIBs with improving computational technologies, but it still has unavoidable deﬁciency. The complex conditions of LIBs during operation produce various intricate factors, which are diﬃcult to determine experimentally. Fig. 11.

Electrochemical impedance-based measurement Although it is challenging to directly measure the internal tem- perature of LIBs, it is relatively straightforward to measure the elec- trochemical impedance of LIBs by using common electrochemical workstations. Such impedance measurement provides an opportunity to indirectly obtain the information of temperature within LIBs. A cali- bration curve of impedance-temperature can be experimentally mea- sured, and the internal temperature can be derived from the calibration curve. The determination of electrochemical impedance is based on the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). EIS is a diagnostic method, in which a frequency-varying sinusoidal current is applied to the electrochemical system. The response of impedance variation to the frequency is then measured. The correlation of impedance, SOC and internal temperature of the tested LIBs can be obtained using EIS. The electrochemical impedance in LIBs is described in the form of complex number, which contains parameters such as real part, ima- ginary part and phase. Researchers often use one of these parameters to predict the internal temperature of LIBs. Schmidt et al. [122] estimated the internal temperature of a pouch battery by measuring the change of real part of electrochemical impedance. In addition to the temperature, the electrochemical impedance is also relevant to SOC in certain range of frequency. The frequency of sinusoidal current thus should be con- trolled to avoid the disturbance of SOC. Schmidt and co-workers used a thermal chamber to heat the battery to an equilibrium state at diﬀerent temperature conditions, and assumed the distribution of temperature in the entire battery to be uniform (Fig. 12A). Fig. 12B and C recorded the values of the real part of impedance under spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous temperature conditions. The temperature points were set as the mean values of Tsurf, top and Tsurf, bottom. The calibration curves were established by ﬁtting the acquired data points. The ﬁtted calibration curves were corresponding to a corrected Arrhenius equa- tion, in which the corrected error was related to the electric con- ductivity of the metallic collector. They reported that the precision of this proposed method reached ± 0.17K with known SOC status and ± 2.5K with unknown SOC status under isothermal conditions. Phase is another parameter of the electrochemical impedance that is relevant to the internal temperature and SOC of LIBs. Upon the change of temperature at certain frequency, the phase angle will shift in a predictable direction. By utilizing this correlation, Srinivasan et al. [123] quantized the relationship between phase shift and internal temperature of three types of LIBs. Similar to Schmidt’s work, the temperature of batteries was also controlled at the uniform state by a thermal chamber. The frequency of EIS was controlled in the range of 40–100 Hz. This range allowed the phase shift of the three batteries to be only dependent on the temperature. The phase shift upon tempera- ture change displayed an Arrhenius behavior from −20–66 °C, which showed a similar trend as the real part did in Schmidt’s work. The authors also pointed out that the temperature-dependent variation of impedance was relevant to the ionic conduction in the SEI layers. The behavior of SEI layers also plays a signiﬁcant role in analyzing the aging of LIBs. Therefore, these studies on predicting temperature from im- pedance measurement not only provide alternative approaches to the estimation of internal temperature, but also oﬀer feedback to the con- dition of SEI layers that may enable proper management of LIBs. The studies discussed above demonstrated the capability of esti- mating internal temperature using the parameters of electrochemical impedance. All the temperature states in experiments, however, are set to be the mean temperature. The distribution of temperature in LIBs in real applications is mostly uneven. Large diﬀerence exists between the maximum temperature and the mean temperature. To overcome this Fig. 12. (A) Schematic of the experimental setup. (B) Correlation between the real part of impedance and internal temperature under spatially homogeneous temperature conditions. (C) Correlation between the real part of impedance and internal temperature under spatially inhomogeneous temperature conditions. The temperature conditions were controlled by applying diﬀerent top and bottom heating parameters. The impedance was determined at a frequency of 10.3 kHz and a constant SOC of 50%.

[124] introduced a model that combined the impedance and surface temperature of LIBs together. The proposed thermal-impedance model was able to predict the temperature gradient along the radius of cylindrical batteries. Diﬀerent from the principles applied in traditional models, this method treated the cylindrical bat- tery using Calculus. In this model, the battery was split into in- ﬁnitesimal concentric annuli that were electrically connected, and each of the unit was temperature-dependent in radius. Detailed description about the model can be referred to Richardson’s work [124]. Fig. 13A shows the ﬂow of the modeling process. As the only required inputs were impedance and surface temperature, and no complex computed programming was needed, the model was simple enough to implement in BMSs. They also validated the model experimentally with a ther- mocouple-implanted cylindrical 26,650 battery by two heating ap- proaches: current pulse and a 3500 s HEV drive cycle current. Fig. 13B and C show the comparison between the modeling results and the ex- perimental results. The maximum temperature (Tmax , est) represented the modeling results with impedance measured at 215 Hz, while the equivalent uniform temperature (Tequiv) was derived from the mea- surement of corresponding impedance. The core temperature (Tcore) and surface temperature (Tsurf) were obtained by using thermocouples. Tmax , est and Tcore show a good consistency with each other, but Tequiv shows an obvious gap from them. The mean absolute error between Tmax , est and Tcore during the cycle test was 0.6 °C, while it increased to 2.6 °C if the distribution of internal temperature was considered uni- form and derived from impedance alone. 4. Conclusions Thermal challenges exist in the applications of LIBs due to the temperature-dependent performance. The optimal operating tempera- ture range of LIBs is generally limited to 15–35 °C. Both low temperature and high temperature out of this scope will aﬀect the performance and may cause irreversible change to the LIBs. At low temperatures, the degradation of performance is mainly caused by the reduction of ionic conductivity and the increase of charge-transfer re- sistance. Lithium plating is a speciﬁceﬀect that occurs on the surface of graphite and other carbon-based anodes, which leads to the loss of capacity at low temperatures. High temperature conditions accelerate the thermal aging and may shorten the lifetime of LIBs. Heat generation within the batteries is another considerable factor at high temperatures. With the stimulation of elevated temperature, the exothermic reactions are triggered and generate more heat, leading to the further increase of temperature. Such uncontrolled heat generation will result in thermal runaway. In this review, we also overviewed recent studies on the monitoring of the internal temperature of LIBs. Present approaches include contact measurement and contactless measurement. Contact measurement mainly includes the implantation of thermal sensors into LIBs, and contactless measurement includes modeling simulation and impedance- based estimation. Each of them, whether contact measurement or contactless measurement, has its own advantages and disadvantages. For the contact measurement by using micro-thermal sensors, it is feasible to achieve the spatial distribution of temperature by arranging multiple detectors at various locations in the batteries. The shortcoming of contact measurement is that implanting temperature probes will certainly lead to the destruction to the batteries, which will be chal- lenging to implement such approach in practical use. The delay of thermal transfer from hot spots to sensors and the insulation layer on the probes can also induce the measurement errors. These dis- advantages limit the application of the contact measurement ap- proaches. Modeling simulation and impedance-based estimation solve this problem by indirectly obtaining the internal temperature without intruding into the batteries. At present the temperature in most models Fig. 13. (A) Modeling process of real-time internal temperature estimation for LIBs.

Progress in Natural Science: Materials International 28 (2018) 653–666 664 are assumed to be uniform, while in reality the distribution of tem- perature in batteries is inhomogeneous. To control the operating temperature of LIBs and ensure the per- formance and safety, various battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) are designed for the thermal management of LIBs. For the batteries working under high temperature conditions, the current cooling strategies are mainly based on air cooling [125,126], liquid cooling [127,128] and phase change material (PCM) cooling [129,130]. Air cooling and liquid cooling, obviously, are to utilize the convection of working ﬂuid to cool the batteries. Generally, the heat transfer coeﬃcient of liquid is higher than that of air, making it more eﬃcient as the working medium and attracting more attentions of researchers. The PCM cooling is to use the phase change materials, of which the phase change point is within the desirable temperature scope of the LIBs, as the heat transfer mediums. Below the phase change point, the heat is conducted to PCMs and accumulated. When the temperature reaches the point, the mediums melt or vaporize and take away the heat from batteries. Compared to the various cooling systems, the heating strategies for LIBs need to be explored further. Several researches proposed heating methods through modeling simulation and experi- mental practice, such as internal heating resistance [131] and external preheating system [132,133]. So far these progresses of BTMSs are preliminarily able to counter the temperature eﬀects to LIBs, but still have a long way to go. The comprehensive study on the mechanism of thermal eﬀects and temperature monitoring inside LIBs may provide ideas theoretically and help to build up BTMSs systematically. Acknowledgements P.
