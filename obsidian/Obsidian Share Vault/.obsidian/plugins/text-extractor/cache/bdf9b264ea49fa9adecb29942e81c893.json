November 8, 2024 6 min 3675 By Scott Clement, Emily Guskin, Dan Keating and Júlia Ledur A key question heading into the 2024 election was whether Donald Trump could expand his base. The answer: Yes. On Tuesday, Trump made inroads with Hispanic voters, younger voters and voters without a college degree. At the same time, more than 80 percent of Trump’s voters are still White men and women. The Washington Post analyzed exit polling data since the 2000 presidential election to better understand how support for Republicans has changed among key voting demographics. The data from 2024 is preliminary. Here’s a look at some of the biggest swings in Trump’s support and how these groups have voted since 2000: A majority of Hispanic men voted for Trump Election 2024 Find results How Trump Won Presidential Results 2020 vs. 2024 Voter Turnout Sen Percentage point diﬀerence in votes by race and gender 2000 2024 2000 2024 2000 2024 2000 2024 2000 2024 2000 2024 White men White women Hispanic/Latino men Hispanic/Latino women Black men Black women DEM.

One of the most pronounced shifts in the 2024 election is the share of Hispanic men who backed Trump. Hispanic men supported Trump by a 12-point margin in this year’s presidential election, a steep increase from the past four presidential elections, when Hispanic men favored Democrats by more than 20 percentage points. Hispanic women did not move as strongly toward Trump, a majority still backed Vice President Kamala Harris. But Harris’s margin among Hispanic women shrank to 22 points; in 2020, they supported Biden by 39 points. If Trump’s share of 46 percent support among Hispanic voters holds in national exit polls, it would represent a record high for a Republican presidential candidate since 1980. Other groups did not shift as much this election. Black women and men supported Harris at similar rates that they supported Biden in 2020, though by smaller margins than for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Meanwhile, White men and women supported Trump by roughly the same margins as in 2020.

Men have historically supported the Republican presidential candidate in almost every election, and they supported Trump by a 13-point margin this year, up from eight points in 2020. Women, meanwhile, have tended to support the Democratic candidate, and a majority still supported Harris this year. But the margin by which women supported Harris was seven points narrower than Biden’s 15-point margin in 2020, which marked a record high for Democrats this millennium. The difference between Harris’s winning margin among women and Trump’s winning margin among men appears to be roughly the same as it was in 2020 and 2016.

A majority of younger voters still backed Harris, but it was Democrats’ weakest showing among voters under 30 since John Kerry’s nine-point margin in 2004. In total, voters under 30 shifted 13 points toward Trump since 2020. Another age group that moved toward Trump was voters between the ages of 45 and 64. They supported Trump by 10 points this year, after splitting their vote between Trump and Biden in 2020. Voters 65 and older are the one age group where Harris gained support, splitting their vote about evenly this year with Trump. This is especially notable as older voters have supported Republicans in the past five presidential elections.

Voters without college degrees supported Trump by a wider margin than any Republican since 1984. Trump won the group by 14 percentage points this year; four years ago, they roughly split their support between Biden and Trump. In many ways, education is the new dividing line of American politics, but it’s still a relatively new fault line. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, won voters without a college degree by an identical 14-point margin in 1996, while Ronald Reagan, a Republican, won the group by 19 points in his 1984 landslide election. Voters with college degrees supported Harris by 13 points, similar to four years ago when they supported Biden by 12 points.

Catholic voters favored Biden, the country’s second Catholic president, by five points in 2020 but swung sharply toward Trump this year, supporting him by 18 points. It’s the largest winning margin among Catholics for any candidate since exit polling began in 1972. That margin doesn’t yet rival Trump’s support among Protestants and other Christians. And there are still sharp divisions among Protestants: 82 percent of White evangelical Protestants supported Trump, while 55 percent of White non-evangelical Protestants and 85 percent of Black Protestants supported Harris. Voters with no religious affiliation bucked the national trend, supporting Harris by a 45-point margin, up from Biden’s 34-point advantage four years ago.

And this year they moved toward Trump by 10 points. Harris still won independents, but by just three points. In 2020, independent voters favored Biden by 13 points, by far the largest win among that group for any Democrat since 1976. This development is particularly significant given more Americans are identifying as independent. Independents made up 34 percent of voters this year, the largest share in exit polls dating back to 1972. They also made up a larger share than voters who identified as Democratic this year (31 percent), for the first time since 1972. And finally, for the first time since exit polling began, more voters identified as Republican, 35 percent. Methodology The 2024 network exit poll results are from interviews of 22,914 randomly selected voters as they exited voting places across the country on Nov. 5; as well as from early in-person voting locations and through live telephone, text-to-web or by email. The poll was conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool consortium of ABC News, CBS News, CNN and NBC News. Results are preliminary and will change as additional interviews are included and results are weighted to match vote tallies by region. Like other surveys, exit polls are subject to sampling error and other sources of error. Luis Melgar contributed to this report.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
