Rovisco Pais 1, 1049-001 Lisbon, Portugal bVeolia Recherche & Innovation, 291 Avenue Dreyfous Daniel, 78520 Limay, France cDépartement Systèmes Énergétiques et Environnement - IMT Atlantique, 4 rue Alfred Kastler, 44300 Nantes, France Abstract District heating networks are commonly addressed in the literature as one of the most effective solutions for decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector. These systems require high investments which are returned through the heat sales. Due to the changed climate conditions and building renovation policies, heat demand in the future could decrease, prolonging the investment return period. The main scope of this paper is to assess the feasibility of using the heat demand – outdoor temperature function for heat demand forecast. The district of Alvalade, located in Lisbon (Portugal), was used as a case study. The district is consisted of 665 buildings that vary in both construction period and typology. Three weather scenarios (low, medium, high) and three district renovation scenarios were developed (shallow, intermediate, deep). To estimate the error, obtained heat demand values were compared with results from a dynamic heat demand model, previously developed and validated by the authors. The results showed that when only weather change is considered, the margin of error could be acceptable for some applications (the error in annual demand was lower than 20% for all weather scenarios considered). However, after introducing renovation scenarios, the error value increased up to 59.5% (depending on the weather and renovation scenarios combination considered). The value of slope coefficient increased on average within the range of 3.8% up to 8% per decade, that corresponds to the decrease in the number of heating hours of 22-139h during the heating season (depending on the combination of weather and renovation scenarios considered). On the other hand, function intercept increased for 7.8-12.7% per decade (depending on the coupled scenarios). The values suggested could be used to modify the function parameters for the scenarios considered, and improve the accuracy of heat demand estimations. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, the localised distributed network will be more vulnerable in the front of large number of EVs as they are mainly connected to the local residential areas where the networks are sometimes heavily loaded. To cope with possible challenges and realise the optimal planning of distribution network with large penetration of EV, understanding their charging and discharging behaviour is the primary task. From the distribution planning perspective, EV can be characterized as a flexible and stochastic load that changes spatially and temporally across the power grid [1]. As the deployment of the EV is still in the early development stage, it is hard to obtain comprehensive historical data of electric vehicles, such as daily travel distance and the charging duration. Besides, EV charging demand is highly dependent on the owners’ habits and influenced by several random factors. Uncertainties should be dealt with carefully when establish the EV charging model. In this paper, a comprehensive probabilistic model considering the EV random impact factors is created. Three charging scenarios which cover the most typical scenarios, including peak charging, off-peak charging and V2G charging are proposed to predict the charging and discharging profiles. Then the case studies on a real UK distribution network will be carried out to assess the impact on the distribution network. Results can be used to provide the guidance for the future EV integration planning and optimisation. It should be noted although EV profiles in the paper are established on the basis of several assumptions, the method implemented and the analysis carried out below are applicable to other cases. 2. Determination of Critical Impact Factors For simplicity, all-electric vehicle，which is capable to complete a significant percentage of trips electrically and can be easily accepted by the market, is chosen as the electric vehicle type in this paper. EV is referred to all- electric EV hereinafter. For owner’s convenience, home charging will be the most common charging venue in the future. Therefore, it is assumed that EV charging solely occurs in EV owner's residence. Only single-phase EV connection is considered in the paper. EV power factor is set to 0.98 inductive. 2.1. EV battery type and capacity Lithium-ion is selected as it has a much longer lifetime and is capable of more charging cycles, which has been mainly applied to EV battery currently [2]. Since the behavior of the all-electric vehicle is studied and it is assumed that charging solely occur in the user's home above, three representative all-electric vehicle models of city cars that are currently on sale in the market are chosen for the typical EV load profile creation. They are Peugeot ION (16.5kWh), Volkswagen GOLF (26.5kWh) and Nissan LEAF (25kWh). As it is hard to predict the market share of each model, the battery capacity is randomly selected within three values in each iteration of the simulation. 2.2. EV charging rate and energy efficiency IEC 61581-1 standard defines three types of AC charging modes according to the rated charging voltage and current level. Slow charging mode is adopted in both domestic and public charging infrastructures, while both fast charging and rapid charging are only found in the public charging points which can provide much higher charging current [3]. Considering the real scenarios, it is more likely that the first users of EVs would be those who can charge at home or during the work with relatively longer charging time. Hence, slow charging mode is chosen to establish EV profiles. The average power demand of 3.5 kW, which is assigned to a typical EV power level in slow charging mode, is donated to the following model creation. Around 80% of the energy stored in the EV battery can be used to drive the wheels [4], which is the set value for charging efficiency in the following calculation. 2.3. Daily driving distance To create a probabilistic model that reflects the most likely behaviour of the EV load profile, the general pattern related to the mobility behaviour of the normal vehicles which is extracted from long-term traffic habits is relatively Qian Hu et al. / Energy Procedia 158 (2019) 6458–6465 6459 Available online at www.sciencedirect.com ScienceDirect Energy Procedia 00 (2018) 000–000 www.elsevier.com/locate/procedia 1876-6102 Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This scenario represents the worst case where no incentive to motivate the EV owner to charge their cars in the off-peak time. Economy 7 Charging: Electricity price is one of the factors that determine when customers would charge their cars. Economy 7 is a differential electricity tariff scheme offering cheaper off-peak electricity for 7 hours during the night in the UK [9]. Therefore, a desirable charging strategy which could be encouraged by lower off-peak electricity prices is proposed based on this tariff. From the perspective of EV owner, the objective of off-peak charging is to minimize the charging cost. In the simulation, it is assumed that the charging starts at a certain time between 11 pm and 2 am and can be lasted for the whole night. Such charging strategy could favour an effective utilization of electricity as EVs can be charged during the night off-peak periods. V2G Discharging & Charging: With the development of V2G technology, it is possible that EV could flexibly play the role of energy storage source. Therefore, V2G discharging strategy is proposed to simulate an ideal case that under large EV penetration, the excess electrical energy in the EV battery can be resent to the grid to support the peak demand. Specifically, it is assumed that EV users could discharge their EVs to the grid during the evening peak between 5 pm to 8 pm so that the load peak can be clipped. As the main incentive, they can earn the payback from the electricity they sell. However, the battery degradation is a concern that must be considered in the real life. To truly demonstrate the statistical distribution of EV charging and discharging data from 1000 times of simulations, boxplots are generated by MATLAB, which are shown in figure 6 (a)-(c).

This scenario represents the worst case where no incentive to motivate the EV owner to charge their cars in the off-peak time. Economy 7 Charging: Electricity price is one of the factors that determine when customers would charge their cars. Economy 7 is a differential electricity tariff scheme offering cheaper off-peak electricity for 7 hours during the night in the UK [9]. Therefore, a desirable charging strategy which could be encouraged by lower off-peak electricity prices is proposed based on this tariff. From the perspective of EV owner, the objective of off-peak charging is to minimize the charging cost. In the simulation, it is assumed that the charging starts at a certain time between 11 pm and 2 am and can be lasted for the whole night. Such charging strategy could favour an effective utilization of electricity as EVs can be charged during the night off-peak periods. V2G Discharging & Charging: With the development of V2G technology, it is possible that EV could flexibly play the role of energy storage source. Therefore, V2G discharging strategy is proposed to simulate an ideal case that under large EV penetration, the excess electrical energy in the EV battery can be resent to the grid to support the peak demand. Specifically, it is assumed that EV users could discharge their EVs to the grid during the evening peak between 5 pm to 8 pm so that the load peak can be clipped.

Case Study - Impact Assessment on Real LV Network A real low voltage network Denton East in England, which is modelled in OpenDSS, is used as the test network to integrate the various penetrations of EV. The network with rated 500 kVA capacity is supplying 296 domestic customers. It is expected the phase connected with EV would experience the most severe voltage drop. Hence, the phase denoting the minimum voltage (i.e., the phase connected with EV) is investigated for the interest. The lower voltage limit is set to 0.94 p.u, which is the minimum UK legal requirement. Results in terms of minimum voltage and peak power demand are recorded in table 1. The values in red represent that the voltage lower limit or power capacity for normal operating is violated. Power consumption profiles are shown in figure 7(a)-(c).

Only 20 % of customers can charge their EVs in the peak time simultaneously. For Economy 7 charging, 80% EV penetration level can be achieved. Peak power remains the same as the initial value until EV penetration level reaches to 40%. This is because the peak demand is still dominated by residential load under low EV penetration level. For V2G mode, figure 7(c) tells that power demand of the peak time is cut down due to the reversed power flowing into the network. Noticeably, the power curve is levelled off at 20% penetration so that a flat curve can be seen. The maximum penetration level is 50%. In addition, power factor and system efficiency of test network are also examined under three scenarios. The results show that power factor is decreased as EV can be regarded as the inductive load with power factor of 0.98 when it’s connected to the grid for charging. The system efficiency is poorer with the larger number of EVs. The utilisation level is defined as the ratio of the maximum apparent power through the asset and the rated capacity of the asset [10]. It provides an insight how different penetration level of EV affects the asset loading and the adequacy (capacity to supply the demand) of LV networks, which is shown in figure 8. Under V2G mode, the utilisation level is decreased but only when penetration is less than 20%. It is found the benefit of discharging process in V2G to reduce the congestion is limited comparing with E7 charging. To maximize the lifespan of the Fig. 7(a).

Therefore, the EV penetration level acquired here can be only taken as the reference. In real life, the number of EVs that can be connected to this distribution network will be less. Generally, real power losses are rising with the growing number of EVs. More power losses are generated under uncontrolled charging scenario at the same penetration level, which is shown in figure 9. If a network has a fixed total daily load, there would be fewer power losses of the network with a flatter the daily load curve [6]. In other words, much more power loss of the network will be produced if there is a larger difference between the peak and the valley power. As EV uncontrolled charging increases the gap between peak and valley, it results in more extra power losses. For V2G mode and E7 charging, the off-peak power valley is filled by EV charging demand so that the losses are reduced. Moreover, under V2G mode, the power curve is levelled off to a flatter curve when the penetration level is less than 30%. Therefore, slightly less power losses can be observed under V2G mode than E7 when penetration is lower that 30%. Three potential solutions towards distribution network management are discussed according to the acquired results. Additional investments for asset reinforcements can be made by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) to deal with the increasing penetration of EVs in the future. The straightforward solution is to install enough number of voltage regulators to maintain the voltage within the acceptable range, which is only applicable to the situation that EVs take account for a small proportion of the automotive sector. With the expanding number of EVs in the future, necessary smart actions are obliged to be taken by DNOs. From the simulation results, it has known electricity price could be a critical factor that influences the charging pattern of EV users and could reduce the potential peak stress significantly. Therefore, advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems for real-time pricing can be introduced [11]. By setting the real-time electricity structure, the load demand between peak time and off-peak time can be balanced dynamically to release the network congestion. Given that, EV charging loads within the household could be potentially controlled in a coordinated manner. Furthermore, aiming to control and predict the load patterns on the residential distribution networks, active demand side management should be developed. For example, the communication system between DNOs and EV drivers could be established. The individual battery charging process will be monitored and controlled to realize the optimization of the functioning of the distribution system. 5. Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, the impact factors of EV charging behaviour are discussed comprehensively. By using Monte Carol simulation method, EV load profile for three charging strategies: uncontrolled charging, Economy 7 charging and V2G mode are created considering the uncertainties. Their impacts on a real LV network are analysed with respect to thermal and voltage issues in OpenDSS and MATLAB at various EV penetration levels. The results show EV charging demand is detrimental to voltage deviation, asset congestion, system efficiency and power factor. The test network can accommodate the substantial penetration levels of EVs if the charging is restricted at off-peak time by the incentive tariff scheme. It should be noted that the results acquired in the paper are network-dependent and can be different from the results from other studies. Nevertheless, the conclusions achieved are general and can be applied to different circumstances. In terms of EV load profile creation, three improvements could be further implemented to create more comprehensive demand scenarios. Firstly, in addition to the city car model used in the paper, more different types of Fig. 8. Comparison of the utilisation level under three scenarios Fig. 9. Comparison of maximum real power losses under three scenarios 8 Qian Hu / Energy Procedia 00 (2018) 000–000 vehicle models with a wider range of battery capacity should be considered, for example, vans and SUVs. Secondly, the behaviour of commercial charging can be potentially combined with the residential charging which is the study focus in this paper. Thirdly, fast charging and rapid charging mode can be discussed considering a more flexible charging demand of different EV users in the future. Besides, more networks with various load patterns and system configuration can be studied.

Furthermore, aiming to control and predict the load patterns on the residential distribution networks, active demand side management should be developed. For example, the communication system between DNOs and EV drivers could be established. The individual battery charging process will be monitored and controlled to realize the optimization of the functioning of the distribution system. 5. Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, the impact factors of EV charging behaviour are discussed comprehensively. By using Monte Carol simulation method, EV load profile for three charging strategies: uncontrolled charging, Economy 7 charging and V2G mode are created considering the uncertainties. Their impacts on a real LV network are analysed with respect to thermal and voltage issues in OpenDSS and MATLAB at various EV penetration levels. The results show EV charging demand is detrimental to voltage deviation, asset congestion, system efficiency and power factor. The test network can accommodate the substantial penetration levels of EVs if the charging is restricted at off-peak time by the incentive tariff scheme. It should be noted that the results acquired in the paper are network-dependent and can be different from the results from other studies. Nevertheless, the conclusions achieved are general and can be applied to different circumstances. In terms of EV load profile creation, three improvements could be further implemented to create more comprehensive demand scenarios. Firstly, in addition to the city car model used in the paper, more different types of Fig. 8. Comparison of the utilisation level under three scenarios Fig. 9. Comparison of maximum real power losses under three scenarios 8 Qian Hu / Energy Procedia 00 (2018) 000–000 vehicle models with a wider range of battery capacity should be considered, for example, vans and SUVs. Secondly, the behaviour of commercial charging can be potentially combined with the residential charging which is the study focus in this paper. Thirdly, fast charging and rapid charging mode can be discussed considering a more flexible charging demand of different EV users in the future. Besides, more networks with various load patterns and system configuration can be studied.
