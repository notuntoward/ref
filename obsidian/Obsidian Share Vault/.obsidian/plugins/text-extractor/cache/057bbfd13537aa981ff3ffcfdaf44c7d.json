In the said domain, Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM) is an attractive method where aggregated load data is acquired at a single metering point and later-on segregated load consumption data has been acquired using different software techniques. This paper presents a low complexity event-based non-intrusive appliance load monitoring technique based on supervised machine learning. For disaggregation purposes, this paper emphases on air conditioning (AC) unit and Electric Vehicle (EV) charging load due to its high significance for the overall improvement of power grid stability. A comprehensive digital simulation has been carried out to validate the performance of the proposed approach and intended appliance are aptly classified having outcome of 97% for same Data ID and 95% for different Data ID in terms of precision, recall, and f-score performance metrics.

INTRODUCTION Electricity which plays a key role in this era has gone through a rapid transformation in terms of technologies in the last few decades. Today, with the growing emergence of prosumers1 and microgrids, the amount of electricity not produced by large traditional power plants is ever increasing2. But at the same time, high consumption loads like Air Conditioning (AC) units and Electric Vehicle (EV) charging becoming a significant load element for the existing power grid analysis [1, 2]. In the said scenario, smart grid offers many promising solutions like energy monitoring and demand response towards overall system efficiency and stability. With the worldwide deployment of smart meters, today it is more viable to monitor and understand the energy consumption and the corresponding behavior [3]. A comprehensive review of smart meter’s applications, methodologies and challenges have been recently presented in [4]. Today, smart meters are core component of energy monitoring and more specifically Non- Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM) systems. It is used to monitor and acquire the aggregate household load data for further processing towards energy disaggregation. NIALM system was first presented by Hart [5, 6] and is intended to identify the individual appliances’ consumption data from a given information of aggregated load consumption data. Recently numerous NIALM methods have been proposed, but in general, a traditional NIALM comprises three main 1 Customers who generate their own electricity, and can also utilize electric vehicles, battery storage etc. components namely, Data acquisition, Feature Extraction and Appliance Classification [7]. A comprehensive overview of the said components is presented in [8-10]. Fig. 1 presents the categorical as well as hierarchical details of a traditional NIALM system. Fig. 1. Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring System Further, based on the classification techniques, most of the proposed NIALM methods are categorized to either event- based or non-event based. A comparative overview of the said is presented in [11]. Recently many NIALM algorithms are proposed based on different approaches including but not limited to Optimization [12], Hidden Markov Models [13], and Neural Networks [14]. This paper proposes a low complexity non-intrusive appliance load monitoring approach for AC and EV charging status inference. The proposed approach relies on event-based low sampling NIALM system. Rest of the paper is organized as follows; Section II explains the details of the proposed event detection, feature extraction, and supervised machine learning. Sections III gives a brief overview of the digital simulation studies and the corresponding results. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section IV where Section V gives an insight into our future research work. II. PROPOSED APPROACH A. Problem Statement A time-series power load curve monitored at a metering point can be considered as an algebraic sum of n numbers of appliances’ load, as shown in (1) 2 According to International Energy Agency, in 2013 the renewables accounted for around 22% of worldwide electricity generation and it is predicted to reach at least 26% increase in 2020. Low Sampling Rate (≤ 1Hz) Data Acquisition Feature Extraction Appliance Classification High Sampling Rate (≥ 50Hz) Steady State Features Transient State Features Time & Freq. Domain V-I Load Classification Optimization Pattern Recognition Start-up Current Waveform Transient Power Power Change Voltage Noise Source Separation V-I Trajectory Supervised Machine Learning Unsupervised Machine Learning 𝑃𝑃𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎(𝑡𝑡) = ∑ 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡) 𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖=1 (1) In this paper, 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴(𝑡𝑡) + 𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑡𝑡) + 𝑛𝑛(𝑡𝑡) Where n(t) is the measurement noise that comprises of acquisition noise as well as other appliances’ load consumption that are not in the scope of this paper. So, the task of the proposed NIALM approach is to identify the state of individual appliance load i.e. 𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶(𝑡𝑡) and 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑡𝑡) with the only information of aggregated load i.e. 𝑃𝑃𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎(𝑡𝑡). B. Event Detection & Feature Extraction The aggregated power level depends on the individual appliances’ events and changes whenever an appliance turns ON or OFF. Generally, an event is a portion of a signal that deviates from previous steady state and lasts till next steady state [15]. Event detection algorithms are used to detect all the turning ON and OFF events of appliances within the aggregated load consumption data. Recently many event detection algorithms are proposed [16-18]. For this paper, we adopted the event detection algorithm namely Mean Sliding Window (MSW) algorithm [19] from our previous work with some further improvement in terms of post-processing step. The description of the improved MSW algorithm is as follow, Improved MSW Algorithm Input: Aggregated Load Data Output: Starting and Ending Time Indices of Detected Events 1. Acquire aggregated load consumption data 2. Process the acquired aggregated data using filtering techniques i.e. median filter 3. Select the sliding window width 4. Compute iteratively the mean of the power consumption curve and the corresponding difference 5. Select the threshold value for event detection 6. Using the selected threshold value, compute the signal representing the steady-state and transient states 7. Compute edges from the previous step using derivation function and extract the starting and ending indices of the detected events 8. Post-processing, i.e., event approval and delay correction due to window width The resulting consecutive starting and ending time instances are linked together to obtain the transient portion of the signal referred as an event (either turning-ON or turning-OFF3). Later, features are extracted from each detected event i.e. transient portion of the pre-processed aggregated load consumption data. Feature Set ‘ℱ’ selected in this study is based on geometrical features (transient width ‘𝜏𝜏𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡ℎ’), power changes (peak to peak power ‘𝑃𝑃𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝’), and statistical features (standard deviation ‘𝜎𝜎’, variance ‘ 𝜎𝜎2’, and mean value ‘𝜇𝜇’) as shown in (2). ℱ = �𝜏𝜏𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ, 𝑃𝑃𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝, 𝜎𝜎, 𝜎𝜎2, 𝜇𝜇, � (2) 3 Appliance turning-ON and turning-OFF are considered as distinct events having their own starting and ending time instances respectively. 4 Ground-truth or labelled data is mandatory for supervised machine learning. C. Classification The extracted features from each of the detected events are used as an input to the classification stage. In this paper, supervised machine learning has been used to identify the appliances. Supervised machine learning requires a training phase where both the aggregated and labeled ground-truth data are required for training purpose. Numerous supervised machine learning algorithms namely Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Regression etc. are available in the literature. This paper adopted kNN for inference purposes because it is one of the simplest and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm. kNN is a non-parametric method, which remembers the complete training data and performs classification only if the features of the testing data exactly match one of the training data [20]. Three key elements of this method are, a set of labeled objects, a distance or similarity metric to compute the distance between objects, and the value of k i.e. number of nearest neighbors. To identify an unlabeled object, compute the distance of this object to the labeled objects, its k-nearest neighbors are identified, and the class labels of these nearest neighbors are then used to determine the class label of the object. kNN is briefly discussed in [20], where a high-level summary of kNN algorithm is as follow, k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm INPUT 𝑫𝑫, set of 𝒌𝒌 training objects, and test object 𝒛𝒛 = (𝒙𝒙′, 𝒚𝒚′) PROCESS Compute 𝒅𝒅(𝒙𝒙′, 𝒙𝒙), the distance between 𝒛𝒛 and every object, (𝒙𝒙, 𝒚𝒚) ∈ 𝑫𝑫. Select 𝑫𝑫𝒛𝒛 ⊆ 𝑫𝑫, the set of 𝒌𝒌 closest training objects to 𝒛𝒛. OUTPUT 𝒚𝒚′ = 𝒂𝒂𝒂𝒂𝒂𝒂𝒂𝒂𝒂𝒂𝒙𝒙𝒗𝒗 � 𝑰𝑰(𝒗𝒗 = 𝒚𝒚𝒊𝒊) (𝒙𝒙𝒊𝒊,𝒚𝒚𝒊𝒊)∈𝑫𝑫𝒛𝒛 Where 𝑣𝑣 is a class label, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 is the class label for the ith nearest neighbors, and 𝐼𝐼(. ) is an indicator function that returns the value 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise [20]. III. SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS To validate the proposed approach, comprehensive digital simulation studies have been carried out. In terms of data acquisition, the aggregated and ground-truth 4 data have been acquired from a real-world dataset known as Dataport5 [21]. Dataport is the largest energy disaggregation data source owned and operated by Pecan Street Inc. Dataport comprises of electricity data of 722 houses in the United States of America that includes 501 single-family homes, 35 town homes, 3 mobile homes, and 183 apartments in different cities [22]. Each household in the Dataport comprises of aggregated average power consumption data along with individual appliances’ power consumption data and the corresponding ground-truth 5 https://dataport.cloud/ power signals respectively. Further details in terms of installed meters along with the installation dates, number of appliances, monitored building construction date, and different house sizes are given in [22]. During this research work, MATLAB® is used as a simulation tool for event detection and feature extraction. In terms of event detection, as discussed before MSW algorithm is used with some improvement in terms of post-processing steps. The parameters used for the event detection are kept same as presented in [19] except the input data sample size has been increased by 15 times to support the effectiveness of the proposed method. The said parameters are presented in Table I. TABLE I. EVENT DETECTION PARAMETERS Data Granularity 1/60 Hz Data ID 26 Data Timeframe 18 th June 2014 – 02 nd July 2014 No. of Data Samples 21600 (15 Days) Pre-Processing Technique Median Filtering Window Width 5 Samples Threshold Value 250 W Based on the parameters presented in Table I, simulation studies are carried out resulting in the starting and ending time instances of the detected events within the preprocessed acquired aggregated load data. Fig. 2 presents a portion (for better visualization) of the corresponding results. Fig. 2. (a) Preprocessed acquired aggregated load data and corresponding detected events in blue and red color respectively, (b) Ground-truth signal of AC and EV appears in dark cyan and orange color respectively along with the events detected by MSW algorithm appearing in black color It is obvious from the results presented in Fig. 2 that mostly high consumption peaks in the preprocessed aggregated load data are effectively detected comparatively to the lower variation in the aggregated load data. It is anticipated and essential due to the pre-defined parameters presented in Table I mainly threshold value and data granularity [23] of 250W and 1/60 Hz respectively.Further, from the presented results, it can be realized that the detected events 6 are well aligned with the ground-truth power signals of the appliances i.e. AC and EV. For parameters presented in Table I, total 323 events were detected by MSW algorithm. For later stage of classification via kNN algorithm, features need to be extracted from the detected event. Here five different features as discussed in (2) are extracted for each detected event that leads to a feature set 6 For the results starting time instances of the detected events are considered because it is the starting time that initiates the event regardless whether an appliance is turning ON or OFF. having 323×5 entries. A fragment of the said feature set is presented in Table II. TABLE II.

For classification purpose, Scikit-learn which is a machine learning library for Python programming language is used as a simulation tool. Scikit-learn comprises numerous classification, regression, and clustering machine learning algorithms. Within the scope of this paper, kNN is used as a classification algorithm. The extracted features and label data are the key inputs to the kNN algorithm. The classifier is trained via the aforementioned extracted features and label data. Once the classifier is trained, it is ready to classify the testing data. In this paper, to validate the results, the trained classifier is tested rigorously on the same as well as different data ID at different timeframes respectively. The details of the training as well as, testing data and the corresponding event detection result is presented in Table III. TABLE III.

Ground-Truth Signal & Detected Events The Precision and Recall along with the used terminologies of True Positive, False Positive, and False Negative are well defined in [19]. Before classification of the individual appliances’ status in the testing data via kNN, the selection of k-value is of utmost importance for best classification accuracy. To select the optimal k-value for each testing data, elbow method is applied independently for each testing data i.e. Data ID 26 and 3036 respectively. Fig. 3 presents the corresponding results in terms of k-value vs. misclassification error rate for testing data ID 3036 using elbow method. Fig. 3. Selection of Optimal k-value for Data ID 3036 Similarly, optimal value for other testing data is extracted via the elbow method. Finally, optimal k-values selected are 3 and 2 for Data ID 26 and 3036 respectively. Based on the optimal k-values, kNN classifier is used to classify the states of individual appliances i.e. AC and EV for different Data IDs. Due to space contraint, results presented in this paper are limited to only one testing data i.e. Data ID 26. Fig. 4 present the confusion matrix in form of a heatmap for individual appliances’ predicted status by kNN vs the ground-truth status of the corresponding appliance. Fig. 4. Confusion Matrix for Data ID 26 The results presented in Fig 4 are further explored in Fig. 5 where the classification of individual appliances’ states by kNN vs the ground-truth ia presented date-wise. Fig. 5. Date-wise Classification Results for Data ID 26 From Fig. 4, it is observed that most of the appliances’ states are classified precisely except few misclassification where AC turn-ON and turn-OFF are misclassified as EV turn-ON and OFF respectively. Similarly, an EV turn-ON is predicted incorrectly as an AC turn-ON. It is further concluded from Fig. 5 that all of the aforementioned misclassification occurred on day three i.e. Sunday, August 03, 2014. Likewise, the appliances’ states for another testing data i.e. Data ID 3036 are classified using kNN. Table IV presents the corresponding results for individual appliances’ states in terms of performance metrics namely, precision, recall and f-score. TABLE IV. INDIVIDUAL APPLIANCES’ CLASSIFICATION RESULTS From Table IV, it is observed that the classification results in terms of EV turning-On and turning-OFF is not upto the mark in comparison to AC turning-ON and turning-OFF. This is because of the less number of EV turning-ON and turning-OFF events, hence the classifier is not trained enough for the said events. Further, Table V presents the overall classification results for the testing data i.e. Data ID 26 and 3036 in terms of precision, recall, and f-score.

CONCLUSION This paper introduces a low complexity non-intrusive load monitoring approach for AC and EV charging. The proposed NIALM approach is event-based and works well for low sampling data granularity. This paper also proposed some improvements in MSW algorithm in terms of post-processing step to improve event detection accuracy. In terms of feature extraction, this paper utilizes a hybrid feature set based on power changes, geometrical, and statistical features of the detected events. Based on the extracted features of detected events, a supervised machine learning namely kNN algorithm (with optimal k-values using elbow method) is applied to aptly classify the states of the appliances under consideration. The overall approach is evaluated using different performance metrics and it is concluded that the proposed approach performs well. V. FUTURE WORK This is an ongoing research as part of a doctoral degree and our research on NIALM systems is still in progress. In future different supervised machine learning algorithms will be implemented to investigate its performance in the NIALM domain, more specifically to identify the best classifier for low sampling data granularity.
