Accurate congestion forecasting facilitates market traders in bidding and trading activities and assists market operators in system planning. This study proposes a new short-term forecasting algorithm for congestion, LMPs, and other power system variables based on the concept of system patterns—combinations of status ﬂags for gener- ating units and transmission lines. The advantage of this algorithm relative to standard statistical forecasting methods is that struc- tural aspects underlying power market operations are exploited to reduce forecast error. The advantage relative to previously pro- posed structural forecasting methods is that data requirements are substantially reduced. Forecasting results based on a NYISO case study demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed al- gorithm.

INTRODUCTION I N many transmission regions, congestion in wholesale power markets is managed by locational marginal prices (LMPs), the pricing of power in accordance with the location and timing of its injection into or withdrawal from the transmis- sion grid. Congestion and LMP forecasts are highly important for the decision-making of market participants. Accurate con- gestion and LMP forecasts give advantages to market traders in bidding and trading activities and to market operators for system planning.1 Many studies have focused on electricity price forecasting based on statistical tools [1]–[5] and structural models [6], [7], yet few studies have focused on congestion forecasting.

EPRI [9] has developed a congestion forecasting model that uses sequential Monte Carlo simulation to produce a probabilistic load ﬂow. The EPRI model provides congestion probabilities for transmission lines of interests, but it requires intensive data input to the load ﬂow model. Li and Bo [10], [11] examine LMP variation in response to load variation and they predict the next binding constraint when load is increased. However, the authors also assume that a par- ticular system growth pattern exists and that load growth at each bus is proportional to this pattern. Most U.S. wholesale power markets operating under LMP are geographically large; hence, distributed loads do not necessarily exhibit proportional growth. Moreover, the authors’ approach has not been applied in large-scale power systems where practical issues of limited data availability need to be considered. In our previous study [12], a piecewise linear-afﬁne map- ping between distributed loads and DC-OPF system variable solutions was identiﬁed and applied to forecast congestion and LMPs under the maintained assumption that complete histor- ical information was available regarding the marginality (or not) of generating units and the congestion (or not) of transmission lines. This method is able to give an exact prediction result since it is derived from the core structure of a wholesale power market. However, when applied to the actual forecasting of large-scale wholesale power systems, data requirements become a problem. The needed historical generation capacity data and line ﬂow data are either publicly unavailable on market operator websites or only available with some delay. Consequently, the correct pat- tern of binding constraints corresponding to any possible future load point is difﬁcult to effectively identify, which in turn pre- vents the accurate forecasting of system variables. Building on [12], this study develops a new algorithm for the short-term forecasting of system variables in wholesale power systems with substantially reduced data requirements. This al- gorithm permits the derivation of estimated probability distri- butions for congestion, LMPs, and other DC-OPF system vari- able solutions in real-time markets and in forward markets with hour-ahead, day-ahead, and week-ahead time horizons, condi- tional on a given commitment-and-line scenario that speciﬁes a set of generating units committed for possible dispatch and a set of transmission lines capable of supporting power ﬂow. Moreover, given suitable availability of historical data, this sce- nario-conditioned forecasting algorithm can be generalized to a cross-scenario forecasting algorithm by the assignment of prob- abilities to different commitment-and-line scenarios. This new forecasting algorithm makes use of two supporting techniques in order to substantially reduce the amount of re- quired data relative to [12]. The ﬁrst technique is a method developed by Bemporad et al. [13] and Tøndel et al. [14] for 0885-8950/$26.00 © 2011 IEEE 2186 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 4, NOVEMBER 2011 dividing the parameter space of a quadratic-linear program- ming (QLP) problem into convex subsets such that, within each convex subset, the optimal solution values can be expressed as linear-afﬁne functions of the parameters. A similar technique is applied in this study to a QLP DC-OPF problem formula- tion to show that, conditional on any given commitment-and- line scenario, the load space can be divided into convex sub- sets within which the optimal DC-OPF system variable solu- tions are linear-afﬁne functions of load. Each convex subset cor- responds to a unique system pattern, that is, a unique array of ﬂags reﬂecting a particular pattern of binding minimum or max- imum capacity constraints for the committed generating units and available transmission lines speciﬁed by the commitment- and-line scenario. The second technique concerns convex hull determination. Given any collection of points, computational geometry [15] provides algorithms to compute the corresponding convex hull, i.e., the smallest convex set containing these points. Convex hull algorithms have been gaining popularity in the areas of computer graphics, robotics, geographic information systems, and so forth. To date, however, they have not been applied in electricity market forecasting. A convex hull algorithm is used in this study to estimate the convex subsets of load space within which DC-OPF solutions are linear-afﬁne functions of load when incomplete historical data prevent their exact determination. More precisely, our new forecasting algorithm generates short-term forecasts for congestion, LMPs, and other power system variables as follows. Let denote a vector of loads at some possible future operating point corresponding to a partic- ular commitment-and-line scenario . A convex hull method is ﬁrst used to estimate the division of load space into convex subsets (system pattern regions), each corresponding to a dis- tinct historically-observed system pattern of binding capacity constraints for the particular committed generating units and available transmission lines speciﬁed under .A probabilistic point inclusion test is next used to calculate the probability that is associated with each historical system pattern, taking into account the imprecision with which the system pattern regions in load space are estimated. The congestion conditions at are then probabilistically forecasted using the probability-weighted historical system patterns and forecasts for LMPs and other system variables at are calculated using the linear-afﬁne mapping between load and DC-OPF system variable solutions that corresponds to each probability-weighted historical system pattern. Compared to state-of-the-art forecasting techniques for power markets, our new scenario-conditioned forecasting algorithm has the following two advantages: • First, our algorithm makes novel use of convex hull tech- niques to enable the short-term forecasting of congestion conditions, prices, and other system variables for large- scale wholesale power systems using only publicly avail- able data. • Second, our algorithm proposes the novel use of system patterns as an effective way to take generation and trans- mission capacity constraints into account when forecasting DC-OPF-generated system variable solutions, thus permit- ting more accurate forecasts to be obtained. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The general formulation of our forecasting problem is presented in Section II. A detailed description of our basic scenario-con- ditioned forecasting algorithm is provided in Section III. In Section IV, after some practical data-availability issues are addressed, we present a probabilistic extension of our basic scenario-conditioned forecasting algorithm that is suitable for addressing these data availability issues. In Section V, we present a NYISO case study that illustrates the effectiveness of the probabilistic scenario-conditioned forecasting algorithm developed in Section IV. In Section VI, we discuss how this algorithm can be further generalized to permit cross-scenario forecasting. Concluding remarks are provided in Section VII. II. BASIC FORECASTING PROBLEM FORMULATION In electricity markets, congestion occurs when the available economical electricity has to be delivered to load “out-of-merit- order” due to transmission limitations. That is, higher-cost gen- eration needs to be dispatched in place of cheaper generation to meet this load in order to avoid overload of transmission lines. In this case, the LMP levels at different nodes separate from each other and from the unconstrained market-clearing price. There- fore, congestion is a critical factor determining the formation of LMP levels. However, congestion patterns are difﬁcult to anticipate since they are related to the network topology of power systems. Provided perfect information is available, such as network data, load data, and generator bidding data, a market clearing model could be utilized to obtain accurate forecasts of congestion conditions and prices. Nevertheless, two issues arise for this di- rect forecasting method. First, most market traders do not have direct access to the information that is needed to implement this method; they would have to depend on data published by market operators. Second, the market operators, themselves, would need a high degree of computational speed to carry out the required computations. As a result, statistical tools have been developed that tackle these two forecasting issues by modeling the statistical corre- lation between prices and explanatory factors. These statistical tools lack explicit consideration for congestion, partly because no effective approach has been developed to enable these tools to capture and express the effects of congestion. Ignoring the effects of congestion makes the forecasted prices less reliable and difﬁcult to interpret at operating points with abnormal price behaviors. Surely it is possible to glean some useful information about future possible congestion conditions based on statistically fore- casted LMPs. However, these intuitive insights, based on fore- casters’ experiences, cannot provide reliable congestion fore- casts. From a cause-and-effect point of view, congestion is the cause while LMP is the effect. One cannot infer the cause (con- gestion) from the effect (LMP) since LMP is not solely driven by congestion. In particular, statistical LMP forecasting tools do not take into account the structural aspects of power markets that fundamentally drive the determination of LMPs: namely, the fact that LMPs are derived as solutions to optimal power ﬂow problems subject to generation capacity and transmission line constraints. ZHOU et al.: SHORT-TERM CONGESTION FORECASTING IN WHOLESALE POWER MARKETS 2187 TABLE I FLAGS USED FOR SYSTEM PATTERNS As explained more carefully in Section III, the novel concept of a “system pattern” is used in this study to incorporate the structural generation capacity and transmission line aspects that drive congestion outcomes. The forecasting of congestion at a possible future operating point is thus transformed into a problem of estimating the correct system pattern at this operating point. Moreover, the forecasting of prices and other system variables at this operating point can subsequently be undertaken using the particular linear-afﬁne mapping between load and DC-OPF system variable solutions that is associated with this system pattern. This basic forecasting approach makes three simplifying as- sumptions. First, it is assumed that the forecasting of system variables at possible future operating points can be conditioned on a particular commitment-and-line scenario, that is, a par- ticular generation commitment (designation of generating units available for dispatch) and a particular network topology (des- ignation of available transmission lines). Second, it is assumed that a lossless DC-OPF problem formulation is used for the determination of LMPs and other system variables, implying in particular that the loss components of LMPs are neglected. Third, it is assumed that generator supply-offer behaviors are relatively static in the forecasting horizons. III. BASIC FORECASTING ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION A. System Patterns and System Pattern Regions At any system operating point, the number of marginal gen- erating units and binding transmission constraints tends to be small compared to the number of nodes, transmission lines, and generating units. For example, in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) region with 36 845 network buses and 5575 generating units, the number of day-ahead binding con- straints is published daily and is typically observed to be less than 20 for an hourly interval [16]. On the other hand, high-cost units such as gas and oil units are more likely to become mar- ginal units during peak hours, the number of which is modest. Exploiting this important characteristic of power markets, the idea of a system pattern is introduced consisting of a vector of ﬂags indicating the marginal status of committed generating units and the congestion status of available transmission lines at any given system operating point; see Table I. As long as the number of marginal generating units (labeled 0) and the number of congested transmission lines (labeled or 1) are relatively few in number, the number of possible system patterns can be easily handled. As noted in Section II, the basic congestion forecasting problem can then be transformed into a problem of estimating the correct system pattern for any given possible future oper- ating point. The congestion forecast is directly obtained once the system pattern is estimated, since the status of transmission lines is part of the system pattern. Moreover, as clariﬁed below Fig. 1. Illustration of two system pattern regions (SPRs) in load space. in Section III-D, short-term forecasts for prices and other system variables at the operating point can also be obtained making use of this estimated system pattern. The proposition below provides the theoretical foundation for our proposed forecasting approach. The proposition uses the concept of a convex polytope for an -dimensional Euclidean space , i.e., a region in determined as the intersection of ﬁnitely many half-spaces in . Proposition 1: Suppose a standard DC-OPF formulation with ﬁxed loads and quadratic generator cost functions is used by a market operator to determine system variable solutions. Then, conditional on any given commitment-and-line scenario , the load space can be covered by convex polytopes such that: 1) the interior of each convex polytope corresponds to a unique system pattern and 2) within the interior of each convex polytope, the system variable solutions can be expressed as linear-afﬁne func- tions of the vector of distributed loads. The proof of Proposition 1, originally derived in [17], is outlined in an appendix to this paper. The proof starts with the derivation of inequality and equality constraints constructed from the ﬁrst-order KKT conditions for a DC-OPF problem conditional on a particular commitment-and-line scenario . The inequality constraints characterize convex polytopes that cover the load space, where the interior of each convex polytope corresponds to a unique system pattern. The convex polytopes constituting the covering of the load space are referred to as system pattern regions (SPRs) for the fact that the interior of each convex polytope is associated with a unique system pattern. Within each SPR, the equality constraints take the form of linear-afﬁne equations with constant coefﬁcients that describe ﬁxed linear-afﬁne relationships between DC-OPF system vari- able solutions and the vector of loads. The matrix of coefﬁcients for these linear-afﬁne functions gives the rates of change with regard to real-power dispatch levels for generating units and shadow prices for bus balance and line constraints when loads are perturbed within the region. This matrix is referred to below as the sensitivity matrix for this SPR. Fig. 1 provides illustrative depictions of two SPRs, and , together with their associated linear-afﬁne mappings, when the load space is composed of two-dimensional load vectors . The symbol denotes the vector of unit dispatch levels and the symbol denotes the vector of dual variables. The mappings are characterized by sensitivity matrices and ordinate vectors that are constant within each SPR, which implies that the DC-OPF solutions for and can be expressed as ﬁxed linear-afﬁne functions of the load vector within each SPR. 2188 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 4, NOVEMBER 2011 Fig. 2. Illustration of the QuickHull algorithm. B. Convex Hull Estimation of Historical SPRs In practice, deriving the exact form of the SPRs is difﬁcult due to limited access to most of the required information. This required information includes supply offer data, generating unit capacity data, and transmission limit data. This lack of information can be overcome by applying a “convex hull algorithm” to historical load data to estimate SPRs. The convex hull of a point set is the smallest convex set that contains all the points of [18]. A convex hull algorithm is a computational method for computing the convex hull of a set . As will be concretely illustrated in Section V, each historical load point corresponding to a particular commitment-and-line scenario can in principle be associated with a distinct system pattern based on corresponding historical data regarding the marginal status of the committed generating units and the con- gested status of the available transmission lines. The historical SPR corresponding to each such historically identiﬁed system pattern can then be estimated by deriving the convex hull of the collection of all historical load points that have been associated with this system pattern. This study makes use of the “QuickHull algorithm” to esti- mate historical SPRs conditional on a given commitment-and- line scenario . The QuickHull algorithm, developed by Barber et al. [19], is an iterative procedure for determining all of the points constituting the convex hull of a ﬁnite set . At each step, points in that are internal to the convex hull of , and hence not viable as vertices of the convex hull, are identiﬁed and elim- inated from further consideration. This process continues until no more such points can be found. An illustrative application of the QuickHull algorithm for a ﬁnite planar set is presented in Fig. 2. The set is ﬁrst par- titioned into two subsets and by a line lr connecting a left-most upper point to a right-most lower point , as depicted in Fig. 2(a). More precisely, the points in with the smallest x value are ﬁrst selected and from among these points, a point with a largest y value is chosen to be the left-most upper point ; sim- ilarly for the right-most lower point . For each subset and , a point in that is furthest from is determined and two additional lines are constructed, from to and from to ; see Fig. 2(b). By construction, points of that lie strictly inside the resulting triangle lzr are strictly interior to the convex hull of and hence can be eliminated from further considera- tion. The points on the triangle itself are possible vertex points for the boundary of the convex hull of . To continue the recursion, the above procedure is repeated for the reduced subset of resulting from this elimination. Fig. 3. Illustration of the basic point inclusion test for an SPR in a load plane. Speciﬁcally, two subsets and associated triangles are formed as before for and the points of lying within the inte- riors of the resulting triangles are eliminated. If a triangle ever degenerates to a line, then all the points along the line lie on the boundary of the convex hull of by construction. For example, in Fig. 2(c), the endpoints and of the line both lie on the boundary of the convex hull of . This process of elimination continues until no additional points to be eliminated can be found. Since is ﬁnite, the process is guaranteed to stop in ﬁnitely many steps. All the convex hull points for (boundary and interior) can be deter- mined recursively in this manner. The complete convex hull for is depicted in Fig. 2(d). By construction, this convex hull is a planar convex polytope. The main advantage of the QuickHull algorithm relative to other such algorithms is its ability to efﬁciently handle high-di- mensional sets by reducing computational requirements [20]. The QuickHull algorithm has been widely used in scientiﬁc ap- plications and appears to be the algorithm of choice for higher- dimensional convex hull computing [21]. C. Basic Point Inclusion Test Suppose the load space has been divided up into estimated SPRs whose interiors correspond to distinct system patterns, conditional on a given commitment-and-line scenario . Con- sider, now, the task of forecasting congestion conditions at some future operating point a short time into the future for which sce- nario again obtains. The essence of this forecasting problem is the detection of the correct SPR for this future operating point. If the correct SPR can be detected, then congested conditions can be inferred directly from the corresponding system pattern. This detection is undertaken in this study by means of a “point inclusion test”. The basic point inclusion test used in this study is illustrated in Fig. 3 for an SPR in a load plane. Recall from Section III-A that each SPR takes the form of a convex poly- tope, i.e., a region expressable as the intersection of half-spaces; hence each SPR has ﬂat faces with straight edges. Let the normal vectors pointing towards the interior of the SPR be constructed for each edge of the SPR. Now consider the depicted point and let denote the vector directed from the vertex to the point . The dot product between and each normal vector of each neighboring edge of is greater than or equal to 0. If this is true for all vertices of the SPR, the point is judged to be on or inside the SPR. On the other hand, one can see that is outside the SPR since the dot product of and the normal vector for the neighboring edge connecting to is negative. As will be seen in Section IV, practical data-availability is- sues prevent the use of the basic point inclusion test for the ZHOU et al.: SHORT-TERM CONGESTION FORECASTING IN WHOLESALE POWER MARKETS 2189 exact determination of the SPR containing any possible future load point . However, given a suitable probabilistic extension of this basic point inclusion test, the probability that any partic- ular SPR contains can be estimated. D. Linear-Afﬁne Mapping Procedure Given sufﬁcient generation and transmission information, each historical load point can be associated with an SPR ac- cording to the status of the generating units and transmission lines at the historical operating time. More precisely, given any commitment-and-line scenario , consider the collection of all historically observed load points obtaining under . Let this collection of historical load points be partitioned into subsets corresponding to distinct system patterns for scenario .For each load subset, use the QuickHull algorithm to calculate its convex hull in load space. Each of these convex hulls then constitutes a distinct estimated SPR for scenario . In principal, any future load point corresponding to scenario can then be associated with one of these estimated SPRs by means of the basic point inclusion test. This association permits the prediction of congestion, prices, and other DC-OPF system variable solutions at this load point. To see this more clearly, let and denote matrices con- sisting of all historically observed DC-OPF system solution vec- tors and load vectors corresponding to a particular system pat- tern for a particular commitment-and-line scenario . Let the SPR in load space corresponding to this system pattern, denoted by , be estimated by the convex hull of the collection of all of the historically observed load vectors included in . By Proposition 1, the mapping between and can be expressed in the linear-afﬁne form (1) where denotes the sensitivity matrix corresponding to . Normally there will be multiple historical operating points cor- responding to any one SPR for a given commitment-and-line scenario . In this case ordinary least squares (OLS) can be ap- plied to (1) to obtain estimates and for and ,as follows: (2) where . Now let denote a possible load vector for a future oper- ating time that has been found to belong to the estimated SPR , as determined from a basic point inclusion test applied to the collection of all historically estimated SPRs corresponding to scenario . Then the forecasted vector of DC-OPF system variable solutions corresponding to can be calculated as (3) The above linear-afﬁne mapping procedure is modiﬁed in Section IV to accommodate some practical issues arising from data incompleteness. IV. EXTENSION TO PROBABILISTIC FORECASTING Practical data availability issues arise for the implementation of the basic scenario-conditioned forecasting algorithm outlined Fig. 4. Given incomplete constraint information and/or incomplete historical data, convex hull estimates for SPRs can be biased. in Section III. This section discusses how these issues can be addressed by means of a probabilistic extension of this basic algorithm. Throughout this discussion, the analysis is assumed to be conditioned on a given commitment-and-line scenario . A. Practical Data Availability Issues The basic scenario-conditioned forecasting algorithm pro- posed in Section III assumes that historical data are available regarding binding constraints for all generating units and for transmission lines on an hourly basis. In actuality, however, the marginal status of generating units is either conﬁdential or published with limitations. Moreover, the theoretical load space cannot be fully reﬂected by the hourly historical load data which represent several realizations and subsets of the complete load space. Due to these data limitations, in practice, the set indexing hourly binding constraints cannot be completely determined. Consequently, estimates obtained for the SPRs could be biased. The two basic ways in which this bias could arise are illus- trated in Fig. 4 for a simple two-dimensional load space. Sup- pose the SPR corresponding to the true binding constraint set is given by (area 1) in Fig. 4. This true SPR can in principle be determined by applying the basic point inclusion test to every possible future operating point. Suppose, however, that the practically estimated binding constraint set is incomplete; for example, suppose only reﬂects the status of the most frequently congested lines. Given complete historical load data, the estimated convex hull (area 3) would then have to be larger than the true (area 1) because is smaller (less restrictive) than the true .In fact, however, the actual estimated convex hull must be based on available historical load data. Since the latter is only a subset of the full load space, the result will be an actual estimated convex hull (area 2) that lies within (area 3). In short, incom- pleteness of and incompleteness of the practical load space each separately introduce bias in the estimate for , but in op- posing directions. What are the practical implications of this bias for our basic forecasting algorithm? Two possible cases need to be handled, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Case A: Point in Fig. 5 lies in the interior of two different estimated , namely, and corresponding to two distinct system patterns and . The true SPRs cor- responding to and are denoted by the shaded regions and , respectively. The fact that the interiors of 2190 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 4, NOVEMBER 2011 Fig. 5. Two possible types of forecast error due to biased SPR estimates. the true SPRs do not overlap follows from Proposition 1 established in Section III-A. However, as explained above, overlap can occur for the interiors of estimated SPRs due to bias. Case B: Point in Fig. 5 is actually in the true SPR . However, point cannot be assigned to either of the esti- mated SPRs because the bias in these estimates has caused point to lie outside of both of them. B. Probabilistic Point Inclusion Test To mitigate the issues arising from the two types of bias discussed in Section III-A, mean and interval forecasting can be performed for the DC-OPF system variable solutions corresponding to any forecasted future load point . This probabilistic forecasting can be implemented by estimating the probability of each SPR conditional on , which can be characterized as a probabilistic point inclusion test. More precisely, let denote the forecasted load at a future operating point and let denote any particular SPR . Let the collection of all historically identiﬁed SPRs be denoted by and let denote the cardinality of . Suppose the prob- ability of occurrence for any SPR not in is zero. Then the probability that has occurred, given that has been ob- served, can be expressed as (4) In practice, the various terms in (4) have to be estimated. In this study, it will be assumed that the prior probability is an empirical prior estimated by the historical frequency of : namely, the number of times in the past that has been observed to occur divided by the total number of all past SPR observations. The term in (4) represents the probability of ob- serving the load point given that the true SPR is . Intu- itively, this probability should be a decreasing function of the distance between and . Therefore, this probability is esti- mated in this study as follows: (5) In (5), the term denotes the (Euclidean) distance between and and denotes the total distance calculated as the sum of the distances between and each SPR in . The normal- ization parameter in (5) can be adjusted to obtain an appro- priate conditional probability measure, possibly by using his- torical data as training cases. A speciﬁcation results in a uniform conditional probability (5) for : namely, 1 divided by the cardinality of . In this case, (5) is independent of the distance measures . Alternatively, a speciﬁcation implies the conditional probability (5) is derived from a linear normalization, while corresponds to a quadratic normal- ization. As will be shown below, the quadratic normalization form of the conditional probability (5) results in good forecasts for our NYISO case study. Mean forecasts for the DC-OPF system variable solutions at the operating point with forecasted load point can then be obtained using the estimated form for the conditional proba- bility assessments (4), denoted by for short. Let denote the forecasted DC-OPF system variable solution vector corre- sponding to any historical SPR in . The mean forecast can then be calculated as (6) A forecaster might also be interested in calculating upper and lower bounds for the DC-OPF system variable solutions calcu- lated with respect to the most likely SPRs. Let denote the forecaster’s desired cut-off number of most probable SPRs and let represent the subset of that contains these most probable SPRs. Then the upper bound and lower bound for each forecasted DC-OPF system variable solution can be determined over the set of SPRs in . As a measure of dis- persion, the forecaster can further consider the coverage proba- bility CP, deﬁned to be the summation of the probability assess- ments (4) for the most probable SPRs. Finally, another alternative might be for the forecaster to con- sider mean forecasts calculated using the most probable SPRs, i.e., the subset of . For example, a forecaster could choose , which would result in a point fore- cast for the DC-OPF system variable solutions based on a single most likely SPR in as determined from the estimated form of the conditional probability assessments (4). C. Probabilistic Forecasting Algorithm Taking into account the practical data issues addressed in Sections IV-A and B, our proposed probabilistic forecasting al- gorithm proceeds in four steps, as follows: Step 1) Perform historical data processing to identify histor- ical system patterns. Use the QuickHull algorithm to estimate historical SPRs as convex hulls of histori- cally observed load points corresponding to distinct historical system patterns. Step 2) For each historical SPR estimated in Step 1, a linear-afﬁne mapping between load vectors and DC-OPF system variable solution vectors is derived using historical load and system variable data. The system variable solution vectors include real-power dispatch levels and dual variables for nodal balance and transmission line constraints. The linear-afﬁne mapping is characterized by a sensitivity matrix and an ordinate vector. ZHOU et al.: SHORT-TERM CONGESTION FORECASTING IN WHOLESALE POWER MARKETS 2191 Step 3) For any possible load point in the near future for which system variable forecasts are desired, a prob- abilistic point inclusion test is performed. More pre- cisely, the estimated form of the conditional proba- bility distribution (4) is used to estimate the proba- bility that lies in each of the historical SPRs iden- tiﬁed in Step 1. Step 4) The results from Steps 1–3 are used to generate probabilistic forecasts at the future possible oper- ating point for generation capacity and transmis- sion congestion conditions (system patterns) as well as for DC-OPF system variable solutions for dis- patch levels and dual variables (including LMPs). For example, these probabilistic forecasts could take the form of mean and interval forecasts, or they could be point forecasts based on a most probable SPR. V. NYISO CASE STUDY A. Case Study Overview A case study using NYISO 2007 data is reported in this sec- tion for the probabilistic scenario-conditioned forecasting algo- rithm presented in Section IV-C. NYISO has a footprint cov- ering 11 load zones [22]. Short-term zonal load forecasting data and binding constraints data are available at the NYISO web- site [23]. This forecasting algorithm is applicable for power markets using either nodal or zonal LMP pricing, since Proposition 1 in Section III-A does not rule out either form of pricing. However, NYISO’s website [23] only posts daily zonal load data for its 11 load zones, which makes it impossible to forecast prices down to each node. In addition, historical NYISO price data reveal the similarity of LMPs within some of these 11 load zones, hence the negligibility of inter-zonal congestion between these zones. For this reason, to reduce our computational burden without any signiﬁcant loss of information, we chose to reduce the original 11 load zones for the NYISO to 8 load zones by combining Zone Millwood with Dunwoodie and Zone West and Genesee with Central. The top 25 most frequently congested high-voltage trans- mission lines during 2007 for the NYSIO day-ahead market are studied in [24]. The focus of our case study is on the ﬁve most frequently congested high-voltage transmission lines during 2007, speciﬁcally, DUNWODIE 345 SHORE RD 345 1 (D-S), CENTRAL EAST-VC (C-V), PLSNTVLY 345 LEEDS 345 1 (P-L), WEST CENTRAL (W-C), and SPRNBRK 345 EGRDNCTR 345 1 (S-E). Since the marginal status of gener- ating units is not available from the NYISO, the conditioning scenario for this empirical study is taken to be the availability of these ﬁve lines. System patterns are thus equivalent to congestion patterns for these ﬁve lines. Regarding time period, we selected 12 test days consisting of the last day of each month in 2007. The 24 operating hours starting from 0:00 for each test day were treated as future op- erating points. Forecasted load data at these hours were used to identify system patterns and to generate system variable fore- casts. These forecasted results were then compared with actual realizations to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. Due TABLE II FOUR MOST FREQUENT HISTORICAL CONGESTION PATTERNS FOR 01/31/2007 to space limitations, graphical illustrations are presented only for January 31 and February 28; numerical results for the last days of other months are given in tables. All calculations for this case study were implemented using Matlab 7.8 on an Intel Core 2 PC with 3.0-GHz CPU. The com- putational time for each daily forecast was about 2 min. B. Implementation of Probabilistic Forecasting Historical price and load data were ﬁrst processed to iden- tify historical system patterns and SPRs, which is Step 1 of our probabilistic forecasting algorithm. Sorted by congestion patterns, about 19 to 30 historical system patterns (hence SPRs) were found for each forecasted day. For example, the four most frequently observed congestion patterns for January 31 are shown in Table II. System patterns for other days are categorized similarly. Step 2 of our algorithm was then carried out. Speciﬁcally, the sensitivity matrix and ordinate vector for each historical SPR were estimated by ordinary least squares, making use of the ac- tual system operating points observed for each historical system pattern. In Step 3, forecasted load data for the 24 operating hours of each test day were then treated as possible future load points. For each of the latter points, the probabilistic point inclusion test detailed in Section IV-B was used to assign estimated con- ditional probability assessments (4) giving the probability that this future load point was contained within each historical SPR. In these Step 3 calculations, we ﬁrst evaluated the forecasting performance of three values (0, 1, and 2) for the normalization parameter in (5) on the basis of historical data. The speciﬁ- cation gave the best forecast results for most historical days; hence, this value was chosen to forecast system variables for the future load points. Finally, in Step 4, the results of Steps 1–3 above were used to generate probabilistic forecasts in the form of mean and in- terval forecasts. For the mean forecasts, was set equal to the cardinality of . For the interval forecasts, was set equal to 4. For the interval forecasts, the size of (i.e., the cut-off number of most probable SPRs) depends on the forecaster’s de- sired trade-off between accuracy and precision. A larger tends to increase forecasting accuracy, in the sense that there is a better chance the correct SPR will be among the consid- ered SPRs. On the other hand, the precision of any resulting mean forecast is correspondingly reduced (i.e., the variance of the forecasts across the considered SPRs is increased). In the current study, the speciﬁcation is used for interval forecasts because it results in good precision without signiﬁcant loss of coverage probability. 2192 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 4, NOVEMBER 2011 TABLE III FORECASTED CONGESTION PATTERNS VERSUS THE ACTUAL CONGESTION PATTERN ON 01/31/2007 C. Congestion Pattern Forecasts Table III reports the four most probable hourly congestion patterns, along with their associated estimated conditional prob- abilities and coverage probability (based on ), for every ﬁfth hour of January 31, 2007, starting from hour 0:00. Actual congestion patterns corresponding to each reported hour are highlighted in gray. As seen, for the reported hours, the actual congestion pattern is always included among the fore- casted congestion patterns and has the highest estimated condi- tional probability. For future reference, note also that the ﬁrst entry of the actual congestion pattern, corresponding to trans- mission line D-S, is always 1. This indicates that D-S is fre- quently congested. The multiple forecasted congestion patterns associated with each reported hour in Table III represent several credible con- gestion scenarios that could occur in the future. If a forecaster desires to derive one forecast for the future congestion pattern, an intuitively reasonable option would be to select a forecasted congestion pattern that has the highest associated conditional probability (4). As observed in Table III, for the case study at hand, this approach would result in the correct prediction of the actual congestion pattern for each reported hour. In general, however, more reliable forecasts for system conditions and DC-OPF system variable solutions would be obtained by making fuller use of the conditional probability assessments (4) to form mean forecasts and interval forecasts. D. Mean Forecasts for LMPs One of the beneﬁts of congestion forecasting is to enable the more precise prediction of LMPs for market operators and traders in their short-term decision making. Forecasted and ac- tual LMPs for Zone Central on January 31 and February 28 are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Root mean squared error (RMSE) and Fig. 6. Actual versus mean LMP forecasts for Zone Central on 01/31/2007. Fig. 7. Actual versus mean LMP forecasts for Zone Central on 02/28/2007. mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) [5] are used as mea- sures of forecast accuracy: (7) (8) Table IV reports the RMSE and MAPE obtained using our probabilistic forecasting algorithm for each of our 12 test days. Corresponding forecast results obtained using a well-known statistical model—the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model [4]—are also shown for comparison. As seen, except for the slightly smaller MAPE value attained in February using GARCH, our forecasting al- gorithm outperforms GARCH in the sense that smaller RMSE and MAPE values are obtained. E. Interval Forecasts for Line Shadow Prices and LMPs Interval forecasting is recommended over mean forecasting for line shadow prices. As clariﬁed below, interval forecasting is more informative than mean forecasting for line shadow prices because the underlying attribute of interest (negative-direction, zero, or positive-direction congestion) is measured by a dis- cretely-valued indicator (-1, 0, or 1). Hourly upper-bound and lower-bound interval forecasts for the line shadow prices on line D-S on January 31 and February ZHOU et al.: SHORT-TERM CONGESTION FORECASTING IN WHOLESALE POWER MARKETS 2193 TABLE IV RMSE AND MAPE VALUES FOR THE 12 TEST DAYS Fig. 8. Actual versus interval D-S line shadow price forecasts on 01/31/2007. Fig. 9. Actual versus interval D-S line shadow price forecasts on 02/28/2007. 28 are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 along with actual line shadow prices for comparison. As seen, the actual line shadow prices for most hours fall within the forecasted intervals. To better interpret these ﬁndings, consider the Table III results which forecast that line D-S (the ﬁrst congestion pattern entry) Fig. 10. Actual versus interval LMP forecasts for Zone Central on 01/31/2007. Fig. 11. Actual versus interval LMP forecasts for Zone Central on 02/28/2007. will be either congested or not during hour 20 with varying prob- abilities. If congestion is forecasted, it is in the positive direction and from Fig. 8, the line shadow price is estimated to be about $60/MWh. On the other hand, if no congestion is fore- casted (0), then from Fig. 8, the line shadow price is estimated to be $0/MWh. One ﬁnal point for interval forecasts for line shadow prices is important to note. For lines for which no congestion occurs in any of the reported congestion patterns (e.g., line S-E in Table III), the corresponding upper and lower bounds for the forecasted line shadow price interval will both be zero, indicating zero congestion. Interval forecasts for Zone Central LMPs on January 31 and February 28 are shown in Figs. 10 and 11 along with actual LMP values for comparison. For most hours, the actual LMP values fall within the upper and lower bounds of the forecasted intervals. The interval forecasting performance for line shadow prices and zonal LMPs is measured using the accuracy-informative- ness tradeoff model developed in [25]. The statistical loss func- tion LOSS is deﬁned to be (9) In (9), denotes the actual value, denotes the midpoint of the forecasted interval, and denotes the natural logarithm of the width of the forecasted interval. Also, determines the tradeoff between accuracy (the ﬁrst term) and informative- ness (the second term); in this case study, is set to 1. Note 2194 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 4, NOVEMBER 2011 TABLE V LOSS FUNCTION VALUES AS A MEASURE OF INTERVAL FORECASTING PERFORMANCE FOR THE 12 TEST DAYS that a smaller LOSS indicates better performance for interval forecasting. Table V gives the LOSS values for the interval forecasts ob- tained for line shadow price and zonal LMPs using our proba- bilistic forecasting algorithm versus the forecasts obtained using a statistical GARCH model. As seen, our probabilistic fore- casting algorithm results in uniformly lower LOSS values than GARCH, indicating a better forecasting performance. A possible explanation for this performance difference is that GARCH has difﬁculty handling the volatility of line shadow prices, which can abruptly change from 0 to large nonzero values. In contrast, our probabilistic forecasting algorithm captures the physical meaning of these line shadow prices and this facilitates better forecasting. In this study we observed that, in some months (January, May, November, and December), the peak-hour LMPs and line shadow prices were difﬁcult to forecast with precision. This phe- nomenon could possibly be due to changes in the generating unit commitment pattern or in the transmission network topology over the forecast horizon. To enhance peak-hour forecasting re- sults, more careful collection of historical data might be needed to ensure that these historical data correspond to the same com- mitment-and-line scenario as the forecasted point. Alternatively, as discussed in the following Section VI, an extended cross-sce- nario forecast study could be attempted. VI. EXTENSION TO CROSS-SCENARIO FORECASTING To this point, the forecasting algorithm developed in this study has been conditioned on a given commitment-and-line scenario specifying a particular generating unit commitment pattern and a particular transmission network topology. One interpretation of is that it represents anticipated conditions at a future operating point for which forecasts are desired. Another interpretation of is that it represents a possible future system contingency (e.g., an N-1 outage scenario) under consideration in a contingency planning study. Fig. 12. Scenario-conditioned and cross-scenario forecasting. A possibly useful extension of this algorithm would be to as- sign probabilities to distinct scenarios, thus permitting the prob- abilistic cross-scenario blending of forecasts. These scenarios could be characterized not only on the basis of system pat- terns, i.e., generating unit commitments and transmission net- work topology, but also on the basis of a variety of other types of contingencies. As illustrated in Fig. 12, for any future operating point whose system conditions need to be forecasted, the corresponding gen- erating unit commitment, transmission network topology, and other contingencies could be projected with some probabilities. In each of these projected scenarios, our scenario-conditioned forecasting algorithm could be applied to estimate congestion, LMPs, and other system variables. The ﬁnal forecast for any system variable of interest could then be the expected value of this system variable calculated across all projected scenarios. VII. CONCLUSION Short-term congestion forecasting is critical for both market traders and market operators. Congestion forecasting helps to explain electricity price behaviors and facilitates the decision- making of power system participants. This study ﬁrst proposes a basic scenario-conditioned fore- casting algorithm that permits the short-term forecasting of con- gestion, prices, and other power system variables conditional on a given generating unit commitment pattern and transmission network topology. This basic algorithm uses the novel concept of a “system pattern” to permit structural capacity constraints on generation and transmission to be properly accounted for in the forecasting procedure. To handle practical data-availability concerns, a probabilistic extension of this basic algorithm is then proposed that can be implemented purely on the basis of publicly available infor- mation. The accuracy of this probabilistic algorithm relative to a more traditional GARCH statistical forecasting model is demonstrated for a NYISO case study. Finally, a cross-scenario extension of this forecasting algo- rithm is proposed in which probabilities are assigned to different scenarios. This would permit forecasters to probabilistically av- erage forecasts across distinct scenarios, thus potentially per- mitting longer forecast horizons and/or increased availability of pertinent historical data. ZHOU et al.: SHORT-TERM CONGESTION FORECASTING IN WHOLESALE POWER MARKETS 2195 The proposed algorithm is targeted for energy-only markets; future work will consider the incorporation of ancillary ser- vices. Future work will also explore additional factors, such as possible strategic supply offer behaviors by generators. More- over, alternative forms for the probabilistic point inclusion test, a key building block of our algorithm, will be systematically studied. APPENDIX Consider a wholesale power market operating over a trans- mission grid with buses. Assume for simplicity that each bus has one ﬁxed load denoted by and one generator with a real power level denoted by . Suppose, also, that each generator has a quadratic total cost function with coefﬁcients and . Finally, suppose the objective of the market operator in each hour is to minimize the total system cost of meeting ﬁxed load subject to an injection-equals-load balance constraint, transmission line ﬂow limits, and generator operating capacity limits. In particular, suppose the market operator attempts to achieve its objective in each hour by using the following stan- dard DC-OPF formulation that assumes a lossless transmission system: (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) In these equations, denotes the generation shift factor (GSF) that measures the impact of 1-MW injection by gener- ator on transmission line . Equality (11) represents the system balance constraint ensuring total generation matches total load. The transmission line ﬂow limit constraints in two directions are expressed in (12) and (13). The last two inequalities (14) and (15) express each generator’s upper and lower operating ca- pacity limits. Proposition 1: Consider the standard DC-OPF formula- tion with ﬁxed loads and quadratic generator cost functions de- scribed in (10)–(15). Suppose this standard formulation is used by a market operator to determine system variable solutions. Then, conditional on any given commitment-and-line scenario S, the load space can be covered by convex polytopes such that: 1) the interior of each convex polytope corresponds to a unique system pattern and 2) within the interior of each convex poly- tope, the system variable solutions can be expressed as linear- afﬁne functions of the vector of distributed loads. Proof Outline [17]: First note that the DC-OPF formu- lation can equivalently be expressed in the following compact form: (16) (17) (18) The notation in this general QP problem is described in [17]. The KKT ﬁrst-order necessary conditions for (16)–(18) can then be expressed as follows: (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) Let denote the set of indices corresponding to the active (binding) equality and inequality constraints for the DC-OPF problem. If the number of binding unit capacity constraints and line limit constraints are denoted by and , respectively, then Cardinality . Let , , and repre- sent the matrices corresponding to . Then, , , and have row dimension and column dimension . Let denote the multiplier vector corresponding to .Given , (19)–(21) reduce to (24) (25) Tøndel [14] deﬁnes the linear independence constraint qual- iﬁcation (LICQ) for an active set of constraints to be the as- sumption that these constraints are linearly independent. For the problem at hand, LICQ holds if has full row rank. A gen- erator that is at its upper capacity limit cannot at the same time be at its lower limit; hence, and never co-exist. Moreover, the GSF matrix included in has linearly independent rows. Thus, .It follows that has full row rank if (26) The regularity condition (26) requires that the number of binding constraints does not exceed the number of decision variables , a necessary condition for the existence of the DC-OPF problem solutions assumed to exist in Proposition 1. Consequently, (26) automatically holds under the assump- tions of Proposition 1. Given the LICQ (26) and the diagonal form of the matrix , is invertible. Equations (24) and (25) can then be used to derive explicit solutions for and as shown in (27) and (28). Note that these solutions are linear-afﬁne functions of 2196 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 4, NOVEMBER 2011 the load vector . See equations (27)–(30) at the bottom of the page. In summary, given a particular load vector , explicit solu- tions have been derived for and as linear-afﬁne functions of . However, by construction, as long as the set of active con- straints remains unchanged in a neighborhood of the load vector in the load space , the linear-afﬁne form of these solutions re- mains optimal. Such a neighborhood is given by the feasible re- gion determined from (22) and (23). Substituting and from (27) and (28) into (22) and (23), one obtains inequalities (29) and (30). The load vectors satisfying the latter inequalities are the intersection of a ﬁnite number of half-spaces in the load space and hence they form a convex polytope in this load space.
