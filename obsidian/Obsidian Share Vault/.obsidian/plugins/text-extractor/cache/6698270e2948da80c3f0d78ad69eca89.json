Around two-thirds of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tCO2eq/cap. The average per capita carbon footprint of North America and Europe amount to 13.4 and 7.5 tCO2eq/cap, respectively, while that of Africa and the Middle East—to 1.7 tCO2eq/cap on average. Changes in consumption patterns to low-carbon alternatives therefore present a great and urgently required potential for emission reductions. In this paper, we synthesize emission mitigation potentials across the consumption domains of food, housing, transport and other consumption. Methods. We systematically screened 6990 records in the Web of Science Core Collections and Scopus. Searches were restricted to (1) reviews of lifecycle assessment studies and (2) multiregional input-output studies of household consumption, published after 2011 in English. We selected against pre-determined eligibility criteria and quantitatively synthesized findings from 53 studies in a meta-review. We identified 771 original options, which we summarized and presented in 61 consumption options with a positive mitigation potential. We used a fixed-effects model to explore the role of contextual factors (geographical, technical and socio-demographic factors) for the outcome variable (mitigation potential per capita) within consumption options. Results and discussion. We establish consumption options with a high mitigation potential measured in tons of CO2eq/capita/yr. For transport, the options with the highest mitigation potential include living car-free, shifting to a battery electric vehicle, and reducing flying by a long return flight with a median reduction potential of more than 1.7 tCO2eq/cap. In the context of food, the highest carbon savings come from dietary changes, particularly an adoption of vegan diet with an average and median mitigation potential of 0.9 and 0.8 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. Shifting to renewable electricity and refurbishment and renovation are the options with the highest mitigation potential in the housing domain, with medians at 1.6 and 0.9 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. We find that the top ten consumption options together yield an average mitigation potential of 9.2 tCO2eq/cap, indicating substantial contributions towards achieving the 1.5 ◦C–2 ◦C target, particularly in high-income context. 1. Background 1.1. The need for demand reductions Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon footprints) have been steadily rising, with faster, siz- able and immediate CO2 emissions declines needed to limit cumulative emissions and reach net zero emissions in 2050 [1]. Annual GHG emissions must decrease by 45% percent of their 2010-levels by 2030, and reach net-zero by 2050 to limit temperature changes to 1.5 ◦C above preindustrial levels. The potential impacts and risks are substantially lower © 2020 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd Environ. Res. Lett. 15 (2020) 093001 D Ivanova et al for a 1.5 ◦C global warming compared with a 2 ◦C, including climate-related risks and threats regarding various ecosystems and human welfare [1]. Global GHG emissions amounted to 6.3 tCO2eq/cap in 2011 [2]; however, these are highly unequally dis- tributed across income groups and countries [3–8]. For example, the average per capita carbon footprint of North America and Europe amount to 13.4 and 7.5 tCO2eq/cap, respectively, while that of Africa and the Middle East—to 1.7 tCO2eq/cap on average (SM figure 1). For a population of 8.5 billion by 2030 [9], emissions need to decrease to an average of ~2.8 tCO2eq/cap by 2030, to comply with a pathway of limiting climate change to 1.5 ◦C of global warming. This is broadly in line with other estimates of per cap- ita carbon budgets [10–12]. The exact carbon budget for limiting global warming to 1.5 ◦C is influenced by uncertainty about earth system dynamics, as well as the scale and speed of adoption of negative emission technologies. Almost all of the IPCC scenarios currently assume large-scale adoption of negative emission technolo- gies at massive scales [14–16], which are potentially associated with strong adverse economic and envir- onmental consequences [17], energy constraints (e.g. expanding carbon) [18] and moral hazards because they tempt policy makers to delay mitigation action now [16]. Energy end-use is the least efficient part of the global energy system with the largest improve- ment potential, where appropriate scaling down of the global energy demand allows for feasible de- carbonization without betting on controversial neg- ative emission technologies or geoengineering. While technological solutions that decarbonize energy supply or capture carbon have to make a significant mitigation contribution, changing consumption offers more flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector and limit the related supply-side risks [19]. Mitigation scenarios relying more heavily on reduction in the demand of energy services are clearly associated with the lowest mitiga- tion and adaptation challenges [16, 20] and provide a range of co-benefits. 1.2. Challenging consumption Behavior, everyday life and cultural norms around consumption have a crucial influence on energy use and embodied emissions, with a high mitiga- tion potential in various consumption domains [19, 21, 22]. 65% of global GHG emissions, and 50%– 80% of land, water and material use, can be directly and indirectly linked to household consumption [3]. Income is a major driver of household carbon foot- prints [5, 7, 8, 23, 24], directly affecting purchas- ing power of households. Changes in household con- sumption patterns to low-carbon alternatives, such as transport model shifts, home energy reduction and dietary shifts, thus present a great mitigation potential. Importantly, in the last decade, so-called multire- gional input-output models (MRIO) have enabled the systematic analysis of global production and con- sumption using consistent accounts of global GHG emissions, and taking into account the scale and com- plexity of international trade and supply chains [25– 27]. Consumption estimates derived through MRIOs were the first to fully allocate global emissions to national household consumption (as well as gov- ernment activities and investments) without double- counting or omitting emissions, thus overcoming a long-standing limitation of single-regional input- output approaches and lifecycle assessment (LCA) studies [28, 29]. However, understanding options for change also requires bottom-up detailed information and insights going down to the product-level—which is a challenge for MRIOs as they offer a quite limited product detail. In this context, LCAs are relevant due to their process-specific and highly detailed nature. Here we argue that a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches provides a robust base for the review of the mitigation potentials of consumption options. In this paper, we systematically review the liter- ature on mitigation potentials across various con- sumption domains, including food, housing, and transport, focusing on academic publications since 2011 to ensure relevance of derived estimates. While prior studies address some of these concerns (for a non-comprehensive list of studies see [11, 17, 30– 32]), we conduct meta-review including the more recent evidence. Therefore, we provide a richer and more updated evidence base to inform about mitiga- tion potentials of changes in consumption practices, policies and infrastructure. For the purpose of this paper, we do not cap- ture mitigation potential associated with other aven- ues towards social change [22], such as community action and engagement [33, 34], policies and incent- ives, political engagement and non-violent civil dis- obedience [35] or reductions in overall working time and re-definitions of paid labour [24], which all are highly relevant for challenging societal norms around consumption and tackling climate change. Supply chain actors play a key role for climate change mitiga- tion, having direct agency over the majority of energy and emissions along supply chains [36, 37]. Simil- arly, structural change by governments, ending fossil- fuel support, and providing low-carbon infrastruc- tures, is crucial to enable climate change mitigation [38–40]. We also do not review system-wide effects and potential for income rebound effects [41–43]. Our focus on consumption options should not be interpreted as passing the mitigation responsibility to consumers [44]. Still, a change in consumption prac- tices is needed for reaching net-zero carbon emissions [1, 45]. 2 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 (2020) 093001 D Ivanova et al 1.3. Research questions Primary question: What is the mitigation potential of household-level consumption options within mobility, housing and food sectors, when considering GHG emis- sions along the whole lifecycle? The primary question consists of the following question components: Population (P): Household consumption of food, mobility and housing Intervention (I): Consumption options within each end-use sector Comparator (C): Average per capita carbon footprints of food, mobility and housing Outcome (O): Annual carbon savings measured in per capita CO2-equivalent reductions Study types: LCA review studies with quantitative synthesis of data, MRIO studies of household con- sumption, consumption scenario studies We focus on household consumption associ- ated with the three end-use sectors of food, trans- port and housing as they are highly relevant in terms of consumption-based GHG emissions [3, 46], energy [47] and other resource use [3] with some of the highest potential for consumption intervention [30, 48]. Secondary question: What factors may explain dif- ferences in carbon savings associated with each con- sumption option across studies and contexts? We aimed to capture sources of heterogen- eity across studies, including system boundary [49], methodological specificities, socio-economic, urban- rural and geographical context among others. 2. Methods and search results The review followed the Collaboration for Environ- mental Evidence Guidelines [50] and it conformed to ROSES reporting standards [51]. It was conduc- ted according to peer-reviewed protocol [52] that was submitted to Environmental Research Letters in March 2019 and approved in April 2019. The approved protocol is openly available online [52]. 2.1. Deviations from the protocol (outline) The following changes were made from the final pub- lished protocol [52]: first, we applied machine learn- ing in the article screening process; second, we dis- cussed the variation among studies in a qualitative manner in text rather than using the CEESAT tool for critical assessment (which was not suitable to assess non-review studies). 2.2. Searches for literature Searches were performed on Web of Science Core Collections (WoSCC) and Scopus to identify relevant peer-reviewed studies published after 2011, using the University of Leeds subscription. The searches were done on titles, keywords and abstracts in English. The search string was composed of three sub- strings: the GHG emission (X), study type (review) (Y) and consumption domain (Z) sub-string (table 1). The sub-strings were connected with the Boolean oper- ator ‘AND’ as follows: X AND Y AND Z. We based the GHG emission sub-string (X) on prior similar searches [53, 54]. The consumption domain sub-string (Z) captured the consumption domains of trans- port, food, housing and other consumption (gen- eral), and specific consumption options (interven- tions) within these domains. The sub-strings in each domain-specific cell were connected with Boolean operator ‘OR’ to form the consumption domain sub- string (Z). To test comprehensiveness of the search, we used a list of benchmark papers (see the protocol for details). A search on WoSCC (conducted on 24 May 2019) yielded 5638 records and on Scopus addi- tional 1352 records (see the supplementary materi- als for search queries), totaling 6990 records. The res- ults of both searches were combined into a ‘Scoping Review Helper’ library where exact duplicates were removed. Figure 1 provides more detailed overview of the search and screening process of the review. 2.3. Article screening and eligibility criteria Article screening was done first at the title and abstract level, and then on full text level (figure 1). The title and abstract screening was supported by machine learning. Table 2 provides an overview the eligibility criteria according to the PICO frame- work (see the supplementary information for more details). Having reviewed the first 991 records (15% of unique records) drawn randomly from the total num- ber of records, we started an iterative process where at each iteration, we (1) trained a machine learning model with the already screened documents; (2) fit- ted this model on the unseen documents; and (3) assigned the next set of documents for review by selecting the documents predicted to be most rel- evant. We went through four iterations of machine learning prioritized screening, (see figure 2(a) and each had decreasing proportions of relevant docu- ments in the set of reviewed records. The first iter- ation of 250 documents contained 38% of relevant records, while the last iteration of 100 documents— only 3% relevant documents. We screened a final ran- dom sample of 100 documents, and used this sample to generate an estimate of the number of relevant doc- uments remaining using the Agresti-Coull confidence interval. Figure 2(b) shows the minimum recall at dif- ferent levels of uncertainty. After titles and abstract screening, we considered 228 relevant records at full-text (figure 1). In addi- tion, nine pre-screened articles were added separately, which were considered relevant but were not found through the original search. Six of these additions were not published at the time of the original search. 3 Environ. Res.

See the supplementary data extraction for more detail about excluded articles and the supplemenary materials (https://stacks.iop.org/ERL/15/ 093001/mmedia) for details on the methods. We applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria (table 2) and a final set of 53 articles were considered eli- gible at full text. See the supplementary materials and extraction sheet for more details on the procedure. We used software for evidence synthesis ‘Scoping Review Helper’ (developed by MCC Berlin), for man- aging search results, removing duplicates, screening records, extracting data and conducting synthesis. We also designed search queries through managing top- ics iteratively, and refined the inclusion criteria dur- ing the screening process. 2.4. Data extraction and synthesis We extracted meta-data from each reviewed study, including title, author team, year of publication and data collection, consumption option and domain, geographical context, method, system boundary, car- bon metric and GHGs included from the eligible studies. We further extracted the study quantitat- ive findings, e.g. average, standard deviation, num- ber of studies reviewed, min-max range, absolute and relative carbon savings, contextual carbon foot- print calculations. Missing or unclear information was requested directly from authors. We recal- culated the mitigation potential of consumption options in tons CO2 equivalents per capita where needed in order to improve comparability across studies. The baselines considered in the reviewed studies are associated with large uncertainties and different assumptions (e.g. average baseline vs high-carbon baseline). At the same time, the baselines are key for the calculation of mitigation potentials and may largely affect the order of consumption options on the graph. In such cases results should be interpreted with caution. 4 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 (2020) 093001 D Ivanova et al 2.5. Data synthesis and potential effect modifiers/reasons for heterogeneity Included literature is characterized by a large vari- ation in methods, internal validity of studies, cover- age of different GHGs, location and timeframe, sys- tem boundary, assumptions about uptake rate [57] and other potential sources of heterogeneity. We dis- cussed heterogeneity along with the narrative syn- thesis of study findings. Where data allowed, we con- sidered the effect modifiers in quantitative synthesis. We used a fixed-effects model to explore the relation- ship between predictors (various geographical, tech- nical and socio-demographic factors) and outcome variables (mitigation potential per capita) across consumption options as a way to explain the vari- ation in mitigation potential. Using the fixed-effect approach, we control for factors invariant across mit- igation options, which we could not include directly in our model. 3. Review results Figures 3–6 depict the mitigation potential ranges of various consumption options in the domains of food, transport, housing and other consumption. Positive values are associated with positive mitigation poten- tial, with the options ordered by medians. 3.1. Transport The highest mitigation potential of reviewed options is found in the domain of transport (figure 3), which is also associated with a substantial carbon footprint in most world regions (SM figure 1). The consump- tion options with the highest mitigation potential advocate reduction in car and air travel, as well as a shift toward less carbon intensive fuel sources, means and modes of transportation. There is substantial mitigation potential in redu- cing air travel for those who fly. One less flight (long return) may reduce between 4.5 and 0.7 (mean of 1.9) tCO2eq/cap, while taking One less flight (medium return)—between 1.5 and 0.2 (0.6) tCO2eq/cap. The two options have a median reduction potential of 1.7 and 0.6 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. Yet, the number of trips per passenger in 2018 amounted to 2.0 in the United States and to 3.6 and 4.8 in wealthy European countries such as Luxembourg and Norway, with the numbers projected to increase rapidly [64]. Other studies exploring partial reductions in air travel (Less transport by air) find an average reduction potential of 0.8 tCO2eq/cap. The overall mitigation potentials strongly depend on income, as high-income house- holds fly much more [4, 5, 65]. Reducing car travel is associated with substantial mitigation potential. Living car-free has the highest median mitigation potential across all of the reviewed options at 2.0 tCO2eq/cap, with a range between 3.6 and 0.6 tCO2eq/cap. Assumptions around vehicle and fuel characteristics as well as travel distance are key for the estimated mitigation potential, with the maximum value in our sample being associated with giving up an SUV [30]. Partial car reductions, cap- tured by the options of Less car transport, Shift to active transport and Shift to public transport in our sample, have an average mitigation potential between 0.6 and 1.0 tCO2eq/cap. These options are generally limited to replacing short and urban car trips with alternative transportation modes or reducing leisure trips [43, 66–68], which constitute a relatively small portion of all travel and its embodied emissions [58, 69, 70]. Yet, active and public transport alternatives have much lower carbon intensities per travel km [58, 71, 72]. Active and public transport are char- acterized by average carbon intensities at 0.00 and 0.09 kgCO2eq km−1, while individualized motorized transport at 0.23 kgCO2eq km−1 [58]. Telecommut- ing practices reduce commute emissions between 1.4 and 0.1 (mean of 0.4) tCO2eq/cap, while Car-pooling and car-sharing and Fuel efficient driving have an aver- age carbon savings of 0.3 tCO2eq/cap. The practice of ride-hailing, or receiving transportation from an unlicensed taxi service, may result in an increase in emissions as a result of ‘deadheading’, the travelled miles without a passenger between hired rides [73]. For example, a non-pooled ride-hailing trip generates 47% greater emissions per mile compared to a private car trip of an average fuel efficiency [73]. The num- ber of passenger sharing the trip makes a substantial difference in terms of mitigation potential, as well as the type of trip that is displaced (e.g. private driving, public transit, walking). Thus, the shift from public transport to active transport [43] offers only marginal mitigation potential per capita (figure 3). The differences in assumed travelled distance explain why options for reducing car travel alto- gether may show lower mitigation potential com- pared to a shift to alternatives of internal combus- tion engine vehicles (ICEV). The Shift to battery elec- tric vehicle (BEV) from ICEV has mitigation poten- tial between 5.4 and −1.9 tCO2eq/cap, with an aver- age and median of 2.0 tCO2eq/cap. Carbon reduc- tion potential varies between 3.1 and −0.2 (mean of 0.7) tCO2eq/cap for (plug-in) hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV/HEV), and between 5.8 and −3.4 (mean of 0) tCO2eq/cap for fuel cell vehicles (FCV). The carbon intensity of the electricity mix (widely varying across countries [61]) is crucial for the GWP of BEVs [61, 74–77], where the electricity mix alone was found to explain almost 70% of the variability in LCA results [77]. Furthermore, while modelling studies are often based on the average grid carbon intensity, the mar- ginal emissions factor may be substantially higher if additional demand is met by fossil-fuel thermal plants [61, 77], e.g. 35% higher in the UK [61]. Fuel con- sumption is the most influential factor affecting the GWP of ICEV, HEV and PHEV [75]. PHEV have a similar electricity consumption to that of BEV when driving electric [76].

The 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile are noted with lines, with the options ordered by medians. The supplementary spreadsheet sheet contains an overview of all options. For transport, we adopted the estimate of 15 000 km per passenger per year in the OECD [61], 1000 km in China [62] and 24 000 km in the USA [62, 63] for studies which do not specify annual travel. the proportion of coal electricity is 20% or larger) 78] eliminates any potential GHG savings with the shift to FCV. The main advantage of a FCV com- pared to a BEV is the higher range and quick refilling of the tank [76, 78]; yet, the necessary H2 filling sta- tion infrastructure is currently lacking [76]. We noted substantial differences in the system boundary and modelling approaches, which may also influence the mitigation ranges. Energy and material efficiency (e.g. more efficient combustion engine, lightweight materials, improved fuel economy, cleaner fuels) [74, 79–82] brings a reduction between 1.46 and 0.01 (mean of 0.3) tCO2eq/cap. Yet, there has been a clear trend of increased number of vehicles [68], travelled dis- tance per person [61] and increased mass of light- duty vehicles [81], which offset efficiency improve- ments with transport emissions still on the rise [68]. Differences in ranges may be explained by assumptions about recycling rates and material sub- stitution factors, vehicle lifetime, class and drive cycle and other factors [79, 81]. We could not evaluate annual mitigation potential from biofuels, as most studies communicate mitig- ation potential in terms of functional unit (e.g. per MJ of fuel), without further discussions of travelled distance and vehicle efficiency. There are large uncer- tainties around the mitigation potentials of biofuels due to inconsistencies in scope definition (e.g. sys- tem boundary and functional unit), assumptions (e.g. impacts of infrastructure and coproduction), tech- nological choices, and data sources [83]. If system boundaries are expanded to include indirect LUC, physical land constraints from food and feed, and biodiversity conservation as well as the temporal effects on natural carbon stocks, biofuels are revealed as less attractive if not detrimental option for climate change mitigation [84, 85]. 7 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 (2020) 093001 D Ivanova et al Table 2. Eligibility criteria. See the supplementary materials for more details on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria Eligible population/setting No geographical restriction and focus on household consumption Mitigation potential not directly linked to households (e.g. government spending) Eligible intervention: Con- sumption options by con- sumption domain • Direct reduction—consumption reduc- tion, shift between consumption cat- egories, and curtailment. Examples include living car-free or avoiding flights (transport) [30], consuming fewer calories (food) [55] and conserve energy at home (housing) [56] • Indirect reduction—changes in con- sumption patterns, changes in use behavior and changes in disposal pat- terns. Examples include carpooling (transport), sharing of food surplus (food), or equipment maintenance (housing) [57] • Direct improvement—purchases of products that are more efficient in use or produced more efficiently. Examples include opting for electric vehicles (transport) [58], plant-based diet (food) [30, 55] and renewable energy (housing) [30]. • Indirect improvement—changes in disposal behavior. Examples include recycling batteries (transport), food packaging (food), electrical appliances (housing). Mitigation options beyond the adopted framework [59] were out of scope. This includes macro-economic or industrial energy efficiency measures and techno- logical solutions, producer incentives or other options on the supply side; popula- tion [11] measures; mitigation potential of policies Outcome: Mitigation poten- tial and lifecycle emissions Mitigation potential assessed through annual carbon savings in kilograms/tons CO2-equivalents per capita, converting GHGs (e.g. CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6) to equi- valent amounts of CO2 (e.g. GWP100). Focus only on direct emissions [57] (e.g. well-to-wheel LCAs) or carbon intensit- ies in functional units with no estimate of consumption; system-wide effects and potential for income rebound effects [41– 43]. Consumption activities with high car- bon intensity [3, 60] should be considered to avoid rebound. Study types Supply chain lifecycle GHG emissions through LCA review studies and MRIO studies, physical trade flow or hybrid mod- elling studies, studies on re-designing of consumption. Systematic maps and reviews with only narrative synthesis; mitigation assessment through regression coefficients. 3.2. Food Figure 4 provides an overview of various consump- tion options in the food domain. The majority of reviewed studies covered the potential GHG reduc- tion associated with a change of diet and a reduction in food waste. The mitigation potential associated with a diet change involving a reduction in the amount of animal products consumed varies between 2.1 and 0.4 tCO2eq/cap (mean of 0.9 tCO2eq/cap) for a Vegan diet, between 1.5 and 0.01 (0.5) for a Vegetarian diet, and between 2.0 and −0.1 (0.6) for Mediterranean and similar diet—e.g. Atlantic and New Nordic. The three types of diets have median mitigation potential of 0.9, 0.5 and 0.4 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. Adopting more Sustainable diet or a Shift to lower carbon meats is also associated with sizable reductions, with an aver- age annual reduction of 0.5 tCO2eq/cap. The carbon intensity per calorie/kg of primary product is sub- stantially lower for vegetal foods compared to rumin- ants, non-ruminants and dairy [11, 86–88], with meat producing more emissions per unit of energy due to energy losses at each trophic level [89]. Emis- sions associated with land use change (LUC) are also most significant for meat-intensive diets [90], due to increases in pasture land and arable land for growing feed. Nutrition guidelines diets optimized with regards to health guidelines (generally including a reduction in the red meat intake and increase in plant-based foods) are associated with more moderate potential reductions between 1.3 and 0.01 tCO2eq/cap (mean of 0.3 tCO2eq/cap). 8 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 (2020) 093001 D Ivanova et al Improved cooking equipment is associated with strong mitigation potential amounting to a mean and a median of 0.6 tCO2eq/cap. Cooking methods, fuels, choice of food and cook-ware, use and management of the cook-ware as well as storage time and space are all relevant factors [91, 92]. Other options for carbon footprint reductions in the food domain focus on the production methods, transportation, seasonality and processing of food products. Organic food have lower emissions com- pared to conventionally produced food, with an aver- age annual mitigation potential of 0.5 tCO2eq/cap and a median of 0.4 tCO2eq/cap. This mitigation potentials is primarily attributable to the increased soil carbon storage and reductions of fertilizers and other agro-chemicals [93–95]. Yet, increases in GHG emissions from organic food for the same diet are not uncommon [93, 94, 96], due to lower crop and livestock yields of organic agriculture and the potential increase in production and associated LUC [93]. Opting for Regional and local food and Sea- sonal and fresh food involves average reductions of 0.4 and 0.2 tCO2eq/cap. One of the advantages of producing and consuming food in its natural sea- son is that it does not require high-energy input from artificial heating or lighting [92, 97], thus reducing the embodied GHG emissions. Producing and consuming locally may reduce emissions from transportation and abate impact displacement over- all [92], provided there are not large increases in energy requirements (e.g. in the case of heated green- house production or through the use of fertilizer [98, 99]). Regional production requiring the use of heat- ing systems (e.g. fresh vegetables in the beginning of the growing season) may be associated with higher emissions compared to even substantial long-distance transport emissions from production sites without heating [100]. We also note substantial mitigation potential associated with the reduction in consumed food and waste. Food sufficiency—implying a reduction in the overall food intake—and Food waste reduc- tion options mitigate an average of 0.3 tCO2eq/cap and a median of 0.1 tCO2eq/cap. Food waste studies generally make a distinction between avoidable and potentially avoidable waste, which are said to amount to 80% [101] of all food waste. Food waste manage- ment of unavoidable food waste is associated with more modest average mitigation potential of 0.03 tCO2eq/cap. There are large uncertainties [93, 102–105] asso- ciated with environmental (e.g. emissions arising from biological processes, LUC and highly integrated production such as beef and dairy), nutritional data (e.g. consumption and waste, weighting factors for gender and age). Impact assessment studies gener- ally do not consider emissions associated with LUC [102], which is estimated to contribute between 9% and 33% of the total livestock emissions (primarily attributable to feed imports) [93, 102]. Furthermore, even though food is a basic good (see SM figure 2), the distribution of diets and their embodied GHG impacts is largely unequal [106]. For example, 20% of diets with the highest carbon contribution in the USA account for more than 45% of the total food-related emissions, mostly linked to meat consumption [106]. 3.3. Housing The methodological differences were particularly strong for the reviewed studies in the housing domain, where mitigation potential was quantified per kWh of energy use, kg of primary material [107], embodied and operational energy per m2 of living space, unit of fuel, thermal insulation per surface unit [108] and others. The mitigation options with the highest potential on average include purchasing Renewable electricity and Producing own renewable electricity with average values of 1.5 (ranging between 2.5 and 0.3) and 1.3 (ranging between 4.8 and 0.1) tCO2eq/cap (figure 5). The two options have median mitigation potential of 1.6 and 0.6 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. The mitiga- tion potential of adopting renewable technologies is dependent on the energy source [109] and a wide range of contextual factors [110]—e.g. type of electri- city to manufacture renewable technologies, location (affecting the amount of energy that can be produced in the use phase), and the way technologies are used and maintained [110]. Other effective infrastructure-related options associated with space heating include Refurbish- ment and renovation, opting for Heat pump and Renewable-based heating, which offer an average mit- igation potential of 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. The shift to a Passive house is asso- ciated with an average reduction potential of 0.5 tCO2eq/cap (based on estimates by three studies), excluding GHG emissions associated with changes in infrastructure. The carbon intensity of materials and sources [66, 109], infrastructure [66] and geograph- ical differences in energy and heating requirements and temperature tolerance [58] are all key factors for the absolute mitigation potential associated with these options. The reviewed mitigation potential of Smart metering varies between 1.1 and 0 tCO2eq/cap, with an average of 0.2 tCO2eq/cap. Smart meter- ing improves household awareness of their energy consumption and support energy reduction activit- ies (e.g. it may encourage retrofitting of houses or change of appliances and equipment) [111]. These indirect effects are generally not captured in pilot studies [110]. Factors such as climate differences, dwelling type and share of renewables in the local grid are of crucial importance for the carbon savings potential [111]. Less living space and co-housing—which includes options such as smaller living space (and hence less 9 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 (2020) 093001 D Ivanova et al Figure 4.

The supplementary spreadsheet contains an overview of all options. heating and construction), collective living with oth- ers and renting out guest rooms for other people to live in—offer carbon reductions of up to 1.0 tCO2eq/cap, and an average of 0.3 tCO2eq/cap. When people live together, they tend to share space heat- ing, cooling, lighting and the structure of the com- mon living space, appliances, tools and equipment [24, 112, 113]. While these estimates of household economies of scale from shared living are only limited to the housing domains, sharing within households extends to other types of consumption (e.g. shar- ing food and cooking together) [113]. Furthermore, the energy use reductions associated with an addi- tional household member tend to be lower for large households compared to small households [113]. As building size is the most important factor for home energy consumption, downsizing may substan- tially reduce housing-related emissions and energy use [114]. However, there are significant structural (e.g. lack of adequate alternatives), psychological (e.g. attachment) and security barriers (e.g. loss of own- ership) related to downsizing [114].Other behavioral interventions such as Hot water saving and Lowering room temperature by 1 ◦C–3 ◦C bring about an aver- age saving of 0.3 and 0.1 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. 3.4. Other consumption Finally, other consumption options with substan- tial mitigation potential include not having a pet and sharing and consumption of services instead of goods with median mitigation potential around 0.3 tCO2eq/cap (figure 6). The service/sharing economy includes options such as opting for local, non-market and community services, share and repair. Strategies encouraging sharing include adequate design and infrastructure for durability, recyclability, reuse and product longevity [82] and incentives for multi- household living [58], grassroots initiatives and 10 Environ.

Yet, studies also warn that peer- to-peer strategies do not necessarily translate into car- bon footprint reductions due to extra income and induced consumption [116]. 4. Discussion and conclusions 4.1. Mitigation potential of consumption options One contribution of this study is the systematic provi- sion of mitigation ranges across various consumption domains and the harmonization of results from dif- ferent methodologies, scopes and assumptions within the same framework (figure 7). The top consumption options (by medians) include substantial changes in car travel (living car-free, shifting to electric vehicles and public transport), air travel reductions, use of renewable electricity and more sustainable heating (renewable-based heating and heat pump), refur- bishment and renovation, a shift to a plant-based diet and improved cooking equipment. The top ten consumption options together (accounting for the overlap of car travel alternatives) yield an average annual mitigation potential of 9.2 tCO2eq/cap. While crudely estimated, this indicates a substantial mitig- ation potential of already available low-carbon con- sumption options towards achieving the 1.5 ◦C–2 ◦C target. Across world regions, the average consumption- based carbon footprints vary between 1.9 and 0.4 tCO2eq/cap for food, 4.6 and 0.2 tCO2eq/cap for transport, 3.7 and 0.5 tCO2eq/cap for housing, and 3.16 and 0.4 tCO2eq/cap for other consumption [2, 3] (see SM figure 1). United States and Australia stand out with the highest average per capita carbon foot- prints in our model: with 2.2 and 2.5 tCO2eq/cap for food, 4.7 and 5.5 tCO2eq/cap for transport, 5.8 and 4.3 tCO2eq/cap for housing, and 4.0 and 3.9 tCO2eq/cap for other consumption, respectively. 11 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 (2020) 093001 D Ivanova et al Figure 6. Annual mitigation potential of consumption options for housing measured in tCO2eq/cap. The figure is based on a sample of 13 review articles and 17 consumption options. Negative values (in the red area) represent the potential for backfire. The dots represent single reviewed studies and the x–s—the average mitigation potential within the same consumption option (options ordered by averages). The 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile are noted with lines, with the options ordered by medians. The supplementary spreadsheet sheet contains an overview of all options. Yet, the carbon allowances according to the climate targets by 2050 are substantially lower: 0.4 tCO2eq/cap to food, 0.2 to shelter, 0.7 to travel, 0.4 to goods and 0.4 to services, amounting to a total of 2.1 tCO2eq/cap [11]. The interconnected nature of these strategies need to be recognized in order to adequately respond in mitigating climate change. For example, studies warn about the potential increase in LUC-emissions with the shift to organic; yet, if this shift occurs in parallel to shifts in diets and better food waste management, the conversion of natural or semi-natural vegetation to cropland may be reduced substantially (figure 4). Furthermore, co-benefits associated with upscaling these mitigation options have also been widely dis- cussed [68, 71, 117]. 4.2. Limitations This review is limited to the English language liter- ature published since 2011. More relevant evidence could be captured if the scope is extended to other languages, e.g. capturing more evidence from non- OECD countries. Moreover, although we used a very comprehensive set of search terms, there is a risk that we missed literature that did not list them in their title, abstract or key words. Furthermore, as we did not perform an extensive search for the other con- sumption domain, we may have omitted key options and potentials. We may have also missed relevant research through the adoption of machine learning and the focus on peer-reviewed literature. Includ- ing grey literature (such as theses and governmental reports) would decrease susceptibility to publication bias and resulting inclination of peer-reviews literat- ure towards more ‘positive’ results. The included studies often do not report suf- ficient methodological details in order to judge rigor of the primary data included. The studies differ largely in assessment method and method- ological choices, system boundary, and modelling 12 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 (2020) 093001 D Ivanova et al Figure 7.

For example, most food-related LCAs adopt a system boundary at the farm gate or retail gate [102] (thus, suffering from truncation errors), and exclude consumer losses, impacts associated with the consumption and end-of-life stages, and LUC. LCA reviews generally do not publish an a-priori protocol, conduct a comprehensive and transpar- ent search for studies or discuss an explicit set of 13 Environ. Res.

The dependent variable is the annual carbon mitigation potential in tCO2eq per capita. inclusion/exclusion criteria. Studies lack transpar- ency with regards to critical appraisal and data extrac- tion, and rarely evaluate the heterogeneity statistic- ally (see the CEESAT tool [118]). IO studies generally disregard end-of-life stages, LUC emissions and the effects on natural carbon stocks. Most studies do not consider feedback effects in the global supply chains (e.g. the wider adop- tion of vegetarian diets is expected to influence the supply chains of hotels, restaurants, supermar- kets). Furthermore, the reviewed studies generally disregard embodied emissions in the new infrastruc- ture needed for the upscale of low-carbon prac- tices, e.g. the infrastructure of renewables, and the associated costs. Large-scale investments in energy- intensive industries and infrastructure have been shown to counter-balance and even outweigh the sectoral carbon efficiency gains, especially in fast- developing countries [119, 120]. Prior analysis of GHG emissions from existing and proposed infra- structure suggests that a cost-effective strategy to reduce committed emissions is to target the early retirement of electricity and industry infrastructure in the presence of affordable low-carbon alternatives [121]. Finally, other environmental indicators such as resource use and scarcity may differ substantially in their implications and prioritization of consumption options [55, 99]. A major obstacle with regards to external valid- ity (applicability to our research question) is that LCA reviews, in particular, communicate mitigation potential by various functional units [103] without providing the context of scale. We particularly excluded a number of housing-related LCA reviews as mitigation potential is solely communicated in terms of functional units. This makes the comparison with other environmental assessments (using differ- ent methodologies) and carbon targets/budgets very difficult. 4.3. Modifier effects Considerations about default-option are critical for the assessment of mitigation potential. While some studies present mitigation potential compared to averages, others compare to ‘high carbon’ consump- tion patterns [122]. Furthermore, there is a large uncertainty associated with basic assumptions about human behavior and public acceptability of demand- side mitigation options [82]. While we depict absolute reduction potential of various mitigation options— e.g. shift all car travel to public transport—partial adoptions may also be adopted, with relative reduc- tion potential easily calculated as a proportion of the ranges discussed in this paper. Geographical context and other location, impact assessment method, energy mix and carbon intens- ity and socio-demographics specifications were eval- uated in the fixed-effects model as potential factors that influence the mitigation potential ranges within consumption options (figure 8). 14 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 (2020) 093001 D Ivanova et al Table 3. A summary of the consumption options with the highest mitigation potential and ways to influence the infrastructural, institutional and behavioral carbon lock-ins associated with them. Consumption options with high mitigation potentials Overcoming infrastruc- tural lock-in Overcoming institutional lock-in Overcoming behavioral lock-in Dietary shift (e.g. vegan, vegetarian) Change land use prac- tices; Remove investment infrastructure supporting unsustainable and extract- ive industries Remove unsustainable sub- sidies in agriculture, e.g. for meat and dairy; Offer support for alternatives.; Encourage just transition for animal farmers; Better availability of low-carbon options in super- markets, restaurants, schools, etc; Coordinated efforts of health organizations and gov- ernment [89]; Ban advertising of high-carbon meats and other high-carbon items. Encourage low-carbon shared meals [127] and diets; Feedbacks for change in social norms and tra- ditions around food con- sumption [127], e.g. vegan food as default; Decouple veganism/vegetarianism from a particular social identity Transport mode shift (e.g. active, public transport), car-free More public transport infrastructure develop- ments for urban and long- distance travel, e.g. cycling lanes, buses, trains; More bike spaces on public trans- port Parking and zoning restric- tions, e.g. car-free zones and days; Vehicle and fuel tax increases and toll charges; Make driving less conveni- ent in urban areas; Enforce stricter air pollution stand- ards; Ban car advertising Raising awareness about co-benefits associated with active travel [58]; Social feedback with the visibility of cycling [127]; Decouple car travel from a particular social identity; Improve drivers awareness of cyclers and safety Reduction in overall travel demand More compact urban spaces and diverse land use [17] Allow for flexible working schemes and telecommuting; Halt air travel expansion; Ban flight advertising Carpooling and carsharing; Encourage telecommut- ing, moving into denser settlements Upscaling of electric vehicles Decarbonize the grid and meet potential additional capacity through renew- ables; Provision of charging infrastructure Sustained policy support, e.g. free public charging, tax and fee deductions, subsidies for low-income buyers; Enforce stricter air pollution standards Tackle charging time acceptance, range anxiety [61, 67, 75] Renewable-based heating and electricity Infrastructure investment in renewables Halt fossil fuel expansion/use and support upscaling of renewables; Incentivize decentralized electricity gen- eration, particularly for low- income households; Enforce stricter air pollution stand- ards; Encourage just trans- itions for fossil fuel workers; Fossil fuel divestment Raise public awareness and target NIMBY concerns Refurbishment and renova- tion Energy efficient construc- tion and equipment Enforce building standards; Encourage investment by dwelling owners and land- lords in the fabric of the building and energy effi- ciency as well as broader home improvements [115]; Encourage just transitions, e.g. consideration of fuel poverty; Remove inefficiency of listed building Public awareness around economic and environ- mental benefits; Reconcile investment incentives with householders’ images of home comfort [115] For food, mitigation potential estimates from North America, Australia and New Zealand of dietary changes are higher compared to EU estimates, while estimates from Asia are lower. In the context of food, LCA-based results were slightly higher compared to IO-based results. Methodological, geographic and socio-demographic factors explain 32% of the dif- ferences in mitigation potential within food-related options. Other potential modifier effects include the accounting of food and cooking losses [123] and LUC [102]; the magnitude of change/reduction of calories [90] and the share imported by air [11]; nutritional 15 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 (2020) 093001 D Ivanova et al guidelines [124]; the consideration of rebound effects and knock-on savings from food waste reduction or dietary change including avoided shopping and storage [101]; and other social and behavioral char- acteristics [103–105]. For transport, mitigation potential estimates from Australia and New Zealand are significantly higher than the European ones, while those from Asia are lower. IO-based estimates are substantially lower than the hybrid estimates in reviewed stud- ies. Geographic and methodological factors attrib- ute to 48% of the differences in mitigation potential within transport-related options. Additional mod- ifiers include fuel and vehicle characteristics [58, 74–76], travel distance and occupancy rate [58, 65], energy chain and infrastructure [125], driving [125], income group [65] as well as additional technical and behavioral factors [125]. The geographic location, methodology and energy mix are significant for the mitigation poten- tial ranges within housing options, attributing to 75% of the within options variance (figure 8). The loca- tion factor includes contextual factors influencing the supply of energy, e.g. the location of solar panels dur- ing use [110] and geographical differences in energy and heating requirements [58]. Additional modifier effects include the backup electricity mix, dwelling size, type and lifetime assumption, and additional social and infrastructural influences. 4.4. Policy recommendations Finally, we selected the top ranking consumption options and synthesized respective policy recom- mendations from the literature. Table 3 communic- ates a list with the options with the highest mitigation potential and potential actions towards overcoming the main infrastructural, institutional and behavioral carbon lock-ins [126]. While the table is informed by the reviewed literature, it should be noted that we did not conduct a systematic search specifically on target- ing actions towards overcoming carbon lock-ins. 4.5. Concluding remarks In times of a climate emergency, research and policy urgently needs to move beyond focusing on the effi- ciency of production and use of goods and services. The explicit consideration of the absolute scale of consumption and its implications for climate change and well-being is ever more relevant. There is a need for an open discussion about the overall scale of resource use and emissions and sustainable consump- tion corridors [128] towards remaining within plan- etary boundaries and satisfying human needs [34]. We conducted a comprehensive literature review to summarize and compare the reported GHG ranges of various consumption options, critically appraise results and uncertainties, clarify the methodological issues and modifier effects, and identify knowledge gaps to inform future research and policy. The priorities in terms of consumption options may dif- fer substantially depending on income, geographic location, energy context, other factors and carbon lock-ins. Still, consumption is intimately connected to issues of climate change, well-being and sustainab- ility, and thus needs critical attention. We find that the large majority of the house- hold carbon footprints can be mitigation with already available low-carbon consumption options. Challen- ging current patterns of consumption and the soci- etal dynamics through a critical assessment of infra- structural, institutional and behavioral lock-ins and potential rebound effects, therefore, needs to become a priority for successful climate change mitigation.
