Introduction Lithium secondary batteries are widely used for portable applications because of their high energy density of over 200 Wh kg−1. In recent years, lithium secondary batteries have found new applications in a rapidly expanding market, such as cellular phones, notebook PCs, camcorders, CD players and MP3 players. For this reason, the reliability of lithium secondary batteries is of increasing importance. Reliability-assessment of lithium secondary batteries can be divided into three groups; initial performance tests, lifetime endurance, and safety/abuse tests. Of these three, safety/abuse tests and life cycle tests are the most important. In the case of lithium secondary batteries, the safety of the batteries is no less important than the lifetime. If the battery is out of order, it could not only malfunction, but potentially injure consumers as well. 1.1. Life distribution The Weibull distribution is an empirical, ﬂexible distribu- tion that expresses various modes of failure. It is widely used in ∗ Corresponding author.

Two parameters, shape parameter (β) and scale parameter (η), deﬁne the type of Weibull distribution. Shape parameter explains the types of failure, and scale param- eter explains the characteristic life cycle of devices. The scale parameter is the lifetime for which 63.2% of the devices have failed. It is analogous to the mean of the normal distribution. The mean time to failure (MTTF) of lithium secondary batteries can be described as the number of charge/discharge cycles until failure. The failure rate (λ), reliability function (R), cumulative dis- tribution function (F), and probability density function (f) can be expressed as follows: λ(t) = β η ( t η )β−1,R(t) = 1 − F (t) = e−(t/η)β, F (t) = 1 − e −(t/η)β,f (t) = β η ( t η )β−1 e−(t/η)β where, η and β are positive. 1.2. Types of failure according to shape parameter The failure mode of devices can be determined by the shape parameter. For example, a shape parameter of 0.5 describes that the devices will have defect in the initial step. This can be caused by poor assembly or quality. A shape parameter of 0378-7753/$ – see front matter © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.208 S.-W. Eom et al. / Journal of Power Sources 174 (2007) 954–958 955 1.0 represents a random failure step, such that device failure will occur independent of time. Reasons for this type of failure tend to be complicated, but could include poor maintenance. Failures of electronic devices belong to this case. Devices which have a shape parameter of 3.0 have been affected by initial abrasion phenomena. And if the shape param- eter of a device is 6.0, then the failure mode of that device will be abrasion caused by aging. Bearings and other components and other component which can be corroded easily belong to this case. 2. Experimental Lithium ion batteries were tested to verify the life distribution of lithium secondary batteries. They have 3.7 V of nominal volt- age and 1000 mAh. Prior to testing, all external safety devices outside of the battery, for example PCM (Protect Circuit Mod- ule), were eliminated as shown in Fig. 1. The batteries were electrically connected to the charge/discharger so that their current and voltage during charge and discharge periods could be controlled and moni- tored. The time durations of the charge and discharge periods were controlled using a MACCOR charge-discharger (series 2000, USA) and its software. To analyze life distribution and to calculate each life distribution parameter, we used MINITAB statistical software (release 13.1). As proposed by and RS C 0017 [7] and IEC 61960 [8], batter- ies were charged at a constant current of 0.5ItA until the voltage of the batteries was increased to 4.2 V, and charged at a constant voltage of 4.2 V until the charging current fell to 0.1ItA. After the charging step, batteries were discharged at a constant cur- rent of 0.5ItA until the voltage of the batteries fell to 2.7 V. These charge/discharge steps were repeated in an ambient temperature of 23 ◦C until the capacity fell to 80% of initial capacity. For experimental purposes, we deﬁned failure as occurring at 80% of initial capacity. And we conducted safety/abuse test according to standard of IEC 62133 [9]. 3. Cycle life analysis 3.1. Cycle test and life distribution analysis Results of discharge capacity were obtained according to the cycle number and failure time of each sample as shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 1. Test sample. Fig. 2. Results of the life cycle tests. and Table 1, respectively. The life cycle of the tested cells was 637–1520 cycles, and the MTTF was 1024 cycles. From these data, we considered four kinds of life distri- bution; Weibull distribution, exponential distribution, Normal distribution, and logistic distribution as shown in Fig. 3. Using the Anderson–Darling adjustments, results indi- cated that the life cycles of lithium secondary batteries were adequately represented by a Weibull distribution. Anderson–Darling adjustment values provide information about goodness-of-ﬁt, such that the lower values indicates better cor- respondence with the distribution mode. We achieved Weibull shape scale parameters of β = 3.55 and η = 1138, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the probability plot for the life cycles of lithium secondary batteries, which is adequately represented by a Weibull distribution. The corresponding two- sided approximate 95% conﬁdence limits plot as curves. 3.2. B10 life and zero failure tests If the failure rate of certain devices is 100q%, then the life of the device at that point of time can be deﬁned as B100q life. B10 or B5 life is generally deﬁned by the reliability engineer. B100q life of batteries can be represented by the following equation [3]: B100q = η{−ln(1 − q)}1/β (1) Table 1 Failure time (cycles) of tested samples Specimen number Failure time 01 1373 02 1470 03 1520 04 1427 05 892 06 814 07 777 08 637 09 927 10 688 11 857 12 886 956 S.-W. Eom et al. / Journal of Power Sources 174 (2007) 954–958 Fig. 3. Four kinds of probability plot for the life cycles of lithium secondary batteries: (a) Weibull distribution (Anderson–Darling adjustment: 1.682), (b) exponential distribution (Anderson–Darling adjustment: 3.521), (c) normal distribution (Anderson–Darling adjustment: 1.767), and (d) logistic distribution (Anderson–Darling adjustment: 1.804). For example, when β = 3.5 and η = 1140 (cycles), B10 life can be expressed as below B10 = 1140 ×{−ln(1 − 0.1)}1/3.5 = 599.3 (cycles) That is, 10% of the cumulative hazard probability is found when performed up to 600 cycles. When the shape parameter is known in the Weibull dis- tribution, the estimation of scale parameter (η) with a lower conﬁdence limit of 100(1 − α)% can be represented as follows: η = [2ntβ c /χ2 α(2r + 2)]1/β (2) where tc is test time, χ2 α(2r + 2) is the Chi-square distribu- tion with (2r + 2) degrees of freedom at the conﬁdence limit Fig. 4. Plot of the Weibull ﬁt with the failure-time data for cyclic life tests of lithium secondary batteries. The curved lines represent the corresponding two-sided approximate 95% conﬁdence limits for the function. of 100(1 − α)%, and γ is the number of failed samples in the life cycle test. In the reliability demonstration test, a test plan with a minimal sample size (N) for the Weibull distribution of a shape parameter can be performed successfully when no failures have occurred during the test time tc of N samples. The sample size depends on the conﬁdence limit of 100(1 − α)%, 100qth Weibull percentile, test time tc and the shape parameter. Thus, the sample size to guarantee the expected life of the device should be decided as a constant number larger than the result of the following relations [10]: N ≥ ( t0 tc )β ln α ln(1 − q) (3) where t0 is the expected lifetime. If the number of failure samples is zero, a statistical quantity of χ2 α(2γ + 2)/2 in the Chi-square distribution can be calculated as χ2 α(2)/2 ≈−ln(α). The acceptance criterion of the zero failure condition in the reliability demonstration test can be changed by using the Eq. (3). Finally, B100q life with a lower conﬁdence limit of 100(1 − α)% in service has the following relationship B100q = [{ 2Ntc χ2 α(2γ + 2) } × ln(1 − q)−1]1/β (4) When we calculate the number of test samples according to Eq. (3), we obtain 22 test samples at a conﬁdence level of 90% and 29 test samples at conﬁdence level of 95%. S.-W. Eom et al. / Journal of Power Sources 174 (2007) 954–958 957 4. Safety/abuse tests 4.1. Overcharge test Overcharge test is to evaluate the ability of a cell to with- stand a charger malfunction where the upper voltage if only limited by the charger. If battery is overcharged, internal pres- sure and temperature of battery will be increased by reason of abnormal chemical reactions (exothermic reactions); reduc- tion of electrolyte by the anode, thermal decomposition of the electrolyte, oxidation of the electrolyte by the cathode, thermal decomposition of the anode, thermal decomposition of binder in the electrode and thermal decomposition of the cathode material structure. Consequently, it is possible that battery is exploded or catches on ﬁre during the overcharge state. A full-discharged battery used in this test. Constant charge current of 0.5ItA applied to the battery until charge capacity reaches to 250% of rated capacity. Fig. 5 shows the result of overcharge test. Charge current is closely related to increasing of cell temperature. The higher charging current applied to the test cell, the more accelerated increasing of cell temperature. During the charge, cell voltage and cell temperature was not increased abruptly. Tested cells have a good balance between the heat generation and dissipation. As a result, any indication to identify smoke, explosion or ﬁre was not found. 4.2. Short circuit test External short circuit of batteries may occur when are con- nected with each other to make ‘battery pack system’, or they may be misused by users. If battery is in short circuit, tem- perature of the battery will be increased due to internal ‘joule heating’. So phenomenon of short circuit may lead to explosion or ﬁring of battery. The fully charged cell was subjected to a short circuit condi- tion with a total external resistance of less than 50 m\b. Test was conducted at room temperature, and continued until the cell case temperature has returned to a value within 10 ◦C of the original ambient temperature. Test was continued for 1 h. Fig. 6 is the results of short circuit test during the initial 0.2 h. Voltage of battery was falling down as soon as battery was short Fig. 5. The results of overcharge test. Fig. 6. The results of short circuit test. circuited. And ‘short circuit current’ was increased to about 65 A abruptly. However, in spite of ﬂow of high current, temperature of battery was increased no more than 90 ◦C. Based on these results, we found satisfaction in design of battery. 4.3. Forced discharge test This test is to evaluate the ability of a cell to withstand a forced deep discharge that could occur, during the discharge of a multi-cell, series conﬁguration battery pack if one cell has a lower capacity or is at a greater depth-of-discharge than the other cells. The fully charged battery was discharged for 12.5 h with a constant of 0.1ItA in an ambient temperature of 23 ◦C Fig. 7 shows the results of this test. After normal discharge copper current collector of anode starts dissolve electrochemically, and deposited on the cath- ode. So open-circuit-voltage of batteries becomes 0 V. But any dangerous incident was not occurred. 4.4. Nail penetration test During penetration test, battery is penetrated with a steel nail, and then consequently internal electrical short circuit happens inside the battery. For this nail penetration test, a nail with the velocity of less than 1 cm s−1 and the diameter of 5 mm penetrated into the center of electrode of the fully charged test cell. The orientation of the Fig. 7. The results of forced discharge test. 958 S.-W. Eom et al. / Journal of Power Sources 174 (2007) 954–958 Fig. 8. The results of nail penetration test. Fig. 9. Specimen after thermal exposure test. penetration was perpendicular to the electrode plates, and the test cell was penetrated thoroughly by nail. Soon after the test, cell is pierced by the nail, temperature of test cell increased to 82 ◦C caused by internal short of bat- tery as shown in Fig. 8. However although rapid increasing of temperature, the battery did not have smoke. 4.5. Thermal exposure test A thermal exposure test is the most fundamental environ- mental safety/abuse test. The failure mode is an explosion by an internal short circuit. When batteries are subjected to higher temperature than melting temperature of separator, direct con- tact between cathode and anode will be occurred. The melting temperature of separators is 125 and 155 ◦C for polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. The used separator adapted to test batteries was polyethylene. So this test carried out in ambient temperature of 130 ◦C for 30 min. Fig. 9 shows the photograph of specimen after thermal expo- sure test. The batteries were swelled but their cases were not opened. 5. Conclusion In this study, the MTTF of the failure time data of tested samples was calculated as 1024 cycles. A Weibull plot based on these lifetime data showed a good linear regression with a lower Anderson–Darling value against the time to failure in the charge/discharge cycle test. Consequently, a shape parame- ter of 3.5 and a scale parameter of 1140 were obtained by the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) with MINITAB statisti- cal software. By using the parameters representing the Weibull distribution, a reliability demonstration test method including the criterion on the failure, test condition such as sample size and test time to assess the reliability of lithium secondary batter- ies was determined. Speciﬁcally, in order to assess the reliability of the lithium secondary battery by the B10 life of 600 cycles indicating the 10% Weibull percentile at the conﬁdence limit of 90% and 95%, the minimum sample size of batteries shall be larger than 22 and 29, respectively in the case of zero failure conditions during a test time of 600 cycles. And the safety/abuse evaluation and the failure analysis of lithium secondary batteries were performed. All of the results were enough to satisfy the IEC 62133 (2002) conditions. References [1] W.
