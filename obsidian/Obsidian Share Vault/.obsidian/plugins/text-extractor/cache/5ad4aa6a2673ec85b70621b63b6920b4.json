However, understanding how these characteristics and their aggregated impacts will change with new PV deployments is challenging given the limited and highly site dependent availability of high-resolution PV output data. This study proposes a methodology to generate a synthetic 4-second utility-scale PV output time series for a PV plant anywhere in a power system using hourly satellite-derived irradiance data, which is globally available, to select a set of 4-second output from models created from four PV plants operating within the Australian national electricity market (NEM). The method resamples 4-second clear sky PV output index variability from statistical distributions which are binned according to hourly clear sky index pairs of global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance. The method is cross-validated against the observations from the four utility PV plants located in different climate zones. The monthly Kolmogorov-Smirnov Integral (KSI) tests on the modelled variability distributions show that they are not statistically different from the observed time series with most KSI values remaining under 80%. Lastly, the method is applied to all 20 utility PV plants that were registered in the NEM as of 2019. The modelled result shows good agreement with the measured aggregated 4-second variability. Hence, our method can be usefully applied for modelling the short-term variability of future power system scenarios with high PV penetrations if at least some existing utility PV plant generation data is available. 1. Introduction Increasing short-term variability of aggregate PV output with high penetration of utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) plants raises challenges for power system operation. Such short-term variability can increase the requirement for balancing reserves (ElNozahy and Salama, 2013). Making matters more difficult, high PV penetrations also displace the conventional generators that are often called on to 2 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

AIP Publishing LLC, 13(2), p. 026301. doi: 10.1063/5.0033855. provide such frequency management services (Keeratimahat et al., 2016). Understanding and characterising short-term utility PV plant variability is, therefore, key to integrating high PV penetrations. Such characterisation will allow estimation of future requirements for short-term balancing and frequency control services required to manage security with high penetrations of PV. While a number of studies (Klima et al., 2018; Marcos et al., 2011a; Mills et al., 2011) have analysed the variability of existing PV-plants, we still require good estimates of the very short-term variability of proposed PV plants, and the overall aggregate variability of higher PV penetrations. However, due to the limited number of utility-scale PV plants currently in operation (20 PV plants at the time of study) with typically commercial-in-confidence data restrictions, and the lack of publicly available ground measured solar resource data from these sites, a large volume of high temporal resolution (order of seconds) PV output and solar irradiance data is simply not available in order to model plant variability under the afore mentioned scenarios. In this paper, we propose a method which utilises 4- second PV plant output data from four existing PV plants, as a basis to generate synthetic PV output time series at secondary locations which only have hourly satellite derived GHI and DNI data available. In this study, 4 seconds is the temporal resolution of interest because it has been widely used by many power system operators such as Australia (AEMO), California (CAISO), US Midcontinent (MISO) and Texas (ERCOT) for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) to manage system frequency deviation. Similarly, hourly satellite derived GHI and DNI are utilised due to their global availability and validation against ground measurements from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations (Ohmura et al., 1998; Yang and Bright, 2020). The methodology we present builds on the method proposed by (Grantham et al., 2017) to generate 5-minute synthetic irradiance data from hourly irradiance observations. Our method differs from Grantham’s method due to the inclusion of additional processing steps to account for the spatial smoothing characteristics of utility scale PV plants, the generation of PV plant traces rather than irradiance traces, and the time resolution of the analysis (4 seconds vs. 5-minutes in Grantham et al.). Hence, to the authors’ best knowledge, our study is the first to present such a method for generating synthetic, very short-term (4 seconds) utility PV generation traces for any location using global satellite derived irradiance data and available utility PV plant SCADA data. 4-second PV plant output data, which is the required input for data training in our methodology, should be commonly available from many power system operators, as discussed, and is publicly available from AEMO for the purposes of calculating the contributions of plant to frequency deviations and, therefore, apportioning these costs. This work, therefore, should be of interest to both utility project developers and power system operators and planners. Our method can assist utility PV developers to better understand the potential short-term variability of proposed projects, which is increasingly important as power system frequency control arrangements evolve to better manage short-term variability through technical requirements, and ‘causer pays’ costs on participants adding to such challenges. It will also be of interest to power system operators and planners seeking to better understand short-term variability challenges as utility PV penetrations grow and need to be managed through market reform and ensuring investments in appropriate capabilities. It should also be noted that the main purpose of building these synthetic time series power outputs is not to forecast generation at 4 seconds but to statistically capture the overall characteristics of 4-second ramping of generation for individual PV plants and in aggregate. 3 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

Section 4 describes the new method we have developed for generating high-resolution PV output time series data from the available PV output data. In Section 5, a validation of the methodology is carried out by comparing the statistical characteristics and uncertainty of the synthetically generated power output time series to the actual PV plant generation recorded by AEMO. Section 6 compares the modelled against measured 4-second variability of all PV plants currently operating in the NEM, and the paper concludes in Section 7. 2. Literature review The short-term variability of PV generation is caused by cloud intermittency (Klima et al., 2018). The correlation of PV output ramps between sites that are located less than 20 km apart are zero at a 1- minute timeframe (Hummon et al., 2013). Therefore, it can be concluded that there will be zero correlation between ramps at sites that are much further apart over a shorter timeframe of a few seconds. In that respect, sites can be treated as uncorrelated for the purposes of aggregating variability. However, there are likely to be seasonal weather patterns that increase the probability that cloudy periods will occur simultaneously at different locations. Therefore, to estimate aggregate variability for assessing power system impacts, it is important to model and evaluate each site separately before aggregating. Site specific factors that must be included in plant-level variability modelling include the DC capacity of the PV plant, which determines its area and therefore the effect of spatial smoothing; and its DC/AC ratio which determines the extent of output clipping due to AC capacity constraint during times of high solar irradiance. With the aim of using PV output data instead of irradiance data, several plant specific factors need to be accounted for in the model including the spatial smoothing effect which reduces the variability of plant output depending on the plant dimensions, and the plant’s DC/AC ratio which limits the output profile under otherwise high PV output conditions. The DC/AC ratio can be accounted for by excluding data affected by clipping from the training set, and normalising the data according to clear sky PV output allows it to be used to cover missing periods. Spatial smoothing, however, is more challenging. PV plant output data is the aggregate output of distributed arrays of PV modules, which see different irradiance at a single point in time as clouds pass over the array. In aggregate, the variability of the plant is reduced compared to the point variability, known as spatial smoothing. To account for the spatial smoothing effect when modelling large PV plants of any size at high time resolution, methods such as wavelet variability models or low-pass filters have been validated in the literature (Lave et al., 2013; Marcos et al., 2011b). High spatial resolution of gridded data source can also be used to estimate the spatial variability as reviewed in (Perez et al., 2016). Full application of these filters to generating synthetic data and modelling of dispersed distributed PV plants can be seen in Kim (2017), who synthesised one-minute resolution distributed PV output by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation for a single generating unit and then applied a smoothing algorithm to account for geographical dispersion. While the variability characteristic of a single distributed PV system can be assumed to be the same as one nearby and, hence, their aggregate output can be normalised by the smoothing method, this method cannot be applied to utility-scale PV plants as the dispersion pattern is different (Hoff and Perez, 2010). Utility-scale PV plants cover a large area with high power density (MW/km2). Synthetic generation models which include spatial decorrelation techniques are proposed in (Bright et al., 2017; Munkhammar and Widén, 2019; Tang et al., 2019). Some of these methods 4 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC. Keeratimahat, K., Copper, J., Bruce, A. and MacGill, I. (2021) ‘Generation of synthetic 4 s utility-scale PV output time series from hourly solar irradiance data’, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy. AIP Publishing LLC, 13(2), p. 026301. doi: 10.1063/5.0033855. generate synthetic irradiance time series with spatial coverage from a point-source measurement. With the use of PV output data in our study, the spatial smoothing of the PV output data used for training the model must also be characterised. Although many studies on aggregated PV output variability with spatial smoothing effect have been carried out (Klima et al., 2018; Lave et al., 2012; Marcos et al., 2012; Murata et al., 2009), these studies focus on a few PV plants across large area (> 100’s km) which are not relevant to the scaling portion of a single PV plant because the distance is too long. The spatial smoothing effect on PV variability can be modelled by using the method proposed in (Hoff and Perez, 2010) which scales the standard deviation of the variability according to plant size. Theoretically, the scaled standard deviation can be used to adjust the original statistical distribution of PV output variability to account for the spatial smoothing. The characteristic of short-term solar irradiance and PV output variability was found to be a non-gaussian distribution. While (Polo et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2018) suggest a beta distribution for solar irradiance and variability with 10 minutes and 1 minute resolution respectively, a q-exponential distribution fitting to solar irradiance variability is found to be a better fit for seconds resolution in (Anvari et al., 2016). While there are no proposed methods in the literature for synthesising high-resolution PV output data, several models have been developed to create synthetic solar irradiance data series with a temporal resolution of minutes from hourly data for a site. Polo et al. (2011) proposed a method based on the addition of random fluctuations to the measured hourly mean values, with a different limit imposed on the maximum magnitude of the fluctuations depending on the sky conditions. Zhang et al. (2018) also proposed a random additive method based on a generalised linear model. These two methods use a statistical distribution of solar irradiance and variability as a basis, and, therefore, have the potential to be adapted to PV data using the approach described above of scaling the variability distribution to account for spatial smoothing. Grantham et al. (2017) instead used a bootstrapping approach to select appropriate high-resolution data from another site. The bootstrapping was performed by finding the closest pairs of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI) at the source (with high-resolution data) and modelled sites to select a one hour ordered set of 5-minute clear sky index data from the source, an approach that improved the stochastic representation of the modelled site and maintained the autocorrelation characteristics within the hourly interval. The use of GHI and DNI pairs in this approach also maintains the correlation between GHI and DNI at any time interval which is important for PV output modelling because the PV output relies on both irradiance components. This bootstrapping approach based on GHI, DNI pairs can, therefore, be applied to modelling PV output. A number of studies have used increasing sophistication to improve the stochastic characterisation of irradiance fluctuations, depending on the meta-conditions. (Larrañeta et al., 2015) improved Polo et al. (2011)’s random additive method using a perturbation coefficient for hazy days, although it should be noted that this method was specifically used to model DNI. Bright et al. (2015) used a broader range of weather data including wind speed, pressure and cloud height as inputs into the model. These weather parameters were processed with Markov chains to produce stochastic settings for hourly sky conditions and synthetic 1-minute cloud cover. Markov chain models have also been used by (Hofmann et al., 2014; Meteonorm, 2020; Munkhammar and Widén, 2018; Ngoko et al., 2014; Shepero et al., 2019) for modelling synthetic GHI and DNI time series at 1 minute resolution. While Markov chain approaches have resulted in improved models of synthetic irradiance and could potentially to be adapted for the use of PV output data instead of irradiance data, to date these 5 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

AIP Publishing LLC, 13(2), p. 026301. doi: 10.1063/5.0033855. methods have been used to model the time series based on a single irradiance component (either GHI or DNI). Adapting these methods for using PV output data would require a decomposition model to separate GHI into DNI and diffused horizontal irradiance (DHI). In addition, a number of the more refined methods (Bright et al., 2017, 2015; Ngoko et al., 2014) require several weather parameters at high resolution which are not widely publicly available. Fernández-Peruchena and Gastón (2016) calculated clear sky index from 1-minute GHI time series and used extraterrestrial horizontal irradiance on a specific day to generate a variety of 1-minute time series for another site for a given day from hourly GHI values. The method was developed from one year of data. The best-match time series were selected by a clustering approach using the Euclidean distance between the hourly values of generated and measured GHI obtained from BSRN stations as a control parameter to ensure that the daily means modelled are close to those calculated from the hourly data. A number of other authors have also used clustering approaches (Frimane et al., 2019; Peruchena et al., 2018). Similar to Grantham et al. (2017)’s approach, these methods allow the original autocorrelation from point to point to be maintained, however they may not be suitable for application to PV data, as the direct use of time series data does not allow the spatial smoothing effect and the DC/AC ratio cannot be accounted for by scaling the statistical distribution. Generating synthetic GHI time series at 4-second resolution from 1-minute resolution data was achieved in Hummon et al. (2013), by fitting a fast Fourier transform to 1-second GHI data to obtain the higher frequency characteristics. However, this method requires 1-minute resolution GHI data as a basis, which is not available for this study. Apart from Hummon et al. (2013), all of the methods reviewed above downscale irradiance data from hourly resolution to minutes resolutions. To allow the training data, with its stochastic variability caused by clouds, to be used to model different times of the day and year with different underlying irradiance due to the sun position, all of the methods reviewed above build the time series via the clear sky index which is the ratio of the actual value to the clear sky value. A generalised approach for modelling PV variability would be to generate GHI using spatio-temporal irradiance models, with an irradiance separation model used to generate DNI and DHI components (e.g. (Bright and Engerer, 2019)) to model PV output. Many of the methods reviewed could be applied to model higher resolution GHI if the data was available for model training (Bright et al., 2017; Frimane et al., 2019). However, ground measured solar irradiance data for an irradiance-based method or weather variables data for a purely synthetic irradiance generation method is not publicly available at the resolution of seconds for training. This paper, therefore, proposes an alternative method using PV output data, which is collected by electricity market SCADA systems and is publicly available. Our method is developed based on those methods (Grantham et al., 2017; Polo et al., 2011) that use a statistical representation of the high-resolution training data, rather than a time series, allowing for the use of PV output data, since the spatial smoothing can be accounted for by scaling the distribution. In order to select the data for synthetic PV generation, GHI and DNI pairs should be used, since they are the most important determinants of PV output and output variability, and the correlation between them should be maintained. Of the more sophisticated methods proposed for selecting stochastic time series, many e.g. using Markov chains, have focused on either GHI or DNI and would therefore require adaption. While other more sophisticated methods improve performance by treating different sky conditions differently (Perry and Troccoli, 2016; Polo et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2018) or introducing 6 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

This paper focusses on adapting existing proven synthetic irradiance downscaling methods for use with PV output data. We, therefore, employ Grantham et al. (2017)’s relatively simple method, which importantly maintains the GHI-DNI pairs, as the basis for our approach to selecting the very short-term data. 3. Data sources 3.1. 4-second PV plant output The 4-second resolution power output of PV farms registered in the NEM is used as the very short- term reference data for this study. This data is recorded from PV plants’ SCADA system and is published by AEMO for the purpose of Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) Causer Pays calculations. The data is publicly available on AEMO’s website (AEMO, 2016). The data can be extracted using NEMOSIS which is available at (Gorman, 2018). As of 2020, there were 5.44GWAC of utility-scale PV plants registered in the NEM ranging from 20 to 300 MWAC. The model developed in this paper is based on four utility-scale PV plants which have data available for longer than one year since commissioning the full plant capacity. The data period of the four utility-scale PV plants is 24 months (2016 to 2017). One year of data is used for characterisation and the rest is used for model validation. The key characteristics of each plant and the year of data used for developing the model are as listed in Table 1. The four PV plants are situated in different climate zones even though they are all in New South Wales (NSW). These PV plants represent a range of plant size and mounting configurations that are generally found in the NEM. Their locations also cover several different climate classifications. Other plants operating in the NEM with less than one year’s data available are used for the method validation in Section 6.

Satellite-derived irradiance data Hourly satellite-derived GHI and DNI datasets from 2016 to 2018 were obtained from the Australian BoM (Bureau of Meteorology, 2018a). During the period, the satellite used was Himawari-8 with a temporal resolution of 10 minutes aggregated to hourly by BoM. The root mean square difference is 76 W/m2 for GHI and 172 W/m2 for DNI compared to ground measurement (Bureau of Meteorology, 7 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC. Keeratimahat, K., Copper, J., Bruce, A. and MacGill, I. (2021) ‘Generation of synthetic 4 s utility-scale PV output time series from hourly solar irradiance data’, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy. AIP Publishing LLC, 13(2), p. 026301. doi: 10.1063/5.0033855. 2016a, 2016b). These datasets are available at a 0.05o x 0.05o spatial resolution which is equivalent to approximately 5 x 5 km, so can be used for any location across Australia. This satellite-derived irradiance data contains inherent spatial smoothing effect however, as hourly irradiance has strong correlation over 5 x 5 km range, this should not affect our modelling. Hours where data is not available were excluded from the modelling. 3.3. Weather data Wind speed and ambient temperature data for the estimation of clear sky PV system output profiles was obtained from Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) operated by the BoM with 30-minute resolution (Bureau of Meteorology, 2018b). The data was averaged to mean hourly values, and also interpolated into 4-seconds for clear sky output modelling. 4. Methodology 4.1. Methodology concept In this paper, Grantham et al. (2017)’s approach of bootstrapping to increase temporal resolution based on GHI and DNI is used for selecting very short-term utility PV output data to model another site. Since satellite-derived GHI and DNI data are widely available across the NEM, this method can be applied within the limitations of available data, whereas some other methods require a range of weather data that is not available at the required resolution. The approach also uses information from a single source, whereas some other methods require processing of cloud images or data from surrounding locations to define sky conditions or cloud intermittency. While we are modelling PV generation, rather than irradiance, the use of GHI and DNI paired values can be used to accurately model PV output (Hummon et al., 2014), and are, therefore, appropriate to define the level of power generation and fluctuation. Furthermore, Grantham et al. validated the method across four different climate zones within Australia and showed that high-frequency data from one location can be used with hourly data from other locations, even across different climate zones. Following Grantham et al. ’s method, we bin the very short-term training data by pairs of average hourly GHI and DNI. The synthetic time series is then generated by bootstrapping the data from a bin which is selected for each hour according to the average GHI and DNI at the location to be modelled. Most studies (Bright et al., 2015; Grantham et al., 2017; Perry and Troccoli, 2016; Polo et al., 2011) have used about 10 years of data to generate the binned high-resolution datasets. However, this study only has data available over a period of 1-2 years for each of the four PV plants used for training the models. Bootstrapping from this relatively small number of hourly sets of datapoints will result in many repetitive patterns and, therefore, not be statistically representative of the PV short-term variability. Given the assumption that the short-term variability is stochastic, (Polo et al., 2011) suggest that resampling time series data from a fitted distribution is, therefore, preferable for data sets with a small number of hours available. Grantham et al. (2017) also suggest that fitting a distribution instead of direct bootstrapping is appropriate with a smaller number of observations than the 10 years used in their published paper, an approach that has been adopted here. It should be noted that using only 1-2 years of data may result in a statistical distribution that is less representative than that from a longer-term dataset. This representation can be improved in the future when more data becomes available. 8 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC. Keeratimahat, K., Copper, J., Bruce, A. and MacGill, I. (2021) ‘Generation of synthetic 4 s utility-scale PV output time series from hourly solar irradiance data’, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy. AIP Publishing LLC, 13(2), p. 026301. doi: 10.1063/5.0033855. This paper uses PV plant output as the training data set. The variability of PV plant output is impacted by a spatial smoothing effect which depends on the size and, hence, area covered by the PV plant (Perez et al., 2016). It is also impacted by clipping of the output of the PV plant at peak solar periods when the DC/AC ratio is greater than 1 and the inverters are at rated output even while greater DC power is available (Keeratimahat et al., 2019). The utility-scale PV plants providing the high-resolution data in this study exhibit both of these effects because the plants cover at least 500 m in length and the output, as measured at the grid connection point, sees inverter clipping occurring for about 2 to 3.5 hours on high output days. To accommodate these factors that impact the variability data from the reference plants, a new method has, therefore, been developed in this paper. Our method differs from Grantham et al. (2017) in two key ways. Firstly, a scaling approach of PV plant capacity is proposed to account for spatial smoothing characteristics of the training data. Secondly, due to the limited period of training data available, we follow the recommendation in Grantham et al. (2017) that is to resampling datapoints from a distribution instead of bootstrapping a series of datapoints from a bin like in Grantham et al. (2017). It is worth noting that this study will exclude the temperature effect on PV output variations. Although temperature has impacts on PV performance and can have different influences across various location, it has less of an impact on short-term variability because variation of temperature at the second to second level is small. The methodology for generating synthetic 4-second plant output time series consists of two parts: 1. Developing the variability model from the four PV plants listed in Table 1, and 2. Generating the synthetic data. 4.2. Developing the models of 4-second variability An overview of the model development is provided in Figure 1. These steps are applied to each of the four PV plants and, therefore, result in four models. For each bin, we characterise the distribution parameters of the data and apply scaling to the variability distribution to account for the effect of plant size and, hence, spatial smoothing. We then generate a set of distributions that are varied by DC size for each bin. These steps are described in more detail in Sections 4.2.1-4.2.6. 9 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC. Keeratimahat, K., Copper, J., Bruce, A. and MacGill, I.

Figure 1 A diagram of steps in constructing the model for generating scaled distribution of 4-second changes in clear sky PV output index (𝜿𝑷𝑽) 4.2.1. Calculating and binning clear sky index Following Grantham et al. ’s approach, we use clear sky index values to isolate the stochastic variability from variation caused by the position of the sun. Clear sky index (𝜅) is commonly defined as the ratio of the irradiance to the clear sky irradiance of that instance. In this study the clear sky index of GHI and DNI is denoted as 𝜅𝑔 and 𝜅𝑏 respectively. To calculate hourly clear sky index at each plant location, hourly solar irradiance (GHI and DNI) from the BoM’s gridded satellite derived irradiance data set were used (Bureau of Meteorology, 2018a), and the clear sky irradiance profiles for both GHI and DNI were computed using the Ineichen-Perez clear sky model (Ineichen and Perez, 2002), as implemented in the PVLib_toolbox (Holmgren et al., 2018) . This clear sky model was chosen because it has been shown to have good performance for estimating clear sky GHI across various locations in Australia (Engerer and Mills, 2015). However, underestimations were found (Engerer and Mills, 2015), which will result in a 𝜅𝑏 value of larger than 1 when dividing the measured data by underestimated clear sky values. This was accounted by allowing our model a maximum 𝜅𝑏 of 1.5 which is the physical limit (Killinger et al., 2017; Perry and Troccoli, 2016). As the fit of the clear sky varies according to the chosen irradiance model and location, the clear sky profile is scaled to ensure that clear sky days are accurately represented. Similar to Grantham et al. ’s approach, the clear sky index profile of days with a maximum clear sky index larger than 0.9 is divided by the maximum value of that day to scale the peak to 1. This scaling is applied to GHI and DNI separately. Hourly gridded satellite GHI and DNI (4.2.1.) Calculate clear sky index (𝜅) and convert into bin numbers (𝑁𝑔, 𝑁𝑏) (4.2.3.)

Calculating clear sky PV output index Our model is based on PV plant output data, rather than the irradiance data used to create synthetic irradiance time series in the literature. Before it can be used to model another PV plant, (i) the PV output data requires normalisation according to plant capacity (ii) the method must account for any clipping due to a high DC/AC ratio, and (iii) the data must be adjusted for the effect of spatial smoothing. We use the clear sky PV output index (𝜅𝑃𝑉) instead of the MW plant output (Perez et al., 2011), taking a similar approach to Grantham et al. (2017). This both normalises to plant capacity and separates the effect of cloud/weather from predictable output changes due to solar geometry. The clear sky PV output index (𝜅𝑃𝑉) (Engerer and Mills, 2014) is calculated by normalising the measured 4-second PV plant output from AEMO’s SCADA data according to the clear sky PV output as shown in Eq 1, 𝜅𝑃𝑉(𝑡) = 𝑃 𝐴𝐶(𝑡) 𝑃𝐴𝐶 ∗ (𝑡) , (Eq 1) where 𝑃 𝐴𝐶 is the actual generation of the plant, 𝑃𝐴𝐶 ∗ is 4-second PV system output expected under clear sky conditions and 𝜅𝑃𝑉 is the clear sky output index at timestamp 𝑡. For Eq 1, the clear sky PV output profiles of the PV plants are required. However, since the PV plant specifications are not publicly available, clear sky output cannot be modelled using standard equations for PV plant output. A simple approach to estimate clear sky output profiles is to extract the clear sky days from the plant output data and fit a 3rd order polynomial surface across the year. However, this approach is not applicable when the generation profiles are not symmetrical between morning and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11Nb Ng 11 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

Many models to detect clear sky periods have been developed (Gueymard et al., 2019) with varying input requirements but mainly zenith angle, GHI and extraterrestrial horizontal irradiance. The results from these models can then be use to select clear sky days. As our method is based on PV output data, this study instead uses the method proposed by Haghdadi et al. (2017) to estimate the clear sky PV system output profiles, and, therefore, 𝑃𝐴𝐶 ∗ . This method resolves unknown PV plant parameters such as tilt angle, orientation and system efficiency to recreate PV output profiles and clear sky PV output profiles for a particular plant. The generated clear sky output profile is then clipped at the plant’s rated AC capacity due to DC/AC ratio. Adjusting for spatial smoothing requires scaling of the statistical distribution of PV variability. Therefore, we use a measure of PV variability rather than PV output as training data for the model. The 4-second variability of clear sky PV output index is calculated for each of the four plants across the one-year data set as the difference between 4-second 𝜅𝑃𝑉 of the previous timestamp and the current timestamp, ∆𝜿𝑷𝑽(𝒕) = 𝜿𝑷𝑽(𝒕) − 𝜿𝑷𝑽(𝒕 − 𝟏), (Eq 2) where 𝑡 is the current timestamp and 𝑡 − 1 is the previous timestamp. 4.2.3. Binning variability of clear sky PV output index Each hour of variability (899 datapoints), from the full year of data, from the four reference PV plants (described in Table 1) is binned and associated with the corresponding hourly gridded satellite data according to the hourly GHI and DNI clear sky index paired values (𝑁𝑔, 𝑁𝑏) at the reference plant location. To overcome errors caused by plant output data that is affected by inverter clipping due to high DC/AC ratio, hours where the plant output is at its rated AC capacity for more than 50% of the hour are excluded from the binning. Moreover, we follow Grantham et al. (2017)’s criteria in excluding the first two hours after sunrise and the last two hours before sunset as well as night time periods, because large errors could be introduced by dividing the measured values with small clear sky output during high zenith angle periods in early morning and late afternoon hours. With this exclusion approach, the clear sky index might be overestimated for the low sun periods because cloudy periods occur more frequently at high zenith angle. Nonetheless, this overestimation should not be significant as the difference in frequency of occurrence of high okta between high zenith angle and low zenith angle is only 6% (Smith et al., 2017). Future work could explore whether improvements could be gained through the alternative approach of binning by zenith angle. The number of bins vary from plant to plant. Bins that have less than 10 hours of data are combined with the nearest bin because there are too few datapoints to confirm the distribution of variability. 4.2.4. Distribution fitting For each (𝑁𝑔, 𝑁𝑏) bin for each reference plant, all hourly sets of 4-second ∆𝜅𝑃𝑉 within the same bin are combined into one pool to form a frequency distribution. Anvari et al. (2016) found that frequency distribution characteristics of the very short-term variability of solar irradiance and PV plants can be described by a q-exponential distribution function. The probability density function (PDF) of a q- exponential distribution is, 12 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC. Keeratimahat, K., Copper, J., Bruce, A. and MacGill, I.

As expected, the distributions are different across all four PV plants even under the same (𝑁𝑔, 𝑁𝑏) pair. The distributions show an extremely high probability of small changes in 𝜅𝑃𝑉, with tails of significant changes. It is to be expected that Royalla (black) would experience the highest variability due to its smaller plant area, while the largest fixed orientation plant, Nyngan (red), would have the least variable output and the highest chance of zero fluctuations among the fixed-axis plants. However, Broken Hill (blue) appears to have a narrower range of variability compared to others. This could be due to the local weather conditions (less intermittent cloud even under the same (𝑁𝑔, 𝑁𝑏)bin compared to the other locations). For Moree (green), the only single-axis tracking plant in this study, the probability distribution is similar to Nyngan (red) even though the DC capacity of Moree is about half of the capacity of Nyngan. This could be caused by the greater contribution of DNI on single-axis tracking PV output, since change in DNI is more sensitive to moving cloud (Heslop and MacGill, 2014). When applying the q-exponential fitting to the original data, the large number of ∆𝜅𝑃𝑉 data close to zero appears to skew the fit away from the data. | ∆𝜅𝑃𝑉| less than 0.015 is, therefore, excluded before 13 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

Scaling the distributions to account for spatial smoothing Since plant characteristics, in particular the mounting configuration (fixed or tracking), plant size and DC/AC ratio, influence the variability characteristics of the plants, as discussed in Section 1 and demonstrated in Section 4.2.4, using generation data from one PV plant to model a second plant usually requires the second to have very similar specifications as the first. In order to extend the use of data from a small number of PV plants, the method developed in this paper adjusts the variability data to account for the differences in spatial smoothing effect on plants of different size. The variability distribution in each bin is recreated using a new standard deviation according to the DC capacity, which is the main determinant of spatial coverage and, therefore, the impact of spatial smoothing on variability.

Hoff and Perez validated a dispersion factor (Eq 8) based on the geometry of the plant, 𝐷 = 𝐿 𝑉∆𝑡 , (Eq 8) where 𝐿 is the length of the plant area, 𝑉 is the cloud transient speed in m/s and ∆𝑡 is the time interval in seconds. Because our variability data is the output of utility-scale PV plants and the scaled plant is assumed to have identical specifications with the existing plant, the length of the plant area 𝐿 can be proportionally scaled while 𝑉 and ∆𝑡 can be cancelled. Therefore, the fraction of the dispersion factor of a scaled plant to the dispersion factor of an existing PV plant is effectively equal to the ratio of the scaled DC capacity to the existing plant capacity: 𝑁 = 𝐷𝐶𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐷𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦, (Eq 9) where 𝑁 is the ratio of the scaled DC capacity to the reference plant capacity. This equation assumes that the additional portion is located next to the existing PV plant, and the area can be considered as an “optimum region”, defined such that the same cloud will affect systems in the area one by one, one time interval after another (Hoff and Perez, 2010). Nonetheless, Hoff and Perez (2012) found that the correlation of PV output ramps is very low even at less than 1 km distance at 20 seconds time interval. (Elsinga and van Sark, 2015) also found that distributed PV output at 1-minute resolution is uncorrelated at 0.34 km. Moreover, the correlation can also be estimated using for example, Equation (3.8) in (Perez et al., 2016). The calculated correlation for a 0.5 km distance with a high wind speed of 40 km/h at 4-second data samples will only result in correlation coefficient of 0.09. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the output of the additional portion of the scaled plant is not correlated with the original plant for our study of utility- scale PV plant at 4-second time resolution. This kind of configuration is considered as “dispersed” in Hoff and Perez (2010). Based on the assumption of uncorrelated output ramps, Eq 10 developed by Hoff and Perez for uncorrelated variability can be applied in this study. The equation quantifies the well-known effect of spatial smoothing (Perez et al., 2016) of a “scaled” plant based on variability of a reference (“0”) plant. This equation is theoretically true, assuming that the output of the additional portion of the scaled plant is not correlated with the original plant, the additional and existing plants are identical apart from scale, and plant portions of the same size exhibit the same variability, 𝜎∆𝜅𝑃𝑉 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 = 𝜎∆𝜅𝑃𝑉 0 ξ𝑁 , (Eq 10) where 𝜎∆𝜅𝑃𝑉 0 is the standard deviation of the variability of clear sky PV output index at the reference plant and 𝜎∆𝜅𝑃𝑉 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 is the standard deviation of the variability of clear sky PV output index at the scaled 16 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

The scaled standard deviation which is the new standard deviation for the size of the plant to be modelled can be used to generate a new frequency distribution for that plant size by using Eq 3 – Eq 6. Scaling is applied to the distribution before including the proportion of |∆𝜅𝑃𝑉| < 0.015. In implementing Hoff and Perez (2012)’s method here, the datapoints in |∆𝜅𝑃𝑉| < 0.015 are not scaled because while the q-exponential is a good fit for |∆𝜅𝑃𝑉| > 0.015, there is insufficient data (not enough PV plants) to confirm that scaling the q-exponential distribution can describe how these small changes in power output vary across different plant sizes. 4.2.6. Generating a new distribution A new set of distributions for the new plant size is generated for each bin of data, using the scaled distribution parameters. New distributions are regenerated with 200,000 datapoints of ∆𝜅𝑃𝑉 from a reverse q-exponential cumulative distribution function (CDF). Models are developed for each plant, based on each other plant that uses the same mounting configuration (fixed or tracking), using the one-year worth of data available for each PV plant as described in Table 1. Examples of scaling of distributions are shown in Figure 4., showing some examples of scaled and unscaled distributions from specific GHI, DNI bins from Broken Hill used to model Royalla. Figure 3 shows that the measured probability distributions of Broken Hill are significantly different to those of Royalla. Figure 4 shows an improvement in the fit after the scaling. 17 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC. Keeratimahat, K., Copper, J., Bruce, A. and MacGill, I.

Figure 5 A diagram of steps in modelling synthetic time series of 4-second power output from hourly gridded satellite GHI and DNI data at the location where only hourly data is available. 4.3.1. Inputs from the site to be modelled The site to be modelled is required to have the following inputs: 1) Hourly GHI and DNI data 2) Modelled 4-second clear sky PV output (𝑃𝐴𝐶 ∗ ) – this is calculated using clear sky solar irradiance, weather data (interpolated from 30 minutes resolution) and plant parameters such as tilt angle, azimuth and system efficiency. 3) Modelled hourly clear sky PV output (𝑃𝐴𝐶 ∗′ ) – this is calculated using hourly clear sky GHI and DNI, weather data and plant parameters. 4) Modelled hourly PV power output (𝑃𝐴𝐶 ′ ) – this is calculated using hourly GHI and DNI (from Step 1), weather data and plant parameters. If the plant parameters are unknown, they can be estimated using the method in Section 4.2.2. Note that for the validation section of this paper (Section 5), the measured hourly average of 4-second power output is used instead of modelled hourly PV output based on satellite-derived GHI and DNI (Step 4), to exclude uncertainty associated with the satellite derived GHI and DNI data and PV power output modelling, since these are not the focus of the new method presented in our paper. Modelled PV output is, however, used in the modelling section (Section 6) of the paper. (4.3.1.)

AIP Publishing LLC, 13(2), p. 026301. doi: 10.1063/5.0033855. 4.3.2. Resampling datapoints from distributions From the location to be modelled at high resolution, hourly GHI and DNI paired values are converted to (𝑁𝑔, 𝑁𝑏) which identifies the bin from which to select samples. If the exact bin is not available, the nearest bin is used. The initial value or 𝜅𝑃𝑉 ′ of the hourly interval is set to the hourly average clear sky PV output index. In order to preserve smooth generation during clear sky periods, a similar approach to that used by (Polo et al., 2011) is applied by setting a maximum threshold for the clear sky index value. For hours with (𝑁𝑔, 𝑁𝑏) greater than (11, 11), a linear adjustment is applied as shown in Eq 11, 𝜅𝑃𝑉(𝑡) = 𝜅𝑃𝑉 ′ (ℎ) + ∑ ∆𝜅𝑃𝑉(𝑡)𝑡 𝑡 = 1 + 𝑡 900 (𝜅𝑃𝑉 ′ (ℎ + 1) − 𝜅𝑃𝑉 ′ (ℎ) ), (Eq 11) where 𝜅𝑃𝑉(𝑡) is the 4-second clear sky PV output index at time t in the hourly interval ℎ, 𝜅𝑃𝑉 ′ (ℎ) + is the hourly clear sky PV output index and 𝜅𝑃𝑉 ′ (ℎ + 1) is the hourly clear sky PV output index of the next hour. For other bins, 500 sets of 899 datapoints of 4-second ∆𝑘𝑡′𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 are randomly resampled from the relevant bin. The random resampling approach is the same approach used in (Polo et al., 2011) which assumes that the short-term variability is stochastic and hence, assumes no autocorrelation. For each hour of the time series, 500 series of 4-second data are generated to create large samples. 𝜿𝑷𝑽 at each 4-second timestamp 𝑡 is calculated by Eq 12. 𝜅𝑃𝑉(𝑡) = 𝜅𝑃𝑉 ′ (ℎ) + ∑ ∆𝜅𝑃𝑉(𝑡)𝑡−1 𝑡 = 1 (Eq 12) However, this cumulative addition can result in negative 𝜅𝑃𝑉(𝑡) when the resampling set has a consecutive number of ramps down, or can also result in 𝜅𝑃𝑉(𝑡)larger than 1. Hence, sample sets with a negative value or a value larger than 1.5 are excluded from the 500 samples because these values exceed physical limits. To preserve hour to hour connection, only the series where the difference between 𝜅𝑃𝑉(900)and 𝜅𝑃𝑉 ′ (ℎ + 1)is a member of the bin are selected. 4.3.3. Calculating MW PV power output The 4-second PV power output (𝑃𝐴𝐶) (MW) can then be calculated by multiplying the synthesised time series of 4-second 𝜅𝑃𝑉 with the 𝑃𝐴𝐶 ∗ . Any output that is greater than the AC rated capacity of the PV plant is clipped at the capacity to model the behaviour of inverter clipping. 4.3.4. Selecting the series The final series for the hour is the series with the minimum difference between the hourly average of 𝑃𝐴𝐶 and the 𝑃𝐴𝐶 ′ . This iterative process is not computationally intensive even though it is modelling at 4 seconds temporal resolution. The computational time was 20 minutes with a single core on an Intel® Xeon® computer to complete the random resampling of one year time series for one PV plant. 5. Results and validation 5.1.

The fitness between the modelled and measured output results pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9958. Figure 6 A density heatmap between hourly measured PV output and hourly modelled PV output at Broken Hill modelled by the scaled distributions from Royalla (excluding nighttime). The scaled distributions from each reference plant are used to model the output of each of the plants at the 4 second level. To validate the results at the hourly level, the power output uncertainty at the hourly level resulting from the model is expressed using two statistical metrics, NMBD and NRMSD , shown in Table 2. Similarly, Table 2 also presents a comparison of daily PV output for longer term evaluation. The NMBD is normalised against total annual generation (MWh) while the NRMSD is normalised against the maximum hourly generation (MWh) as suggested in Grantham et al. (2017). For this validation, to exclude any uncertainty associated with the satellite-derived GHI and DNI values which is outside the scope of this study, and focus on the uncertainty associated with the proposed variability modelling approach, the hourly average of the 4-second measured output was used to select a time series from the generated set of time series, instead of using hourly GHI and DNI and plant specifications. As expected, low NMBDs (0.3% - 0.8%) and NRMSDs (0.00% - 0.03%) for hourly comparison demonstrate good performance in modelling power output. The daily values also imply low uncertainties. To check that the scaling step does not affect the power generation modelling, for comparison Table 2 also includes the results of using unscaled distributions to model each of the plants. Overall, as expected, the results from using scaled and unscaled distributions and the results across different Test - Model pairs are very similar for both metrics (less than 1% difference). The hourly variation is evaluated by comparing the daily standard deviations using the same uncertainty metric. Table 3 demonstrates that the hourly variation of the modelled output and measured output agree well with less than 1.6% in NMBDs for all models.

Similarity of variability The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Integral test (KSI) is used as a measure of the similarity between two distributions. This metric measures the differences between two cumulative distribution functions according to each point on the curves (Eq 13) (Grantham et al., 2017), 𝐾𝑆𝐼 = ∫ |𝐹2(𝑥)− 𝐹1(𝑥)| 𝑑𝑥 𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝛼𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 , (Eq 13) where 𝑥 is PV output variability, 𝐹(𝑥) is a cumulative distribution function of 4-second PV output variability and 𝛼𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 is calculated from a critical value 𝑉𝐶 as stated in Grantham et al. (2017). 𝛼𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 can be calculated by Eq 14 – Eq 15. 𝛼𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 = 𝑉𝐶(𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛) (Eq 14) 𝑉𝐶 = 1.63 ξ𝑁 , 𝑁 ≥ 35 (Eq 15) In this study, the KSI test is applied with a 99% confidence level to the distribution of 4-second changes in power output of the modelled compared with the measured time series. Any KSI value that is below 1 indicates that the two distributions are statistically similar. Grantham et al. (2017) noted that this test will not work with samples that are too large and Perry and Troccoli (2016) commented that their modelling results were found to be statistically different when assessed with a very large sample size. This is because the test will reject the null hypothesis that the two distributions are similar even for 25 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC. Keeratimahat, K., Copper, J., Bruce, A. and MacGill, I. (2021) ‘Generation of synthetic 4 s utility-scale PV output time series from hourly solar irradiance data’, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy. AIP Publishing LLC, 13(2), p. 026301. doi: 10.1063/5.0033855. very small differences (Srikirshan, 2015). Therefore, in this study the KSI test is applied to the data on a daily basis. This is also an appropriate timeframe to compare the distribution as we do not expect the same hour to have the same characteristic from aggregating only 900 datapoints but the overall daily statistical similarity should be retained. The resulting KSI values are shown in Figure 10 as a boxplot of all daily KSI values in a year. The figure also shows a comparison between modelling with scaled (according to Section 4.2.5.) and unscaled (i.e. the distribution of measured ∆𝜅𝑃𝑉 at the reference PV plants) distributions. Although scaling the variability distribution may result in an improved performance overall, the accuracy also depends on similarity of variability between sites but not the climate and geographical location as explained in Bright (2019). The reference site may perform well at a modelled site of a different location but the impact is not vice versa. For example, KSI values of Nyngan modelled by Royalla are better than KSI values of Royalla modelled by Nyngan. Bright (2019) also observes similar results, however, the cause of this is unknown. Nonetheless, the majority of the days have KSI values under 1 (with a maximum of 2 days out of 365 days at some sites with KSI > 1), which indicates similarity of the statistical distributions of 4-second PV output variability. When comparing between models, the scaled distributions perform better than (have a lower KSI) or similar to the unscaled distribution except for the case of Broken Hill modelled by Royalla. For Royalla modelled by Broken Hill (RY-BH), however, the scaled distributions do result in lower KSI values. 26 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

Figure 10 The daily KSI values to measure the similarity between measured and modelled distributions of 4-second time series of changes in power output at Nyngan (NG), Broken Hill (BH), Moree (MR), Royalla (RY) (Location of PV plant-Model) where “s” denotes modelling using scaled distributions and “u” denotes modelling using unscaled distributions (i.e. measured 4-second variability of the reference PV plants). To assess whether the correct level of variability is being assigned at an hourly level, the variability index (Stein et al., 2012) is used to compare the total variability in each hour of the synthetic and measured time series. Variability index (VI) is calculated according to 𝑉𝐼 = ∑ √(𝑃𝐴𝐶(𝑖)−𝑃𝐴𝐶(𝑖−1))2+∆𝑡2𝑛 𝑖=2 ∑ √(𝑃𝐴𝐶 ∗ (𝑖)−𝑃𝐴𝐶 ∗ (𝑖−1))2+∆𝑡2𝑛 𝑖=2 , (Eq 16) where n is the number of 4-second datapoints in an hour of time series (900 datapoints) and ∆𝑡 is the time interval of the data (4 seconds). The variability indices of modelled and measured variability are binned according to measured hourly average PV output of the plants (Figure 11). The measured variability index is shown in solid lines representing quantiles 1, 2 and 3 while the modelled variability 27 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

The distribution of the binned variability index has a similar shape to the distribution of the measured variability index demonstrating that this method has assigned appropriate variability at different levels of PV output.

The variability index is also calculated on a daily level to evaluate whether our method also captures the longer term effect. Figure 12 shows probability distribution comparisons of daily variability index between the modelled and measured PV variability. The modelled distributions at all PV plant locations align well with the measured distributions. 28 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

Figure 12 Probability distributions of daily variability indexes at Nyngan modelled by scaled distributions from Royalla, at Broken Hill modelled by scaled distributions from Nyngan, at Royalla modelled by scaled distributions from Broken Hill and at Moree modelled by scaled distributions from Moree (Location of PV plant-Model). We also assess the similarity of statistical distributions of 4-second PV output variability according to different sky conditions. Figure 13 shows cumulative distribution functions of 4-second changes in PV output according to clear sky, intermittent cloud and overcast conditions. It can be seen that the overall distributions of the modelled time series are well matched with the measured time series. Discrepancies are seen in the small variability range < 1-2 MW, where small modelled variability has higher probability. This could be due to the criteria in the method which forces smooth PV output when (𝑁𝑔, 𝑁𝑏) = (11,11) and the addition of |∆𝜅𝑃𝑉| < 0.015 to the distribution. As more plant data becomes available, the variability characteristics of utility PV plant could be better characterised and the distribution could instead be fitted using a generic distribution function with plant size as a parameter. However, with only three fixed-axis and one single axis plant available, we cannot generate parameters for such a generic distribution. Moreover, the probability of small variability can also be confirmed when more data is available. 29 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

Modelling of the existing PV plants in the NEM This section demonstrates the application of the methodology proposed in this study for estimating 4-second aggregate PV output variability of many utility-scale PV plants. The 20 plants are modelled individually with one of the three fixed tilt plant models randomly selected for fixed plants and Moree, the only single-axis tracking model, used for all single axis tracking plants. The modelling steps follow the method explained in Section 4.3. To generate hourly profiles of individual PV plants, plant specifications were assumed. For example, tilt angles were based on the latitude of the plant location. These 20 PV plants were fully commissioned in 2019 totalling 1.43 GWac. Single-axis tracking plants in 2019 contributed to 55% of the total number of PV plants registered in the NEM (11 out of 20). The modelled variability data was selected from hourly bins as per the method described above using 2017 gridded satellite solar resource data as 2019 was not available. Figure 14(a) shows monthly cumulative distribution functions of the aggregated modelled variability compared to the aggregated measured variability of the 20 PV plants. The period of measured data available for these plants is February 2019 to April 2019. With three months of measured data, seasonal difference cannot be confirmed. Therefore, they are compared with a full year time series that was modelled using 2017 irradiance data (with each line represents a monthly distribution). It can be observed that the modelled variability using the method proposed in this study is different from the measured variability. This could be the effect of overfitting the distributions which make the characteristics too localised as explained in (Bright, 2019). The distribution fitting method in Section 4.2.4 which excludes |∆𝜅𝑃𝑉| < 0.015 before applying the q-exponential distribution has resulted in higher probability at small variability range. This is because scaling was not applied to |∆𝜅𝑃𝑉| < 0.015 and, therefore, has resulted in overfitting of the distributions. Figure 14(b) shows an improvement in the results when using the scaled distributions that did not exclude |∆𝜅𝑃𝑉| < 0.015. It implies careful attention when training the models i.e. distribution fitting. 31 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC. Keeratimahat, K., Copper, J., Bruce, A. and MacGill, I.

From Figure 14, the largest mismatch between the cumulative distributions of the modelled and measured variability is 0.1, which occurred at the lowest levels of variability. Comparison with the measured aggregate 4-second variability distribution shows that the model describes the overall variability distribution for these three months of operation. It should be noted only one single-axis tracking PV plant was available for variability characterisation at the time of study. More single-axis tracking plants should be included to reproduce the model when the data becomes available as it is relevant for scenarios with higher ratios of single-axis tracking plants, such as the NEM. In terms of the application for power system studies, these errors at low levels of variability should not be a significant concern as they can be covered by the underlying uncertainty of energy demand in the system. Medium and large variability which results from the coincidence of uncorrelated ramps still shows a good fit with the measured data. 32 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.

Conclusion This paper presented a methodology to synthetically generate 4-second power output for utility-scale PV plants from hourly GHI and DNI data. The method aimed to exploit publicly available PV output data to capture and model the characteristics of very short-term variability of PV plants, which is important as an input for modelling PV generation for power system operation. The method was developed based on one year of data at four utility-scale PV plants in the NEM with sizes ranging from 20 MWAC to 102 MWAC and both fixed and single-axis tracking mounting technologies. The modelling involved binning the data according to clear sky index and scaling the distribution of the measured variability according to the ratio of reference and modelled plant capacities, in order to capture the spatial smoothing effect. A time series of 4-second power output was generated by randomly resampling from the scaled distribution of the corresponding clear sky condition. The validation of the method demonstrated that the model could generate 4-second power output time series with a similar level of hourly total generation to measured data from test plants. The modelled variability can also capture the characteristics of 4-second variability with the overall daily KSI values below 1. The majority of large discrepancies in the modelled variability distributions fall between 0 to 1 MW output changes. Discrepancies were found to be caused by overfitting of the training model. To improve the accuracy of this model, further work could revisit the best-fit distribution function to more accurately account for high frequency of low variability experienced with high-resolution PV output. How small variability which has extremely high probability varies across different plant size must be better understood. Otherwise, a generic distribution fitting with plant size as a variable could be applied when a greater number of PV plants become available to confirm the trend. Our proposed method used bootstrapping to generate the stochastic characteristic of short-term PV output variability. Extensions based on more advanced methods like Markov chains which would improve the auto-correlation could be tested in future work. With the method proposed in this study, the variability of aggregating utility-scale PV plants across a power network can be modelled. The model can be used to predict potential impacts of aggregated variability from growing penetration of utility-scale PV which is currently challenging because of the lack of historical data. The model can help in assessing future scenarios of high utility-scale PV penetration impacts on short-term power system operation including balancing reserves and frequency management. The results in Section 6 demonstrate that our method can model 4-second variability of 20 PV plants which are located in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and are associated with different climate zones based on the model developed from PV plants in NSW only. This method can be applied to regions where power system operators have high-resolution records of PV plant power output available. Despite some limitations, the method to synthesise high-resolution utility-scale PV output developed in this study is useful in utilising publicly available data to assist both prospective utility PV project developers and power system operators in characterising the short-term variability of new projects and overall higher PV penetrations. 33 Finalised version 1941-7012/© 2020 AIP Publishing LLC.
