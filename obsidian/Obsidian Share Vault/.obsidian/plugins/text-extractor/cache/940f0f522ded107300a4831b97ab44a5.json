{"path":"lit/lit_sources/Ecker22PsychologicalDriversMisinformation.pdf","text":"0123456789();: Misinformation — which we define as any information that turns out to be false — poses an inevitable challenge for human cognition and social interaction because it is a consequence of the fact that people frequently err and sometimes lie 1. However, this fact is insufficient to explain the rise of misinformation, and its subsequent influence on memory and decision-making, as a major challenge in the twenty-first century 2–4. Misinformation has been identified as a contributor to various con- tentious events, ranging from elections and referenda 5 to political or religious persecution6 and to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic 7. The psychology and history of misinformation can- not be fully grasped without taking into account contem- porary technology. Misinformation helped bring Roman emperors to power8, who used messages on coins as a form of mass communication9, and Nazi propaganda heavily relied on the printed press, radio and cinema 10. Today, misinformation campaigns can leverage digital infrastructure that is unparalleled in its reach. The inter- net reaches billions of individuals and enables senders to tailor persuasive messages to the specific psycho- logical profiles of individual users 11,12. Moreover, social media users’ exposure to information that challenges their worldviews can be limited when communication environments foster confirmation of previous beliefs — so-called echo chambers13,14. Although there is some controversy about echo chambers and their impact on people’s beliefs and behaviours12,15, the internet is an ideal medium for the fast spread of falsehoods at the expense of accurate information16. However, the prev- alence of misinformation cannot be attributed only to technology: conventional efforts to combat misinforma- tion have also not been as successful as hoped 2 — these include educational efforts that focus on merely convey- ing factual knowledge and corrective efforts that merely retract misinformation. For decades, science communication has relied on an information deficit model when responding to mis- information, focusing on people’s misunderstanding of, or lack of access to, facts 17. Thus, a thorough and acces- sible explanation of facts should overcome the impact of misinformation. However, the information deficit model ignores the cognitive, social and affective driv- ers of attitude formation and truth judgements 18–20. For example, some individuals deny the existence of climate change or reject vaccinations despite being aware of a scientific consensus to the contrary 21,22. This rejection of science is not the result of mere ignorance but is driven by factors such as conspiratorial mentality, fears, iden- tity expression and motivated reasoning — reasoning driven more by personal or moral values than objective evidence19,23–26.

Not only can belief in misinformation lead to poor judgements and decision-making, it also exerts a lingering influence on people’s reasoning after it has been corrected — an effect known as the continued influence effect. In this Review, we describe the cognitive, social and affective factors that lead people to form or endorse misinformed views, and the psychological barriers to knowledge revision after misinformation has been corrected, including theories of continued influence. We discuss the effectiveness of both pre-emptive (‘prebunking’) and reac- tive (‘debunking’) interventions to reduce the effects of misinformation, as well as implications for information consumers and practitioners in various areas including journalism, public health, policymaking and education. ✉e-mail: ullrich.ecker@ uwa.edu.au https://doi.org/10.1038/ s44159-021-00006-y ReVIeWS naTure revIeWS | PSychology volume 1 | January 2022 | 13 0123456789();: essential to consider the cognitive architecture and social context of individual decision makers. In this Review, we describe the cognitive, social and affective processes that make misinformation stick and leave people vulnerable to the formation of false beliefs. We review the theoretical models that have been proposed to explain misinformation’s resistance to correction. We provide guidance on countering mis- information, including educational and pre-emptive interventions, refutations and psychologically informed technological solutions. Finally, we return to the broader societal trends that have contributed to the rise of mis- information and discuss its practical implications on journalism, education and policymaking. Different types of misinformation exist — for example, misinformation that goes against scientific consensus or misinformation that contradicts simple, objectively true facts. Moreover, the term disinforma- tion is often specifically used for the subset of misinfor- mation that is spread intentionally27. More research is needed on the extent to which different types of misin- formation might be associated with differential psycho- logical impacts and barriers for revision, and to establish the extent to which people infer intentionality and how this might affect their processing of the false infor- mation. Thus, in this Review we do not draw a sharp distinction between misinformation and disinformation, or different types of misinformation. We use the term misinformation as an umbrella term referring to any information that turns out to be false and reserve the term disinformation for misinformation that is spread with intention to harm or deceive. Drivers of false beliefs The formation of false beliefs all but requires exposure to false information. However, lack of access to high-quality information is not necessarily the primary precursor to false-belief formation; a range of cognitive, social and affective factors influence the formation of false beliefs (Fig. 1). False beliefs generally arise through the same mechanisms that establish accurate beliefs28,29. When deciding what is true, people are often biased to believe in the validity of information30, and ‘go with their gut’ and intuitions instead of deliberating 31,32. For example, in March 2020, 31% of Americans agreed that COVID-19 was purposefully created and spread33, despite the absence of any credible evidence for its intentional devel- opment. People are likely to have encountered conspir- acy theories about the source of the virus multiple times, which might have contributed to this widespread belief because simply repeating a claim makes it more believ- able than presenting it only once 34,35. This illusory truth effect arises because people use peripheral cues such as familiarity (a signal that a message has been encountered before) 36, processing fluency (a signal that a message is either encoded or retrieved effortlessly) 37,38 and cohesion (a signal that the elements of a message have references in memory that are internally consistent) 39 as signals for truth, and the strength of these cues increases with repe- tition. Thus, repetition increases belief in both misinfor- mation and facts40–43. Illusory truth can persist months after first exposure 44, regardless of cognitive ability 45 and despite contradictory advice from an accurate source 46 or accurate prior knowledge 18,47. Another ‘shortcut’ for truth might involve defaulting to one’s own personal views. Overall belief in news head- lines is higher when the news headlines complement the reader’s worldview 48. Political partisanship can also contribute to false memories for made-up scandals49. However, difficulties discerning true from false news headlines can also arise from intuitive (or ‘lazy’) think- ing rather than the impact of worldviews 48. In one study, participants received questions (‘If you’re running a race and you pass the person in second place, what place are you in?’) with intuitive, but incorrect, answers (‘first place’). Participants who answered these questions cor- rectly were better able to discern fake from real headlines than participants who answered these questions incor- rectly, independently of whether the headlines aligned with their political ideology50. A link has also been reported between intuitive thinking and greater belief in COVID-19 being a hoax, and reduced adherence to public health measures 51. Similarly, allowing people to deliberate can improve their judgements. If quick evaluation of a headline is followed by an opportunity to rethink, belief in fake news — but not factual news — is reduced52. Like- wise, encouraging people to ‘think like fact checkers’ leads them to rely more on their own prior know- ledge instead of heuristics. For example, prior expo- sure to statements such as ‘Deer meat is called veal’ makes these statements seem truer than similar state- ments encountered for the first time, even when people know the truth (in this case that the correct term is venison47). However, asking people to judge whether the statement is true at initial exposure pro- tects them from subsequently accepting contradictions of well-known facts 53. The information source also provides important social cues that influence belief formation. In general, messages are more persuasive and seem more true when they come from sources perceived to be credible rather than non-credible42. People trust human information sources more if they perceive the source as attractive, powerful and similar to themselves54. These source judgements are naturally imperfect — people believe in-group members more than out-group members55, tend to weigh opinions equally regardless of the Author addresses 1School of Psychological Science, university of Western australia, Perth, Western australia, australia. 2School of Psychological Science, university of Bristol, Bristol, uK. 3Climate Change Communication research Hub, monash university, melbourne, victoria, australia. 4media and Communication Science, university of erfurt, erfurt, Germany. 5Department of Psychology and Human Development, vanderbilt university, nashville, Tn, uSa. 6Department of Psychology, Harvard university, Cambridge, ma, uSa. 7Department of Psychological Sciences, Purdue university, West lafayette, In, uSa. 8Department of educational Psychology, university of minnesota, minneapolis, mn, uSa. 9Hubbard School of Journalism and mass Communication, university of minnesota, minneapolis, mn, uSa. 10College of Communication, Boston university, Boston, ma, uSa. www.nature.com/nrpsychol Reviews 14 | January 2022 | volume 1 0123456789();: competence of those expressing them56 and overesti- mate how much their beliefs overlap with other people’s, which can lead to the perception of a false consensus57. Experts and political elites are trusted by many and have the power to shape public perceptions58,59; therefore, it can be especially damaging when leaders make false claims. For example, false claims about public health threats such as COVID-19 made by political leaders can reduce the perceived threat of the virus as well as the perceived efficacy of countermeasures, decreasing adherence to public health measures 60,61. Moreover, people often overlook, ignore, forget or confuse cues about the source of information62. For example, for online news items, a logo banner specify- ing the publisher (for example, a reputable media outlet or a dubious web page) has been found not to decrease belief in fake news or increase belief in factual news63. In the aggregate, groups of laypeople perform as well as professional fact checkers at categorizing news outlets as trustworthy, hyper-partisan or fake 64. However, when acting alone, individuals — unlike fact checkers — tend to disregard the quality of the news outlet and judge a headline’s accuracy based primarily on the plausibility of the content 63. Similarly, although people are quick to dis- trust others who share fake news 65, they frequently forget information sources 66. This tendency is concerning: even though a small number of social media accounts spread an outsized amount of misleading content67–69, if con- sumers do not remember the dubious origin, they might not discount the content accordingly. The emotional content of the information shared also affects false-belief formation. Misleading content that spreads quickly and widely (‘virally’) on the internet often contains appeals to emotion, which can increase persuasion. For example, messages that aim to generate fear of harm can successfully change attitudes, intentions and behaviours under certain conditions if recipients feel they can act effectively to avoid the harm 70. Moreover, according to a preprint that has not been peer-reviewed, ‘happy thoughts’ are more believable than neutral ones 71. People seem to understand the association between emotion and persuasion, and naturally shift towards more emotional language when attempting to convince others72. For example, anti-vaccination activists fre- quently use emotional language 73. Emotion can be per- suasive because it distracts readers from potentially more diagnostic cues, such as source credibility. In one study, participants read positive, neutral and negative headlines about the actions of specific people; social judgements about the people featured in the headlines were strongly determined by emotional valence of the headline but unaffected by trustworthiness of the news source 74. Inferences about information are also affected by one’s own emotional state. People tend to ask them- selves ‘How do I feel about this claim?’, which can lead to influences of a person’s mood on claim evaluation 75. Using feelings as information can leave people sus- ceptible to deception76, and encouraging people to ‘rely on their emotions’ increases their vulnerability to misinformation 77. Likewise, some specific emotional states such as a happy mood can make people more vul- nerable to deception78 and illusory truth79. Thus, one functional feature of a sad mood might be that it reduces gullibility 80. Anger has also been shown to promote belief in politically concordant misinformation81 as well as COVID-19 misinformation 82. Finally, social exclusion, which is likely to induce a negative mood, can increase susceptibility to conspiratorial content 83,84. In sum, the drivers of false beliefs are multifold and largely overlooked by a simple information deficit model. The drivers include cognitive factors, such as use of intuitive thinking and memory failures; social factors, such as reliance on source cues to determine truth; and affective factors, such as the influence of mood on credu- lity. Although we have focused on false-belief formation here, the psychology behind sharing misinformation is a related area of active study (Box 1). Barriers to belief revision A tacit assumption of the information deficit model is that false beliefs can easily be corrected by providing rele vant facts. However, misinformation can often continue to influence people’s thinking even after they receive a correction and accept it as true. This persistence is known as the continued influence effect (CIE) 85–88. In the typical CIE laboratory paradigm, participants are presented with a report of an event (for example, a fire) that contains a critical piece of information related to the event’s cause (‘the fire was probably caused by arson’). That information might be subsequently chal- lenged by a correction, which can take the form of a retraction (a simple negation, such as ‘it is not true that arson caused the fire’) or a refutation (a more detailed correction that explains why the misinformation was false). When reasoning about the event later (for exam- ple, responding to questions such as ‘what should author- ities do now?’), individuals often continue to rely on the critical information even after receiving — and being able to recall — a correction 89. Variants of this paradigm have used false real-world claims or urban myths90–92. Corrected misinformation can also continue to influence the amount a person is willing to pay for a consumer product or their propensity to promote a social media Cognitive drivers Socio-aﬀective drivers Intuitive thinking • Lack of analytical thinking and/or deliberation Illusory truth • Familiarity • Fluency • Cohesion Source cues • Elites • In-group • Attractive Worldview • Personal views • Partisanship Cognitive failures • Neglect source cues and/or knowledge • Forget source and/or counter-evidence Emotion • Emotive information • Emotional state False beliefs Fig. 1 | Drivers of false beliefs.

The CIE might be an influential factor in the persistence of beliefs that there is a link between vaccines and autism despite strong evidence discrediting this link 96,97 or that weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq in 2003 despite no supporting evidence98. The CIE has primarily been conceptualized as a cognitive effect, with social and affective underpinnings. Cognitive factors. Theoretical accounts of the CIE draw heavily on models of memory in which informa- tion is organized in interconnected networks and the availability of information is determined by its level of activation 99,100 (Fig. 2). When information is encoded into memory and then new information that discredits it is learned, the original information is not simply erased or replaced101. Instead, misinformation and corrective information coexist and compete for activation. For example, misinformation that a vaccine has caused an unexpectedly large number of deaths might be incorpo- rated with knowledge related to diseases, vaccinations and causes of death. A subsequent correction that the information about vaccine-caused deaths was inaccurate will also be added to memory and is likely to result in some knowledge revision. However, the misinformation will remain in memory and can potentially be reactivated and retrieved later on. One school of thought — the integration account — suggests that the CIE arises when a correction is not sufficiently encoded and integrated with the misinfor- mation in the memory network (Fig. 2a). There is robust evidence that integration of the correction and misin- formation is a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition for memory updating and knowledge revision100. This view implies that a successful revision requires detect- ing a conflict between the misinformation and the cor- rection, the co-activation of both representations in memory, and their subsequent integration102. Evidence for this account comes from the success of interven- tions that bolster conflict detection, co-activation, and integration of misinformation and correction103,104. Assuming that information integration relies on pro- cessing in working memory (the short-term store used to briefly hold and manipulate information in the ser- vice of thinking and reasoning), the finding that lower working memory capacity predicts greater susceptibility to the CIE is also in line with this account 105 (although it has not been replicated 106). This theory further assumes that as the amount of integrated correct information increases, memory for the correction becomes stronger, at the expense of memory for the misinformation102. Thus, both the interconnectedness and the amount of correct information can influence the success of memory revision. An alternative account is based on the premise that the CIE arises from selective retrieval of the misinfor- mation even when corrective information is present in memory (Fig. 2b). For example, it has been proposed that a retraction causes the misinformation representa- tion to be tagged as false 107. The misinformation can be retrieved without the false tag, but the false tag cannot be retrieved without concurrent retrieval of the mis- information. One instantiation of this selective-retrieval view appeals to a dual-process mechanism, which assumes that retrieval can occur based on an automatic, effortless process signalling information familiarity (‘I think I have heard this before’) or a more strategic, effortful process of recollection that includes contextual detail (‘I read about this in yesterday’s newspaper’)108. According to this account of continued influence, the CIE can arise if there is automatic, familiarity-driven retrieval of the misinformation (for example, in response to a cue), without explicit recollection of the corrective information and associated post-retrieval suppression of the misinformation 107,109. Evidence for this account comes from studies demonstrating that the CIE increases as a function of factors associated with increased familiarity (such as repetition)107 and reduced recollection (such as advanced participant age and longer study-test delays) 92. Neuroimaging studies have suggested that activity during retrieval, when participants answer inference questions about an encoded event — but not when the correction is encoded — is associated with continued reliance on corrected misinformation110,111. This pre- liminary neuroimaging evidence generally supports the selective-retrieval account of the CIE, although it Box 1 | Why people share misinformation online misinformation transmission involves both a receiver (the person encountering the misinformation) and a sender (the person making or sharing the misinformation). Thus, it is crucial to consider why people share misinformation with others. on social media, sharing is often dictated by what captures attention. moral-emotional words such as ‘fight’, ‘greed’, ‘evil’ and ‘punish’ are prioritized in early visual attention over other arousing words 276 and also lead to increased sharing. For example, adding a single moral-emotional word to tweets about contentious political issues such as gun control increases retweets by 20% 277. an angry mood can also boost misinformation sharing 82. Because social media algorithms promote content that is likely to be shared, the interplay of psychological tendencies and technological optimization can thus easily lead to viral spread of misinformation online. ‘lazy’ or intuitive thinking can also lead people to share content that they might recognize as false if they thought about it more. accordingly, asking people to explain how they know that news headlines are true or false reduces sharing of false political headlines 278, and brief accuracy nudges — simple interventions that prompt people to consider the accuracy of the information they encounter or share — can reduce sharing of false news about politics 207 and CovID-19 (reF. 279). These studies suggest that to the extent that people pay attention to accuracy, they are likely to share things they genuinely believe. most people report that they would need to be paid to share false news; even when stories favour their political views, they worry about possible reputation costs from sharing false news 65. Those reputation costs are real — over half of social media users report that they have stopped following someone who posted ‘made-up news and information’ 280. If a person’s focus is not on information veracity, they might share misinformation for other reasons 201. Indeed, 14% of respondents in a 2016 uS survey admitted to knowingly sharing false news 281. There are some innocuous reasons to intentionally spread falsehoods; for example, it is tempting to share information that would be ‘interesting (or consequential) if true’ 282. likewise, findings from a preprint that has not been peer-reviewed suggest that people might share positive but questionable claims that could make others feel better, such as ‘a cat saved a woman’s life by scaring off a bear trying to attack her’ 71. There are also self-serving motives for sharing, such as to signal group membership 283 or for self-promotion 260. Finally, some people share misinformation to fuel moral outrage in others 277,284. one non-peer reviewed preprint suggests that some people share hostile political rumours and conspiracy theories to incite chaos; this desire to ‘watch the world burn’ is even stronger following social exclusion 285. With these alternative goals in mind, the viral nature of misinformation does not occur despite its low veracity but because of its ability to fulfil other psychological needs 11. www.nature.com/nrpsychol Reviews 16 | January 2022 | volume 1 0123456789();: suggests that the CIE is driven by misinformation recol- lection rather than misinformation familiarity, which is at odds with the dual-process interpretation. Both of these complementary theoretical accounts of the CIE can explain the superiority of detailed refu- tations over retractions92,112,113. Provision of additional corrective information can strengthen the activation of correct information in memory or provide more detail to support recollection of the correction 89,103, which makes a factual correction more enduring than the misinfor- mation90. Because a simple retraction will create a gap in a person’s mental model, especially in situations that require a causal explanation (for example, a fire must be caused by something), a refutation that can fill in details of a causal, plausible, simple and memorable alternative explanation will reduce subsequent recall of the retracted misinformation. Social and affective factors. These cognitive accounts do not explicitly consider the influence of social and affec- tive mechanisms on the CIE. One socio-affective factor is source credibility, the perceived trustworthiness and expertise of the sources providing the misinformation and correction. Although source credibility has been to found to exert little influence on acceptance of mis- information if the source is a media outlet63,114, there is generally strong evidence that credibility has signif- icant impact on acceptance of misinformation from non-media sources 42,88,115. The credibility of a correction source also matters for (post-correction) misinformation reliance 116, although perhaps less than the credibility of the misinformation source 88. The effectiveness of factual corrections might depend on perceived trustworthiness rather than per- ceived expertise of the correction source 117,118, although perceived expertise might matter more in science-related contexts, such as health misinformation 119,120. It can also be quite rational to discount a correction if the cor- rection source is low in credibility121,122. Further com- plicating matters, the perceived credibility of a source varies across recipients. In extreme cases, people with strong conspiratorial ideation tendencies might mistrust any official source (for example, health authorities) 19,26. More commonly, people tend to trust sources that are perceived to share their values and worldviews 54,55. A second key socio-affective factor is worldview — a person’s values and belief system that grounds their personal and sociocultural identity. Corrections attacking a person’s worldview can be ineffective123 or backfire25,124. Such corrections can be experienced as attacking one’s identity, resulting in a chain reaction of appraisals and emotional responses that hinder information revision19,125. For example, if a message is appraised as an identity threat (for example, a correction that the risks of a vaccine do not outweigh the risks of a disease might be perceived as an identity threat by a person identifying as an anti-vaxxer), this can lead to intense negative emotions that motivate strategies such Myth not retrieved as false Only myth retrieved a Correction not integrated b Selective retrieval Correction not linked to myth Correction Myth Myth retrieved owing to high myth familiarity or failed recollection of correction Myth Correction Fig. 2 | Integration and retrieval accounts of continued influence. a | Integration account of continued influence. The correction had the representational strength to compete with or even dominate the misinformation (‘myth’) but was not integrated into the relevant mental model. Depending on the available retrieval cues, this lack of integration can lead to unchecked misinformation retrieval and reliance. b | Retrieval account of continued influence. Integration has taken place but the myth is represented in memory more strongly, and thus dominates the corrective information in the competition for activation and retrieval. Note that the two situations are not mutually exclusive: avoiding continued influence might require both successful integration and retrieval of the corrective information. naTure revIeWS | PSychology Reviews volume 1 | January 2022 | 17 0123456789();: as discrediting the source of the correction, ignoring the worldview-inconsistent evidence or selectively focus- ing on worldview-bolstering evidence24,126. However, how a person’s worldview influences misinformation corrections is still hotly debated (Box 2), and there is a developing consensus that even worldview-inconsistent corrections typically have some beneficial impact 91,127–131. The third socio-affective factor that influences the CIE is emotion. One study found that corrections can produce psychological discomfort that motivates a per- son to disregard the correction to reduce the feeling of discomfort132. Misinformation conveying negative emotions such as fear or anger might be particularly likely to evoke a CIE133,134. This influence might be due to a general negativity bias11,135 or more specific emo- tional influences. For example, misinformation damag- ing the reputation of a political candidate might spark outrage or contempt, which might promote continued influence of this misinformation (in particular among non-supporters)134. However, there seems to be little continued influence of negative misinformation on impression formation when the person subjected to the false allegation is not a disliked politician, perhaps because reliance on corrected misinformation might be seen as biased or judgemental (that is, it might be frowned upon to judge another person even though allegations have been proven false) 136. Other studies have compared emotive and non- emotive events — for example, a plane crash falsely assumed to have been caused by a terror attack, resulting in many fatalities, versus a technical fault, resulting in zero fatalities — and found no impact of misinformation emotiveness on the magnitude of the CIE 137. Moreover, just as a sad mood can protect against initial misinforma- tion belief 80, it also seems to facilitate knowledge revision when a correction is encountered 138. People who exhibit both subclinical depression and rumination tendencies have even been shown to exhibit particularly efficient correction of negative misinformation relative to control individuals, presumably because the salience of negative misinformation to this group facilitates revision 139. Finally, there is evidence that corrections can also benefit from emotional recalibration. For example, when misinformation downplays a risk or threat (for example, misinformation that a serious disease is relatively harm- less), corrections that provide a more accurate risk eval- uation operate partly through their impact on emotions such as hope, anger and fear. This emotional mechanism might help correction recipients realign their under- standing of the situation with reality (for example, to realize they have underestimated the real threat)113,140. Likewise, countering disinformation that seeks to fuel fear or anger can benefit from a downward adjustment of emotional arousal; for example, refutations of vaccine misinformation can reduce anti-vaccination attitudes by mitigating misinformation-induced anger 141. Interventions to combat misinformation As discussed in the preceding section, interventions to combat misinformation must overcome various cogni- tive, social and affective barriers. The most common type of correction is a fact-based correction that directly addresses inaccuracies in the misinformation and pro- vides accurate information90,102,112,142 (Fig. 3). A second approach is to address the logical fallacies common in some types of disinformation — for example, corrections that highlight inherently contradictory claims such as ‘global temperature cannot be measured accurately’ and ‘temperature records show it has been cooling’ (Fig. 4). Such logic-based corrections might offer broader pro- tection against different types of misinformation that use the same fallacies and misleading tactics 21,143. A third approach is to undermine the plausibility of the mis- information or the credibility of its source144. Multiple approaches can be combined into a single correction — for example, highlighting both the factual and logical inaccuracies in the misinformation or undermining source credibility and underscoring factual errors94,95,145. However, most research to date has considered each approach separately and more research is required to test synergies between these strategies. More generally, two strategies that can be distin- guished are pre-emptive intervention (prebunking) and reactive intervention (debunking). Prebunking seeks to help people recognize and resist subsequently encoun- tered misinformation, even if it is novel. Debunking Box 2 | The elusive backfire effects There have been concerns that corrective interventions might cause harm by inadvertently strengthening misconceptions and ironically enhancing reliance on the very misinformation that is being corrected. However, these concerns are largely overstated. Specifically, three types of ostensible ‘backfire effects’ have been discussed: the overkill backfire effect, the familiarity backfire effect, and the worldview backfire effect 89. only one study has investigated the potential overkill backfire effect, thought to result from a correction using too many counterarguments. This study found that corrections of dubious claims were more (rather than less) potent when more counterarguments were used, so long as those counterarguments were relevant 286. Thus, the overkill backfire effect does not have empirical support. The familiarity backfire effect is thought to result from a correction that unintentionally boosts the familiarity of the misinformation being corrected. This effect is character- ized as an increase in misinformation belief following a correction, relative to a pre-correction baseline or no-exposure control condition. There are some findings that repeating corrections might lead to a tendency to recall false claims as true, especially after a 3-day delay or in older adults (age 70+ years) 287. likewise, it has been argued that presenting ‘myths versus facts’ flyers that repeat to-be-debunked misinformation when correcting it could lead to familiarity backfire effects after a mere 30 min 288. However, these findings have not been replicated 107,289 or remain unpublished. other putative familiarity backfire effects did not compare the backfire condition with a proper base- line (for reviews see 92,256). Strong evidence against familiarity backfire comes from find- ings that explicit reminders of misinformation enhance the effect of corrections 104,290. although some researchers have argued that familiarity backfire might occur when a correction spreads novel misinformation to new audiences 185, only one study has found support for this claim (and only in one of two experiments) 291, with other studies finding no evidence 112,151,222. other demonstrations of familiarity backfire effects in the context of vaccine misinformation might be driven by worldview rather than familiarity 292. In sum, misinformation familiarity contributes to the CIe but does not typically produce backfire effects. The backfire effect of greatest concern is arguably the worldview backfire effect, thought to arise when people dismiss and counterargue against corrections of false beliefs that are central to their identity 126,293. early demonstrations of worldview backfire effects 124,294,295 drew much attention from the academy and beyond, but have proven difficult to replicate 81,128,130, partially due to unreliable methods 256,296. although findings of worldview backfire effects continue to be reported occasionally 25,297, overall the potential threat of worldview backfire effects seems limited and should not generally discourage debunking. www.nature.com/nrpsychol Reviews 18 | January 2022 | volume 1 0123456789();: emphasizes responding to specific misinformation after exposure to demonstrate why it is false. The effective- ness of these corrections is influenced by a range of fac- tors, and there are mixed results regarding their relative efficacy. For example, in the case of anti-vaccination conspiracy theories, prebunking has been found to be more effective than debunking 146. However, other studies have found debunking to outperform prebunking 87,95,142. Reconciling these findings might require considering both the specific type of correction and its placement in time. For example, when refuting climate misinforma- tion, one study found that fact-based debunking out- performed fact-based prebunking, whereas logic-based prebunking and debunking were equally effective 147. Some interventions, particularly those in online con- texts, are hybrid or borderline cases. For example, if a misleading social media post is tagged with ‘false’ 148 and appears alongside a comment with a corrective expla- nation, this might count as both prebunking (owing to the tag, which is likely to have been processed before the post) and debunking (owing to the comment, which is likely to have been processed after the post). Prebunking interventions. The simplest prebunk- ing interventions involve presenting factually correct information149,150, a pre-emptive correction142,151 or a generic misinformation warning99,148,152,153 before the misinformation. More sophisticated interventions draw on inoculation theory, a framework for pre-emptive interventions 154–156. This theory applies the principle of vaccination to knowledge, positing that ‘inoculating’ people with a weakened form of persuasion can build immunity against subsequent persuasive arguments by engaging people’s critical-thinking skills (Fig. 5). An inoculation intervention combines two elements. The first element is warning recipients of the threat of misleading persuasion. For example, a person could be warned that many claims about climate change are false Barrier to belief updating Strategy to overcome barrier Example correction Need for causal explanation Lack of integration, forgetting Misinformation familiarity • Plausible alternative explanation • Salient correction, explicit reminder of misinformation • Plausible alternative explanation • Detailed factual refutation • Pre-exposure warning • Detailed factual refutation ‘Initial suspicions were wrong: it is not true that the wildﬁre was caused by arson — it was caused by lightning strike.’ ‘Initial suspicions were wrong: it is not true that the wildﬁre was caused by arson — it was caused by lightning strike.

Naturally, even if we cannot eliminate risks altogether, we choose the lesser risk wherever possible. For example, most people would jump into their car to escape a wildﬁre, even though the risk of a fatal car crash cannot be ruled out. Likewise, for most people, the risks associated with a COVID infection are much higher than the risk associated with a vaccination.’ Fig. 3 | Barriers to belief updating and strategies to overcome them (part 1).

The second element is identifying the techniques used to mislead or the falla- cies that underlie the false arguments to refute forthcom- ing misinformation 157,158. For example, a person might be taught that techniques used to mislead include selective use (‘cherry-picking’) of data (for example, only show- ing temperatures from outlier years to create the illu- sion that global temperatures have dropped) or the use of fake experts (for example, scientists with no expertise in climate science). Understanding how those mislead- ing persuasive techniques are applied equips a person with the cognitive tools to ward off analogous persuasion attempts in the future. Because one element of inoculation is highlighting misleading argumentation techniques, its effects can generalize across topics, providing an ‘umbrella’ of protection159,160. For example, an inoculation against a misleading persuasive technique used to cast doubt on science demonstrating harm from tobacco was found to convey resistance against the same technique when used to cast doubt on climate science143. Moreover, inocu- lated people are more likely to talk about the target issue than non-inoculated people, an outcome referred to as post-inoculation talk161. Post-inoculation talk is more likely to be negative than talk among non-inoculated people, which promotes misinformation resistance both Strategy to overcome barrier Example correction Logical fallacies Poor comprehension and/or counterarguing tendencies False consensus eﬀect Example misinformation: ‘Global temperatures have dropped — the Earth is cooling’ • Consensus messaging • Social norming ‘More than 97% of climate scientists agree that global warming is happening and is human-caused. Recent surveys show that two-thirds of US voters think their country should do more to address global warming.’ ‘Scientiﬁc organizations such as the National Academies of Science from 80 countries have all aﬃrmed that human-caused global warming is happening. By contrast, sources arguing that global warming is not happening typically have no climate science expertise but do have vested interests — for example, they are funded by the fossil-fuel industry.’ ‘Economic considerations are important when discussing the impacts of climate change. Ignoring the expert consensus that human activities are causing global warming will have substantial negative impacts on the economy long-term. Taking action on climate will reduce economic risks and will create many new business opportunities.’ Perceived credibility of misinformation source • Trustworthy correction source • Undermine misinformation credibility Threat to worldview and/or identity • Identity-aﬃrming framing • Worldview-consonant framing Strategy to overcome barrier Example correction • Logic-based correction • Graphical presentation ‘Pointing out a slight drop in global temperatures over a short period is cherry-picking data to make a misleading point.

Inoculation theory has also been used to explain how strategies designed to increase information literacy and media literacy could reduce the effects of misinforma- tion. Information literacy — the ability to effectively find, understand, evaluate and use information — has been linked to the ability to detect misleading news 163 and reduced sharing of misinformation164. Generally, information literacy and media literacy (which focuses on knowledge and skills for the reception and dissemina- tion of information through the media) interventions are designed to improve critical thinking165 and the appli- cation of such interventions to spaces containing many different types of information might help people identify misinformation 166. One successful intervention focused on lateral reading — consulting external sources to examine the origins and plausibility of a piece of information, or the credibility of an information source 115,167,168. A sepa- rate non-peer-reviewed preprint suggests that focusing on telltale signs of online misinformation (including lexical cues, message simplicity and blatant use of emo- tion) can help people identify fake news169. However, research to date suggests that literacy interventions do not always mitigate the effects of misinformation 170–173. Whereas most work has used relatively passive ino- culation and literacy interventions, applications that engage people more actively have shown promise — specifically, app-based or web-based games 174–177. More work is needed to consider what types of literacy inter- ventions are most effective for conferring resistance to different types of misinformation in the contemporary media and information landscape 178. In sum, the prebunking approach provides a great tool to act pre-emptively and help people build resis- tance to misinformation in a relatively general manner. However, the advantage of generalizability can also be a weakness, because it is often specific pieces of misinformation that cause concern, which call for more specific responses. Debunking interventions. Whereas pre-emptive inter- ventions can equip people to recognize and resist mis- information, reactive interventions retrospectively target concrete instances of misinformation. For example, if a novel falsehood that a vaccine can lead to life-threatening side effects in pregnant women begins to spread, then this misinformation must be addressed using specific counter-evidence. Research broadly finds that direct corrections are effective in reducing — although fre- quently not eliminating — reliance on the misinforma- tion in a person’s reasoning 86,87. The beneficial effects of debunking can last several weeks92,100,179, although the effects can wear off quicker 145. There is also evidence that corrections that reduce misinformation belief can have downstream effects on behaviours or intentions 94,95,180,181 — such as a person’s inclination to share a social media post or their voting intentions — but not always 91,96,182. Numerous best practices for debunking have emerged90,145,183. First, the most important element of a debunking correction is to provide a factual account that ideally includes an alternative explanation for why something happened 85,86,99,102,184. For example, if a fire was thought to have been caused by negligence, then pro- viding a causal alternative (‘there is evidence for arson’) is more effective than a retraction (‘there was no negli- gence’). In general, more detailed refutations work better than plain retractions that do not provide any detail on why the misinformation is incorrect 92,100,112,113. It can be beneficial to lead with the correction rather than repeat the misinformation to prioritize the correct information and set a factual frame for the issue. However, a preprint that has not been peer-reviewed suggests that leading with the misinformation can be just as, or even more, effective if no pithy fact is available 150. Second, the misinformation should be repeated to demonstrate how it is incorrect and to make the cor- rection salient. However, the misinformation should be prefaced with a warning99,148 and repeated only once in order not to boost its familiarity unnecessarily104. It is also good to conclude by repeating and emphasizing the accurate information to reinforce the correction 185. Third, even though credibility matters less for correction sources compared with misinformation sources 88, corrections are ideally delivered by or associ- ated with high-credibility sources116–120,186. There is also emerging evidence that corrections are more impactful when they come from a socially connected source (for example, a connection on social media) rather than a stranger 187. Fourth, corrections should be paired with relevant social norms, including injunctive norms (‘protecting the vulnerable by getting vaccinated is the right thing to do’) and descriptive norms (‘over 90% of parents are vac- cinating their children’)188, as well as expert consensus (‘doctors and medical societies around the world agree that vaccinations are important and safe’)189–192. One study found a benefit to knowledge revision if corrective evidence was endorsed by many others on social media, thus giving the impression of normative backing 193. Exposure to a weakened form of misinformation... ...builds immunity against later misinformation• Neutralized misinformation • Immunity across topics • Post-inoculation talk Immunity Warning of risk of being misled Pre-emptive refutations • Fact-based • Logic-based • Source-based Myth Myth Myth Fig. 5 | Inoculation theory applied to misinformation. ‘Inoculation’ treatment can help people prepare for subsequent misinformation exposure. Treatment typically highlights the risks of being misled, alongside a pre-emptive refutation. The refutation can be fact-based, logic-based or source-based. Inoculation has been shown to increase misinformation detection and facilitate counterarguing and dismissal of false claims, effectively neutralizing misinformation. Additionally, inoculation can build immunity across topics and increase the likelihood of people talking about the issue targeted by the refutation (post-inoculation talk). naTure revIeWS | PSychology Reviews volume 1 | January 2022 | 21 0123456789();: Fifth, the language used in a correction is important. Simple language and informative graphics can facilitate knowledge revision, especially if fact comprehension might be otherwise difficult or if the person receiving the correction has a strong tendency to counterargue 194–197. When speaking directly to misinformed individuals, empathic communication should be used rather than wielding expertise to argue directives 198,199. Finally, it has been suggested that worldview- threatening corrections can be made more palatable by concurrently providing an identity affirmation 145,200,201. Identity affirmations involve a message or task (for example, writing a brief essay about one’s strengths and values) that highlights important sources of self-worth. These exercises are assumed to protect and strengthen the correction recipient’s self-esteem and the value of their identity, thereby reducing the threat associated with the correction and associated processing biases. However, evidence for the utility of identity affirmations in the context of misinformation corrections is mixed 194, so firm recommendations cannot yet be made. In sum, debunking is a valuable tool to address spe- cific pieces of misinformation and largely reduces mis- information belief. However, debunking will not eliminate the influence of misinformation on people’s reasoning at a group level. Furthermore, even well-designed debunk- ing interventions might not have long-lasting effects, thus requiring repeated intervention. Corrections on social media. Misinformation corrections might be especially important in social media contexts because they can reduce false beliefs not just in the tar- get of the correction but among everyone that sees the correction — a process termed observational correc- tion119. Best practices for corrections on social media echo many best practices offline 112, but also include link- ing to expert sources and correcting quickly and early 202. There is emerging evidence that online corrections can work both pre-emptively and reactively, although this might depend on the type of correction 147. Notably, social media corrections are more effective when they are specific to an individual piece of content rather than a generalized warning 148. Social media cor- rections are effective when they come from algorithmic sources 203, from expert organizations such as a govern- ment health agency 119,204,205 or from multiple other users on social media 206. However, particular care must be taken to avoid ostracizing people when correcting them online. To prevent potential adverse effects on people’s online behaviour, such as sharing of misleading content, gen- tle accuracy nudges that prompt people to consider the accuracy of the information they encounter or highlight the importance of sharing only true information might be preferable to public corrections that might be experienced as embarrassing or confrontational 181,207. In sum, social media users should be aware that cor- rections can be effective in this arena and have the poten- tial to reduce false beliefs in people they are connected with as well as bystanders. By contrast, confronting strangers is less likely to be effective. Given the effec- tiveness of algorithmic corrections, social media com- panies and regulators should promote implementation and evaluation of technical solutions to misinformation on social media. Practical implications Even if optimal prebunking or debunking interventions are deployed, no intervention can be fully effective or reach everyone with the false belief. The contemporary information landscape brings particular challenges: the internet and social media have enabled an exponential increase in misinformation spread and targeting to pre- cise audiences 14,16,208,209. Against this backdrop, the psycho- logical factors discussed in this Review have implications for practitioners in various fields — journalists, legisla- tors, public health officials and healthcare workers — as well as information consumers. Implications for practitioners. Combatting misinforma- tion involves a range of decisions regarding the optimal approach (Fig. 6). When preparing to counter misinforma- tion, it is important to identify likely sources. Although social media is an important misinformation vector 210, traditional news organizations can promote misinforma- tion via opinion pieces 211, sponsored content 212 or uncrit- ical repetition of politician statements 213. Practitioners must anticipate the misinformation themes and ensure suitable fact-based alternative accounts are available for either prebunking or a quick debunking response. Organizations such as the International Fact-Checking Network or the World Health Organization often form coalitions in the pursuit of this endeavour 214. Practitioners must be aware that simple retractions will be insufficient to mitigate the impact of misinfor- mation, and that the effects of interventions tend to wear off over time 92,145,152. If possible, practitioners must there- fore be prepared to act repeatedly 179. Creating engaging, fact-based narratives can provide a foundation for effec- tive correction 215,216. However, a narrative format is not a necessary ingredient 140,217, and anecdotes and stories can also be misleading 218. Practitioners can also help audiences discriminate between facts and opinion, which is a teachable skill 170,219. Whereas most news consumers do not notice or under- stand content labels forewarning that an article is news, opinion or advertising220,221, more prominent labelling can nudge readers to adjust their comprehension and interpretation accordingly. For example, labelling can lead readers to be more sceptical of promoted content 220. However, even when forewarnings are understood, they do not reliably eliminate the content’s influence 99,153. If pre-emptive correction is not possible or inef- fective, practitioners should take a reactive approach. However, not every piece of misinformation needs to be a target for correction. Due to resource limitations and opportunity costs, corrections should focus on mis- information that circulates among a substantive portion of the population and carries potential for harm183. Corrections do not generally increase false beliefs among individuals who were previously unfamiliar with the misinformation 222. However, if the risk of harm is min- imal, there is no need to debunk misinformation that few people are aware of, which could potentially raise the profile of its source. www.nature.com/nrpsychol Reviews 22 | January 2022 | volume 1 0123456789();: Implications for information consumers. Information consumers also have a role to play in combatting mis- information by avoiding contributing to its spread. For instance, people must be aware that they might encoun- ter not only relatively harmless misinformation, such as reporting errors, outdated information and satire, but also disinformation campaigns designed to instil fear or doubt, discredit individuals, and sow division2,26,223,224. People must also recognize that disinformation can be psychologically targeted through profit-driven exploita- tion of personal data and social media algorithms12. Thoughtless sharing can amplify misinformation that might confuse and deceive others. Sharing misinforma- tion can also contribute to the financial rewards sought by misinformation producers, and deepen ideological divides that disenfranchise voters, encourage violence and, ultimately, harm democratic processes 2,170,223,225,226. Thus, while engaged with content, individuals should slow down, think about why they are engaging and interrogate their visceral response. People who thoughtfully seek accurate information are more likely to successfully avoid misinformation compared with people who are motivated to find evidence to confirm their pre-existing beliefs 50,227,228. Attending to the source and considering its credibility and motivation, along with lateral reading strategies, also increase the likeli- hood of identifying misinformation115,167,171. Given the benefits of persuading onlookers through observational correction, everyone should be encouraged to civilly, carefully and thoughtfully correct online misinforma- tion where they encounter it (unless they deem it a harmless fringe view)119,206. All of these recommenda- tions are also fundamental principles of media literacy 166. Indeed, a theoretical underpinning of media literacy is that understanding the aims of media protects indi- viduals from some adverse effects of being exposed to information through the media, including the pressure to adopt particular beliefs or behaviours 170. If myth has traction or misdirection is expected If myth is not widespread Continue monitoring, withhold debunking, but prepare for quick response if myth escalates Prebunking Prebunking can take the form of: • Factual explanation • Pre-emptive warning • Generic warning • Inoculation • Information and media-literacy interventions ReactivePre-emptive Debunking Myth can be shown ﬁrst in some contexts Fact • Plausible alternative causal explanation • Details better than simple retractions Fallacy • Explain myth’s fallacy/rhetorical technique Fact • Repeat, reinforce factual explanation Myth • Preface with a warning Deploy correction Prepare fact-based alternative accounts Anticipate misinformation themes Identify likely sources of misinformation • Traditional news • Sponsored content • Social media • Politicians Fig. 6 | Strategies to counter misinformation. Different strategies for countering misinformation are available to practi- tioners at different time points. If no misinformation is circulating but there is potential for it to emerge in the future, prac- titioners can consider possible misinformation sources and anticipate misinformation themes. Based on this assessment, practitioners can prepare fact-based alternative accounts, and either continue monitoring the situation while preparing for a quick response, or deploy pre-emptive (prebunking) or reactive (debunking) interventions, depending on the traction of the misinformation. Prebunking can take various forms, from simple warnings to more involved literacy interventions. Debunking can start either with a pithy counterfact that recipients ought to remember or with dismissal of the core ‘myth’. Debunking should provide a plausible alternative cause for an event or factual details, preface the misinformation with a warning and explain any logical fallacies or persuasive techniques used to promote the misinformation. Debunking should end with a factual statement. naTure revIeWS | PSychology Reviews volume 1 | January 2022 | 23 0123456789();: Implications for policymakers. Ultimately, even if prac- titioners and information consumers apply all of these strategies to reduce the impact of misinformation, their efforts will be stymied if media platforms continue to amplify misinformation14,16,208–213. These platforms include social media platforms such as YouTube, which are geared towards maximizing engagement even if this means promoting misinformation229, and traditional media outlets such as television news channels, where misinformation can negatively impact audiences. For example, two non-peer-reviewed preprints have found that COVID-19 misinformation on Fox News was caus- ally associated with reduced adherence to public health measures and a larger number of COVID-19 cases and deaths230,231. It is, therefore, important to scrutinize whether the practices and algorithms of media platforms are optimized to promote misinformation or truth. In this space, policymakers should consider enhanced regulation. These regulations might include penalties for creating and disseminating disinformation where intentionality and harm can be established, and man- dating platforms to be more proactive, transparent and effective in their dealings with misinformation. With regards to social media specifically, companies should be encouraged to ban repeat offenders from their platforms, and to generally make engagement with and sharing of low-quality content more difficult12,232–235. Regulation must not result in censorship, and proponents of free- dom of speech might disagree with attempts to regulate content. However, freedom of speech does not include the right to amplification of that speech. Furthermore, being unknowingly subjected to disinformation can be seen as a manipulative attack on freedom of choice and the right to be well informed 236. These concerns must be balanced. A detailed summary of potential regulatory interventions can be found elsewhere 237,238. Other strategies have the potential to reduce the impact of misinformation without regulation of media content. Undue concentration of ownership and control of both social and traditional media facilitate the dis- semination of misinformation 239. Thus, policymakers are advised to support a diverse media landscape and ade- quately fund independent public broadcasters. Perhaps the most important approach to slowing the spread of misinformation is substantial investment in education, par ticularly to build information literacy skills in schools and beyond240–243. Another tool in the policymaker’s arsenal is interventions targeted more directly at behaviour, such as nudging policies and public pledges to honour the truth (also known as self-nudging) for policymakers and consumers alike 12,244,245. Overall, solutions to misinformation spread must be multipronged and target both the supply (for example, more efficient fact-checking and changes to platform algorithms and policies) and the consumption (for example, accuracy nudges and enhanced media literacy) of misinformation. Individually, each intervention might only incrementally reduce the spread of misinformation, but one preprint that has not been peer-reviewed suggests that combinations of interventions can have a substantial impact 246. More broadly speaking, any intervention to strengthen public trust in science, journalism, and democratic institutions is an intervention against the impacts of misinformation 247,248. Such interventions might include enhancing transparency in science249,250 and journal- ism 251, more rigorous fact-checking of political advertise- ments 252, and reducing the social inequality that breeds distrust in experts and contributes to vulnerability to misinformation 253,254. Summary and future directions Psychological research has built solid foundational knowledge of how people decide what is true and false, form beliefs, process corrections, and might continue to be influenced by misinformation even after it has been corrected. However, much work remains to fully understand the psychology of misinformation. First, in line with general trends in psychology and elsewhere, research methods in the field of misinforma- tion should be improved. Researchers should rely less on small-scale studies conducted in the laboratory or a small number of online platforms, often on non-representative (and primarily US-based) participants255. Researchers should also avoid relying on one-item questions with relatively low reliability256. Given the well-known attitude–behaviour gap — that attitude change does not readily translate into behavioural effects — researchers should also attempt to use more behavioural measures, such as information-sharing measures, rather than relying exclusively on self-report questionnaires93–95. Although existing research has yielded valuable insights into how people generally process misinformation (many of which will translate across different contexts and cultures), an increased focus on diversification of samples and more robust methods is likely to provide a better appreciation of important contextual factors and nuanced cultural differences 7,82,205,257–263. Second, most existing work has focused on explicit misinformation and text-based materials. Thus, the cognitive impacts of other types of misinformation, including subtler types of misdirection such as paltering (misleading while technically saying the truth)95,264–266, doctored images267, deepfake videos268 and extreme patterns of misinformation bombardment223, are cur- rently not well understood. Non-text-based correc- tions, such as videos or cartoons, also deserve more exploration 269,270. Third, additional translational research is needed to explore questions about causality, including the causal impacts of misinformation and corrections on beliefs and behaviours. This research should also employ non-experimental methods230,231,271, such as observa- tional causal inference (research aiming to establish causality in observed real-world data)272, and test the impact of interventions in the real world145,174,181,207. These studies are especially needed over the long term — weeks to months, or even years — and should test a range of outcome measures, for example those that relate to health and political behaviours, in a range of contexts. Ultimately, the success of psychological research into misinformation should be linked not only to theoretical progress but also to societal impact 273. Finally, even though the field has a reasonable understanding of the cognitive mechanisms and social www.nature.com/nrpsychol Reviews 24 | January 2022 | volume 1 0123456789();: determinants of misinformation processing, knowledge of the complex interplay between cognitive and social dynamics is still limited, as is insight into the role of emotion. Future empirical and theoretical work would benefit from development of an overarching theoret- ical model that aims to integrate cognitive, social and affective factors, for example by utilizing agent-based modelling approaches. This approach might also offer opportunities for more interdisciplinary work257 at the intersection of psychology, political science 274 and social network analysis275, and the development of a more sophisticated psychology of misinformation.
