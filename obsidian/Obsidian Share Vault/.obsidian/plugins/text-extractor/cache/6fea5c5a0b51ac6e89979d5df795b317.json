Introduction The electricity system in Vietnam is facing many challenges in the coming decades. On the demand side, to maintain a high eco- nomic growth rate, generation capacity has expanded by one- and-a-half to twice the rate of economic growth, averaging 6% per annum over the last decade [10]. Economic restructuring and drastic shifts from a primarily agrarian economy toward heavy reliance on industrial and manufacturing sectors, coupled with the rising living standard of many of its citizens, place sig- niﬁcant stress on the power sector. Rapid urbanization and migration from rural areas to cities contribute to rising electricity consumption. Electricity demand is also strongly inﬂuenced by the ambient temperature. Furthermore, Vietnam has maintained a low domestic electricity price policy, leading to ineffective efﬁ- ciency efforts. Vietnam shares the same load proﬁle showing two peaks during the day, one at around 9-10am and another at 6–7 pm, with many countries. Although hot weather is only one factor, it is probably the most important factor affecting the short-term load. The ﬁgure below shows a typical pattern in a week in March 2021. The power system’s load record of almost 42GW was observed on June 21, 2021, during which hot weather occurred all over the country with the highest daily temperature exceeding 40\u0003C. Air conditioning and cooling are likely the main driver. Theoretically, the law of thermo- dynamics stipulates that energy consumption of cooling equip- ment is highly nonlinear on the differential between outdoor dry-bulb temperature and indoor wet-bulb temperature. The higher the outdoor temperature is, the greater the difference between the outdoor and indoor temperatures, and disproportion- ately more air conditioning equipment will have to operate and consume power. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.111339 0378-7788/\u0001 2021 The Author(s).

Hydropower and thermal power plants (coal, gas, and a minuscule amount of diesel) together account for 94% of the total electricity production in 2020 [33]. Hydropower represents 27% of the total installed capacity, and approximately one-third of the total generation in 2020. Yet, this source has essentially been exhausted. Furthermore, seasonal effects of weather on energy demand could be substantial as hot and dry periods often come with extended droughts and a low water level for hydropower to run at full capacity [17]. As a result, Vietnam is dependent on thermal power sources, especially coal- ﬁred power plants, for a stable and reliable base load supply. The remaining supply originated from renewable resources, including solar, wind, biomass, and imports from Laos and China [13]. The greatest advantage of the electricity system is the low cost of elec- tricity generation; however, the ﬂexibility is not high because ther- mal power plants usually require a certain amount of time to start and operate with high efﬁciency. The average daily load variability, represented by the ratio of the low load to peak load, is 0.53 [33]. Excessive load variations have caused difﬁculties for resource mobilization, spin reserve and frequency modulation in both the dry and rainy seasons due to the north-central transmission constraint, as well as the limited capability of coal power plants to adjust their output. Rapid load variations require maintaining a high reserve margin, which in turn requires keeping many plants in operational modes and raises the cost of generation. Mobilizing diesel generators at peak times could cost up to US21 cents/kWh (based on the current diesel price of approximately US75 cents/liter), nearly three times higher than the average retail price of electricity. These high variations and low reserves are a serious concern for dispatch operators because they could cause grid instability and cascade failures. This study makes two contributions to the literature. It is the ﬁrst to characterize the impact of temperature on power system loads in Vietnam. We present empirical evidence showing a poly- nomial function of up to the third degree linking temperature pat- terns with daily variations in electricity use in northern and southern Vietnam. The nonlinear relationship between tempera- ture and electricity demand is particularly important for the sup- ply–demand balance in Vietnam. Second, we conclude that extreme heating conditions may have a crippling inﬂuence on the electricity sector. As the country has been rapidly moving away from a conventional power system that relies on fossil fuels to a distributed energy system with a high level of variable renewable energy penetration, the potential impact of extreme heating condi- tions on electricity demand must be properly investigated and integrated in future power development planning. The paper proceeds as follow. The second section examines the observed pattern of daily electricity loads and temperature in three regions in Vietnam. Section 3 explains the modeling approach link- ing temperature measurements with the load proﬁle. Section 4 dis- cusses the empirical evidence and concludes with several recommendations for power development policies. 2. Data sources 2.1. Electricity consumption data We obtain comprehensive load data from the National Load Dis- patch Center (NLDC) of Vietnam. The NLDC is a subsidiary of the state-owned Electricity Vietnam Group (EVN). EVN, as the de facto monopoly of the electricity market, owns up to 50% of the genera- tion capacity and has a complete control over transmissions and distribution. The NLDC is the authoritative body with responsibil- ity over the operation and management of the national power sys- tem with a supervisory control and data acquisition and energy management system (SCADA/EMS) centralized at the national cen- ter (A0) in Hanoi and three regional dispatch centers (A1-A3) in charge of regional power systems in the northern, southern, and central regions (Fig. 1, Supplementary Materials). The northern region includes Hanoi capital and its surrounding provinces. The central region stretches through the middle of the country. The southern region incorporates Ho Chi Minh city and the Mekong River Delta. The three regions are interconnected. Power genera- tion in the north is mainly hydroelectricity and coal-ﬁred power, while gas-ﬁred power plants are located in the south. The North– South 500 kV transmission lines are considered to be the backbone of the transmission network. With limited transmission capacity, electricity supply can be tight in either region. Vietnam imports electricity from southern China and Laos and exports it to Cambo- dia using 220 kV grids. Le Viet Phu Energy & Buildings 251 (2021) 111339 2 The load data contain hourly electricity loads in three regions from June 2011 to May 2020. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, Vietnam started social distancing beginning in March 2020. Therefore, the impact of the pandemic is not considered in this study. The load records the total electricity consumption managed by three regio- nal load dispatch centers. We aggregate the hourly load to obtain the daily load. The cleaned data have 3,237 daily observations for each of the three regions. We observe a strong growing trend in the load proﬁle of all three regions (Fig. 2). Overall, the electricity sector has grown by approximately 10–11% in the last two dec- ades, which requires doubling of the generation capacity every seven years. However, regional differences are stark. The northern and southern areas, two major economic hubs, are the largest con- sumers, while there is very little change in the central area. This ﬁnding reﬂects the fact that economic growth in many central pro- vinces has been slow, with most progress observed in the tourism industry in provinces with a long coastal line. The northern area has seen vibrant industrial activities in the northeastern provinces, where large manufacturing facilities are located to take advantage of the young, skilled and disciplined labor force. In the past three years, manufacturing booms and unexpected hot weather have caused signiﬁcant spikes in energy consumption in the northern area during summer. The southern area, including Ho Chi Minh city and the industrial cluster in Binh Duong and Dong Nai, used to be the largest energy users. In the past few years, slowing economic growth and a dominant agricultural economy in the Mekong River Delta have left this region in second place in term of energy use. Electricity demand also displays strong seasonality and busi- ness cycles (Fig. 3). The demand drops dramatically during Lunar New Year holidays and weekends. Immediately after a long New Year celebration, economic activities pick up, resulting in signiﬁ- cant demand for electricity. Coupled with hot weather often felt in May or early June, the demand for electricity rises sharply. For example, the load increased by 73% within 15 days in May 2019 (Fig. 4). Intraday variation is also signiﬁcant, with a ramp rate reaching up to 90 MW per minute in early morning [33]. Until the end of the year, cooler weather reduces electricity consump- tion by up to 30% compared with the peak in summer (Fig. 5). We do not ﬁnd any evidence of demand spikes in winter within the 10-year data series. This may be because the average temper- ature in the north never drops below 5 degrees Celsius (C). The coldest temperature was 5.5\u0003C, recorded on January 24, 2016, which occurred during the 2016 East Asia cold wave. Due to the rarity of cold events, space heating is not regularly required in Vietnam. 2.2. Temperature data We use daily maximum and minimum temperature records from 14 weather stations of the Global Historical Climatology Net- work (GHCN) inside Vietnam. We discard stations without a com- plete record for the study period from June 2011 to May 2020. We also exclude stations located at elevations exceeding 300 meters. The ﬁnal temperature data come from 8 stations, with four used to calculate the average temperature in the northern region, three in the central region, and two in the southern region (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Vietnam’s territory spreads almost 1500 km from north to south. As a result, the load regions possess very different climates. The north has a distinct four-season pattern. During winter, the north may experience temperatures as low as 0 degrees Celsius along the mountainous western and northern borders. However, the temperature often ﬂuctuates around 15–17\u0003C in most parts. Weather in spring and autumn is very mild, with temperatures between 18–24\u0003C. Meanwhile, the summer is signiﬁcantly hot and humid, even at night. Such a harsh weather pattern is a major factor in electricity consumption, especially during summer. In contrast, the south has a tropical savanna climate with two sea- sons, the rainy season and the dry season, and limited temperature variations throughout the year (Fig. 6). The rainy season starts from May to November with a humid climate and high temperature. The dry season is from December to April next year with a dry climate and almost no rain. The southern region has 75% of the number of days in a year with an average temperature in between 25\u0003C and 29\u0003C. The climate in the central region is more diverse, subjected to hot and humid conditions due to Laotian hot and dry winds blowing eastward passing over the Annamite Mountains. The electricity demand likely depends on many meteorological variables other than the temperature alone, such as the cloud cover, rainfall, humidity, wind speed and wind direction [18,3,6]. Unfortunately, we do not have such information. As a result, the temperature response function will likely capture the effect of other factors that covary with temperature. Since the climates in the three regions from north to south are signiﬁcantly different, we estimate a temperature response function for each climate region separately. To correct for the use of the average tempera- ture, which tends to oversmooth the response function and mini- mizes the impact of extreme events, particularly those observed in the temperature characteristic in the north, we use two alterna- tive temperature measurements, the daily mean temperature and the cooling/heating degree days (CDD/HDD). CDD/HDD is a popular concept used in benchmarking the performance of ofﬁce buildings. The CDD/HDD measurement approximates the time duration within a day over which the ambient temperature rises above or drops below a certain threshold so that electricity demand for power equipment starts to rise. 3. Modeling the impact of temperature on electricity demand 3.1. Load forecasting and the impact of weather on electricity load Load forecasting plays a critical role in power system designs and operations. [22]’s classiﬁcation of load forecast is based on the forecast horizon. Short-term (STLF) and very-short-term load forecasts (VSTLF) have duration less than two weeks ahead. Medium-term forecasts (MTLF) have a forecast range from a few weeks up to three years ahead. And long-term forecasts (LTLF) apply to periods after year three. The cut-offs are motivated by the reliability of forecasting inputs such as weather, economics and land use information [11]. These distinct types of forecasting serve different roles, one for operational and others for planning purposes. LTLF is needed for planning and construction of power plants, transmission and distribution grids. MTLF are useful for planning equipment installations or minor upgrades. VSTLF and STLF are critical for automatic generation control (AGC) and eco- nomic dispatching. There are many determinants of the electricity load, such as the population, socio-economic factors such as income and the eco- nomic structure, pricing policies, the presence of substitutes, cli- mate and weather among many other factors [4,47]. At the macroeconomic level, the demand is strongly inﬂuenced by the structure of the economy and economic development policies. The economic structure such as the share of industry, services, agriculture, and residential sectors is a decisive factor of the load curve because each sector has a distinct consumption pattern. Eco- nomic trends, either a recession or an economic boom, are strongly associated with energy demand. Besides, an increasing population and rural-to-urban migration increase electricity consumption. Development practices such as densely constructed buildings in populated cities may affect electricity use due to the effect of urban heat islands [40]. Electricity pricing also inﬂuences the demand for Le Viet Phu Energy & Buildings 251 (2021) 111339 3 electricity as well as for those of substitutable energies such as coal and gas. In Vietnam, the government intervention in the electricity market has kept the retailed price below the economic cost of pro- duction for a long time, resulting in excessive use of electricity rel- ative to other primary energy [1]. At the household level, the residential demand is related to disposable income, stocks of elec- tric equipment, retailed price and consumption behavior [14]. The climate is a factor of long-term load forecasting. Climate refers to the established average pattern of atmospheric conditions over a long period of time, usually longer than 30 years [32]. The climate determines long-term characteristics of electricity demand such as ownership of electric equipment (e.g. heaters or air condi- tioners), building materials, and the economic structure. In con- trast, weather is important for short-term load forecasting, given a ﬁxed stock of electric equipment, the building stock, technology, generation facilities and transmission network [8,9]. Among mete- orological conditions such as temperature, humidity, cloud cover and wind speed, [22] suggest that temperature is the most impor- tant input, especially for short-term load forecasting. Short-term demand is normally inelastic to external shocks due to a ﬁxed cap- ital stock and thus limited ability to substitute one energy input for another [19]. In the long term, demand is more responsive as the capital stock is upgraded, and technical changes and innovations are invented to replace costly production processes. Regarding forecasting techniques, load forecasting is a super- vised learning problem [11]. Traditional parametric methods such as multivariate regressions are suitable for exploring the relation- ship between the load variations and their determinants. The advantage of regressions is the tractability and interpretability of the results. However, econometric forecasting models often assume that the power system structure is unchanged during the forecast period from the observed past. This assumption may result in signiﬁcant errors if the study period spreads over many decades. Advanced methods using machine learning algorithms such as Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) have been increasingly used as powerful tools for solving complex, nonlinear problems in environ- mental sciences [30]. However, many times, these algorithms are considered as a black box that users can not know the inner work- ing mechanism in order to improve their usability and thus the generalizability of the result [54]. 3.2. Decomposition of load data The load proﬁle in Fig. 2 has a clear trend-seasonal-cyclical pat- tern, including a continuous growth trend over time in all three regions, seasonal ﬂuctuations, and cyclical variations between workday, weekends and holidays. The load pattern also shows strong correlation with temperature in Fig. 3. The load rises in summer, peaks around July, presumably due to hot weather, and then wanes by the end of the year. The difference between work- days and weekends is stark. National holidays such as the New Year’s Day, the Lunar New Year, April 30th and May 1st, and September 2nd see a much lower load than usual. Therefore, to analyze the impact of temperature on electricity load, it is neces- sary to separate the factors representing the long-term trend, sea- sonality and short-term business cycles from the random impact of weather variations. Time series data are often decomposed into four components, namely T t, St, Ct, and Rt [23]. T t represents a long-term determinis- tic trend. The trend could be a linear or a higher-degree polynomial of the time. The trend component of electricity load often indicates a long-term tendency of increasing load over time. The St compo- nent represents deterministic seasonal variations with a known periodicity, such as on a monthly or quarterly basis, around the deterministic trend between successive years. The Ct component represents the non-periodic effect of cyclical ﬂuctuations such as business activities on workdays. The remaining component, Rt, represents noises or random variations. In this decomposition, the effect of climate change or other long-term trends such as long-term Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, population increase, and technical progress over time is captured by the time trend component. The seasonal effect of weather or macroeco- nomic activities is captured by the seasonal component. The effect of workdays and national holidays is controlled by the cyclical component. Whatever unexplained variation is captured by the residual component Rt. There are four traditional decomposition methods: additive, multiplicative, log-additive, and pseudo-additive method [43]. Additive decomposition method is formulated as follows: Y t ¼ T t þ St þ Ct þ Rt It is appropriate when the series exhibits no exponential growth, and the amplitude of the seasonal component remains constant over time. The seasonal, cyclical and stochastic compo- nents are assumed to have zero means, so they are level shifts with a mean value of zero around the trend. However, the additive method is not suitable when the data series tends to grow or becomes more volatile over time. Most economic data from devel- oping countries, including the electricity load, have a strong growth pattern. The second decomposition is multiplicative, Y t ¼ T t \u0002 St \u0002 Ct \u0002 Rt The multiplicative method can handle both growth and increas- ing oscillations over time. The seasonal, cyclical and stochastic components are assumed to ﬂuctuate around 1. It is possible to transform a multiplicative decomposition to additive decomposi- tion by using logarithm instead of the level. The log-additive decomposition is an extension of the multiplicative method, rec- ommended when the series contains many small observations, log Y tðÞ ¼ T t þ St þ Ct þ Rt Like additive decomposition, the seasonal, cyclical and random components are assumed to ﬂuctuate around zero. The pseudo- additive decomposition, Y t ¼ T t \u0002 St þ Ct þ Rt \u0003 1ðÞ is sometime used when the seasonal, cyclical and stochastic varia- tions are dependent on the level of the trend but independent of each other. Classical decompositions assume that the seasonal component repeats every year. This is a reasonable assumption for short series, for but long series it may be too strict [23]. For load forecasting, the demand pattern may change in the long term as users upgrade or replace equipment with more energy efﬁcient alternatives. Classi- cal decompositions are also prone to outliers which may occur due to unexpected political or economic events such as strikes or nat- ural disasters causing widespread disruptions of economic activities. Advanced decomposition methods such as X11, X13 and ARIMA have more frequent applications in macroeconomic analysis. The X11 method, developed by the US Census Bureau, has special fea- tures to handle abnormal data and shocks [41]. Subsequent ver- sions such as the X13 Seasonal Adjustment incorporate automatic ARIMA model search, outlier detection, and support for user-deﬁned holidays [42]. However, most methods are devel- oped for quarterly data, and few are applicable to monthly data. High-frequency data (such as weekly, daily or hourly data) require other approaches. Regression-based decomposition such as the STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess) is ﬂexible for any type of time frequencies. STL may allow seasonal changes through tun- Le Viet Phu Energy & Buildings 251 (2021) 111339 4 ing parameters to determine the smoothness of the trend-cycle and seasonal components [7]. In load forecast research, a few stud- ies utilize STL decomposition such as [49,35]. In this study, we choose the regression method with a log- additive form due to the characteristic load growth pattern and widening ﬂuctuations over time. Also, due to missing values, other time series methods are difﬁcult to apply without data imputation. We test both log-additive and additive decomposition and show that the log-additive method performs slightly better than the additive method. The stochastic component is the main interest because it is supposed to contain the impact of temperature varia- tions. If this component still exhibits some trend or a non- stationary process, regression analysis of the temperature-load relation may produce a spurious result. Therefore, we carefully examine the extracted random component of the load to make sure that it has purely random variations with no trend. We also com- pare the result with one using Hodrick-Prescott ﬁlter and ﬁnd that the regression-ﬁltered data has a much better ﬁt. 1 3.3. Modeling and the speciﬁcation of temperature response functions 3.3.1. First-stage decomposition of the load data We assume that electricity load consists of four components, a deterministic time trend, a seasonal factor, a cyclical factor, and a stochastic component that captures the contemporaneous effect of temperature, following [31]. We use log-additive decomposition to separate the load attributable to temperature from the other components. In the ﬁrst step, we estimate model (1) by ordinary least squares: Ln LoadtðÞ ¼ a0 þ a1 \u0004 t þ X12 j¼2 Monthj \u0004 aj þ X2020 k¼2012 Yeark \u0004 ak þ ad \u0004 WDt þ ah \u0004 HDt þ h \u0004 Ln Loadt\u00031ðÞ þ DFt ð1Þ where Ln LoadtðÞ is the logarithm of daily load, t is the time index t ¼ 1; 2; 3 .. .ðÞ, Monthj is a binary variable representing month j, Yeark is a binary variable representing year k, WDt is a binary vari- able indicating a workday, and HDt is a binary variable representing national holidays. We control for the deterministic trend including the potential effect of climate change and economic growth by the time trend t and year dummies. The seasonal effect is captured by a set of month dummies. We control for the effect of business cycles on electricity consumption by including a dummy representing work- days (from Monday to Friday). The holiday dummy is used to cap- ture the effect of national holidays, which is regulated by the Government of Vietnam. We also include a lagged dependent vari- able to account for a potential autoregressive process in the load series. Then, the residual load DF t contains supposedly random variations unrelated to the deterministic trend, the seasonal or cyclical components. In the second stage, we model the residual load DF t as a polyno- mial function of only temperature and separately for each region. We employ two temperature alternatives: the mean temperature and the CDD/HDD unit. Prior to the second stage, we extensively test the DF t series to ensure stationarity and that no time trend exists. 3.3.2. Second-stage impact of temperature on electricity load We model the temperature effect on electricity load by a high- order polynomial of the temperature variable: DFt ¼ b0 þ b1T t þ b2T 2 t þ b3T 3 t þ ... þ et ð2Þ Since the weather records only provide information on the maximum and minimum daily temperature, we derive the average temperature as the simple mean of the two extremes and from all stations within each region. A potential issue with the average temperature is that it may not capture the full picture of intraday temperature variations between regions. Many authors have pre- ferred the use of heating degree days and cooling degree days instead of the mean temperature, as systematically reviewed in [16]. A concept commonly used in agronomy, degree days mea- sures the cumulative heat a plant is exposed to [2]. The CDD and HDD units indicate the time window within a day over which the ambient temperature rises above or drops below a certain threshold. When applied to energy research, the base threshold for cooling degree days is deﬁned as the temperature above which energy will be used to cool the facility. Conversely, the base thresh- old for the heating degree days is the temperature below which energy will be consumed for heating purposes. Physically, the base threshold is the outdoor temperature at which internal heat plus solar irradiation exactly offsets heat losses [15]. Outdoor tempera- tures above the threshold indicate the need for heat removal and vice versa. The threshold is inﬂuenced by indoor temperature, heat loss from conduction, air leakage, and equipment efﬁciency. Most early studies, such as [52,34,8,18], often utilize a simple approach to estimate the accumulated heating/cooling condition based on the difference between the daily mean temperature and a predeﬁned threshold. CDD ¼ T avg \u0003 T cdd if T avg > T cdd 0if T avg 6 T cdd ( and HDD ¼ T hdd \u0003 T avg if T hdd > T avg 0if T hdd 6 T avg ( where T cdd and T hdd are the temperature thresholds for calculating cooling or heating degree days. This method only requires the daily mean temperature to calculate the CDD or HDD units. However, the CDD and HDD units derived from the mean temperature do not take advantage of the available information on temperature variations, and therefore, the calculation may suffer from aggregation bias. The characteristic variations in temperature in northern and south- ern Vietnam differ signiﬁcantly, with northern Vietnam having the largest variation over the day and between seasons, while the tem- perature in southern Vietnam ﬂuctuates over a much narrower range. Thus, the mean temperature may not accurately indicate how much heating or cooling is required because less variation may mean a shorter time period over which a user will need to use energy for heating or cooling purposes. Alternatively, we calculate the CDD and HDD units by approxi- mating a sinusoidal distribution of the temperature from the max- imum and minimum daily temperatures following [50] (Fig. 7). T ¼ TmaxþTmin 2 þ Tmax\u0003Tmin 2 sin tðÞ ¼ M þ Wsin tðÞ where t is the time in radians, from \u0003p=2to3p=2. CDD and HDD will be calculated from the time the temperature crosses a prede- ﬁned threshold THR, presumably 26 degrees Celsius for the cooling degree days and 15 degrees Celsius for the heating degree days. Fig. 7 presents two different temperature patterns. If the maxi- mum temperature is below the threshold, then the CDD unit is just 1 The HP ﬁlter decomposes a series into a stationary trend and a cyclical/irregular component, Y t ¼ Tt þ Ct by minimizing the following loss function: min XT t¼1 Y t \u0003 T tðÞ2 þ k XT t¼2 T tþ1 \u0003 TtðÞ \u0003 T t \u0003 T t\u00031ðÞ½\u00052 () The ﬁrst term penalizes the variance of the cyclical component Ct and the second term penalizes the lack of smoothness in the trend component T t . k is a user- supplied tuning parameter. Le Viet Phu Energy & Buildings 251 (2021) 111339 5 zero. If the minimum temperature is higher than the threshold, the CDD unit is derived as the difference between the daily mean tem- perature and the threshold (right ﬁgure), which is similar to the former approach. If the threshold lies between the maximum and minimum temperatures, the CDD is directly related to the fraction of time the temperature rises above the threshold (left ﬁgure). 2 There is an important distinction in the number of CDD/HDD units calculated by the two approaches. The mean temperature approach will always underestimate the number of CDD/HDD units. Days with the mean temperature below the cooling thresh- old (for example, 26\u0003C) will assume a zero CDD unit. In contrast, the sinusoidal approximation may still indicate a positive CDD unit as long as the maximum temperature rises above 26\u0003C. As a result, the mean temperature approach tends to oversmooth intraday temperature variation, potentially leading to a signiﬁcant bias. This issue likely occurs with the temperature pattern observed in the north and central regions. For example, there was 151 days with mean temperatures higher than 26\u0003C in the north in 2019. The number of days with a maximum temperature higher than 26\u0003C was 238. The mean temperature approach produces a positive CDD unit for only 151 days, whereas there is 238 days with a pos- itive CDD unit recorded using the sinusoidal approximation approach. Regarding the heating and cooling threshold, [52,18] use a sin- gle threshold at 15\u0003C for both the CDD and HDD units, whereas more advanced models could allow the threshold to be endoge- nously determined by a switching regression technique [31] or machine learning [54]. Since the CDD and HDD units are likely speciﬁc to the regional climate, the stock of buildings, industrial activities and socioeconomic factors, we estimate the threshold to calculate the CDD and HDD units for each region separately. There is no clear priori over the speciﬁcation of the temperature-load response function. [22] suggest three ways to estimate the relationship using regression analysis, including a piecewise linear model, a second-order and a third-order polyno- mial. A third-order polynomial is recommended because the typi- cal load pattern often resembles an asymmetric Nike shape. Top- down empirical estimation also assumes a high-order polynomial of the temperature, from a second-order or a third-order polyno- mial as in [8,9] to more complicated eighth-order Chebychev approximation in [44]. [29] use a ﬂexible spline function with a large household dataset to estimate the impact of climate change on household electricity consumption in China. [54] employ a data-driven approach with machine learning to examine various models and determine the optimal temperature base for CDD/ HDD calculation. In this study, we empirically estimate the optimal response function with Monte Carlo cross validation. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Empirical results 4.1.1. First-stage decomposition results The load data decomposition results are presented in Tables 3– 5. We use four types of decomposition, log-additive decomposition (LAD) and additive decomposition (AD), with and without a ﬁrst- order autoregressive component to control the persistence charac- teristics of the data, and for each region separately. The difference between LAD and AD is that the dependent variable is logarithm of demand or the level of demand (in MW). Therefore, for LAD, the parameter is interpreted as the growth rate of the load (in percent- age change) if the explanatory variable has a small change (for con- tinuous variables) or ea \u0003 1 for discrete changes (for categorical variables). For AD, the parameter is the predicted level shift in demand. We ﬁnd that the model ﬁtness is very high, with R2 ranging from 95–98% for the northern load, and 92–96% for the southern load. The central region has the lowest R2 at 73–90%. Including the ﬁrst-order autoregressive component (AR1) increases model predictability substantially. LAD has a slightly higher ﬁtness than AD. All parameters are statistically signiﬁcant and in line with expectations. The deterministic time trend is represented by two parameters, a linear trend a1 and a year-speciﬁc variation around the linear trend ak. The deterministic time trend is strong, showing expected annual increases in the load in all regions. Taking January as the reference, the remaining months often experience an increase in electricity consumption, corresponding to the seasonal pattern of the load proﬁle in Fig. 5. This is due to the impact of the New Year Day and the Lunar New Year holidays often arrived between the third week of January and the second week of February. Normally, there is one week of ofﬁcial holidays; however, informal holidays extend one week before and after the date set by the government, so electricity consumption decreases signiﬁcantly as the economy ceases most productive activities. The northern load is highest in June-September, corresponding to the summer season. The central and southern regions experience higher loads in the last few months of the year. The difference is not due to climate alone, as the seasonal component may be corre- lated with major economic activities. Summer and the end of the year often have a large number of manufacturing orders to fulﬁll, causing the loads to spike. The impact of short-term business cycles and holidays is also evident. Workdays have higher energy consumption than week- ends, especially in the south. This may be due to the fact that southern load is mainly associated with production activities, unlike those of the north and the central regions, at least until recent years. National holidays also have signiﬁcantly lower elec- tricity consumption than usual in all three regions. Figs. 8–11 show the actual and predicted loads and the distribu- tion of the random components ﬁltered from the ﬁrst-stage regres- sion model. There are a few points worth noting: - First, the graph of the residual loads is completely devoid of any trend, seasonal or cyclical characteristics, especially with log additive decomposition with an AR1 regressor. The residual from the regression has a zero mean. Controlling for more lags reduces data noises and outliers signiﬁcantly. However, this may also discard important information of the underlying eco- nomic processes in a dynamic model setting and produce biases. The inclusion of lagged regressors is still an ongoing debate with usage depending on the context [26,55]. In the robustness check, we change the time trend from linear to cubic, and include up to 7th-order lagged regressors in case the business cycle has a day-of-week pattern (i.e. Monday is dif- ferent from Friday). - We perform three different tests, including the Augmented Dickey-Fuller of unit-root process, the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-S chmidt-Shin (KPSS) stationarity test, and the Mann–Kendall trend test to ensure that the ﬁltered residual load series is com- pletely stationary and trendless [28,21]. The results are pre- sented in Table 6 in the Supplementary Materials. Provided that the residual loads are completely random, conventional statistical analysis may be applied. 2 In this case, [53] provide the following exact formula: CDD ¼ 1 p M \u0003 THRðÞ p 2 \u0003 h \u0002\u0003 þ Wcos hðÞ \u0004\u0005 h ¼ arcsin THR\u0003M W \u0004\u0005 [45] shares a program to calculate the HDD and CDD units at any arbitrarily deﬁned threshold. Le Viet Phu Energy & Buildings 251 (2021) 111339 6 - We compare the results with Hodrick-Prescott decomposition and ﬁnd that the regression method produces a much cleaner residual load pattern, especially for outliers that often occur around the Lunar New Year holidays (Figs. 12 and 13). The HP ﬁlter separates the load into a stationary trend and a seasonal/- cyclical component. Putting together, we argue that this regression decomposition has provided us with a valid dataset for second-stage examination of the temperature-load relation. First, the decomposition elimi- nates the impact of long-term trends (climate change, technologi- cal advances, long-term consumption/behavioral changes). Second, the decomposition eliminates medium-term seasonality including the annual economic cycle. Summer has a positive inﬂuence on load, whereas winter has a negative inﬂuence, so that the mean seasonal impact is zero. The seasonal load ﬂuctuations reﬂect dif- ferences in the average weather (or the regional climate). Third, the decomposition also eliminates the impact of short-term busi- ness cycles (workdays versus weekends, and holidays). The remaining unexplained day-to-day load variations, of course, con- tain many factors, but the weather of the day is considered to be the most inﬂuential factor. The decomposition and the extraction of the residual loads Rt will likely lose some information if short-term weather ﬂuctua- tions covary with seasonal or cyclical factors. Generally, the weather is not affected by short-term business cycles or holidays, except in some special case that is not representative. In populated cities, fossil fuel burnings from industrial activities and heavy traf- ﬁcs may result in increased cloud cover and low-level air pollution, which block sunlight and possibly reduce cooling needs. This mete- orological phenomenon has been observed in Ho Chi Minh City. The opposite effect may also occur. That is, air pollution increases electricity use due to increased use of air conditioning. In the Uni- ted States, [20] show that an increase in PM2.5 forces people stay- ing indoor and using more air conditioning. However, at the regional level, this reverse causal effect is likely small. Because the evidence and channels of impact are not clear, we did not con- sider those factors in this study. 4.1.2. Second-stage optimal temperature response function Since the residual loads consist of only random day-to-day ﬂuc- tuations, we examine the load pattern in response to the tempera- ture of the day by both non-parametric and parametric method. The northern load has a typical U-shaped response characteris- tic depending on the ambient temperature (Figs. 14 and 15). At a low temperature, the demand for electricity decreases as the tem- perature rises, presumably reﬂecting a lesser need for heating. The demand is minimal once the temperature reaches an optimal value of approximately 26–27\u0003C. Further rise in temperature results in a higher demand for electricity, implying that cooling needs exceed energy savings from reduced heating purposes. The slope of the load curve is very steep when the temperature exceeds the turning threshold. Due to a warmer climate and limited temperature vari- ations in the central and the south, we do not detect the left branch of a typical load graph which would show the effect of heating on electricity consumption. Typically, the central region has about 30 days a year in which the average temperature drops below 20\u0003C. This number has decreased to less than 10 days in the last two years. Meanwhile, the average temperature has never dropped below 22\u0003C in the south. To calculate the number of CDD and HDD units, we ﬁrst need to determine the temperature threshold. We apply two methods. The ﬁrst is based on a threshold switching regression technique, similar to [31]. The assumption is that the response function has a distinct structure on either side of the estimated threshold (Fig. 16, North). The load function on the left of threshold has a negative slope cor- responding to extra heating requirement as the temperature drops, and the load function on the right of the threshold has a positive slope indicating extra cooling demand as temperature rises. The threshold switching model is implemented by iterative estima- tions over the temperature and the optimal value is one that pro- duces the smallest total error. We have determined the threshold at 26.3\u0003C, applicable to both CDD and HDD, in the north. However, due to the lack of a left branch of the the temperature-load curve in the central and southern regions, it is not possible to identify the switching threshold this way. Then, we identify the CDD threshold by ﬁnding the mean temperature point at which the residual load switches from negative to positive, indicating electricity need for heat removal. We identify that CDD threshold temperature to be 26.85\u0003C and 27.05\u0003C in the central and the south, respectively, which are very close to the northern CDD threshold (Fig. 16, Central and South). These perhaps indicate a similar energy consumption characteristic across the three regions. As showing in Table 2, the CDD unit has increased during the dura- tion of the study from June 2011 to May 2020 in the north and the central, while the trend is unclear in the south. The CDD-load response patterns are shown in Figs. 17 and 18. We detect a similar monotonic increasing trend in electricity demand at higher CDD in all three regions, similar to the pattern observed with electricity demand in Korea [5], Spain [52], or Slove- nia [27]. Particularly in the north, we examine the HDD-load response pattern and conclude that cold weather has almost no impact on power consumption (Fig. 19). We lower the HDD thresh- old to 18\u0003C and arrive at the same conclusion. This ﬁnding may reﬂect the fact that electric heating is not popular in Vietnam. With a tropical climate, there is little heating requirement during winter, unlike the electricity demand pattern in a cold climate region where consumption decreases in summer and increases in winter [52]. Since the central and southern regions have relatively high average tempeatures, we do not estimate the HDD-load response for these regions. Next, we examine the load response function with a parametric method. For central and southern regions, the load function is dependent on the CDD unit only. However, for the north, due to the presence of cooling and heating condition at the same time, the response function must include both CDD and HDD, and their interactions. We assume the response function as a polynomial of the explanatory variables. We implement a Monte Carlo cross validation scheme to select the optimal functional form that pro- duces the least prediction errors. We randomly divide the data into 10 equal subsets (10-fold cross validation). We train the model on the ﬁrst 9 sets, and then estimate the mean squared errors MSE ¼ 1 n P i yi \u0003 byi \u0002\u00032 from the test set. The process is repeated for 500 times. The results of parametric estimation are presented in Tables 7–9. It is clear from the result that the prediction errors of the train- ing set get smaller as we increase the complexity of the response function. We ﬁnd that the load response function is optimal at a third degree in the south, and a linear degree in the central region, and all regressors are statistically signiﬁcant. As for the north, the MSE is not minimized until a ﬁfth degree. Due to the high correla- tion among CDD, HDD, and their many interaction terms, many parameters are not statistically signiﬁcant. As a result, we suggest that the cubic function is still the best speciﬁcation. Yet, we ﬁnd that the cubic parameter is negative, implying that the load curve levels out at very high temperatures (Fig. 20). This may be the ‘‘clipping phenomenon” described in [38]. This effect occurs under extremely hot conditions, the system is working at the maximum capacity and its energy consumption cannot increase further. The CDD-load response is theoretically monotonic, but the slope is dependent on economic characteristics and varies from Le Viet Phu Energy & Buildings 251 (2021) 111339 7 region to region. [34] assume a linear relation. [27] use a second- order polynomial of the CDD. [22] recommend a cubic function. Our result suggests that the response function could have a cubic or even a higher order polynomial, implying potentially more sev- ere impact of rising temperature on electricity load. For sensitivity analysis, we check alternative speciﬁcations including different decomposition methods, increase the time trend to a third degree, increase the number of lagged regressors to 7 to ensure that the result is robust. It may be useful to conﬁrm this ﬁnding in other countries or settings. 4.1.3. Potential impact of temperature on electricity loads The nonlinearity in the temperature-response function implies a large marginal effect of temperature on electricity load. For example, based on the mean temperature-response function in the north, we predict that a 1-degree Celsius increase results in a 1.4 percent increase in electricity consumption when the ambient temperature is 30\u0003C. However, the demand is expected to increase to 4.6% if the ambient temperature is 35\u0003C, and 7.7% if the ambient temperature is 38\u0003C, which is not unusual in the north in summer. Similarly, the estimated marginal effect in the south is only 0.5% at 30\u0003C, rising to 3.5% at 35\u0003C and 7.1% at 38\u0003C. These estimates sup- port [46]’s ﬁndings of a 4.5% jump in household’s electricity demand at the national level due to an increase of 30 CDD units a month (or 1 degree each day). The estimated impact in the central region is low, only 1% at 35\u0003C and 1.5% at 38\u0003C. The ﬁtness of the second stage is low too. We suspect that the weather data is insufﬁcient to capture spatial heterogeneity to closely match the load data. The central region has 3 weather stations, but they are located far away from major load centers such as Da Nang and Quang Nam provinces in the middle of the country. 4.2. Implications for power development policies Around the world, many studies have shown a strong impact of the ambient temperature on electricity load. We suggest that the load response function is a cubic or higher order polynomial of the temperature or the cooling degree days. As a result, hot weather may have very signiﬁcant impacts on electricity consump- tion. With expected increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme heating conditions associated with climate change, Viet- nam may see substantial increases in electricity demand for a vari- ety of energy-related services such as air conditioning and industrial cooling processes. Given that the energy intensity (measured as the kWh con- sumption/unit of GDP) in Vietnam is among the highest in the region and in the world [36], demand side management (DSM) should be the ﬁrst policy priority. Users should be encouraged to reduce electricity consumption during peak hours or shift the time of use from peak to off-peak hours. Load leveling could help reduce the cost of generation and grid investment. Experience in Japan show that energy labeling has produced very promising results [48]. In fact, Vietnam has started piloting a DSM initiative with cus- tomers whose annual electricity consumption exceeding 1 million kWh. This customer category accounts for 2/3 of the northern load, so the savings potential is huge. Vietnam should consider expand- ing time-of-use pricing to a broad base of customers. Currently, only commercial users are allowed this option. Price surges may create incentives for electricity users to avoid the time of peak load. Vietnam currently maintains a relatively low domestic elec- tricity price compared with other countries. Evidence point to a high price elasticity of electricity demand, so pricing instruments could be very effective for DSM [36,37]. Admittedly, it needs a lot more work to identify the extent to which the demand is ﬂexible to DSM and corresponding instruments for administration. On the supply side, as the power system is rapidly transitioning from a centralized system based on traditional large thermal power plants to a distributed system with a high level of variable renewable energy (VRE) integration, ﬂexibility is critical for safe and efﬁcient operation [24]. The impact of temperature variations will likely put an extra pressure on the power system’s ﬂexibility. A system without the necessary capability to ramp up or ramp down may cause sudden power outages, excessive curtailments, instabil- ity, and potentially catastrophic cascade failures. Traditional sources, such as coal power, are designed for providing a base load, but they are not suitable in a rapidly changing environment. Cur- rently, Vietnam continues to rely on existing coal and gas power plants, especially during summer, when the demand increases sub- stantially, and hydropower is limited. As of 2020, coal and gas power still account for almost 65% of the total generation. An impressive development of renewable energy took place between 2018–2020, particularly in solar power, which has seen the total installation capacity increase from practically zero to over 17 GW in two years. Solar power now accounts for a quarter of the total generation capacity and is expected to contribute up to 8.9% of the total generation by the end of 2021 [12]. The higher the share of VRE is in the system, the more ﬂexibility the system needs to function properly. Therefore, long-term forecasting and accurate assessment of VRE maximum operating time are critical to ensure that the system can run safely and in the most efﬁcient manner. New liqueﬁed natural gas (LNG) plants may be required. At least 6 GW total capacity of LNG power plants is to be added to the power pool by 2030 in a business-as-usual scenario, and this amount will be doubled in a high-demand scenario [25]. Future power plants should also be required to have quick start and rapid response characteristics and could operate efﬁciently at a low load. In the long term, large-scale energy storage projects could increase the system ﬂexibility. Vietnam has a few sites suitable for pump-storage hydropower, with a 1200 MW project is being constructed in the south-central coast. The Vietnamese govern- ment has started exploring site storage for utility-scale renewable projects to avoid curtailment; however, this idea has met with lit- tle enthusiasm from private developers. As the cost of battery stor- age is projected to decrease, this option could be feasible in a reasonable time span. Furthermore, climate change may accelerate energy storage adoption due to increased intraday ramping requirements [39]. Rooftop solar power is an inexpensive solution especially suitable for ﬂattening the load curve by reducing cooling needs inside buildings, generating electricity for self-consumption, and feeding back to the grid. Over the past two years, Vietnam has seen more than 9GW of home solar power systems installed to enjoy a lucrative Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) of US8.38 cents/kWh for 20 years. Vietnam should consider extending the home solar pol- icy, albeit with a lower FiT [51]. Investment in transmission grids in a distributed power system is another option to reduce susceptibility to localized weather events. The current transmission grid in Vietnam is weak and unable to dispatch all power from renewable sites to main users in large cities. Therefore, carefully coordinated integration of diverse renewable resources, advanced output forecasting, and on-site consumption should be encouraged to avoid transmission bottlenecks and unnecessary curtailments. Vietnam should also explore interregional and transboundary transmission grids to take advantage of the vast resources in other countries in the Mekong River Basin.
