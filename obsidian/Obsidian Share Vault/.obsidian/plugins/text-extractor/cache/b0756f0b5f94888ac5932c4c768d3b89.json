Leija had voted for the Republican in 2016 and 2020.Leija’s rationale was simple: He said he has beneﬁted from Trump’s economic policies,especially tax cuts.“I am a blue-collar worker,” Leija said. “So, tax breaks for small businesses are ideal for what Ido.”For DaSean Gallishaw, a consultant in Fairfax, Virginia, a vote for Trump was rooted in what hesaw as Democrats’ rhetoric not matching their actions. “It’s been a very long time since theDemocrats ever really kept their promises to what they’re going to do for the minoritycommunities,” he said.Gallishaw, 25, who is Black, also voted for Trump twice before. This year, he said, he thought theformer president’s “minority community outreach really showed up.”Trump gained a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, when he lost toDemocrat Joe Biden, and most notably among men under age 45, according to AP VoteCast, anationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters.POLITICSYoung Black and Latino men say they chose Trumpbecause of the economy and jobs.

Thatwas true for Black and Hispanic voters as well.About 3 in 10 Black men under age 45 went for Trump, roughly double the share he got in 2020.Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men, also were more open to Trump than in 2020.Roughly half of young Latino men voted for Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went forBiden.Juan Proaño, CEO of LULAC, the nation’s largest and oldest civil rights organization for HispanicAmericans, said the election results make it clear that Trump’s messaging on the economyresonated with Latinos.“I think it’s important to say that Latinos have a signiﬁcant impact in deciding who the nextpresident was going to be and reelected Donald Trump,” Proaño said. \"(Latino) men certainlyresponded to the populist message of the president and focused primarily on economic issues,inﬂation, wages and even support of immigration reform.”The Rev. Derrick Harkins, a minister who has served Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, hasoverseen outreach to Black American religious communities for more than a decade. He saidthat Trump’s hypermasculine appeal worked to win over some younger men of color.“I think that Trump with this bogus machismo has been effective amongst the young men,Black, white, Hispanic,” Harkins said. “And I think unfortunately, even if it’s a very smallpercentage, you know, when you’re talking about an election like we just had it can be veryimpactful.”Black and Latino voters’ priorities changed from 2020While about 4 in 10 young voters under 45 across racial and ethnic groups identiﬁed theeconomy as the top issue facing the country, older white and Latino voters were likely to alsocite immigration, with about one-quarter of each saying that was the top issue. 12/16/24, 5:50 PM E lection 2024: How and why young B lack and Latino men chose Trump | A P News chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/4A clear majority of young Black voters described the economy as “not so good” or “poor,”compared with about half of older Black voters. Majorities of Latino voters, regardless of age,said the economy is in bad shape.That belief made it more difﬁcult for Harris to highlight the actual numbers in the economy,which show that inﬂation has receded dramatically, unemployment remains low and wageshave risen. These voters simply did not feel that progress.This is the ﬁrst time Alexis Uscanga, a 20-year-old college student from Brownville, Texas, votedin a presidential election. The economy and immigration are the issues that drove him to votefor Trump, he said.“Everything just got a lot more expensive than it once was for me,” Uscanga said. “Gas, groceryshopping even as a college student, everything has gone up in price and that is a big concern forme and other issues like immigration.”Having grown up selling tamales and used cars, and washing cars, Uscanga knows how hard itcan be to make a living. When Trump was president, he said, it did not feel that way, he said.“Under the Trump presidency more opportunities were abound,” Uscanga said. “I was not veryfond of President Trump because of his rhetoric in 2016 but I look aside from that and how wewere living in 2018, 2019, I just felt that we lived a good life no matter what the media wassaying and that’s why I started supporting him after that.”Though the shift of votes to Trump from Black and Latino men was impactful, Trump could nothave won without the support of a majority of white voters.“Men of color are really beginning to emerge as the new swing voters,” said Terrance Woodbury,co-founder of HIT Strategies, a polling and research ﬁrm that conducted studies for the Harriscampaign.“For a long time, we talked about suburban women and soccer moms who can swing theoutcome of elections. Now men of color are really beginning to emerge as that, especiallyyounger men of color, who are less ideological, less tied to a single party, and more likely toswing either between parties or in and out of the electorate,” Woodbury said.Desire for strong leadership made Trump more appealingA majority of voters nationally said Trump was a strong leader; slightly fewer than half said thesame about Harris. Among Hispanic voters, even more saw Trump as strong in this election. 12/16/24, 5:50 PM E lection 2024: How and why young B lack and Latino men chose Trump | A P News chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 3/4Roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic men described Trump as a strong leader, compared with 43% who saidthat in 2020. About half of Hispanic women said Trump was a strong leader, up from 37%.Black men and women were about twice as likely as in 2020 to describe Trump as a strongleader.David Means, a purchasing manager in Atlanta who is Black, abstained from voting in theelection because he did not feel either Harris or Trump was making the right appeals to Blackmen. But the results of the election did not disappoint him.“I’m satisﬁed with the result. I don’t feel slighted. I wasn’t let down. I wasn’t pulling for Trump orKamala, but I did not want a woman in that position,” he said. And if it were to be a woman,Means said, “I’d rather have a really strong and smart woman, for example, like Judge Judy.”___Figueroa reported from Austin, Texas.
