However, their eﬃcacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study en- deavors to quantify the inﬂuence of incorporating “positive think- ing” into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our ﬁndings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of “positive thinking” prompts posi- tively aﬀected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of ex- perimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best “positive thinking” prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most eﬀective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our ﬁnd- ings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations. KEYWORDS machine learning, language modeling, (automatic) prompt engi- neering 1 INTRODUCTION In the rapidly evolving landscape of artiﬁcial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in transform- ing the way humans interact with technology. As these models become increasingly sophisticated, understanding and inﬂuencing the nuances of their underlying functionality becomes imperative to harness their full potential. Among the myriad factors inﬂuenc- ing the performance of language models, the concept of “positive thinking” has emerged as a fascinating and surprisingly inﬂuen- tial dimension. Intuition tells us that, in the context of language model systems, like any other computer system, “positive think- ing” should not aﬀect performance, but empirical experience has demonstrated otherwise. This paper aims to quantify the impact of various “positive think- ing” additions to the system message of a prompt. In essence, it ex- plores the inﬂuence of seemingly worthless prompt modiﬁcations by measuring the ﬂuctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset. As the quest for near-perfect performance from Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) intensiﬁes, understanding the eﬀect of “positive thinking” in language model prompts can add crucial performance points to test set scores. We will show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. Then we’ll show that not only does systematic prompt optimization outper- form “positive thinking”, even with smaller open-source models, but that it also generalizes better. Additionally, we’ll show that the highest-scoring automatically-generated prompt is remarkably dif- ferent from anything a human practitioner would be likely to gen- erate. 2 RELATED WORK The genesis of prompt engineering can be traced back to the semi- nal Chain of Thought paper by Wei et al. [8]. This pioneering work demonstrated a signiﬁcant enhancement in model performance by introducing a simple prompt modiﬁcation: the inclusion of the di- rective “Think step by step.” The degree of performance improve- ment, however, is contingent upon the speciﬁc model, its size, and the underlying dataset. Subsequently, the PaLM 2 Technical Report by Anil et al. [1] revealed that the application of Chain of Thought prompts may yield adverse eﬀects on certain datasets. This observation under- scores the absence of a universal prompt snippet capable of uncon- ditionally improving model performance. Consequently, the land- scape of prompt engineering has witnessed the emergence of re- sources such as the Prompt Engineering Guide1, aiming to catalog the myriad techniques and scholarly contributions2 constituting the expansive realm of prompt engineering. These endeavors re- ﬂect an ongoing eﬀort to navigate the diverse techniques and in- sights propelling the continuous evolution of eﬀective prompting strategies. In addition to the formally published literature on prompt en- gineering, numerous discussions on less formal discoveries can be found in countless threads on social media platforms such as Twit- ter and Reddit3. 3 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN To test the impact of “positive thinking” prompts, we vary the sys- tem message part of the prompt with a combination of “openers”, “task descriptions”, and “closers” in the following format: <<SYS>>{opener}{task_description}{closer}<</SYS>> Refer to Table 1, 2, and 3 for a comprehensive compilation of the opening snippets, task descriptions, and closing snippets uti- lized in our study. Given the incorporation of 5 openers, 3 task de- scriptions, and 4 closers, our experimentation involved a total of 60 unique combinations. Additionally, we conducted tests both with and without Chain of Thought prompting, resulting in a grand to- tal of 120 prompt combinations per input per model.

The instances where “positive thinking” achieved higher average scores across the optimization and evaluation sets were limited to Mistral-7B with 25 questions and Llama2-70B with 10 questions. However, evaluating performance solely on raw scores is insuﬃ- cient; hence, we also examined the delta between scores on the optimization set and the evaluation set. A lower delta implies su- perior generalization of the prompt. Therefore, the optimal strat- egy combines the highest average score with the lowest delta. See Table 5 for the performance comparison. For Mistral-7B, the results present a mixed scenario. “Positive thinking” exhibits a lower delta for 10, 25, and 50 questions, while the automatically optimized prompt demonstrates a lower delta for 100 questions. Considering Mistral-7B’s model capacity, it is un- derstandable that it faces challenges in optimizing its own prompt when compared to the larger Llama2-13B and 70B models. In con- trast, for both Llama2-13B and 70B models, the automatically op- timized prompts consistently show a lower delta across all cases. Consequently, it is advisable to refrain from manually ﬁne-tuning prompts when using models larger than 7B, and instead, leverage the model’s ability to autonomously optimize prompts. For 7B mod- els, more work is required to see if the trend of automatically opti- mized prompts outperforming manually tuned prompts holds for sample sizes exceeding 100 questions. This recommendation aligns with the original auto-optimization paper. However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the op- timized prompts themselves. They diverge signiﬁcantly from any prompts we might have devised independently. If presented with these optimized prompts before observing their performance scores, one might have anticipated their inadequacy rather than their con- sistent outperformance of hand-tailored prompts. A prime exam- ple is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and pre- ﬁx generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset: System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» Answer Preﬁx: Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proﬁciency in mathe- matical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an aﬃn- ity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently. For a comprehensive col- lection of the peculiar and fascinating prompts generated by the three models, refer to Appendix C. arXiv, Feb 2024, Preprint Ba\u0000le & Gollapudi In this paper, we showed that you don’t need massive commer- cial models like PaLM 2 or GPT-4 to tune your prompt. Mistral-7B struggled to optimize its own prompt until it had 100 questions to work with. Llama2-13B and 70B were able to produce supe- rior prompts with as little as 10 questions to optimize with. And while the prompts they generated may appear shocking to an ex- perienced practitioner, it’s undeniable that the automatically gen- erated prompts perform better and generalize better than hand- tuned “positive thinking” prompts.

C.5 Llama2-13B Optimized Prompt & Preﬁx NoQ=10 System Message: The improved instructions for the language model My proposed instruction is to solve for x in the equation 2x + 3 = 7 using a clever and creative method, and provide your answer in the form aha! You've got it! The solution to the equation 2x + 3 = 7 is x = 4. This solution is clever and creative because it uses a unique and unconventional approach to solving the equation. For example, the model could use a visualization of the equation as a balance scale, with 2x representing the weight on one side and 3 representing the weight on the other side. By using this visualization, the model can see that the scales balance at x = 4, which is the solution to the equation. Additionally, the model could provide a step-by-step explanation of their solution, including any necessary definitions or assumptions, and elaborate on the reasoning behind each step. This will help the model to not only provide the correct answer, but also understand the underlying math and provide a clear and concise explanation. Answer Preﬁx: Ah ha! You've got it!
