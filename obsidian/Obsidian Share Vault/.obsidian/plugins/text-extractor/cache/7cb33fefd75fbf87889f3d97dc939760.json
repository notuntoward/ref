NERC Long Term Reliability Assessment • Elevated or high risk in many regions • Winter fuel supply a major challenge • Capacity reserves a challenges in some regions Recent Events • Winter storm Elliott (end 2022) • Winter storm Uri (early 2021) • Alberta (early 2024) Source: NERC Long Term Reliability Assessment (link) Source: NERC-FERC Winter Storm Elliott Report: Inquiry into Bulk-Power System Operations During December 2022 (link) © 2024 Electric Power Research Institute, Inc.

Increased shares of variable renewables • Energy storage, demand flexibility and thermal plant needed to balance periods of low wind/solar • Transmission, T&D interaction and other energy system interactions will all impact needs Increased reliance on electricity • Often best way to decarbonize society’s energy needs • Increases in demand coming unseen in decades • Energy growth in developing world needs to be clean Source: Adequacy studies (elia.be) Example from Belgium: From EPRI LCRI Net-Zero 2050: U.S. Economy-Wide Deep Decarbonization Scenario Analysis (link) © 2024 Electric Power Research Institute, Inc.

Additionally, several case studies ran additional sensitivities to better understand the impact of storage modeling practices on results. ▪ Evaluated the impact of varying look-ahead periods on adequacy results. SPP case study • Evaluated the impact of short-duration vs. medium-duration vs. long-duration storage on system adequacy. • Evaluated the impact of the following parameters on medium-duration storage modeling: • Periodic vs. linked simulations • Outage derates vs. stochastic outage replications • Develop an iterative methodology for long-duration storage portfolio to ensure that the system doesn’t discharge more than it charges during a given year. • Evaluated the impact of the following parameters on long-duration storage modeling: • Start date • Optimization window • State-of-charge depletion penalty Western US case study ▪ Evaluated the impact of storage scheduling options on adequacy results (for example, minimizing system cost versus minimizing adequacy shortfalls) ▪ Evaluated the impact of increasing storage duration on system adequacy. ▪ Tracked the variation in shortfall event causes as renewable and storage penetration increased (capacity limit vs. energy duration limit vs. energy charge limit) Texas case study © 2024 Electric Power Research Institute, Inc.

Multiple objective functions considered in PLEXOS: • Economic: minimize system cost (number of hours), (PLEXOS default – minimize cost, with high unserved energy cost) • Min LOLEv: minimize the number of events • First Come First Serve: immediately discharge at max output as soon as unserved energy starts and do not hold energy for later periods (likely reflects actual operations, absent market intervention) • Min Shortfall: minimize the depth of the shortfalls (max load unserved for any given hour, potential market operator intervention) Different methods of dispatching batteries under scarcity conditions yield different results for LOLE but identical results for EUE Econ Min LOLEv First Serve Min Shortfall LOLE (days/yr) 0.103 0.103 0.082 0.105 LOLH (hours/yr) 0.387 0.438 0.230 0.557 EUE (MWh/yr) 724.52 724.52 724.52 724.52 Avg Depth (GW) 2.2 2.0 3.9 1.4 Max Depth (GW) 6.3 6.3 9.0 4.3 Avg Duration (hrs) 2.8 3.3 2.8 5.8 Note: Min LOLEv optimization did not result in lower LOLE than alternative methods due to step size and optimization horizon, and different definitions of event classification (i.e. consecutive hours vs. days, etc.) © 2024 Electric Power Research Institute, Inc.

Challenging years are less frequent, but events are much larger. Weather risk arises in 2017, which saw both a cold winter and a hot summer in the West RA risk is much more dependent on the combination of weather and hydro conditions because the system is energy-limited.WECC case study results © 2024 Electric Power Research Institute, Inc. All rights reserved.17 Correlated Outage Modeling Varying approaches to weather-dependent outage modeling were identified and applied across all case studies, depending on data availability, tool capability, and modeling choices. Many modeling choices: ▪ Model weather-dependent unavailability as a capacity derate vs. as a forced outage rate ▪ Recalibrate base forced outage rates vs. not ▪ Model the impact of natural gas unavailability and/or the impact of extreme temperatures on generating equipment ▪ Adjust time-to-outage values only or both time-to-outage and time-to-repair values ▪ Adjust full outage rates only or both full outage rates and partial outage rates Models Varying tool capabilities: • Some tools allow for forced outage rates to be varied directly as a function of temperature. • Some tools allow for forced outage rates to be varied temporally, but not as a function of temperature. Hourly forced outage rates can be created which reflect the temperature variation, but they will vary from one weather year to another, and results must be merged in post- processing. • Some tools don’t allow for forced outage rates to be varied hourly or as a function of temperature, and workarounds must be used. Tools Limited data availability: ▪ Create custom capacity derate information using historical GADS and temperature data ▪ Use data from CMU method (Murphy et al) ▪ Either use as is, or shift based on location compared to PJM ▪ Assume all affected units are derated or offline past a certain temperature threshold ▪ Affected units– consider plant vintage? Consider dual-fuel units? ▪ Temperature threshold – What temperature threshold to use? Daily or hourly? Averaged over what region? Data © 2024 Electric Power Research Institute, Inc.
