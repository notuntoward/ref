However, the higher energy density of LIBs results in poor safety performance. Thermal runaway (TR) is the critical problem which hinders the further application of LIBs. Clarifying the mechanism of TR evolution is beneficial to safer cell design and safety management. In this paper, liquid nitrogen spray is proved to be an effective way to stop the violent reaction of LIBs during TR process. Based on extended-volume accelerating rate calorimetry, the liquid nitrogen ceasing combining with non-atmospheric exposure analysis is used to investigate the TR evolution about LiFePO4/graphite batteries at critical temperature. Specifically, the geometrical shape, voltage, and impedance change are monitored during TR process on the cell level. The morphologies/constitution of electrodes and separators are presented on the component level. Utilizing the gas analysis, the failure mechanism of the prismatic LiFePO4/graphite battery is studied comprehensively. Key words： lithium-ion batteries; thermal runaway; evolution mechanism; liquid nitrogen ceasing technology; non-atmospheric exposure analysis. Journal Pre-proof INTRODUCTION Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been commercialized for 30 years since 1991 (Fleming, 2015; Wang et al., 2021). Nowadays, LIBs are widely used as the energy storage devices for electronic products, vehicles, spacecraft, etc. due to their relatively high power/energy density, long cycle life, no memory effect, and eco-friendly properties (Dai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2020). However, a series of serious accidents related to LIBs indicate that the safety hazard is still a barrier for its large-scale applications in the field of transportation, especially new energy vehicles (NEVs) (Hu et al., 2020). Efforts are urgently required to investigate the thermal runaway (TR) mechanism of LIBs to develop safer NEVs. Thermal response is directly relevant to the safety performance of LIBs. The undesirable heat with a certain chance to result in TR could be triggered by mechanical abuse (crush, penetration, vibration, etc.) (Duan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020), electrical abuse (overcharge, over-discharge, short-circuit, etc.) (Ren et al., 2019a), and thermal abuse (external heating, internal heating, etc.) (Bugryniec et al., 2019). In general, the heat generated by abnormal abuse is the main precipitating factor for TR, which can destroy the original stable structure of the battery and result in a series of chain reactions including the decomposition of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), the reaction between lithiated carbon and electrolyte, the decomposition of electrolyte, the melt of separator, the decomposition of cathode, and so on. (Feng et al., 2020). Many efforts have been done to find out the complicated mechanism of battery thermal runaway. On component level, each constituent has been tested to explore the thermal response and abuse response. For example, M. N. Richard et al. studied the thermal stability of lithium intercalated graphite in electrolytes by accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) and found out the two reaction steps including the decomposition of metastable components of SEI and the reaction Journal Pre-proof between intercalated lithium and electrolyte (Richard and Dahn, 1999). Seong- Min Bak et al. systematically investigated the thermal properties of Ni-rich ternary materials Li(NixCoyMnz)O2 (x>0.5) (NCM) cathodes including NCM 433, NCM 523, NCM 622, and NCM 811 by using in situ time-resolved X-ray diffraction and mass spectroscopy (TR-XRD/MS) techniques (Bak et al., 2014). They analyzed the cathode phase transition in detail and found that the more Ni content is, the lower the onset temperature of the phase transition and the large amount of oxygen release are (Bak et al., 2014). Joachin et. al. studied the thermal stability of carbon-coated LiFePO4 by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Their research indicates that because of the existence of strong P-O covalent bond in (PO4)3-, the olive LiFePO4 shows better thermal stability than layered oxide cathode materials (Joachin et al., 2009). Although there are some works concentrating on the component level, the thermal response on cell level should be conducted because the LIBs are the complex electrochemical systems which contain many kinds of active materials together to store electrical energy. Doughty et al. employed accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) to measure the thermal response of high-power 18650 LIBs and speculated the chemical reactions during thermal runaway process (Roth and Doughty, 2004). On that basis, Feng et al. pioneered the improved extended-volume accelerating rate calorimetry (EV-ARC) to study TR of large format LIBs and summarized three critical temperatures T1, T2, and T3 which represent the onset temperature of self-heating, the TR triggering temperature, and the maximum temperature during TR process, respectively (Feng et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2019). To compare the thermal behaviors of LIBs built by different material systems, Lei et al. used ARC to test three kinds of 18650 LIBs with the cathode of LiMn2O4 (LMO), LiFePO4 (LFP), and Li(Ni0.33Mn0.33Co0.33)O2 (NMC 111), respectively (Lei et al., 2017). They confirmed that the cell with LFP as the cathode exhibits better thermal stability, while the cell with NMC as the cathode shows the terrible temperature tolerance (Lei et al., 2017). Moreover, Journal Pre-proof the difference in maximum temperature between LFP and NMC is more than 400 ℃ (Lei et al., 2017). Furthermore, the toxic gaseous emission and the combustion hazards can result in serious secondary disaster for battery systems, which attract much attention from researchers. Thaler et al. studied the gas emission of 18650 cells with three types of cathodes (LFP, NMC, and LCO/NMC) during the TR process (Golubkov and Fuchs, 2014). They found that the metal-oxide cells release huge amounts of gas rapidly, while the LFP cell releases a small amount of gas at a low rate (Golubkov and Fuchs, 2014). The componential analysis illustrates that the main components for metal-oxide cells are H2, CO2, CO, and a small amount of CH4, C2H4, and C2H6 (Golubkov and Fuchs, 2014). In contrast, the CO emission for LFP cells only occupies a small proportion (Golubkov and Fuchs, 2014). Furtherly, Huang et al. studied the combustion behavior of 50 Ah NMC/LTO batteries (Huang et al., 2015). The combustion process was divided into three stages: igniting, stably combusting, and extinguishing (Huang et al., 2015). However, the complex structure blocks the observation of the failure mechanism for commercial LIBs during the TR process. Understanding the change in the internal mechanism of commercial batteries during TR process is necessary for industries. Finegan et al. applied X-ray computed tomography (CT) as a non-destructive tool to build high-spatial resolution three-dimensional (3D) images which could help researchers analyze the structural change of batteries during TR process (Finegan et al., 2015). But this research focuses on macro-level. Disassembly is deemed to be the most effective way to study the internal change of the cell during TR. The liquid-nitrogen-ceasing (LNC) technology is proved to be an effective way to freeze the dramatic chain reaction during TR process. Ren et al. investigate the relationship between internal short circuit (ISC) and TR of cell by LNC technology (Ren et al., 2021). Journal Pre-proof In this study, LNC technology combined with non-atmospheric exposure post- mortem analysis is applied to investigate the TR process by stages for the first time. A 24 Ah prismatic battery with relatively stable LFP as the cathode was chosen as the specimen. Firstly, the thermal runaway features of this battery were measured by EV-ARC. Secondly, the LNC technology was applied to stop the TR process at critical temperatures so that the post-mortem analysis could be conducted to investigate the internal mechanism of TR. The disassembly of cells is divided into five parts, including the cell at ambient temperature (Tamb, the subscript amb is abbreviated for ambient), self-heating temperature (TSH, the subscript SH is abbreviated for self-heating), TR temperature (TTR, the subscript TR is abbreviated for thermal runaway), venting temperature (TV, the subscript V is abbreviated for venting), maximum temperature (Tmax, the subscript max is abbreviated for maximum temperature). Besides the macroscopic and microscopic characterization, the gas emission at each node has been analyzed. Through the detailed analysis, the TR mechanism of this prismatic LFP battery is comprehensively expounded. RESULTS External Characteristics of Thermal Runaway During the thermal runaway process, LIBs suffer complex chain reactions. Figure S2 shows the temperature data and temperature rate curves during the test. Based on the test data, four critical temperatures are recognized to evaluate the thermal runaway performance of LIBs. TSH is the onset temperature for detectable self-heating, which indicates the temperature of LIBs rise rate exceeds 0.02 ℃ /min. TTR is considered as the trigger temperature for TR, which forebodes that the exothermal reactions are so violent that the temperature rises dramatically. The definition of TTR has been identified when the temperature rate of LIBs achieves 1 ℃/min as Figure S2 Journal Pre-proof shows. TV is the venting temperature of the cell during TR process. Tmax is the maximum temperature during the whole ARC test. Then, the LNC technology is applied to freeze the cell when the cell is heated to the corresponding temperature and the results are shown in Figure 1. Figures 1(a-I)-(e-I) show the three-view photo of the cell at different temperature nodes including Tamb, TSH, TTR, TV, and Tmax, respectively. During the freezing process, the voltage and temperature of the cell were recorded synchronously. Figures 1(b-II)-(e-II) shows the temperature, voltage vs. time ((T-V)-t) curves when the sample was quick-frozen by liquid nitrogen at different temperature nodes including TSH, TTR, TV, and Tmax, respectively. It can be seen clearly that the sprayed liquid nitrogen freezes the cell from specific temperature to ambient temperature rapidly. It is found that the inflation of cell gets worse and worse as the temperature goes on. After venting (Figure 1d), a mass of combustion products latches onto the surface around the safety valve. The detailed information is summarized in table 1. The voltage drops to 3.25 V at TTR. Besides that, the resistance in TTR increases to 40.378 mΩ, which is around 40 times larger than that of the fresh cell (0.978 mΩ). When the temperature reaches TV, the battery expands to its maximum volume and the voltage drop to 0.329 V. In addition, the venting results in 57 g mass loss. At Tmax, the battery loses its voltage and the mass loss is 100 g compared to the fresh one. Thermal Runaway Mechanism Identification The cell cooled by liquid nitrogen spraying is dissembled in the glove box and dried out in an argon atmosphere. SEM, XPS, EDS, GC-MS tests were conducted to identify the thermal runaway mechanism. Digital & SEM images. Figures 2-4 show the digital photos and SEM images of anode, cathode, and separator of the specimens at different temperature. With the temperature rising, the active materials show the tendency of breaking Journal Pre-proof away from current collector. For anode, the active materials have peeled off from copper current collector partly at TTR (Figure 2c-I). In comparison, cathode shows stronger stability with the intact form at the same time (Figure 3c-II). Besides that, the separator prefers to latch onto the surface of cathode rather than anode (Figure 3c-I). It should be noted that the electrodes become inhomogeneous as the temperature rise. For anode, beside the exposed copper current collector, two different morphologies including the gold part and black part on the surface of anode at TV are shown in Figure 2d. The SEM images show that the graphite particles on each part are clearly visible. The difference between them is the impurity size around graphite. Figure 2e presents two different morphologies with the yellow and black part after thermal runaway (Tmax). Figure 2e-II shows that there are a lot of small particles covering the graphite evenly in the yellow part. Figure 2e-III shows that the graphite is covered by membrane-like deposits in the black part. For cathode, there is no obvious change occurring before TSH as Figure 3a and Figure 3b show. But the separator adheres to the cathode at TTR (Figure 3c-I). By removing the separator, the cathode demonstrates three different areas as Figure 3c-II shows, which include black, grey, and abnormal part. Comparing each SEM image with others (Figures (3c-III)-(3c-V)), it can be found that some neat active particles are observed in black area, film-like covering in grey area, and agglomerated particles in abnormal area. The melt separator attaches to the cathode tightly at TV (Figure 3d-I). The SEM image of cathode is shown as Figure 3d-II, which shows the uniform active particles clearly. The digital photos of cathode after thermal runaway (Tmax) show that the active materials have been peeled off from aluminum current collector partly. Besides that, there are some wreckages of separator remaining on the surface of cathode (Figure 3e- I). The SEM image shows that the active materials remain homogeneous (Figure 3e-II). Journal Pre-proof The digital images of separator are shown in Figure 4. As we can see, there is no obvious variation of separator from Tamb to TSH (Figure 4a and Figure 4b). But the separator melts and sticks to the cathode tightly at TV as Figure 3d-I shows. After thermal runaway, the separator breaks into pieces as Figure 2e-I shows. The SEM images for ceramic coating show no substantial changes during the whole process, which demonstrates the excellent thermal stability of ceramic particles. In contrast, the shrinkage of polyolefin substrate is obvious. Figure 4c-IV shows that the separator has closed its micropore completely at TTR. These phenomena will be analyzed in detail in the following content. XPS spectra. Figure 5 and Figure 6 present XPS spectra of anode and cathode respectively at different stages. C1s spectra is divided into four peaks at binding energies of 284.7 eV, 286.8 eV, 288.5 eV, and 290.1 eV, which represent the chemical bond of C-C, C-O, C=O/CO3, and C-F, respectively (Castro et al., 2010). Three peaks are divided at binding energies of 532.0 eV and 533.4 eV for O1s spectra, which represent the chemical bond of C=O/CO3 and C-O respectively. F1S spectra has been divided into two peaks at 685.2 eV and 687.1 eV, which represent LiF and C-F/F-P (Castro et al., 2010). Besides that, the peaks at 133.4 eV and 136.3 eV for P2p spectra corresponding to P-O and P-F respectively (Castro et al., 2010). It is reported that the C-O and C=O/CO3 belong to LiCO3, ROCO2Li, and (CH2OCO2Li)2, which are the important components of SEI interface. C-C belongs to carbon black SP which works as the conductive agent to connect the current collector and active materials. C-F belongs to the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which works as the binder to attach active materials to current collector. While the P-O and P-F belong to LiFePO4 and LiPF6. For anode, when the temperature reaches TSH, C-F, C=O, -CO3, C-O, C-C, and LiF were detected on the surface. It can be seen that the SEI film is an important component on the surface of anode. As the temperature rises to TV, the intensity of C-O increases significantly, which indicates the generation of metastable Journal Pre-proof components (ROLi, (CH2OCO2Li)2 and ROCO2Li). After thermal runaway, the C-F, P-F, and C=O have disappeared, which indicates the decomposition of PVDF, LiPF6, and metastable components of SEI interface. In contrast, the intensity of CO3 increases significantly, indicating the final product on the negative electrode surface contains a lot of Li2CO3. As the intensity of C-C declines, the sp2C peak appears and increases rapidly, which belongs to the graphitized carbon. That is to say, the carbon in anode has been graphitized at Tmax. For cathode, C-F, C=O, -CO3, C-O, C-C, P-O, and LiF were detected on the surface. The data for C-F, C=O, -CO3, C-O, C-C, and LiF show the similar trends liking anode. As a contrast, the intensity of P-O seems to be independent of temperature, which demonstrates the excellent thermal stability of LiFePO4. EDS. The compositions of the deposits on electrodes are characterized by EDS, which could work as an important complement for XPS spectra. The anode cooled by liquid nitrogen shows that the content of C element decreasing as the temperature rise while the content of O, F, and P increases, which should be attributed to the complex chemical reactions including decomposition/regeneration of SEI, decomposition of LiPF6 (Table 2). The cathode cooled by liquid nitrogen shows the steady content of P, which confirms the excellent thermal stability of P-O (Table 3). Besides that, Table 2 and Table 5 demonstrate that there is little nitrogen element existing on the surface of anode, which proves that the rapid cooling has less effects on the cell and its post-mortem analysis. It should be emphasized that the representative parts in electrodes were chosen to conduct XPS and EDS tests for electrodes. GC-MS. The gas releasing is considered as an important cue to study the internal reactions during thermal runaway process. Figure 7 presents the gas Journal Pre-proof composition analyzed by GC-MS. The analysis shows that the CO account for 47.07% of the gas production at TSH, while the CH4 for 31.67%, CO2 for 12.66%, C2H6 for 6.08%, and so on. As a contrast, the H2 becomes the main components at TTR, which accounts for 28.08%, while the CO for 27.27%, C2H4 for 19.48%, CH4 for 18.76%. Self Heating (TSH) The SEM images of anode and cathode taken from liquid nitrogen cooled cell at TSH are shown in Figure 2b-II and Figure 3b-II respectively. The graphite or LFP particles with neat-looking are seen on the surface of electrodes. Although the morphology of electrodes at TSH seems no different from the normal one at room temperature, the side reactions have resulted in the gas releasing in fact. The gas component analysis at TSH is illustrated as Figure 7a shows. As we can see, the gases are composed of oxycarbide and hydrocarbon. The gas analysis shows that the CO is the main product account for 47.07%, while the CH4 for 31.67%, CO2 for 12.66%, and C2H6 for 6.08%, etc. Combined with the XPS analysis, the events occurring in this stage could be summarized as follows. When the temperature rises up to the detectable temperature of self-heating (TSH=116.74 ℃ ), the metastable components (such as polymers, ROLi, (CH2OCO2Li)2 and ROCO2Li) decompose, which results in the fracture of SEI layer (Leroy et al., 2005; McArthur et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2006). The major chemical reactions are summarized as follows (Aurbach et al., 1997; Fu et al., 2015; Lai et al., 2021): 224232222 5.0)( OCOHCCOLiLiOCOCH  (Equation 1) 4232222 2)(2 HCCOLiLiOCOCHLi  (Equation 2) 2 2 322Li CO Li CO CO   (Equation 3) Journal Pre-proof Once the layer is broken, the active materials will lose the protection of SEI layer and react with the electrolyte. This process is an exothermic reaction which drives the temperature up still further (Wang et al., 2012). Once the intercalated lithium is exposed to electrolyte, it would react with carbonate- based organic solvents of the electrolyte. (Wang et al., 2005). The chemical reactions of this kind of batteries are summarized as follows (Lai et al., 2021; Shin et al., 2002; Spotnitz and Franklin, 2003): 4232343 )(2 HCCOLiECOHCLi  (Equation 4) 3 4 3 22 ( ) 2Li C H O EC CH OLi CO   (Equation 5) 5 10 3 2 3 2 4 2 62 ( ) +Li C H O DEC Li CO C H C H   (Equation 6) 5 10 3 3 22 ( ) 2Li C H O DEC CH CH OLi CO   (Equation 7) In this stage, the outstanding content of CO can be regarded as the important signal to monitor the health of battery. Thermal runaway (TTR) As time goes by, the temperature reaches thermal runaway detectable temperature (TTR=170.235 ℃), meanwhile, the cell swells, and the thickness increases to 41.35 mm because of the internal pressure (Figure 1b). Anode. The disassembly photos of anode are shown in Figure 2c. The digital photo (Figure 2c-I) indicates that the active materials have been peeled off from copper current collector partly, which should be ascribed to the failure of binder (Chen et al., 2018; Zou and Manthiram, 2020). The strong signal on H2 (Figure 7b) is resulted from the intercalated lithium reacting with polymer binder in negative electrode. The reaction of metallic Li with PVDF is shown in Equation (8) (Chen et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2020; Zou and Manthiram, 2020). Journal Pre-proof 2 2 20.5CH CF Li LiF CH CF H         (Equation 8) The SEM image (Figure 2c-II) shows that there are some thick membrane-like deposits deposit on the surface of anode. The anode cooled by liquid nitrogen has been characterized by EDS in table 2. The results present that the content of P increases sevenfold and the content of F increases sixfold, which should be ascribed to the deposition and decomposition of LiPF6. The partially decomposed LiPF6 will produce a large amount of LiF as Equation (9) shows. 56 PFLiFLiPF  (Equation 9) The PF5 produced by the decomposition of LiPF6 is a strong Lewis acid which will attack the SEI layers (Yang et al., 2005). At the same time, the damaged SEI layer is repaired by the reaction between the electrolyte and intercalated Li (Kim et al., 2017). Besides that, PF5 will react with organic solvents as Equation (10) shows, which is the reason why the amount of C2H4 goes up at TTR (Figure 7b). 2 5 2 5 5 2 5 4 2 2()C H OCOOC H DEC PF C H OCOOPF HF CH CH     (Equation 10) Cathode. Figure 3c-I shows that the separator has adhered to cathode tightly. Removing the separator, the intact cathode has emerged (Figure 3c-II). There are three different morphologies being founded in cathode, which includes the black part marked by green dotted line in Figure 3c-III, the grey part marked by blue dotted line in Figure 3c-IV, and the abnormal part with protuberant point marked by red dotted line. The SEM image of black part is shown as Figure 3c- V. The LFP particles with neat-looking are seen on the surface of cathode (Figure 3c-III). However, some deposits on the surface of cathode are observed in grey part (Figure 3c-IV). In comparison, protuberant points show the agglomeration of bulky grain with the diameter of 10 µm on the surface of cathode (Figure 3c-V). Combined with the analysis of XPS (Figure S3), we find Journal Pre-proof that the different morphology of cathode is inextricably linked to the residue of LiPF6 and LiF. The EDS has been applied to characterize the surface of cathode as table 4 displays, which indicates that there is a great difference of F element for each area. The film-like material deposited on the cathode (grey part) showed in Figure 3c-IV is similar to that on anode (Figure 2c-II). The accumulation and decomposition of LiPF6 (Equation 9) should be responsible for this phenomenon. For abnormal area, the content of F reaches 65.2%, and the XPS spectra Figure S3 shows an enhanced intensity of LiF. That indicates the formation of bulky grains is attributed to the aggregation of LiPF6. That is to say, the difference in morphology of cathode at TTR is mainly caused by the heterogeneous deposition of LiPF6. Separator. The ceramic particles facing the anode are clearly visible, which shows excellent stability (Figure 4c-III). But the polyolefin substrate with micropores has turned into the nonporous insulating layer (Figure 4c-IV), which should be responsible for the drastic increase of impedance at TTR as shown in Table 1, in which the resistance increases to 40.378 mΩ much larger than the initial value. Besides that, the melt of polyolefin substrate causes the cementation between separator and cathode (Figure 4c-I). It should be emphasized that the evaporation of electrolytes can be another reason for the swell of battery. It is reported that the boiling points of EMC and DEC are 110 ℃ and 126 ℃ (Fu et al., 2016; Tang et al.). Venting (TV) Pressure relief is an important safety function, which responds to the sudden increase of internal pressure. As the gas produced by the side reaction increases the internal pressure, the safety valve opens at TV (182.582 ℃). After that, the flammable jet flow released from safety valve is ignited, which results in violent combustion. In this stage, the cell expands to its maximum volume Journal Pre-proof with a thickness of 50.31 mm. Anode. The cell disassembly photos of anode cooled by liquid nitrogen are displayed in Figure 2d. Besides the exposed copper, the exterior appearance of anode could be divided into gold part and black part, which is closely related to the intercalated lithium. In general, the fully charged graphite anode will appear with the golden appearance (Ren et al., 2019b; Yuan et al., 2015). It is deduced that the partial exhaustion of electrolyte should be responsible for the tremendous growth of resistance and the partial discharge of electrode because the transport channel of lithium-ion is blocked. This theory explains the voltage fluctuation after the instant drop of it caused by massive-ISC. The SEM images of Figure 2d-II and Figure 2d-III demonstrate that the irregular particle morphology of graphite is clearly visible. Besides that, there are some spherical particles with the diameter around 1 µm scattered around graphite, which shows a larger size for black area rather than gold part. The EDS was applied to characterize the surface of anode as Table 5 shows. As we can see, the content of C, O, and F in black area shows an obvious increase compared to gold area, indicating the large generation of SEI-like substance. In a summary, the different morphologies in anode are caused by the heterogeneous reaction between active materials and electrolytes/binders. Cathode. The cell disassembly photos of cathode are shown in Figure 3d. As we can see, the separator has attached to the cathode apparently because of the melt of PP substrates. The remains of separator are removed to expose the cathode. The SEM image of cathode is shown as Figure 3d-II, which shows the neat-looking particles of LFP clearly. The XPS spectra (Figure 6) confirms the excellent thermal stability of P-O, which proves the LFP is stable at TV. Separator. The separator has melted and adhered to cathode tightly as Figure 4d-I shows. Besides that, the melted separator absorbs some active materials Journal Pre-proof from anode which is the black part of Figure 4d-I. The SEM image (Figure 4d- II) shows that the ceramic particles facing the anode are clearly visible, which shows excellent stability of ceramic coating. But the micropores of polyolefin substrate have been destroyed completely as Figure 4d-III shows. Wreckage (Tmax) The violent combustion has occurred. After TR, the weight loss of the cell is about 100 g compared to the initial weight of 551 g. Anode. The cell disassembly photo of anode is shown in Figure 2e. The digital photo of anode shows that the surface of anode can be divided into yellow and black parts. The yellow part is the remains of separator which adhere to the surface of electrode tightly. Figure 2e-II shows that the graphite has been covered by uniform particles with the diameter of 1 μm on the yellow area. While there are some thick membrane-like deposits deposit on the surface of black part (Figure 2e-III). The EDS analysis shown in Table 6 indicates that an amount of F exists on the surface of anode, which should be the fluoride as the thin film attached to the surface of anode. The F1s spectra (Figure 5c) shows an enhanced intensity of LiF which supports this viewpoint. Besides that, the disappearance of C-O/C=O and C-C peaks indicates the complete decomposition of SEI layer. Compared to the black area, the yellow area demonstrates the existence of Al element which is the composition of ceramic coating for separator (Table 6). That is to say, the Al2O3 coating has been separated from the fragmentized substrates and adheres to the surface of anode. Cathode. The cell disassembly photo of cathode is shown in Figure 3e. As we can see, the active materials have been peeled off from aluminum current collector partly, which should be ascribed to the failure of binder. The SEM image has been taken for the active materials as Figure 3e-II shows. The LFP Journal Pre-proof particles with neat appearance are clearly visible. The P2p spectra (Figure 6c) shows the excellent thermal stability of P-O too. That is to say, because of the strong P-O covalent bond in PO4 3- tetrahedral structure, the LFP shows excellent thermal stability. Based on the above analysis, the evolution of TR process can be summarized as Figure 8 shows. As we can see, the SEI decomposition is the reason for self- heating. Besides that, the solvent co-intercalation results in the reaction between intercalated lithium and electrolytes, which produces a large amount of CO. The exposed lithium reacts with binders at higher temperature, which generates H2 and results in the early failure of binders at anode. The high temperature also destroys the porous structure of polyolefin substrate which blocks the transport channel of Li-ions. Then, the shrink of separator causes the massive-ISC of battery. And the decomposition/vaporation of electrolytes results in its inhomogeneous distribution on the surface of electrodes. Due to the partial discharge of the electrodes caused by these two reasons, the voltage fluctuates at around 0.3V. It takes a long time for the voltage to change below 0.1V after the sudden drop occurs. At last, the combustible materials burn down, and the wreckage remains. DISCUSSION This paper presents a comprehensive investigation in the evolution of TR for a 24 Ah prismatic battery consisting of LiFePO4/graphite under adiabatic condition. Four characteristic temperatures are calibrated by EV-ARC, which include the onset temperature for detectable self-heat generation (TSH), trigger temperature of TR (TTR), venting temperature (TV), and the maximum temperature (Tmax). The main innovation of this study is applying LNC technology to stop the exothermal reaction and investigate the internal mechanism of TR at each Journal Pre-proof characteristic temperature with the non-atmospheric exposure post-mortem technology. And the internal mechanism of TR for the battery was analyzed by the recorded external characteristic such as appearance, voltage, resistance. The research on gas release before venting is an important contribution of this study. It is found that the decomposition of SEI layer generates a lot of CO and the reaction between intercalated lithium and PVDF generates H2, which can work as the early warning signals to predict TR. And the CO is generated at lower temperatures than H2. The reaction between intercalated lithium and binders affects the appearance of anode greatly. The failure of PVDF binder results in the anode materials peeled off from copper current collector partly at TTR. As the temperature rises, the distribution of electrolytes caused by the volatilization of solvent will affect the morphology of electrodes deeply. The deposition/decomposition of LiPF6 is responsible for the membrane-like deposits on the surface of electrodes during TR process. Besides that, the lack of electrolyte can block the transport channel of lithium, which results in the tremendous growth of resistance and the partial discharge of electrodes. That’s the reason for continuous voltage fluctuation after its instant drop. Limitations of the Study Although predicting TR of LIBs by monitoring the gas release of CO and H2 is presented in this paper, the concentration threshold need be confirmed. Besides that, the experiment in this study based on the thermal abuse is conducted on adiabatic environment. Therefore, more trigger conditions should be taken into consideration to explore the mechanism of TR.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS The battery adopted in this investigation is a commercial prismatic lithium-ion battery with LFP as the cathode and graphite as the anode. The separator consists of polypropylene (PP) with ceramic coating. The specification of the lithium-ion cell is listed in table S1. METHOD DETAILS A commercial prismatic LFP battery was selected as the experimental subject in this study. The schematic illustration of experimental steps is depicted in detail as Figure S1 shows. In summary, the core works of this experiment are summarized as the pretreatment conducted by EV-ARC & LNC and non- atmospheric exposure post-mortem analysis, specifically as follows: firstly, four critical temperatures were recognized by EV-ARC to evaluate the thermal runaway performance of battery; secondly, the specimen heated to the corresponding temperature in EV-ARC was frozen by LNC technology; thirdly, the battery was disassembled in the glove box with the argon as the shielding gas; finally, the components were transferred from glovebox to next test by the vacuum transfer box. Heat-wait-search (H-W-S) tests The adiabatic calorimetric environment for thermal analysis was provided by EV-ARC which was manufactured by Thermal Hazard Technology (THT Co. Ltd.). The cell was charged to 100% SOC with a current of 0.5 C before ARC Journal Pre-proof experiment. The N-type thermocouple was placed on the central position of LIBs, which works as the sensor to feedback signals to EV-ARC. The experimental sequence is based on the H-W-S mode, where the heat step temperature is 5 ℃, followed by a wait time of 30 min. If the instrument detects the temperature-increase rate of the LIBs attaining to 0.02 ℃/min during the wait time, the program will identify that the test sample enters self-heating process (Figure S2). Then the program will shut down the heating and track the temperature change under an adiabatic condition. Liquid-nitrogen-ceased (LNC) thermal runaway test LNC TR test was conducted by liquid nitrogen spray. The EV-ARC was connected with a liquid nitrogen tank outside the chamber. During the LNC test, the temperature was monitored carefully. Once the temperature reached corresponding temperature, the liquid nitrogen would be injected into the chamber of EV-ARC to freeze the side reactions and stop the TR process. Combining LNC test with H-W-S test, the TR process of the cell could be ceased at any time so that non-atmospheric exposure post-mortem analysis could be conducted at characteristic temperatures. In this study, the specimens have been divided into five groups, including the fresh battery at Tamb (No. 1), the battery heated to TSH (No. 2), the battery heated to TTR (No. 3), the battery heated to TV (No. 4), and the battery heated to Tmax (No. 5). Non-atmospheric exposure post-mortem analysis The frozen cell was transferred into inert gas environments (MB 100, MBRAUN Ltd.) and dismantled to collect the battery components for subsequent analysis. The vacuum transfer box was applied to transfer the samples from glovebox to next test with non-atmospheric exposure. The microstructure of the samples was characterized using a JSM-7610FPLUS Scanning Electron Microscope- Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDS). The samples were also analyzed Journal Pre-proof by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha Surface Analysis). The compositions of the sampled gases were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent Technologies 5977B MSD). Journal Pre-proof Main Figure titles and legends Figure 1.
