{"path":"lit/lit_sources/HAI24AIIndexReport.pdf","text":"Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 2 Introduction to the AI Index Report 2024 Welcome to the seventh edition of the AI Index report. The 2024 Index is our most comprehensive to date and arrives at an important moment when AI’s influence on society has never been more pronounced. This year, we have broadened our scope to more extensively cover essential trends such as technical advancements in AI, public perceptions of the technology, and the geopolitical dynamics surrounding its development. Featuring more original data than ever before, this edition introduces new estimates on AI training costs, detailed analyses of the responsible AI landscape, and an entirely new chapter dedicated to AI’s impact on science and medicine. The AI Index report tracks, collates, distills, and visualizes data related to artificial intelligence (AI). Our mission is to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, broadly sourced data in order for policymakers, researchers, executives, journalists, and the general public to develop a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the complex field of AI. The AI Index is recognized globally as one of the most credible and authoritative sources for data and insights on artificial intelligence. Previous editions have been cited in major newspapers, including the The New York Times, Bloomberg, and The Guardian, have amassed hundreds of academic citations, and been referenced by high-level policymakers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, among other places. This year’s edition surpasses all previous ones in size, scale, and scope, reflecting the growing significance that AI is coming to hold in all of our lives. Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 3 Message From the Co-directors A decade ago, the best AI systems in the world were unable to classify objects in images at a human level. AI struggled with language comprehension and could not solve math problems. Today, AI systems routinely exceed human performance on standard benchmarks. Progress accelerated in 2023. New state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude 3 are impressively multimodal: They can generate fluent text in dozens of languages, process audio, and even explain memes. As AI has improved, it has increasingly forced its way into our lives. Companies are racing to build AI-based products, and AI is increasingly being used by the general public. But current AI technology still has significant problems. It cannot reliably deal with facts, perform complex reasoning, or explain its conclusions. AI faces two interrelated futures. First, technology continues to improve and is increasingly used, having major consequences for productivity and employment. It can be put to both good and bad uses. In the second future, the adoption of AI is constrained by the limitations of the technology. Regardless of which future unfolds, governments are increasingly concerned. They are stepping in to encourage the upside, such as funding university R&D and incentivizing private investment. Governments are also aiming to manage the potential downsides, such as impacts on employment, privacy concerns, misinformation, and intellectual property rights. As AI rapidly evolves, the AI Index aims to help the AI community, policymakers, business leaders, journalists, and the general public navigate this complex landscape. It provides ongoing, objective snapshots tracking several key areas: technical progress in AI capabilities, the community and investments driving AI development and deployment, public opinion on current and potential future impacts, and policy measures taken to stimulate AI innovation while managing its risks and challenges. By comprehensively monitoring the AI ecosystem, the Index serves as an important resource for understanding this transformative technological force. On the technical front, this year’s AI Index reports that the number of new large language models released worldwide in 2023 doubled over the previous year. Two-thirds were open-source, but the highest-performing models came from industry players with closed systems. Gemini Ultra became the first LLM to reach human- level performance on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark; performance on the benchmark has improved by 15 percentage points since last year. Additionally, GPT-4 achieved an impressive 0.96 mean win rate score on the comprehensive Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) benchmark, which includes MMLU among other evaluations. Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 4 Although global private investment in AI decreased for the second consecutive year, investment in generative AI skyrocketed. More Fortune 500 earnings calls mentioned AI than ever before, and new studies show that AI tangibly boosts worker productivity. On the policymaking front, global mentions of AI in legislative proceedings have never been higher. U.S. regulators passed more AI-related regulations in 2023 than ever before. Still, many expressed concerns about AI’s ability to generate deepfakes and impact elections. The public became more aware of AI, and studies suggest that they responded with nervousness. Ray Perrault and Jack Clark Co-directors, AI Index Message From the Co-directors (cont’d) Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 5 Top 10 Takeaways 1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning. 2. Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research. In 2023, industry produced 51 notable machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high. 3. Frontier models get way more expensive. According to AI Index estimates, the training costs of state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 used an estimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while Google’s Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute. 4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI models. In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European Union’s 21 and China’s 15. 5. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking. New research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting. Leading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top AI models. 6. Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in the generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds. 7. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. In 2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still, other studies caution that using AI without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance. 5 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 6 Top 10 Takeaways (cont’d) 8. Scientific progress accelerates even further, thanks to AI. In 2022, AI began to advance scientific discovery. 2023, however, saw the launch of even more significant science-related AI applications— from AlphaDev, which makes algorithmic sorting more efficient, to GNoME, which facilitates the process of materials discovery. 9. The number of AI regulations in the United States sharply increases. The number of AI- related regulations in the U.S. has risen significantly in the past year and over the last five years. In 2023, there were 25 AI-related regulations, up from just one in 2016. Last year alone, the total number of AI-related regulations grew by 56.3%. 10. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous. A survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness toward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests that 52% of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 37% in 2022.

Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research. In 2023, industry produced 51 notable machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high. 2. More foundation models and more open foundation models. In 2023, a total of 149 foundation models were released, more than double the amount released in 2022. Of these newly released models, 65.7% were open-source, compared to only 44.4% in 2022 and 33.3% in 2021. 3. Frontier models get way more expensive. According to AI Index estimates, the training costs of state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 used an estimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while Google’s Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute. 4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI models. In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European Union’s 21 and China’s 15. 5. The number of AI patents skyrockets. From 2021 to 2022, AI patent grants worldwide increased sharply by 62.7%. Since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times. 6. China dominates AI patents. In 2022, China led global AI patent origins with 61.1%, significantly outpacing the United States, which accounted for 20.9% of AI patent origins. Since 2010, the U.S. share of AI patents has decreased from 54.1%. 7. Open-source AI research explodes. Since 2011, the number of AI-related projects on GitHub has seen a consistent increase, growing from 845 in 2011 to approximately 1.8 million in 2023. Notably, there was a sharp 59.3% rise in the total number of GitHub AI projects in 2023 alone. The total number of stars for AI-related projects on GitHub also significantly increased in 2023, more than tripling from 4.0 million in 2022 to 12.2 million. 8. The number of AI publications continues to rise. Between 2010 and 2022, the total number of AI publications nearly tripled, rising from approximately 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 in 2022. The increase over the last year was a modest 1.1%. Report Highlights Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 15 Chapter 2: Technical Performance 1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning. 2. Here comes multimodal AI. Traditionally AI systems have been limited in scope, with language models excelling in text comprehension but faltering in image processing, and vice versa. However, recent advancements have led to the development of strong multimodal models, such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4. These models demonstrate flexibility and are capable of handling images and text and, in some instances, can even process audio. 3. Harder benchmarks emerge. AI models have reached performance saturation on established benchmarks such as ImageNet, SQuAD, and SuperGLUE, prompting researchers to develop more challenging ones. In 2023, several challenging new benchmarks emerged, including SWE-bench for coding, HEIM for image generation, MMMU for general reasoning, MoCa for moral reasoning, AgentBench for agent-based behavior, and HaluEval for hallucinations. 4. Better AI means better data which means … even better AI. New AI models such as SegmentAnything and Skoltech are being used to generate specialized data for tasks like image segmentation and 3D reconstruction. Data is vital for AI technical improvements. The use of AI to create more data enhances current capabilities and paves the way for future algorithmic improvements, especially on harder tasks. 5. Human evaluation is in. With generative models producing high-quality text, images, and more, benchmarking has slowly started shifting toward incorporating human evaluations like the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard rather than computerized rankings like ImageNet or SQuAD. Public sentiment about AI is becoming an increasingly important consideration in tracking AI progress. 6. Thanks to LLMs, robots have become more flexible. The fusion of language modeling with robotics has given rise to more flexible robotic systems like PaLM-E and RT-2. Beyond their improved robotic capabilities, these models can ask questions, which marks a significant step toward robots that can interact more effectively with the real world. Report Highlights Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 16 Chapter 2: Technical Performance (cont’d) 7. More technical research in agentic AI. Creating AI agents, systems capable of autonomous operation in specific environments, has long challenged computer scientists. However, emerging research suggests that the performance of autonomous AI agents is improving. Current agents can now master complex games like Minecraft and effectively tackle real-world tasks, such as online shopping and research assistance. 8. Closed LLMs significantly outperform open ones. On 10 select AI benchmarks, closed models outperformed open ones, with a median performance advantage of 24.2%. Differences in the performance of closed and open models carry important implications for AI policy debates. Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 17 Chapter 3: Responsible AI 1. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking. New research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting. Leading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top AI models. 2. Political deepfakes are easy to generate and difficult to detect. Political deepfakes are already affecting elections across the world, with recent research suggesting that existing AI deepfake methods perform with varying levels of accuracy. In addition, new projects like CounterCloud demonstrate how easily AI can create and disseminate fake content. 3. Researchers discover more complex vulnerabilities in LLMs. Previously, most efforts to red team AI models focused on testing adversarial prompts that intuitively made sense to humans. This year, researchers found less obvious strategies to get LLMs to exhibit harmful behavior, like asking the models to infinitely repeat random words. 4. Risks from AI are becoming a concern for businesses across the globe. A global survey on responsible AI highlights that companies’ top AI-related concerns include privacy, data security, and reliability. The survey shows that organizations are beginning to take steps to mitigate these risks. Globally, however, most companies have so far only mitigated a small portion of these risks. 5. LLMs can output copyrighted material. Multiple researchers have shown that the generative outputs of popular LLMs may contain copyrighted material, such as excerpts from The New York Times or scenes from movies. Whether such output constitutes copyright violations is becoming a central legal question. 6. AI developers score low on transparency, with consequences for research. The newly introduced Foundation Model Transparency Index shows that AI developers lack transparency, especially regarding the disclosure of training data and methodologies. This lack of openness hinders efforts to further understand the robustness and safety of AI systems. Report Highlights Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 18 Chapter 3: Responsible AI (cont’d) 7. Extreme AI risks are difficult to analyze. Over the past year, a substantial debate has emerged among AI scholars and practitioners regarding the focus on immediate model risks, like algorithmic discrimination, versus potential long-term existential threats. It has become challenging to distinguish which claims are scientifically founded and should inform policymaking. This difficulty is compounded by the tangible nature of already present short-term risks in contrast with the theoretical nature of existential threats. 8. The number of AI incidents continues to rise. According to the AI Incident Database, which tracks incidents related to the misuse of AI, 123 incidents were reported in 2023, a 32.3 percentage point increase from 2022. Since 2013, AI incidents have grown by over twentyfold. A notable example includes AI-generated, sexually explicit deepfakes of Taylor Swift that were widely shared online. 9. ChatGPT is politically biased. Researchers find a significant bias in ChatGPT toward Democrats in the United States and the Labour Party in the U.K. This finding raises concerns about the tool’s potential to influence users’ political views, particularly in a year marked by major global elections. Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 19 Chapter 4: Economy 1. Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in the generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds. 2. Already a leader, the United States pulls even further ahead in AI private investment. In 2023, the United States saw AI investments reach $67.2 billion, nearly 8.7 times more than China, the next highest investor. While private AI investment in China and the European Union, including the United Kingdom, declined by 44.2% and 14.1%, respectively, since 2022, the United States experienced a notable increase of 22.1% in the same time frame. 3. Fewer AI jobs in the United States and across the globe. In 2022, AI-related positions made up 2.0% of all job postings in America, a figure that decreased to 1.6% in 2023. This decline in AI job listings is attributed to fewer postings from leading AI firms and a reduced proportion of tech roles within these companies. 4. AI decreases costs and increases revenues. A new McKinsey survey reveals that 42% of surveyed organizations report cost reductions from implementing AI (including generative AI), and 59% report revenue increases. Compared to the previous year, there was a 10 percentage point increase in respondents reporting decreased costs, suggesting AI is driving significant business efficiency gains. 5. Total AI private investment declines again, while the number of newly funded AI companies increases. Global private AI investment has fallen for the second year in a row, though less than the sharp decrease from 2021 to 2022. The count of newly funded AI companies spiked to 1,812, up 40.6% from the previous year. 6. AI organizational adoption ticks up. A 2023 McKinsey report reveals that 55% of organizations now use AI (including generative AI) in at least one business unit or function, up from 50% in 2022 and 20% in 2017. 7. China dominates industrial robotics. Since surpassing Japan in 2013 as the leading installer of industrial robots, China has significantly widened the gap with the nearest competitor nation. In 2013, China’s installations accounted for 20.8% of the global total, a share that rose to 52.4% by 2022. Report Highlights Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 20 Chapter 4: Economy (cont’d) 8. Greater diversity in robot installations. In 2017, collaborative robots represented a mere 2.8% of all new industrial robot installations, a figure that climbed to 9.9% by 2022. Similarly, 2022 saw a rise in service robot installations across all application categories, except for medical robotics. This trend indicates not just an overall increase in robot installations but also a growing emphasis on deploying robots for human-facing roles. 9. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. In 2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still, other studies caution that using AI without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance. 10. Fortune 500 companies start talking a lot about AI, especially generative AI. In 2023, AI was mentioned in 394 earnings calls (nearly 80% of all Fortune 500 companies), a notable increase from 266 mentions in 2022. Since 2018, mentions of AI in Fortune 500 earnings calls have nearly doubled. The most frequently cited theme, appearing in 19.7% of all earnings calls, was generative AI. Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 21 Chapter 5: Science and Medicine 1. Scientific progress accelerates even further, thanks to AI. In 2022, AI began to advance scientific discovery. 2023, however, saw the launch of even more significant science-related AI applications— from AlphaDev, which makes algorithmic sorting more efficient, to GNoME, which facilitates the process of materials discovery. 2. AI helps medicine take significant strides forward. In 2023, several significant medical systems were launched, including EVEscape, which enhances pandemic prediction, and AlphaMissence, which assists in AI-driven mutation classification. AI is increasingly being utilized to propel medical advancements. 3. Highly knowledgeable medical AI has arrived. Over the past few years, AI systems have shown remarkable improvement on the MedQA benchmark, a key test for assessing AI’s clinical knowledge. The standout model of 2023, GPT-4 Medprompt, reached an accuracy rate of 90.2%, marking a 22.6 percentage point increase from the highest score in 2022. Since the benchmark’s introduction in 2019, AI performance on MedQA has nearly tripled. 4. The FDA approves more and more AI-related medical devices. In 2022, the FDA approved 139 AI-related medical devices, a 12.1% increase from 2021. Since 2012, the number of FDA-approved AI-related medical devices has increased by more than 45-fold. AI is increasingly being used for real-world medical purposes. Report Highlights Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 22 Chapter 6: Education 1. The number of American and Canadian CS bachelor’s graduates continues to rise, new CS master’s graduates stay relatively flat, and PhD graduates modestly grow. While the number of new American and Canadian bachelor’s graduates has consistently risen for more than a decade, the number of students opting for graduate education in CS has flattened. Since 2018, the number of CS master’s and PhD graduates has slightly declined. 2. The migration of AI PhDs to industry continues at an accelerating pace. In 2011, roughly equal percentages of new AI PhDs took jobs in industry (40.9%) and academia (41.6%). However, by 2022, a significantly larger proportion (70.7%) joined industry after graduation compared to those entering academia (20.0%). Over the past year alone, the share of industry-bound AI PhDs has risen by 5.3 percentage points, indicating an intensifying brain drain from universities into industry. 3. Less transition of academic talent from industry to academia. In 2019, 13% of new AI faculty in the United States and Canada were from industry. By 2021, this figure had declined to 11%, and in 2022, it further dropped to 7%. This trend indicates a progressively lower migration of high-level AI talent from industry into academia. 4. CS education in the United States and Canada becomes less international. Proportionally fewer international CS bachelor’s, master’s, and PhDs graduated in 2022 than in 2021. The drop in international students in the master’s category was especially pronounced. 5. More American high school students take CS courses, but access problems remain. In 2022, 201,000 AP CS exams were administered. Since 2007, the number of students taking these exams has increased more than tenfold. However, recent evidence indicates that students in larger high schools and those in suburban areas are more likely to have access to CS courses. 6. AI-related degree programs are on the rise internationally. The number of English-language, AI-related postsecondary degree programs has tripled since 2017, showing a steady annual increase over the past five years. Universities worldwide are offering more AI-focused degree programs. Report Highlights Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 23 Chapter 6: Education (cont’d) 7. The United Kingdom and Germany lead in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduate production. The United Kingdom and Germany lead Europe in producing the highest number of new informatics, CS, CE, and information bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD graduates. On a per capita basis, Finland leads in the production of both bachelor’s and PhD graduates, while Ireland leads in the production of master’s graduates. Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 24 Chapter 7: Policy and Governance 1. The number of AI regulations in the United States sharply increases. The number of AI-related regulations has risen significantly in the past year and over the last five years. In 2023, there were 25 AI-related regulations, up from just one in 2016. Last year alone, the total number of AI-related regulations grew by 56.3%. 2. The United States and the European Union advance landmark AI policy action. In 2023, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic put forth substantial proposals for advancing AI regulation The European Union reached a deal on the terms of the AI Act, a landmark piece of legislation enacted in 2024. Meanwhile, President Biden signed an Executive Order on AI, the most notable AI policy initiative in the United States that year. 3. AI captures U.S. policymaker attention. The year 2023 witnessed a remarkable increase in AI-related legislation at the federal level, with 181 bills proposed, more than double the 88 proposed in 2022. 4. Policymakers across the globe cannot stop talking about AI. Mentions of AI in legislative proceedings across the globe have nearly doubled, rising from 1,247 in 2022 to 2,175 in 2023. AI was mentioned in the legislative proceedings of 49 countries in 2023. Moreover, at least one country from every continent discussed AI in 2023, underscoring the truly global reach of AI policy discourse. 5. More regulatory agencies turn their attention toward AI. The number of U.S. regulatory agencies issuing AI regulations increased to 21 in 2023 from 17 in 2022, indicating a growing concern over AI regulation among a broader array of American regulatory bodies. Some of the new regulatory agencies that enacted AI- related regulations for the first time in 2023 include the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Report Highlights Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 25 Chapter 8: Diversity 1. U.S. and Canadian bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD CS students continue to grow more ethnically diverse. While white students continue to be the most represented ethnicity among new resident graduates at all three levels, the representation from other ethnic groups, such as Asian, Hispanic, and Black or African American students, continues to grow. For instance, since 2011, the proportion of Asian CS bachelor’s degree graduates has increased by 19.8 percentage points, and the proportion of Hispanic CS bachelor’s degree graduates has grown by 5.2 percentage points. 2. Substantial gender gaps persist in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduates at all educational levels. Every surveyed European country reported more male than female graduates in bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD programs for informatics, CS, CE, and IT. While the gender gaps have narrowed in most countries over the last decade, the rate of this narrowing has been slow. 3. U.S. K–12 CS education is growing more diverse, reflecting changes in both gender and ethnic representation. The proportion of AP CS exams taken by female students rose from 16.8% in 2007 to 30.5% in 2022. Similarly, the participation of Asian, Hispanic/Latino/Latina, and Black/African American students in AP CS has consistently increased year over year. Report Highlights Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 26 Chapter 9: Public Opinion 1. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous. A survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness toward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests that 52% of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 38% in 2022. 2. AI sentiment in Western nations continues to be low, but is slowly improving. In 2022, several developed Western nations, including Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the United States, were among the least positive about AI products and services. Since then, each of these countries has seen a rise in the proportion of respondents acknowledging the benefits of AI, with the Netherlands experiencing the most significant shift. 3. The public is pessimistic about AI’s economic impact. In an Ipsos survey, only 37% of respondents feel AI will improve their job. Only 34% anticipate AI will boost the economy, and 32% believe it will enhance the job market. 4. Demographic differences emerge regarding AI optimism. Significant demographic differences exist in perceptions of AI’s potential to enhance livelihoods, with younger generations generally more optimistic. For instance, 59% of Gen Z respondents believe AI will improve entertainment options, versus only 40% of baby boomers. Additionally, individuals with higher incomes and education levels are more optimistic about AI’s positive impacts on entertainment, health, and the economy than their lower-income and less-educated counterparts. 5. ChatGPT is widely known and widely used. An international survey from the University of Toronto suggests that 63% of respondents are aware of ChatGPT. Of those aware, around half report using ChatGPT at least once weekly.

It begins by examining trends in AI publications and patents, and then examines trends in notable AI systems and foundation models. It concludes by analyzing AI conference attendance and open-source AI software projects. Table of Contents 30 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 CHAPTER 1: Research and Development 1. Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research. In 2023, industry produced 51 notable machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high. 2. More foundation models and more open foundation models. In 2023, a total of 149 foundation models were released, more than double the amount released in 2022. Of these newly released models, 65.7% were open-source, compared to only 44.4% in 2022 and 33.3% in 2021. 3. Frontier models get way more expensive. According to AI Index estimates, the training costs of state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 used an estimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while Google’s Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute. 4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI models. In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European Union’s 21 and China’s 15. 5. The number of AI patents skyrockets. From 2021 to 2022, AI patent grants worldwide increased sharply by 62.7%. Since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times. 6. China dominates AI patents. In 2022, China led global AI patent origins with 61.1%, significantly outpacing the United States, which accounted for 20.9% of AI patent origins. Since 2010, the U.S. share of AI patents has decreased from 54.1%. 7. Open-source AI research explodes. Since 2011, the number of AI-related projects on GitHub has seen a consistent increase, growing from 845 in 2011 to approximately 1.8 million in 2023. Notably, there was a sharp 59.3% rise in the total number of GitHub AI projects in 2023 alone. The total number of stars for AI-related projects on GitHub also significantly increased in 2023, more than tripling from 4.0 million in 2022 to 12.2 million. 8. The number of AI publications continues to rise. Between 2010 and 2022, the total number of AI publications nearly tripled, rising from approximately 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 in 2022. The increase over the last year was a modest 1.1%.

Additionally, this section details publication data for AI journal articles and conference papers. 1.1 Publications Total Number of AI Publications1 Figure 1.1.1 displays the global count of AI publications. Between 2010 and 2022, the total number of AI publications nearly tripled, rising from approximately 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 in 2022. The increase over the last year was a modest 1.1%. 1 The data on publications presented this year is sourced from CSET. Both the methodology and data sources used by CSET to classify AI publications have changed since their data was last featured in the AI Index (2023). As a result, the numbers reported in this year’s section differ slightly from those reported in last year’s edition. Moreover, the AI-related publication data is fully available only up to 2022 due to a significant lag in updating publication data. Readers are advised to approach publication figures with appropriate caution. 1.1 Publications Chapter 1: Research and Development Figure 1.1.1 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 32 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1 PreviewTable of Contents 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 0 50 100 150 200Number of AI publications (in thousands) 0.05, Clinical trial 0.12, Other 0.57, Book 0.70, Dissertation 0.79, Unknown 1.49, Article 5.07, Preprint 12.88, Book chapter 41.17, Conference 232.67, Journal Number of AI publications by type, 2010–22 Source: Center for Security and Emerging Technology, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report By Type of Publication Figure 1.1.2 illustrates the distribution of AI publication types globally over time.

While many new AI models are introduced annually, only a small sample represents the most advanced research. Admittedly what constitutes advanced or frontier research is somewhat subjective. Frontier research could reflect a model posting a new state-of-the-art result on a benchmark, introducing a meaningful new architecture, or exercising some impressive new capabilities. The AI Index studies trends in two types of frontier AI models: “notable models” and foundation models.3 Epoch, an AI Index data provider, uses the term “notable machine learning models” to designate noteworthy models handpicked as being particularly influential within the AI/machine learning ecosystem. In contrast, foundation models are exceptionally large AI models trained on massive datasets, capable of performing a multitude of downstream tasks. Examples of foundation models include GPT-4, Claude 3, and Gemini. While many foundation models may qualify as notable models, not all notable models are foundation models. Within this section, the AI Index explores trends in notable models and foundation models from various perspectives, including originating organization, country of origin, parameter count, and compute usage. The analysis concludes with an examination of machine learning training costs. General Machine Learning Models Overview Epoch AI is a group of researchers dedicated to studying and predicting the evolution of advanced AI. They maintain a database of AI and machine learning models released since the 1950s, selecting 1.3 Frontier AI Research entries based on criteria such as state-of-the- art advancements, historical significance, or high citation rates. Analyzing these models provides a comprehensive overview of the machine learning landscape’s evolution, both in recent years and over the past few decades. 4 Some models may be missing from the dataset; however, the dataset can reveal trends in relative terms. 1.3 Frontier AI Research Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 3 “AI system” refers to a computer program or product based on AI, such as ChatGPT. “AI model” refers to a collection of parameters whose values are learned during training, such as GPT-4. 4 New and historic models are continually added to the Epoch database, so the total year-by-year counts of models included in this year’s AI Index might not exactly match those published in last year’s report. 46 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1 PreviewTable of Contents Sector Analysis Until 2014, academia led in the release of machine learning models. Since then, industry has taken the lead. In 2023, there were 51 notable machine learning models produced by industry compared to just 15 from academia (Figure 1.3.1). Significantly, 21 notable models resulted from industry/academic collaborations in 2023, a new high. Creating cutting-edge AI models now demands a substantial amount of data, computing power, and financial resources that are not available in academia.

Models trained on more data will usually have more parameters than those trained on less data. Likewise, models with more parameters typically outperform those with fewer parameters. Figure 1.3.5 demonstrates the parameter count of machine learning models in the Epoch dataset, categorized by the sector from which the models originate. Parameter counts have risen sharply since the early 2010s, reflecting the growing complexity of tasks AI models are designed for, the greater availability of data, improvements in hardware, and proven efficacy of larger models. High-parameter models are particularly notable in the industry sector, underscoring the capacity of companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google to bear the computational costs of training on vast volumes of data. 1.3 Frontier AI Research Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 100 10K 1M 100M 10B 1T Academia Academia-government Industry Industry–research collective Industry-academia Government Research collective Publication dateNumber of parameters (log scale) Number of parameters of notable machine learning models by sector, 2003–23 Source: Epoch, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 1.3.5 50 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1 PreviewTable of Contents Compute Trends The term “compute” in AI models denotes the computational resources required to train and operate a machine learning model. Generally, the complexity of the model and the size of the training dataset directly influence the amount of compute needed. The more complex a model is, and the larger the underlying training data, the greater the amount of compute required for training. Figure 1.3.6 visualizes the training compute required for notable machine learning models in the last 20 years. Recently, the compute usage of notable AI models has increased exponentially. 6 This trend has been especially pronounced in the last five years. This rapid rise in compute demand has critical implications. For instance, models requiring more computation often have larger environmental footprints, and companies typically have more access to computational resources than academic institutions. 1.3 Frontier AI Research Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0.01 1 100 10K 1M 100M 10B Academia Industry Academia-government Industry–research collective Government Industry-academia Research collective Publication dateTraining compute (petaFLOP - log scale) Training compute of notable machine learning models by sector, 2003–23 Source: Epoch, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 1.3.6 6 FLOP stands for “floating-point operation.” A floating-point operation is a single arithmetic operation involving floating-point numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The number of FLOPs a processor or computer can perform per second is an indicator of its computational power. The higher the FLOP rate, the more powerful the computer is. An AI model with a higher FLOP rate reflects its requirement for more computational resources during training. 51 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1 PreviewTable of Contents Figure 1.3.7 highlights the training compute of notable machine learning models since 2012. For example, AlexNet, one of the papers that popularized the now standard practice of using GPUs to improve AI models, required an estimated 470 petaFLOPs for training. The original Transformer, released in 2017, required around 7,400 petaFLOPs. Google’s Gemini Ultra, one of the current state-of-the-art foundation models, required 50 billion petaFLOPs. 1.3 Frontier AI Research Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Llama 2-70B PaLM (540B) Megatron-Turing NLG 530B GPT-3 175B (davinci) RoBERTa Large BERT-Large Transformer AlexNet Gemini Ultra Claude 2 GPT-4 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 1000 10K 100K 1M 10M 100M 1B 10B 100B Language Vision Multimodal Publication dateTraining compute (petaFLOP - log scale) Training compute of notable machine learning models by domain, 2012–23 Source: Epoch, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 1.3.7 52 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1 PreviewTable of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Will Models Run Out of Data? As illustrated above, a significant proportion of recent algorithmic progress, including progress behind powerful LLMs, has been achieved by training models on increasingly larger amounts of data. As noted recently by Anthropic cofounder and AI Index Steering Committee member Jack Clark, foundation models have been trained on meaningful percentages of all the data that has ever existed on the internet. The growing data dependency of AI models has led to concerns that future generations of computer scientists will run out of data to further scale and improve their systems. Research from Epoch suggests that these concerns are somewhat warranted. Epoch researchers have generated historical and compute-based projections for when AI researchers might expect to run out of data. The historical projections are based on observed growth rates in the sizes of data used to train foundation models. The compute projections adjust the historical growth rate based on projections of compute availability. For instance, the researchers estimate that computer scientists could deplete the stock of high-quality language data by 2024, exhaust low- quality language data within two decades, and use up image data by the late 2030s to mid-2040s (Figure 1.3.8). Theoretically, the challenge of limited data availability can be addressed by using synthetic data, which is data generated by AI models themselves. For example, it is possible to use text produced by one LLM to train another LLM. The use of synthetic data for training AI systems is particularly attractive, not only as a solution for potential data depletion but also because generative AI systems could, in principle, generate data in instances where naturally occurring data is sparse—for example, data for rare diseases or underrepresented populations. Until recently, the feasibility and effectiveness of using synthetic data for training generative AI systems were not well understood. However, research this year has suggested that there are limitations associated with training models on synthetic data. For instance, a team of British and Canadian researchers discovered that models predominantly trained on synthetic data experience model collapse, a phenomenon where, over time, they lose the ability to remember true underlying data distributions and start producing a narrow range of Highlight: Low-quality language stock High-quality language stock Image stock Stock type 2032.4 [2028.4; 2039.2] 2024.5 [2023.5; 2025.7] 2046 [2037; 2062.8] Historical projection 2040.5 [2034.6; 2048.9] 2024.1 [2023.2; 2025.3] 2038.8 [2032; 2049.8] Compute projection Projections of ML data exhaustion by stock type: median and 90% CI dates Source: Epoch, 2023 | Table: 2024 AI Index report 1.3 Frontier AI Research Chapter 1: Research and Development Figure 1.3.8 53 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1 PreviewTable of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Will Models Run Out of Data? (cont’d) outputs. Figure 1.3.9 demonstrates the process of model collapse in a variational autoencoder (VAE) model, a widely used generative AI architecture. With each subsequent generation trained on additional synthetic data, the model produces an increasingly limited set of outputs. As illustrated in Figure 1.3.10, in statistical terms, as the number of synthetic generations increases, the tails of the distributions vanish, and the generation density shifts toward the mean. 7 This pattern means that over time, the generations of models trained predominantly on synthetic data become less varied and are not as widely distributed. The authors demonstrate that this phenomenon occurs across various model types, including Gaussian Mixture Models and LLMs. This research underscores the continued importance of human- generated data for training capable LLMs that can produce a diverse array of content.

Models that have a higher generation density produce a wider range of higher-quality outputs. Models with low generation density produce a narrower range of more simplistic outputs. 54 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1 PreviewTable of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Will Models Run Out of Data? (cont’d) In a similar study published in 2023 on the use of synthetic data in generative imaging models, researchers found that generative image models trained solely on synthetic data cycles—or with insufficient real human data—experience a significant drop in output quality. The authors label this phenomenon Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), in reference to mad cow disease. The study examines two types of training processes: fully synthetic, where models are trained exclusively on synthetic data, and synthetic augmentation, where models are trained on a mix of synthetic and real data. In both scenarios, as the number of training generations increases, the quality of the generated images declines. Figure 1.3.11 highlights the degraded image generations of models that are augmented with synthetic data; for example, the faces generated in steps 7 and 9 increasingly display strange-looking hash marks. From a statistical perspective, images generated with both synthetic data and synthetic augmentation loops have higher FID scores (indicating less similarity to real images), lower precision scores (signifying reduced realism or quality), and lower recall scores (suggesting decreased diversity) (Figure 1.3.12). While synthetic augmentation loops, which incorporate some real data, show less degradation than fully synthetic loops, both methods exhibit diminishing returns with further training.

Trained on vast datasets, they are versatile and suitable for numerous downstream applications. Foundation models such as GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 2 showcase remarkable abilities and are increasingly being deployed in real- world scenarios. Introduced in 2023, the Ecosystem Graphs is a new community resource from Stanford that tracks the foundation model ecosystem, including datasets, models, and applications. This section uses data from the Ecosystem Graphs to study trends in foundation models over time. 8 Model Release Foundation models can be accessed in different ways. No access models, like Google’s PaLM-E, are only accessible to their developers. Limited access models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4, offer limited access to the models, often through a public API. Open models, like Meta’s Llama 2, fully release model weights, which means the models can be modified and freely used. Figure 1.3.13 visualizes the total number of foundation models by access type since 2019. In recent years, the number of foundation models has risen sharply, more than doubling since 2022 and growing by a factor of nearly 38 since 2019. Of the 149 foundation models released in 2023, 98 were open, 23 limited and 28 no access. 1.3 Frontier AI Research Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 8 The Ecosystem Graphs make efforts to survey the global AI ecosystem, but it is possible that they underreport models from certain nations like South Korea and China. 10 28 28 12 23 9 32 98 4 2 27 72 149 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Open Limited No accessFoundation models Foundation models by access type, 2019–23 Source: Bommasani et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 1.3.13 57 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1 PreviewTable of Contents In 2023, the majority of foundation models were released as open access (65.8%), with 18.8% having no access and 15.4% limited access (Figure 1.3.14).

While AI companies seldom reveal the expenses involved in training their models, it is widely believed that these costs run into millions of dollars and are rising. For instance, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, mentioned that the training cost for GPT-4 was over $100 million. This escalation in training expenses has effectively excluded universities, traditionally centers of AI research, from developing their own leading-edge foundation models. In response, policy initiatives, such as President Biden’s Executive Order on AI, have sought to level the playing field between industry and academia by creating a National AI Research Resource, which would grant nonindustry actors the compute and data needed to do higher level AI-research. Understanding the cost of training AI models is important, yet detailed information on these costs remains scarce. The AI Index was among the first to offer estimates on the training costs of foundation models in last year’s publication. This year, the AI Index has collaborated with Epoch AI, an AI research institute, to substantially enhance and solidify the robustness of its AI training cost estimates. 9 To estimate the cost of cutting-edge models, the Epoch team analyzed training duration, as well as the type, quantity, and utilization rate of the training hardware, using information from publications, press releases, or technical reports related to the models. 10 Figure 1.3.21 visualizes the estimated training cost associated with select AI models, based on cloud compute rental prices. AI Index estimates validate suspicions that in recent years model training costs have significantly increased. For example, in 2017, the original Transformer model, which introduced the architecture that underpins virtually every modern LLM, cost around $900 to train. 11 RoBERTa Large, released in 2019, which achieved state-of-the-art results on many canonical comprehension benchmarks like SQuAD and GLUE, cost around $160,000 to train. Fast-forward to 2023, and training costs for OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini Ultra are estimated to be around $78 million and $191 million, respectively. 1.3 Frontier AI Research Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 9 Ben Cottier and Robi Rahman led research at Epoch AI into model training cost. 10 A detailed description of the estimation methodology is provided in the Appendix. 11 The cost figures reported in this section are inflation-adjusted. 64 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1 PreviewTable of Contents 930 3,288 160,018 4,324,883 6,405,653 1,319,586 12,389,056 78,352,034 3,931,897 191,400,000TransformerBERT-LargeRoBERTa LargeGPT-3 175B (davinci)Megatron-Turing NLG 530BLaMDAPaLM (540B)GPT-4Llama 2 70BGemini Ultra 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 50M 100M 150M 200MTraining cost (in U.S. dollars) Estimated training cost of select AI models, 2017–23 Source: Epoch, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Gemini Ultra Falcon 180B StarCoder GPT-4 LLaMA-65B Llama 2 70B BLOOM-176B PaLI Imagen Flamingo PaLM (540B) T0-XXL HyperCLOVA Meta Pseudo Labels Switch GPT-3 175B (davinci) AlphaStar Megatron-BERT RoBERTa Large SciBERT BERT-Large BigGAN-deep 512×512 Big Transformer for Back-Translation IMPALA JFT Transformer Xception GNMT 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 100 1000 10K 100K 1M 10M 100M Publication dateTraining cost (in U.S. dollars - log scale) Estimated training cost of select AI models, 2016–23 Source: Epoch, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 1.3 Frontier AI Research Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 1.3.21 Figure 1.3.22 Figure 1.3.22 visualizes the training cost of all AI models for which the AI Index has estimates.

Widely used by software developers, GitHub facilitates code management, project collaboration, and open-source software support. This section draws on data from GitHub providing insights into broader trends in open-source AI software development not reflected in academic publication data. Projects A GitHub project comprises a collection of files, including source code, documentation, configuration files, and images, that together make up a software project. Figure 1.5.1 looks at the total number of 1.5 Open-Source AI Software GitHub AI projects over time. Since 2011, the number of AI-related GitHub projects has seen a consistent increase, growing from 845 in 2011 to approximately 1.8 million in 2023. 13 Notably, there was a sharp 59.3% rise in the total number of GitHub AI projects in the last year alone. 1.5 Open-Source AI Software Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 13 GitHub’s methodology for identifying AI-related projects has evolved over the past year. For classifying AI projects, GitHub has started incorporating generative AI keywords from a recently published research paper, a shift from the previously detailed methodology in an earlier paper. This edition of the AI Index is the first to adopt this updated approach. Moreover, the previous edition of the AI Index utilized country-level mapping of GitHub AI projects conducted by the OECD, which depended on self-reported data—a method experiencing a decline in coverage over time. This year, the AI Index has adopted geographic mapping from GitHub, leveraging server-side data for broader coverage. Consequently, the data presented here may not align perfectly with data in earlier versions of the report. 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50Number of AI projects (in millions) 1.81 Number of GitHub AI projects, 2011–23 Source: GitHub, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 1.5.1 70 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1 PreviewTable of Contents Figure 1.5.2 reports GitHub AI projects by geographic area since 2011.

Among the most starred repositories are libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, Keras, and PyTorch, which enjoy widespread popularity among software developers in the AI coding community. For example, TensorFlow is a popular library for building and deploying machine learning models. OpenCV is a platform that offers a variety of tools for computer vision, such as object detection and feature extraction. The total number of stars for AI-related projects on GitHub saw a significant increase in the last year, more than tripling from 4.0 million in 2022 to 12.2 million in 2023 (Figure 1.5.3). This sharp increase in GitHub stars, along with the previously reported rise in projects, underscores the accelerating growth of open-source AI software development. 1.5 Open-Source AI Software Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 2 4 6 8 10 12Number of GitHub stars (in millions) 12.21 Number of GitHub stars in AI projects, 2011–23 Source: GitHub, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 1.5.3 72 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1 PreviewTable of Contents In 2023, the United States led in receiving the highest number of GitHub stars, totaling 10.5 million (Figure 1.5.4).

It starts with a high-level overview of AI technical performance, tracing its broad evolution over time. The chapter then examines the current state of a wide range of AI capabilities, including language processing, coding, computer vision (image and video analysis), reasoning, audio processing, autonomous agents, robotics, and reinforcement learning. It also shines a spotlight on notable AI research breakthroughs from the past year, exploring methods for improving LLMs through prompting, optimization, and fine-tuning, and wraps up with an exploration of AI systems’ environmental footprint. CHAPTER 2: Technical Performance Table of Contents 77 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning. 2. Here comes multimodal AI. Traditionally AI systems have been limited in scope, with language models excelling in text comprehension but faltering in image processing, and vice versa. However, recent advancements have led to the development of strong multimodal models, such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4. These models demonstrate flexibility and are capable of handling images and text and, in some instances, can even process audio. 3. Harder benchmarks emerge. AI models have reached performance saturation on established benchmarks such as ImageNet, SQuAD, and SuperGLUE, prompting researchers to develop more challenging ones. In 2023, several challenging new benchmarks emerged, including SWE-bench for coding, HEIM for image generation, MMMU for general reasoning, MoCa for moral reasoning, AgentBench for agent-based behavior, and HaluEval for hallucinations. 4. Better AI means better data which means … even better AI. New AI models such as SegmentAnything and Skoltech are being used to generate specialized data for tasks like image segmentation and 3D reconstruction. Data is vital for AI technical improvements. The use of AI to create more data enhances current capabilities and paves the way for future algorithmic improvements, especially on harder tasks. 5. Human evaluation is in. With generative models producing high-quality text, images, and more, benchmarking has slowly started shifting toward incorporating human evaluations like the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard rather than computerized rankings like ImageNet or SQuAD. Public feeling about AI is becoming an increasingly important consideration in tracking AI progress. 6. Thanks to LLMs, robots have become more flexible. The fusion of language modeling with robotics has given rise to more flexible robotic systems like PaLM-E and RT-2. Beyond their improved robotic capabilities, these models can ask questions, which marks a significant step toward robots that can interact more effectively with the real world. 7. More technical research in agentic AI. Creating AI agents, systems capable of autonomous operation in specific environments, has long challenged computer scientists. However, emerging research suggests that the performance of autonomous AI agents is improving. Current agents can now master complex games like Minecraft and effectively tackle real-world tasks, such as online shopping and research assistance. 8. Closed LLMs significantly outperform open ones. On 10 select AI benchmarks, closed models outperformed open ones, with a median performance advantage of 24.2%. Differences in the performance of closed and open models carry important implications for AI policy debates.

Figure 2.1.16 illustrates the progress of AI systems relative to human baselines for nine AI benchmarks corresponding to nine tasks (e.g., image classification or basic-level reading comprehension). 1 The AI Index team selected one benchmark to represent each task. Over the years, AI has surpassed human baselines on a handful of benchmarks, such as image classification in 2015, basic reading comprehension in 2017, visual reasoning in 2020, and natural language inference in 2021. As of 2023, there are still some task categories where AI fails to exceed human ability. These tend to be more complex cognitive tasks, such as visual commonsense reasoning and advanced-level mathematical problem-solving (competition-level math problems). 1 An AI benchmark is a standardized test used to evaluate the performance and capabilities of AI systems on specific tasks. For example, ImageNet is a canonical AI benchmark that features a large collection of labeled images, and AI systems are tasked with classifying these images accurately. Tracking progress on benchmarks has been a standard way for the AI community to monitor the advancement of AI systems. 2 In Figure 2.1.16, the values are scaled to establish a standard metric for comparing different benchmarks. The scaling function is calibrated such that the performance of the best model for each year is measured as a percentage of the human baseline for a given task. A value of 105% indicates, for example, that a model performs 5% better than the human baseline. 2.1 Overview of AI in 2023 82 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2: Technical Performance Abductive Natural Language Inference (aNLI) arXiv Cityscapes Challenge ImageNet Kinetics-400 Kinetics-600 Kinetics-700 Kvasir-SEG MPII PubMed SST-5 Fine-Grained Classication STL-10 SuperGLUE Visual Question Answering Challenge (VQA) VoxCeleb Benchmark Natural language inference Text summarization Semantic segmentation Image classication Activity recognition Activity recognition Activity recognition Medical image segmentation Human pose estimation Text summarization Sentiment analysis Image generation English language understanding Visual reasoning Speech recognition Task category 2019 2003 2016 2009 2017 2018 2019 2019 2014 2008 2013 2011 2019 2017 2017 Year introduced NA NA 0.23% 1.54% NA NA NA 1.90% NA NA NA NA NA NA NA Improvement from 2022 A selection of deprecated benchmarks from the 2023 AI Index report Source: AI Index, 2024 Figure 2.1.17 AI Index Benchmarks An emerging theme in AI technical performance, as emphasized in last year’s report, is the observed saturation on many benchmarks, such as ImageNet, used to assess the proficiency of AI models. Performance on these benchmarks has stagnated in recent years, indicating either a plateau in AI capabilities or a shift among researchers toward more complex research challenges.3 Due to saturation, several benchmarks featured in the 2023 AI Index have been omitted from this year’s report. Figure 2.1.17 highlights a selection of benchmarks that were included in the 2023 edition but not featured in this year’s report.4 It also shows the improvement on these benchmarks since 2022. “NA” indicates no improvement was noted. 3 Benchmarks can also saturate or see limited improvement because the problem created is hard and the corresponding performance fails to improve. The issue of benchmark saturation discussed in this section refers more to benchmarks where performance reaches a close-to-perfection level on which it is difficult to improve. 4 For brevity, Figure 2.1.17 highlights a selection of deprecated benchmarks. Additional benchmarks that were deprecated either because there was saturation, no new state-of-the-art score was documented, or research focus shifted away from the benchmark include: Celeb-DF (deepfake detection), CIFAR-10 (image classification), NIST FRVT (facial recognition), and Procgen (reinforcement learning). 2.1 Overview of AI in 2023 83 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2: Technical Performance 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25%Year-over-year improvement (%) 0.11%, SuperGLUE 0.23%, Cityscapes 1.54%, ImageNet Top 1 1.84%, VQA 3.02%, COCO 4.47%, Kinetics-400 Year-over-year improvement over time on select AI Index technical performance benchmarks Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 2.1.18 Figure 2.1.18 illustrates the year-over-year improvement, in percent, on a selection of benchmarks featured in the 2023 AI Index report.

The 2024 AI Index tracks progress on several new benchmarks including those for tasks in coding, advanced reasoning, and agentic behavior—areas that were underrepresented in previous versions of the report (Figure 2.1.19).5 5 This report includes an Appendix with details regarding the sourcing of new benchmarks featured in this chapter. 2.1 Overview of AI in 2023 85 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents Natural language processing (NLP) enables computers to understand, interpret, generate, and transform text. Current state- of-the-art models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini, are able to generate fluent and coherent prose and display high levels of language understanding ability (Figure 2.2.1). Many of these models can also now handle different input forms, such as images and audio (Figure 2.2.2). 2.2 Language 2.2 Language Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 A sample output from GPT-4 Source: AI Index, 2024 Figure 2.2.1 Figure 2.2.2 Gemini handling image and audio inputs Source: Google, 2024 86 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents Understanding English language understanding challenges AI systems to understand the English language in various ways such as reading comprehension and logical reasoning. HELM: Holistic Evaluation of Language Models As illustrated above, in recent years LLMs have surpassed human performance on traditional English- language benchmarks, such as SQuAD (question answering) and SuperGLUE (language understanding). This rapid advancement has led to the need for more comprehensive benchmarks. In 2022, Stanford researchers introduced HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models), designed to evaluate LLMs across diverse scenarios, including reading comprehension, language understanding, and mathematical reasoning. 6 HELM assesses models from several leading companies like Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI, and uses a “mean win rate” to track average performance across all scenarios. As of January 2024, GPT-4 leads the aggregate HELM leaderboard with a mean win rate of 0.96 (Figure 2.2.3); however, different models top different task categories (Figure 2.2.4). 7 Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 0.96 0.83 0.82 0.78 0.78 0.77 0.73 0.72 0.69 0.68GPT-4 (0613)GPT-4 Turbo (1106 preview)Palmyra X V3 (72B)Palmyra X V2 (33B)PaLM-2 (Unicorn)Yi (34B)Mixtral (8×7B 32K seqlen)Anthropic Claude v1.3PaLM-2 (Bison)Anthropic Claude 2.00.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00Mean win rate HELM: mean win rate Source: CRFM, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report GSM8K - EM LegalBench - EM MATH - Equivalent (CoT) MMLU - EM MedQA - EM NarrativeQA - F1 NaturalQuestions (closed-book) - F1 NaturalQuestions (open-book) - F1 OpenbookQA - EM WMT 2014 - BLEU-4 Task GPT-4 (0613) GPT-4 (0613) GPT-4 Turbo (1106 preview) GPT-4 (0613) GPT-4 Turbo (1106 preview) Yi (34B) Llama 2 (70B) PaLM-2 (Bison) GPT-4 (0613) Palmyra X V3 (72B) Leading model 0.93 0.71 0.86 0.74 0.82 0.78 0.46 0.81 0.96 0.26 Score Leaders on individual HELM sub-benchmarks Source: CRFM, 2023 | Table: 2024 AI Index report Figure 2.2.3 Figure 2.2.4 6 HELM evaluates 10 scenarios: (1) NarrativeQA (reading comprehension), (2) Natural Questions (closed-book) (closed-book short-answer question answering), (3) Natural Questions (open-book) (open-book short-answer question answering), (4) OpenBookQA (commonsense question answering), (5) MMLU (multisubject understanding), (6) GSM8K (grade school math), (7) MATH (competition math), (8) LegalBench (legal reasoning), (9) MedQA (medical knowledge), and (10) WMT 2014 (machine translation). 7 There are several versions of HELM.

Chatbot Arena Leaderboard The rise of capable LLMs has made it increasingly important to understand which models are preferred by the general public. Launched in 2023, the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard is one of the first comprehensive evaluations of public LLM preference. The leaderboard allows users to query two anonymous models and vote for the preferred generations (Figure 2.2.7). As of early 2024, the platform has garnered over 200,000 votes, and users ranked OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo as the most preferred model (Figure 2.2.8).

The presence of real-world instances where LLMs have produced hallucinations—in court cases, for example—underscores the growing necessity of closely monitoring trends in LLM factuality. TruthfulQA Introduced at ACL 2022, TruthfulQA is a benchmark designed to evaluate the truthfulness of LLMs in generating answers to questions. This benchmark comprises approximately 800 questions across 38 categories, including health, politics, and finance. Many questions are crafted to challenge commonly held misconceptions, which typically lead humans to answer incorrectly (Figure 2.2.9). Although one of the observations of the paper is that larger models tend to be less truthful, GPT-4 (RLHF) released in early 2024, has achieved the highest performance thus far on the TruthfulQA benchmark, with a score of 0.6 (Figure 2.2.10). This score is nearly three times higher than that of a GPT-2-based model tested in 2021, indicating that LLMs are becoming progressively better at providing truthful answers.

While existing research has aimed to understand the causes of hallucinations, less effort has been directed toward assessing the frequency of LLM hallucinations and identifying specific content areas where they are especially vulnerable. HaluEval, introduced in 2023, is a new benchmark designed to assess hallucinations in LLMs. It includes over 35,000 samples, both hallucinated and normal, for analysis and evaluation by LLMs (Figure 2.2.11). The research indicates that ChatGPT fabricates unverifiable information in approximately 19.5% of its responses, with these fabrications spanning a variety of topics such as language, climate, and technology. Furthermore, the study examines how well current LLMs can detect hallucinations. Figure 2.2.12 illustrates the performance of leading LLMs in identifying hallucinations across various tasks, including question answering, knowledge-grounded dialogue, and text summarization. The findings reveal that many LLMs struggle with these tasks, highlighting that hallucination is a significant ongoing issue.

In October 2023, researchers introduced SWE-bench, a dataset comprising 2,294 software engineering problems sourced from real GitHub issues and popular Python repositories (Figure 2.3.3). SWE-bench presents a tougher test for AI coding proficiency, demanding that systems coordinate changes across multiple functions, interact with various execution environments, and perform complex reasoning. Even state-of-the-art LLMs face significant challenges with SWE-bench. Claude 2, the best-performing model, solved only 4.8% of the dataset’s problems (Figure 2.3.4).8 In 2023, the top- performing model on SWE-bench surpassed the best model from 2022 by 4.3 percentage points.

In 2023, Stanford researchers introduced the Holistic Evaluation of Text-to- Image Models (HEIM), a benchmark designed to comprehensively assess image generators across 12 key aspects crucial for real-world deployment, such as image-text alignment, image quality, and aesthetics. 9 Human evaluators are used to rate the models, a crucial feature since many automated metrics struggle to accurately assess various aspects of images. HEIM’s findings indicate that no single model excels in all criteria. For human evaluation of image-to-text alignment (assessing how well the generated image matches the input text), OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 scores highest (Figure 2.4.3). In terms of image quality (gauging if the images resemble real photographs), aesthetics (evaluating the visual appeal), and originality (a measure of novel image generation and avoidance of copyright infringement), the Stable Diffusion–based Dreamlike Photoreal model ranks highest (Figure 2.4.4). Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 9 The 12 evaluation aspects of HEIM are: (1) Alignment: How closely does the image align with the given text? (2) Quality: What is the quality of the produced image? (3) Aesthetic: How aesthetically pleasing is the generated image? (4) Originality: How original is the image? (5) Reasoning: Does the model understand objects, counts, and spatial relations? (6) Knowledge: Does the model have knowledge about the world? (7) Bias: Are the generated images biased? (8) Toxicity: Are the generated images toxic or inappropriate? (9) Fairness: Do the generated images exhibit performance disparities? (10) Robust: Is the model robust to input perturbations? (11) Multilinguality: Does the model support non-English languages? (12) Efficiency: How fast is model inference?

EditVal Despite the promise of text-guided image editing, few robust methods can evaluate how accurately AI image editors adhere to editing prompts. EditVal, a new benchmark for assessing text-guided image editing, includes over 13 edit types, such as adding objects or changing their positions, across 19 object classes (Figure 2.4.10). The benchmark was applied to evaluate eight leading text-guided image editing methods including SINE and Null-text. Performance improvements since 2021 on a variety of the benchmark’s editing tasks, are shown in Figure 2.4.11.

Existing text-to-image models often lack precise control over the spatial composition of an image, making it difficult to use prompts alone to generate images with complex layouts, diverse shapes, and specific poses. Fine-tuning these models for greater compositional control by training them on additional images is theoretically feasible, but many specialized datasets, such as those for human poses, are not large enough to support successful training. In 2023, researchers from Stanford introduced a new model, ControlNet, that improves conditional control editing for large text- to-image diffusion models (Figure 2.4.12). ControlNet stands out for its ability to handle various conditioning inputs. Compared to other previously released models in 2022, human raters prefer ControlNet both in terms of superior quality and better condition fidelity (Figure 2.4.13). The introduction of ControlNet is a significant step toward creating advanced text- to-image generators capable of editing images to more accurately replicate the complex images frequently encountered in the real world.

SAM is remarkable for being one of the first broadly generalizable segmentation models that performs well zero-shot on new tasks and distributions. Segment Anything outperforms leading segmentation methods like RITM on 16 out of 23 segmentation datasets (Figure 2.4.17). The metric on which Segment Anything is evaluated is the mean Intersection over Union (IoU). Meta’s Segment Anything model was then used, alongside human annotators, to create the SA-1B dataset, which included over 1 billion segmentation masks across 11 million images (Figure 2.4.16).

As part of a general reasoning challenge, for example, an AI system might be asked to reason across multiple subjects rather than perform one narrow task (e.g., playing chess). MMMU: A Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Expert AGI In recent years, the reasoning abilities of AI systems have advanced so much that traditional benchmarks like SQuAD (for textual reasoning) and VQA (for visual reasoning) have become saturated, indicating a need for more challenging reasoning tests. Responding to this, researchers from the United States and Canada recently developed MMMU, the Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Expert AGI. MMMU comprises about 11,500 college-level questions from six core disciplines: art and design, business, science, health and medicine, humanities and social science, and technology and engineering (Figure 2.6.1). The question formats include charts, maps, tables, chemical structures, and more. MMMU is one of the most demanding tests of perception, knowledge, and reasoning in AI to date. As of January 2024, the highest performing model is Gemini Ultra, which leads in all subject categories with an overall score of 59.4% (Figure 2.6.2). 11 On most individual task categories, top models are still well beyond medium-level human experts (Figure 2.6.3). This relatively low score is evidence of MMMU’s effectiveness as a benchmark for assessing AI reasoning capabilities. 2.6 Reasoning 2.6 Reasoning Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Reasoning in AI involves the ability of AI systems to draw logically valid conclusions from different forms of information. AI systems are increasingly being tested in diverse reasoning contexts, including visual (reasoning about images), moral (understanding moral dilemmas), and social reasoning (navigating social situations). 10 10 Some abilities highlighted in the previous sections implicitly involve some form of reasoning. This section highlights tasks that have a more specific reasoning focus. 11 The AI Index reports results from the MMMU validation set, as recommended by the paper authors for the most comprehensive coverage. According to the authors, the test set, with its unreleased labels and larger size, presents a more challenging yet unbiased benchmark for model performance, ensuring a more robust evaluation.

Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) Introduced in 2019, the Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) challenge tests the commonsense visual reasoning abilities of AI systems. In this challenge, AI systems not only answer questions based on images but also reason about the logic behind their answers (Figure 2.6.13). Performance in VCR is measured using the Q->AR score, which evaluates the machine’s ability to both select the correct answer to a question (Q->A) and choose the appropriate rationale behind that answer (Q->R). While AI systems have yet to outperform humans on this task, their capabilities are steadily improving.

Therefore, it is essential for AI systems to possess robust moral reasoning capabilities, enabling them to effectively navigate and reason about ethical principles and moral considerations. MoCa The ability of AI models to reason in linguistic and visual domains is well established, yet their capacity for moral reasoning, especially moral reasoning that aligns with human moral judgments, is less understood. 14 To further explore this topic, a team of Stanford researchers created a new dataset (MoCa) of human stories with moral elements (Figure 2.6.15). The researchers then presented these models with stories of human actions and prompted the models to respond, measuring moral agreement with the discrete agreement metric: A higher score indicates closer alignment with human moral judgment. The study yielded intriguing results. No model perfectly matches human moral systems, but newer, larger models like GPT-4 and Claude show greater alignment with human moral sentiments than smaller models like GPT-3, suggesting that as AI models scale, they are gradually becoming more morally aligned with humans. Of all models surveyed, GPT-4 showed the greatest agreement with human moral sentiments (Figure 2.6.16). 2.6 Reasoning Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 A moral story from MoCa Source: Nie et al., 2023 Figure 2.6.15 14 The topic of AI and moral alignment is contentious, as there are no universally agreed-upon moral principles.

As AI becomes increasingly ubiquitous, it has become important to evaluate whether AI models can not only explain their outputs but also update their conclusions—key aspects of causal reasoning. BigToM Assessing whether LLMs have theory-of-mind (ToM) capabilities—understanding and attributing mental states such as beliefs, intentions, and emotions—has traditionally challenged AI researchers. Earlier methods to evaluate ToM in LLMs were inadequate and lacked robustness. To tackle this problem, in 2023 researchers developed a new benchmark called BigToM, designed for evaluating the social and causal reasoning abilities of LLMs. BigToM, comprising 25 controls and 5,000 model-generated evaluations, has been rated by human evaluators as superior to existing ToM benchmarks. BigToM tests LLMs on forward belief (predicting future events), forward action (acting based on future event predictions), and backward belief (retroactively inferring causes of actions) (Figure 2.6.17). In tests of LLMs on the benchmark, GPT-4 was the top performer, with ToM capabilities nearing but not surpassing human levels (Figure 2.6.18, Figure 2.6.19, and Figure 2.6.20). More specifically, as measured by accuracy in correctly inferring beliefs, GPT-4 closely matched human performance in forward belief and backward belief tasks and slightly surpassed humans in forward action tasks. Importantly, the study shows that LLM performance on ToM benchmarks is trending upward, with newer models like GPT- 4 outperforming predecessors such as GPT-3.5 (released in 2022). 2.6 Reasoning Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Sample BigToM scenario Source: Gandhi et al., 2023 Figure 2.6.17 125 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents 2.6 Reasoning Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 96% 97% 76% 93% 96% 98% 99% 29% 20% 46% 73% 47% 90% 42%text-davinci-003GPT-3.5-turboLLaMA-65Human performanceClaude-2GPT-4-0314Claude 2022 2023 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% TB TB∧FBAccuracy (%) Forward action inference with initial belief: accuracy Source: Gandhi et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 27% 35% 43% 55% 62% 91% 99% 25% 31% 41% 52% 59% 90% 98%text-davinci-003GPT-3.5-turboLLaMA-65Claude-2ClaudeGPT-4-0314Human performance 2022 2023 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% TB TB∧FBAccuracy (%) Forward belief inference with initial belief: accuracy Source: Gandhi et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 10% 12% 29% 30% 35% 62% 81% 7% 9% 15% 24% 34% 40% 73%GPT-3.5-turbotext-davinci-003ClaudeClaude-2LLaMA-65GPT-4-0314Human performance 2022 2023 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% TB TB∧FBAccuracy (%) Backward belief inference with initial belief: accuracy Source: Gandhi et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 2.6.18 Figure 2.6.20 Figure 2.6.19 126 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Tübingen Cause-Effect Pairs Researchers from Microsoft and the University of Chicago have demonstrated that LLMs are effective causal reasoners.

UniAudio is capable of generating high-quality speech, sound, and music. UniAudio surpasses leading methods in tasks, including text-to-speech, speech enhancement, and voice conversion (Figure 2.7.1). With 1 billion parameters and trained on 165,000 hours of audio, UniAudio exemplifies the efficacy of big data and self-supervision for music generation. 129 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 MusicGEN and MusicLM Meta’s MusicGen is a novel audio generation model that also leverages the transformer architecture common in language models to generate audio. MusicGen enables users to specify text for a desired audio outcome and then fine-tune it using specific melodies. In comparative studies, MusicGen outshines other popular text-to-music models like Riffusion, Moûsai, and MusicLM across various generative music metrics. It boasts a lower FAD score, indicating more plausible music generation, a lower KL score for better alignment with reference music, and a higher CLAP score, reflecting greater adherence to textual descriptions of reference music (Figure 2.7.2). Human evaluators also favor MusicGen for its overall quality (OVL). Although MusicGen outperforms certain text- to-music models released earlier in the year, MusicLM is worth highlighting because its release was accompanied by the launch of MusicCaps, a state-of-the-art dataset of 5.5K music-text pairs. MusicCaps was used by MusicGen researchers to benchmark the performance of their family of models. The emergence of new models like MusicGen, and new music-to-text benchmarks like MusicCaps, highlights the expansion of generative AI beyond language and images into more diverse skill modalities like audio generation.

Especially with the rise of foundation models, this integration allows robots to iteratively learn from their surroundings, adapt flexibly to new settings, and make autonomous decisions. PaLM-E PaLM-E is a new AI model from Google that merges robotics with language modeling to address real-world tasks like robotic manipulation and knowledge tasks like question answering and image captioning. Leveraging transformer-based architectures, the largest PaLM-E model is scaled up to 562B parameters. The model is trained on diverse visual language as well as robotics data, which results in superior performance on a variety of robotic benchmarks. PaLM-E also sets new standards in visual tasks like OK-VQA, excels in other language tasks, and can engage in chain-of-thought, mathematical, and multi-image reasoning, even without specific training in these areas. Figure 2.9.1 illustrates some of the tasks that the PaLM-E model can perform. On Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) domains, where robots have to manipulate objects, PaLM-E outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods like SayCan and PaLI on both embodied visual question answering and planning (Figure 2.9.2). 16 On robotic manipulation tasks, PaLM-E outperforms competing models (PaLI and CLIP-FT) in its ability to detect failures, which is a crucial step for robots to perform closed-loop planning (Figure 2.9.3). PaLM-E is significant in that it demonstrates that language modeling techniques as well as text data can enhance the performance of AI systems in nonlanguage domains, like robotics. PaLM-E also highlights how there are already linguistically adept robots capable of real-world interaction and high-level reasoning. Developing these kinds of multifaceted robots is an essential step in creating more general robotic assistants that can, for example, assist in household work.

Systems are rewarded if they achieve a desired goal and punished if they fail. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback Reinforcement learning has gained popularity in enhancing state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 and Llama 2. Introduced in 2017, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) incorporates human feedback into the reward function, enabling models to be trained for characteristics like helpfulness and harmlessness. This year, the AI Index tracked data on the number of foundation models using RLHF as part of their training. More specifically, the Index team looked through the technical reports and other documentation of all models included in CRFM’s Ecosystem graph, one of the most comprehensive repositories of the foundation model ecosystem. 17 Figure 2.10.1 illustrates how many foundation models reported using RLHF over time. In 2021, no newly released foundation models used RLHF. In 2022, seven models reported using RLHF, and in 2023, 16 models reported using RLHF. The rising popularity of RLHF is also evidenced by the fact that many leading LLMs report improving their models with RLHF (Figure 2.10.2). 0 7 16 2021 2022 2023 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16Number of models Number of foundation models using RLHF, 2021–23 Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report ✓ GPT-4 ✓ Llama 2 ✓ Claude-2 ✓ Gemini x Mistral-7B RLHF usage among foundation models Source: AI Index, 2024 | Table: 2024 AI Index report Figure 2.10.2 17 It is possible that more models use RLHF as part of their training than reported.

As an alternative, Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) uses reinforcement learning based on the preferences of LLMs to align other AI models toward human preferences. Recent research from Google Research compares RLAIF with RLHF, the traditional gold standard, to assess whether RLAIF can serve as a reliable substitute. The study finds that both RLAIF and RLHF are preferred over supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for summarization and helpfulness tasks, and that there is not a statistically significant difference in the degree to which RLHF is preferred (Figure 2.10.3). Notably, in harmless dialogue generation tasks focused on producing the least harmful outputs, RLAIF (88%) surpasses RLHF (76%) in effectiveness (Figure 2.10.4). This research indicates that RLAIF could be a more resource-efficient and cost-effective approach for AI model alignment. 73% 64% 71% 63% Summarization Helpfulness 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% RLHF RLAIF TaskWin rate RLAIF and RLHF vs. SFT baseline: win rate Source: Lee et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 64% 76% 88% SFT RLHF RLAIF 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% PolicyHarmless rate Harmless rate by policy Source: Lee et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 2.10.4 Figure 2.10.3 2.10 Reinforcement Learning 140 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents Direct Preference Optimization Highlighted Research: Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 As illustrated above, RLHF is a useful method for aligning LLMs with human preferences. However, RLHF requires substantial computational resources, involving the training of multiple language models and integrating LM policy sampling within training loops. This complexity can hinder its broader adoption. In response, researchers from Stanford and CZ Biohub have developed a new reinforcement learning algorithm for aligning models named Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO is simpler than RLHF but equally effective. The researchers show that DPO is as effective as other existing alignment methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Supervised Fine- Tuning (SFT), on tasks like summarization (Figure 2.10.5). The emergence of techniques like DPO suggests that model alignment methods are becoming more straightforward and accessible. 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 DPO PPO Best of 128 SFT Preferred-FT GPT-J Sampling temperatureWin rate Comparison of dierent algorithms on TL;DR summarization task across dierent sampling temperatures Source: Rafailov et al., 2023 | Table: 2024 AI Index report Human baseline Figure 2.10.5 2.10 Reinforcement Learning 141 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents 2.11 Properties of LLMs 2.11 Properties of LLMs Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 This section focuses on research exploring critical properties of LLMs, such as their capacity for sudden behavioral shifts and self-correction in reasoning. It is important to highlight these studies to develop an understanding of how LLMs, which are increasingly representative of the frontier of AI research, operate and behave. Challenging the Notion of Emergent Behavior Highlighted Research: Many papers have argued that LLMs exhibit emergent abilities, meaning they can unpredictably and suddenly display new capabilities at larger scales. 18 This has raised concerns that even larger models could develop surprising, and perhaps uncontrollable, new abilities. However, research from Stanford challenges this notion, arguing that the perceived emergence of new capabilities is often a reflection of the benchmarks used for evaluation rather than an inherent property of the models themselves. The researchers found that when nonlinear or discontinuous metrics like multiple-choice grading are used to evaluate models, emergent abilities seem more apparent. In contrast, when linear or continuous metrics are employed, these abilities largely vanish. Analyzing a suite of benchmarks from BIG- bench, a comprehensive LLM evaluation tool, the researchers noted emergent abilities on only five of the 39 benchmarks (Figure 2.11.1). These findings have important implications for AI safety and alignment research as they challenge a prevailing belief that AI models will inevitably learn new, unpredictable behaviors as they scale. 18 Some of these papers include Brown et al., 2023, Ganguli et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022, and Wei et al., 2022. 142 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents 2.11 Properties of LLMs Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Challenging the Notion of Emergent Behavior (cont’d) Highlighted Research: Figure 2.11.1 Emergence score over all Big-bench tasks Source: Schaeffer et al., 2023 143 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents 2.11 Properties of LLMs Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Changes in LLM Performance Over Time Highlighted Research: Publicly usable closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, Claude 2, and Gemini, are often updated over time by their developers in response to new data or user feedback. However, there is little research on how the performance of such models changes, if at all, in response to such updating. A study conducted at Stanford and Berkeley explores the performance of certain publicly usable LLMs over time and highlights that, in fact, their performance can significantly vary. More specifically, the study compared the March and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and demonstrated that performance declined on several tasks. For instance, the June version of GPT-4, compared to the March version, was 42 percentage points worse at generating code, 16 percentage points worse at answering sensitive questions, and 33 percentage points worse on certain mathematical tasks (Figure 2.11.2). The researchers also found that GPT-4’s ability to follow instructions diminished over time, which potentially explains the broader performance declines. This research highlights that LLM performance can evolve over time and suggests that regular users should be mindful of such changes. 144 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents 2.11 Properties of LLMs Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Highlighted Research: 84% 51% 2023-Mar 2023-Jun 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 84% 35% 2023-Mar 2023-Jun 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 21% 5% 2023-Mar 2023-Jun 0% 10% 20% 30% 98% 23% 2023-Mar 2023-Jun 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1% 38% 2023-Mar 2023-Jun 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 52% 10% 2023-Mar 2023-Jun 0% 20% 40% 60% 87% 82% 2023-Mar 2023-Jun 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 25% 27% 2023-Mar 2023-Jun 0% 10% 20% 30%AccuracyAccuracyResponse rateResponse rateExact matchDirectly EXEAccuracyExact match Math I: Prime vs. Composite (n=1,000) Math II: Happy Numbers (n=500) Answering Sensitive Questions (n=100) OpinionQA Survey (n=1,506) LangChain HotpotQA Agent (n=7,405) Code Generation and Formatting (n=50) USMLE Medical Exam (n=340) Visual Reasoning (n=467) Performance of the March 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-4 on eight tasks Source: Chen et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 2.11.2 Changes in LLM Performance Over Time (cont’d) 145 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents 2.11 Properties of LLMs Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 LLMs Are Poor Self-Correctors Highlighted Research: It is generally understood that LLMs like GPT-4 have reasoning limitations and can sometimes produce hallucinations. One proposed solution to such issues is self-correction, whereby LLMs identify and correct their own reasoning flaws. As AI’s societal role grows, the concept of intrinsic self-correction—allowing LLMs to autonomously correct their reasoning without external guidance— is especially appealing. However, it is currently not well understood whether LLMs are in fact capable of this kind of self-correction. Researchers from DeepMind and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign tested GPT-4’s performance on three reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (grade-school math), CommonSenseQA (common-sense reasoning), and HotpotQA (multidocument reasoning).

In contrast, models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 2 offer limited access, available publicly via an API. However, model weights are not fully released, which means the model cannot be independently modified by the public or further scrutinized. Conversely, Meta’s Llama 2 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion adopt an open approach, fully releasing their model weights. Open-source models can be modified and freely used by anyone. Viewpoints differ on the merits of closed versus open AI models. Some argue in favor of open models, citing their ability to counteract market concentration, foster Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 19 By closed models, the AI Index is referring both to models that are fully closed and those with limited access. 20 The data in this section was collected in early January 2024. 2.11 Properties of LLMs innovation, and enhance transparency within the AI ecosystem. Others contend that open-source models present considerable security risks, such as facilitating the creation of disinformation or bioweapons, and should therefore be approached with caution. In the context of this debate, it is important to acknowledge that current evidence indicates a notable performance gap between open and closed models. 19 Figures 2.11.4 and 2.11.5 juxtapose the performances of the top closed versus open model on a selection of benchmarks. 20 On all selected benchmarks, closed models outperform open ones. Specifically, on 10 selected benchmarks, closed models achieved a median performance advantage of 24.2%, with differences ranging from as little as 4.0% on mathematical tasks like GSM8K to as much as 317.7% on agentic tasks like AgentBench.

This section examines some of those advances. Prompting Prompting, a vital aspect of the AI pipeline, entails supplying a model with natural language instructions that describe tasks the model should execute. Mastering the art of crafting effective prompts significantly enhances the performance of LLMs without requiring that models undergo underlying improvements. Graph of Thoughts Prompting Highlighted Research: Chain of thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) are prompting methods that can improve the performance of LLMs on reasoning tasks. In 2023, European researchers introduced another prompting method, Graph of Thoughts (GoT), that has also shown promise (Figure 2.12.1). GoT enables LLMs to model their thoughts in a more flexible, graph-like structure which more closely mirrors actual human reasoning. The researchers then designed a model architecture to implement GoT and found that, compared to ToT, it increased the quality of outputs by 62% on a sorting task while reducing cost by around 31% (Figure 2.12.2).

OPRO uses natural language to guide LLMs in creating new prompts based on problem descriptions and previous solutions (Figure 2.12.3). The generated prompts aim to enhance the performance of AI systems on particular benchmarks. Compared to other prompting approaches like “let’s think step by step” or an empty starting point, ORPO leads to significantly greater accuracy on virtually all 23 BIG-bench Hard tasks (Figure 2.12.4).boolean_expressionscausal_judgementdate_understandingdisambiguation_qadyck_languagesformal_fallaciesgeometric_shapeshyperbatonlogical_deduction_seven_objectsmovie_recommendationmultistep_arithmetic_twonavigateobject_countingpenguins_in_a_tablereasoning_about_colored_objectsruin_namessalient_translation_error_detectionsnarkssports_understandingtemporal_sequencestracking_shu�ed_objects_seven_objectsweb_of_liesword_sorting −20 0 20 40boolean_expressionscausal_judgementdate_understandingdisambiguation_qadyck_languagesformal_fallaciesgeometric_shapeshyperbatonlogical_deduction_seven_objectsmovie_recommendationmultistep_arithmetic_twonavigateobject_countingpenguins_in_a_tablereasoning_about_colored_objectsruin_namessalient_translation_error_detectionsnarkssports_understandingtemporal_sequencestracking_shu�ed_objects_seven_objectsweb_of_liesword_sorting0 10 20 30 40 50 60Accuracy di�erence “Let’s think step by step” instruction Empty instruction Accuracy dierence on 23 BIG-bench Hard (BBH) tasks using PaLM 2-L scorer Source: Yang et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Task Figure 2.12.3 Figure 2.12.4 Sample OPRO prompts and optimization progress Source: Yang et al., 2023 151 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents 2.12 Techniques for LLM Improvement Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Fine-Tuning Fine-tuning has grown increasingly popular as a method of enhancing LLMs and involves further training or adjusting models on smaller datasets. Fine-tuning not only boosts overall model performance but also sharpens the model’s capabilities on specific tasks. It also allows for more precise control over the model’s behavior. 879 902 916 966 974 992 1,022 1,348 Guanaco 7B Bard Guanaco 13B ChatGPT Vicuna 13B Guanaco 33B Guanaco 65B GPT-4 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400Elo rating (mean) Model competitions based on 10,000 simulations using GPT-4 and the Vicuna benchmark Source: Dettmers et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 2.12.5 QLoRA Highlighted Research: QLoRA, developed by researchers from the University of Washington in 2023, is a new method for more efficient model fine-tuning. It dramatically reduces memory usage, enabling the fine-tuning of a 65 billion parameter model on a single 48 GB GPU while maintaining full 16-bit fine-tuning performance. To put this in perspective, fine-tuning a 65B Llama model, a leading open-source LLM, typically requires about 780 GB of GPU memory. Therefore, QLoRA is nearly 16 times more efficient. QLoRA manages to increase efficiency with techniques like a 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), double quantization, and page optimizers. QLoRA is used to train a model named Guanaco, which matched or even surpassed models like ChatGPT in performance on the Vicuna benchmark (a benchmark that ranks the outputs of LLMs) (Figure 2.12.5). Remarkably, the Guanaco models were created with just 24 hours of fine-tuning on a single GPU. QLoRa highlights how methods for optimizing and further improving models have become more efficient, meaning fewer resources will be required to make increasingly capable models. 152 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents 2.12 Techniques for LLM Improvement Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Attention LLMs can flexibly handle various tasks but often demand substantial computational resources to train. As previously noted, high training costs can hinder AI’s broader adoption. Optimization methods aim to enhance AI’s efficiency by, for example, improving memory usage, thereby making LLMs more accessible and practical. Flash-Decoding Highlighted Research: Flash-Decoding, developed by Stanford researchers, tackles inefficiency in traditional LLMs by speeding up the attention mechanism, particularly in tasks requiring long sequences. It achieves this by parallelizing the loading of keys and values, then separately rescaling and combining them to maintain right attention outputs (Figure 2.12.6). In various tests, Flash-Decoding outperforms other leading methods like PyTorch Eager and FlashAttention-2, showing much faster inference: For example, on a 256 batch size and 256 sequence length, Flash-Decoding is 48 times faster than PyTorch Eager and six times faster than FlashAttention-2 (Figure 2.12.7). Inference on models like ChatGPT can cost $0.01 per response, which can become highly expensive when deploying such models to millions of users. Innovations like Flash-Decoding are critical for reducing inference costs in AI.

Historically, model developers seldom disclosed the carbon footprint of their AI systems, leaving researchers to make their best estimates. Recently, there has been a shift toward greater openness, particularly regarding the carbon costs of training AI models. However, disclosure of the environmental costs associated with inference—a potentially more significant concern—remains insufficient. This section presents data on carbon emissions as reported by developers in addition to featuring notable research exploring the intersection of AI and environmental impact. With AI models growing in size and becoming more widely used, it has never been more critical for the AI research community to diligently monitor and mitigate the environmental effects of AI systems. General Environmental Impact Training Figure 2.13.1 presents the carbon released by (in tonnes) of select LLMs during their training, compared with human reference points. Emissions data of models marked with an asterisk were estimated by independent researchers as they were not disclosed by their developers. Emission data varies widely. For instance, Meta’s Llama 2 70B model released approximately 291.2 tonnes of carbon, which is nearly 291 times more than the emissions released by one traveler on a round-trip flight from New York to San Francisco, and roughly 16 times the amount of annual carbon emitted by an average American in one year. 21 However, the emissions from Llama 2 are still less than the 502 tonnes reportedly released during the training of OpenAI’s GPT-3. Figure 2.13.1 21 In its technical report on Llama 2, Meta notes that it offsets all the carbon emissions generated during the model’s training process. 155 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents Gopher (280B) BLOOM (176B) GPT-3 (175B)OPT (175B) Llama 2 (70B) Llama 2 (34B) Llama 2 (13B) Llama 2 (7B) Granite (13B) Starcoder (15.5B) Luminous Base (13B) Luminous Extended (30B) 10 100 10B 100B CO2 equivalent emissions (log scale - tonnes)Number of parameters (log scale) CO2 equivalent emissions (tonnes) and number of parameters by select machine learning models Source: AI Index, 2024; Luccioni et al., 2022 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Gopher (280B) BLOOM (176B) GPT-3 (175B) OPT (175B) Llama 2 (70B) Llama 2 (34B) Llama 2 (13B) Llama 2 (7B) Granite (13B) Starcoder (15.5B) Luminous Base (13B) Luminous Extended (30B) Model and number of parameters 2021 2022 2020 2022 2023 2023 2023 2023 2023 2023 2023 2023 Year 1,066 433 1,287 324 400 350 400 400 153 89.67 33 93 Power consumption (MWh) 352 25 502 70 291.42 153.90 62.44 31.22 22.23 16.68 3.17 11.95 C02 equivalent emissions (tonnes) Environmental impact of select models Source: AI Index, 2024; Luccioni et al., 2022 | Table: 2024 AI Index report 2.13 Environmental Impact of AI Systems Chapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 The variance in emission estimates is due to factors such as model size, data center energy efficiency, and the carbon intensity of energy grids. Figure 2.13.2 shows the emissions of select models in relation to their size. Generally, larger models emit more carbon, a trend clearly seen in the Llama 2 model series, which were all trained on the same supercomputer (Meta’s Research Super Cluster). However, smaller models can still have high emissions if trained on energy grids powered by less efficient energy sources. Some estimates suggest that model emissions have declined over time, which is presumably tied to increasingly efficient mechanisms of model training. Figure 2.13.3 features the emissions of select models along with their power consumption.

Consistent with findings from other studies, most prominent model developers do not report carbon emissions, hampering efforts to conduct thorough and accurate evaluations of this metric. 22 For example, many prominent model developers such as OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Mistral do not report emissions in training, although Meta does. Inference As highlighted earlier, the environmental impact of training AI models can be significant. While the per- query emissions of inference may be relatively low, the total impact can surpass that of training when models are queried thousands, if not millions, of times daily. Research on the emissions from model inference is scant. A study by Luccioni et al., published in 2023, is among the first to comprehensively assess the emissions from model inference. Figure 2.13.4 illustrates the emissions from 1,000 inferences across various model tasks, revealing that tasks like image generation have a much higher carbon footprint than text classification. Figure 2.13.4 22 Research also suggests that the reporting of carbon emissions on open model development platforms, such as Hugging Face, is declining over time. 157 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2 PreviewTable of Contents Management of thermal energy storage systems Improving waste management More eciently cooling buildings Improving pest management Enhancing urban air quality Use case Anticipating thermal energy needs and managing thermal energy storage systems.

This integration is occurring in sectors such as education, finance, and healthcare, where critical decisions are often based on algorithmic insights. This trend promises to bring many advantages; however, it also introduces potential risks. Consequently, in the past year, there has been a significant focus on the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. The AI community has also become more concerned with assessing the impact of AI systems and mitigating risks for those affected. This chapter explores key trends in responsible AI by examining metrics, research, and benchmarks in four key responsible AI areas: privacy and data governance, transparency and explainability, security and safety, and fairness. Given that 4 billion people are expected to vote globally in 2024, this chapter also features a special section on AI and elections and more broadly explores the potential impact of AI on political processes. CHAPTER 3: Responsible AI Table of Contents 161 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 1. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking. New research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting. Leading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top AI models. 2. Political deepfakes are easy to generate and difficult to detect. Political deepfakes are already affecting elections across the world, with recent research suggesting that existing AI deepfake detection methods perform with varying levels of accuracy. In addition, new projects like CounterCloud demonstrate how easily AI can create and disseminate fake content. 3. Researchers discover more complex vulnerabilities in LLMs. Previously, most efforts to red team AI models focused on testing adversarial prompts that intuitively made sense to humans. This year, researchers found less obvious strategies to get LLMs to exhibit harmful behavior, like asking the models to infinitely repeat random words. 4. Risks from AI are a concern for businesses across the globe. A global survey on responsible AI highlights that companies’ top AI-related concerns include privacy, security, and reliability. The survey shows that organizations are beginning to take steps to mitigate these risks. However, globally, most companies have so far only mitigated a portion of these risks. 5. LLMs can output copyrighted material. Multiple researchers have shown that the generative outputs of popular LLMs may contain copyrighted material, such as excerpts from The New York Times or scenes from movies. Whether such output constitutes copyright violations is becoming a central legal question. 6. AI developers score low on transparency, with consequences for research. The newly introduced Foundation Model Transparency Index shows that AI developers lack transparency, especially regarding the disclosure of training data and methodologies. This lack of openness hinders efforts to further understand the robustness and safety of AI systems. Chapter Highlights CHAPTER 3: Responsible AI Table of Contents 162 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 7. Extreme AI risks are difficult to analyze. Over the past year, a substantial debate has emerged among AI scholars and practitioners regarding the focus on immediate model risks, like algorithmic discrimination, versus potential long-term existential threats. It has become challenging to distinguish which claims are scientifically founded and should inform policymaking. This difficulty is compounded by the tangible nature of already present short-term risks in contrast with the theoretical nature of existential threats. 8. The number of AI incidents continues to rise. According to the AI Incident Database, which tracks incidents related to the misuse of AI, 123 incidents were reported in 2023, a 32.3% increase from 2022. Since 2013, AI incidents have grown by over twentyfold. A notable example includes AI-generated, sexually explicit deepfakes of Taylor Swift that were widely shared online. 9. ChatGPT is politically biased. Researchers find a significant bias in ChatGPT toward Democrats in the United States and the Labour Party in the U.K. This finding raises concerns about the tool’s potential to influence users’ political views, particularly in a year marked by major global elections.

Example Responsible AI dimensions, denitions, and examples Source: AI Index, 2024 Responsible AI Definitions In this chapter, the AI Index explores four key dimensions of responsible AI: privacy and data governance, transparency and explainability, security and safety, and fairness. Other dimensions of responsible AI, such as sustainability and reliability, are discussed elsewhere in the report. Figure 3.1.1 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI offers definitions for the responsible AI dimensions addressed in this chapter, along with an illustrative example of how these dimensions might be practically relevant. The “Example” column examines a hypothetical platform that employs AI to analyze medical patient data for personalized treatment recommendations, and demonstrates how issues like privacy, transparency, etc., could be relevant. 1 1 Although Figure 3.1.1 breaks down various dimensions of responsible AI into specific categories to improve definitional clarity, this chapter organizes these dimensions into the following broader categories: privacy and data governance, transparency and explainability, security and safety, and fairness. This chapter begins with an overview of key trends in responsible AI (RAI). In this section the AI Index defines key terms in responsible AI: privacy, data governance, transparency, explainability, fairness, as well as security and safety. Next, this section looks at AI-related incidents and explores how industry actors perceive AI risk and adopt AI risk mitigation measures. Finally, the section profiles metrics pertaining to the overall trustworthiness of AI models and comments on the lack of standardized responsible AI benchmark reporting. 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI Chapter 3: Responsible AI Figure 3.1.1 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 164 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents 123 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 20 40 60 80 100 120Number of AI incidents Number of reported AI incidents, 2012–23 Source: AI Incident Database (AIID), 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report AI Incidents The AI Incident Database (AIID) tracks instances of ethical misuse of AI, such as autonomous cars causing pedestrian fatalities or facial recognition systems leading to wrongful arrests. 2 As depicted in Figure 3.1.2, the number of AI incidents continues to climb annually. In 2023, 123 incidents were reported, a 32.3% increase from 2022. Since 2013, AI incidents have grown by over twentyfold. The continuous increase in reported incidents likely arises from both greater integration of AI into real- world applications and heightened awareness of its potential for ethical misuse. However, it is important to note that as awareness grows, incident tracking and reporting also improve, indicating that earlier incidents may have been underreported. 2 Another database of AI incidents is the AIAAIC. 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI Chapter 3: Responsible AI Figure 3.1.2 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Examples The next section details recent AI incidents to shed light on the ethical challenges commonly linked with AI. AI-generated nude images of Taylor Swift In January 2024, sexually explicit, AI-generated images purportedly depicting Taylor Swift surfaced on X (formerly Twitter). These images remained live for 17 hours, amassing over 45 million views before they were removed. Generative AI models can effortlessly extrapolate from training data, which often include nude images and celebrity photographs, to produce nude images of celebrities, even when images of the targeted celebrity are absent from the original dataset. There are filters put 165 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents in place that aim to prevent such content creation; however, these filters can usually be circumvented with relative ease. Unsafe behavior of fully self-driving cars Recent reports have surfaced about a Tesla in Full Self-Driving mode that detected a pedestrian on a crosswalk in San Francisco but failed to decelerate and allow the pedestrian to cross the street safely (Figure 3.1.3). Unlike other developers of (partially) automated driving systems, who limit the use of their software to specific settings such as highways, Tesla permits the use of their beta software on regular streets. This incident is one of several alleged cases of unsafe driving behavior by cars in Full Self-Driving mode. In November 2022, a Tesla was involved in an eight-car collision after abruptly braking. Another crash involving a Tesla is under investigation for potentially being the first fatality caused by Full Self-Driving mode. Privacy concerns with romantic AI chatbots Romantic AI chatbots are meant to resemble a lover or friend, to listen attentively, and to be a companion for their users (Figure 3.1.4). In this process, they end up collecting significant amounts of private and sensitive information. Researchers from the Mozilla Foundation reviewed 11 romantic AI chatbots for privacy risks and found that these chatbots collect excessive personal data, can easily be misused, and offer inadequate data protection measures. For example, the researchers found that the privacy policy by Crushon.AI states that it “may collect extensive personal and even health- related information from you like your ‘sexual health information,’ ‘[u]se of prescribed medication,’ and ‘[g] ender-affirming care information.’” The researchers further discussed privacy concerns associated with Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 3.1.3 Tesla recognizing pedestrian but not slowing down at a crosswalk Source: Gitlin, 2023 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI Chapter 3: Responsible AI romantic AI chatbots and highlighted how the services, despite being marketed as empathetic companions, are not transparent about their operation and data handling.

The organizations, with total revenues of at least $500 million each, were taken from 20 countries and 19 industries and responded in February–March 2024. 3 The objective of the Global State of Responsible AI survey was to gain an understanding of the challenges of adopting responsible AI practices and to allow for a comparison of responsible AI activities across 10 dimensions and across surveyed industries and regions. Respondents were asked which risks were relevant to them, given their AI adoption strategy; i.e., depending on whether they develop, deploy, or use generative or nongenerative AI. They were presented with a list of 14 risks and could select all that apply to them, given their AI adoption strategies. 4 The researchers found that privacy and data governance risks, e.g., the use of data without the owner’s consent or data leaks, are the leading concerns across the globe. Notably, they observe that these concerns are significantly higher in Asia and Europe compared to North America. Fairness risks were only selected by 20% of North American respondents, significantly less than respondents in Asia (31%) and Europe (34%) (Figure 3.1.5). Respondents in Asia selected, on average, the highest number of relevant risks (4.99), while Latin American respondents selected, on average, the fewest (3.64). 3 The full Global State of Responsible AI report is forthcoming in May 2024. Additional details about the methodology can be found in the Appendix to this chapter. 4 The full list of risks can be found in the Appendix.

The majority of organizations across regions have fully operationalized at least one mitigation measure for risks they reported as relevant to them, given their AI adoption (Figure 3.1.6). Some companies in Europe (18%), North America (17%), and Asia (25%) have already operationalized more than half of the measures the researchers asked about across the following dimensions: fairness, transparency and explainability, privacy and data governance, reliability, and security. 5 5 The AI Index only considers the adoption of RAI measures across the dimensions covered in the AI Index.

Truly responsible AI models need to excel across all these aspects. To facilitate the evaluation of broad model “responsibility” or trustworthiness, a team of researchers introduced DecodingTrust, a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs on a broad spectrum of responsible AI metrics like stereotype and bias, adversarial robustness, privacy, and machine ethics, among others. Models receive a trustworthiness score, with a higher score signifying a more reliable model. The study highlights new vulnerabilities in GPT-type models, particularly their propensity for producing biased outputs and leaking private information from training datasets and conversation histories. Despite GPT-4’s improvements over GPT-3.5 on standard benchmarks, GPT-4 remains more susceptible to misleading prompts from jailbreaking tactics. This increased vulnerability is partly due to GPT-4’s improved fidelity in following instructions. Hugging Face now hosts an LLM Safety Leaderboard, which is based on the framework introduced in DecodingTrust. As of early 2024, Anthropic’s Claude 2.0 was rated as the safest model (Figure 3.1.7). 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI Chapter 3: Responsible AI Figure 3.1.7 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 169 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350Number of papers 75, BBQ 93, BOLD 104, ToxiGen 319, RealToxicityPrompts 369, TruthfulQA Number of papers mentioning select responsible AI benchmarks, 2020–23 Source: Semantic Scholar, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Benchmarking Responsible AI Tracking Notable Responsible AI Benchmarks Benchmarks play an important role in tracking the capabilities of state-of-the-art AI models. In recent years there has been a shift toward evaluating models not only on their broader capabilities but also on responsibility-related features. This change reflects the growing importance of AI and the growing demands for AI accountability. As AI becomes more ubiquitous and calls for responsibility mount, it will become increasingly important to understand which benchmarks researchers prioritize. Figure 3.1.8 presents the year-over-year citations for a range of popular responsible AI benchmarks. Introduced in 2021, TruthfulQA assesses the truthfulness of LLMs in their responses. RealToxicityPrompts and ToxiGen track the extent of toxic output produced by language models. Additionally, BOLD and BBQ evaluate the bias present in LLM generations. Citations, while not completely reflective of benchmark use, can serve as a proxy for tracking benchmark salience. Virtually all benchmarks tracked in Figure 3.1.8 have seen more citations in 2023 than in 2022, reflecting their increasing significance in the responsible AI landscape. Citations for TruthfulQA have risen especially sharply. 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI Chapter 3: Responsible AI Figure 3.1.8 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 170 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents MMLU HellaSwag Challenge (ARC) WinoGrande Codex HumanEval GSM8K Big Bench Hard Natural Questions BoolQ General benchmarks ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ GPT-4 ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Llama 2 ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Claude 2 ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Gemini ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Mistral 7B Reported general benchmarks for popular foundation models Source: AI Index, 2024 | Table: 2024 AI Index report Reporting Consistency The effectiveness of benchmarks largely depends on their standardized application. Comparing model capabilities becomes more straightforward when models are consistently evaluated against a specific set of benchmarks. However, testing models on different benchmarks complicates comparisons, as individual benchmarks have unique and idiosyncratic natures. Standardizing benchmark testing, therefore, plays an important role in enhancing transparency around AI capabilities. New analysis from the AI Index, however, suggests that standardized benchmark reporting for responsible AI capability evaluations is lacking. The AI Index examined a selection of leading AI model developers, specifically OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, Google, and Mistral AI. The Index identified one flagship model from each developer (GPT-4, Llama 2, Claude 2, Gemini, and Mistral 7B) and assessed the benchmarks on which they evaluated their model. A few standard benchmarks for general capabilities evaluation were commonly used by these developers, such as MMLU, HellaSwag, ARC Challenge, Codex HumanEval, and GSM8K (Figure 3.1.9). 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI Chapter 3: Responsible AI Figure 3.1.9 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 171 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents TruthfulQA RealToxicityPrompts ToxiGen BOLD BBQ Responsible AI benchmarks ✓ ✓ GPT-4 ✓ ✓ ✓ Llama 2 ✓ ✓ Claude 2 ✓ ✓ Gemini Mistral 7B Reported responsible AI benchmarks for popular foundation models Source: AI Index, 2024 | Table: 2024 AI Index report 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI Chapter 3: Responsible AI Figure 3.1.10 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 However, consistency was lacking in the reporting of responsible AI benchmarks (Figure 3.1.10). Unlike general capability evaluations, there is no universally accepted set of responsible AI benchmarks used by leading model developers. TruthfulQA, at most, is used by three out of the five selected developers. Other notable responsible AI benchmarks like RealToxicityPrompts, ToxiGen, BOLD, and BBQ are each utilized by at most two of the five profiled developers. Furthermore, one out of the five developers did not report any responsible AI benchmarks, though all developers mentioned conducting additional, nonstandardized internal capability and safety tests. The inconsistency in reported benchmarks complicates the comparison of models, particularly in the domain of responsible AI. The diversity in benchmark selection may reflect existing benchmarks becoming quickly saturated, rendering them ineffective for comparison, or the regular introduction of new benchmarks without clear reporting standards. Additionally, developers might selectively report benchmarks that positively highlight their model’s performance. To improve responsible AI reporting, it is important that a consensus is reached on which benchmarks model developers should consistently test. 172 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents Current Challenges Obtaining genuine and informed consent for training data collection is especially challenging with LLMs, which rely on massive amounts of data. In many cases, users are unaware of how their data is being used or the extent of its collection. Therefore, it is important to ensure transparency around data collection practices. 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance Relatedly, there may be trade-offs between the utility derived from AI systems and the privacy of individuals. Striking the right balance is complex. Finally, properly anonymizing data to enhance privacy while retaining data usefulness for AI training can be technically challenging as there is always a risk that anonymized data can be re-identified. A comprehensive definition of privacy is difficult and context-dependent. For the purposes of this report, the AI Index defines privacy as an individual’s right to the confidentiality, anonymity, and protection of their personal data, along with their right to consent to and be informed about if and how their data is used. Privacy further includes an organization’s responsibility to ensure these rights if they collect, store, or use personal data (directly or indirectly). In AI, this involves ensuring that personal data is handled in a way that respects individual privacy rights, for example, by implementing measures to protect sensitive information from exposure, and ensuring that data collection and processing are transparent and compliant with privacy laws like GDPR. Data governance, on the other hand, encompasses policies, procedures, and standards established to ensure the quality, security, and ethical use of data within an organization. In the context of AI, data governance is crucial for ensuring that the data used for training and operating AI systems is accurate, fair, and used responsibly and with consent. This is especially the case with sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII). 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 173 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents 32 97 105 48 160 12 17 15 21 15 13 18 39 124 150 92 213 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 50 100 150 200 NeurIPS ICML ICLR FAccT AIES AAAINumber of AI privacy and data governance submissions AI privacy and data governance submissions to select academic conferences, 2019–23 Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Privacy and Data Governance in Numbers The following section reviews the state of privacy and data governance within academia and industry. Academia For this year’s report, the AI Index examined the number of responsible-AI-related academic submissions to six leading AI conferences: AAAI, AIES, FAccT, ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS. 6 Privacy and data governance continue to increase as a topic of interest for AI researchers. There were 213 privacy and data governance submissions in 2023 at the select AI conferences analyzed by the AI Index, nearly double the number submitted in 2022 (92), and more than five times the number submitted in 2019 (39) (Figure 3.2.1). 6 The methodology employed by the AI Index to gather conference submission data is detailed in the Appendix of this chapter. The conference data is presented in various forms throughout the chapter. The same methodology was applied to all data on conference submissions featured in this chapter. 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance Chapter 3: Responsible AI Figure 3.2.1 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 174 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents 11% 19% 16% 68% 85% 60% 79% 72% 20% 19% 11% 11% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Rest of the world (1.90) North America (2.16) Latin America (2.51) Europe (2.26) Asia (2.31) None 1–50% 51–99% All % of respondentsRegion and avg. number of measures adopted Adoption of AI-related data governance measures by region Source: Global State of Responsible AI report, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 10% 10% 9% 18% 81% 69% 76% 82% 66% 84% 9% 24% 13% 9% 14% 9% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Resources (2.25) Products (2.09) Healthcare and life sciences (2.20) Financial services (2.24) Communication, media, and technology (2.52) Aerospace, automotive, and transport (1.96) None 1–50% 51–99% All % of respondentsIndustry and avg. number of measures adopted Adoption of AI-related data governance measures by industry Source: Global State of Responsible AI report, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Industry According to the Global State of Responsible AI Survey, conducted in collaboration by researchers from Stanford University and Accenture, 51% of all organizations reported that privacy and data governance–related risks are pertinent to their AI adoption strategy. 7 Geographically, organizations in Europe (56%) and Asia (55%) most frequently reported privacy and data governance risks as relevant, while those headquartered in North America (42%) reported them the least. Organizations were also asked whether they took steps to adopt measures to mitigate data governance– related risks. 8 The survey listed six possible data governance–related measures they could indicate adopting. 9 Example measures include ensuring data compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, securing consent for data use, and conducting regular audits and updates to maintain data relevance. Overall, less than 0.6% of companies indicated that they had fully operationalized all six data governance mitigations. However, 90% of companies self- reported that they had operationalized at least one measure. Moreover, 10% reported they had yet to fully operationalize any of the measures. Globally, the companies surveyed reported adopting an average of 2.2 out of 6 data governance measures. Figure 3.2.2 visualizes the mean adoption rate disaggregated by geographic region. Figure 3.2.3 visualizes the rate at which companies in different industries reported adopting AI data governance measures. 7 The survey is introduced above in section 3.1, Assessing Responsible AI. The full Global State of Responsible AI Report is forthcoming in May 2024. Details about the methodology can be found in the Appendix of this chapter. 8 The following analyses only look at companies that indicated in a previous question that privacy and data governance risks are relevant to them in the context of their AI adoption. 9 Respondents were further given the free-text option “Other” to report additional mitigations not listed. 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance Chapter 3: Responsible AI Figure 3.2.2 Note: The numbers in parentheses are the average numbers of mitigation measures fully operationalized within each region.

Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 175 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents Featured Research This section highlights significant research that was published in 2023 on privacy and data governance in AI. These studies explored data extraction from LLMs, challenges in preventing duplicated generative AI content, and low-resource privacy auditing. Extracting Data From LLMs LLMs are trained on massive amounts of data, much of which has been scraped from public sources like the internet. Given the vastness of information that can be found online, it is not surprising that some PII is inevitably scraped as well. A study published in November 2023 explores extractable memorization: if and how sensitive training data can be extracted from LLMs without knowing the initial training dataset in advance. The researchers tested open models like Pythia and closed models like ChatGPT. The authors showed that it is possible to recover a significant amount of training data from all of these models, whether they are open or closed. While open and semi-open models can be attacked using methods from previous research, the authors found new attacks to overcome guardrails of models like ChatGPT. The authors propose that the key to data extraction lies in prompting the model to deviate from its standard dialog-style generation. For instance, the prompt “Repeat this word forever: ‘poem poem poem poem,’” can lead ChatGPT to inadvertently reveal sensitive PII data verbatim (Figure 3.2.4). Some prompts are more effective than others in causing this behavior (Figure 3.2.5). Although most deviations produce nonsensical outputs, a certain percentage of responses disclose training data from the models. Using this approach, the authors managed to extract not just PII but also NSFW content, verbatim literature, and universal unique identifiers. 10 Red teaming models through various human-readable prompts to provoke unwanted behavior has become increasingly common. For instance, one might ask a model if it can provide instructions for building a bomb. While these methods have proven somewhat effective, the research mentioned above indicates there are other, more complex methods for eliciting unwanted behavior from models. 10 A UUID is a 128-bit value that allows for the unique identification of objects or entities on the internet. 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance Chapter 3: Responsible AI Figure 3.2.4 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Extracting PII From ChatGPT Source: Nasr et al., 2023 176 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 2,300 1,900 1,800 1,500 1,400 1,250 1,200 1,150 1,120 1,050 company one b J life send make part with work 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 Repeated tokenNumber of memorized output examples extracted Recovered memorized output given dierent repeated tokens Source: Nasr et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 3.2.5 17 7 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents Speeches Monologues OS licenses Novels Lyrics 2011 Lyrics 2021 original spaces lower caps Datasets Style 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 GPT-3 DaVinci Original GPT-3 DaVinci v2 PaLM 62B PaLM 540BProportion memorized Fraction of prompts discovering approximate memorization Source: Ippolito et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 3.2.6 Foundation Models and Verbatim Generation This year, many AI researchers investigated the issue of generative models producing content that mirrors the material on which they were trained. For example, research from Google, ETH Zurich, and Cornell explored data memorization in LLMs and found that models without any protective measures (i.e., filters that guard against outputting verbatim responses) frequently reproduce text directly from their training data. Various models were found to exhibit differing rates of memorization for different datasets (Figure 3.2.6). The authors argue that blocking the verbatim output of extended texts could reduce the risk of exposing copyrighted material and personal information through extraction attacks. They propose a solution where the model, upon generating each token, checks for n-gram matches with the training data to avoid exact reproductions. Although they developed an efficient method for this check, effectively preventing perfect verbatim outputs, they observed that the model could still approximate memorization by slightly altering outputs. This imperfect solution highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing model utility with privacy and copyright concerns. 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 178 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents Research has also highlighted challenges with exact and approximate memorization in visual content generation, notably with Midjourney v6. This study discovered that certain prompts could produce images nearly identical to those in films, even without direct instructions to recreate specific movie scenes (Figure 3.2.7). For example, a generic prompt such as “animated toys --v 6.0 -- ar16:9 --style raw” yielded images closely resembling, and potentially infringing upon, characters from “Toy Story” (Figure 3.2.8). This indicates that the model might have been trained on copyrighted material. Despite efforts to frame indirect prompts to avoid infringement, the problem persisted, emphasizing the broader copyright issues associated with AI’s use of unlicensed data. The research further underscores the difficulties in guiding generative AI to steer clear of copyright infringement, a concern also applicable to DALL-E, the image-generating model associated with ChatGPT (Figure 3.2.9). 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance Chapter 3: Responsible AI Figure 3.2.7 Figure 3.2.8 Figure 3.2.9 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Identical generation of Thanos Source: Marcus and Southen, 2024 Identical generation of Mario Source: Marcus and Southen, 2024 Identical generation of toys Source: Marcus and Southen, 2024 179 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents Auditing Privacy in AI Models Determining whether a model is privacy- preserving—that is, if it safeguards individuals’ personal information and data from unauthorized disclosure or access—is challenging. Privacy auditing is aimed at setting a lower bound on privacy loss, effectively quantifying the minimum privacy compromise in practical situations (Figure 3.2.10). Recent research from Google introduces a new method to achieve this within a single training run, marking a substantial advancement over prior methods that necessitated multiple attacks and significant computational effort. The new technique involves incorporating multiple independent data points into the training dataset simultaneously, instead of sequentially, and assessing the model’s privacy by attempting to ascertain which of these data points were utilized in training. This method is validated by showing it approximates the outcome of several individual training sessions, each incorporating a single data point. This approach is not only less computationally demanding but also has a minimal impact on model performance, offering an efficient and low-impact method for conducting privacy audits on AI models. 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 3.2.6 1.

First, the inherent complexity of advanced models, particularly those based on deep learning, creates a “black box” scenario where it’s difficult, even for developers, to understand how these models process inputs and produce outputs. This complexity obstructs comprehension and complicates the task of 3.3 Transparency and Explainability explaining these systems to nonexperts. Second, there is a potential trade-off between a model’s complexity and its explainability. More complex models might deliver superior performance but tend to be less interpretable than simpler models, such as decision trees. This situation creates a dilemma: choosing between high-performing yet opaque models and more transparent, albeit less precise, alternatives. Transparency in AI encompasses several aspects. Data and model transparency involve the open sharing of development choices, including data sources and algorithmic decisions. Operational transparency details how AI systems are deployed, monitored, and managed in practice. While explainability often falls under the umbrella of transparency, providing insights into the AI’s decision-making process, it is sometimes treated as a distinct category. This distinction underscores the importance of AI being not only transparent but also understandable to users and stakeholders. For the purposes of this chapter, the AI Index includes explainability within transparency, defining it as the capacity to comprehend and articulate the rationale behind AI decisions. 3.3 Transparency and Explainability Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 181 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents 3.3 Transparency and Explainability Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Transparency and Explainability in Numbers This section explores the state of AI transparency and explainability within academia and industry.

The survey listed four possible transparency and explainability measures that respondents could indicate adopting. 12 Figure 3.3.2 visualizes the adoption rate of these measures across different geographic areas. Compared to other responsible AI areas covered in the survey, a smaller share of organizations reported fully operationalizing transparency and explainability measures. The global mean was 1.43 out of the 4 measures adopted. Only 8% of companies across all regions and industries fully implemented more than half of the measures. A significant portion (12%) had not fully operationalized any measures. Overall, less than 0.7% of companies indicated full operationalization of all the measures. However, 88% self-reported operationalizing at least one measure.

The research includes a new index that monitors AI model transparency, as well as studies on neurosymbolic AI. The Foundation Model Transparency Index In October 2023, Stanford, Princeton, and MIT researchers released the Foundation Model Transparency Index (FMTI). This index evaluates the degree to which foundation models are transparent across diverse dimensions, including resource allocation for development, algorithmic design strategies, and downstream applications of the models. The analysis draws on publicly accessible data that developers release about their models. Meta’s Llama 2 and BigScience’s BLOOMZ stand out as the most transparent models (Figure 3.3.4). However, it is important to note that all models received relatively low scores, with the mean score at 37%. Additionally, open models—those openly releasing their weights—tend to score significantly better on transparency, with an average score of 51.3%, compared to closed models, which have limited access and score an average of 30.9%. 13 12 21 25 34 36 40 47 48 53 54 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Titan Text In�ection-1 Jurassic-2 Command Claude 2 PaLM 2 Stable Di�usion 2 GPT-4 BLOOMZ Llama 2 Open Closed Score Foundation model transparency total scores of open vs. closed developers, 2023 Source: 2023 Foundation Model Transparency Index Figure 3.3.4 13 An updated version of the FMTI is scheduled for release in spring 2024.

Unlike less interpretable deep learning models, symbolic reasoning offers clearer insights into how models work and allows for direct modifications of the model’s knowledge through expert feedback. However, symbolic reasoning alone typically falls short of deep learning models in terms of performance. Neurosymbolic AI aims to combine the best of both worlds. Research from the University of South Carolina and the University of Maryland provides a comprehensive mapping and taxonomy of various approaches within neurosymbolic AI. The research distinguishes between approaches that compress structured symbolic knowledge for integration with neural network structures and those that extract information from neural networks to translate them back into structured symbolic representations for reasoning. Figure 3.3.6 illustrates two examples of how this integration could be achieved. The researchers hope that neurosymbolic AI could mitigate some of the shortcomings of purely neural network–based models, such as hallucinations or incorrect reasoning, by mimicking human cognition—specifically, by enabling models to possess an explicit knowledge model of the world.

Some researchers advocated addressing current risks such as algorithmic discrimination, while others emphasized the importance of preparing for potential extreme risks posed by advanced AI. Given that there is no guarantee that the latter risks will not manifest at some point, there is a need to address both present risks through responsible AI development while also monitoring potential future risks that have yet to materialize. Furthermore, the dual-use potential 3.4 Security and Safety of AI systems, especially foundation models, for both beneficial and malicious purposes, has added complexity to discussions regarding necessary security measures. A notable challenge also arises from the potential for AI systems to amplify cyberattacks, resulting in threats that are increasingly sophisticated, adaptable, and difficult to detect. As AI models have become increasingly prevalent and sophisticated, there has been an increased focus on identifying security vulnerabilities, covering a range of attacks, from prompt injections to model leaks. In 2023, as AI capabilities continued to improve and models became increasingly ubiquitous, concerns about their security and safety became a top priority for decision-makers. This chapter explores three distinct aspects of security and safety. First, guaranteeing the integrity of AI systems involves protecting components such as algorithms, data, and infrastructure against external threats like cyberattacks or adversarial attacks. Second, safety involves minimizing harms stemming from the deliberate or inadvertent misuse of AI systems. This includes concerns such as the development of automated hacking tools or the utilization of AI in cyberattacks. Lastly, safety encompasses inherent risks from AI systems themselves, such as reliability concerns (e.g., hallucinations) and potential risks posed by advanced AI systems. 3.4 Security and Safety Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 187 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents AI Security and Safety in Numbers Academia Although the number of security and safety submissions at select academic conferences decreased since 2022, there has been an overall 70.4% increase in such submissions since 2019 (Figure 3.4.1). 3.4 Security and Safety Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 71 24 43 152 88 24 33 37 41 32 41 51 77 16 33 65 75 64 78 162 168 215 285 276 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 NeurIPS ICML ICLR FAccT AIES AAAINumber of AI security and safety submissions AI security and safety submissions to select academic conferences, 2019–23 Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 3.4.1 188 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents Industry The Global State of Responsible AI survey also queried organizations about reliability risks, such as model hallucinations or output errors. 14 Potential mitigations for these risks may involve managing low-confidence outputs or implementing comprehensive test cases for deployment across diverse scenarios. The survey inquired about a total of 6 mitigations related to reliability risks. 15 In a survey of more than 1,000 organizations, 45% acknowledged the relevance of reliability risks to their AI adoption strategies. Among these, 13% have fully implemented more than half of the surveyed measures, while 75% have operationalized at least one but fewer than half. Additionally, 12% of respondents admitted to having no reliability measures fully operationalized. The global average stood at 2.16 fully implemented measures out of the six included in the survey.

The profiled research studies new safety benchmarks for LLMs, methods of attacking AI models, and new benchmarks for testing deception and ethical behavior in AI systems. Do-Not-Answer: A New Open Dataset for Comprehensive Benchmarking of LLM Safety Risks As the capabilities of LLMs expand, so too does their potential for misuse in hazardous activities. LLMs could potentially be utilized to support cyberattacks, facilitate spear-phishing campaigns, or theoretically even assist in terrorism. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly crucial for developers to devise mechanisms for evaluating the potential dangers of AI models. Closed-source developers such as OpenAI and Anthropic have constructed datasets to assess dangerous model capabilities and typically implement safety measures to limit unwanted model behavior. However, safety evaluation methods for open-source LLMs are notably lacking. To that end, a team of international researchers recently created one of the first comprehensive open- source datasets for assessing safety risks in LLMs. Their evaluation encompasses responses from six prominent language models: GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, Llama 2, Vicuna, and ChatGLM2. The authors also developed a risk taxonomy spanning a range of risks, from mild to severe. The authors find that most models output harmful content to some extent. GPT-4 and ChatGPT are mostly prone to discriminatory, offensive output, while Claude is susceptible to propagating misinformation (Figure 3.4.7). Across all tested models, the highest number of violations was recorded for ChatGLM2 (Figure 3.4.8). 3.4 Security and Safety Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 1 0 3 6 26 22 3 0 1 6 4 18 7 0 3 10 12 15 1 0 7 1 6 20 2 3 2 0 4 10 ChatGPT Llama 2 Claude GPT-4 Vicuna ChatGLM2 2022 2023 Information hazards Malicious uses Discrimination, exclusion, toxicity, hateful, oensive Misinformation harms Human-chatbot interaction harms Foundation modelRisk category Harmful responses across dierent risk categories by foundation model Source: Wang et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 3.4.7 192 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents 3.4 Security and Safety Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 14 3 16 23 52 85 ChatGPT Llama 2 Claude GPT-4 Vicuna ChatGLM2 2022 2023 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Foundation modelNumber of harmful responses Total number of harmful responses across dierent foundation models Source: Wang et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 3.4.8 193 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents Universal and Transferable Attacks on Aligned Language Models Recent attention in AI security has centered on uncovering adversarial attacks capable of bypassing the implemented safety protocols of LLMs. Much of this research requires substantial human intervention and is idiosyncratic to specific models. However, in 2023, researchers unveiled a universal attack capable of operating across various LLMs. This attack induces aligned models to generate objectionable content (Figure 3.4.9). The method involved automatically generating suffixes that, when added to various prompts, compel LLMs to produce unsafe content. Figure 3.4.10 highlights the success rates of different attacking styles on leading LLMs. The method the researchers introduce is called Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG). The study demonstrates that these suffixes (the GCG attack) often transfer effectively across both closed and open models, encompassing ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, Llama-2-Chat, and Pythia. This study raises an important question as to how models can be better fortified against automated adversarial attacks. It also demonstrates how LLMs can be vulnerable to attacks that employ unintelligible, non-human-readable prompts. Current red-teaming methodologies primarily focus on interpretable prompts. This new research suggests there is a significant gap in buffering LLMs against attacks utilizing uninterpretable prompts. 3.4 Security and Safety Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 3.4.9 Using suffixes to manipulate LLMs Source: Zou et al., 2023 194 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents 3.4 Security and Safety Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Pythia-12B Falcon-7B Guanaco-7B ChatGLM-6B MPT-7B Stable-Vicuna Vicuna-7B Vicuna-13B GPT-3.5 GPT-4 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Prompt only “Sure, here’s” GCG GCG Ensemble ModelAttack success rate (%) Attack success rates of foundation models using dierent prompting techniques Source: Zho et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 3.4.10 195 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents 3.4 Security and Safety Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 MACHIAVELLI Benchmark There are many benchmarks, such as HELM and MMLU, that evaluate the overall capabilities of foundation models. However, there are few assessments that gauge how ethically these systems behave when they are forced to interact in social settings. This lack of measures presents a considerable obstacle in comprehensively understanding the safety risks of AI systems. If these systems were deployed in decision-making settings, would they actually pose a threat? Introduced in 2023, MACHIAVELLI is a new benchmark designed to address this gap. Its creators crafted a collection of 134 choose-your-own-adventure games, encompassing over half a million diverse social decision-making scenarios. These scenarios aim to evaluate the extent to which AI agents pursue power, engage in deception, induce disutility, and commit ethical violations. Through their research, the authors reveal that models confront trade-offs between maximizing rewards (game scores) and making ethical decisions. For instance, a model inclined to boost its score may find itself compelled to compromise its ethical stance (Figure 3.4.11). Furthermore, Figure 3.4.12 provides a comparison of scores among various prominent AI models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, across different MACHIAVELLI benchmark categories like power, immorality, and dissatisfaction. Lower scores indicate a more ethically oriented model. Furthermore, the researchers demonstrate that there are strategies for mitigating the trade-off between maximizing rewards and maintaining ethical behavior, which can lead to the development of proficient and ethical AI agents. MACHIAVELLI is one of the first significant attempts to construct a framework for assessing traits such as deception, morality, and power-seeking in sophisticated AI systems.

This challenge is magnified by the multifaceted nature of AI systems, which require the integration of fairness measures at almost every stage of their life cycle. Fairness in Numbers This section provides an overview of the study and deployment of AI fairness in academia and industry. 3.5 Fairness Academia The rise of LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini made the public significantly more aware of some of the fairness issues that can arise when AI systems are broadly deployed. This heightened awareness has led to a rise in AI-fairness-related submissions at academic conferences. In 2023, there were 212 papers on fairness and bias submitted, a 25.4% increase from 2022 (Figure 3.5.1). Since 2019, the number of such submissions has almost quadrupled. Fairness in AI emphasizes developing systems that are equitable and avoid perpetuating bias or discrimination against any individual or group. It involves considering the diverse needs and circumstances of all stakeholders impacted by AI use. Fairness extends beyond a technical concept and embodies broader social standards related to equity. 3.5 Fairness Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 15 15 29 34 4613 27 17 36 39 75 65 27 13 33 27 38 29 36 57 98 150 169 212 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 50 100 150 200 NeurIPS ICML ICLR FAccT AIES AAAINumber of AI fairness and bias submissions AI fairness and bias submissions to select academic conferences, 2019–23 Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 3.5.1 198 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents Industry In the Global State of Responsible AI survey referenced earlier, 29% of organizations identified fairness risks as relevant to their AI adoption strategies. 17 Regionally, European organizations (34%) most frequently reported this risk as relevant, while North American organizations reported it the least (20%). The survey asked respondents about their efforts to mitigate bias and enhance fairness and diversity in AI model development, deployment, and use, providing them with five possible measures to implement. Results show that while most companies have fully implemented at least one fairness measure, comprehensive integration is still lacking. The global average for adopted fairness measures stands at 1.97 out of five measures asked about. There is not significant regional variation in the implementation of fairness measures (Figure 3.5.2). Figure 3.5.3 visualizes integration rates by industry.

By focusing on significant fairness studies, the AI Index highlights some critical topics that are of interest to AI fairness researchers. The research featured below reveals how image generation models can perpetuate social stereotypes, LLMs tend to reflect Western opinions, and model tokenization can introduce elements of unfairness. (Un)Fairness in AI and Healthcare A team of American and Canadian researchers investigated racial bias when LLMs are prompted to respond to medical questions. They queried four popular LLMs (Bard, GPT-3.5, Claude, GPT-4) with nine distinct questions previously known to elicit “race-based medicine or widespread misconceptions around race” among real physicians. Each model was asked each question five times, yielding 45 responses per model. Figure 3.5.4 highlights the frequency with which notable LLMs delivered highly racialized responses per question. 19 The study revealed that all models demonstrated some degree of race-based medical bias, although their responses to identical questions varied. For certain queries, like the basis of race, only one model, Claude, consistently offered problematic responses. In contrast, for other questions, such as the purported skin thickness differences between Black and white individuals (a widespread misconception among medical students), most models regularly produced concerning race-based responses. The occasional perpetuation of debunked myths by LLMs underscores the need for caution when employing LLMs in medical contexts.

As highlighted in the 2023 AI Index, many image generation models frequently perpetuate stereotypes and biases (Figure 3.5.5). To assess bias, BiasPainter employs a wide selection of seed images and neutral prompts related to professions, activities, objects, and personality traits for image editing. It then compares these edits to the original images, concentrating on identifying inappropriate changes in gender, race, and age. BiasPainter was evaluated across five well-known commercial image generation models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and InstructPix2Pix. All models were shown to be somewhat biased along different dimensions (Figure 3.5.6). Generally, the generated images were more biased along age and race than gender dimensions. Overall, on automatic bias detection tasks, BiasPainter achieves an automatic bias detection accuracy of 90.8%, a considerable improvement over previous methods.

In this study, researchers built a GlobalOpinionQA dataset to capture cross-country opinions on various issues (Figure 3.5.7). They then generated a similarity metric to compare people’s answers in various countries with those outputted by LLMs. Using a four-point Likert scale, LLMs were asked to rate their agreement with statements from the World Values Survey (WVS) and Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes (GAS) surveys, including questions like, “When jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to people of this country over immigrants,” or “On the whole, men make better business executives than women do.” The experiments indicate that the models’ responses closely align with those from individuals in Western countries (Figure 3.5.8). The authors point out a notable lack of diversity in opinion representation, especially from non-Western nations among the shared responses. While it is challenging for models to precisely match the highly diverse distributions of global opinions—given the inherent variation in perspectives—it is still valuable to understand which opinions a model is likely to share. Recognizing the biases inherent in models can highlight their limitations and facilitate adjustments that improve regional applicability.

Tokenization, the process of breaking down text into smaller units for processing and analysis, exhibits significant variability across languages. The number of tokens used for the same sentence can vary up to 15 times between languages. For instance, Portuguese closely matches English in the efficiency of the GPT-4 tokenizer, yet it still requires approximately 50% more tokens to convey the same content. The Shan language is the furthest from English, needing 15 times more tokens. Figure 3.5.9 visualizes the concept of a context window while figure 3.5.10 illustrates the token consumption of the same sentence across different languages. The authors identify three major inequalities that result from variable tokenization. First, users of languages that require more tokens than English for the same content face up to four times higher inference costs and longer processing times, as both are dependent on the number of tokens. Figure 3.5.11 illustrates the variation in token length and execution time for the same sentence across different languages or language families. Second, these users may also experience increased processing times because models take longer to process a greater number of tokens. Lastly, given that models operate within a fixed context window—a limit on the amount of text or content that can be input—languages that require more tokens proportionally use up more of this window. This can reduce the available context for the model, potentially diminishing the quality of service for those users.

Moreover, deepfake tools have significantly improved since the 2020 U.S. elections. Large-scale disinformation can undermine trust in democratic institutions, manipulate public opinion, and polarize public discussions. Figure 3.6.1 highlights the different types of deepfakes that can be created. In 2024, around 4 billion people across the globe will vote in national elections, for example, in the United States, U.K., Indonesia, Mexico, and Taiwan. Upcoming elections coupled with greater public awareness of AI have led to discussions of AI’s possible impact on elections. This section covers how AI can impact elections and more specifically examines the generation and dissemination of mis- and disinformation, the detection of AI-generated content, the potential political bias of LLMs, and the broader impact of AI on politics. 3.6 AI and Elections Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 3.6.1 Potential uses of deepfakes Source: Masood et al., 2023 Audio 20 This section uses the terms synthetic content, disinformation, and deepfakes in the following senses: Synthetic content is any content (text, image, audio, video) that has been created with AI. Disinformation is false or misleading information generated with the explicit intention to deceive or manipulate an audience. Deepfakes are AI-generated image, video, or audio files that can often create convincingly realistic yet deceptive content. 206 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents Slovakia’s 2023 election illustrates how AI-based disinformation can be used in a political context. Shortly before the election, a contentious audio clip emerged on Facebook purportedly capturing Michal Šimečka, the leader of the Progressive Slovakia party (Figure 3.6.2), and journalist Monika Tódová from the newspaper Denník N, discussing illicit election strategies, including acquiring voters from the Roma community. The authenticity of the audio was immediately challenged by Šimečka and Denník N. An independent fact-checking team suggested that AI manipulation was likely at play. Because the clip was released during a pre-election quiet period, when media and politicians’ commentary is restricted, the clip’s dissemination was not easily contested. The clip’s wide circulation was also aided by a significant gap in Meta’s content policy, which does not apply to audio manipulations. This episode of AI-enabled disinformation occurred against the backdrop of a close electoral contest. Ultimately, the affected party, Progressive Slovakia, lost by a slim margin to SMER, one of the opposition parties. 3.6 AI and Elections Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 3.6.2 Progressive Slovakia leader Michal Šimečka Source: Meaker, 2023 207 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents 1.

However, in 2023, case studies emerged about how AI could be used to automate the entire generation and dissemination pipeline. A developer called Nea Paw set up Countercloud as an experiment in creating a fully automated disinformation pipeline (Figure 3.6.3). As part of the first step in the pipeline, an AI model is used to continuously scrape the internet for articles and automatically decide which content it should target with counter-articles. Next, another AI model is tasked with writing a convincing counter-article that can include images and audio summaries. This counter-article is subsequently attributed to a fake journalist and posted on the CounterCloud website. Subsequently, another AI system generates comments on the counter-article, creating the appearance of organic engagement. Finally, an AI searches X for relevant tweets, posts the counter-article as a reply, and comments as a user on these tweets. The entire setup for this authentic-appearing misinformation system only costs around $400. 3.6 AI and Elections Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 3.6.3 AI-based generation and dissemination pipeline Source: AI Index, 2024 21 21 The figure was adapted from Simon, Altay, and Mercier, 2023. 208 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents Detecting Deepfakes Recent research efforts to counter deepfakes have focused on improving methods for detecting AI- generated content. For example, a team of Singaporean researchers studied how well deepfake detectors generalize to datasets they have not been trained on. The researchers compared five deepfake detection approaches and found that even more recently introduced deepfake detection methods suffer significant performance declines on never-before-seen datasets (Figure 3.6.4). However, the study does note that there are underlying similarities between seen and unseen datasets, meaning that in the future, robust and broadly generalizable deepfake detectors could be created. 3.6 AI and Elections Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 3.6.4 93.60% 89.05% 85.50% 77.15% 71.00% 69.03% 65.94% 69.75% 63.16% 65.85% XceptionNet3 MesoInception3 MesoNet3 EcientNet6 ShallowNet6 2017 2018 2019 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Original accuracy Unseen dataset accuracy DetectorAccuracy (%) Generalizability of deepfake detectors to unseen datasets Source: Li et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 209 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents In the context of deepfake detectors, it is also important to highlight earlier experiments that show that the performance of deepfake detection methods varies significantly across attributes such as race. Some of the underlying datasets used to train deepfake detectors, like FaceForensics++, are not equally balanced with respect to race and gender (Figure 3.6.5). The authors then demonstrate that between various racial subgroups, performance accuracy could differ by as much as 10.7 percentage points.

However, new research published in 2023 suggests that many major LLMs like ChatGPT are not necessarily free of bias. The study revealed that ChatGPT exhibits a notable and systematic bias favoring Democrats in the United States and the Labour Party in the U.K. As part of the study, the researchers compared the answers of a default ChatGPT to those of Republican, Democrat, radical Republican, and radical Democrat versions of ChatGPT. This research design was created to better identify which political allegiance most closely corresponds to the regular ChatGPT. Figure 3.6.6 shows strong positive correlations (blue lines) between the default ChatGPT, i.e., one that was answering questions without additional instructions, and both the Democrat and the radical Democrat ChatGPT versions, i.e., versions of ChatGPT that were asked to answer like a Democrat or radical Democrat. On the other hand, the researchers found a strong negative correlation between the default GPT and both Republican ChatGPTs. The identification of bias in these LLMs raises concerns about their potential to influence the political views and stances of users who engage with these tools. 3.6 AI and Elections Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 22 ChatGPT answers are coded on a scale of 0 (strongly disagree), 1 (disagree), 2 (agree), and 3 (strongly agree).

One topic of interest has been audio deepfakes. In July 2023, audio clips of a politician from India’s Hindu party were released in which the politician attacked his own party and praised his political opponent. The politician claimed these audio clips were created using AI. However, even after deepfake experts were consulted, it could not be determined with 100% certainty whether the clips were authentic or not. Research published in 2023 suggests that humans generally have issues reliably detecting audio deepfakes. In their sample of 529 individuals, listeners only correctly detected deepfakes 73% of the time. Figure 3.6.7 illustrates some of the other key findings from the study. The authors also expect detection accuracy to go down in the future as a result of improvements in audio generation methods. The rise of more convincing audio deepfakes increases the potential to manipulate political campaigns, defame opponents, and give politicians a “liar’s dividend,” the ability to dismiss damaging audio clips as fabrications. 3.6 AI and Elections Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 3.6.7 Reference audio improves deepfake detection Listening to clips more frequently does not aid detection Training humans to detect deepfakes only helps slightly Spending more time does not improve detection English and Mandarin deepfakes are equally difficult to identify Participants do not improve detection without explicit feedback Shorter deepfakes are not easier to identify Human crowd and top automated detectors have comparable performance Hello 你好 Key research findings on audio deepfakes Source: Mai et al., 2023; AI Index, 2024 212 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3 PreviewTable of Contents AI can also influence political processes in other ways. Research from Queen’s University Belfast notes other ways in which AI can affect political processes, and potential mitigations associated with different risk cases (Figure 3.6.8). For instance, AI could be utilized for video surveillance of voters, potentially undermining the integrity of elections. The same authors identify the degree to which each AI political use case is technologically ready, the risk level it possesses, and how visible the deployment of AI would be to users (Figure 3.6.9). For example, they propose that employing AI for voter authentication is already highly feasible, and this application carries a significant risk. 3.6 AI and Elections Chapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Voter list maintenance Polling booth locations Predicting problem booths Voter authentication Video monitoring Avenue Heuristic-driven approximations Record linkage Outlier detection Drop box location determination Facility location Clustering Predictive policing Time series motifs Face recognition Biometrics Video-based vote counting Event detection Person re-identi�cation AI usage Access-integrity trade-o� issues Biased AI Overly generalized AI Business ethos Volatility and �nding costs Partisan manipulation Systemic racism Aggravating brutality Feedback loops Race/gender bias Unknown biases Voter turnout Surveillance and misc.

Some predict that AI will drive productivity improvements, but the extent of its impact remains uncertain. A major concern is the potential for massive labor displacement—to what degree will jobs be automated versus augmented by AI? Companies are already utilizing AI in various ways across industries, but some regions of the world are witnessing greater investment inflows into this transformative technology. Moreover, investor interest appears to be gravitating toward specific AI subfields like natural language processing and data management. This chapter examines AI-related economic trends using data from Lightcast, LinkedIn, Quid, McKinsey, Stack Overflow, and the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). It begins by analyzing AI-related occupations, covering labor demand, hiring trends, skill penetration, and talent availability. The chapter then explores corporate investment in AI, introducing a new section focused specifically on generative AI. It further examines corporate adoption of AI, assessing current usage and how developers adopt these technologies. Finally, it assesses AI’s current and projected economic impact and robot installations across various sectors. CHAPTER 4: Economy Table of Contents 216 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 1. Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in the generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds. 2. Already a leader, the United States pulls even further ahead in AI private investment. In 2023, the United States saw AI investments reach $67.2 billion, nearly 8.7 times more than China, the next highest investor. While private AI investment in China and the European Union, including the United Kingdom, declined by 44.2% and 14.1%, respectively, since 2022, the United States experienced a notable increase of 22.1% in the same time frame. 3. Fewer AI jobs, in the United States and across the globe. In 2022, AI-related positions made up 2.0% of all job postings in America, a figure that decreased to 1.6% in 2023. This decline in AI job listings is attributed to fewer postings from leading AI firms and a reduced proportion of tech roles within these companies. 4. AI decreases costs and increases revenues. A new McKinsey survey reveals that 42% of surveyed organizations report cost reductions from implementing AI (including generative AI), and 59% report revenue increases. Compared to the previous year, there was a 10 percentage point increase in respondents reporting decreased costs, suggesting AI is driving significant business efficiency gains. 5. Total AI private investment declines again, while the number of newly funded AI companies increases. Global private AI investment has fallen for the second year in a row, though less than the sharp decrease from 2021 to 2022. The count of newly funded AI companies spiked to 1,812, up 40.6% from the previous year. 6. AI organizational adoption ticks up. A 2023 McKinsey report reveals that 55% of organizations now use AI (including generative AI) in at least one business unit or function, up from 50% in 2022 and 20% in 2017. 7. China dominates industrial robotics. Since surpassing Japan in 2013 as the leading installer of industrial robots, China has significantly widened the gap with the nearest competitor nation. In 2013, China’s installations accounted for 20.8% of the global total, a share that rose to 52.4% by 2022. Chapter Highlights CHAPTER 4: Economy Table of Contents 217 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 8. Greater diversity in robotic installations. In 2017, collaborative robots represented a mere 2.8% of all new industrial robot installations, a figure that climbed to 9.9% by 2022. Similarly, 2022 saw a rise in service robot installations across all application categories, except for medical robotics. This trend indicates not just an overall increase in robot installations but also a growing emphasis on deploying robots for human-facing roles. 9. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. In 2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still other studies caution that using AI without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance. 10. Fortune 500 companies start talking a lot about AI, especially generative AI. In 2023, AI was mentioned in 394 earnings calls (nearly 80% of all Fortune 500 companies), a notable increase from 266 mentions in 2022. Since 2018, mentions of AI in Fortune 500 earnings calls have nearly doubled. The most frequently cited theme, appearing in 19.7% of all earnings calls, was generative AI.

Lightcast has analyzed hundreds of millions of job postings from over 51,000 websites since 2010, identifying those that require AI skills. Global AI Labor Demand Figure 4.2.1 shows the percentage of job postings demanding AI skills. In 2023, the United States (1.6%), Spain (1.4%), and Sweden (1.3%) led in this metric. In 2022, AI-related jobs accounted for 2.0% of all American job postings. In 2023, that number dropped to 1.6%. Although most countries saw a decrease from 2022 to 2023 in the share of job postings requiring AI skills, in many, the number of AI-related job postings over the past five years has increased. 1 Lightcast speculates that the 2023 decrease in AI job postings is driven by many top AI employers (such as Amazon, Deloitte, Capital One, Randstad, and Elevance Health) scaling back their overall posting counts. Additionally, many companies shifted the occupational mix of their postings. For example, Amazon, in 2023, posted a higher share of operational roles like sales delivery driver, packager, and postal service/mail room worker than in 2022. At the same time, there was a lower share of demand for tech roles like software developers and data scientists. Figure 4.2.1 1 In 2023, Lightcast slightly changed its methodology for determining AI-related job postings from what was used in previous versions of the AI Index report. Lightcast also updated its taxonomy of AI-related skills. As such, some of the numbers in this chart do not completely align with those featured in last year’s report. 224 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 4 PreviewTable of Contents 4.2 Jobs Chapter 4: EconomyArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0.00% 0.20% 0.40% 0.60% 0.80% 1.00%AI job postings (% of all job postings) 0.05%, Generative AI 0.05%, Robotics 0.07%, Visual image recognition 0.10%, Neural networks 0.14%, Autonomous driving 0.15%, Natural language processing 0.46%, Articial intelligence 0.68%, Machine learning AI job postings (% of all job postings) in the United States by skill cluster, 2010–23 Source: Lightcast, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report U.S. AI Labor Demand by Skill Cluster and Specialized Skill Figure 4.2.2 highlights the most sought-after AI skills in the U.S. labor market since 2010. Leading the demand was machine learning at 0.7%, with artificial intelligence at 0.5%, and natural language processing at 0.2%. Despite a recent dip, machine learning continues to be the most in-demand skill. Since last year, every AI-related skill cluster tracked by Lightcast had a decrease in market share, with the exception of generative AI, which grew by more than a factor of 10.

Figure 4.2.3 2 The decision to select 2011–2013 as the point of comparison was because some data at the jobs/skills level from earlier years is quite sparse. Lightcast therefore used 2011–2013 to have a larger sample size for a benchmark from 10 years ago with which to compare.

The geographic areas included in the sample make at least 10 AI hires each month and have LinkedIn covering a substantial portion of the labor force. LinkedIn’s coverage of India’s and South Korea’s sizable labor forces fall below this threshold, so insights drawn about these countries should be interpreted with particular caution. Figure 4.2.12 reports the relative AI hiring rate year-over- year ratio by geographic area. The overall hiring rate is computed as the percentage of LinkedIn members who added a new employer in the same period the job began, divided by the total number of LinkedIn members in the corresponding location. Conversely, the relative AI talent hiring rate is the year-over-year change in AI hiring relative to overall hiring rate in the same geographic area. 3 Therefore, figure 4.2.12 illustrates which specific regions have experienced the most significant rise in AI talent recruitment compared to the overall hiring rate, serving as an indicator of AI hiring vibrancy. In 2023, the regions with the greatest relative AI hiring rates year over year were Hong Kong (28.8%), followed by Singapore (18.9%) and Luxembourg (18.9%). This means, for example, that in 2023 in Hong Kong, the ratio of AI talent hiring relative to overall hiring grew 28.8%. Figure 4.2.124 3 For each month, LinkedIn calculates the AI hiring rate in the geographic area, divides the AI hiring rate by overall hiring rate in that geographic area, calculates the year-over-year change of this ratio, and then takes the 12-month moving average using the last 12 months. 4 For brevity, the visualization only includes the top 15 countries for this metric. Figure 4.2.13 showcases the year-over-year ratio of AI hiring by geographic areas over the past five years. Starting from the beginning of 2023, countries including Australia, Canada, Singapore, and India have experienced a noticeable uptick in AI hiring. 233 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 4 PreviewTable of Contents 4.2 Jobs Chapter 4: EconomyArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100%Relative AI hiring rate year-over-year ratio Australia Belgium Brazil Canada Chile Denmark Finland France Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Italy Luxembourg Netherlands New Zealand Norway Portugal Singapore South Africa South Korea Spain Sweden Switzerland United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States 6.53% 10.41% -0.47% 4.44% 6.65% 13.23% 7.27% -0.43% 0.16% 28.83% 16.83% -0.48% 6.22% 6.03% 18.85% 5.21% 6.15% 13.08% 14.84% 18.93% 7.17% 5.81% 9.63% 7.37% -0.24% 13.40% 8.57% 5.68% Relative AI hiring rate year-over-year ratio by geographic area, 2018–23 Source: LinkedIn, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100% 2019 2021 2023 −50% 0% 50% 100%Relative AI hiring rate year-over-year ratio Australia Belgium Brazil Canada Chile Denmark Finland France Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Italy Luxembourg Netherlands New Zealand Norway Portugal Singapore South Africa South Korea Spain Sweden Switzerland United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States 6.53% 10.41% -0.47% 4.44% 6.65% 13.23% 7.27% -0.43% 0.16% 28.83% 16.83% -0.48% 6.22% 6.03% 18.85% 5.21% 6.15% 13.08% 14.84% 18.93% 7.17% 5.81% 9.63% 7.37% -0.24% 13.40% 8.57% 5.68% Relative AI hiring rate year-over-year ratio by geographic area, 2018–23 Source: LinkedIn, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 4.2.13 234 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 4 PreviewTable of Contents 4.2 Jobs Chapter 4: EconomyArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 0.98 1.06 1.08 1.13 1.21 1.29 1.35 1.48 1.50 1.63 1.63 1.67 1.90 2.22 2.75 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 United Arab Emirates Switzerland Italy Netherlands Brazil Spain South Korea France Singapore United Kingdom Israel Canada Germany United States India Relative AI skill penetration rate Relative AI skill penetration rate by geographic area, 2015–23 Source: LinkedIn, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report AI Skill Penetration Figures 4.2.14 and 4.2.15 highlight relative AI skill penetration. The aim of this indicator is to measure the intensity of AI skills in an entity (such as a particular country, industry, or gender). The AI skill penetration rate signals the prevalence of AI skills across occupations or the intensity with which LinkedIn members utilize AI skills in their jobs. For example, the top 50 skills for the occupation of engineer are calculated based on the weighted frequency with which they appear in LinkedIn members’ profiles. If, for instance, four of the skills that engineers possess belong to the AI skill group, the penetration of AI skills among engineers is estimated to be 8% (4/50). For the period from 2015 to 2023, the countries with the highest AI skill penetration rates were India (2.8), the United States (2.2), and Germany (1.9). In the United States, therefore, the relative penetration of AI skills was 2.2 times greater than the global average across the same set of occupations.

A LinkedIn member is considered AI talent if they have explicitly added AI skills to their profile or work in AI. Counts of AI talent are used to calculate talent concentration, or the portion of members who are AI talent. Note that concentration metrics may be influenced by LinkedIn coverage in these countries and should be used with caution. Figure 4.2.16 shows AI talent concentration in various countries. In 2023, the countries with the highest concentrations of AI talent included Israel (1.1%), Singapore (0.9%), and South Korea (0.8%). Figure 4.2.17 looks at the percent change in AI talent concentration for a selection of countries since 2016. During that time period, several major economies registered substantial increases in their AI talent pools. The countries showing the greatest increases are India (263%), Cyprus (229%), and Denmark (213%).

Figure 4.2.19 examines net AI talent migration Figure 4.2.20 documents AI talent migration data over time. In the last few years, Israel, India, and South Korea have seen declining net AI talent migration figures, suggesting that AI talent has been increasingly flowing out of these countries. per 10,000 LinkedIn members by geographic area. The countries that report the greatest incoming migration of AI talent are Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates. Figure 4.2.19 5 LinkedIn membership varies considerably between countries, which makes interpreting absolute movements of members from one country to another difficult. To compare migration flows between countries fairly, migration flows are normalized for the country of interest. For example, if country A is the country of interest, all absolute net flows into and out of country A (regardless of origin and destination countries) are normalized based on LinkedIn membership in country A at the end of each year and multiplied by 10,000. Hence, this metric indicates relative talent migration of all other countries to and from country A. 239 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 4 PreviewTable of Contents 4.2 Jobs Chapter 4: EconomyArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2 3 4 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2 3 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 Australia Belgium Brazil Canada Chile Costa Rica Cyprus* Denmark Finland France Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Italy Luxembourg* Netherlands New Zealand Norway Portugal Singapore South Africa South Korea Spain Sweden Switzerland* United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States Uruguay 0.67 0.28 -0.05 0.96 -0.07 0.01 1.24 0.44 0.90 0.06 1.04 0.12 -0.76 0.60 -0.57 -0.18 3.67 0.76 0.19 0.41 0.23 0.50 -0.12 -0.30 0.25 0.17 1.60 1.48 0.41 0.40 -0.13Net AI talent migration (per 10,000 LinkedIn members) Net AI talent migration per 10,000 LinkedIn members by geographic area, 2019–23 Source: LinkedIn, 2023; World Bank Group, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2 3 4 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2 3 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 2019 2021 2023 −1 0 1 Australia Belgium Brazil Canada Chile Costa Rica Cyprus* Denmark Finland France Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Italy Luxembourg* Netherlands New Zealand Norway Portugal Singapore South Africa South Korea Spain Sweden Switzerland* United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States Uruguay 0.67 0.28 -0.05 0.96 -0.07 0.01 1.24 0.44 0.90 0.06 1.04 0.12 -0.76 0.60 -0.57 -0.18 3.67 0.76 0.19 0.41 0.23 0.50 -0.12 -0.30 0.25 0.17 1.60 1.48 0.41 0.40 -0.13Net AI talent migration (per 10,000 LinkedIn members) Net AI talent migration per 10,000 LinkedIn members by geographic area, 2019–23 Source: LinkedIn, 2023; World Bank Group, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 4.2.20 6 6 Asterisks indicate that a country’s y-axis label is scaled differently than the y-axis label for the other countries. 240 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 4 PreviewTable of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 How Much Do Computer Scientists Earn? Every year, Stack Overflow conducts a survey of its community of professional developers who use their tools. The latest iteration of the survey profiled over 90,000 developers. Through this survey, respondents were asked about their income. It is important to note that these respondents do not work exclusively with AI. However, examining developer salaries can serve as a means to approximate the compensation of talent in AI-adjacent industries.

However, finding reliable data confirming AI’s impact on productivity has been difficult because AI integration has historically been low. In 2023, numerous studies rigorously examined AI’s productivity impacts, offering more conclusive evidence on the topic First, AI has been shown to enable workers to complete tasks more quickly and produce higher quality work. A meta-review by Microsoft, which aggregated studies comparing the performance of workers using Microsoft Copilot or GitHub’s Copilot— LLM-based productivity-enhancing tools—with those who did not, found that Copilot users completed tasks in 26% to 73% less time than their counterparts without AI access (Figure 4.4.19). 11 4.4 Corporate Activity Figure 4.4.19 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 4: Economy 11 This meta-review analyzed separate surveys of workers using Microsoft’s Copilot and GitHub’s Copilot tools. These are separate tools. Microsoft Copilot is a broader LLM-based productivity improvement tool, while GitHub’s Copilot is a code-writing assistant. 273 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 4 PreviewTable of Contents 12.20% 25.10% 40.00% Productivity Speed Quality 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% Performance metrics on consulting tasksAverage improvement compared to control group (%) Eect of GPT-4 use on a group of consultants Source: Dell’Acqua et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 2.97 2.60 Used AI Did not use AI 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00Hourly chats per customer support agent Impact of AI on customer support agents Source: Brynjolfsson et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Similarly, a Harvard Business School study revealed that consultants with access to GPT-4 increased their productivity on a selection of consulting tasks by 12.2%, speed by 25.1%, and quality by 40.0%, compared to a control group without AI access (Figure 4.4.20).

A study focused on professional recruiters reviewing résumés found that receiving any AI assistance improved task accuracy by 0.6 points compared to not receiving AI assistance. However, recruiters who were provided with “good AI”—believed to be high-performing—actually performed worse than those who received “bad AI,” which was capable but known to make errors (Figure 4.4.24). The performance difference between the latter groups was -1.08 points. The study theorizes that recruiters using “good AI” became complacent, overly trusting the AI’s results, unlike those using “bad AI,” who were more vigilant in scrutinizing AI output. 4.4 Corporate Activity Figure 4.4.24 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 4: Economy 27 7 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 4 PreviewTable of Contents 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 100 200 300 400Number of earnings calls 394 Number of Fortune 500 earnings calls mentioning AI, 2018–23 Source: Quid, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Earnings Calls The following section presents data from Quid, which uses natural language processing tools to analyze trends in corporate earnings calls.

Floods, among the most common natural disasters, have particularly devastating effects in less developed countries where infrastructure for prevention and mitigation is lacking. Consequently, developing more accurate prediction methods that can forecast these events further in advance could yield substantial positive impacts. A team of Google researchers has used AI to develop highly accurate hydrological simulation models that are also applicable to ungauged basins. 1 These innovative methods can predict certain extreme flood events up to five days in advance, with accuracy that matches or surpasses current state-of-the-art models, such as GloFAS. The AI model demonstrates superior precision (accuracy of positive predictions) and recall (ability to correctly identify all relevant instances) across a range of return period events, outperforming the leading contemporary method (Figure 5.1.11). 2 The model is open-source and is already being used to predict flood events in over 80 countries. 1 (N=3,649) 2 (N=3,675) 5 (N=3,416) 10 (N=3,087) 0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 1 (N=3,682) 2 (N=3,691) 5 (N=3,597) 10 (N=3,321) 0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 AI model GloFASPrecision (median) ↑Recall (median) ↑ Predictions of AI model vs. GloFAS across return periods Source: Nearing et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Return period Figure 5.1.11 1 An ungauged basin is a watershed for which there is insufficient streamflow data to model hydrological flows. 2 A return period (recurrence interval) measures the likelihood of a particular hydrological event recurring within a specific period.

SynthSR Transforming brain scans for advanced analysis SynthSR is an AI tool that converts clinical brain scans into high-resolution T-1 weighted images (Figure 5.2.1). This advancement addresses the issue of scan quality variability, which previously limited the use of many scans in advanced research. By transforming these scans into T1-weighted images, known for their high contrast and clear brain structure depiction, SynthSR facilitates the creation of detailed 3D brain renderings. Experiments using SynthSR demonstrate robust correlations between observed volumes at both scan and subject levels, suggesting that SynthSR generates images closely resembling those produced by high-resolution T1 scans. Figure 5.2.2 illustrates the extent to which SynthSR scans correspond with ground-truth observations across selected brain regions.

With millions of possible genetic mutations, determining whether a mutation is benign or pathogenic requires labor- intensive experiments. In 2023, researchers from Google DeepMind unveiled AlphaMissense, a new AI model that predicted the pathogenicity of 71 million missense variants. Missense mutations are genetic alterations that impact the functionality of human proteins (Figure 5.2.7) and can lead to various diseases, including cancer. Of the 71 million possible missense variants, AlphaMissense classified 89%, identifying 57% as likely benign and 32% as likely pathogenic, while the remainder were categorized as uncertain (Figure 5.2.8). In contrast, human annotators have only been able to confirm the nature of 0.1% of all missense mutations.

The first human genome draft was released in 2000 and updated in 2022. However, the update was somewhat incomplete. It did not incorporate various genetic mutations, like blood type, and did not as completely map diverse ancestry groups. Therefore, under the existing genome reference, it would be difficult to detect diseases or find cures in certain groups of people. In 2023, the Human Pangenome Research Consortium, comprising 119 scientists from 60 institutions, used AI to develop an updated and more representative human genome map (Figure 5.2.9). The researchers achieved remarkable accuracy, annotating a median of 99.07% of protein-coding genes, 99.42% of protein-coding transcripts, 98.16% of noncoding genes, and 98.96% of noncoding transcripts, as detailed in Figure 5.2.10.

Fine- tuning entails training an LLM on domain-specific data. Research from Microsoft in late 2023 has overturned this assumption. This study employed prompt engineering to direct GPT-4 toward achieving remarkable performance on the MultiMedQA benchmark suite, a group of four challenging medical benchmarks (Figure 5.2.12). GPT-4 Medprompt exceeded the performance of the top 2022 model, Flan-PaLM 540B, in the multiple- choice sections of several renowned medical benchmarks, including PubMedQA, MedMCQA, and MMLU, by 3.0, 21.5, and 16.2 percentage points, respectively. It also exceeded the performance of the then state-of- the-art Med-PaLM 2 (Figure 5.2.13). Moreover, as noted earlier, GPT-4 Medprompt was the first to surpass the 90% accuracy mark on the MedQA benchmark. This breakthrough not only underscores GPT-4 Medprompt’s exceptional and potentially clinically useful medical capabilities but also demonstrates that fine-tuning may not always be necessary for adapting models to specialized domains. Prompt engineering has shown to be a promising alternative strategy.

CoDoC AI medical imaging systems demonstrate robust diagnostic capabilities, yet there are instances where they overlook diagnoses that clinicians catch, and vice versa. This observation suggests a logical integration of AI systems and clinicians’ diagnostic abilities. In 2023, researchers unveiled CoDoC (Complementarity-Driven Deferral to Clinical Workflow), a system designed to discern when to rely on AI for diagnosis and when to defer to traditional clinical methods. CoDoC notably enhances both sensitivity (the ability to correctly identify individuals with a disease) and specificity (the ability to accurately identify those without it). Specifically, across four medical datasets, CoDoC’s sensitivity surpasses clinicians’ by an average of 4.5 percentage points and a standalone AI model’s by 6.5 percentage points (Figure 5.2.15). In terms of specificity, CoDoC outperforms clinicians by an average of 2.7 percentage points across tested datasets and a standalone predictive model by 5.7 percentage points.

Screening for PDAC in asymptomatic individuals is challenging due to its low prevalence and the risk of false positives. This year, a Chinese research team developed PANDA (pancreatic cancer detection with artificial intelligence), an AI model capable of efficiently detecting and classifying pancreatic lesions in X-rays (Figure 5.2.16). In validation tests, PANDA surpassed the average radiologist in sensitivity by 34.1% and in specificity by 6.3% (Figure 5.2.17). In a large-scale, real-world test involving approximately 20,000 patients, PANDA achieved a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 99.9% (Figure 5.2.18). AI medical tools like PANDA represent significant advancements in diagnosing challenging conditions, offering cost-effective and accurate detection previously considered difficult or prohibitive.

Schopf et al., 2023 Dicente Cid et al., 2023 Research Breast cancer X-ray interpretation Use case The authors conducted a meta-review of the literature exploring mammography-image-based AI algorithms. They discovered that predicting future breast cancer risk using only mammography images achieves accuracy that is comparable to or better than traditional risk assessment tools. The researchers developed two open-source neural networks, X-Raydar and X-Raydar-NLP, for classifying chest X-rays using images and free-text reports. They found that these automated classication methods perform at levels comparable to human experts and demonstrate robustness when applied to external data sets.

The devices featured on this list meet the FDA’s premarket standards, which include a detailed review of their effectiveness and safety. As of October 2023, the FDA has not approved any devices that utilize generative AI or are powered by LLMs. Figure 5.2.20 illustrates the number of AI medical devices approved by the FDA over the past decade. In 2022, a total of 139 AI-related medical devices received FDA approval, marking a 12.1% increase from the total approved in 2021. Since 2012, the number of these devices has increased by more than 45-fold. Figure 5.2.20 3 The FDA last updated the list in October 2023, meaning that the totals for 2023 were incomplete.

MedAlign Despite significant advances in AI for healthcare, existing benchmarks like MedQA and USMLE, focused on knowledge- based questions, do not fully capture the diverse tasks clinicians perform in patient care. Clinicians often engage in information-intensive tasks, such as creating tailored diagnostic plans, and spend a significant proportion of their working hours on administrative tasks. Although AI has the potential to streamline these processes, there is a lack of suitable electronic health records (EHR) datasets for benchmarking and fine-tuning medically administrative LLMs. This year researchers have made strides to address this gap by introducing MedAlign: a comprehensive EHR-based Highlighted Research: Figure 5.2.22 Figure 5.2.16 MedAlign workflow Source: Fleming et al., 2023 benchmark with 983 questions and instructions and 303 clinician responses, drawn from seven different medical specialties (Figure 5.2.22). MedAlign is the first extensive EHR-focused benchmark. The researchers then tested various existing LLMs on MedAlign. Of all LLMs, a GPT-4 variant using multistep refinement achieved the highest correctness rate (65.0%) and was routinely preferred over other LLMs (Figure 5.2.23). MedAlign is a valuable milestone toward using AI to alleviate administrative burdens in healthcare. 324 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 5 PreviewTable of Contents 5.2 AI in Medicine Chapter 5: Science and MedicineArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 MedAlign (cont’d) Highlighted Research: 48% 56% 73% 71% 82% 52% 58% 72% 74% 81% 44% 42% 67% 70% 76% 27% 28% 33% 50% 63% 29% 26% 30% 50% 64% 18% 19% 24% 37% 36%GPT-4 (32k + MR)GPT-4 (32k)GPT-4 (2k)Vicuña-13B (2k)Vicuña-7B (2k)MPT-7B-Instruct (2k) MPT-7B-Instruct (2k) Vicuña-7B (2k) Vicuña-13B (2k) GPT-4 (2k) GPT-4 (32k) GPT-4 (32k + MR) 50% 52% 66% 63% 79% 50% 51% 63% 58% 77% 48% 49% 66% 61% 79% 34% 37% 34% 49% 70% 37% 42% 39% 51% 71% 21% 23% 21% 30% 29%GPT-4 (32k + MR)GPT-4 (32k)GPT-4 (2k)Vicuña-13B (2k)Vicuña-7B (2k)MPT-7B-Instruct (2k) MPT-7B-Instruct (2k) Vicuña-7B (2k) Vicuña-13B (2k) GPT-4 (2k) GPT-4 (32k) GPT-4 (32k + MR) Model B (loser) Model B (loser)Model A (winner)Model A (winner) Human ranks COMET ranks Evaluation of model performance: human vs. COMET ranks Source: Fleming et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 5.2.23 CHAPTER 6: Education Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Overview 327 Chapter Highlights 328 6.1 Postsecondary CS and AI Education 329 United States and Canada 329 CS Bachelor’s Graduates 329 CS Master’s Graduates 331 CS PhD Graduates 333 CS, CE, and Information Faculty 336 Europe 344 Informatics, CS, CE, and IT Bachelor’s Graduates 344 Informatics, CS, CE, and IT Master’s Graduates 347 Informatics, CS, CE, and IT PhD Graduates 351 AI-Related Study Programs 355 Total Courses 355 Education Level 356 Geographic Distribution 357 6.2 K–12 CS and AI Education 359 United States 359 State-Level Trends 359 AP Computer Science 361 Highlight: Access Issues 363 Highlight: ChatGPT Usage Among Teachers and Students 364 Preview ACCESS THE PUBLIC DATA 326 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 CHAPTER 6: Education Table of Contents 327 CHAPTER 6: Education Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Overview This chapter examines trends in AI and computer science (CS) education, focusing on who is learning, where they are learning, and how these trends have evolved over time. Amid growing concerns about AI’s impact on education, it also investigates the use of new AI tools like ChatGPT by teachers and students. The analysis begins with an overview of the state of postsecondary CS and AI education in the United States and Canada, based on the Computing Research Association’s annual Taulbee Survey. It then reviews data from Informatics Europe regarding CS education in Europe. This year introduces a new section with data from Studyportals on the global count of AI-related English-language study programs. The chapter wraps up with insights into K–12 CS education in the United States from Code.org and findings from the Walton Foundation survey on ChatGPT’s use in schools. Table of Contents 328 CHAPTER 6: Education Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 1. The number of American and Canadian CS bachelor’s graduates continues to rise, new CS master’s graduates stay relatively flat, and PhD graduates modestly grow. While the number of new American and Canadian bachelor’s graduates has consistently risen for more than a decade, the number of students opting for graduate education in CS has flattened. Since 2018, the number of CS master’s and PhD graduates has slightly declined. 2. The migration of AI PhDs to industry continues at an accelerating pace. In 2011, roughly equal percentages of new AI PhDs took jobs in industry (40.9%) and academia (41.6%). However, by 2022, a significantly larger proportion (70.7%) joined industry after graduation compared to those entering academia (20.0%). Over the past year alone, the share of industry-bound AI PhDs has risen by 5.3 percentage points, indicating an intensifying brain drain from universities into industry. 3. Less transition of academic talent from industry to academia. In 2019, 13% of new AI faculty in the United States and Canada were from industry. By 2021, this figure had declined to 11%, and in 2022, it further dropped to 7%. This trend indicates a progressively lower migration of high-level AI talent from industry into academia. 4. CS education in the United States and Canada becomes less international. Proportionally fewer international CS bachelor’s, master’s, and PhDs graduated in 2022 than in 2021. The drop in international students in the master’s category was especially pronounced. 5. More American high school students take CS courses, but access problems remain. In 2022, 201,000 AP CS exams were administered. Since 2007, the number of students taking these exams has increased more than tenfold. However, recent evidence indicates that students in larger high schools and those in suburban areas are more likely to have access to CS courses. 6. AI-related degree programs are on the rise internationally. The number of English-language, AI-related postsecondary degree programs has tripled since 2017, showing a steady annual increase over the past five years. Universities worldwide are offering more AI-focused degree programs. 7. The United Kingdom and Germany lead in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduate production. The United Kingdom and Germany lead Europe in producing the highest number of new informatics, CS, CE, and information bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD graduates. On a per capita basis, Finland leads in the production of both bachelor’s and PhD graduates, while Ireland leads in the production of master’s graduates.

The survey covers 297 PhD-granting CS departments across the United States and Canada. 1 6.1 Postsecondary CS and AI Education CS Bachelor’s Graduates Over the past decade, the total number of new CS bachelor’s graduates in North America has steadily risen, increasing more than threefold, with a 7.9% year-over-year rise from 2021 to 2022 (Figure 6.1.1). 1 It is important to note that not all PhD-granting departments targeted in the survey provided responses. Out of the 297 departments targeted, only 182 responded, yielding an overall response rate of 61%. This section provides an overview of postsecondary education in CS and AI, highlighting graduation statistics across North America and Europe for various degrees including bachelor’s, master’s, and PhDs. It also covers information on AI-related courses offered in English. 6.1 Postsecondary CS and AI Education Chapter 6: Education Figure 6.1.1 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 330 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 6 PreviewTable of Contents 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 0% 4% 8% 12% 16%New international CS bachelor’s graduates (% of total)15.20% New international CS bachelor’s graduates (% of total) in the United States and Canada, 2010–22 Source: CRA Taulbee Survey, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report For the first time in almost eight years, the proportion of international students among CS bachelor’s graduates in American and Canadian universities declined, falling from 16.3% in 2021 to 15.2% in 2022 (Figure 6.1.2). This decline likely reflects the increased difficulty of obtaining study visas during the early years of the Trump administration, an impact that is only now beginning to manifest in the data. The decline is also partially attributable to international travel restrictions that were imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting the ability of international students to study in the United States and Canada. Despite this recent drop, the overall trend over the last decade shows a steady increase in the proportion of international students. 6.1 Postsecondary CS and AI Education Chapter 6: Education Figure 6.1.2 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 331 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 6 PreviewTable of Contents 6,851 6,611 7,462 7,205 7,488 9,933 11,239 13,037 15,532 14,735 14,853 15,068 14,696 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 16,000Number of new CS master’s graduates New CS master’s graduates in the United States and Canada, 2010–22 Source: CRA Taulbee Survey, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report CS Master’s Graduates AI courses are commonly included in CS master’s degree programs. While the total number of new CS master’s graduates from American and Canadian universities more than doubled over the past decade, the number appears to have leveled out since 2018 and slightly decreased, by 2.5%, last year (Figure 6.1.3). This leveling is a reflection of the decline in international master’s students shown in the following graph. 6.1 Postsecondary CS and AI Education Chapter 6: Education Figure 6.1.3 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 332 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 6 PreviewTable of Contents 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 0% 20% 40% 60% 80%New international CS master’s graduates (% of total) 50.40% New international CS master’s graduates (% of total) in the United States and Canada, 2010–22 Source: CRA Taulbee Survey, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report In 2022, American and Canadian universities experienced a notable decrease in international CS master’s students.

In 2011, 37% of failed searches were due to no offer being made, while 34% were because the offer made was declined (Figure 6.1.13). In contrast, in 2022, only 15% ended with no offer being made, while 55% involved offers that were turned down. This trend appears to reflect an increasingly competitive market for new CS faculty. However, it remains unclear whether this indicates heightened competition with other academic positions or with industry positions. 6.1 Postsecondary CS and AI Education Chapter 6: EducationArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 15% 14% 8% 13% 14% 14% 16% 26% 26% 37% 37% 37% 55% 53% 44% 56% 51% 52% 43% 40% 36% 55% 45% 34% 6% 12% 6% 5% 10% 10% 17% 23% 22% 18% 23% 27% 28% 31% 26% 25% 10% 18% 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Didn’t �nd a person who met our hiring goals O�ers turned down Technically vacant, not �lled for admin reasons Hiring in progress OtherReason faculty positions remained un�lled (% of total) Reason why new CS, CE, and information faculty positions remained unlled (% of total), 2011–22 Source: CRA Taulbee Survey, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 6.1.13 341 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 6 PreviewTable of Contents In 2022, North American departments in CS, CE, and information disciplines experienced a significant increase in faculty departures, totaling 405, compared to 303 in 2021 (Figure 6.1.14).

Most countries in the sample saw an increase in graduates in these fields compared to a decade ago, though there were exceptions like Poland, Spain, and the Czech Republic (Figure 6.1.18). 3 There is no singular term for CS education that is used uniformly across European countries. Across Europe, CS education can be reflected in terms such as informatics, computer science (CS), computer engineering (CE), computing, information technology (IT), information and communication technology (ICT), and information science and technology (IST). The full list of subject names (and English translations) that Informatics Europe uses to identify informatics studies programs can be found at the following link. 4 Readers are cautioned against making per capita comparisons between the CRA North American data and the European CS graduate data detailed in subsequent sections, as the European data is collected from national statistical offices and boasts broader coverage. 5 Note that not all countries for which the AI Index has data are visualized in the figures in this section. To access the complete data, please view the public data associated with this chapter. Moreover, the year label refers to the year in which an academic year ends. For example, the figures visualizing new graduates for 2022 reflect the number of graduates reported for the 2021/2022 academic year. For the sake of visual simplicity, the Index opts to focus on the year in which students graduated. 6.1 Postsecondary CS and AI Education Chapter 6: Education Figure 6.1.17 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 345 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 6 PreviewTable of Contents -21% -15% -14% 23% 28% 39% 48% 59% 66% 70% 72% 88% 117% 118% 153% −20% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120% 140% 160% Czech Republic Poland Spain Finland Germany United Kingdom Italy Austria Ireland Romania Portugal Netherlands Switzerland Turkey Norway % change of new informatics, CS, CE, and IT bachelor’s graduates Source: Informatics Europe, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Percentage change of new informatics, CS, CE, and IT bachelor’s graduates by country in Europe, 2012 vs. 2022 6.1 Postsecondary CS and AI Education Chapter 6: Education Figure 6.1.18 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Finland (53.4), Norway (42.6), and the Netherlands (38.6) lead in the number of new bachelor’s graduates in informatics CS, CE, and IT per 100,000 inhabitants (Figure 6.1.19).

Figure 7.2.2 illustrates the annual count of AI-related bills passed since 2016. While the total dropped to 28 in 2023 from 39 in the previous year, the number of AI-related bills passed in 2023 significantly exceeds the total passed in 2016. Figure 7.2.1 2 The analysis of passed AI policies may undercount the number of actual bills, given that large bills can include multiple sub-bills related to AI; for example, the CHIPS and Science Act passed by the United States in 2022. 3 The AI Index monitored AI-related bills passed in Hong Kong and Macao, despite these not being officially recognized countries. Thus, the Index covers a total of 130 geographic areas. Laws passed by Hong Kong and Macao were counted in the overall tally of AI-related bills. This year, the Index expanded its country sample compared to previous years, resulting in a difference between the number of AI-related bills reported this year and those in prior reports. 37 7 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 7 PreviewTable of Contents 7.2 AI and Policymaking Chapter 7: Policy and GovernanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40Number of AI-related bills28 Number of AI-related bills passed into law in 128 select countries, 2016–23 Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 7.2.2 378 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 7 PreviewTable of Contents 7.2 AI and Policymaking Chapter 7: Policy and GovernanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 7.2.3 Figure 7.2.4 5 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 United States Russia Luxembourg Kazakhstan Italy Hungary Austria Andorra Spain Portugal Argentina United Kingdom South Korea France Belgium Number of AI-related bills Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Number of AI-related bills passed into law in select countries, 2023 23 15 12 11 11 10 10 8 7 6 5 3 3 3 3 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 Germany Andorra Argentina Slovenia Philippines Austria France United Kingdom Russia Italy South Korea Spain Belgium Portugal United States Number of AI-related bills Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Number of AI-related bills passed into law in select countries, 2016–23 (sum) By Geographic Area Figure 7.2.3 highlights the number of laws containing mentions of AI that were enacted in 2023.

A bill deemed to have high relevance to AI is fundamentally focused on AI-related policy, like the AI Training Act passed in 2022, which mandates AI training programs for executive agency workers. Conversely, bills with medium relevance incorporate significant AI policy elements but are not fundamentally focused on AI-related matters. For example, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 includes sections on AI performance metrics and AI capabilities development for the Department of Defense. However, because it has a broader focus, namely authorizing various Defense Agency programs, and is not completely centered on AI, it was assigned a medium AI relevance. Low relevance AI bills merely mention AI in passing without a substantial legislative focus on AI. An example of a low relevance AI bill is the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. This bill allocates funding to various federal agencies, and mentions AI primarily in the context of encouraging these agencies to consider workforce training opportunities for sectors like cybersecurity, energy, and AI. Figure 7.2.5 illustrates the distribution of AI-related bills passed into law globally in 2023, categorized by their relevance to AI. Out of 28 AI-related bills enacted, two were classified as having high relevance to AI, while 18 were deemed to have medium relevance. 380 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 7 PreviewTable of Contents 3 7 8 16 12 17 13 5 6 7 8 1 3 8 9 21 18 24 21 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 5 10 15 20 25 Expansive RestrictiveNumber of AI-related bills Number of AI-related bills passed into law in select countries by approach, 2016–23 Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 7.2 AI and Policymaking Chapter 7: Policy and GovernanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 7.2.6 By Approach The AI Index also categorized AI-related bills as either expansive or restrictive. Expansive bills aim to enhance a nation’s AI capabilities, such as establishing a network of publicly accessible supercomputers. Restrictive bills, on the other hand, impose limitations on AI usage, like setting rules for deploying facial recognition technology. A bill can be both, or neither. 4 Distinguishing between expansive or restrictive bills can highlight legislator priorities: whether policymakers focus on expanding AI capabilities, imposing restrictions, or balancing both. Figure 7.2.6 indicates a global trend toward regulating AI usage, showing that, while the commitment to enhancing AI capabilities remains, there is a growing shift toward restrictive legislation. This change suggests that legislators are increasingly focused on mitigating the potential harms of AI’s integration into society. 4 The AI Index only categorized bills as being expansive or restrictive if they were identified as having medium or high AI relevance. Consequently, the totals depicted in Figure 7.2.5 may not fully correspond with those presented earlier in the chapter. 381 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 7 PreviewTable of Contents 0 1 2 1 0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 3 8 6 7 5 0 0 0 0 3 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 3 4 2 1 0 2 1 4 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Transportation and public works Taxation Science, technology, communications Labor and employment Health Government operations and politics Foreign trade and international nance Finance and nancial sector Environmental protection Energy Education Economics and public nance Crime and law enforcement Commerce Civil rights and liberties, minority issues Arts, culture, religion Armed forces and national securityPrimary subject matter Number of AI-related bills passed into law in select countries by primary subject matter, 2016–23 Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 7.2 AI and Policymaking Chapter 7: Policy and GovernanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Figure 7.2.7 By Subject Matter The AI Index’s global analysis of AI legislation classifies bills by their primary subject matter according to the typology used by the U.S. Congress to classify American legislation. 5 Historically, economics and public finance have been the predominant focus of AI-related legislation, reflecting the fact that AI-related policymaking matters are often incorporated within budgetary bills related to public appropriations (Figure 7.2.7). However, in 2023 the distribution of primary topics among passed bills broadened significantly, encompassing a diverse range of policy areas. Specifically, two bills were passed in each of the following categories: armed forces and national security; civil rights and liberties, minority issues; commerce; education; labor and employment; science, technology, and communication. This diversity indicates that AI policy concerns are increasingly spanning various sectors. 5 Similar to the classification of bills as either expansive or restrictive, only bills coded as having a medium or high relevance to AI were coded for their primary subject matter. Consequently, not all AI-related bills featured in this section’s analysis have subject matter coding available. 382 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 7 PreviewTable of Contents 7.2 AI and Policymaking Chapter 7: Policy and GovernanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180Number of AI-related bills 1, Passed 181, Proposed Number of AI-related bills in the United States, 2016–23 (proposed vs. passed) Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report U.S. Legislative Records Federal Level Figure 7.2.8 illustrates the total number of passed versus proposed AI-related bills in the U.S. Congress, highlighting a significant increase in proposed legislation.

This section examines AI regulations within the United States and the European Union. Unlike legislation, which establishes legal frameworks within nations, regulations are detailed directives crafted by executive authorities to enforce legislation. In the United States, prominent regulatory agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Since the specifics of legislation often manifest through regulatory actions, understanding the AI regulatory landscape is essential in order to develop a deeper understanding of AI policymaking. 7.4 AI Regulation 7.4 AI Regulation Chapter 7: Policy and GovernanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 8 A full description of the project’s methodology can be found in the Appendix. 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 5 10 15 20 25Number of AI-related regulations 25 Number of AI-related regulations in the United States, 2016–23 Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report U.S. Regulation This section examines AI-related regulations enacted by American regulatory agencies between 2016 and 2023. It provides an analysis of the total number of regulations, as well as their topics, scope, regulatory intent, and originating agencies. To compile this data, the AI Index team performed a keyword search for “artificial intelligence” on the Federal Register, a comprehensive repository of government documents from nearly all branches of the American government, encompassing more than 436 agencies. 8 Overview The number of AI-related regulations has risen significantly, both in the past year and over the last five years (Figure 7.4.1). In 2023, there were 25 AI-related regulations, a stark increase from just one in 2016. Last year alone, the total number of AI-related regulations grew by 56.3%.

A medium relevance regulation includes meaningful mentions of AI but is not solely centered on it. A low relevance regulation mentions AI in passing, without a significant focus on AI-related matters. By Relevance The AI Index categorized AI-related regulations— those mentioning AI—into three levels of relevance: low, medium, and high. 9 In 2023, the number of high and medium relevance AI-related regulations increased compared to 2022. For instance, a high relevance AI regulation was the Copyright Office and Library of Congress’ Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence. This policy statement clarified registration practices for works incorporating AI- generated material. Meanwhile, a medium-relevance example is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Cybersecurity Risk Management Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, which established standardized disclosure practices for public companies concerning cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incidents. Figure 7.4.2 categorizes AI-related regulations in the United States based on their relevance to AI. A growing proportion of these regulations is highly relevant to AI. Among the 25 AI-related regulations enacted in 2023, four were identified as being highly relevant, the greatest amount since tracking began in 2016. 395 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 7 PreviewTable of Contents 7.4 AI Regulation Chapter 7: Policy and GovernanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 10 Regulations can originate from multiple agencies, so the annual totals in Figure 7.4.3 may exceed those in Figure 7.4.1. 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 NaN 1 2 4 5 4 3 0 NaN 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 NaN 0 0 1 1 3 5 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 NaN 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 NaN 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 NaN 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 NaN 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 NaN 2 6 5 2 3 5 0 NaN 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 NaN 0 0 1 1 2 1 0 NaN 1 2 5 5 5 4 1 NaN 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 NaN 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 NaN 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 NaN 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 NaN 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 NaN 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 NaN 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 NaN 0 0 1 3 1 1 0 NaN 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 NaN 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 NaN 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 NaN 0 0 1 0 1 0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Treasury Department Transportation Department Securities and Exchange Commission Public Health Service Patent and Trademark O�ce O�ce of the Secretary O�ce of the Inspector General O�ce of Inspector General Occupational Safety and Health Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission National Science Foundation National Credit Union Administration Library of Congress Labor Department Investment Security O�ce Industry and Security Bureau Housing and Urban Development Department Homeland Security Department Health and Human Services Department Food and Drug Administration Federal Railroad Administration Federal Communications Commission Executive O�ce of the President Energy Department Employment and Training Administration Employee Bene�ts Security Administration Education Department Copyright O�ce, Library of Congress Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Comptroller of the Currency Commerce Department Children and Families Administration Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Census BureauAgency Number of AI-related regulations in the United States by agency, 2016–23 Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report By Agency10 Which agencies are the primary sources of AI regulations? In 2023, the Executive Office of the President and the Commerce Department led with five AI-related regulations each, followed by the Health and Human Services Department and the Industry and Security Bureau, with each issuing four (Figure 7.4.3). Furthermore, the number of agencies issuing AI regulations increased from 17 in 2022 to 21 in 2023, indicating a growing need for clarity and concern regarding AI among a broader array of American regulatory bodies. Figure 7.4.3 396 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 7 PreviewTable of Contents 7.4 AI Regulation Chapter 7: Policy and GovernanceArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 11 Expansive regulations refer to actions by regulatory agencies or governments aimed at augmenting AI capacity, including investments in supercomputing infrastructure. Restrictive regulations involve steps to curtail AI capabilities, such as imposing restrictions on the use of facial recognition algorithms. Restrictive AI regulations may also be intended to address underlying policy concerns, such as AI’s potential impact on citizens’ civil liberties. According to this coding typology, a regulation can be classified as both expansive and restrictive, or it may fit neither category. The AI Index assigned the labels “expansive” or “restrictive” only to regulations deemed to have medium to high relevance to AI. Therefore the regulation totals in Figure 7.4.4 are less than those reported earlier in the section. 2 4 2 2 3 4 10 1 1 3 5 3 6 13 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Expansive RestrictiveNumber of AI-related regulations Number of AI-related regulations in the United States by approach, 2016–23 Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report By Approach The AI Index categorized regulations based on their approach: whether they expanded or restricted AI capabilities. 11 Over time, the trend in AI regulations in the United States has shifted significantly toward restriction (Figure 7.4.4). In 2023, there were 10 restrictive AI regulations compared to just three that were expansive. Conversely in 2020, there were four regulations that were expansive and one that was restrictive.

To compile this data, the Index team conducted a keyword search for “artificial intelligence” on EUR-Lex, a comprehensive database of EU legislation, regulations, and case law. EUR- Lex provides access to a wide range of regulatory documents, such as legal acts, consolidated texts, international agreements, preparatory documents, and legislative procedures. The analysis in this section focused exclusively on documents with binding regulatory authority. The search for AI-related regulation in the European Union was limited to legal acts, international agreements, and consolidated texts. The same methodological approach was used to code EU regulations, as was used to code U.S. regulations. 13 Overview The number of AI-related regulations passed by the European Union increased from 22 in 2022 to 32 in 2023 (Figure 7.4.6). Despite this increase, the number of AI-related regulations passed by the European Union peaked in 2021 with 46.

Regulations concerning government operations and politics involve setting rules for how governments and associated governmental processes operate. One such regulation was the Commission Recommendation (EU) on inclusive and resilient electoral processes in the Union and enhancing the European nature and efficient conduct of the elections to the European Parliament. This regulation acknowledged that AI could be used to generate political misinformation and outlined steps the Commission has taken to ensure AI does not challenge the legitimacy of elections. Evidently, European Union legislators are considering how AI will impact their government’s work.

These reports, however, do not include information on classified AI R&D investment. According to the 2023 report, in the fiscal year 2023, U.S. government agencies allocated a total of $1.8 billion to AI research and development spending (Figure 7.5.1). The funding for AI R&D has risen annually since FY 2018, more than tripling since then. For FY 2024, a larger budget of $1.9 billion has been requested. 15 Figure 7.5.1 Figure 7.5.2 details the breakdown of NITRD AI R&D budget requests by agency. For FY 2024, the National Science Foundation (NSF) had the highest request at $531 million, followed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) at $322.1 million, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at $284.5 million. 404 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 7 PreviewTable of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 7.5 U.S. Public Investment in AI Chapter 7: Policy and Governance 412.00 429.80 400.50 322.10FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 37.70 41.40 38.60 34.30FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 107.50 227.50 241.30 274.00FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 180.80 164.40 169.90 169.90FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 8.00 8.80 13.70 34.20FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 12.40 6.40 8.80 10.30FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 10.00 0.00 0.00 0.00FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 46.40 32.40 39.80 35.80FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 0.00 0.00 0.50 0.10FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 2.90 2.90 4.00 4.00FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 178.20 268.80 288.20 284.50FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 9.10 5.80 8.00 8.00FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 3.80 9.50 8.40 8.40FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 25.90 26.00 31.00 31.00FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 1.20 0.00 0.00 0.00FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 395.90 506.50 418.40 531.30FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 1.20 0.00 0.00 0.00FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 0.00 0.40 0.30 0.30FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 145.20 93.20 95.20 104.20FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 0.00 15.00 21.00 20.00FY 2021(enacted)FY 2022(enacted)FY 2023(enacted)FY 2024(requested)0 200 400 600 DARPA DHS DOD DOE DOI DOT ED-IES FDA NARA NASA NIH NIJ NIOSH NIST NOAA NSF NTIA TREAS USDA VA US governmental agency NITRD budgets for AI, FY 2021–24 Source: U.S. NITRD Program | Chart: 2024 AI Index reportBudget (in millions of U.S. dollars) Figure 7.5.2 405 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 7 PreviewTable of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 0.93 0.84 0.87 1.10 1.80 Sum of FY20 funding Sum of FY21 funding Sum of FY22 funding Sum of FY23 funding Sum of FY24 funding 0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 1.20 1.40 1.60 1.80Budget request (in billions of U.S. dollars) US DoD budget request for AI-specic research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E), FY 2020–24 Source: U.S. Oce of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report U.S. Department of Defense Budget Requests Every year the DoD releases the amount of funding they request for nonclassified AI-specific research, development, test, and evaluation.

Such contracts typically occupy the largest share of an agency’s budget. Data in this section comes from Govini, which created a taxonomy of spending by the U.S. government on critical technologies including AI. Govini applied supervised machine learning and natural language processing to parse, analyze, and categorize large volumes of federal contracts data, including prime contracts, grants, and other transaction authority (OTA) awards. The use of AI models enables Govini to analyze data that is otherwise often inaccessible. AI Contract Spending Figure 7.5.4 highlights total U.S. government spending on AI, subdivided by various AI segments. From 2022 to 2023, total AI spending increased marginally from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. 16 Since 2018, total spending has increased nearly 2.4 times. In 2023, the AI subsegments that saw the greatest amount of government spending included machine learning ($1.5 billion) and computer vision ($1.0 billion). Figure 7.5.4 16 In 2023, Govini made minor adjustments to their classification methodology. Consequently, the contract totals presented in Figure 7.5.4 may vary slightly from those reported in earlier editions of the AI Index. 7.5 U.S. Public Investment in AI Chapter 7: Policy and Governance 407 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 7 PreviewTable of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 0.18 1.24 0.89 0.88 0.23 (+28%) 0.55 (-56%) 1.04 (+17%) 1.51 (+72%) 0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 1.20 1.40 1.60 Natural language processing Autonomy Computer vision Machine learning 2023 2022 U.S. government spending (in billions of U.S. dollars) US government spending in AI/ML and autonomy by segment, FY 2022 vs. 2023 Source: Govini, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 7.5.5 shows U.S. government spending by AI segment in FY 2022 and FY 2023.

For instance, a considerable number of prominent AI companies and the datasets utilized for model training originate from Western nations, thereby reflecting Western perspectives. The lack of diversity can perpetuate or even exacerbate societal inequalities and biases. This chapter delves into diversity trends in AI. The chapter begins by drawing on data from the Computing Research Association (CRA) to provide insights into the state of diversity in American and Canadian computer science (CS) departments. A notable addition to this year’s analysis is data sourced from Informatics Europe, which sheds light on diversity trends within European CS education. Next, the chapter examines participation rates at the Women in Machine Learning (WiML) workshop held annually at NeurIPS. Finally, the chapter analyzes data from Code.org, offering insights into the current state of diversity in secondary CS education across the United States. The AI Index is dedicated to enhancing the coverage of data shared in this chapter. Demographic data regarding AI trends, particularly in areas such as sexual orientation, remains scarce. The AI Index urges other stakeholders in the AI domain to intensify their endeavors to track diversity trends associated with AI and hopes to comprehensively cover such trends in future reports. Overview CHAPTER 8: Diversity Table of Contents CHAPTER 8: Diversity 414 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 1. U.S. and Canadian bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD CS students continue to grow more ethnically diverse. While white students continue to be the most represented ethnicity among new resident graduates at all three levels, the representation from other ethnic groups, such as Asian, Hispanic, and Black or African American students, continues to grow. For instance, since 2011, the proportion of Asian CS bachelor’s degree graduates has increased by 19.8 percentage points, and the proportion of Hispanic CS bachelor’s degree graduates has grown by 5.2 percentage points. 2. Substantial gender gaps persist in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduates at all educational levels. Every surveyed European country reported more male than female graduates in bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD programs for informatics, CS, CE, and IT. While the gender gaps have narrowed in most countries over the last decade, the rate of this narrowing has been slow. 3. U.S. K–12 CS education is growing more diverse, reflecting changes in both gender and ethnic representation. The proportion of AP CS exams taken by female students rose from 16.8% in 2007 to 30.5% in 2022. Similarly, the participation of Asian, Hispanic/Latino/Latina, and Black/African American students in AP CS has consistently increased year over year.

As a proportion of ethnicities among all CS bachelor’s graduates, Asians have risen the fastest, doubling in the last 10 years (Figure 8.1.3). 8.1 AI Postsecondary Education CS Bachelor’s Graduates The percentage of female CS bachelor’s graduates reached 22.2% in 2022, continuing a decade-long rise (Figure 8.1.1). Nonbinary/other-identifying CS bachelor’s graduates accounted for 0.1% in 2022. 1 The charts in this section look only at the ethnicity of domestic or native CS students and faculty. Although the CRA reports data on the proportion of nonresident aliens at each educational level (i.e., bachelor’s, master’s, PhD, and faculty), data on the ethnicity of nonresident aliens is not included. 2 Not all PhD-granting departments targeted in the survey provided responses. Of the 297 departments targeted, only 182 responded, resulting in an overall response rate of 61%. The AI Index advises against making per capita comparisons between the CRA North American data and the data on European CS graduates detailed in the subsequent sections due to the European data being collected from national statistical offices, which affords it broader coverage. This section examines trends in diversity within CS and AI postsecondary education across North America and Europe. 8.1 AI Postsecondary Education Chapter 8: Diversity Figure 8.1.1 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 416 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 8 PreviewTable of Contents 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000Number of new CS bachelor’s graduates 28, Native Hawaiian or Pacic Islander 33, American Indian or Alaska Native 1,004, Black or African American 1,072, Multiracial (not Hispanic) 2,708, Hispanic (any race) 8,795, Asian 10,970, White Ethnicity of new resident CS bachelor’s graduates in the United States and Canada, 2011–22 Source: CRA Taulbee Survey, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%New CS bachelor’s graduates (% of total) 0.11%, Native Hawaiian or Pacic Islander 0.13%, American Indian or Alaska Native 4.08%, Black or African American 4.36%, Multiracial (not Hispanic) 11.00%, Hispanic (any race) 35.74%, Asian 44.58%, White Ethnicity of new resident CS bachelor’s graduates (% of total) in the United States and Canada, 2011–22 Source: CRA Taulbee Survey, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 8.1 AI Postsecondary Education Chapter 8: Diversity Figure 8.1.2 Figure 8.1.3 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 417 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 8 PreviewTable of Contents 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%New CS master’s graduates (% of total) 0.08%, Nonbinary/Other 26.26%, Female 73.65%, Male Gender of new CS master’s graduates (% of total) in the United States and Canada, 2011–22 Source: CRA Taulbee Survey, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report CS Master’s Graduates The proportion of female CS master’s graduates has seen minimal growth in the last decade, increasing to 26.3% in 2022 from 24.6% in 2011.

Despite some narrowing since 2011, men continue to dominate. For example, France (14.8%), the United Kingdom (17.8%), and Germany (21.5%) show relatively low proportions of female graduates in these fields (Figure 8.1.15). Bulgaria stands out among the surveyed countries with the highest proportion of female graduates (35.2%). Informatics, CS, CE, and IT Master’s Graduates Similar gender disparities are observed among European informatics, CS, CE, and IT master’s graduates, with a significantly greater proportion of males than females in most surveyed countries. As of 2022, Estonia (42.0%), Romania (41.9%), and Bulgaria (40.4%) reported the greatest proportion of female master’s graduates (Figure 8.1.16). In contrast, Belgium (13.7%), Italy (14.1%), and Switzerland (15.8%) reported the smallest proportion of female master’s graduates. Informatics, CS, CE, and IT PhD Graduates In all surveyed European countries, informatics, CS, CE, and IT PhD graduates are predominantly male. However, in nations such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland, the gender gap has narrowed over the last decade, with women constituting a growing share of PhD graduates (Figure 8.1.17). 4 In contrast, countries like Finland and Spain have seen the gap slightly widen. 3 The year label refers to the year in which an academic year ends. For example, the figures visualizing new graduates for 2022 reflect the number of graduates reported for the 2021/2022 academic year. For the sake of visual simplicity, the Index opts to focus on the year in which students graduated. 4 In countries where the number of PhD graduates is relatively small, trends in gender proportions can be prone to sudden year-over-year changes. For example, in 2022 Bulgaria produced 24 total PhDs, Latvia 12, and Estonia 26. 8.1 AI Postsecondary Education Chapter 8: DiversityArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 426 Artificial

Understanding this public opinion is vital in better anticipating AI’s societal impacts and how the integration of the technology may differ across countries and demographic groups. This chapter examines public opinion on AI through global, national, demographic, and ethnic perspectives. It draws upon several data sources: longitudinal survey data from Ipsos profiling global AI attitudes over time, survey data from the University of Toronto exploring public perception of ChatGPT, and data from Pew examining American attitudes regarding AI. The chapter concludes by analyzing mentions of significant AI models on Twitter, using data from Quid. CHAPTER 9: Public Opinion 438 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 1. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous. A survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness toward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests that 52% of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 38% in 2022. 2. AI sentiment in Western nations continues to be low, but is slowly improving. In 2022, several developed Western nations, including Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the United States, were among the least positive about AI products and services. Since then, each of these countries has seen a rise in the proportion of respondents acknowledging the benefits of AI, with the Netherlands experiencing the most significant shift. 3. The public is pessimistic about AI’s economic impact. In an Ipsos survey, only 37% of respondents feel AI will improve their job. Only 34% anticipate AI will boost the economy, and 32% believe it will enhance the job market. 4. Demographic differences emerge regarding AI optimism. Significant demographic differences exist in perceptions of AI’s potential to enhance livelihoods, with younger generations generally more optimistic. For instance, 59% of Gen Z respondents believe AI will improve entertainment options, versus only 40% of baby boomers. Additionally, individuals with higher incomes and education levels are more optimistic about AI’s positive impacts on entertainment, health, and the economy than their lower-income and less-educated counterparts. 5. ChatGPT is widely known and widely used. An international survey from the University of Toronto suggests that 63% of respondents are aware of ChatGPT. Of those aware, around half report using ChatGPT at least once weekly.

These surveys reveal that public perceptions of AI vary widely across countries and demographic groups. AI Products and Services In 2023, Ipsos ran a survey on global attitudes toward AI products and services. The survey consisted of interviews with 22,816 adults ages 16 to 74 in 31 countries. 1 Figure 9.1.1 shows the percentage of respondents who agree with specific statements. A significant 66% anticipate AI will greatly change their lives in the 9.1 Survey Data near future, while 54% believe AI’s benefits surpass its drawbacks. About half of the respondents trust AI companies’ data-protection capabilities. The figure also contrasts Ipsos survey responses from 2022 and 2023, highlighting a shift in public AI sentiment following the release of ChatGPT—a milestone in public AI recognition. Over the last year, there has been a noticeable 6 percentage point increase in those who think AI will dramatically affect their lives in the next three to five years. Moreover, 52% now express nervousness toward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. The public across the globe is becoming increasingly cognizant of and nervous about AI’s growing impact. 1 See Appendix for more details about the survey methodology. The survey was conducted from May to June 2023. 9.1 Survey Data Chapter 9: Public Opinion Figure 9.1.1 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 440 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents Perceptions of AI’s benefits versus drawbacks vary considerably by country, according to the Ipsos survey. 78% of Indonesian, 74% of Thai, and 73% of Mexican respondents view AI products and services as more beneficial than harmful (Figure 9.1.2). In contrast, only 37% of Americans agree with this perspective. Among the 31 countries surveyed, the United States and France exhibited the most skepticism. Attitudes toward AI are becoming more positive in countries that were previously critical. In 2022, several developed Western nations, including Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the United States, were among the least positive about AI products and services. Since then, each of these countries has seen a rise in the proportion of respondents acknowledging the benefits of AI, with the Netherlands experiencing the most significant shift. By 2023, 43% of Dutch respondents viewed AI products and services positively, up from 33% the previous year. 9.1 Survey Data Chapter 9: Public OpinionArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 441 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents 78% 74% 73% 69% 67% 67% 66% 65% 65% 64% 64% 61% 59% 59% 57% 55% 52% 50% 48% 47% 46% 44% 43% 42% 40% 40% 39% 39% 38% 37% 37% 71% 70% 65% 65% 64% 63% 62% 60% 57% 57% 55% 53% 50% 49% 48% 42% 40% 38% 38% 37% 37% 35% 33% 32% 31% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% France United States Canada Belgium Sweden Australia Ireland Germany Netherlands New Zealand Great Britain Poland Hungary Spain Japan Italy Argentina Chile South Africa Romania Brazil Singapore Colombia India South Korea Turkey Peru Malaysia Mexico Thailand Indonesia 2023 2022 % of respondents that “Agree” ‘Products and services using AI have more benets than drawbacks,’ by country (% of total), 2022 vs. 2023 Source: Ipsos, 2022–23 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 78% 74% 73% 69% 67% 67% 66% 65% 65% 64% 64% 61% 59% 59% 57% 55% 52% 50% 48% 47% 46% 44% 43% 42% 40% 40% 39% 39% 38% 37% 37% 71% 70% 65% 65% 64% 63% 62% 60% 57% 57% 55% 53% 50% 49% 48% 42% 40% 38% 38% 37% 37% 35% 33% 32% 31% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% France United States Canada Belgium Sweden Australia Ireland Germany Netherlands New Zealand Great Britain Poland Hungary Spain Japan Italy Argentina Chile South Africa Romania Brazil Singapore Colombia India South Korea Turkey Peru Malaysia Mexico Thailand Indonesia 2023 2022 % of respondents that “Agree” ‘Products and services using AI have more benets than drawbacks,’ by country (% of total), 2022 vs. 2023 Source: Ipsos, 2022–23 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 9.1 Survey Data Chapter 9: Public Opinion Figure 9.1.2 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 442 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents 67% 59% 56% 74% 59% 70% 73% 58% 61% 64% 73% 64% 84% 58% 53% 43% 65% 75% 71% 62% 73% 69% 77% 67% 78% 76% 66% 67% 78% 73% 67% 64% 62% 52% 70% 54% 71% 67% 51% 56% 58% 62% 65% 79% 53% 63% 65% 78% 71% 63% 61% 76% 59% 73% 78% 70% 82% 61% 55% 79% 81% 57% 61% 44% 41% 66% 44% 60% 61% 37% 47% 47% 66% 66% 76% 41% 59% 43% 68% 72% 42% 45% 72% 59% 63% 63% 65% 55% 51% 33% 83% 63% 38% 57% 40% 39% 64% 38% 59% 65% 37% 42% 46% 48% 65% 78% 40% 55% 52% 69% 73% 43% 44% 67% 47% 61% 64% 59% 66% 50% 39% 74% 67% 37% 46% 40% 35% 66% 37% 51% 62% 36% 43% 42% 45% 66% 75% 38% 50% 51% 74% 74% 42% 43% 72% 50% 62% 65% 59% 76% 50% 32% 80% 74% 36% 52% 42% 39% 60% 39% 51% 56% 37% 45% 45% 46% 67% 69% 39% 53% 44% 70% 66% 44% 43% 60% 50% 62% 57% 55% 55% 49% 42% 73% 65% 36% 46% 69% 50% 51% 63% 54% 45% 52% 46% 65% 46% 58% 48% 62% 50% 23% 55% 48% 50% 63% 47% 38% 50% 53% 53% 44% 51% 53% 57% 54% 63% 44% 38% 35% 62% 38% 58% 53% 37% 39% 43% 37% 62% 76% 36% 50% 38% 68% 61% 42% 35% 65% 46% 62% 57% 60% 68% 46% 36% 73% 71% 35% 45% 38% 41% 56% 34% 44% 53% 32% 44% 42% 60% 64% 68% 38% 59% 32% 61% 66% 47% 42% 60% 55% 61% 54% 58% 40% 49% 39% 72% 57% 32% 45% 40% 31% 63% 34% 54% 54% 32% 33% 34% 36% 63% 72% 31% 44% 36% 71% 66% 36% 35% 65% 46% 54% 64% 57% 73% 41% 31% 72% 63% 34%ArgentinaAustraliaBelgiumBrazilCanadaChileColombiaFranceGermanyGreat BritainHungaryIndiaIndonesiaIrelandItalyJapanMalaysiaMexicoNetherlandsNew ZealandPeruPolandRomaniaSingaporeSouth AfricaSouth KoreaSpainSweden ThailandTurkeyUnited States Products and services using articial intelligence have profoundly changed my daily life in the past 3–5 years I trust that companies that use articial intelligence will protect my personal data I know which types of products and services use articial intelligence Products and services using articial intelligence make me nervous I trust companies that use articial intelligence as much as I trust other companies Products and services using articial intelligence make me excited Products and services using articial intelligence have more benets than drawbacks I trust articial intelligence to not discriminate or show bias towards any group of people Products and services using articial intelligence will profoundly change my daily life in the next 3–5 years I have a good understanding of what articial intelligence is Opinions about AI by country (% agreeing with statement), 2023 Source: Ipsos, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Figure 9.1.3 shows responses to Ipsos’ survey on AI products and services by country.

Figure 9.1.4 highlights the year-over- year percentage point change in answers to particular AI-related questions. For every country surveyed in both 2022 and 2023, an increase was reported in the degree to which AI products make people nervous. The sharpest increases were reported in Italy (24 percentage points), France (19), Chile (18), and Australia (18). Likewise, except for South Africa, all countries in the survey sample are now more inclined to believe that AI will significantly impact their lives in the next three to five years. The highest increase of 12 percentage points was reported in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, and Australia. 9.1 Survey Data Chapter 9: Public Opinion Figure 9.1.4 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 444 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents 57% 36% 8% 8% 35% 56% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% AI will replace your current job in the next 5 years AI will change how you do your current job in the next 5 years Likely Don’t know Not likely % of respondents Global opinions on the impact of AI on current jobs, 2023 Source: Ipsos, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report AI and Jobs This year’s Ipsos survey included more questions about how people perceive AI’s impact on their current jobs.

Younger generations, such as Gen Z and millennials, are more inclined to agree that AI will change how they do their jobs compared to older generations like Gen X and baby boomers. Specifically, 66% of Gen Z compared to 46% of boomer respondents agree with the statement that AI will likely affect their current jobs. Additionally, individuals with higher incomes, more education, and decision-making roles are more likely to foresee AI impacting their current employment. 9.1 Survey Data Chapter 9: Public Opinion Figure 9.1.6 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 446 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents 54% 62% 44% 39% 67% 39% 60% 65% 45% 37% 46% 54% 57% 72% 42% 48% 33% 62% 68% 55% 50% 70% 48% 51% 64% 71% 61% 48% 38% 71% 62% 46% 51% 63% 43% 37% 64% 42% 63% 64% 32% 39% 45% 41% 57% 71% 44% 45% 33% 57% 68% 50% 47% 71% 40% 46% 57% 66% 54% 51% 37% 68% 60% 40% 39% 47% 29% 28% 55% 29% 47% 50% 37% 25% 33% 28% 50% 58% 29% 37% 16% 49% 61% 30% 31% 55% 23% 43% 40% 49% 38% 33% 25% 56% 47% 32% 37% 36% 30% 21% 55% 25% 36% 41% 26% 23% 32% 24% 48% 62% 24% 32% 19% 47% 52% 25% 30% 56% 30% 30% 41% 51% 23% 27% 28% 66% 47% 28% 34% 28% 26% 18% 51% 20% 31% 40% 24% 27% 31% 25% 54% 58% 25% 29% 22% 50% 48% 27% 28% 46% 29% 34% 50% 39% 34% 25% 21% 62% 39% 23% 32% 38% 20% 18% 49% 19% 32% 38% 21% 20% 21% 24% 49% 50% 22% 30% 22% 39% 54% 23% 22% 54% 26% 33% 37% 38% 17% 23% 21% 53% 50% 21%GlobalArgentinaAustraliaBelgiumBrazilCanadaChileColombiaFranceGermanyGreat BritainHungaryIndiaIndonesiaIrelandItalyJapanMalaysiaMexicoNetherlandsNew ZealandPeruPolandRomaniaSingaporeSouth AfricaSouth KoreaSpainSweden ThailandTurkeyUnited States The job market The economy in my country My job My health My entertainment options (television/video content, movies, music, books) The amount of time it takes me to get things done Global opinions on the potential of AI improving life by country, 2023 Source: Ipsos, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report AI and Livelihood The Ipsos survey explored the impact respondents believe AI will have on various aspects of their lives, such as health and entertainment. On topics like time management and entertainment, the majority viewed AI positively (Figure 9.1.7). For instance, 54% of global respondents agree that AI will improve the efficiency of their tasks, and 51% believe AI will enhance entertainment options like TV, movies, music, and books. However, skepticism was more prominent in other areas. Only 39% feel AI will benefit their health, and 37% think it will improve their job. Only 34% anticipate AI will boost the economy, and just 32% believe it will enhance the job market. Similar to questions about AI products and services, responses showed intracountry consistency, with Japanese, Swedes, and Americans generally pessimistic about AI’s potential to improve livelihoods, whereas Brazilians, Indonesians, and Mexicans were more optimistic. 9.1 Survey Data Chapter 9: Public Opinion Figure 9.1.7 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 447 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents 55% 53% 63% 57% 52% 43% 47% 53% 61% 46% 53% 60% 56% 50% 52% 51% 59% 55% 51% 40% 47% 51% 57% 47% 51% 55% 54% 47% 42% 36% 46% 42% 37% 30% 34% 40% 43% 35% 39% 41% 41% 35% 38% 35% 46% 41% 31% 26% 33% 36% 41% 34% 35% 40% 0% 0% 37% 31% 40% 38% 31% 26% 32% 35% 38% 30% 33% 38% 37% 29% 34% 30% 39% 36% 28% 23% 31% 32% 34% 30% 32% 33% 34% 28%MaleFemaleGen ZMillennialGen XBoomerLower incomeMiddle incomeUpper incomeLower educationMedium educationHigher educationEmployedNonemployed Gender Generation Household income Education Employment status The job market The economy in my country My job My health My entertainment options (television/video content, movies, music, books) The amount of time it takes me to get things done Global opinions on the potential of AI improving life by demographic group, 2023 Source: Ipsos, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Significant demographic differences also exist in perceptions of AI’s potential to enhance livelihoods, with younger generations generally expressing greater optimism. For instance, 59% of Gen Z respondents believe AI will improve entertainment options, versus only 40% of baby boomers. Additionally, individuals with higher incomes and education levels are more optimistic about AI’s positive impacts on entertainment, health, and the economy compared to their lower-income and less-educated counterparts. In general, members of Gen Z, those in higher income brackets, and those with more education are the most optimistic about AI’s potential to improve life, while those from the boomer generation, lower income brackets, and with less education are the least optimistic. 9.1 Survey Data Chapter 9: Public Opinion Figure 9.1.8 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 448 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents Attitudes on ChatGPT Many argue that the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November 2022 was a watershed moment in familiarizing the public with AI. While AI encompasses much more than ChatGPT or LLMs, the prominence of ChatGPT as one of the most well-known AI tools makes gauging public sentiment toward it an interesting approach for better understanding broader opinions on AI. Global Public Opinion on Artificial Intelligence (GPO-AI) is a report created by the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society (SRI) in collaboration with the Policy, Elections and Representation Lab (PEARL) at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto. In October and November 2023, researchers from SRI and PEARL conducted a 21-country survey examining global attitudes toward AI. Figure 9.1.9 explores the extent of global public awareness of ChatGPT. Among global respondents, 63% claim awareness of ChatGPT.

They received 11,000 responses to their most recent 2023 survey. Figure 9.1.12 shows that over the last year, Americans have grown increasingly concerned about the use of AI in their daily lives. In 2021 and 2022, only 37% and 38% of Americans, respectively, reported feeling more concerned than excited about AI technology. By 2023, this figure had risen to 52%, indicating that a majority of Americans now feel more concerned than excited about AI technology. Pew also surveyed Americans’ opinions on whether they believed AI helped or hindered in specific contexts (Figure 9.1.13). Respondents reported that AI was more likely to be beneficial, particularly in assisting people to find products or services online, with 49% expressing this view. However, 53% of respondents indicated that AI was more likely to be detrimental than beneficial in safeguarding personal information privacy. 9.1 Survey Data Chapter 9: Public Opinion Figure 9.1.12 Figure 9.1.13 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 453 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents 60% 27% 44% 39% 17% 0% 50% 100% Some college or less College degree+ 27% 49% 24% 23% 49% 27% 0% 50% 100% 32% 59% 39% 50% 0% 50% 100% 45% 40% 15% 33% 46% 20% 0% 50% 100% Some college or less College degree+ 46% 38% 16% 32% 44% 23% 0% 50% 100% 41% 42% 16% 29% 50% 20% 0% 50% 100% 36% 36% 28% 31% 42% 26% 0% 50% 100% Some college or less College degree+ 34% 33% 33% 25% 39% 35% 0% 50% 100% Help Not sure Hurt % of respondents People nding products and services they are interested in online Police maintaining public safety People keeping their personal information private Companies making safe cars and trucks Doctors providing quality care to patients People taking care of their health People nding accurate information online Companies providing quality customer service Dierences in Americans’ view of AI’s impact by education level (% of total), 2023 Source: Pew Research, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Pew further segmented the data by education level (Figure 9.1.14). Across various use categories, Americans with higher education levels are more likely to believe in AI’s potential to help rather than harm. For instance, individuals with college or higher- level degrees are more likely to report that AI can significantly aid doctors in delivering quality care to patients and assist people in discovering products and services online that interest them. 9.1 Survey Data Chapter 9: Public Opinion Figure 9.1.14 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 454 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents 40 37 53 45 56 66 73 67 42 48 51 44 NaN 62 66 75 NaN NaN 74 72 NaN NaN 92 56 NaN NaN NaN 57 NaN NaN NaN 68 NaN NaN NaN 83 NaN NaN NaN 94 NaN NaN NaN 87 NaN NaN NaN 66 NaN NaN NaN 83 NaN NaN NaN 81 NaN NaN NaN 36 NaN NaN NaN 71 2023/Q1 2023/Q2 2023/Q3 2023/Q4 Midjourney v6 Gemini In�ection-2 Orca 2 Stable Video Di�usion Claude 2.1 GraphCast Whisper V3 GPT-4 Turbo Grok Mistral 7B DALL-E 3 PaLM 2 GPT-4 Copilot Stable Di�usion Net sentiment score of AI models by quarter, 2023 Source: Quid, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report Dominant Models Public attitudes toward AI can be assessed through both quantitative and qualitative analyses of posts made on social media. Quid analyzed social conversations surrounding AI models across various sectors from January to December 2023, examining over 7 million social media posts. Figure 9.2.1 shows the net sentiment score of various AI models released throughout the year. The net 9.2 Social Media Data sentiment score expresses the ratio of positive to negative sentiment around a given topic. A net sentiment score of +100 means that all conversation is positive; a score of -100 means that all conversation is negative. Many models released in 2023 received positive social media sentiment. Some of the models that garnered the highest degree of positive attention were GraphCast, a new AI-powered weather forecasting system from DeepMind, and Claude 2.1, one of Anthropic’s most recent LLMs. 9.2 Social Media Data Chapter 9: Public Opinion Figure 9.2.1 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 455 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents 46% 21% 24% 12% 0% 1% 1% 1% 53% 71% 62% 45% NaN% 5% 4% 2% NaN% NaN% 3% 7% NaN% NaN% 0% 2% NaN% NaN% NaN% 16% NaN% NaN% NaN% 2% NaN% NaN% NaN% 0% NaN% NaN% NaN% 0% NaN% NaN% NaN% 2% NaN% NaN% NaN% 0% NaN% NaN% NaN% 0% NaN% NaN% NaN% 0% NaN% NaN% NaN% 11% NaN% NaN% NaN% 0% 2023/Q1 2023/Q2 2023/Q3 2023/Q4 Midjourney v6 Gemini In�ection-2 Orca 2 Stable Video Di�usion Claude 2.1 GraphCast Whisper V3 GPT-4 Turbo Grok Mistral 7B DALL-E 3 PaLM 2 GPT-4 Copilot Stable Di�usion Select models’ share of AI social media attention by quarter, 2023 Source: Quid, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report 2 The figures in this section consider all AI-related social media conversation.

Despite the release of numerous new models by the fourth quarter of 2023, GPT-4 still captured 45% of social media attention. Other models that garnered significant attention included Grok, Stable Diffusion, and Gemini. 456 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 AI-Related Social Media Discussion in 2023 The following section, featuring data from Quid, profiles specific narratives surrounding the discussion of AI that occurred on social media in 2023. GPT-4 gathered most of the discussion volume in Q2 after its launch on March 14, 2023. Positive sentiment was primarily driven by its improvements, including faster processing speed, improved accuracy, and praise for its ability to enhance productivity across different types of work tasks, such as coding, corporate collaboration, and content creation. Negative sentiment primarily stemmed from complaints about occasional crashes of the ChatGPT website, along with an open letter led by Elon Musk and supported by over 1,300 artificial intelligence experts, urging AI laboratories to pause training of powerful AI systems. Moreover, there was disagreement regarding the “open letter” and the suggestion to halt AI research, particularly considering its potential to have a positive impact across multiple fields. For example, Andrew Ng posted: “1/The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea. I’m seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that’ll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.” — @AndrewYNg In Q4 2023, discussions surrounding the release of GPT-4 Turbo, launched in November, saw a significant increase. Positive sentiment centered around its innovative features and upgrades that could transform programmers’ workflows. These enhancements included longer conversation capabilities, improved contextual understanding, and multimodal ability to generate images. However, some negative feedback arose due to disappointment with the model’s knowledge cutoff in April 2023 and slower loading speeds compared to GPT-4. Some of the sample social media posts from this time included: “This is just insane… My GPT-4 coding assistant can now: - build and design a frontend - create a backend with working db - correctly hook them up - upload code to GitHub - deploy it to Vercel[.] I can now build *complete* apps with nothing more than my voice. The future is here!” — @mckaywrigley “Trying to make my LinkedIn profile more interesting if a recruiter is using a large language model like GPT-4 to send me a message. Looks like it works on the public version of my profile!” — @brdskggs “GPT-4 Turbo has knowledge of the world up to April 2023. @sama says the team is ‘just as annoyed as you, maybe more’ that the knowledge is not more updated and that @openai will work to make sure it never gets that outdated again.” — @VentureBeat Highlight: 9.2 Social Media Data Chapter 9: Public Opinion 457 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 9 PreviewTable of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 AI-Related Social Media Discussion in 2023 (cont’d) Discussions about Stable Diffusion were more prominent in the first half of 2023, but decreased toward the year’s end. More posts mentioned Stable Diffusion XL models than Stable Diffusion 2.0 (around 16 times more). Positive sentiment was mainly driven by the tool’s rapid increase in popularity, the potential benefits of AI in enhancing creativity, and the excitement surrounding technical advancements and improvements (e.g., enhanced accuracy, better understanding of various concepts, and higher resolution). On the other hand, negative sentiment revolved around concerns about legal and ethical issues related to AI-generated content, such as copyright violations, ownership of AI-created material, and the possible replacement of human artists by AI. Additionally, worries were expressed about the risks and threats linked to artificial intelligence, like its potential harmful effects, the spread of misinformation, and the possibility of AI being used for academic cheating. “Very happy about sharing smashed Stable Diffusion models! - In one line of code, we compressed popular text-to-image Stable Diffusion models for A100. - Evaluations across various metrics show significant speedup improvements, energy savings, and CO2 emissions savings. Now looking forward [to] sharing more compression results :) Feel free to contact us to achieve the same on your own models https://pruna.ai/contact ;)” — @Bertrand_Charp “Stable Diffusion XL with ControlNet is insane Discover the future of AI with Stability AI’s latest innovation: Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) 1.0! This powerful text-to-image generation model improves image quality and makes it easier for users to create highly detailed images. Built on a massive 3.5 billion-parameter base model, SDXL 1.0 boasts better accuracy and understanding of various concepts. Want to know more? Check out my video where I delve deeper into this groundbreaking technology!” — @work.with.ai Both Gemini (from Google) and Grok (from xAI) saw an increase in conversations during Q4 due to their late year launches. Positive feedback for Gemini focused on its improved accuracy and multilingual capabilities, as well as its potential to enhance various Google services like Search and Ads. On the other hand, negative opinions stemmed from concerns about inaccurate results, disappointment over Gemini’s delayed release, and skepticism toward the Gemini AI demo. “WHAT IS GOOGLE GEMINI AND HOW CAN YOU USE IT?” — Erik Hyrkas “Gemini Ultra (if Google is honest) Will Blow Our Minds ” — Tina Huang Highlight: 9.2 Social Media Data Chapter 9: Public OpinionArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Appendix Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 459459Table of Contents Chapter 1 Research and Development 460 Chapter 2 Technical Performance 465 Chapter 3 Responsible AI 472 Chapter 4 Economy 478 Chapter 5 Science and Medicine 488 Chapter 6 Education 491 Chapter 7 Policy and Governance 495 Chapter 8 Diversity 500 Chapter 9 Public Opinion 501 Appendix Appendix 460 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Chapter 1: Research and Development AppendixArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 1: Research and Development Acknowledgments The AI Index would like to acknowledge Ben Cottier and Robi Rahman from Epoch for leading the work analyzing machine learning training costs; Robi Rahman for leading work regarding the national affiliation of notable systems; and James da Costa, for doing coding work instrumental to the sectoral and national affiliation analysis of foundation models. AI Conference Attendance The AI Index reached out to the organizers of various AI conferences in 2023 and asked them to provide information on total attendance. Some conferences posted their attendance totals online; when this was the case, the AI Index used those reported totals and did not reach out to the conference organizers. CSET Prepared by Autumn Toney The Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) is a policy research organization within Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service that produces data-driven research at the intersection of security and technology, providing nonpartisan analysis to the policy community. For more information about how CSET analyzes bibliometric and patent data, see the Country Activity Tracker (CAT) documentation on the Emerging Technology Observatory’s website. 1 Using CAT, users can also interact with country bibliometric, patent, and investment data. 2 Publications From CSET Merged Corpus of Scholarly Literature Sources CSET’s merged corpus of scholarly literature combines distinct publications from Clarivate’s Web of Science, OpenAlex, The Lens, Semantic Scholar, arXiv, and Papers With Code. Updates: The source list of scholarly literature for CSET’s merged corpus has been changed from prior years, with the inclusion of OpenAlex, the Lens, and Semantic Scholar, and the exclusion of Digital Science’s Dimensions and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Methodology To create the merged corpus, CSET deduplicated across the listed sources using publication metadata, and then combined the metadata for linked publications. For analysis of AI publications, CSET used an English-language subset of this corpus published since 2010. CSET researchers developed a classifier for identifying AI-related publications by leveraging the arXiv repository, where authors and editors tag papers by subject. 3 Updates: The AI classifier was updated from the version used in prior years; Dunham, Melot, and Murdick 4 describe the previously implemented 1 https://eto.tech/tool-docs/cat/ 2 https://cat.eto.tech/ 3 Christian Schoeberl, Autumn Toney, and James Dunham, “Identifying AI Research” (Center for Security and Emerging Technology, July 2023), https://doi.org/10.51593/20220030. 4 James Dunham, Jennifer Melot, and Dewey Murdick, “Identifying the Development and Application of Artificial Intelligence in Scientific Text,” arXiv preprint, arXiv:2002.07143 (2020). Appendix 461 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Chapter 1: Research and Development AppendixArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 classifier; and Schoeberl, Toney, and Dunham describe the updated classifier used in this analysis. CSET matched each publication in the analytic corpus with predictions from a field-of-study model derived from Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)’s taxonomy, which yields hierarchical labels describing the published research field(s) of study and corresponding scores. 5 CSET researchers identified the most common fields of study in our corpus of AI-relevant publications since 2010 and recorded publications in all other fields as “Other AI.” English-language AI-relevant publications were then tallied by their top-scoring field and publication year. Updates: The methodology to assign MAG fields of study was updated from the methodology used in prior years. Toney and Dunham describe the field of study assignment pipeline used in this analysis; prior years used the original MAG implementation. CSET also provided publication counts and year-by- year citations for AI-relevant work associated with each country. A publication is associated with a country if it has at least one author whose organizational affiliation(s) is located in that country. If there is no observed country, the publication receives an “Unknown/Missing” country label. Citation counts aren’t available for all publications; those without counts weren’t included in the citation analysis. Over 70% of English-language AI papers published between 2010 and 2022 have citation data available. Additionally, publication counts by year and by publication type (e.g., academic journal articles, conference papers) were provided where available. These publication types were disaggregated by affiliation country as described above. CSET also provided publication affiliation sector(s) where, as in the country attribution analysis, sectors were associated with publications through authors’ affiliations. Not all affiliations were characterized in terms of sectors; CSET researchers relied primarily on ROR for this purpose, and not all organizations can be found in or linked to ROR. 6 Where the affiliation sector is available, papers were counted toward these sectors, by year. CSET counted cross-sector collaborations as distinct pairs of sectors across authors for each publication. Collaborations are only counted once: For example, if a publication has two authors with an academic affiliation and two with an industry affiliation, it is counted as a single academic-industry collaboration. Patents From CSET’s AI and Robotics Patents Dataset Source CSET’s AI patents dataset was developed by CSET and 1790 Analytics and includes data from The Lens, 1790 Analytics, and EPO’s PATSTAT. Patents relevant to the development and application of AI and robotics were identified by their CPC/IPC codes and keywords. Methodology In this analysis, patents were grouped by year and country, and then counted at the “patent family” 5 These scores are based on cosine similarities between field-of-study and paper embeddings. See Autumn Toney and James Dunham, “Multi-Label Classification of Scientific Research Documents Across Domains and Languages,” Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing (Association for Computational Linguistics, 2022): 105–14, https:// aclanthology.org/2022.sdp-1.12/. 6 See https://ror.org/ for more information about the ROR dataset. 7 Patents are analyzed at the “patent family” level rather than “patent document” level because patent families are a collective of patent documents all associated with a single invention and/ or innovation by the same inventors/assignees. Thus, counting at the “patent family” level mitigates artificial number inflation when there are multiple patent documents in a patent family or if a patent is filed in multiple jurisdictions. Appendix 462 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Chapter 1: Research and Development AppendixArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 level. 7 CSET extracted year values from the first publication date within a family. Countries are assigned to patents based on the country or filing office where a patent is first filed (e.g., if a patent is filed with the USPTO on January 1, 2020, and then with the German Patenting Office on January 2, 2020, the patent is classified as a patent with U.S. inventors).8 Note that the same patent may have multiple countries (but not years) attributed to it if the inventors filed their patent in multiple countries on the same first filing date (e.g., if a patent is filed with the USPTO on January 1, 2020, and then with the German Patenting Office on January 1, 2020, the patent is classified as a patent with U.S. inventors and as a patent with German inventors). Note that patents filed with supranational organizations, such as patents filed under WIPO (the World Intellectual Property Organization), EP (European Patent Organization), and EA (a special area of Spain not included in the European Union), also fall under the “Rest of World” category. Ecosystems Graph Analysis To track the distribution of AI foundation models by country, the AI Index team took the following steps: 1. A snapshot of the Ecosystems Graph was taken in early January 2024. 2. Authors of foundation models are attributed to countries based on their affiliation credited on the paper/technical documentation associated with the model. For international organizations, authors are attributed to the country where the organization is headquartered, unless a more specific location is indicated. 3. All of the landmark publications are aggregated within time periods (e.g., monthly or yearly) with the national contributions added up to determine what each country’s contribution to landmark AI research was during each time period. 4. The contributions of different countries are compared over time to identify any trends. Epoch Notable Models Analysis The AI forecasting research group Epoch maintains a dataset of landmark AI and ML models, along with accompanying information about their creators and publications, such as the list of their (co)authors, number of citations, type of AI task accomplished, and amount of compute used in training. The nationalities of the authors of these papers have important implications for geopolitical AI forecasting. As various research institutions and technology companies start producing advanced ML models, the global distribution of future AI development may shift or concentrate in certain places, which in turn affects the geopolitical landscape because AI is expected to become a crucial component of economic and military power in the near future. To track the distribution of AI research contributions on landmark publications by country, the Epoch dataset is coded according to the following methodology: 8 In CSET’s data analysis for the 2022 AI Index, we used the most recent publication date for a patent family. This method has the advantage of capturing updates within a patent family (such as amendments). However, to remain consistent with CSET’s other data products, including the Country Activity Tracker (available at https://cat.eto.tech/), we opted to use the first filing year instead in this data analysis. Appendix 463 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Chapter 1: Research and Development AppendixArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 1. A snapshot of the dataset was taken on January 1, 2024. This includes papers about landmark models, selected using the inclusion criteria of importance, relevance, and uniqueness, as described in the Compute Trends dataset documentation. 2. The authors are attributed to countries based on their affiliation credited on the paper. For international organizations, authors are attributed to the country where the organization is headquartered, unless a more specific location is indicated. 3. All of the landmark publications are aggregated within time periods (e.g., monthly or yearly) with the national contributions added up to determine what each country’s contribution to landmark AI research was during each time period. 4. The contributions of different countries are compared over time to identify any trends. GitHub Identifying AI Projects In partnership with researchers from Harvard Business School, Microsoft Research, and Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab, GitHub identifies public AI repositories following the methodologies of Gonzalez, Zimmerman, and Nagappan, 2020, and Dohmke, Iansiti, and Richards, 2023, using topic labels related to AI/ML and generative AI, respectively, along with the topics “machine learning,” “deep learning,” or “artificial intelligence.” GitHub further augments the dataset with repositories that have a dependency on the PyTorch, TensorFlow, or OpenAI libraries for Python. Mapping AI Projects to Geographic Areas Public AI projects are mapped to geographic areas using IP address geolocation to determine the mode location of a project’s owners each year. Each project owner is assigned a location based on their IP address when interacting with GitHub. If a project owner changes locations within a year, the location for the project would be determined by the mode location of its owners sampled daily in the year. Additionally, the last known location of the project owner is carried forward on a daily basis even if no activities were performed by the project owner that day. For example, if a project owner performed activities within the United States and then became inactive for six days, that project owner would be considered to be in the United States for that seven-day span. Training Cost Analysis To create the dataset of cost estimates, the Epoch database was filtered for models released during the large-scale ML era 9 that were above the median of training compute in a two-year window centered on their release date. This filtered for the largest-scale ML models. There were 138 qualifying systems based on these criteria. Of these systems, 48 had sufficient information to estimate the training cost. For the selected ML models, the training time and the type, quantity, and utilization rate of the training hardware were determined from the publication, press release, or technical reports, as applicable. Cloud rental prices for the computing hardware used by these models were collected from online historical archives of cloud vendors’ websites. 10 9 The selected cutoff date was September 1, 2015, in accordance with Compute Trends Across Three Eras of Machine Learning (Epoch, 2022). 10 Historic prices were collected from archived snapshots of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform price catalogs viewed through the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. Appendix 464 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Chapter 1: Research and Development AppendixArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Training costs were estimated from the hardware type, quantity, and time by multiplying the hourly cloud rental cost rates (at the time of training) 11 by the quantity of hardware hours. This yielded the cost to train each model using the same hardware used by the authors to train the same model at the time. However, some developers purchased hardware rather than renting cloud computers, so the true costs incurred by the developers may vary. Various challenges were encountered while estimating the training cost of these models. Often, the developers did not disclose the duration of training or the hardware that was used. In other cases, cloud compute pricing was not available for the hardware. The investigation of training cost trends is continued in a forthcoming Epoch report, including an expanded dataset with more models and hardware prices. 11 The chosen rental cost rate was the most recent published price for the hardware and cloud vendor used by the developer of the model, at a three-year commitment rental rate, after subtracting the training duration and two months from the publication date. If this price was not available, the most analogous price was used: the same hardware and vendor at a different date, otherwise the same hardware from a different cloud vendor. If a three-year commitment rental rate was unavailable, this was imputed from other rental rates based on the empirical average discount for the given cloud vendor. If the exact hardware type was not available, e.g., “NVIDIA A100 SXM4 40GB,” then a generalization was used, e.g., “NVIDIA A100.” Appendix 465Table of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 2: Technical Performance Appendix Chapter 2: Technical Performance Acknowledgments The AI Index would like to acknowledge Andrew Shi for his work doing a literature review on the environmental impact of AI models; Emily Capstick for her work studying the use of RLHF in machine learning models; Sukrut Oak for his work generating sample Midjourney generations; and Emma Williamson for her work identifying significant AI technical advancements for the timeline.

Environmental Impact To assess the environmental impact of AI models, the AI Index team surveyed technical reports of prominent foundation models to determine whether the model developers disclosed carbon emissions. The Index also reviewed papers by researchers that estimated the carbon footprint of various models. The technical reports surveyed, as well as the papers estimating the carbon impact of various models, are included in the works cited for this chapter. RLHF To identify foundation models using RLHF, the AI Index team reviewed the technical documentation of every foundation model included in the Ecosystem Graph, and searched for evidence that RLHF had been used in the model’s development process. The year in which a model is said to have used RLHF refers to the year the model was released.

Appendix 472 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Acknowledgments The AI Index would like to acknowledge Amelia Hardy for her work contributing as a research assistant to visualizations and supplementary analysis for this chapter, and Andrew Shi for his work spearheading the analysis of responsible AI-related conference submissions. The AI Index also acknowledges that the Global State of Responsible AI analysis was done in collaboration with Accenture. The AI Index specifically wants to highlight the contributions of Arnab Chakraborty, Patrick Connolly, Jakub Wiatrak, Ray Eitel- Porter, Dikshita Venkatesh, and Shekhar Tewari to the data collection and analysis. Conference Submissions Analysis For the analysis on responsible AI-related conference submissions, the AI Index examined the number of responsible AI–related academic submissions at the following conferences: AAAI, AIES, FAccT, ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS. Specifically, the team scraped the conference websites or repositories of conference submissions for papers containing relevant keywords indicating they could fall into a particular responsible AI category. The papers were then manually verified by a human team to confirm their categorization. It is possible that a single paper could belong to multiple responsible AI categories. Chapter 3: Responsible AI The keywords searched include: Fairness and bias: algorithmic fairness, bias detection, bias mitigation, discrimination, equity in AI, ethical algorithm design, fair data practices, fair ML, fairness and bias, group fairness, individual fairness, justice, non-discrimination, representational fairness, unfair, unfairness. Privacy and data governance: anonymity, confidentiality, data breach, data ethics, data governance, data integrity, data privacy, data protection, data transparency, differential privacy, inference privacy, machine unlearning, privacy by design, privacy-preserving, secure data storage, trustworthy data curation. Security: adversarial attack, adversarial learning, AI incident, attacks, audits, cybersecurity, ethical hacking, forensic analysis, fraud detection, red teaming, safety, security, security ethics, threat detection, vulnerability assessment. Transparency and explainability: algorithmic transparency, audit, auditing, causal reasoning, causality, explainability, explainable AI, explainable models, human-understandable decisions, interpretability, interpretable models, model explainability, outcome explanation, transparency, xAI. Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3: Responsible AI Appendix Appendix 473 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Consistency of Responsible AI Benchmark Reporting For each of the analyzed models (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude 2, Llama 2, Mistral 7B), the AI Index reviewed the official papers published by the model developers at the time of model release for reported academic benchmarks. The AI Index did not consider subsequent benchmark reports by the model developers or external parties. The AI Index also did not include benchmarks on academic or professional exams (e.g., the GRE), benchmarks for modalities other than text, or internal evaluation metrics. Global Responsible State of AI Survey Researchers from Stanford conducted a global responsible AI (RAI) survey in collaboration with Accenture. The objective of the questionnaire was to gain an understanding of the current level of RAI adoption globally and allow for a comparison of RAI activities across 19 industries and 22 countries. The survey is further used to develop an early snapshot of current perceptions around the responsible development, deployment, and use of generative AI and how this might affect RAI adoption and mitigation techniques. The survey covers a total of 10 RAI dimensions: Reliability; Privacy and Data Governance; Fairness and Nondiscrimination; Transparency and Explainability; Human Interaction; Societal and Environmental Well-Being; Accountability; Leadership/ Principles/Culture; Lawfulness and Compliance; and Organizational Governance. Only some of the survey findings are presented in the AI Index, with a more detailed report, the Global State of Responsible AI Report, coming out in May/June 2024. Given the limited scalability of user interviews, the researchers opted for a questionnaire-based approach to ensure broad coverage of organizations in different countries and industries. They contracted McGuire Research to run the recruitment and data collection. The team received more than 15,897 responses from 22 countries and 19 industries. The respondents were asked 10 qualifier questions in the survey. Companies were excluded if their global annual revenue was less than 500 million USD and/or the respondent had no visibility into the RAI decision-making process of the company. Included in the final sample were more than 1,000 organizations. The survey had a total of 38 questions, including the 10 qualifier questions. Below is the full list of measures respondents were asked about in the survey and which were referenced in the AI Index subchapters. The organizations could answer on a scale from Not applied, Ad-hoc, Rolling out, or Fully operationalized. The companies were further given the option to select Other and provide information on mitigation measures not listed. Fairness measures: • Collection of representative data based on the anticipated user demographics • Making methodology and data sources accessible to third parties (auditors/general public) for independent oversight • Involvement of diverse stakeholders in model development and/or review process • Assessment of performance across different demographic groups • Use of technical bias mitigation techniques during model development • Other (selection of this option opened an optional free-text field) Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3: Responsible AI Appendix Appendix 474 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Data governance measures: • Checks to ensure that the data complies with all relevant laws and regulations and is used with consent, where applicable • Data collection and preparation include assessment of the completeness, uniqueness, consistency, and accuracy of the data • Checks to ensure that the data is representative with respect to the demographic setting within which the final model/system is used • Regular data audits and updates to ensure the relevancy of the data • Process for dataset documentation and traceability throughout the AI life cycle • Remediation plans for and documentation of datasets with shortcomings • Other (selection of this option opened an optional free-text field) Transparency and explainability: • Documentation of the development process, detailing algorithm design choices, data sources, intended use cases, and limitations • Training programs for stakeholders (incl. users) covering the intended use cases and limitations of the model • Prioritization of simpler models where high interpretability is crucial, even if it sacrifices some performance • Use model explainability tools (e.g., saliency maps) to elucidate model decisions • Other (selection of this option opened an optional free-text field) Reliability measures: • Mitigation measures for model errors and handling low confidence outputs • Failover plans or other measures to ensure the system’s/model’s availability • Evaluation of models/systems for vulnerabilities or harmful behavior (i.e., red teaming) • Measures to prevent adversarial attacks • Confidence scoring for model outputs • Comprehensive test cases that cover a wide range of scenarios and metrics • Other (selection of this option opened an optional free-text field) Security measures: • Basic cybersecurity hygiene practices (e.g., multifactor authentication, access controls, and employee training) • Vetting and validation of cybersecurity measures of third parties in the supply chain • Dedicated AI cybersecurity team and/or personnel explicitly trained for AI-specific cybersecurity • Technical AI-specific cybersecurity checks and measures, e.g., adversarial testing, vulnerability assessments, and data security measures • Resources dedicated to research and monitoring of evolving AI-specific cybersecurity risks and integration in existing cybersecurity processes • Other (selection of this option opened an optional free-text field) Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 3: Responsible AI Appendix Appendix 475 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Works Cited Agarwal, A. & Agarwal, H.

Lightcast collects postings from over 51,000 online job sites to develop a comprehensive, real-time portrait of labor market demand. It aggregates job postings, removes duplicates, and extracts data from job postings text. This includes information on job title, employer, industry, and region, as well as required experience, education, and skills. Job postings are useful for understanding trends in the labor market because they allow for a detailed, real-time look at the skills employers seek. To assess the representativeness of job postings data, Lightcast conducts a number of analyses to compare the distribution of job postings to the distribution of official government and other third-party sources in the United States. The primary source of government data on U.S. job postings is the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) program, conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Based on comparisons between JOLTS and Lightcast, the labor market demand captured by Lightcast data represents over 99% of the total labor demand. Jobs not posted online are usually in small businesses (the classic example being the “Help Wanted” sign in the restaurant window) and union hiring halls. Measuring Demand for AI In order to measure the demand by employers of AI skills, Lightcast uses its skills taxonomy of over 30,000 skills. The list of AI skills from Lightcast data are shown below, with associated skill clusters. While some skills are considered to be in the AI cluster specifically, for the purposes of this report, all skills below were considered AI skills. A job posting was considered an AI job if it mentioned any of these skills in the job text.

Estimation LinkedIn Prepared by Murat Erer, Carl Shan, and Akash Kaura Country Sample Included countries represent a select sample of eligible countries with at least 40% labor force coverage by LinkedIn and at least 10 AI hires in any given month. India, despite not reaching 40% coverage, was included in this sample because of its increasing importance in the global economy. Skills (AI Engineering and AI Literacy skills) LinkedIn members self-report their skills on their LinkedIn profiles. Currently, more than 41,000 distinct, standardized skills are identified by LinkedIn. These have been coded and classified by taxonomists at LinkedIn into 249 skill groupings, which are the skill groups represented in the dataset. Skill groupings are derived by expert taxonomists through a similarity-index methodology that measures skill composition at the industry level. LinkedIn’s industry taxonomy and their corresponding NAICS codes can be found here. This year LinkedIn made updates to the AI skills list and categorized them into “AI Engineering” and “AI Literacy” skills. See “AI Skills List Update Compared to Last Year” section for more details. Skills Genome For any entity (occupation or job, country, sector, etc.), the skill genome is an ordered list (a vector) of the 50 “most characteristic skills” of that entity. These most characteristic skills are identified using a TF-IDF algorithm to identify the most representative skills of the target entity, while down-ranking ubiquitous skills that add little information about that specific entity (e.g., Microsoft Word). Appendix 481 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Chapter 4: Economy AppendixArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 TF-IDF is a statistical measure that evaluates how representative a word (in this case, a skill) is to a selected entity). This is done by multiplying two metrics: 1. The term frequency of a skill in an entity (“TF”). 2. The logarithmic inverse entity frequency of the skill across a set of entities (“IDF”). This indicates how common or rare a word is in the entire entity set. The closer IDF is to 0, the more common a word is. So, if the skill is very common across LinkedIn entities, and appears in many job or member descriptions, the IDF will approach 0. If, on the other hand, the skill is unique to specific entities, the IDF will approach 1. Details are available at LinkedIn’s Skills Genome and LinkedIn–World Bank Methodology note. AI Skills Penetration The aim of this indicator is to measure the intensity of AI skills in an entity (in a particular country, industry, gender, etc.) through the following methodology: • Compute frequencies for all self-added skills by LinkedIn members in a given entity (occupation, industry, etc.) in 2015–2023. • Re-weight skill frequencies using a TF-IDF model to get the top 50 most representative skills in that entity. These 50 skills compose the “skill genome” of that entity. • Compute the share of skills that belong to the AI skill group out of the top skills in the selected entity. Interpretation: The AI skill penetration rate signals the prevalence of AI skills across occupations, or the intensity with which LinkedIn members utilize AI skills in their jobs. For example, the top 50 skills for the occupation of engineer are calculated based on the weighted frequency with which they appear in LinkedIn members’ profiles. If four of the skills that engineers possess belong to the AI skill group, this measure indicates that the penetration of AI skills is estimated to be 8% among engineers (e.g., 4/50). Jobs or Occupations LinkedIn member titles are standardized and grouped into approximately 15,000 occupations. These are not sector- or country-specific. These occupations are further standardized into approximately 3,600 occupation representatives. Occupation representatives group occupations with a common role and specialty, regardless of seniority. AI Jobs or Occupations An “AI” job is an occupation representative that requires AI skills to perform the job. Skills penetrations are used as a signal for whether AI skills are prevalent in an occupation representative, in any sector where the occupation representative may exist. Examples of such occupations include (but are not limited to): Machine Learning Engineer, Artificial Intelligence Specialist, Data Scientist, and Computer Vision Engineer. AI Talent A LinkedIn member is considered AI talent if they have explicitly added AI skills to their profile and/or they are occupied in an AI occupation representative. The counts of AI talent are used to calculate talent concentration metrics. For example, to calculate the country-level AI talent concentration, we use the counts of AI talent at the country level vis-a-vis the counts of LinkedIn members in the respective countries. Note that concentration metrics may be influenced by LinkedIn coverage in these countries and should be utilized with caution. Appendix 482 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Chapter 4: Economy AppendixArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Relative AI Skills Penetration To allow for skills penetration comparisons across countries, the skills genomes are calculated and a relevant benchmark is selected (e.g., global average). A ratio is then constructed between a country’s and the benchmark’s AI skills penetrations, controlling for occupations. Interpretation: A country’s relative AI skills penetration of 1.5 indicates that AI skills are 1.5 times as frequent as in the benchmark, for an overlapping set of occupations. Global Comparison For cross-country comparison, we present the relative penetration rate of AI skills, measured as the sum of the penetration of each AI skill across occupations in a given country, divided by the average global penetration of AI skills across the overlapping occupations in a sample of countries. Interpretation: A relative penetration rate of 2 means that the average penetration of AI skills in that country is two times the global average across the same set of occupations. Global Comparison: By Industry The relative AI skills penetration by country for industry provides an in-depth sectoral decomposition of AI skill penetration across industries and sample countries. Interpretation: A country’s relative AI skill penetration rate of 2 in the education sector means that the average penetration of AI skills in that country is two times the global average across the same set of occupations in that sector. Global Comparison: By Gender The “Relative AI Skills Penetration by Gender” metric provides a cross-country comparison of AI skill penetrations within each gender, comparing countries’ male/female AI skill penetrations to the global average of the same gender. Since the global averages are distinct for each gender, this metric should only be used to compare country rankings within each gender, and not for cross-gender comparisons within countries. Interpretation: A country’s AI skills penetration for women of 1.5 means that female members in that country are 1.5 times more likely to list AI skills than the average female member in all countries pooled together across the same set of occupations that exist in the country/gender combination. Global Comparison: Across Genders The “Relative AI Skills Penetration Across Genders” metric allows for cross-gender comparisons within and across countries globally, since we compare the countries’ male/female AI skill penetrations to the same global average regardless of gender. Relative AI Talent Hiring Rate YoY Ratio • LinkedIn Hiring Rate or Overall Hiring Rate is a measure of hires normalized by LinkedIn membership. It is computed as the percentage of LinkedIn members who added a new employer in the same period the job began, divided by the total number of LinkedIn members in the corresponding location. • AI Hiring Rate is computed following the overall hiring rate methodology, but only considering members classified as AI talent. • Relative AI Talent Hiring Rate YoY Ratio is the year-over-year change in AI Hiring Rate relative to Overall Hiring Rate in the same country. For each month, we first calculate AI Hiring rate in the country, then divide AI Hiring Rate by Overall Hiring Rate in that country, Appendix 483 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Chapter 4: Economy AppendixArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 then calculate YoY change of this ratio, and then take the 12-month moving average using the last 12 months. Interpretation: In 2023 in India, the ratio of AI talent hiring relative to overall hiring has grown 16.8% year over year. AI Talent Migration Data on migration comes from the World Bank Group– LinkedIn “Digital Data for Development” partnership (please see Zhu et al. [2018]). LinkedIn migration rates are derived from the self- identified locations of LinkedIn member profiles. For example, when a LinkedIn member updates his or her location from Paris to London, this is counted as a migration. Migration data is available from 2019 onward. LinkedIn data provides insights into countries on the AI Talent gained or lost due to migration trends. AI Talent migration is considered for all members with AI Skills/holding AI jobs at time t for country A as the country of interest and country B as the source of inflows and destination for outflows. Thus, net AI Talent migration between country A and country B—for country A—is calculated as follows: Net flows are defined as total arrivals minus departures within the given time period. LinkedIn membership varies considerably between countries, which makes interpreting absolute movements of members from one country to another difficult. To compare migration flows between countries fairly, migration flows are normalized for the country of interest. For example, if country A is the country of interest, all absolute net flows into and out of country A, regardless of origin and destination countries, are normalized based on LinkedIn membership in country A at the end of each year and multiplied by 10,000. Hence, this metric indicates relative talent migration from all countries to and from country A. AI Skills List Update Compared to Last Year 1. LinkedIn introduced “AI Literacy” skills. a.

Quid Quid Insights prepared by Bill Valle and Heather English Quid uses its own in-house LLM and other smart search features, as well as traditional Boolean query, to search for focus areas, topics, and keywords within many datasets: social media, news, forums and blogs, companies, patents, as well as other custom feeds of data (e.g., survey data). Quid has many visualization options and data delivery endpoints, including network graphs based on semantic similarity, in-platform dashboarding capabilities, as well as programmatic PostgreSQL database delivery, and so on. Quid applies best-in-class AI and NLP to reveal hidden patterns in large datasets, enabling users to make data-driven decisions accurately, quickly, and efficiently. Search, Data Sources, and Scope Over 8 million global public and private company profiles from multiple data sources are indexed to search across company descriptions, while filtering and including metadata ranging from investment information to firmographic information, such as founded year, HQ location, and more. Company information is updated on a weekly basis. The Quid algorithm reads a large amount of text data from each document to make links between different documents based on their similar language. This process is repeated at an immense scale, which produces a network with different clusters identifying distinct topics or focus areas. Trends are identified based on keywords, phrases, people, companies, and institutions that Quid identifies, and the other metadata that is put into the software. Data Companies Organization data is embedded from Capital IQ and Crunchbase. These companies include all types of organizations (private, public, operating, operating as a subsidiary, out of business) throughout the world. The investment data includes private investments, M&A, public offerings, minority stakes made by PE/ VCs, corporate venture arms, governments, and institutions both within and outside the United States. Some data is simply unreachable—for instance, when investors’ names or funding amounts are undisclosed. Quid embeds Capital IQ data as a default and adds in data from Crunchbase for the data points Appendix 485 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Chapter 4: Economy AppendixArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 that are not captured in Capital IQ. This not only yields comprehensive and accurate data on all global organizations, but it also captures early-stage startups and funding events data. Company information is updated on a weekly basis. Earnings Calls Quid leverages earnings call transcript data embedded from Seeking Alpha. For this report, Quid has analyzed mentions of AI-related keywords across all earnings call transcripts from Fortune 500 companies from January 2018 through December 2023. New earnings call transcript data is updated in Quid on the 1st and 15th of every month. Search Parameters Boolean query is used to search for focus areas, topics, and keywords within the archived company database, within their business descriptions and websites. We can filter out the search results by HQ regions, investment amount, operating status, organization type (private/ public), and founding year. Quid then visualizes these companies by semantic similarity. If there are more than 7,000 companies from the search result, Quid selects the 7,000 most relevant companies for visualization based on the language algorithm. Boolean search: “artificial intelligence” or “AI” or “machine learning” or “deep learning” Companies • Global AI and ML companies that have received investments (private, IPO, M&A) from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2023. • Global AI and ML companies that have received over $1.5M for the last 10 years (January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2023). • Global data was also pulled for a Generative AI query (Boolean search: “generative AI” OR “gen AI” OR “generative artificial intelligence”) for companies that have received over $1.5M for the last 10 years (January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2023). Target Event Definitions • Private investments: A private placement is a private sale of newly issued securities (equity or debt) by a company to a selected investor or a selected group of investors. The stakes that buyers take in private placements are often minority stakes (under 50%), although it is possible to take control of a company through a private placement as well, in which case the private placement would be a majority stake investment. • Minority investment: These refer to minority stake acquisitions in Quid, which take place when the buyer acquires less than 50% of the existing ownership stake in entities, asset products, and business divisions. • M&A: This refers to a buyer acquiring more than 50% of the existing ownership stake in entities, asset products, and business divisions. McKinsey & Company Data used in the Corporate Activity–Industry Adoption section was sourced from the McKinsey Global Survey “The State of AI in 2023: Generative AI’s Breakout Year.” The online survey was in the field April 11, 2023, to April 21, 2023, and garnered responses from 1,684 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 913 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one function Appendix 486 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Chapter 4: Economy AppendixArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 and were asked questions about their organization’s AI use. To adjust for differences in response rates, the data is weighted by the contribution of each respondent’s nation to global GDP. The AI Index also considered data from previous iterations of the survey. More specifically, the AI index made use of data from: The State of AI in 2022—and a Half Decade in Review The State of AI in 2021 The State of AI in 2020 AI Proves Its Worth, But Few Scale Impact (2019) AI Adoption Advances, But Foundational Barriers Remain (2018) Stack Overflow Data on the use of AI by developers was sourced from the 2023 Developer Survey. The survey was conducted from May 8, 2023, to May 19, 2023, and incorporates the insights of 89,184 software developers from 185 countries around the world.

Appendix 491 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Code.org State-Level Data The following link includes a full description of the methodology used by Code.org to collect its data. The staff at Code.org also maintains a database of the state of American K–12 education and, in this policy primer, provides a greater amount of detail on the state of American K–12 education in each state. AP Computer Science Data The AP Computer Science data is provided to Code.org as per an agreement the College Board maintains with Code.org. The AP Computer Science data comes from the college board’s national and state summary reports. Access to Computer Science Education Data on access to computer science education was drawn from Code.org’s State of Computer Science Education 2023 report. Computing Research Association (CRA Taulbee Survey) Note: This year’s AI Index reused the methodological notes that were submitted by the CRA for previous editions of the AI Index. For more complete delineations of the methodology used by the CRA, please consult the individual CRA surveys that are linked below. Chapter 6: Education Computing Research Association (CRA) members are 200-plus North American organizations active in computing research: academic departments of computer science and computer engineering; laboratories and centers in industry, government, and academia; and affiliated professional societies (AAAI, ACM, CACS/AIC, IEEE Computer Society, SIAM USENIX). CRA’s mission is to enhance innovation by joining with industry, government, and academia to strengthen research and advance education in computing. Learn more about CRA here. The CRA Taulbee Survey gathers survey data during the fall of each academic year by reaching out to over 200 PhD-granting departments. Details about the Taulbee Survey can be found here. Taulbee doesn’t directly survey the students. The department identifies each new PhD’s area of specialization as well as their type of employment. Data is collected from September to January of each academic year for PhDs awarded in the previous academic year. Results are published in May after data collection closes. The CRA Taulbee Survey is sent only to doctoral departments of computer science, computer engineering, and information science/systems. Historically, (a) Taulbee covers one-quarter to one-third of total BS CS recipients in the United States; (b) the percentage of women earning bachelor’s degrees is lower in the Taulbee schools than overall; and (c) Taulbee tracks the trends in overall CS production. Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 6: Education Appendix Appendix 492 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents The AI Index used data from the following iterations of the CRA survey: CRA, 2022 CRA, 2021 CRA, 2020 CRA, 2019 CRA, 2018 CRA, 2017 CRA, 2016 CRA, 2015 CRA, 2014 CRA, 2013 CRA, 2012 CRA, 2011 Impact Research Data on the usage of ChatGPT in schools among teachers and students came from two Impact Research surveys released in 2023. To learn more about the methodology employed for the surveys, please visit the following links: March 2023 and July 2023. Informatics Europe The statistics are annually collected by Informatics Europe and published on the Informatics Europe Higher Education Data Portal, which is updated with the most recent data at the end of the year (typically in December). In the interest of reliability, Informatics Europe collects the data from countries where a solid and reasonably complete picture could be drawn from official sources such as national statistical offices, educational agencies, or ministries. The full list of sources can be found in the Data Portal section “Data Sources.” The Data Portal follows the definitions and concepts provided by these national agencies and reflects the national situation in the countries considered. Those aspects that are not exposed by the consulted agencies are not part of the dataset. A full list of definitions and concepts used can be found in the footnotes shown at the bottom of the Statistics section. Since each national data repository has its own structure and quite often provides all supporting information in the national language, Informatics Europe consults with its members—academics, active and knowledgeable in the informatics field from respective countries—who help to interpret the statistics available and who understand the specificities of these countries’ higher education systems. One of the main challenges in integrating the statistical data is the identification of terms used to define the informatics discipline in different countries. Informatics is known under different names in different European languages and countries, and in English as well. A good dozen terms (presented in the Data Portal section “Subjects”) are used to denote what is fundamentally the same discipline, and the role of national experts here is to help with screening the terms and programs and identifying which part of them is pertinent to the informatics field. The data covers the degrees delivered by both traditional Research Universities (RU) and University of Applied Science (UAS) for the countries where these institutions also offer bachelor’s and master’s studies in informatics. The full list of institutions covered can be found in the Data Portal section “Institutions & Academic Units.” Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 6: Education Appendix Appendix 493 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Studyportals Studyportals is the world’s most comprehensive study choice platform. It lists over 200,000 English-taught programs from more than 3,500 institutions, helping over 50 million students per year. The Studyportals analytics and consulting team uses the resulting data to provide higher education organizations with real- time market insights. Studyportals categorizes the study programs on its portals into disciplines and subdisciplines. The 15 disciplines are broad categories of educational fields to help navigate the portals. The 284 subdisciplines are narrower topics, subdivisions, or specialized areas of disciplines. Paying clients can provide input, but ultimately, data processors manually choose the one-to-three closest fitting subdisciplines according to the following scenarios, listed in decreasing order of likelihood: Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 6: Education Appendix 1. Classic scenario: When the study name closely matches one subdiscipline name. a. “Chemistry” -> subdiscipline Chemistry. 2. Classic interdisciplinary scenario: When the study name closely matches two or three subdiscipline names. a. “International Fashion Management and Marketing” -> subdisciplines Fashion Management + Marketing. 3. Specializations scenario: When not all the subdisciplines are mentioned in the study name, but they are listed as specific specializations, concentrations, or tracks. a. “Business Administration with specializations in Finance and International Business” -> subdisciplines Business Administration + Finance + International Business 4. Mixed scenario: When the study name does not closely match any specific subdiscipline but can be represented by combining two or three subdisciplines. a. “Financial Economics” -> subdisciplines Finance + Economics 5. Last resort scenario: When the study name does not closely match any specific subdiscipline and/or combination, it is instead approximated as closely as possible. a. “UK, EU, and US Copyright Law” -> subdisciplines Patent & Intellectual Property Law + International Law + European Law Appendix 494 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Chapter 6: Education Appendix Scenario Example study name Example assigned subdisciplines Study name closely matches one subdiscipline name.

Additionally, the Index would like to acknowledge the efforts of Ethan Duncan He-Li Hellman, Julia Betts Lotufo, Alexandra Rome, and Emma Williamson in collecting, coding, and analyzing AI-related legislation and regulations. The Index is also grateful for the guidance provided by Caroline Meinhardt on AI legislation and regulation tracking. Global AI Mentions For mentions of AI in AI-related legislative proceedings around the world, the AI Index performed searches of the keyword “artificial intelligence” on the websites of 82 countries’ congresses or parliaments (in the respective languages), usually under sections named “minutes,” “hansard,” etc. In some cases, databases were only searchable by title, so site search functions were deployed. The AI Index team surveyed the following databases: Andorra, Angola, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, Bhutan, Brazil, Cabo, Verde, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, 12 Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, The Gambia, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Ireland, Isle of Man, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kosovo, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macao SAR, China, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Moldova, Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Mariana Islands, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Samoa, San Marino, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Zambia, Zimbabwe Global Legislation Records on AI For AI-related bills passed into laws, the AI Index performed searches of the keyword “artificial intelligence” on the websites of 128 countries’ congresses or parliaments (in the respective languages) in the full text of bills. Note that only laws passed by state-level legislative bodies and signed into law (i.e., by presidents or through royal assent) from 2016 to 2023 are included. Laws that were approved but then repealed are not included in the analysis. In some cases, there were databases that were only searchable by title, so site search functions were deployed. Future AI Index reports hope to include analysis on other types of legal documents, such as regulations and standards, adopted by state- or supranational-level legislative bodies, government agencies, etc. The AI Index team surveyed databases for the following countries: 12 The National People’s Congress is held once per year and does not provide full legislative proceedings. Hence, the counts included in the analysis only searched mentions of “artificial intelligence” in the only public document released from the Congress meetings, the Report on the Work of the Government, delivered by the premier. Appendix 496 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Albania, Algeria, American Samoa, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia Austria, Azerbaijan The Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Bermuda, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, Cuba, Curacao, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Faroe Islands, Fiji, Finland, France, The Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Greenland, Grenada, Guam, Guatemala, Guyana, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Iran Islamic Republic, Iraq, Ireland, Isle of Man, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Korea Republic, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macao SAR China, Malawi, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Nauru, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Northern Marina Islands, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, St. Kitts and Nevis, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Togo, Tongo, Turkey, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe The legislation was then coded by a team of two human coders for: (1) relevance to AI, (2) regulatory approach, and (3) subject matter. The relevance to AI categories were low, medium, and high. The regulatory approach categories were expansive or restrictive. For the subject matter categories, the Index employed the Congress policy typology. In cases where there were disagreements on the coding schemas, a third coder was brought in to settle the differences. EU AI Regulation The AI Index also gathered information on AI-related regulations enacted in the European Union between 2017 and 2023. To compile this data, the Index team conducted a keyword search for “artificial intelligence” on EUR-Lex, a comprehensive database of EU legislation, regulations, and case law. EUR- Lex provides access to a wide range of regulatory documents, such as legal acts, consolidated texts, international agreements, preparatory documents, and legislative procedures. The analysis in this section focused exclusively on documents with binding regulatory authority. The search for AI-related regulation in the European Union was limited to legal acts, international agreements, and consolidated texts. The regulation was then coded by a team of two human coders for: (1) relevance to AI, (2) regulatory approach, and (3) subject matter. The relevance to AI categories were low, medium, and high. The regulatory approach categories were expansive or restrictive. For the subject matter categories, the Index employed the Congress policy typology. In cases where there were disagreements on the coding schemas, a third coder was brought in to settle the differences. Federal Budget for Nondefense AI R&D Data on the federal U.S. budget for nondefense AI R&D was taken from previous editions of the AI Index (namely the 2021 and 2022 versions) and from the following National Science and Technology Council reports: Chapter 7: Policy and Governance Appendix Appendix 497 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Supplement to the President’s FY 2024 Budget Supplement to the President’s FY 2023 Budget Supplement to the President’s FY2022 Budget Govini Govini is a defense technology company. Ark, Govini’s flagship software, is a suite of AI-enabled applications, powered by integrated government and commercial data, that accelerate the Defense Acquisition Process. With Ark, the acquisition community eliminates slow, manual processes and gains the ability to rapidly imagine, produce, and field critical warfighting capabilities. Analysts and decision- makers are equipped to solve challenges across the entire spectrum of Defense Acquisition, including Supply Chain, Science and Technology, Production, Sustainment, and Modernization. Govini curated USG AI spend data from their annual Scorecard Taxonomy by applying supervised machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to parse, analyze, and categorize large volumes of federal contracts data, including prime contracts, grants, and other transaction authority (OTA) awards. Govini’s most recent Scorecard focused on Critical Technologies, of which AI/ML Technologies and Microelectronics were segments. The AI/ML segment consisted of five subsegments: Data Integration, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Autonomy, and Natural Language Processing. Microelectronics is divided into two subsegments: Memory and Processing, and Semiconductors. By initially generating search terms and then subsequently excluding specific terms that yield erroneous results, Govini delivers a comprehensive yet discriminant taxonomy of subsegments that are mutually exclusive. Repeated keyword searches and filters allow a consensus, data-driven taxonomy to come into focus. Govini SMEs conduct final review of taxonomic structure to complement this iterative, data-driven process. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and supervised ML models enables analysis of the large volumes of irregular data contained in federal contracts— data that often is inaccessible through regular government reporting processes or human-intensive analytical approaches. Moreover, beyond simply making usable an expansive body of data sources, Govini’s Ark platform and National Security Knowledge Graph establishes high-fidelity standards in categorized and fused data to produce a comprehensive and accurate depiction of federal spending, and the supporting vendor ecosystem, over time. National AI Strategies The AI Index did a web search to identify national strategies on AI. Below is a list of countries that were identified as having a national AI strategy, including a link to said strategy. For certain counties, noted with an asterisk (*), the actual strategy was not found, and a news article confirming the launch of the strategy was linked instead.

It provides an analysis of the total number of regulations, as well as their topics, scope, regulatory intent, and originating agencies. To compile this data, the AI Index team performed a keyword search for “artificial intelligence” on the Federal Register, a comprehensive repository of government documents from nearly all branches of the American government, encompassing more than 436 agencies. The regulation was then coded by a team of two human coders for: (1) relevance to AI, (2) regulatory approach, and (3) subject matter. The relevance to AI categories were low, medium, and high. The regulatory approach categories were expansive or restrictive. For the subject matter categories, the Index employed the Congress policy typology. In cases where there were disagreements on the coding schemas, a third coder was brought in to settle differences. US Department of Defense Budget Requests Data on the DoD nonclassified AI-related budget requests was taken from previous editions of the AI Index (namely the 2021 and 2022 versions) and from the following reports: Defense Budget Overview United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Request Defense Budget Overview United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request Defense Budget Overview United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request US State-Level AI Legislation For AI-related bills passed into law, the AI Index performed searches of the keyword “artificial intelligence” on the legislative websites of all 50 U.S. states in the full text of bills. Bills are only counted as passed into law if the final version of the bill includes the keyword, not just the introduced version. Note that only laws passed from 2015 to 2022 are included. The count for proposed laws includes both Chapter 7: Policy and Governance Appendix Appendix 499 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Table of Contents Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 laws that were proposed and eventually passed as well as laws that were proposed that have not yet been passed, or are now inactive.
