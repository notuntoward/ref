The next big disruption is here, ready to shift the economy and change the way we live and work forever ― much as personal computers, the internet, and smartphones did. It’s known as generative AI. After the 30 November 2022 release of OpenAI's GPT-3.5, a landmark example of generative AI, this new type of intelligence in machines has taken the world by storm. Unlike traditional AI known since the 1950s, generative AI doesn’t just process existing data. It learns from it and uses what it has learned to generate new creations that didn’t exist before, including text, images, videos, and code.  Tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, Google's Bard, and IBM Watson are swiftly democratizing generative AI for business and private applications. As this technology develops, experts predict tectonic changes.  Skills will evolve. Smaller players will gain creative and technical powers once exclusive to big organizations. Education will become more personalized, and healthcare breakthroughs should be expected too. As this technology develops, experts predict tectonic changes.  Skills will evolve. Smaller players will gain creative and technical powers once exclusive to big organizations. Education will become more personalized, and healthcare breakthroughs should be expected too. The transformation will take time, but it won’t be long. The speed at which this technology is being adopted for innovation is breathtaking. So, a key question business leaders face today is: what’s in this for their business right now? What steps can they take to ride this wave of disruption? We’ve prepared this ebook to help you find the answer. Introduction If we put generative AI together with the basket of automation technologies, we're looking at a potential of $4.4 trillion of GDP growth globally. That is larger than the size of the United Kingdom. “ ”McKinsey Stunning Generative AI Statistics Two months after its launch in November 2022, OpenAI’s virtual chatbot ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history 01 . 67% of senior IT leaders plan to prioritize generative AI for business in the next 18 months, with 33% considering it a top priority  05 . By 2025, generative AI will account for 10% of all data produced, up from less than 1% currently 06 . By 2024, 60% of the data used to develop AI and analytics projects will be generated synthetically07 . The article about ChatGPT was the most viewed page on Wikipedia in 2023, receiving more than 49.4 million page views02 . 2 3 4 7 6 5 Industries that are expected to be the first to take advantage of OpenAI’s solutions include technology, education, business services, manufacturing, and finance  03 . Around 30% of companies are already regularly using generative AI in at least one function, and 40 percent of those reporting AI adoption at their organisation plan to invest more in AI because of generative AI advances 04 . 1At the heart of ChatGPT's breakthrough is a journey spanning decades of AI research, culminating in an exceptionally user friendly tool that revolutionizes how machines understand and generate language.  Trained on 175 billion parameters, ChatGPT's model understands language nuances and complexities in a profoundly deep way. But why is language so crucial?  The thing is that language is the key to human intelligence. It plays a central role in cognitive processes, influencing everything from problem-solving and memory to abstract thinking. The technology behind ChatGPT, known as large language models (LLMs), mimics such cognitive processes. While LLMs can't exactly replicate human thought, they can process and analyze vast amounts of data at a speed surpassing the human brain. This ability also allows them to generate human-like responses just as quickly. Why ChatGPT Has Made A Difference The first phase of generative AI's adoption will be subtle yet significant. Its primary role will be to bolster human skills, enabling quicker and more efficient task completion, including summarizing and interpreting large datasets, speeding up the discovery process in research, or improving reporting.  According to a recent study by OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania, current LLMs can already take over half of the tasks in one-fifth of jobs. And this is just the beginning. As AI integrates deeper, its role will shift from supportive to transformative. We will see AI performing tasks in ways previously unachievable. This will revolutionize not just our work but also how businesses operate, their models, how value is created, and how entire business ecosystems interact. 8 The Impact Will Come in Waves Immediate Steps for Business Leaders to Seize the Moment Mitigate Risks: Though powerful, generative AI doesn't inherently understand the concepts of justice, safety, inclusion, or truth. It's crucial to recognize these limitations and establish a framework for responsible AI use to prevent biases, errors, and ethical issues 01 . Invest in AI Education and Training: Work with HR teams to develop comprehensive training programs to build AI literacy across your organization, ensuring that employees are equipped to work effectively with AI technologies 02 . These steps are essential for strategically placing your organization in the era of generative AI. The first key move is a shift in the mindset to embrace the disruption.

It does this by taking over routine tasks and supercharging customer experiences, including: Experts estimate that companies using generative AI tools could cut their customer service costs by up to 30%. The impact is expected to be especially profound in banking and insurance. In banking, generative AI can integrate a wealth of data like past orders, transactions, customer interactions, demographic information, and other information to really get to know your customer. In insurance, it can empower agents with instant access to detailed policy information and claims history, enabling them to offer customized solutions on the spot. 11 Software Engineering Generative AI has great potential to speed up and improve the whole process of software development.  But not just for programmers, generative AI is a game-changer for project managers, business analysts, coders, and testers too, giving them new tools to do their jobs better. Software engineering tasks where AI is able to make a great contribution include: Another McKinsey study has recently found that using AI can cut the time for documenting code for maintainability by half, reduce new code writing time by nearly half, and shorten the time for optimizing or refactoring existing code to about two-thirds. Generating Test Data: Generative AI can create realistic and diverse test data that helps check for weaknesses and how software behaves Optimizing Testing: Using requirements, the technology can find the best testing paths for maximum coverage, prioritizing test cases based on their importance and potential impact Thorough Vulnerability Testing: By generating a wide range of test inputs and analyzing past test results and system logs, generative AI finds weaknesses that manual tests might miss Automating Documentation: It is a big help in documentation too, automatically creating user guides, change logs, and code comments Gathering and Documenting Requirements: Generative AI can streamline this phase by compiling information from various sources, including existing documents and user feedback, and converting interviews and brainstorming sessions into clear requirement documents Planning and Estimation: Generative AI's skill in learning from existing data enables it to improve resource allocation and estimation accuracy, and it is quick in generating work schedules or keeping tabs on project progress Coding and Optimization: Generative AI is already helping with code generation, suggestions, and autocomplete. It's also valuable for refining code, finding bugs, and making sure everything runs smoothly 12More Function-Specific Use Cases Compared to traditional business automation tools, including those powered by basic AI, generative AI applications are broader and more complex.  Here's a look at the language-centric business processes where generative AI is likely to make the biggest impact through automation Performing managerial activities, such as prioritizing tasks in project management applications, scheduling meetings, and organizing email Searching for accurate information across your IT systems and summarizing content through a conversational interfac Creating standard or custom documents and reports automaticall Entering information into technology systems Business Process Automation  Generative AI's unique advantage lies in its ability to interpret human-like text and learn from it. This adaptability is particularly crucial given that about 25% of all work involves language-based tasks.  Data analytics is another growing application of generative AI. Generative AI holds the potential to transform self-service business intelligence and AI-powered analytics in several key ways Strategic Decision Making: Beyond just interpreting complex data, generative AI is invaluable in formulating strategies, predicting future trends, and automatically generating and customizing comprehensive reports for informed decision-makin Data Democratization: Generative AI is instrumental in democratizing data, making intricate data analyses accessible to non-technical staff via a simple chat.

Techwise, there are two main strategies your company can follow with generative AI: adopting readily available AI tools as they are for innovation or adapting these tools to your specific business context. Your final decision will depend on what you want to achieve. Adopt: With generative AI tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion becoming more accessible, your business might not need to look further. You can use such tools straight “off the shelf” through APIs with minimal setup. They are like plug-and-play devices, allowing for slight customization to fit specific needs. This can be done through prompt tuning and prefix learning to train the AI to recognize patterns or starters in your prompts Adapt: The transformative value, however, lies in adapting these models by training them on your organization’s own data, which could be customer interactions, specific industry language, or unique business processes. This approach involves a deeper level of customization, enabling your AI tool to perform complex tasks specific to your business. For instance, in a healthcare setting, AI can be adapted to understand medical terminology and patient data privacy standards, while in a retail context, it could be tailored to predict shopping trends based on the past behavior of your consumers. Each strategy has its pros and cons. For details, see the table below. Generative AI Adoption vs. Adaptation Aspect Adopt Adapt Limited scope for innovation with standard tools Involves lower upfront costs and quicker implementation but might lead to higher long-term expenses due to licensing fees or dependencies on external providers Companies need to be aware of potential risks associated with the data privacy and security of off-the-shelf solutions Usually requires basic operational training for employees. However, it doesn't demand significant changes in skill sets or organizational structure Enables the creation of unique, tailored AI applications Requires a larger initial investment, particularly in data curation and model training, but can offer more cost-effective solutions in the long run due to customization and scalability Can require substantial investment in upskilling employees and may lead to new roles and team structures within the organization Complete control over data usage and privacy, but there's an added layer of responsibility to safeguard sensitive information, requiring robust data governance and security measures Many companies initially use generative AI directly through its APIs to address specific, often isolated tasks without integrating them into their broader strategic framework. Deep technical expertise is not required in this approach Adapting AI involves a strategic integration where the technology becomes a core part of the business process Integration Skills Data Privacy & Security Costs Competitive Edge T o sum it up , adopting a generative AI model as is mig h t su ff ice f or an en h ancement or augmentation initiative .
