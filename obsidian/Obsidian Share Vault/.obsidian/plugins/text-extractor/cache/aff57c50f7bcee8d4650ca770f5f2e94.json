Less engaged voters were more pessimistic about the state of the economy and direction of the country, and were more likely to vote for Trump in the 2024 election. Among those who said politics was “not at all important” to their personal identity, three in four rated the state of the U.S. economy negatively (net -55; 20 percent positive – 75 percent negative) and two in three indicated the country is headed in the wrong direction (net -50; 18 percent right direction – 68 percent wrong direction). Similarly, among those who voted in the 2024 election but did not vote in the 2020 election, 19 percent of the 2024 electorate, 76 percent rated the national economy negatively (net -54; 22 percent positive – 76 percent negative). These less engaged and new voters were more likely to vote for Trump in 2024, with 2020 non-voters voting for Trump by a 12-point margin (net -12; 42 percent Harris – 54 percent Trump), and those who said politics is either “not that important” or “not at all important” to their personal identities voting for Trump by 3-point and 6-point margins, respectively (not at all important; 44 percent Harris – 47 percent Trump, not that important; 45 percent Harris – 51 percent Trump). Exit Poll: Vote History & Political Engagement While Harris was able to gain signi\u0000cant ground with less engaged voters, the group ultimately went for Trump. 12/16/24, 8:33 P M 2024 P ost-E lection S urvey: E ngagement and V ote History A nalysis chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/14 Among voters who said politics is not important to their personal identity (33 percent of overall electorate), a majority were women (58 percent women – 42 percent men), a majority rarely or never watched cable news (52 percent), and one in \u0000ve were swing voters in the 2024 election (19 percent).

Across political engagement, voters were unfavorable to Donald Trump going into the 2024 election, including 60 percent of voters who said politics is “not at all important” to their identity (net -22; 38 percent favorable – 60 percent unfavorable), though among the same group of disengaged voters, a plurality approved of Trump’s handling of the presidency (net +3; 49 percent approve – 46 percent disapprove). Among voters who said politics is not important to their identity, 49 percent listed in\u0000ation and the cost of living as a top issue affecting how they would vote in the 2024 election, followed by jobs and the economy (33 percent), and immigration (29 percent). Among this group, two in three disapproved of Biden’s handling of the economy (66 percent disapprove – 30 percent approve) and saw the state of the national economy as more of a reason to support Trump than Harris (net -19; 35 percent more of a reason to support Harris – 54 percent more of a reason to support Trump). Across engagement, In\u0000ation and the cost of living was the top issue among disengaged voters, as two in three disapproved of Biden’s handling of the economy. 12/16/24, 8:33 P M 2024 P ost-E lection S urvey: E ngagement and V ote History A nalysis chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 5/14 the level of in\u0000ation was also seen as more of a reason to support Trump, including among 2020 non-voters by a 20-point margin (35 percent more of a reason to support Harris – 55 percent more of a reason to support Trump).  2020 non-voters disapproved of Biden’s handling of the economy by a 39- point margin (28 percent approve – 67 percent disapprove) and rated him unfavorably by 33 points (32 percent favorable – 65 percent unfavorable).

Of that 5,000, 4,784 respondents were veri\u0000ed against a voter \u0000le (and the other 216 were voters who said they were registering before voting if interviewed before Election Day) and special care was taken to ensure the demographic composition of the sample re\u0000ected that of the expected 2024 electorate. The vote shares for Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, House and Senate Democrats, and House and Senate Republicans were also adjusted to re\u0000ect a preliminary estimate of the vote in the 2024 election. The margin of error for the full sample at the 95 percent level of con\u0000dence is +/- 1.4 percentage points. The margin of error for subgroups varies and is higher.    About The Study Get it directly in your inbox when new polls are released. Like the info here?
