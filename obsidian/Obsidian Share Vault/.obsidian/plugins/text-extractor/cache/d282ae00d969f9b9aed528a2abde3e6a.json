By Nathaniel Rakich MAR. 10, 2023, AT 6:00 AM Let’s give a big round of applause to the pollsters. Measuring public opinion is, in many ways, harder than ever — and yet, the polling industry just had one of its most successful election cycles in U.S. history.

Of course, some pollsters were more accurate than others. And today, we’ve updated the FiveThirtyEight pollster ratings to account for each pollster’s performance in the 2022 cycle. Our ratings are letter grades that we assign to each pollster based on historical accuracy and transparency. (You can read exactly how we calculate pollster ratings here.) They’re one of many tools you should use when deciding how much stock to place in a poll. Before we reveal the best- and worst-rated pollsters, let’s start with our regular review of polling accuracy overall. We analyzed virtually all polls conducted in the final 21 days before every presidential, U.S. Senate, U.S. House and gubernatorial general election, and every presidential primary, since 1998, using three lenses — error, “calls” and statistical bias — to conclude that 2022 was a banner year for polling.

For example, if a poll gave the Democratic candidate a lead of 2 percentage points, but the Republican won the election by 1 point, that poll had a 3-point error. As we’ve written many times, some degree of polling error is normal. Taken altogether, the polls in our pollster-ratings database have a weighted-average error of 6.0 points since 1998. However, polling in the 2021-22 election cycle had a weighted-average error of just 4.8 points, edging out the 2003-04 cycle for the lowest polling error on record.

SOURCES: POLLS, STATE ELECTION OFFICIALS Interestingly, the weighted-average errors of Senate and gubernatorial races were only slightly lower than usual last year. Polling of the 2021-22 cycle mostly owes its success to a low error in House races. This past cycle was the first time since the 1999-2000 cycle that House polls were more accurate than Senate and gubernatorial polls. RECOMMENDED But this isn’t as impressive as it sounds. The “House polls” group includes district-level polls of individual House races and national generic- congressional-ballot polls. And something we noticed early on in 2022 was that pollsters were conducting more generic-ballot polls and fewer district- level polls. Overall, since 1998, 21 percent of the House polls in our POLITICS The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump Read Now 12/17/24, 12:26 A M The Polls Were Historically A ccurate In 2022 | FiveThirtyE ight https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/ 4/15 pollster-ratings database have been generic-ballot polls — but in 2021-22, 46 percent were. That’s higher than in any other election cycle. And generic-ballot polls are historically much more accurate than district- level polls. Since 1998, generic-ballot polls have had a weighted-average error of 3.9 points, while district-level polls have had a weighted-average error of 6.7. So, by eschewing district polls in favor of generic-ballot polls last year, pollsters made their jobs much easier. But that’s not the only reason House polls were more accurate in this past cycle. The few district-level polls conducted had a weighted-average error of only 5.0 points — the lowest of any cycle since at least 1998. The second lens we use to gauge polling accuracy is how often polls “called” the election correctly. In other words, did the candidate who led a poll win their race? Historically, across all elections analyzed since 1998, polling leaders come out on top 78 percent of the time (again using a weighted average). By this metric, the 2021-22 cycle was the least accurate in recent history.

Polls are weighted by one over the square root of the number of polls that their pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. *Based on the poll’s median field date. SOURCES: POLLS, STATE ELECTION OFFICIALS But that low hit rate doesn’t really bother us. Correct calls are a lousy way to measure polling accuracy. Suppose two pollsters released surveys of a race that Democrats eventually won by 1 point. One of the pollsters showed the Republican winning by 1 point; the other showed the Democrat winning by 15 points. The latter pollster may have picked the correct winner, but its poll was wildly off the mark. So we’d be very wary of trusting it in a future election. The other pollster may have picked the wrong winner, but it was well within an acceptable margin of error; essentially, it just got unlucky. And you will not be surprised to learn that polls have a worse chance of “calling” the election correctly if they show a close race. In fact, the percentage of correct calls made is simply a function of how close the polls are. To quote, uh, myself from almost three years ago, “Polls’ true utility isn’t in telling us who will win, but rather in roughly how close a 12/17/24, 12:26 A M The Polls Were Historically A ccurate In 2022 | FiveThirtyE ight https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/ 6/15 Share of polls that correctly identified the winner in the final 21 days* before presidential primary and presidential, Senate, House and gubernatorial general elections since 1998, by how close the poll showed the race POLL MARGIN % PICKING WINNER 55% 3-6 69 6-10 86 10-15 93 15-20 97 ≥ 20 99 Includes polls of special elections and runoffs.

SOURCES: POLLS, STATE ELECTION OFFICIALS race is — and, therefore, how confident we should be in the outcome.” Historically, candidates leading polls by at least 20 points have won 99 percent of the time. But candidates leading polls by less than 3 points have won just 55 percent of the time. In other words, races within 3 points in the polls are little better than toss-ups — something we’ve been shouting from the rooftops for years. So for 2022, the only substantive lesson we can glean from this metric is that polls were historically close — something we already knew! In fact, 55 percent of the polls we analyzed for last cycle were closer than 6 points. That’s a higher share than in any other cycle since at least 1998. Finally, statistical bias is the third lens through which we view polling accuracy. While error tells us how much a poll missed, bias tells us in what direction it missed. In other words, did it overestimate Democrats or Republicans? There’s been a lot of interest in statistical bias in recent years — specifically, whether polls are systematically biased against Republicans nowadays. These concerns stem primarily from polls overestimating Democratic support in the 2016 and 2020 cycles; as the table below shows, the polls in 2015-16 had a weighted-average bias of D+3.0, and the polls in 2019-20 had an even worse weighted-average bias of D+4.7.

But that assumption was wrong: For 2021-22, polls had a weighted-average bias of just D+0.8.

SOURCES: POLLS, STATE ELECTION OFFICIALS Ironically, after the election, a narrative emerged that 2022 polling was actually too good for Republicans — a claim that our data doesn’t bear out, either. While the polls in a few closely watched races — like Arizona’s 12/17/24, 12:26 A M The Polls Were Historically A ccurate In 2022 | FiveThirtyE ight https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/ 8/15 governorship and Pennsylvania’s Senate seat — were biased toward Republicans, the polls overall still had a bit of a bias toward Democrats. That’s because generic-ballot polls, the most common type of poll last cycle, had a weighted-average bias of D+1.9, and polls of several less closely watched races, like the governorships in Ohio and Florida, also skewed toward Democrats. It was a weird year in that some states zigged and other states zagged; usually, polling bias in a given year is correlated from race to race. But if you’re trying to find patterns in polling bias from year to year … good luck. Statistical bias tends to bounce around from cycle to cycle. Sure, the polls had overestimated Democrats in three of the past four elections before 2022. But before that, in 2012, they overestimated Republicans. And there was barely any polling bias in the three cycles before that. This is why we’re constantly warning people against trying to predict the direction of polling error in advance. In fact, we’ve noticed that when pundits try to predict polling bias, they have a knack for guessing wrong. See, pollsters aren’t passive actors in all this. Pollsters are well aware when their polls have a bad year. Many adjust their methodology to avoid making the same mistakes. Simply put, if polling is broken, pollsters don’t just sit on their hands; they try to fix it! Up to this point, we’ve been talking about “the polls” and “pollsters” as if they were a monolith. But there are important differences in quality between pollsters. So, without further ado, here is how each pollster performed in the 2021-22 election cycle according to our three metrics: The most and least accurate pollsters of 2021-22 Average error, share of elections “called” correctly and average statistical bias of each pollster’s polls in the final 21 days* before Senate, House and gubernatorial general elections in the 2021-22 cycle, for pollsters that conducted at least five such polls 9 10 11 12 13 12/17/24, 12:26 A M The Polls Were Historically A ccurate In 2022 | FiveThirtyE ight https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/ 9/15 POLLSTER # OF POLLS AVERAGE ERROR % OF CORRECT CALLS AVERAGE BIAS Suffolk University 6 1.9 83% R+0.7 The New York Times/Siena College 12 1.9 88 EVEN Alaska Survey Research 5 2.2 100 R+1.9 SurveyUSA 12 2.4 100 EVEN Echelon Insights 8 2.4 63 R+1.2 Beacon Research/Shaw & Co.

SOURCES: POLLS, STATE ELECTION OFFICIALS Unsurprisingly, the top of the list is generally populated by academic and media-affiliated pollsters that have been trusted names in polling for a long time. But special congratulations are due to Suffolk University and The New York Times/Siena College, which had the lowest average errors of any pollster that conducted at least five qualifying polls last cycle. As a result, Suffolk’s pollster rating has increased from B+ to A-. The New York Times/Siena College already had an A+ grade, so it didn’t get a ratings boost. Still, its stellar performance did push it past Selzer & Co. for the distinction of most accurate pollster in America (at least by FiveThirtyEight’s reckoning). Meanwhile, the bottom of the list features quite a few Republican- affiliated pollsters that systematically overestimated the GOP in 2022: RRH Elections, InsiderAdvantage, co/efficient, Moore Information Group. But the most famous of these is probably Trafalgar Group, a pollster whose methods are notoriously opaque but that played a significant role in shaping the ultimately untrue narrative that a “red wave” was building with its 37 (!) qualifying pre-election polls. Trafalgar’s polls were quite accurate in 2020, when its Republican-leaning house effects helped it avoid the big polling miss that other firms experienced. As a result, it went into 2022 with an A- pollster rating. But its poor performance last cycle has knocked it down to a B — making it one of two pollsters to fall two notches in our ratings this year. 14 15 12/17/24, 12:26 A M The Polls Were Historically A ccurate In 2022 | FiveThirtyE ight https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/ 11/15 Of course, we generate more data on each pollster than just a letter grade. On our pollster-ratings page, you’ll also find the pollster’s historical bias, the number of its polls we’ve analyzed and its Predictive Plus-Minus, which is our projection of how much error we think the pollster will have in future elections relative to the average pollster. (Negative scores mean we believe the pollster will have less error than average.) On each pollster’s individual pollster-ratings page, you’ll find the percentage of races it called correctly, the most recent cycle in which it polled, a list of all its qualifying polls and how accurate they were as well as whether it participates in the American Association for Public Opinion Research’s Transparency Initiative or shares its data with the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. (A note for close observers of the pollster ratings: We have stopped giving pollsters credit for once belonging to the now-defunct National Council on Public Polls.) That final datum is essential because that level of transparency correlates with methodological quality and accuracy. And if all that isn’t enough, you can also download the data underlying our pollster ratings for even more goodies, like how often a pollster missed outside the margin of error, its house effects and how much we penalize it for potential herding. Have fun exploring, and if you have any questions, email us at polls@fivethirtyeight.com. CORRECTION (March 13, 12:18 p.m.): A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Trafalgar Group was the only pollster that fell two notches in FiveThirtyEight’s pollster ratings; TIPP Insights also saw its rating decline by two steps, from A+ to A-.

We also excluded primary polls if their leader or runner-up dropped out before that primary was held, if any candidate receiving at least 15 12/17/24, 12:26 A M The Polls Were Historically A ccurate In 2022 | FiveThirtyE ight https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/ 12/15 percent in the poll dropped out or if any combination of candidates receiving at least 25 percent in the poll dropped out. Finally, pollsters that are banned by FiveThirtyEight for unethical behavior (such as fabricating data) are excluded from all calculations. 3. To avoid giving individual pollsters too much influence if they happened to conduct a lot of polls, polls are weighted by one over the square root of the number of polls that their pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. For instance, if Danielle Steel Polling Inc. conducted 16 gubernatorial polls in 2021-22 and George R.R. Martin University conducted one, each poll from Danielle Steel would be given one-fourth the weight of the poll from George R.R. Martin. 4. Specifically, 4.80. 5. 4.82. 6. That said, generic-ballot polls had a built-in disadvantage in 2022. Generic-ballot polls ask respondents across the nation which party they plan to vote for in Congress. But not everyone can vote for their preferred party: Sometimes, a party doesn’t have a candidate in a given district. Last year, Democrats left significantly more seats uncontested than Republicans did, which probably cost Democrats about 1 point of margin in the national popular vote. In other words, even if generic-ballot polls were perfectly accurate in measuring national public opinion, they would have slightly missed the national popular vote. Despite this, generic-ballot polls in 2022 were quite accurate, with a weighted-average error of only 3.1 points. 7. We gave a poll half-credit on this score if it showed a tied race and one of the leading candidates won. 8. Only 33 percent of polls were closer than 6 points in 2007-08. That cycle had the highest weighted-average correct-call percentage on record: 88 percent. 9. Which had a weighted-average bias of R+3.7. 10. R+4.2. 11. Though, as explained in the sixth footnote of this article, we would expect perfectly accurate generic-ballot polls to have a bias of about D+1 when compared to the national popular vote. 12. Which had a weighted-average bias of D+5.1. 13. D+9.2. 14. But it’s worth noting that the two pollsters with the highest errors, Amber Integrated and Ascend Action, both strongly overestimated Democrats. What happened there? Amber and Ascend are Oklahoma-based pollsters (the latter is partially based in Kentucky as well), and Oklahoma’s 2022 elections featured huge polling errors in the GOP’s favor. For example, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt led by less than 5 points in FiveThirtyEight’s final polling average of the gubernatorial race, but he won by almost 14 points. 15. Excluding changes in provisional grades, which we give to pollsters that don’t have a large enough sample size of polls to assign a full grade to.
