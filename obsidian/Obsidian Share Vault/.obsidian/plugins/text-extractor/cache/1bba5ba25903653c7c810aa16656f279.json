Email: joe.nyangon@sas.com Edited by: John Byrne, Associate Editor and Peter Lund, Editor-in-Chief Abstract Electricity price forecasting is crucial for grid management, renewable energy integration, power system planning, and price volatility management. However, poor accuracy due to complex generation mix data and hetero- skedasticity poses a challenge for utilities and grid operators. This paper evalu- ates advanced analytics methods that utilize principal component analysis (PCA) to improve forecasting accuracy amidst heteroskedastic noise. Drawing on the experience of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), a leading producer of renewable electricity, the study analyzes hourly electricity prices and demand data from 2016 to 2021 to assess the impact of day-ahead forecasting on California's evolving generation mix. To enhance data quality, traditional outlier analysis using the interquartile range (IQR) method is first applied, followed by a novel supervised PCA technique called robust PCA (RPCA) for more effective outlier detection and elimination. The combined approach significantly improves data symmetry and reduces skewness. Multi- ple linear regression models are then constructed to forecast electricity prices using both raw and transformed features obtained through PCA. Results dem- onstrate that the model utilizing transformed features, after outlier removal using the traditional method and SAS Sparse Matrix method, achieves the highest forecasting performance. Notably, the SAS Sparse Matrix outlier removal method, implemented via proc RPCA, greatly contributes to improved model accuracy. This study highlights that PCA methods enhance electricity price forecasting accuracy, facilitating the integration of renewables like solar and wind, thereby aiding grid management and promoting renewable growth in day-ahead markets.

The inherent complexities of the electricity market, characterized by its high volatility, nonlinearity, high frequency, mean reversion, and non-stationarity, make accurate forecasting a challenge. To navigate these complexities, experts employ advanced analytics such as extreme learning machine (ELM), kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM), bivari- ate empirical mode decomposition (BED), and principal component analysis (PCA). For instance, Chen et al. (2012) employed ELM alongside bootstrapping for price forecasting in the Australian National Electricity Market, and Alhassan et al. (2020) used PCA combined with wavelet and kernel support vector regression methods to forecast finan- cial time series data. Yang et al. (2017) combined wavelet transform, ARMA, and KELM methods for enhanced accu- racy in their predictions. Hong and Wu (2012) introduced a hybrid method for day-ahead locational marginal price (LMP) forecasting in the PJM energy market, utilizing a PCA neural network cascaded with a multi-layer feed-forward (MLF) neural networks. On the other hand, Wang et al. (2019) designed a model that combined a hybrid feature selec- tor, Gray Correlation Analysis (GCA), Kernel function with PCA (KPCA) for feature extraction, and a differential evolu- tion (DE) based Support Vector Machine (SVM) for price classification. Similarly, Wu et al. (2021) aimed to reduce time complexity in England's energy market by implementing GCA for sample and feature selection, while He et al. (2015) proposed a BED-based forecasting methodology for tracking and predicting uncertain electricity price movements. As grid management becomes increasingly intricate due to evolving operational and management needs, these advanced forecasting techniques are indispensable. Their significance is heightened by the challenges arising from the hetero- skedasticity and high dimensionality of generation mix data. A review of literature has shown that analyzing price fluctuations is crucial for identifying uncertain behaviors in electricity price movements. Specifically, two primary behaviors in day-ahead markets (DAM) are noted: asymmetry and price-elasticity (Duan, 2016; Fan, 2016; Sadeghi-Mobarakeh et al., 2017). Negative prices in the California DAM have garnered attention. For instance, Woo et al. (2016) linked renewable energy's merit-order effect to price divergence in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) DAM and real-time markets. Filho et al. (2017) proposed a hybrid approach using decision trees and artificial neural networks to shed light on the effects of negative LMPs on the grid. Furthermore, Byrne et al. (2018) aimed to maximize energy storage revenue in the CAISO market by formulating an optimization strategy that accounts for negative LMPs caused by increased renewable generation. Despite the rise and irregular distribution of negative pricing, it offers insights into renewable energy investments, transmission and storage development, and load growth opportunities in specific electricity markets. Seel et al. (2021) noted that by 2020, low natural gas prices and increased renewable energy integration in California had already depressed wholesale prices. The COVID-19 pandemic, by reducing electricity demand, intensified this trend, leading to negative prices in about 4% of all hours across US wholesale market nodes, with varying distribution across regional electricity markets. Although some government incentives for renewable energy development, like investment tax credit (ITC) and pro- duction tax credit (PTC), might cause price volatility, maintaining a stable and competitive market remains the goal. Various studies have examined price fluctuations to bolster the capabilities of modern smart grid electricity markets (Dai et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2018; K. Wang et al., 2019). Li et al. (2018) analyzed intra-day data from the PJM Intercon- nection electricity system, including over 11,000 transmission lines, highlighting spike prices as significant contributors to market fluctuations. Meanwhile, Lu et al. (2018) introduced a dynamic pricing demand response algorithm using reinforcement learning to manage energy adaptively in a hierarchical electricity market. These studies indicate that when PCA is combined with advanced analytics, it can substantially support operations of smart grid electricity markets. This enhancement includes accurate price forecasting, volatility reduction, stream- lined energy demand management, and optimal consumption pattern adjustments. Specifically, this paper focusses on the efficacy of PCA in enhancing forecasting accuracy within the CAISO energy markets by reducing heteroskedastic noises.

The paper delves into CAISO's resource adequacy planning, underlining how technological innovation, renewable energy integration, and regulatory policy decisions can impact generation mix changes (Byrne et al., 2015, 2022; Nyangon & Byrne, 2023; Woo et al., 2016). This research seeks to enlighten policymakers and market operators about the value of unsupervised methods like PCA, especially in forecasting day- ahead prices in an environment increasingly dominated by renewable energy sources. The paper is organized as fol- lows: Section 2 details the literature and study's motivation; Sections 3 and 4 cover research methodology and data; Section 5 discusses the findings, and Section 6 provides conclusions. 1.1 | Research questions This work aims to answer the following research questions. 1. Do advanced outlier and noise removal strategies perform better than traditional methods in achieving better predic- tion of electricity prices? 2. Can we compare the performance of PCA transformed features with raw features in predicting electricity prices? a. Do transformed features generated by SAS PCA implementation perform better than raw features for predicting electricity prices? b. Do transformed features generated by SAS PCA implementation perform better than those generated by Python's PCA implementation for predicting electricity prices? 2 | LITERATURE R EVIEW A ND CONTRIBUTIONS This section covers the literature review of three interrelated research topics: forecasting electricity prices, integration of renewable energy in CAISO'S DAM, and the application of PCA-to manage price fluctuations in predominantly renewable electricity markets. This review is instrumental in underpinning the foundations of our research and highlighting our contributions. 2.1 | Electricity price forecasting Reliable electricity price forecasting is vital for market participants to establish effective risk management plans. The lit- erature categorizes electricity price forecasting into five thematic areas: (i) statistical time series analysis, (ii) machine learning and data-driven techniques, (iii) econometric models and market fundamentals, (iv) hybrid and ensemble models, and (v) behavioral finance and market sentiment analysis. Each methodology has its merits and limitations, contingent upon the specific objectives of the forecasting task. For instance, statistical time series analysis leverages models like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (Yang et al., 2017), autoregressive (AR) or autoregressive-exogenous ARX(n, m) models (Nowotarski & Weron, 2016), dynamic regression, or Generalized Auto- Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)-based models (Fan, 2016; Hong & Wu, 2012), exponential smooth- ing (Forootan et al., 2022), and vector autoregression (VAR) (Alhassan et al., 2020) to analyze and understand electricity prices' statistical behavior. In contrast, machine learning techniques rely on algorithms and data-driven approaches like PCA, ANN, SVM, decision trees, and random forests to make predictions based on historical data (Bose, 2017; Nikkhah et al., 2019). Econometric models focus on economic factors impacting electricity prices like multi-agent or game theoretic simula- tions, to analyze relationships between variables that influence electricity prices, such as weather, fuel prices, and demand (Ali & Choi, 2020; Nyangon & Byrne, 2023). Hybrid models combine multiple methods, such as statistical models and machine learning algorithms, for greater accuracy, while behavioral finance and market sentiment analysis emphasize human behavior's impact on pricing, to forecast price movements or develop counteractive measures. Of these approaches, statistical time series analysis and machine learning methods have proven most effective in forecast- ing electricity prices (He et al., 2015; Hong & Wu, 2012; Yang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018), hence their focus in this paper.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Recent research demonstrates that machine learning models accounting for multiple sources of exogenous variation (Vivas et al., 2020), relevance vector machine (RVM) (Meng et al., 2009), deep learning models (Lago et al., 2018), semi- parametric models (2008), and a combination of machine learning methods, neural networks, and random forests (Spiliotis et al., 2021), have superior forecasting accuracy compared to traditional statistical models. Despite both having efficacy, machine learning techniques may offer improved precision. 2.2 | Renewable energy integration Integrating renewable energy into CAISO's day-ahead electricity market presents five main primary challenges. These include (i) grid integration and operational complications due to intermittency and variability concerns, (ii) regulatory and market design issues to enable large-scale integration of renewable electricity, fair competition and appropriate pricing signals, (iii) forecasting and data management obstacles, and (iv) significant investment in transmission lines and energy storage infrastructure needed. Moreover, (v) socio-political resistance in the form of opposition from local communities and political stakeholders can hamper renewable energy policy and facility development. Previous studies by Martinot (2016), Price (2016), Abido et al. (2022), and Shaker et al. (2016) emphasize the necessity for flexible power generation, energy storage, and decentralized energy resources to improve grid integration. For successful renewable energy integration in California's energy markets, investments in long- duration energy storage systems (LDES) (Rinaldi et al., 2021), interconnection with the Western Interconnect (Voisin et al., 2020; Woo et al., 2017), and accurate forecasting are essential. Studies have also delved into the contribution of California's renew- able energy portfolio standards and their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions reduction and resource utilization (Daneshi, 2018), the active curtailment of intermittent generation resources to maximize hosting capacity in the CAISO energy markets (Kahrobaee et al., 2019). the cost of renewable integration and the implications of negative electricity pricing (Ginsberg et al., 2018). Moreover, Fan (2016) identified strong asymmetric correlations in the California electric- ity spot price market in 2000, which had significant implication on the market's collapse. Duan (2016) introduced a scheduling model using price-elastic demand bidding to lower the demand-to-average demand ratio. Sadeghi- Mobarakeh et al. (2017) employed a random forest model to forecast CAISO's DAM prices and determined the optimal relationships among electricity price variables such as low, medium, and high. Additionally, Woo et al. (2017) examined the efficacy of California's cap-and-trade program in internalizing CO2 emission costs, identifying some limitations related to inter-regional trading of wholesale electricity. Lastly, Uniejewski et al. (2019) applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach to select variables and provide recommendations for forecasting very short-term electricity prices, while Nowotarski and Weron (2016) considered long-term seasonal component in day-ahead markets to improve accuracy of electricity price forecasts. Cumulatively, these studies underline a unified message: the effective integration of renewable energy into CAISO's day-ahead electricity market requires a blend of technical, market, and regulatory innovations. These innovations should directly tackle the challenges arising from the intermittent and variable nature of renewable energy, constraints in distribution hosting capacity, congested interconnection pathways, and the compensation mechanisms for investor-owned utilities as California's Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) expands its customer base. Central to this transition are next-generation energy storage solutions, accurate forecasting methods, and measures to enhance grid flexibility. By introducing avant-garde market productsâsuch as flexible ramping, LDES, demand response, dis- tributed energy resources (DERs), and smart grid technologiesâwe can fundamentally transform grid planning, and facilitate smoother integration of large-scale wind and solar energies. 2.3 | PCA-driven enhancements in renewable energy integration Due to the above motivations, California's journey toward renewable energy integration has witnessed significant refinements over the past decades. One key methodological approach that has emerged is the application of PCA to reduce data dimensionality and uncover inherent patterns and correlations. van Triel and Lipman (2020) illustrated that tools like V2G-SIM, SWITCH, and GridSim can augment the predictive accuracy of the effects of electric vehicle (EV) charging demands on the intermittent renewable resource integration in California. Their studies project a poten- tial enhancement of up to 60% by 2030, potentially translating to capital savings of roughly US $20 billion in stationary storage technology investments. Liu et al. (2020) employed sophisticated PCA techniques to extract spatio-temporal 4of23 NYANGON and AKINTUNDE 2041840x, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wene.504 by Joe Nyangon , Wiley Online Library on [21/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License features of renewable energy, laying the foundation for a predictive model for renewable energy generation. Sreedharan et al. (2016) highlighted the importance of innovative incentive mechanisms to spur DERs in bolstering renewable inte- gration services, particularly for commercial and industrial sectors across California. Ginsberg et al. (2018) introduced a framework to assess the costs associated with variable renewable energy integration, taking San Diego Gas and Electric (SDGE) as a case study, offering valuable insights for stakeholders beyond California. Relatedly, Hopwood et al. (2020) showcased that PCA, when applied to currentâvoltage (IV) traces, could enhance failure classification accuracy by producing uncorrelated variables, ultimately reducing dimensionality and refining interpretability. Nikkhah et al. (2019) combined PCA with artificial neural networks (ANN) for forecasting energy flows in agricultural contexts. Their methodology effectively reduced the data dimensions from six to two, demonstrating the approach's prowess in minimizing data intricacy and overlap. Talaat et al. (2019) put forth a dynamic model controlling a hybrid system that amalgamates wave, solar, and wind energies, boosting the efficiency of renewable energy systems. Lastly, Vishnupriyan and Manoharan (2018) employed an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to achieve optimal electric power system planning through multi-criteria decision analysis, determining an optimal tilt grid-connected PV system as the prime configuration for their study region. Together, these investigations underscore PCA's transformative role in advancing renewable energy integration, that is, by improving forecasting accuracy, reduce data dimensionality and collinearity, and optimizing and improving renewable energy integration in the CAISO energy markets. Notably, the integration of simulation methodologies and the development of novel incentive structures for DERs can increase their value and improve their grid integration. By utilizing PCA in renewable energy forecasting models, we can better tailor and optimize our renewable energy strate- gies. Such studies encapsulate the ongoing commitment of the research community to refine renewable energy integra- tion in California continually. 2.4 | Motivation and contributions While innovative measures, including LDES, improved forecasting accuracy, and grid adaptability, can profoundly transform renewable energy integration within CAISO's day-ahead electricity market, the field still lacks a holistic modeling framework that comprehensively addresses the effects of variability and intermittency. Introducing novel market products, such as flexible ramping, load following, demand response, DERs, and investments in smart grid technologies, holds potential to improve grid planning processes and seamlessly incorporate large-scale wind and solar power into the sys- tem. Central to overcoming these hurdles is the ability to accurately forecast renewable energy generation, thereby optimiz- ing the synergy between energy storage and generation systems. An impactful approach to improve forecasting accuracy lies in harnessing advanced analytics to distill principal components (PCs), which capture the primary data variation sources. By doing so, predictions can be enhanced, especially amidst challenges like heteroskedastic noise. This research makes several noteworthy contributions: (a) emphasis on advanced analyticsâit underscores the role of cutting-edge analytics in improving forecasting accuracy for highly integrated renewable energy markets. (b) Role of PCAâby illuminating the utility of PCA in identifying the core variation sources within day-ahead price forecast data, this paper provides invaluable insights that can guide the optimization of energy storage and generation frameworks. (c) Addressing noise challengesâit offers an in-depth examination of the intricacies introduced by heteroskedastic noise, elucidating how sophisticated analytics can mitigate these issues. The insights gleaned from this study are indis- pensable for policymakers, energy enterprises, and other vested parties aiming to elevate renewable energy integration and augment energy system efficacy. In essence, this paper not only spotlights enhancements in renewable energy inte- gration and forecasting accuracy but also showcases the capabilities of advanced analytical techniques in surmounting challenges inherent to renewable energy's unpredictable nature. Such knowledge is pivotal in shaping energy policies and systems that champion the optimal use of renewable assets. 3 | PRELIMINAR IES AND METHODOLOG Y This section provides an introduction to the theoretical concepts and algorithms that will be either used or modified later in the paper. Following a preliminary, the day-ahead price forecasting and net-load analysis are discussed, with multiple methods, tools, and approaches being used depending on the captured parameters as well as the goal of the energy forecasting scenario. NYANGON and AKINTUNDE 5of23 2041840x, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wene.504 by Joe Nyangon , Wiley Online Library on [21/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 3.1 | Day-ahead price forecasting On April 1, 2009, CAISO rolled out its Market Redesign and Technology Upgrade (MRTU) system, a three-tiered pro- cess for the day-ahead market. The sequence starts with the market power mitigation test, progresses to the integrated forward market, and culminates in the residual unit commitment process. This final step identifies the necessary power plants for the subsequent day, ensuring they are primed for electricity generation. Within CAISO, market participants are known as Scheduling Coordinators (SCs). They act as the bridge between the ISO, electricity generators, retailers, and end-users. Market prices emerge from the bids placed by these authorized SCs. Integral to the MRTU system are three load aggregation points (LAPs), representing the service areas of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDGE). These LAP prices reflect the load-weighted average of all the LMPs within their respective LAP territories. A comprehensive network model is instrumental to the market, meticulously examining the active transmission and generation assets to pinpoint the most cost-effective energy to fulfill demand. This model produces prices that shed light on the expenses associated with generating and transporting energy from distinct nodes. SCs have the privilege to conduct transactions in the day-ahead market. This market welcomes bids and scheduling a week in advance of the trading day and unveils the results by 1:00 p.m. the preceding day. Energy imbalances arise when there is a mismatch between day-ahead forecasts and real-time market operations. Specifically, while the day-ahead market schedules energy in hourly segments, the real-time market operates in shorter 15- and 5-min intervals. These discrepancies primarily arise due to the real-time market's need to adjust power delivery on-the-fly within an hour. The day-ahead market's inability to predict net load with complete accuracy also introduces variances. As a result, any disparity between forecasted day-ahead energy and actual consumption translates to energy imbalances. 3.2 | Net load analysis Net load analysis is a popular method leveraged for predicting the exchange of load between various grids such as trans- formers, feeders, substations, sensors, and potentially customers. However, the biggest challenge lies in defining the long-term value of this process and its outcomes. The calculation of net load is achieved by finding the difference between electricity demand and the supply that comes from different sources of renewable energy. The expected renew- able energy supply is a sum of all the energy generated from the individual renewable energy generators in the system. This calculated parameter forms the basis of the net load, which is represented by different levels of aggregation such as separating the supply from each generator or aggregating all generator time series. Modeling approaches like neural networks, regression, and support vector machines account for these essential attributes and effects. Furthermore, accu- rate electric load forecasting models should also consider factors like seasonal trends, external influences like tempera- ture and day of the week, as well as any connections between defined variables. There can also be improvements to models through refinement or better inputs, such as better temperature and load data. However, net load analysis does have its drawbacks as the âcopperplateâ model does not account for transmission or operational parameters like eco- nomic dispatch models, interconnectivity to neighbors, or stability metrics such as frequency and voltage response (Emmanuel et al., 2020). Nonetheless, it is still a vital component for exploring possible scenarios related to future gen- eration mixes and various sources of flexibility, thus informing both capacity expansion, unit commitment, and eco- nomic dispatch models. 3.3 | PCA methodology PCA is a widely used technique in multivariate statistical inference. From a mathematical standpoint, PCA is used to trans- form a series of related variables into uncorrelated new variables of the same number. This is accomplished by identifying which variables contribute the most to the total variability of the original vector of random variables, denoted as x.The covariance matrix, which is defined as the expected value of the product of xi and xj, represents the relationships among the variables and is not a zero vector (Hong & Wu, 2012;Lietal., 2018;Naderietal., 2023; Rastogi et al., 2021). By finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, we can determine which PCs (Hopwood et al., 2020; Nikkhah et al., 2019) account for the largest variances and subsequently explain most of the total variability of the vector. 6of23 NYANGON and AKINTUNDE 2041840x, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wene.504 by Joe Nyangon , Wiley Online Library on [21/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License The properties of PCs are numerous and noteworthy. Specifically, each PC is a linear combination of the original variables (Lago et al., 2021), with the first PC accounting for the maximum variance in the data (Jones, 2001;Li et al., 2018). This maximum variance is equal to the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. As we move forward in identifying subsequent PCs, we account for the remaining maximum variance that has not been accounted for by the previous PCs. Furthermore, each PC is uncorrelated with any other PC. Hence, we only need to select those PCs with larger values of variance for PCA use. PCA is often used for studies involving large data sizes, as it can effectively reduce the dimensionality of multivari- ate analysis (Alhassan et al., 2020; Hopwood et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019). This reduction in dimensionality is achieved by replacing a number of variables with a smaller number of PCs that effectively summarize a previously large part of the variation of the data. Additionally, PCA is generally beneficial for studies requiring the discovery of latent common structures of factors and the interpretation of the structural meaning of each PC. Numerous studies have applied PCA to research questions in electricity markets and relevant areas (Hopwood et al., 2020;Ji et al., 2017;Liet al., 2018;Liu et al., 2020;K.Wangetal., 2019). For example, PCA has been employed to investi- gate the dynamics of implied price volatility and capture long- and short-term fluctuations of the volatility term structure for the stock index. Overall, PCA is an efficient and reliable tool for studies concerning electricity mar- kets and beyond. 3.4 | CAISO market system, exploratory analysis, and covariates 3.4.1 | CAISO market system Headquartered in Folsom, CAISO is a non-profit entity that oversees California's high voltage grid. Its management extends across three primary domains within the California markets: ancillary services (Abiodun et al., 2023), real-time imbalance energy (Price, 2016), and transmission congestion management (Emmanuel et al., 2020; Seel et al., 2021). Additionally, CAISO was the first market in the world to procure ancillary services through competitive bidding. The California markets source four kinds of ancillary services: regulating reserves, spinning reserves, non-spinning reserves, and replacement reserves. These market-based mechanisms were out in a comprehensive survey of the US ancillary ser- vices markets by Zhou et al. (2016). Pollitt and Anaya (2020) examined the rising reliance on electricity markets for ancillary services procurement, especially given the increased demand from intermittent renewable generation. Ehnberg et al. (2019) delved into a techno-economic categorization of ancillary services from a service provider's angle, shedding light on emerging opportunities and competitive landscapes. Post-clearance of the California Power Exchange (California PX) forward energy market, whether day-ahead or hour-ahead, bids for any combination of the four reserve ancillary services are submitted together. The sequence for clearing the ancillary services market is from the âhigher qualityâ to âlower qualityâ services (Sreedharan et al., 2016). Notably, the California PX also operates as an SC, feeding into the forward energy markets. CAISO manages long-term reliability-must-run (RMR) contract, which requires power plants to operate during the term of the agreement, and dis- patches the RMR units (Joseph, 2022). The necessity for RMR units on the ISO-controlled grid is dictated by localized reliability requirements framed by geographical considerations. However, the day-ahead and hour-ahead energy mar- kets are steered by the California PX, not CAISO (Weron & Misiorek, 2008). Moreover, CAISO addresses transmission congestion that arises when the forward schedules, submitted by SCs to the ISO, risk overloading transmission lines. In such scenarios, the full batch of schedules for that hour is termed âinfeasibleâ (Seel et al., 2021). CAISO then mitigates this congestion by modifying schedules to ensure they are âfeasi- ble.â To manage congestion in forward markets, CAISO leverages adjustment bids, which accompany the day-ahead and hour-ahead energy schedules. 3.4.2 | Exploratory analysis and covariates Our study offers an initial exploration of electricity prices and demand between 2016 to 2021. We identify significant periods of price hikes and drops and correlate them with real-life events associated with those periods. Table 1 shows the summary of the electricity price for 24 h each day and approximately 365 days each year. There are exactly 52,441 observations.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License The data provided in Figure 1,1aâ6a detail the daily electricity prices in cents/kWh for the years 2016 and 2021, while Figure 1,1bâ6b display the corresponding price distributions. The high electricity price spikes seen from 2017 through 2021 could be as a result of social economic events, outliers or noise. Figure 1,2aâ6a shows that sudden high electricity spikes of over 200 cents/kWh were seen between June and November of 2017, between July and August of 2018, in February 2019, between August and October of 2020, February 2021 and between June and November of 2021. Figures 2 and 3 show that these spikes in prices were not necessarily due to a rise in electricity demand and there could be other reasons for the spike. We conducted a correlation analysis for years 2019 and 2021. After removing the outliers using the Sparse Matrix method as described in Section 4.1.2, we found a low positive correlation between price and demand in 2019 (rho = 0.296) and a moderate positive correlation in 2021 (rho = 0.512). This indicates that demand alone does not determine electricity prices, but prices depend on other factors as well. Wildfires in California have significant economic and regulatory effects on utility companies. They are one of the reasons for the high electricity prices and the bankruptcy of utility companies in recent years because wildfires destroy electricity transmission lines, prompting utilities to rebuild or upgrade infrastructure to avoid future fires. This has resulted in increased electricity rates for consumers. For example, PG&E filed for bankruptcy in 2018 as a result of lia- bilities caused by wildfires, incurring an anticipated cost of over $30 billion (Hay & Chhabra, 2020). This generated pro- posals for state intervention to deter similar bankruptcy filings by other utilities. Indirect losses account for the majority of the economic impact, with Wang et al. (2021) estimating that the economic damage caused by California wildfires was approximately 1.5% of the state's annual gross domestic product. Devising strategies and policies to reduce the chances of future fires and to equip utilities to handle emergencies more effectively is essential. For example, Malloy (2023) found that liability regulations have encouraged utility companies to increase their precautionary measures when operating power lines. Wong-Parodi (2020) studied the unintended health impacts of PG&E's public safety power shutoffs (PSPS), intended to mitigate the risk of wildfires.

With the PROC RPCA action set, the data matrix MM is decomposed into a low-rank matrix LL and a sparse matrix SS. The low-rank matrix LL is utilized to extract the ârobustâ PCs, while the sparse matrix SS contains the outliers or erroneous data points (Salis et al., 2018). This decomposition is achieved by solving the following optimization problem: minimize \u0001 \u0001 \u0001L \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0003Ã¾Î»\u0001 \u0001 \u0001S\u0001 \u0001 \u00011: subject to MM Â¼ LL Ã¾ SS: kLk* is defined as the nuclear form of matrix L, kSk1 is the l1 norm of matrix S and Î» is defined by the formula below where n is the number of observations in M (Salis et al., 2018): Î» Â¼ 1=ân: SAS RPCA is designed to address the scenario where the input matrix MM has a true low rank but is contaminated by outliers or noise. Leveraging this assumption, PROC RPCA effectively cleans the data by removing outliers. FIGURE 4 Boxplot of hourly electricity prices from 2016 to 2021, including outliers.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License To identify anomalies, we utilized the sparse matrix generated through this process. By identifying significant values within the sparse matrix, we were able to pinpoint the corresponding outliers in the original data. Our RPCA analysis focused on daily prices of each day of the year (DOY feature) to detect unusual observations. To achieve this, we employed the SAS RPCA action set with the anomaly detection option set to âtrue,â as described by the documentation in SAS Institute (2023). The variable DOY was selected as the x variable, while electricity prices served as the Y variable. In a previous study by Hong et al. in 2012, they used features such as âweekday,ââyesterday's price,â and âlocal demandâ for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. We experimented with these features alongside the DOY feature and found that DOY yielded visually superior results in terms of detecting anomalies. The resulting data table, named sparsemat2, as illustrated in SAS Institute (2023) in the CAS engine library, con- tains both zero and nonzero values. The nonzero values within the sparse matrix correspond to outlier values intro- duced in the price variable. When applying the SAS Sparse Matrix strategy for outlier removal, we excluded these nonzero values. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate boxplots after outlier removal employing SAS' Sparse Matrix strategy and a combination of both the traditional strategy and SAS' Sparse Matrix strategy, respectively. 4.1.3 | Data selection and processing: Skewness and kurtosis of raw data before and after outlier removal Skewness values greater than 1 or less than \u00011 indicate a highly skewed distribution, while values between 0.5 and 1or \u00010.5 and \u00011 suggest moderate skewness. A value between \u00010.5 and 0.5 indicates a fairly symmetrical distribution. Figures 8 and 9 depict the skewness and kurtosis of the raw data before outlier removal. These figures show that outlier FIGURE 6 Boxplot after outlier removal using SAS' Sparse Matrix strategy.

Figures 10 and 11 show a tremendous improve- ment to the skewness and kurtosis values respectively after outlier removal. The traditional method effectively improved the symmetry of the distribution, while the SAS Outlier removal method successfully reduced skewness to desirable levels of less than 1, particularly in the case of year 2021 where it outperformed the traditional method. Combining both outlier removal strategies further enhanced the skewness values, leading to even greater improvements. In the context of kurtosis, a widely accepted criterion suggests that a value above +1 indicates a highly peaked distribution, while a value below \u00011 suggests a distribution that is excessively flat. Distributions that exhibit skew- ness and/or kurtosis exceeding these guidelines are considered non-normal. Interestingly, the traditional method demonstrated superior performance over the SAS outlier removal method in achieving a desirable peaked distribution. However, Figure 11 reveals that employing a combination of strategies did not lead to an improvement in kurtosis. FIGURE 8 Skewness data distribution prior to outlier removal.

Details of these models are captured in Table 2. We partitioned the data from 2016 to 2021 into distinct training and test subsets. It is important to note that for all models, except the first one in Table 2, outliers were removed before partitioning the data into training and test sets. 5.2 | PCA experiment set up PCA is a widely-used technique for reducing matrix dimensionality. In contrast, RPCA first decomposes the data matrix into two parts: a low-rank matrix (capturing ânormalâ variables) and a sparse matrix (capturing âoutlierâ variables).

This was followed by the use of the linear regression function from the âsklearn.linear_model.â We focused on the initial five PCA-transformed Python features for predictions. Given the lack of a robust RPCA imple- mentation in Python during our study, we did not generate RPCA features through Python. TABLE 2 Results showing the performance of the 13 models.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License For the SAS-based models, we utilized âPROC PCAâ for PCA and âPROC RPCAâ for RPCA to generate PCs. Subse- quently, we utilized the SAS linear regression function, âPROC REGSELECT.â We explored up to five SAS PCA- transformed features, using the leading five for predictions. Only four SAS RPCA-transformed features were produced and used. When handling SAS models with datasets cleansed of outliers through the sparse matrix method, we strictly applied PCA, RPCA, and linear regression on the dataset's normal portion. Notably, for models 9 and 13, outliers were already removed through the sparse matrix method before the RPCA step. This led to a double RPCA outlier removal, which could explain the elevated RMSE for these models when compared to models 8 and 12. As posited by Hodge and Austin (2004), repetitive outlier removal may inadvertently strip out data sections that signify typical behavior. 5.3 | Results Figures 12 and 13 show the root mean square errors (RMSE) for the training and test datasets, respectively. Table 2 pre- sents both the R-squaredâa measure of the model's goodness of fitâand the RMSE for each model. From Table 2 and the aforementioned figures (Figures 12 and 13), it is evident that Model 10 stands out. This model, a linear regression one using RAW features, underwent outlier removal via both traditional and SAS Sparse Matrix methods. It showed superior performance on the training set. Such an outcome hints at the efficacy of the SAS Sparse Matrix outlier removal method, implemented through proc RPCA, especially when compared to Model 2 which only used the tradi- tional outlier removal technique. On the test set, Model 12, which employed SAS PCA post-outlier removal (using both traditional and SAS Sparse Matrix techniques), achieved the highest performance. However, it is noteworthy that Models 3, 7, and 11, which uti- lized Python PCA, displayed tendencies of overfitting. This was evident as their training RMSE consistently out- performed their test RMSE. While PCA, as highlighted by Liu and Gillies (2016), is often leveraged to avert overfitting due to its dimensionality-reducing properties, our findings suggest that the models transformed using Python's PCA were susceptible to overfitting. Ilin and Raiko (2010) posited that traditional PCAs can face overfitting issues due to missing values. Even though we omitted rows with absent features, this very omission might inadvertently have spurred overfitting in the Python PCA models. 5.4 | Discussion In our analysis of the CAISO energy markets, we found that integrating outlier removal methods with feature transfor- mations substantially enhances the accuracy of day-ahead electricity price forecasting models. CAISO oversees the high voltage grid in California and manages various energy markets, notably the day-ahead market. In this market, prices FIGURE 12 RMSE on training data.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License are set based on bids from SCs. The day-ahead market in CAISO comprises several steps: market power mitigation tests, integrated forward markets, and residual unit commitment processes. Factors such as SC bids, load-weighted average prices (LAPs) at specific aggregation points, and the readiness of power plants determined by the residual unit commit- ment process all influence market prices. However, forecasting day-ahead electricity prices accurately poses challenges. Discrepancies between day-ahead and real-time market schedules, coupled with uncertainties in the day-ahead net load forecast, can lead to prediction errors and energy imbalances. To improve forecasting accuracy amid these challenges, many turn to net load analysis, which predicts the load exchange between different grids. This method accounts for the disparity between electricity demand and renewable energy supply. Although it does not effectively capture all transmission or operational parameters, it is instrumental in visualizing changing generation mix scenarios and flexibility sources. These insights subsequently guide capacity expan- sion, unit commitment, and economic dispatch models. For enhancing day-ahead price forecasting models, outlier removal is pivotal. In this study, we employed the SAS' Sparse Matrix method to detect and remove outliers. By filtering out extreme data points, we can mitigate the effects of noise or erroneous data on forecasting. Furthermore, we can harness feature transformations, like PCA, to refine the input variables of our forecasting model. PCA is a widely used technique for reducing the dimensionality of multivari- ate dataset by identifying the key variables causing most variation. Through eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covari- ance matrix, PCA determines the PCs responsible for most data variances. By using fewer PCs that capture the majority of data variability, we can decrease input dimensions yet retain pertinent information. Given its efficacy, PCA is exten- sively utilized in electricity market studies to gauge implied price volatility and discern short- and long-term fluctua- tions. This tool not only aids in analyzing electricity market trends but also elevates day-ahead price forecasting models by revealing significant data patterns. Looking at the CAISO market's day-ahead electricity price data from 2016 to 2021, we observed notable price fluctu- ations. Implementing PCA on this data helped in capturing the underlying patterns and structures, thereby improving the model's predictive accuracy. Correlating these price shifts with real-world events, such as California wildfires and regulatory changes, can help in understanding the driving factors behind price variations. Wildfires in California have posed significant economic and regulatory challenges for utilities, triggering soaring electricity prices and even bank- ruptcies. The ramifications of these fires on electricity transmission, coupled with the cost of infrastructure upgrades, have contributed to increased electricity hikes for consumers. Hence, it is vital to formulate strategies that mitigate wildfire risks and better equip utilities for emergencies. By combining outlier removal techniques like the Sparse Matrix method with feature transformations (e.g., PCA), we can improve day-ahead electricity price forecasting accuracy for the CAISO energy markets. Removing outliers ensures the removal of extreme price variances caused by external events or data noise, offering a more accurate repre- sentation of inherent price trends. Meanwhile, feature transformations, such as PCA, help identify critical variables and reveal hidden data patterns. This combined approach augments forecasting model efficacy, ensuring more accurate pre- dictions and supporting the integration of higher levels of renewable energy sources.

Advanced outlier removal methods outperform traditional techniques. By leveraging PCA to reduce the impact of heteroskedastic noise, the study demonstrates the potential of this technique to enhance forecasting accuracy in the intricate and ever-changing CAISO electricity market. Notably, the results emphasize the rising importance of techno- logical innovations and the integration of renewable energy in highly renewable energy markets like CAISO. They also address challenges stemming from shifts in the generation mix, regulatory environment, and the integration of variable renewable energy sources (Acemoglu et al., 2017; Fox-Penner, 2020; Nyangon, 2021a; Nyangon & Byrne, 2018). By com- bining outlier removal methods, PCA-based feature transformations, and supervised learning techniques, they can enhance forecasting accuracy by minimizing heteroskedastic noise. This gives utilities and regulators the tools to make informed decisions and refine strategies in the rapidly changing energy sector.Asthe CAISOenergymarkets further integrate higher levels of variable renewable energy sources like solar PV and wind power, advanced fore- casting methods are vital for grid stability, energy balance management, and optimal renewable resource utilization. This study offers invaluable insights for policymakers, utility professionals, and grid managers overseeing electricity market operations. Embedding PCA and additional supervised learning methodologies into forecasting models bolsters the speed and accuracy of day-ahead energy price forecasts. This enhancement can support decision-making, resource strategizing, and risk mitigation, especially in markets that are transitioning to more variable renewable energy capacity (Hou et al., 2019; Nyangon, 2021b; Nyangon et al., 2017; Nyangon & Byrne, 2021; Shomali & Pinkse, 2016; Yuan et al., 2019). The research also underscores the shortcomings of sole reliance on net load analysis, emphasizing the need to factor in external influences such as wildfires, seasonal patterns, and temperature fluctuations in electricity price forecasting models. Additionally, it advocates for a holistic approach that incorporates transmission and operational parameters, system interconnectivity, and stability metrics to improve forecasting models. Finally, the study emphasizes the ongoing need for advancements in forecasting tools and methods, especially as the CAISO energy markets seek to seamlessly integrate renewable energy resources. By harnessing these advanced techniques, CAISO stakeholders can deepen their grasp on electricity pricing, optimize resources, and ensure smooth renewable energy integration. Collectively, these initiatives can drive more sustainable and efficient electricity market operations.
