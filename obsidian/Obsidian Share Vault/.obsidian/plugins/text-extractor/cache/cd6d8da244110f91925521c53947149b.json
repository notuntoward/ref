The NEM spans Australia’s eastern and south-eastern coasts and comprises of five interconnected states that also act as price regions: Queensland, New South Wales ( including the Australian Capital Territory) , South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania. Western Australia and the Northern Territory are not connected to the NEM, primarily due to the distance between networks. The NEM’s transmission network carries power from electricity generators to large industrial energy users and local electricity distributors across the five regions. These assets are owned and operated by state governments, or private businesses. The NEM commenced operation as a wholesale spot market for electricity in December 1 9 9 8 . The NEM incorporates around 4 0 ,0 0 0 km of transmission lines and cables. The NEM supplies about 2 0 4 terawatt hours of electricity to businesses and households each year. $1 1 .5 billion was traded in the NEM in FY 2 0 2 0 -2 1 . The NEM supplies approximately 1 0 .7 million customers. The NEM has a total electricity generating capacity of 6 5 ,2 5 2 MW ( as at December 2 0 2 1 ) . The NEM has approximately 1 4 GW of distributed solar ( as at Dec 2 0 2 1 ) . Collectively the largest generator in the NEM. The National Electricity Market ( NEM) operates on one of the world’s longest interconnected power systems, stretching from Port Douglas in Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia and across the Bass Strait to Tasmania – a distance of around 5 ,0 0 0 kilometres.

At current rates of development, there could be sufficient renewable resources available to meet 1 0 0 % of underlying consumer demand in certain periods by 2 0 2 5 . Here are the generation resources that make up our NEM today. To understand the NEM, it’s necessary to understand the journey that electricity takes as it travels from generators to customers, and the technology and infrastructure that makes this possible. When an electrical appliance is switched on, power is instantly transmitted from a power station to the appliance. Although this occurs instantaneously, a specific sequence of events takes place to ensure the required electricity is delivered, as illustrated below: 1 4 .6 4 TWh 0 .1 8 TWh Energy resources The electricity network 3 .8 5 % 6 4 .6 7 % 6 .5 7 % 7 .0 9 % 1 0 .4 5 % 0 .0 5 % 7 .2 1 % 0 .0 9 % Transport of electricity FACT SHEET: THE NATIONAL ELECTRICITY MARKET Coal Grid- scale Solar Annual generation by fuel type ( 2 0 2 0 /2 1 ) Gas Distributed PV Wind Battery Energy Storage Systems Hydro Biomass 1 .

Rooftop sol ar PV and batteri es Can provide electricity to the grid The NEM is a wholesale commodity exchange for electricity across the five interconnected states. Electricity cannot be stored easily, so the electricity market works as a “pool”, or spot market, where power supply and demand is matched instantaneously through a centrally coordinated dispatch process. Generators offer to supply the market with specified amounts of electricity at specified prices for set time periods and can re-submit the offered amounts at any time. From all the bids offered, the Australian Energy Market Operator ( AEMO) decides which generators will be deployed to produce electricity, with the cheapest generator put into operation first. NEM operation is designed to meet electricity demand ( or consumption) in the most cost-efficient way. Electricity production is matched to electricity consumption, and spare generating capacity is always kept in reserve in case it’s needed. The current energy price can then be calculated. Electricity production is also subject to transmission limitations so that the network is not overloaded. To deliver electricity, a dispatch price is determined every five minutes. Commencing 1 October 2 0 2 1 , Five-Minute Settlement ( 5 MS) shifted the 3 0 -minute wholesale electricity spot market settlement period to five minutes, providing a better price signal for investment in faster response technologies, such as batteries and gas peaking generators. The National Electricity Rules ( the Rules) set a maximum spot price, also known as the Maximum Price Cap. From 1 July 2 0 2 0 , this cap is set at $1 5 ,0 0 0 per megawatt hour, and is adjusted annually for inflation. To manage price volatility, retailers and generators often enter into hedging contracts to fix the price for future electricity sale. The price of electricity in the NEM is based on: 1 . Offers by generator to supply electricity to the market at particular volumes and prices at set times. 2 . Demand at any given time. All electricity sales are traded through the NEM. It is a wholesale market and prices fluctuate in response to supply and demand at any point in time. The Rules also set a minimum spot price, called the market floor price. The market floor price is -$1 ,0 0 0 per megawatt hour. The Australian Energy Market Commission’s Reliability Panel reviews the market price cap and market floor price settings every four years to ensure they align with the NEM reliability standard. Parallel with the increase in the number of rooftop solar panel systems installed on Australian dwellings, occurrences of negative spot prices in the NEM have become more prevalent. When spot prices are negative, generators pay to generate electricity and consumers get paid to consume electricity. To pay generators, AEMO must recover costs from customers. Most customers don’t participate directly in the NEM, so they purchase their electricity through a retailer. Customers pay the retailers a commercial tariff, and retailers manage customers’ energy purchases, including paying AEMO the spot price to avert the risk of system collapse or physical damage to parts of the power system. NEM participants need to manage the financial risks associated with the significant spot price volatility that occurs during trading periods. They achieve this by using financial contracts that lock in a firm price for electricity that will be produced or consumed at a given time in the future. These arrangements are generally in the form of derivatives, and include swaps or hedges, options and futures contracts. The NEM is a wholesale electricity market in which generators sell electricity and retailers buy it to on-sell to consumers. There are over 1 0 0 generators and retailers participating in the market, so it’s highly competitive and therefore an efficient way of maintaining relatively competitive electricity prices in the wholesale market. How the NEM works FACT SHEET: THE NATIONAL ELECTRICITY MARKET The spot market Fluctuating prices NEM market price Financial market price Watt ( W) Kilowatt ( KW) Gigawatt ( GW) Megawatt ( MW) A kilowatt-hour is the amount of electricity produced or consumed in an hour. A typical Australian home’s daily usage is around 1 7 kWh. 1 WATT 1 MILLION WATTS 1 0 0 0 WATTS 1 0 0 0 MILLION WATTS AEMO is responsible for monitoring electricity consumption and the flow of energy across the power system. If there are system limitations or increases in consumption, AEMO adjusts and, if supplies are inadequate to meet consumption, AEMO may issue notices to the market for additional generation or directly intervene as a last resort. AEMO also monitors electricity voltage and frequency to make sure the system stays secure. It monitors the impact of planned power outages to make sure the system can accommodate any subsequent loss of generation or transmission capacity. AEMO controls the NEM via two identical control centres in different states. Each can seamlessly assume responsibility for the entire NEM if needed. The output of a power station is described in megawatts Gigawatts are used to describe large amounts of electricity The output of rooftop solar panels is often described in kilowatts Often seen on packaging for small household products such as light bulbs A 4 0 W bulb uses 4 0 watts of electricity Maximum demand for NSW in 2 0 1 9 /2 0 was 1 3 .8 GW. The Tesla Battery at Hornsdale, South Australia, can produce 1 0 0 MW of electricity. A typical residential solar panel system can produce 3 .5 KW of electricity. Should consumption in a NEM region exceed supply, and all other means of meeting that consumption have been exhausted, AEMO can contract Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trading ( RERT) providers for additional supply, and as a last resort to protect power system security. AEMO can instruct network service providers to temporarily load shed electricity supply to some consumers to avert the risk of system collapse or physical damage to parts of the power system. This action is only taken when there is an urgent need to protect the power system by reducing consumption and returning supply and demand in the system to balance. AEMO also operates the retail electricity markets across the NEM. These markets underpin the wholesale market by facilitating retail competition and enabling all customers to purchase energy from the supplier of their choice.
