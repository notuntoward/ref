Traditional methods for creating candi- date profiles predominantly rely on questionnaire responses, a time-intensive and costly process. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-centric methodology utilizing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), culminating in creating political avatars. These political avatars are engineered using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 and Bard. They are adept at pro- cessing and interpreting data primarily sourced from Twitter and leveraging bespoke, self-trained datasets. Integrating advanced AI technology with diverse data sources equips political avatars with unprecedented analytical and predictive capabilities, setting a new standard in political analysis. Unlike traditional methods, political avatars are adept at emulating the responses of real politicians or experts, showcasing a remarkable capacity to interact with VAA sur- veys. This novel approach presents the potential to either compete with or enhance the insights traditionally obtained from human experts. Another critical aspect of our study is comparing political avatars and previous research employing question-answering (QA) models based on advanced natural language processing (NLP) tech- niques for political profiling. This comparative analysis reveals that Political Avatars offer a significantly more robust solution for pro- file construction. While QA models provide structured responses based on specific queries, political avatars bring an element of dy- namism and depth, capable of generating nuanced, context-aware responses. This shift from static, questionnaire-based profiling to dynamic, AI-driven avatars marks a substantial leap in political analysis. Generative AI in crafting Political Avatars introduces a transformative element to data analysis. This approach facilitates a layered and more sophisticated interpretation of political stances, moving beyond the limitations of traditional profiling methods.

These applications are designed to enhance the user’s understanding of political parties in a straightforward and user-friendly manner, thereby boosting their interest in politics. Switzerland, with its unique political landscape characterized by frequent voting due to its direct democracy system, serves as the focal point of this study. Swiss citizens often rely on VAAs to inform their opinions before voting. Established in 2003, smartvote is a leading VAA in Switzerland, managed by Politools, a politically impartial and non-profit organi- zation. It has significantly influenced over 200 local, cantonal, and national elections. Smartvote operates through an election-specific questionnaire covering a wide range of political topics, allowing voters to assess and compare their political positions with those of 305 DGO 2024, June 11–14, 2024, Taipei, Taiwan Mancera and Terán various candidates or parties. Consequently, it provides tailored vot- ing recommendations. Political scientists meticulously crafted this questionnaire. When politicians have not personally constructed their profile, political scientists develop it on their behalf. This work aims to facilitate the role of political scientists by proposing the development of Political Avatars (PA) that can also respond to Voter Advice Applications (VAAs) surveys. We can summarize our contributions as follows: (1) We introduce the political avatars approach within the do- main of generative AI (GenAI) for developing political avatars and measure the efficacy of these virtual agents in respond- ing to VAA questions. The evaluation is based solely on data gathered from Twitter and further involves a comparative analysis with the comprehensive data that the large language model (LLM) possesses regarding a politician. (2) A performance quantitative analysis between political avatars and QA Models developed by Nigon, Mancera, and Terán (2023) [36]. This work is structured as follows: Section 2 related works and impacts of VAAs. presents the theoretical background of this research effort. The problem definition, framework context, and GenAI method developed and applied in the execution of this work are presented in Section 3. The experiments and results for a QA Model as a baseline are presented in Section 4. Section 5 evaluates the new strategy using GenAI to create political avatars. Later, Sec- tion 6 discusses limitations, recommendations, and applicability for the models. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the work conducted and presents the lessons learned. 2 RELATED WORK The field spectrum involving recommender systems constantly extends into education and learning support, healthcare delivery, and tourism [32]. In addition, it is increasingly used in politics to promote democratic decision-making, improve citizens’ participa- tion, and revitalize civic engagement using cutting-edge technology. Well-known examples of recommender systems in politics are VAAs like the Swiss smartvote platform1. VAAs based on political profiling and matching algorithms provide suggestions to citizens regarding the best-matched vote intention [20]. Lately, the use and impacts of VAAs have drawn growing research interest in many countries [17, 27, 40]. In Switzerland, for instance, a significant and growing ratio of the electorate uses these applications in federal, cantonal, and local elections has drawn researchers’ interest [15, 33]. Con- cerning citizen participation, in several countries, including the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, and Switzerland, VAAs have al- ready evolved institutionalized tools. Although the investigation of VAAs applies primarily to a social and political perspective, the development and implementation of this type of application are also catching the attention of technical-oriented networks within the extent of their research areas. Communities connected to recom- mender systems, social computing, data mining, eDemocracy, and others are also attracting researchers with contributions relevant to VAA development [2–5, 13, 16, 24, 46, 47]. In recent years, research on the design, implementation, and application of VAAs has led many political and social scientists 1https://www.smartvote.ch/ to study such tools as a significant feature of the election cam- paign in different countries before national or regional elections [7, 18]. In [19], the authors describe the state-of-the-art VAA re- search conducted until 2014. Early studies show that VAAs research focused mainly on such platforms’ users [6, 8, 12, 45, 50]. The liter- ature shows the need for trans-disciplinary approaches to improve traditional VAA implementations to implement groundbreaking methods. 2.1 Impact of VAAs The impact of VAAs and the growing number of users require en- hancing transparency in developing questionnaires and policy state- ments towards establishing party positions on high-dimensional political landscapes [37, 48]. Moreover, it is essential to consider selecting a method for matching the profiles of parties/candidates with users that could impact user recommendations [30, 31]. In [19], the authors mention three types of effects that VAAs can have on users—individuals’ information-seeking behavior, cognitive effects, and vote choice—measured by quantitative (turnout) and qualita- tive (vote intention) methods. Research conducted on the impact of VAAs shows a correlation between the users of VAAs and electoral participation [9, 14, 22, 29, 34]. Moreover, there is proof that recom- mendations persuaded the users of different voting advice platforms they received in their voting intentions [8, 11, 26, 28, 35, 49]. Later on, [20] showed that the abundance of data generated by VAAs po- tentiates comparative studies of public opinion and party systems across countries, thereby bridging research on VAAs to general inquiries of political science research [43, 44]. Even though VAAs research applies more from a political and social point of view, the development and implementation of such applications are gaining the attention of technical-oriented net- works within the scope of their research fields. Communities re- lated to recommender systems, data mining, social computing, ar- gument mining, and eDemocracy, among others, are also attracting researchers with contributions related to VAAs developments [2– 5, 13, 16, 24, 46, 47]. Based on the impact and growing number of users of VAAs, higher levels of transparency were required to develop question- naires and policy statements to establish party positions on high- dimensional political maps [37, 48]. Additionally, it is essential to consider selecting a method for matching the profiles of par- ties/candidates with users that could impact user recommendations [30, 31]. In their work, [19] mention three types of effects that VAAs can have on users: individuals’ information-seeking behavior, cog- nitive effects, and vote choice, measured with quantitative (turnout) and qualitative (vote intention) methods. The conducted research re- garding the impact of VAAs shows a correlation between the uses of VAAs and electoral participation [9, 14, 22, 29, 34, 41]. Additionally, evidence was found that VAA users declared that the recommenda- tions that the different platforms provided influenced their voting intentions [1, 8, 11, 26, 28, 35, 39, 49]. Later on, [20] show the abun- dance of data generated by VAAs potentiates comparative studies of public opinion and party systems across countries and thereby bridges research on VAAs to general questions of political science research. 306 From GenAI to Political Profiling Avatars DGO 2024, June 11–14, 2024, Taipei, Taiwan 3 PROBLEM DEFINITION AND METHODOLOGY One of the most challenging steps towards the design of VAAs is the generation of candidates’ profiles, which are constructed either by using answers reported by the candidates themselves or by their political parties or by using the answers reported by experts (e.g., academics and journalists, among others). Depending on how the profiles are constructed, they can be biased from the candidates’ real political position and can thus mislead the citizens’ vote decision. This work uses politicians’ Twitter data to answer the VAA ques- tionnaire. Usually, when candidates do not have a profile, political experts will answer the questions for the candidate. However, this is tedious, and also, those experts are expensive. Additionally, politi- cians can be biased while answering the VAA questionnaire. This work can support political experts in analyzing the politician’s answers. In most VAA projects, the profile generation includes only can- didate answers and expert opinions. In [43], profile generation for VAAs includes static and dynamic components. Static elements are included to adjust policy statements (𝐼1, ..., 𝐼𝑛). Dynamic elements are composed of different types of parts, including context aware- ness (CA), user interaction (UI), privacy settings (PS), and sentiment analysis (SA). These elements are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Dynamic Profiles for VAAs, adapted from [43] The central assumption in creating dynamic candidate profiles is that most candidates are unwilling to answer the VAA ques- tionnaires [23] and that using expert opinions demands extensive preparation. The problem increases when the list of candidates that will be analyzed is considerably extensive, as well as the campaign’s duration. In certain elections, the list of candidates is completed a few days before the political campaigns start, and the campaigns’ duration varies from days to several months. For elections with a big list of candidates and short periods for the campaign, getting the answers from all candidates or using expert opinions to generate political profiles are highly challenging and sometimes impossible to implement. In [44], authors introduced so-called dynamic profiles using sen- timent analysis, and Twitter feeds from candidates. This approach uses candidates’ Twitter as an additional source and dynamic ele- ment. Furthermore, the work of [36] uses additional data sources (i.e., Twitter and YouTube) and applies QA models to generate dy- namic profiles. This work extends traditional static profile generation that comes from either the answers of candidates or expert opinions using a Figure 2: Dynamic Profiles for VAAs using Political Profile Avatars Delphi method. Additionally, it extends the works of [44] and [36] that use sentiment analysis and QA methods by adding a so-called political avatar as shown grey in Figure 2. In Figure 2, the four elements of a dynamic profile described above are presented. Each element of the dynamic profile is weighted (𝑤𝑖 ). Depending on the quality of the information provided by each element, it can be included and averaged to avoid biased results and capture political candidates’ opinions dynamically. It is impor- tant to mention that political opinion is not static and can vary and evolve [10]. This approach can capture when such changes are presented and how they impact voters’ opinions [42]. 3.1 Generative AI Models LLMs have been significantly enhanced through the integration of GenAI. These models have been trained with vast amounts of online information, which could help support the creation of sophisticated virtual experts. In addition, LLMs can fit specific needs via fine- tuning or prompting with additional data, thus tailoring them to have a certain expertise on specific topics or domains. For instance, an LLM can be enriched with diverse personal inputs, such as opinions on a subject, interviews, books, or documents authored by an individual. This process facilitates the creation of a specialized knowledge base reflective of the content generated by a person. These virtual experts can handle complex tasks such as responding to surveys, guiding a topic, or offering informed recommendations. Different studies have worked on this idea to create human vir- tual experts based on advanced techniques such as reinforcement learning with generative adversarial feedback (RLGAF) [51]. This innovative approach aligns the outputs of LLMs with human ex- pert demonstrations, enabling them to learn from valuable human input without direct exposure to specific training examples. This methodology indicates the potential for automating AI alignment, making LLMs more adaptable and effective in diverse applications, including VAAs [51]. For a more specific study on evaluating political information, we could find a study by Kuznetsova et al. [25] that assesses the proficiency of ChatGPT and Bing Chat in evaluating political infor- mation. This study found ChatGPT to be more accurate, with a 72 % accuracy rate compared to Bing Chat’s 67 %. It highlighted the variance in performance based on factors such as language, political communication concepts, and the context of the statements [25]. 307 DGO 2024, June 11–14, 2024, Taipei, Taiwan Mancera and Terán Nevertheless, this paper advances beyond merely analyzing gen- eral political information. It proposes the creation of a customized Virtual Political Expert capable of emulating the role of a politician or providing insights on specific topics. On Twitter and YouTube Data. In the context of our research, we utilize datasets from Twitter and YouTube related to Carlo Som- maruga2 to develop a specialized variant of an LLM. The adapted LLM integrates this additional information into its knowledge base. LLMs and Prompting. Typically, LLMs are stateless, meaning they do not retain memory of previous interactions. However, for this research, choosing LLMs capable of concatenating text between questions and answers via an API was important. The models se- lected for this study include: (1) GPT-4, developed by OpenAI. The LLM is known for its human-like text generation and understanding. It was trained on a diverse internet dataset; the last training month is April 2023 [38]. (2) Bard is Google’s LLM. It is based on Google’s pathways language model (PaLM). Bard was officially launched on March 21, 2023, [21]. The construction of this specialized knowledge base primarily utilizes prompting techniques to steer the model’s responses within the scope of its pre-existing training parameters. This method was chosen over fine-tuning, which requires significantly more compu- tational resources, especially given the moderate size of the Twit- ter and YouTube datasets involved. The data remains manageable within the constraints of the LLMs’ API capabilities for text con- catenation, which typically ranges between 50 and 60 prompts. Political Avatars with GenAI. Contrasting with QA models, eval- uating VAA surveys using GenAI considers fewer steps. The quality of input data requires careful consideration, including removing elements like emojis or URLs. However, widely used English, Ger- man, French, and Spanish translations are considered within the LLMs. This process is illustrated in Figure 3. Twitter Data Cleaning Avatar (GenAI Model) Answers Figure 3: GenAI process The code and datasets used are available in the following GitHub repository3. 4 QA MODELS EVALUATION For the first experiment, we select a Swiss politician, Carlo Som- maruga. He represents the canton of Geneva in the Council of States and is a member of the Socialist Party. This politician is chosen due to his active presence on Twitter, YouTube, and smartvote. As a first step, the questions and answers are extracted from Carlo Sommaruga’s smartvote profile. The code and dataset is available in the following GitHub repository4 as presented in [36]. 2Carlo Sommaruga is a Swiss lawyer and politician of the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland. He has been a National Councilor for over a decade, and since 2019, he has been a member of the Council of States. Source: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Carlo_Sommaruga 3https://github.com/jose0628/Generative-AI-to-Political-Profiling-Avatars- 4https://github.com/camille-sophiie/vaa-qa-models 4.1 Twitter Data The Twitter data from Carlo Sommaruga’s profile is fetched using the Tweepy Python library API. The data is cleaned and translated into English. As the QA model needs a question and a context to predict an answer, context vectors have been created using key- words. Tweets are then matched to different political topics [36]. The 60 questions of the smartvote questionnaire are extracted and simplified. The respective context vectors are then applied to the simplified questions. Table 1: Table defining Twitter results, adapted from [36] Actual Answers Negative Positive Predicted Answers Negative 2 1 Positive 2 16 Not Conclusive 17 22 The confusion matrix in Table 1 shows many unclassified tweets. However, the classified tweets are mainly rightly predicted. Addi- tionally, the output of the QA model also returns where the model extracts the text used to answer the question. 5 GENERATIVE AI MODELS EVALUATION The political avatar evaluation consists of two cases to answer the 60 smartvote questions. (1) Unknown Politician: The LLM focuses only on Tweets and YouTube information. (2) Know Politician: Besides the Tweets and YouTube infor- mation, the LLM knows the politician’s name. Additionally, we take advantage of the translation capabilities of LLMs and utilize them to receive the original questions from the smartvote survey as input. In this case, unlike with the QA models, we did not employ the simplified versions of the questions. 5.1 Prompting Questions After the model was supplied with the dataset information, the following prompting questions were systematically posed as a tem- plate for each case. (1) Unknown Politician: Utilizing only the information from transcripts and tweets, can you determine whether the fol- lowing statements are true (yes), false (no), or uncertain (not conclusive)? Please provide a brief explanation for each answer. (2) Know Politician: Considering the provided transcripts and tweets related to Carlo Sommaruga, in conjunction with your pre-existing knowledge base and current internet resources, and acknowledging that your task is to answer questions, can you accurately categorize the following statements as “true” (yes), “false” (no), or “uncertain” (not conclusive)? For each answer, please include a concise explanation to support your conclusion. 5.2 Prompting Answers The following answer examples are based on the 60 VAA survey used by Nigon, Mancera, and Terán (2023) [36] 308 From GenAI to Political Profiling Avatars DGO 2024, June 11–14, 2024, Taipei, Taiwan BARD Answers. Bard’s answers are more binary, with “Yes” or “No” as the answer choice. It also rephrases the answer using ele- ments of the question. (1) Question: Should vaccines be compulsory? Answer: Com- pulsory vaccines: Yes (2) Question: Should undocumented migrants receive a status? Answer: Undocumented migrants: No (3) Question: Do you support stricter control of equal pay for men and women? Answer: Stricter control of equal pay for men and women: Yes (4) Question: Should we support renewable energies? Answer: Support renewable energies: Yes GPT-4 Answers. The responses provided by the GPT-4 model exhibit a broader range of nuances. They avoid binary answers and offer responses along a spectrum, such as “Yes,” “Likely Yes,” and so forth. Additionally, the model incorporates essential insights into the underlying reasons for its answers, particularly concerning political topics and the context. (1) Question: Should vaccines be compulsory? Answer: Com- pulsory vaccines: likely yes (2) Question: Should undocumented migrants receive a status? Answer: Likely yes or yes, based on humanitarian concerns. (3) Question: Do you support stricter control of equal pay for men and women? Answer: Likely yes, based on gender equality principles. (4) Question: Should we support renewable energies? Answer: Likely yes, based on environmental sustainability. 5.3 Bard - Case: Unknown Politician The Table 2 indicates a marginal enhancement in positive outcomes compared to both QA models. However, the limitation of basing predictions solely on the Twitter dataset persists, leading to a con- sistent trend of high numbers in non-conclusive answers. Table 2: Table Bard - Unknown Politician results Actual Answers Negative Positive Predicted Answers Negative 1 2 Positive 4 1 Not Conclusive 18 34 5.4 GPT-4 - Case: Unknown Politician In the Table 3, GPT-4 demonstrates an increase in accurate predic- tions for the Positive category, likely due to its specialized language comprehension capabilities, especially regarding the more complex original questions, compared to Bard. This observation highlights GPT-4’s ability to handle higher complexity, although it still pro- duces many non-conclusive answers. 5.5 Bard - Case: Know Politician The Table 4 illustrates that when Bard is aware of the politician’s name (Carlo Sommaruga), it responds to every smartvote question, reducing the count of Not Conclusive responses to zero. This re- sults in a significant increase in both true positives and negatives. Table 3: Table GPT-4 - Unknown Politician results Actual Answers Negative Positive Predicted Answers Negative 1 6 Positive 24 2 Not Conclusive 14 13 Notably, the answers to the prompts suggest that Bard’s responses begin to incorporate information about this politician beyond the information of the Twitter dataset. It also appears to consider addi- tional sources like articles, news, and interviews, which are likely part of the data Bard was trained on. Table 4: Table Bard - Know Politician results Actual Answers Negative Positive Predicted Answers Negative 9 12 Positive 33 6 Not Conclusive 0 0 5.6 GPT-4 - Case: Know Politician The Table 5 demonstrates that GPT-4 has better prediction capabil- ities than Bard. Remarkably, GPT-4 outperforms Bard by correctly answering more questions. It suggests that GPT-4’s knowledge base is more comprehensive than Bard’s, and it may possess enhanced linguistic skills, potentially enabling it to forge connections across various pieces of information more effectively. Table 5: Table Bard - Know Politician results Actual Answers Negative Positive Predicted Answers Negative 11 10 Positive 37 2 Not Conclusive 0 0 6 DISCUSSION 6.1 GenAI Models vs QA Models Based on a survey of 60 questions and an analysis of a Twitter dataset, it was observed that GenAI models demonstrated slight improvements in their responses when comparing the QA model- based case on Twitter (refer to Table 1) with scenarios involving Bard and GPT-4, particularly when the politician’s identity was not previously known to the LLMs. This indicates that QA Models can be an effective initial approach for generating insights when creating a profile based solely on social media data from static datasets. However, when Bard and GPT-4 are familiar with the politician’s name, their performance significantly surpasses expectations. In these cases, the models leverage the specific datasets provided (e.g., the politician’s tweets) and draw upon a broader knowledge base that includes news, articles, books, and more. These models benefit 309 DGO 2024, June 11–14, 2024, Taipei, Taiwan Mancera and Terán from extensive training sets, enabling them to identify information relationships and contextualize their responses. Yet, at this stage, LLMs still function as “black boxes,” making it challenging to verify the accuracy and unbiased nature of the information they have been trained on. Consequently, we position these models as an additional dimension rather than a primary element for profiling politicians within our dynamic profiles framework (as shown in Figure 2). 6.2 GenAI Models Limitations. LLMs such as Bard and GPT-4 encounter contextual understanding and memory limitations, notably capped at around 60 historical prompts at the API level. This constraint limits their ability to acquire profound insights in complex fields like politics, where information is considerable. Moreover, these models are significantly limited by their training data, and fine-tuning them demands high computational resources. Additionally, there are no- table concerns regarding bias and ethics, particularly in politically charged contexts where cultural, gender, and social biases may be more pronounced. As for accuracy, these models are not infalli- ble and are prone to errors, a critical factor to consider in their application and reliance. Recommendations. LLMs serve as powerful instruments, ideally empowering users seeking to explore political viewpoints or opin- ions using available internet data about specific political topics or candidates. However, it is crucial to inform users about the potential for errors in this technology. From our observations, providing high-quality data is essential to enhance the accuracy of predictions. These models are better suited as tools to assist experts rather than replace them. Politics is a complex domain, and such tools are valuable for navigating the vast array of correct and incorrect information about candidates and political propositions. While relying on the outputs of these systems is beneficial, it is always prudent to conduct thorough research before making voting decisions. The use of LLMs should be approached as part of a broader, more comprehensive decision- making process. Applicability. Utilizing LLMs as political avatars represents one of many potential use cases or applications. These models can be adapted across various domains that rely on expert knowledge. It has been demonstrated that, with the appropriate input, LLMs can yield meaningful results and recommendations. LLMs extend beyond simple question-answering about specific topics. They are also valuable for data transformation, providing rapid access to learning new subjects and serving as experts in niche areas. This versatility could be particularly transformative in fields like education or where expert advice is not readily available, offer- ing guidance and insights. Such applications highlight the broad utility of LLMs in augmenting human expertise and facilitating knowledge acquisition. 7 CONCLUSION This study introduces an innovative method to improve dynamic profiles for VAAs by employing Generative AI and creating political avatars. We evaluate the effectiveness of these avatars in compari- son to previously developed QA models that incorporate advanced NLP technologies within the political domain. Our approach utilizes LLMs to develop political avatars capable of participating in VAA surveys. This method shows promise in enhancing or even surpass- ing the insights provided by human experts. Our findings indicate that with precise information on politicians, LLMs can notably increase response accuracy and decrease the rate of inconclusive answers. However, the effectiveness of Political Avatars is limited by the scope of their training data and their ability to interpret complex po- litical contexts accurately. Future endeavors should aim to broaden and diversify the training datasets for these avatars, enhance their grasp of intricate political discussions, and tackle ethical issues such as bias and the spread of misinformation. In summary, this research significantly advances the integration of GenAI and LLM technologies into politics. Investigating GenAI models paves the way for innovations in political analysis and voter guidance, laying the groundwork for continued exploration and development in this cross-disciplinary area.
