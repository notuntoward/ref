We base our findings on an original data set of total volatility, extra-system volatility, and within-system volatility for 67 democratic countries across all regions of theworld since1945. The article makes three contributions. First, we show that it is important to distinguish between electoral volatility that represents vote shifts among established parties (within-system volatility) and shifts to new parties (extra-system volatility). Second, we provide descriptive information about total, within-system, and extra-system volatility for 67 countries. Third, we analyze the determinants of volatility. Our results show that the causes of within- and extra- system volatility differ markedly. In contrast to Powell and Tucker, for our broader range of countries and longer time period, there are several statistically robust positive findings. electoral volatility, new democracies, new parties In this article, we analyze the remarkable differences in the electoral success of new parties in 67 democratic countries in the post–World War II period and compare the determi- nants of electoral volatility attributable to new versus estab- lished parties. These questions are relatively new. Prior to the third wave of democratization, they were not on the research agenda because the vote share of new parties was limited in almost all democracies. Most Western European and Anglo-American democratic party systems were stable from the 1920s until 1967, when Lipset and Rokkan (1967) published their seminal contribution on the ‘‘freezing’’ of party systems. Major new parties were uncommon. In many third- and fourth-wave competitive regimes, however, new parties burst on the scene and become important contenders while some established parties fade away. In these coun- tries, party systems are clearly not frozen. Social scientists should systematically capture and account for these differ- ences in the electoral success of new parties. We make three contributions. The first is conceptual/ theoretical. Following Birch (2003: 119–135), Golosov (2004: 47–49), Powell and Tucker (2014), Sikk (2005), and Tavits (2008), we argue that it is important to disaggregate total electoral volatility into the vote share of new parties (which we also call extra-system volatility) and vote trans- fers that go to established parties (within-system volatility). This point holds for a much broader range of countries and much longer time period than the postcommunist countries that were the focus of these earlier works.

The dynamics and characteristics of a party sys- tem are different if new competitors frequently enter the system and capture a significant share of the vote. In this sit- uation, the very parties that compete to win elections change. Whereas within-system volatility reflects change among established parties, extra-system volatility indicates changing membership of the system and reflects dissatisfaction with all of the old parties. Extra-system volatility is a useful indicator of how open or impermeable party systems are. Our second contribution is descriptive. We provide information about total volatility, within-system volatility, and extra-system volatility. We introduce a new data set that covers 67 countries for an extended period of time, beginning in 1945 or the inauguration of a country’s most recent competitive regime, whichever came later, and end- ing in 2006. To the best of our knowledge, the analysis is based on the most comprehensive data set of electoral vola- tility that has been compiled. Our third contribution is explanatory. We analyze the determinants of extra-system volatility and compare these results to those for within-system volatility. Consistent with Powell and Tucker (2014), for 21 postcommunist countriesN ¼ 89 electoral periods), the determinants of extra- system volatility differ sharply from those of within- system volatility. However, in contrast to Powell and Tucker, who found few statistically significant results for extra-system volatility and none for within-system volati- lity, for our much broader range of countries and electoral periods (N ¼ 618), we obtain several significant results. The Birth year of democracy has a robust impact on both kinds of volatility. Democracies established in earlier his- torical periods have much lower extra- and within-system volatility than third- and fourth-wave democracies. The Birth year of democracy is the only variable that consis- tently affects both kinds of volatility. Following a well-established finding in the literature on total volatility, sluggish economic growth facilitates the electoral success of new contenders. Surprisingly, eco- nomic performance has no impact on vote transfers among established parties. Nor did inflation have any impact on any of the dependent variables. Finally, it is easier for new parties to succeed when the system has a higher effective number of parties (ENP). However, a higher ENP has no impact on within-system volatility. Two other variables for institutional openness (district magnitude and presidentialism) consistently had no association with any of the dependent variables. Theoretical expectations The extensive literature on electoral volatility dates back to the 1970s, with many contributions since then. In the 2000s, some articles focused on the vote share of new par- ties and distinguished between electoral volatility attributa- ble to transfers to established parties and to new parties. This literature has focused on the post-Soviet region, so it has been limited to the period since around 1989 (Birch, 2003: 119–135; Golosov, 2004: 47–49; Powell and Tucker, 2014; Sikk, 2005; Tavits, 2008). Powell and Tucker (2014) made an important contribution by systematically compar- ing the correlates of within- and extra-system volatility across 89 electoral periods in the post-Soviet region. We greatly expand the geographic and historic scope of this work on the vote share of new parties. 2 Like Powell and Tucker, we distinguish between within- and extra-system volatility. We describe their distributions across countries and over time and study their differential determinants. 3 In the literature on electoral volatility and the vote share of new parties, some empirical results diverge across differ- ent samples of countries and electoral periods. Nevertheless, these literatures suggest three core hypotheses that we test. First, poor economic performance should lead to higher volatility, primarily by weakening support for the govern- ing party or coalition. Poor economic performance could make it easier for new parties to enter the system by discre- diting the existing labels and generating willingness on the part of voters to support a new option. Second, permeable institutional arrangements such as fragmented party systems and permissive electoral systems should be associated with higher volatility. In fragmented party systems, total electoral volatility has been higher in several studies, perhaps because politicians and voters can defect to more options (Bartolini and Mair, 1990: 131–145; Madrid, 2005: 10; Roberts and Wibbels, 1999; Tavits, 2005). The openness of fragmented party systems might also make it easier for new parties to succeed. In less frag- mented systems, divisions among parties might be harder, making it less likely that voters would defect from an estab- lished party. Likewise, higher district magnitudes (the number of seats per district) should make it easier for new parties to establish an electoral toehold (Tavits, 2006, 2008). Conver- sely, low district magnitudes might reduce volatility and set high barriers for new entrants. The effects of district mag- nitude operate partly through their impact on the number of parties, but district magnitude might have an independent effect on volatility. Third, parties in long established democracies developed strong organizations with deep connections to voters and organized interests, whereas most third- and fourth-wave democracies lack strong parties (Gunther, 2005; Mainwaring and Zoco, 2007; Schmitter, 2001). Along related lines, Roberts and Wibbels (1999) showed that volatility was lower in Latin American democracies with parties that were established earlier. If this argument holds across our larger data set, earlier democracies will have lower electoral vola- tility and a lower vote share of new parties. 2 Party Politics by guest on January 12, 2016ppq.sagepub.comDownloaded from Prior research showed that these hypotheses were well- grounded for total volatility. We did not have strong ex ante reasons to theorize whether they would affect within- and extra-system volatility in different ways. Therefore, we apply these theoretical expectations to both within- and extra-system volatility. Data set and case selection Our data set includes 618 electoral periods in 67 countries in all regions of the world: Western Europe, North Amer- ica, and Oceania (20 countries); Latin America (16); East- ern Europe and post-Soviet Union (14); Asia (8); Africa (4); and 5 others. The historic and geographic scope of the data set is useful for an empirical mapping, for testing hypotheses about the electoral success of new parties, and for verifying whether the same factors drive within- and extra-system volatility. From the point of view of observa- tionally based causal inference, the strength of our sample lies both in its size and in the much larger variability it offers in the independent variables (e.g. gross domestic product (GDP) per capita varies much more between Benin and Norway in our sample than between Albania and Slo- venia in the postcommunist samples). This greater variabil- ity and sample size allow for a more precise estimation of regression coefficients. The analysis includes all countries with at least 1 million inhabitants that as of 2006 had experienced at least four consecutive lower chamber elections during which the country’s Polity score was consistently 3 or higher (includ- ing the years of the elections and all years in between). A Polity score of 3 or higher is designed to eliminate author- itarian regimes. An authoritarian regime’s control of elec- tions favors the governing party and usually limits electoral volatility. Therefore, including elections under authoritarian regimes is likely to produce biased estimates of the effects of the independent variables. We also excluded countries that had experienced an annulled elec- tion during the time period in question. We measure our dependent variables—extra-system and within-system volatility—by decomposing total volatility into two components: (a) the net change in parties’ vote shares from one election to the next that is driven by trans- fers to existing parties (within-system volatility) and (b) the net change in parties’ vote shares that is driven by transfers to new parties. This disaggregation of total electoral vola- tility requires the operationalization of ‘‘new party’’ and the measurement of the vote shares of new parties at each elec- tion. We coded this variable beginning with the second election of a new competitive regime. In the founding elec- tion, the vote share of new parties might be high simply because an antecedent dictatorship had suppressed parties, and the parties from the previous democratic period (if there was one) might not have reappeared. Online Appen- dix 1A provides information on what we counted as new parties and how we treated party schisms, mergers, coali- tions, and changes of name. Specific coding decisions about all 618 electoral periods and 67 countries are avail- able from the authors and will be made available online along with the data set. Variance in extra-system and within-system volatility Table 1 reports total electoral volatility, within-system volatility, and extra-system volatility for the lower chamber of the 67 countries that meet the selection criteria described 4 New parties win a meaningful share of the vote. The mean vote share for new parties is 6.5% taking the electoral period as the unit of analysis and 10.5% at the country level. (There are many more electoral periods for the average old democracy in the data set, so the country mean is higher.) For the average country, 42% of total elec- toral volatility represents transfers to new parties and 58% is within-system volatility. Mean total volatility is 17.8% for the 618 electoral periods and 25.2% for the 67 countries. The cross-country differences are huge. Mean total vola- tility is 20 times greater in Benin (68.3%) than in the United States (3.4%). Mean extra-system volatility ranges from 0.1% (the United States) to 41.8% (Benin). Some party systems (e.g., the United States) pose dauting barriers to the success of new entrants, while new competitors have a much easier time achieving success in many countries. Mean within-system volatility ranges from 3.3% (the United States) to 30.0% (Poland). Regional differences in all three kinds of volatility are high. High extra-system volatility characterizes most third- and fourth-wave competitive regimes. New parties have had little success in long-established democracies, consis- tent with Lipset and Rokkan’s (1967) notion of ‘‘frozen’’ party systems. The mean vote share of new parties in com- petitive regimes established by 1945 was 2.4% in all elec- tions from 1945 to 2006 compared to 14.6% for new parties in competitive regimes established in the third and fourth waves. Mean total volatility was 13.2% for 475 electoral periods for democracies established before 1978 compared to 32.9% for 143 electoral periods for democracies estab- lished in 1978 or later. Newer democracies also have a higher share of extra- system volatility, consistent with Powell and Tucker’s (2014) observation about the post-Soviet cases. In democ- racies inaugurated before 1978, 30% of total volatility goes to new parties and 70% is within-system volatility. In the democracies established in 1978 or thereafter, 44% of total volatility is extra-system and 56% is within-system.

For example, Figure 1(a) shows that the median extra- system volatility for all competitive regimes inaugurated between 1981 and 1987 (the next to last segment on the-axis) was 5.6%. Each of these 28 pairs of medians was then connected by a straight line in order to show more clearly how median volatility varies from older to younger Figures 1(a) and (b) also show all the volatility scores for all elections in the data set (shown as small letters ‘‘x’’ 6) for countries whose competitive regimes were inau- gurated in a given year. All the scores for a given country appear vertically above the year in which its current dem- ocratic regime was established. For example, all volatility scores for a democracy born in 1978 appear in the graph vertically above the value 1978 on the x-axis. With the exception of a peak for democracies born around 1850 (mostly due to several high extra-system volatility elections in Costa Rica and New Zealand), the median vote share of new parties for democracies born before 1945 is 0. In contrast, for democracies born after 1945 and especially since the 1980s, the trend is steadily upward. In more recently established competitive regimes, new parties enjoyed more support. In the last band of Figure 1(a) (cor- responding to the period 1988–1994), median extra-system volatility rises to a maximum of 12.3%, and it also shows some of the highest scores in the whole sample, as indicated by several observations above 50% on the y-axis. Within-system volatility follows a different pattern. Although democracies born in the 1980s and 1990s have had higher within-system volatility than old democracies, democracies born in the 19th century were not markedly less prone to within-system volatility than those established in the first seven decades of the 20th century. These histor- ical trends underscore the differences between both types of volatility. The success of new contenders is mostly a phenomenon of post-1945 and especially post-1978 democracies, while vote flows between established parties affect both old and new democracies. For the 618 electoral periods, the correlation between within-system volatility and extra-system volatility is essentially 0 (r ¼ 0.03; p value ¼ 0.42), providing addi- tional evidence that it is useful to separate the two; they do not vary in lock step. Extra-system volatility often sug- gests a very different picture than within-system volatility. Table 1.

And to what degree do the determi- nants of within-system volatility differ from those of extra-system volatility? We hypothesized that poor eco- nomic performance, more permissive electoral rules, and more fragmented party systems and democracies born more recently would have higher volatility of both types. Economic performance We measure economic performance with short-term per capita GDP growth and inflation, tracking average annual change from the year of the first election in an electoral period to the year before the second elec- tion. For inflation, we used the natural log because we expect a nonlinear effect, given some extreme val- ues (up to an average 2593% per year for an electoral period).7 Institutional openness A higher ENP increases volatility. We measure the ENP in votes (Laakso and Taagepera, 1979). The ENP in the first election of an electoral period is the value for that observa- tion; the measurement for ENP antecedes the measures for volatility. Volatility and the number of parties are concep- tually unrelated: volatility can be high if a major party loses all its votes to another party, yet the ENP will remain unchanged. Likewise, a system with many parties will have low volatility if their vote shares are stable. A higher district magnitude fosters higher volatility. Our mea- sure is the natural log of the mean effective magnitude (Taagepera and Shugart, 1989: 126–141).8 The correlation between district magnitude logged and ENP is only 0.30, and the variance inflation factor (VIF) statistics for these two variables in our models below are modest (1.24 and 1.20, respectively), so there is no problem of multicolli- nearity by including both variables in the regressions. Presidentialism fosters higher electoral volatility. In presidential and semi-presidential systems, individuals can more easily become head of government without having the backing of a major party (Samuels and Shugart, 2010). The potential to capture executive power without establishing an extensive national organization might lower barriers for new parties in presidential elections, with possible spillovers to legisla- tive elections. Waves of democracy Democracies that were inaugurated more recently have higherTo test this hypothesis, we used the natural log of the number of years from the birth of democracy until 2006 because we expect a diminishing effect over time. We call this measure ‘‘Birth year of democracy.’’ Control variables An alternative hypothesis to the one about the Birth year of democracy is that regardless of when they were born, party systems might become more stable over time as voters have more time to identify with parties (Brader and Tucker, 2001; Converse, 1969). We test this hypothesis by includ- ing a variable for the logged number of years since the inauguration of democracy until a given election (‘‘Age of democracy’’). Whereas Age of democracy changes from one electoral period to the next, Birth year of democracy is constant for all electoral periods for a given country. The two variables are highly correlated empirically (r ¼ 0.82) but are different theoretically. Birth year of democracy cap- tures ‘‘cohort effects,’’ that is, the causal impact of factors associated with characteristics of the historical period in which a democracy was born. Age of democracy is about ‘‘age effects,’’ that is, about whether volatility changes as010203040506070Extra-system volatility 1800 1850 (a) 1900 1950 2000 Birth year of democracy010203040506070Within-system volatility 1800 1850 1900 1950 2000 Birth year of democracy (b) Figure 1.

These two variables would be indistinguishable in a cross-sectional data set but can be disentangled with our time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data. In the tables below, we refer to them as ‘‘Birth year of democracy (cohort effects)’’ and ‘‘Age of democracy (age effects).’’ We use the natural log of per capita GDP based on the estimates of the Penn World Tables as a control variable to assess whether unmeasured factors in wealthier countries account for lower volatility. Without this control, a positive finding for Birth year of democracy or Age of democracy might stem from some unspecified characteristics of weal- thier democracies. Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for the depen- dent and (unlogged) independent variables. Each electoral period in a country is one observation. Methods, results, and interpretation We estimate our models through generalized estimating equations (GEE), which is appropriate for panel data when the goal is to obtain population-averaged estimates (Zorn, 2001). GEE models are appropriate for data sets with temporally correlated errors and with more units than time periods (ours contain 67 countries and a mean of 9.2 electoral periods per country) (Beck, 2001: 273–274). We chose an autoregressive correlation structure, AR(1), because we expect the dependent variables to be posi- tively correlated over time, and we expect this correlation to be larger for consecutive elections than for those farther apart in time. The AR(1) specification has the additional advantage of not demanding too much from the data (only one r parameter has to be estimated). We ran the models with semi-robust standard errors, which are valid even if the assumed structure is incorrect, and with the Stata option ‘‘force,’’ which includes observations that are not equallyspaced intime. Models 1 to 3 in Table 3 show results for the eight inde- pendent variables for which we have almost complete datan ¼ 604). Models 4 to 6 drop Age of democracy to allevi- ate problems of multicollinearity (the mean and maximum VIF in models 1 to 3 are 1.91 and 3.80, respectively; they fall to 1.31 and 1.61 in models 4 to 6). Results between the two sets of models are highly consistent. Birth year of democracy is the only variable that has a powerful impact on all three dependent variables.9 Democ- racies that were born earlier have lower volatility of all three kinds, thus supporting arguments about the critical importance of the historical period in which competitive regimes were established. Its impact is powerful statisti- cally and substantively. Because the regressions include per capita GDP, the impact of Birth year of democracy does not stem primarily from greater wealth in the countries where democracy was inaugurated earlier. Many democracies that were born gen- erations ago did not have high per capita GDPs at that time, and on average, they had low electoral volatility. Conver- sely, some countries that have transitioned to democracy in the third and fourth waves are fairly wealthy but have had high volatility (e.g. South Korea). The correlation between the natural log form of per capita GDP and Birth year of democracy (ln) is only 0.43. The results support the theoretical expectations about the impact of economic performance and institutional arrangements but only for specific independent variables. Both hypotheses hold up for within- or extra-system vola- tility but not both. Sluggish or negative economic growth consistently increased extra-system and total volatility, but it had no influence on within-system volatility. Thus, when voting patterns shift because of poor economic growth, they appear to turn against all existing parties rather than switch- ing to an alternative within the system.

Inflation was not signifi- cant in any of the six models. We also ran models with medium term growth and infla- tion and with change in inflation from the previous to the current electoral period (logged). Against expectations, these three variables were consistently insignificant for all three dependent variables across many model specifica- tions. We do not present the results. The covariates for institutional openness also have mixed results. A higher ENP makes it easier for new parties to win votes, but it has no impact on within-system volati- lity. The frequent finding that a higher ENP is associated with higher total volatility (Bartolini and Mair, 1990: 131–145; Roberts and Wibbels, 1999; Tavits, 2005) there- fore stems primarily from the effect on extra-system vola- tility. The substantive effect on the vote share of new parties is meaningful. In model 2, an increase of 1 in ENP is associated with a predicted increase of 1.8% in extra- system volatility. This difference in the impact of ENP on within- and extra-system volatility makes intuitive sense. With more constricted party systems, it is usually riskier for politicians to jump ship and form a new party. Only a few parties are serious contenders, so strategic voters might be more reluctant to abandon the existing options. Conversely, in more open party systems, politicians face lower hurdles in winning votes if they form new parties. Strategic voters are less likely to waste their votes if they cast their ballot for a new entrant. Against expectations, district magnitude and presidenti- alism were not statistically significant for within-system, extra-system, or total volatility. Total volatility, extra-system volatility, and possibly within-system volatility tend to be lower in wealthier democracies; the coefficients for per capita GDP (ln) on all three dependent variables are negative and statistically sig- nificant in models 1 to 3. They remain negative and signif- icant in the models without Age of democracy, although only at the 10% significance level for within-system vola- tility (model 6). With both it and Birth year of democracy in the same regression (Table 3), Age of democracy appears to have a surprising impact: as democracies get older, within- system and total volatility increases. This is due to the high correlation between Birth year of democracy and Age of democracy. A more detailed analysis of Age of democracy reveals a generally weak and inconsistent effect of Age of democracy on within- and extra-system volatility.

For the first two waves for which we have data points (1885–1921 and 1944–1953), extra-system volatility is essentially flat over time. It shows a gradually increasing trend for the few cases of democratization that began between 1954 and 1971 and a declining trend for the third- and fourth-wave cases (con- sistent with Powell and Tucker, 2014). Given these results and the high multicollinearity that affects Age of democ- racy in our parametric regression models (which implies that its coefficient is estimated with less precision than oth- ers), we cannot safely draw clear conclusions about age effects on volatility. The coefficients for Age of democracy are consistently much smaller in magnitude and less signif- icant than for Birth year of democracy. Models 4 to 6 drop Age of democracy to estimate the remaining coefficients more efficiently (especially that of Birth year of democracy, which is highly collinear with the excluded variable). The only coefficients that change notice- ably are those of Birth year of democracy, which become smaller inabsolutemagnitude than in models 1to3. How- ever, their sign and high significance remain unchanged. We ran some models adding union density to models 1 to 3 in Table 3, but it was not significant for any of the three dependent variables (n ¼ 498). We tested this variable because in some analyses, strong linkages between voters and parties via organizational attachments lowered volati- lity (Bartolini and Mair, 1990: 231–238; Madrid, 2005; Roberts and Wibbels, 1999: 582). With union density in the regression equation, per capita GDP was not significant for extra- or within-system volatility (but it was for total vola- tility). Otherwise, the results were consistent with models 1 to 3. Our results diverge markedly from Powell and Tucker’s (2014) for the post-Soviet cases. In their sample, no indepen- dent variable affected within-system volatility, and only one, economic growth since 1989, affected extra-system volati- lity. In contrast, we have many significant coefficients. Different factors drive within- and extra-system volati- lity. To summarize these differences, Table 4 synthesizes the results of Table 3, showing only the covariates that were sometimes statistically significant. The determinants of within- and extra-system volatility differ markedly, lending support to the argument that it is important to distinguish between them. The most robust and powerful findings concern the Birth year of democracy. To show the substantive effects of this explanatory variable in a multivariate analysis, Table 5 simulates the decreases in volatility for a democracy born 1 year earlier, comparing 1995 to a baseline of 1996, 1985 compared to 1986, 1955 versus 1956, 1905 versus 1906, and 1805 versus 1806. We start at 1806 and finish at 1996 as the baseline years to approximate our real data. We simulate results using the coefficients from models 1 to 3 of Table 3. Extra-system volatility decreases by 0.44% for a democracy established in 1995 rather than 1996, by% comparing a democracy created in 1985 to 1986, and so forth. The substantive impact of an earlier Birth year of democracy is considerable. Robustness checks Given the sensitivity of TSCS analysis to different specifi- cations, we checked how robust these findings are to alter- native TSCS estimators. In Appendix 1, we rerun the model with extra-system volatility (panel A) and within-system volatility (panel B) as the dependent variables. We include all five independent variables with nearly complete infor- mation that were significant for any of the three dependent variables in models 1 to 3 of Table 3, dropping the three independent variables that consistently had no impact. We use three different estimators and compare the results to the GEE estimates, which are in column 1. The alterna- tives used are Beck and Katz’s (1995, 1996) panel- corrected standard errors with an autoregressive 1 (AR1) process (PCSE þ AR[1]) and with a lagged dependent vari- able (PCSE þ LDV) and the random effects estimator. (We do not use fixed-effects estimators because they are unable to produce results for the time-invariant variable Birth year of democracy.) Most of the results are robust, and they rein- force the general story that the determinants of within- system and extra-system volatility differ. To check for the possibility that some results are driven by outlying observations or countries, we ran models 1 to 3 in Table 3, dropping all observations that are more than 3 standard deviations from the mean on at least one of the independent variables. The resulting models (N ¼ 567) do not differ in any significant way from the full sample models with one exception: the coefficient for GDP growth in the regression for extra-system volatility remains nega- tive but drops in magnitude to less than half of its previous size and becomes not significant at conventional levels (p value ¼ 0.14). It is also possible that some results are driven by an aty- pical country. We implemented a robustness analysis akin Table 4. Determinants of within- and extra-system volatility.

Mainwaring et al. 9 by guest on January 12, 2016ppq.sagepub.comDownloaded from to Cook’s distance diagnosis in cross-sectional ordinary least square regressions by running our GEE models 67 times, dropping all electoral periods corresponding to a par- ticular country. We then analyzed the distribution of the 67 resulting slopes and t-statistics for each of the independent variables. All the coefficients kept their signs and signifi- cance levels (and their magnitudes did not vary much) with one minor exception. Age of democracy in the extra-system volatility model, which is not significant in the full sample, is significant at the 0.05 level (in a positive direction) in the model that drops the four electoral periods for Romania. Overall, these two tests show that our findings do not depend on atypical observations or countries. We also ran the models in Table 3 for total volatility and extra-system volatility by region (the regions are indicated in Table 1, but we merged Africa, Asia, and ‘‘other’’ due to the small number of countries and observations in each of them separately) and by the historical period in which democracy was established in each country (pre-1944, 1944–1973, and post-1974 or ‘‘third wave’’). Results and a summary discus- sion are posted in online Appendix 1C. Most coefficients keep their signs and levels of significance in all subsamples or become indistinguishable from 0 (a result expected on sta- tistical grounds, given that each subsample includes fewer observations clustered within fewer countries that typically display lower variance on the independent variables, all fac- tors that make standard errors larger and achieving conven- tional levels of significance harder). This article builds on Powell and Tucker (2014) and other recent work by distinguishing between extra- and within- system electoral volatility. This distinction is important because a vote transfer among established parties might reflect transitory shifts within the existing system without any movement toward a change of the system, whereas high extra-system volatility indicates a change of the system. We made a descriptive contribution about electoral volatility and its two subcomponents, within- and extra- system volatility, showing the patterns of geographical and temporal variation. The sample is much larger than that of previous studies, greatly increasing the number and diver- sity of the included countries and considerably lengthening the temporal coverage relative to most previous work. Extra-system volatility is an important phenomenon in third- and fourth-wave democracies, thus buttressing the notion that it is useful to distinguish between within- system and extra-system volatility. Two countries with similar total volatility can have very different extra- system volatility, demonstrating divergences in voters’ willingness to flee from existing parties and different levels of dissatisfaction with all existing parties. The very mem- bership of the party system changes when new parties cap- ture a meaningful share of the vote. The third contribution of this article is explanatory. The analysis of extra-system volatility and how it compares with within-system volatility is in its infancy, notwith- standing recent contributions (Birch, 2003; Powell and Tucker, 2014; Sikk, 2005; Tavits 2006, 2008). Our article shows that the determinants of these two types of volatility diverge markedly. Whereas Powell and Tucker (2014) find almost no significant predictors of within- or extra-system volatility, our sample supports several hypotheses for both kinds of volatility. The Birth year of democracy has a strong influence on extra-system, within-system, and total volatility. We can- not resolve what the specific mechanisms behind this find- ing are, but previous work has suggestively emphasized that parties in older democracies were much more encom- passing and penetrating. An early history of strong organi- zations and powerful identities created deep attachments to parties in old democracies. Parties forged strong and endur- ing linkages to voters. They served as agents of political mobilization, successfully pushed for the incorporation of new citizens into politics, and offered health and recrea- tional benefits. Voters developed political identities closely connected to their parties. Even today, parties remain cru- cial in structuring the vote in these countries (Bartels, 2000; Green et al., 2002). Media effects might also help explain the large difference in volatility between democracies established generations ago and more recently established competitive regimes. Before television was an important means for transmitting campaign information, politicians developed organizational ties to voters. If mass television anteceded strong party orga- nizations, as is the case in most third-wave competitive regimes, politicians can more easily appeal for votes through television, and they have less need to build parties. Where candidates can carry out effective electoral campaigns largely through the mass media, established party labels are less essential for reaching voters. Television and internet Table 5.

In most third- and fourth-wave competitive regimes, political elites have weaker incentives to invest in party building. Strong party organizations are typically less cru- cial to electoral success, so party labels are less valuable and party substitutes are more common (Hale, 2006). Many candidates have won the presidency running on new party labels. Many of them eschewed building a powerful party organization even after their election. The fact that well- structured organizations are not essential to electoral vic- tory makes it less costly to start a new party. In most later competitive regimes, parties have played a less central role in citizens’ lives. Citizens are more willing to shift their votes to new contenders. Except for Birth year of democracy and per capita GDP, the statistically significant findings differ for within- and extra-system volatility. A higher ENP is associated with more electoral support for new parties but not with greater within-system volatility. A high ENP signals an open elec- toral market. In these contexts, new parties face lower bar- riers, and citizens’ votes for new parties are more likely to be meaningful. Poor short-term economic growth perfor- mance is favorable to the electoral success of new conten- ders but surprisingly does not affect within-system volatility. These results raise intriguing new questions for a future research agenda. Do these differences in the determinants of within- and extra-system volatility hold up for even larger samples of countries and electoral periods? And why do the determinants of within- and extra-system differ so much? By expanding the range of countries and time period, and by testing for a wide range of independent vari- ables, we have added to the emerging literature on the vote share of new parties and the differences in the correlates of within- and extra-system volatility.

Mainwaring et al. 11 by guest on January 12, 2016ppq.sagepub.comDownloaded from As shown in panel A, weak per capita GDP growth and a higher number of parties are associated with an increased vote share of new parties in all models (although slightly below conventional levels of significance—p-value ¼ 0.12—in the model with a lagged dependent variable). Birth Year of Democracy and GDP per capita obtain the expected signs and high levels of significance in all models. Age of Democracy is always positive but significant at the 0.05 level in only one model. The findings obtained using GEE for within-system volatility are robust to other estimation alternatives (panel B). All coefficients keep their expected signs and high lev- els of significance. Moreover, their magnitudes change only moderately from model to model. Interestingly and in contrast with panel A, GDP growth achieves statistical significance in the model with a lagged dependent variable, providing some evidence that good economic performance may lower within-system volatility.

Electoral volatility is computed by adding the absolute value of change in the percentage of votes gained or lost by each party from one election to the next and dividing by two so that gains and losses are not double counted. 2. A related body of literature has analyzed the number of new parties that enter—a different dependent variable than the one studied here. See Hug (2001) and Tavits (2006, 2008). 3. Powell and Tucker call extra-system volatility type A and within-system volatility type B. 4. Electoral data for Benin for 1999 are based on partial results. 5. We used Stata’s default number of bands, defined as the max- imum of 10 and round (10 \u0000 log 10 (N)), where N is the num- ber of observations. Applied to our N of 618 for both dependent variables, the formula yields 28 bands. 6. Some areas of these figures do not contain any ‘‘x’’ markers. They correspond to periods in which no new democracies lasted until the end point of our data set (2006). For example, no democracies established between 1922 and 1943 survived until 2006. 7. Gross domestic product per capita growth is based on the World Bank’s World Development Indicators for 1961– 2006 and on Penn World Tables for 1951–1960. For most countries, data for inflation come from Mitchell (1998a, 1998b) for 1945–1960; Bruno and Easterly (1998) for 1960–1994; and IMF (2008) for 1995–2006. It is not possible to calculate a log for a negative value. To minimize the num- ber of missing cases, we assume that inflation below 1% per year including deflation has an impact on electoral volatility that is indistinguishable from that of an inflation rate of 1%. We recorded all such cases as having a logged inflation of 0. 8. For mixed systems (Bolivia, Hungary, Japan, Lithuania, Mexico, Romania, Russia, and Venezuela 1993–1998), we took a weighted mean based on the percentage of seats allo- cated in the two systems and the average magnitude of seats allocated via proportional representation. 9. We interpret the regression coefficients causally, given that there are good theoretical reasons to do so. As it is the case with all research based on observational data, statistical results cannot ‘‘prove’’ causality, but they do provide empirical evi- dence that is either consistent (or inconsistent) with a causal impact of the independent on the dependent variables and therefore increase (decrease) confidence in the hypotheses. 10.
