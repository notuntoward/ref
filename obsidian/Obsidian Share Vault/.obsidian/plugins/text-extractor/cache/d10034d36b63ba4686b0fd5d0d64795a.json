RYAN The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, United States YANNA KRUPNIKOV Stony Brook University, United States R esearch in psychology has established that people have visceral positive and negative reactions to all kinds of stimuli—so-called implicit attitudes. Implicit attitudes are empirically distinct from explicit attitudes, and they appear to have separate consequences for political behavior. However, little is known about whether they change in response to different factors than explicit attitudes. Identifying distinct antecedents for implicit and explicit attitudes would have far-reaching implications for the study of political persuasion. We hypothesized that implicit attitudes would change primarily in response to political advertisements’ emotional valence, but this turned out to be wrong. In contrast, our next hypothesis that implicit (but not explicit) attitudes would improve in response to increased familiarity with an attitude object was supported across several tests. Aside from this finding, our studies illustrate how routine preregistration helps researchers convey what they learned from each test—including when predictions are not borne out. O ne of the most effective television ads to air during the 2016 campaign season was a spot created for Bernie Sanders’ unsuccessful pri- mary run. The ad, titled “America,” is striking for its minimalistic style. It is 60 seconds long, but aside from a legally required statement in the final three seconds (“I’m Bernie Sanders, and I approve this message”), it includes no narration whatsoever. No list of accom- plishments, no policy statements, and no criticism of his opponents. Instead, there are fleeting shots of regular- looking people cheering and high-fiving during Sanders campaign events, interspersed with a mélange of Americana: farmers milking cows, boats in a harbor, and so forth—all set to an uplifting Simon and Garfun- kel melody. Although the ad offers no explicit reasons whatsoever for why the viewer should support Sanders, a professional analysis of viewer reactions dubbed “America” to be “the ad that moved people the most” (Vavreck 2016). “America” is an extreme example, but few people would dispute that campaign ads are routinely thin on substance—and the academic literature agrees (e.g., Kaid and Johnston 2001). Still, the scholarly under- standing of how messaging elements beyond substance work remains minimal. For many years, research focused primarily on framing effects—the capacity of political messages to make some substantive consider- ations more salient than others are (e.g., Chong and Druckman 2007a). This focus certainly captures one important facet of campaign messaging, but as Brader (2006) discusses, it puts aside an array of other psycho- logical mechanisms via which campaign advertisements might be influential. As researchers have begun to systematically study the emotional components of pol- itical messaging, they have discovered that music, imagery, metaphors, and other nonsubstantive compo- nents of political advertising indeed influence voters in a host of ways (see Brader and Marcus 2013 for a review). Our purpose herein is to increase understanding of how the emotional components of political advertising work. So far, the study of nonsubstantive facets of campaign messaging has relied almost entirely on self-reports—about the emotions citizens experience and their liking for particular candidates relative to others. While critical, this work puts aside an extensive body of research in psychology finding that many aspects of human behavior are influenced by visceral positive and negative reactions that are not conducive to being measured with self-reports—so-called implicit attitudes (e.g., Banaji and Heiphetz 2010). Implicit attitudes appear to have an independent influence on political judgments (e.g., Ryan 2017), and as we discuss below, they might be especially ripe for manipulation via political advertising. As such, the current literature might be missing an entire domain of important cam- paign effects. The largest contribution of the studies below is to demonstrate the critical relevance of implicit/explicit attitude dissociation to the enterprise of political per- suasion. Each of our tests serves to illustrate that impli- cit and explicit attitudes can change independently, and in response to different stimuli. As such, this work provides an impetus to revisit a wide array of findings related to political messaging, asking what effects the field might have missed, given its almost exclusive focus on explicit attitudes. Second, we begin to characterize the kinds of campaign messages that move implicit versus explicit attitudes. We find that, while implicit and explicit attitudes are interrelated and many stimuli affect both domains, interventions that increase famil- iarity with a candidate work primarily by influencing implicit attitudes.

The contributions of this manuscript are (1) to show that mere exposure effects act primarily on impli- cit rather than explicit attitudes and (2) to elucidate the important role that familiarity effects and implicit atti- tudes play in the context of political campaigning. For instance, as we discuss in our conclusion, the patterns we uncover may point to a key psychological mechan- ism that makes common low-information campaign tools (such as lawn signs) effective. This slate of studies is also distinctive in that it reflects a gradual change in our thinking. At the outset, we subscribed to a framework that is prominent in psych- ology: the associative-propositional evaluation (APE) model (Gawronski and Bodenhausen 2006; 2014). However, our initial tests did not support this model. Instead, they seemed consistent with the “mere familiarity” effects we allude to above. Thus, we put the APE model aside, and developed new experiments focused on testing mere familiarity relationships, find- ing support. We documented this evolution in our thinking in five distinct preregistration documents. Because these documents clarify the theoretical focus of each test and what we learned from it, this series of studies illustrates how commitment to routine preregis- tration helps researchers understand and communicate research findings—including for studies where predic- tions are not borne out.1 IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT ATTITUDES The distinction between implicit and explicit attitudes relates to the two-part process that psychologists believe characterizes human mental evaluations (Sherman, Gawronski, and Trope 2014).2 First, when a person encounters an attitude object (another person, a kind of food, or almost anything else), one set of mental processes rapidly draws on associations in mem- ory and generates positive or negative affect. These processes are termed “automatic” because they are distraction-proof: they occur irrespective of motivation and any concurrent mental processes (Bargh and Chartland 1999). Second, a separate set of mental processes forms an evaluation. These processes are termed “controlled” because they engage higher-order cognition and have the potential to revise the automatic response (Olson and Fazio 2008). Answering a survey question requires higher-order cognition.3 For this reason, self-reports by definition capture evaluations that have been influenced by the controlled processes (Gawronski and Bodenhausen 2007, 691). To capture more visceral responses before they are influenced by higher-order mental processes, psychologists devised several measures of implicit atti- tudes (see Petty, Fazio, and Briñol 2008 for an overview). The most popular of these is the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz 1998). The IAT is a latency-based measure in which subjects are asked to associate objects from categories of interest to a researcher (e.g., cans of Coke vs. cans of Pepsi) with positive and negative words. By examining the speed with which subjects make these classifications across several trials, it is possible to determine whether they have stronger visceral positive associations with one category (Coke) than the other (Pepsi).4 When measured within the same individual, implicit and explicit attitudes are routinely correlated with each other—but not to the extent to be considered different manifestations of one mental construct. The correl- ations vary by attitude domain, but they typically range from r = 0.10 to r = 0.54 (Greenwald et al. 2009, Table 3; see also Greenwald and Nosek 2008). This divergence is significant, as it opens up the possibility that each class of attitude might predict behaviors that the other does not. And so it seems they do. Across dozens of studies, in almost every instance in which implicit and explicit measures are used to predict the same behavior simul- taneously, each has incremental predictive validity relative to the other (Greenwald et al. 2009). Put another way, this research suggests that implicit and explicit attitudes may have separable effects on behav- ior. Characterizing which behaviors are governed by implicit versus explicit attitudes remains a vibrant area of research. There is some evidence that implicit attitudes predict “uncontrolled” behaviors better— spontaneous, nondeliberative, nonverbal actions such as physical posture (Dovidio, Kawakami, and Gaertner 2002; Quillian 2008), though this pattern might be limited to socially sensitive topics, such as race and discrimination (Greenwald et al. 2009, 30). In the pol- itical domain, there is evidence that implicit attitudes about candidates and parties predict voting decisions, policy support, and biases in the processing of political information—though the significance of implicit atti- tudes might depend on the intensity of explicit attitudes (Lundberg and Payne 2014; Pérez 2016; Ryan 2017). Research on the political consequences of implicit attitudes should continue, but our objective herein is to make progress in a separate research area: the ways in which elites can use political messages to manipulate implicit attitudes. Research on the antecedents of implicit attitudes is far less extensive than research on consequences—both in the study of political behavior and in psychology more generally.5 Yet, if we are to 1 Our thinking in this regard was influenced by Platt’s classic (1964) essay on “strong inference,” which calls for iterative tests focused on specific, narrow theoretical propositions. 2 The dual-process framework we describe here is similar to, and shares common ancestry with, the two-systems framework that is now a major paradigm in psychology (Kahneman 2011). However, the two-systems framework is somewhat broader in scope, as it encom- passes not only attitudes but also judgments, habits, and heuristics. 3 Even if one is engaged in satisficing, there is still some basic translation from thought to response option—though this translation may be cursory (Cannell, Miller, and Oksenberg 1981). 4 See Lane et al. (2007) for an excellent general overview of the IAT. 5 Though see Alberston (2011) for a study showing that exposure to a religious speech improves implicit attitudes toward George W. Bush among Christian—but not non-Christian—respondents. Timothy J. Ryan and Yanna Krupnikov 2Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

We next turn to what the research in social and cognitive psychology has to say on this matter. ASSOCIATIVE AND PROPOSITIONAL ROUTES TO ATTITUDE CHANGE Implicit attitude change, as well as its relationship to explicit attitude change is an active area of research in psychology. There are several competing theoretical models, though also some points of consensus (Cone, Mann, and Ferguson 2017, for a review). We theoret- ically ground our investigations by focusing on one model in particular: the APE model proposed by Gawronski and Bodenhausen (2014). We focused on the APE for two reasons. First, it reflects one important point of consensus: that implicit attitude change is best understood in the dual-process framework, wherein implicit attitudes represent fast, automatic, uncon- trolled responses, while explicit attitudes reflect the output of slower, controlled processing. Alternatives to the APE, such as the meta-cognitive model (Petty, Briñol, and DeMarree 2007), still work from the prem- ise that implicit and explicit attitudes arise from two distinct (though potentially interrelated) mental sys- tems.6 Second, it is arguably the most prominent model in the literature, and draws on more than a decade of empirical work (Gawronski and Bodenhausen 2006; 2018). This extensive body of research helped us to understand testable implications for political messa- ging. The key distinction in the APE model is between propositional and associative mental processes. Prop- ositional processes are a form of higher-order cognition and focus on assessing whether propositions are true or false. To form an evaluation, the brain assesses the truth value and logical interrelationship of propositions relevant to the judgment at hand. For instance, a person would be engaged in propositional thinking if she reasoned, “Higher taxes on corporations are desirable. Bernie Sanders favors higher taxes on corporations. Therefore, I should support (or be more likely to support) Bernie Sanders.” The end result of reasoning like this, the APE posits, is what explicit attitude meas- ures capture. Where propositional processes focus on truth and falsity, associative processes focus on positivity and negativity. As people interact with the world, the stim- uli they encounter bring to mind the feelings, positive and negative, that previously co-occurred with similar stimuli—the principle that neurons that “fire together, wire together.”7 For instance, a person who has previ- ously had favorable interactions with dogs will, upon seeing a new dog, experience positive affect, as for this person “dog” is associated with positive experiences such as cuddling on a couch. But a person who has been bitten by a dog in the past might have a contrary response, as the stimulus would evoke memories of pain and fear. Importantly, these two people might still agree on the truth or falsity of a specific proposition, such as “this particular dog is friendly.” Associative processing helps explain why they might have very different gut reactions nonetheless. Where propositional processing is costly (in terms of cognitive resources) and is posited to occur only when a person has sufficient motivation, associative processing occurs quickly and automatically, irrespective of motiv- ations. Following this reasoning, Gawronski and Bod- enhausen argue that implicit attitude measures capture the outputs of associative processes—gut responses that have not yet been refined by higher-order cogni- tion. The APE Model also provides guidance for how implicit and explicit attitudes change. Because explicit attitudes are based on propositional reasoning, they should change in response to seemingly valid informa- tion and arguments—things that cause a person to accept new premises that are relevant to a judgment. Moreover, explicit attitudes can potentially change rapidly, such as if new information sharply undermines the previous basis for a judgment. For example, sup- pose that a Democrat saw a political activist with a red baseball cap and white lettering that appeared to be Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again!” slo- gan. The person would likely reason that the activist is a Trump supporter and dislike him. But suppose that upon closer inspection, the lettering turned out to be a parody, saying, “Make Obama President Again!” The construal of the activists’ political loyalties would change drastically, and explicit attitudes about him likely would as well. Where the APE Model sees explicit attitude change as grounded in the assignment of truth values, it sees implicit attitude change as grounded in associations built up via conditioning—the pairing of a stimulus and a positive or negative response. Appraisals about truth are beside the point here; what are relevant are patterns. Researchers commonly use “evaluative conditioning” to induce implicit attitude change— pairing attitude objects like “youth” and “elderly” with positive and negative words on a computer screen, for example, can affect the valence associated with these characteristics (Karpinski and Hilton 2001). There are 6 The main points of disagreement among the models concern the nature of the interrelationship and how to classify what kinds of stimuli will be processed by each (Cone, Mann, and Ferguson 2017). In at least one case, we suspect that the differences among models are exaggerated. Independent research teams arrived at similar conclu- sions, but described their ideas differently. For instance, Gregg, Seibt, and Banaji (2006) attribute explicit attitude change to “abstract supposition” and implicit attitude change to “concrete learning.” The differences compared with propositional versus associative men- tal processes (APE’s focus) strike us as largely semantic. 7 This phrase is sometimes wrongly attributed to Hebb (1949). In fact, it appears to have been coined by Schatz (1992, 64) summarizing Hebb’s ideas.

The APE Model suggests that a single stimulus might have very different effects on implicit versus explicit attitudes, depending on the inferences and associations a person draws from the stimulus. For instance, in one test, participants underwent a procedure in which a neutral stimulus (a fictional creature) appeared on a computer screen two seconds before the end of an unpleasant sound (horrified screaming). This proced- ure caused explicit attitudes toward the creature to improve—presumably because the participants reasoned that the appearance of the creature caused an end to the sound. But it simultaneously caused implicit attitudes toward the creature to worsen—pre- sumably because the creature appeared while a sound was causing an unpleasant feeling (Moran and Bar- Anan 2013). In sum, the APE is a promising theoretical perspec- tive with a substantial evidence base in pure psych- ology. It posits implicit and explicit attitudes to change via independent routes, one focused on positive and negative associations and other focused on assessments of truth and falsity. These premises might clarify how political practitioners use different communication tools to influence separate (but both important) atti- tudes that guide citizen behavior. However, APE’s implications for political messaging strategy have not been directly tested. We begin our investigations with a study focused on one provocative implication of the APE Model as it might manifest in a political context. STUDY 1: HOW DOES EMOTIONAL CONTENT AFFECT IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT ATTITUDES? As we discuss above, the APE model posits that explicit attitudes change in response to information that can be assessed as true or false, whereas implicit attitudes change when a stimulus is paired with positive or negative experiences. Applied to political communica- tion, a reasonable interpretation of these propositions is that the informational content in a campaign message acts primarily on explicit attitudes, while the affective content in the message acts primarily on implicit atti- tudes. Study 1 tests these ideas. We exposed partici- pants to advertisements where the information provided by the ad was held constant but the affective content varied. As we document in our preregistration (available in the Supporting Information), our expect- ation was that high-quality affective content would improve implicit attitudes. Because the advertisements used provided almost nothing by way of substantive political information that could be used to gauge a candidate’s political positions or likely behavior, we also predicted null effects on explicit attitudes. Procedures. Testing the expectation above required exposing participants to ads that varied in terms of the emotions they induce but not the information they provide. To create such ads, we follow the basic strategy used by Brader (2006) as well as Albertson and Gadarian (2015): we created political advertise- ments that had an identical script but varied in terms of other audiovisual elements (music and imagery). The audiovisual component is what we use to manipulate the affective content of the advertisement. Creating advertisements suitable for measuring implicit attitudes toward a political candidate presented several additional challenges. One choice we faced was whether to present ads focused on a real or fictional candidate. We opted for a fictional candidate—Mike Harper—because we expected that implicit attitudes about a familiar figure would be more difficult to move (see Gregg, Seibt, and Banaji 2006) and also because focusing on a fictional candidate allowed us to more tightly control aspects of the advertisements to make for a clean test. Our objective in writing a script for our advertise- ment was to fill time with a realistic narration but provide as little actual substantive information rele- vant to a vote choice as possible, thus making experi- mental participants who saw an ad and control group participants who saw no ad as comparable as possible in terms of the information they received about Mike Harper. Reviewing real advertisements provided plenty of examples of pap and pablum to fill this role. We wrote a script—included as SI Section 2—in which Mike Harper offers some bland biographical details— he worked at a hot dog stand in the town where he grew up and believes in hard work—but takes no explicit policy positions. He bemoans dysfunction in Washington but does not blame one political side over the other and does not mention his own partisanship. We found it impossible to scrub script elements that might convey, via stereotypes, some inkling of Har- per’s political leanings, but we were careful to balance elements that might be construed as liberalizing with ones that might be construed as conservatizing. For instance, Harper talks about being a teacher (possibly a liberal stereotype), but he also discusses growing up in a small town and being the son of a war veteran (possibly conservative elements). As we discuss in more detail below, the results of an external manipu- lation check confirm that Harper’s political affinities were ambiguous. To film the ad, we hired a professional videographer and a local actor to play the role of Mike Harper, as well as local university students to serve as “extras.” We spent two days filming scenes around the local commu- nity—outside a local school (ostensibly where Harper works); in a classroom and faculty lounge (also osten- sibly at Harper’s high school); and in an author’s living room, kitchen, and car (all ostensibly Harper’s). We required two acceptable takes of each scene. One take, which was destined for the high-quality ad condition, was shot with professional-grade staging, lighting, and delivery. In the other take, destined for the low-quality ad condition, the actor delivered the identical script, but he was positioned against a neutral background in the same environs (usually a nondescript wall), the lighting was more neutral, and his delivery was drier. Although we use the term “quality” for ease of discussion, we Timothy J. Ryan and Yanna Krupnikov 4Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. University of Glasgow Library, on 14 Aug 2021 at 13:07:57, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055421000538underscore that this refers to the visual components within the video, rather than the video itself (i.e., both were equally clear when viewed). Because, as we note above, implicit attitudes are thought to change through the accumulation of positive associations, we filmed ads that were between four and five minutes long.8 As we discuss below, the tool we use to measure implicit attitudes toward Mike Harper—an Implicit Association Test (IAT)—relies on words and symbols that can be associated with the candidate. For this reason, we were careful to incorporate four suitable IAT stimuli into the ads—and to make them equally prominent in the low-quality and high-quality ad. The four ad elements designed for incorporation into an IAT were (1) Mike Harper’s face, (2) Mike Harper’s name, (3) Mike Harper’s campaign slogan (“Start small, go far”), and (4) Mike Harper’s campaign logo, which prominently features a compass. (In the ad script, Harper says he uses his father’s compass as a campaign logo as a reminder to “stay on course.”) Figure 1 presents still images taken from parallel sections of the low-quality and high-quality ad. We conducted several instrumentation checks on external samples to verify important properties of the ads we filmed. First, because we hoped to isolate the effect of affective content from partisan and ideological considerations, we ensured that Harper’s political lean- ings were ambiguous. Second (and more critical), we ensured that Harper’s political leanings were indistin- guishable, comparing the low-quality ad with the high- quality ad. (Otherwise, treatment effects would be confounded with something about music and imagery that conveyed political leanings.) Third, we ensured that low- and high-quality ads were comparable in other important respects: equally memorable, equally realistic, and the features we intended to use in the IAT (the slogan and logo) were remembered equally well. Fourth, we confirmed via a post hoc check that viewers actually experienced differing degrees of positive affect while watching the ads, in accordance with our expectations. The ads passed these checks, and we report the relevant results in the SI (Section 3). For the main study, we incorporated the advertise- ments described above into a survey instrument. Participants—undergraduates who participated for course credit9—began the study by viewing either the low-quality ad, the high-quality ad, or, if randomly assigned to the control condition, no ad at all. Next, participants completed an IAT focused on Mike Har- per. The IAT is a common procedure in which implicit attitudes are measured via participants’ response laten- cies in using keyboard taps to pair target stimuli (items associated with an attitude object of interest, discussed above) with positive and negative words. Across seven blocks, respondents had to pair items related to Mike Harper with either positive words (e.g., joy, love, smile) or negative words (agony, terrible, horrible), with response latencies measured in milliseconds. The order of the pairing (Harper associated first with positive words, or negative) was counterbalanced by a random assignment. The IAT procedure standardly generates a D-score, which is the average response latency (exclud- ing practice rounds) when Harper stimuli are paired with positive words minus the latency when paired with negative words, divided by the pooled standard devi- ation across all trials.10 The IAT standardly measures implicit preference for one target relative to another target, as in Coke versus Pepsi, Democrat versus Republican, or flowers versus insects. Because we did not provide participants with any information about Harper’s political competition, we measured implicit attitudes relative to a neutral target—images of gray shapes. Figure 2 shows the IAT instructions presented to participants.11 Measured this way, D-scores about Mike Harper range from -0.985 to 1.280, are roughly normally distributed, have a mean of 0.263, and a standard deviation of 0.452. Immediately after the IAT, participants reported their explicit attitudes toward Mike Harper by answering the question, “How much did you like Mike Harper, the candidate depicted in the ad?”12 There were seven response options ranging from “Dislike him a great deal” to “Like him a great deal.” We scale responses such that the most negative feelings toward Harper take a value 8 Thus, our ads are considerably longer than traditional 30-second television spots. We considered this feature necessary to deliver a sufficient dose of emotional content. Real advertisers accomplish as much by repeating ads multiple times over days or weeks, but doing so was not practical within our design. We must leave questions related to dosage timing—a short ad repeated many times versus a long ad delivered once—for future studies. As concerns naturalism, however, we note that the new emphasis on online advertising (Fowler et al. 2021) affords campaigns much greater leeway as concerns ad length (Borah, Fowler, and Ridout 2018; Ridout et al. 2015). We examined the distribution of advertisement length in a newly compiled dataset of political advertisements run by candidates for federal office, including President, on Facebook and YouTube in 2020. We found that approximately 26% of Facebook advertisements and 35% of YouTube advertisements are more than 30 seconds long. To this point, our rough model for the video, in terms of feel and style, was a biographical video produced by Senator Ben Sasse, titled “The Outsider,” which is nearly six minutes long. Further, in a study of YouTube campaign advertising, Ridout et al. (2015) find “no linear relationship between ad length and viewership; viewers appear not to be turned off by long videos” (245). We thank Laura Baum and Erika Franklin Fowler for providing us with data on online advertisement length in the 2020 campaign. 9 We agree with Druckman and Kam’s(2011) assessment that stu- dents represent a useful data source—especially for studies, like ours, where the objective is to understand psychological mechanisms rather than to estimate averages in some larger population (such as the United States). This said, Studies 2 and 3b below use nonstudent samples, and Section 6 of the SI tests for possible heterogeneous effects. 10 As is standard, we exclude from analysis 3.7% of respondents (n = 17) who appear to be “button-mashing”—they had more than 10% IAT trials that were implausibly fast (faster than 300ms). 11 Because respondents randomly assigned to the control group had no exposure to Mike Harper before the IAT, their instructions included the following sentence: “In this IAT, one of the categories is ‘Images related to Mike Harper,’ a candidate for public office. Images related to Mike Harper are displayed below.” 12 For the control group, this question was, “Without knowing much about him, how much did you like Mike Harper, the candidate you saw?” Split Feelings: Understanding Implicit and Explicit Political Persuasion 5Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

After reporting feel- ings toward Harper, participants reported perceptions of his political leanings (ideology and partisanship)13 and FIGURE 1.

Scaled from 0 = “extremely liberal” to 1 = “extremely conservative,” Harper’s ideol- ogy was indistinguishable in the control condition (M = 0.545, SE = 0.017) compared with both the low-quality condition (M = 0.553, SE = 0.017) and the high-quality condition (M = 0.535, SE = 0.017, ns). Similarly, the random assignment had no influence on his perceived party affiliation. Respondents guessed whether they sup- posed Harper was a Democrat or a Republican or reported that they didn’t know what party he belonged to.

Two weeks after the initial survey instrument, all participants were invited to complete a follow-up questionnaire—also for course credit. This follow-up questionnaire was much shorter: it simply administered the IAT and explicit liking measures a second time, testing the durability of any effects. Both waves were required for course credit, and attrition from Wave 1 to Wave 2 was low: 94% of participants who completed Wave 1 also completed Wave 2.

Results. Our primary interest is in how the random assignment influenced implicit and explicit liking of Mike Harper. Figure 3 presents the main results, which are broken down by implicit and explicit measures, as well as survey wave. In Wave 1, the high-quality ad improved explicit attitudes relative to the control (p < 0.001), but the low-quality ad was indistinguishable from the control (p = 0.78). Both ads improved implicit attitudes relative to the control (p < 0.01 for both contrasts). But the low-quality ad was not distinguish- able from the high-quality ad (p = 0.92). By Wave 2, the effects for explicit attitudes had become more muted, though the high-quality advertisement was still distin- guishable from control (p < 0.02). In Wave 2, no implicit attitude contrasts were statistically significant. Discussion. This pattern of results does not conform to the preregistered expectations we derived from the APE Model. We predicted no strong effects on explicit attitudes, as the ad provided little substantive informa- tion (and identical substantive information in compar- ing the low- to the high-quality ad). But the high-quality ad substantially improved explicit attitudes. Moreover, although our prediction that the low-quality ad would improve implicit attitudes relative to the control was supported, we also predicted that the high-quality ad would improve implicit attitudes relative to the low- quality ad—a result that did not occur. Although the APE model was not supported, this test has an important result that underlines the promise in studying implicit attitudes: the treatment conditions moved implicit and explicit attitudes separately. We see this in contrasting the low-quality ad with the control, where implicit attitudes are improved while explicit attitudes remain unchanged. We see the result again in contrasting the high-quality ad to the low-quality ad, as explicit attitudes are improved while implicit atti- tudes remain essentially unchanged. Thus, we find two clear examples of implicit/explicit attitude dissociation and evidence that the two types of psychological orien- tations change in response to different influences. A third sign of implicit/explicit attitude dissociation is the greater durability of treatment effects on explicit atti- tudes that can be seen via the right-hand column. This result is a possible hint that political appeals targeting implicit attitudes require repetition to stick—a point to which we return in our concluding section. AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE APE MODEL: MERE EXPOSURE EFFECTS After Study 1, we conducted a second test of the APE Model. The advertisement conditions above were crossed with a text-based manipulation providing facts about Mike Harper—an effort to separately manipu- late propositional and associational processing FIGURE 3. Treatment Effects on Explicit and Implicit Attitudes, Study 1 Note: Explicit attitudes are scaled from 0 = disliking Mike Harper to 1 = liking Harper. Implicit attitudes range from -0.985 to 1.280 in Wave 1 and -0.886 to 1.288 in Wave 2. For implicit attitudes, negative scores reflect implicit dislike of Harper, and positive scores reflect implicit liking. Whiskers represent 95% confidence intervals. Timothy J.

We drew participants from Amazon Mech- anical Turk (MTurk), providing some ability to extrapolate beyond the university students.15 Once again, preregistered expectations derived from the APE Model were not supported. We report this study (Study 2) fully in the SI. Looking across these two studies, we noticed a pat- tern: exposure to any advertisement about Mike Har- per improved implicit attitudes toward him, relative to a pure control condition (as seen in the bottom-left panel of Figure 3). The same is not true of explicit attitudes. For instance, mere exposure to the low-quality adver- tisement did not move explicit attitudes in Study 1. The pattern for implicit attitudes, we realized, is aptly described by a framework with a long history in social/ cognitive psychology. In a seminal paper, Robert Zajonc (1968) used the term “mere exposure” effects to refer to the tendency for attitudes toward a stimulus to be enhanced whenever the stimulus becomes “accessible to the individual’s perception” (1). Zajonc had in mind patterns such as the tendency to rate fictional words, jagged polygons, and unknown Japanese ideographs more favorably the more times a person has seen them. In the ensuing years, more than 400 studies would docu- ment mere exposure effects in a wide range of contexts (Bornstein and Craver-Lemley 2016), and the principle would become a cornerstone approach in product mar- keting (e.g., Fang, Singh, and Ahluwalia 2007). Mere exposure effects are more than just a recurrent empirical pattern. There are reasons to expect them to emerge more reliably for implicit than explicit atti- tudes. Years after noting the phenomenon, Zajonc explicitly connected it to the two-systems framework that was beginning to take hold in psychology. He argued that raw positive or negative affect emerges from a set of mental processes that is both uncontrol- lable and independent of those associated with effortful thinking. Such attitudes can be enhanced, he thought— even in the absence of information—because certain neurophysiological systems are designed to identify stimuli that, in the past, have not proven to be threat- ening (Zajonc 1980). The two-systems framework also would acquire the status of conventional wisdom in psychology (e.g., Kahneman 2011). For instance, it undergirds Petty and Cacioppo’s elaboration likeli- hood model of persuasion, which describes a peripheral route to persuasion in which attitudes change “without necessitating scrutiny of the true merits of the informa- tion presented” (1986, 125). These insights gave us license to posit that the impli- cit attitude patterns we have presented so far are not quirks but instances of a simple familiarity induction having an effect right where Zajonc might have pre- dicted: in the raw positive and negative associations measured by the IAT. We designed Study 3 as a more focused test of this idea. STUDIES 3A AND 3B: DOES MERE EXPOSURE IMPROVE IMPLICIT ATTITUDES? Although the results in Studies 1 and 2 are consistent with an effect of mere exposure on implicit attitudes, they are not an especially demanding test of this idea. Their chief limitation is that, although the advertise- ments we created were thin on substantive information, it was all but impossible to create realistic advertise- ments that provided no information whatsoever. So, what looks like a mere exposure effect could instead be attributable (for instance) to participants learning that Mike Harper is a teacher. Thus, Studies 3a and 3b introduce a pure manipulation of candidate familiarity, with the objective of comparing how familiarity affects implicit and explicit attitudes. Procedure. Study 3a assesses how attitudes toward Mike Harper differ, depending on whether participants have been induced to become familiar with him. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of several induction conditions, described next. Then, the survey measured their implicit and explicit attitudes toward Mike Harper. Because we measure attitudes about Mike Harper irrespective of the random assignment, we refer to Harper as the target candidate. Study 3a had three conditions: a target induction, a nontarget induction, and a control condition. In the control condition, the protocol measured attitudes toward Mike Harper immediately after the study’s consent screen. In the target induction condition, par- ticipants underwent a procedure to induce familiarity with Mike Harper before attitude measurement. In the nontarget induction condition, participants were induced to become familiar with “Paul Coleman,” a fictional candidate similar to Harper in terms of race, gender, and age. The purpose of the nontarget induc- tion is to provide a more conservative comparison point than the pure control. For instance, this condition allows us to assess whether it is familiarity with Harper in particular (as opposed to, e.g., “politicians” or “white men”) that affects attitudes toward him. Study 3b was identical to Study 3a, but added a fourth condition: we induced some participants to become familiar with a woman nontarget candidate (“Paula Coleman”). The purpose of this condition was to better understand the extent to which familiarity effects “spill over” onto similar attitude objects. For instance, familiarity with Paul Coleman might improve attitudes toward Mike Harper, as both are white men of a similar age.16 Adding a comparison point that is more dissimilar to Mike Harper than Paul Coleman helps to assess this possibility. We chose to create a more dissimilar candidate by modifying can- didate gender because, as a matter of social cognition, another person’s gender is encoded automatically 15 MTurk is a crowdsourcing service where human participants com- plete tasks for small payments. See Coppock (2019) and Coppock, Leeper, and Mullinix (2018) on the generalizability of studies con- ducted on MTurk. 16 As can be seen in the bottom-left panel of Figure 5, the initial run of this study generated suggestive evidence of such a spillover effect, which is part of what motivated us to develop an additional treatment arm. We thank our peer reviewers for encouraging us to explore spillover effects more fully. Split Feelings: Understanding Implicit and Explicit Political Persuasion 9Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. University of Glasgow Library, on 14 Aug 2021 at 13:07:57, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055421000538 (Stangor et al. 1992). If implicit attitudes toward Mike Harper benefit from induced familiarity with Paul Coleman because the two individuals are similar, this pattern should be attenuated by changing Coleman to be a woman. The familiarity induction sought to increase familiar- ity with the candidate without providing any substan- tive information about him or her. We asked participants to rate still photographs of the induction candidate, to guess the candidate’s age, and to report whether a variety of adjectives (intelligent, hard-work- ing, wealthy, competent) describe the candidate well. (Responses to these questions, of course, could only be hunches based on the still photographs.) Familiarity was further induced through a “typing test” that asked participants to type the candidate’s name five times. We also presented the candidate’s slogan (“Start Small, Go Far” for Harper or “Let’s Get Things Done” for Coleman) and asked whether the slogan is difficult to say out loud. Of course, the real purpose of this ques- tion was to induce the participants to say the slogan out loud. The images used in the induction are presented in Figure 4. After the induction, the study measured implicit and explicit attitudes in the same way as for the previous two studies. Again, all conditions measured attitudes toward our target candidate, Mike Harper, thereby positioning us to understand how attitudes toward Harper depend on whether participants became familiar with him, someone else, or nobody at all. Our participants in Study 3a were undergraduates, though this time we were able to conduct the experi- ment at two institutions in different regions. Given that the students underwent identical procedures, we pool the two sets of students together, giving us N = 457.17 In Study 3b, we used a sample that would help us assess the extent to which our conclusions might depend on a participant population—undergraduates—that are homogeneous with respect to age and education. We recruited participants (N = 1,275) via Amazon Mech- anical Turk.18 As we report in the SI, this sample is diverse with respect to age. Additionally, we used an education quota to ensure that at least half our sample FIGURE 4. Images from the Familiarity Induction Nontarget Man Nontarget Woman (3b only) Target 17 In Study 3a, our statistical model includes a dummy variable for each of the two institutions. The new institution (University B) we incorporated into Study 3a has a high percentage of international students, whom we thought might behave differently in this study, given its locus in US politics. The instrument for University B included one additional question asking whether the respondent was an international student, and the analyses below follow a pre- registered plan to exclude international respondents. However, results including international students are nearly identical. (We report these results in SI Section 5.) We also exclude 22 respond- ents (5%) identified as button-mashers by the same standard used in Study 1. 18 Recent research has identified a concerning level of fraudulent responding on MTurk (Kennedy et al. 2020). We preregistered and implemented several extra steps to ensure that the responses we collected would be high quality, and we are confident that these measures were effective. We discuss these steps more fully in SI Section 12. The reported N is the number of respondents left after preregistered exclusions. Timothy J. Ryan and Yanna Krupnikov 10Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Thus, Study 3b provides additional leverage via which to consider possible treatment effect hetero- geneity. We preregistered our expectations for both studies (See SI Section 9 and 10). Results. Figure 5 reports the expected implicit and explicit attitudes toward Mike Harper, coded as in Study 1, as a function of the random assignment. There is no evidence that the inductions affected explicit attitudes in either study. (In Study 3a, the F statistic for the underlying model rounds to zero: F(3, 435) < 0.01, p ≈ 1.0. In Study 3b, F(3, 1163) = 0.41, p = 0.75. No pairwise comparisons between conditions are statistic- ally distinguishable.) This is a predicted null result.19 However, familiarity with Mike Harper improves implicit attitudes toward him. In Study 3a, implicit attitudes in the target condition are statistically distin- guishable from the control condition (t = 3.46, p < 0.01), though the contrast against the nontarget condition is only suggestive (t = 1.50, p = 0.14). In Study 3b, the target condition is statistically distinguishable from all others (vs. control, t = 3.07; vs. nontarget male, t = 2.74; vs. nontarget female, t = 2.77; all p < 0.01). Thus, induced familiarity with Harper improves implicit atti- tudes toward him, but induced familiarity with other politicians (including a demographically similar one) does not. Discussion. Studies 3a and 3b make three substantive contributions. First, they provide additional evidence that implicit and explicit attitudes are dissociated. They change via different processes, and one can change without the other: the familiarity induction moves implicit attitudes toward Mike Harper, but effects on explicit attitudes are convincingly null. Second, these studies show that merely increasing familiarity with a political candidate improves implicit attitudes about him—even in the absence of any substantive informa- tion. Third, they suggest that the channel via which familiarity improves implicit attitudes is reasonably encapsulated. Aside from a suggestive result in Study 3a that did not reemerge in 3b, implicit attitudes toward Harper improve in response to familiarity with Harper only.20 In the Supporting Information (Section 5), we report analyses stratified by age and education. We find that some evidence that age and education have direct effects on attitudes (with young and uneducated people having generally less favorable attitudes toward Har- per) but no evidence that these factors moderate treat- ment effects. Such results constitute evidence that the FIGURE 5. Treatment Effects on Explicit and Implicit Attitudes Note: Whiskers represent 95% confidence intervals. In Study 3a, the analysis sample is 439 for explicit attitudes and 417 for implicit attitudes. In Study 3b, the sample size is 1,167 for explicit attitudes and 1,114 for implicit attitudes. 19 Per our preregistration for Study 3b: “We do not hypothesize any effects on explicit attitudes about Mike Harper.” 20 We acknowledge that much more work must be done to under- stand just how encapsulated this channel is, but must leave that to future research. Split Feelings: Understanding Implicit and Explicit Political Persuasion 11Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. University of Glasgow Library, on 14 Aug 2021 at 13:07:57, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055421000538 effects we identify are reasonably homogeneous and likely apply well across demographic groups (see Cop- pock, Leeper, and Mullinix 2018). While we think that this demonstration of mere exposure effects is instructive for the study of political messaging—we return to this below—we recognize that Studies 3a and 3b necessitated some trade-offs. To isolate the effects of familiarity, we manipulated the concept in an unnaturalistic way. Furthermore, because we excised substantive information from the study entirely, we lost the ability to examine how familiarity effects might depend on the provision of substantive information. Thus, Study 4 seeks to reintroduce a substantive messaging. This inclusion allows us to test some limits of mere exposure effects as well as to offer a fuller assessment of the APE Model in the context of political communication. STUDY 4: HOW DO SUBSTANTIVE AND NONSUBSTANTIVE MESSAGING ELEMENTS INTERACT? Study 4 returns to, and builds on, the general approach used in Study 1. Participants are exposed to the same three advertisement conditions (high-quality ad, low-quality ad, or no ad). However, this assignment is fully crossed with a separate assignment that manipu- lates the substantive information participants have about Mike Harper: they are told he was implicated in a political scandal or they are given neutral informa- tion. This procedure is similar to Study 2 (in the SI), though we made some operational improvements and filed a separate preregistration to reflect our develop- ing theoretical understanding. Procedure. After viewing one of the ads used in Study 1, we asked all participants to report, in open- ended format, what they typically eat for breakfast—a small distractor task to serve as a buffer between survey sections. Next, respondents were randomly assigned to read one of the two news stories presented in Figure 6. As the figure shows, one clipping was a nonpolitical control story about cheese pastry making. The other story, the scandal story, reveals that Mike Harper was implicated in serious misconduct. Three aspects of the scandal story bear some emphasis. First, the story is plain text—a medium far less rich in affective content than our audio/visual advertisements. Second, the story is parsimonious— just 153 words. Third, the allegations levied against Harper are conclusive. We wanted to leave little doubt that positive characteristics one might have ascribed to FIGURE 6. News Stories Used in Study 4 Control Story Scandal Story Timothy J. Ryan and Yanna Krupnikov 12Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Fourth, we chose an allegation (embezzling funds) that, although conclusively bad, we expected to be less affect-laden than plausible alternatives. (For instance, we decided against revealing evidence of sexual assault.) Thus, while the video advertisements are tailored to target associational mental processes, the news story is suited to target propositional mental processes. From the standpoint of the APE Model, the advertisement manipulation should lead to changes in implicit atti- tudes, whereas the scandal story should lead to changes in explicit attitudes.21 However, given the results we describe above, our preregistered predictions explicitly departed from the APE. Most importantly, for participants assigned to the control story, we predicted a mere exposure effect: ad exposure should improve implicit attitudes toward Mike Harper. At the same time, because Studies 1 and 2 revealed several instances where stimuli intended to target explicit attitudes nonetheless affected implicit atti- tudes, we predicted that the scandal manipulation would harm implicit (not just explicit) attitudes about Harper— and indeed might neutralize mere familiarity effects. Once again, experiment participants were undergradu- ates at two institutions. One of the two institutions expanded the research participation requirement applied to undergraduates, resulting in a considerably larger sample size. As in Study 3, we follow a preregistered plan to exclude international students from one of the partici- pating institutions, resulting in a useable N of 1,104.22 Results. A between-subjects ANOVA reveals signifi- cant effects for both manipulations.23 Of course, our main interest is in the interdependence between the two random assignments. Thus, Figure 7 shows expected implicit and explicit attitudes for the six pos- sible assignments.24 Clearly, a tidy framework in which each kind of attitude (implicit and explicit) is affected via a different route is not supported. For instance, the ad quality manipulation is, according to the APE, better suited to influence implicit attitudes. But the high-quality ad significantly improved explicit atti- tudes—compared with control and low-quality condi- tions, and irrespective of the scandal condition (all p < 0.01). Moreover, the scandal manipulation is, again according to the APE, better suited to influence explicit attitudes. But the scandal story had a significant nega- tive effect on implicit attitudes in two of the three ad conditions (p < 0.01, p = 0.17, p < 0.01). Thus, both manipulations affected attitudes in both domains. On the other hand, the results are generally consist- ent with a mere exposure effect for implicit attitudes. In the control condition, exposure to any advertisement (low- and high-quality assignments pooled) improved implicit attitudes (p < 0.02), though as the figure shows this effect was driven more by the high-quality assign- ment (p < 0.01 compared with control) than the low- quality assignment (p = 0.15). In the scandal condition, exposure to any advertisement improved implicit atti- tudes (p < 0.02), though here the effect was driven more by the low-quality ad (p < 0.02 compared with control) than the high-quality ad (p = 0.10). No high-quality versus low-quality contrasts were significant for implicit attitudes. Discussion. Study 4 does not support the APE Model. However, it does accumulate further evidence that mere exposure to an attitude object improves implicit attitudes. Interestingly, mere exposure effects emerge irrespective of the scandal condition. (As our preregistration reflects, we thought the scandal condi- tion might neutralize mere exposure effects.) More generally, Study 4 provides additional examples of implicit/explicit attitude dissociation. For instance, among respondents assigned to the scandal condition, a shift from a low-quality to a high-quality ad signifi- cantly improves explicit attitudes (p < 0.01) but has a (nonsignificant) negative effect on implicit attitudes (p = 0.36). Although our primary focus lies in comparing implicit and explicit attitudes, the explicit attitude results in Study 4 bear some discussion in their own right. The scandal story had a large negative effect on respondents who saw no ad (difference = −0.22, SE = 0.018, p < 0.0001). But the scandal/control contrast is comparatively muted among respondents who saw either the low- or high-quality ads.25 In this sense, both ads served to inoculate Mike Harper from the negative effects of a scandal. Although we are cautious about post hoc speculation for why this result occurred, positive ads (such as those in this 21 To see how this prediction relates to dual-process models of attitude change, consider that Gregg, Seibt, and Banaji write that “Entertaining the idea, out of the blue, that a novel object is X or ~X or that an existing object known to be X is in fact ~X (or vice versa)” is a quintessential example of an occurrence that should affect propos- itional (or abstract) processes and therefore induce sharp explicit attitude change (2006, 4). Our instrumentation is very much motiv- ated by Gregg, Seibt, and Banaji’s Study 3, which proceeded as follows: the authors induced positive or negative attitudes toward fictional social groups (Niffites and Luupites) via an association- based priming task in which one group was consistently paired with positive or negative traits (e.g., benevolent or barbaric). Then, in an effort to influence propositional processes, some subjects were informed that, due to a clerical error, the positive and negative traits were associated with the opposite of the intended group. As the APE Model would predict, this treatment induced a change in explicit— but not implicit—attitudes. For a political science study that has several similar design elements, see Groenendyk (2019). 22 Results including the 104 excluded international students are nearly identical. Similar to previous studies, 76 respondents (7%) are excluded for button-mashing through the IAT. 23 For explicit attitudes, Fad(2, 1001) = 44.32, p < 0.001; FScandal(1, 1002) = 63.99 p < 0.001. For implicit attitudes, Fad(2, 1025) = 6.35, p < 0.002; FScandal(1, 1025)= 21.78, p < 0.001. 24 The underlying model is Attitude = α þ β1-3(Low-quality \u0002 Scandal interactions) þ β4-5*(Low-quality \u0002 Scandal interactions) þ β6*Institution þ ε. 25 In the low-quality condition, difference = −0.035, SE = 0.027, p = 0.19. For the high-quality condition, difference = −0.071, SE = 0.026, p < 0.001. The effect sizes in both advertisement conditions are distinguishable from the effect size in the no ad condition. For the relevant interaction terms, βLow-quality \u0002 Scandal = 0.190, SE = 0.033, p < 0.001; βHigh-quality \u0002 Scandal = 0.154, SE = 0.033, p < 0.01. However, effect sizes in the two ad conditions are not distinguishable from each other. For the relevant interaction, β = −0.036, SE = 0.037, p = 0.34. Split Feelings: Understanding Implicit and Explicit Political Persuasion 13Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Moreover, the combination of the positive ad with the negative story of the scandal may have led the participants to weigh both more care- fully, affecting explicit evaluations (Chong and Druckman 2007b). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Zajonc’s landmark essay laying out the case for distinct mental systems governing cognition and affect contains a passage worth quoting at length: The dismal failure in achieving substantial attitude change through various forms of communication or persuasion is another indication that affect is fairly independent and often impervious to cognition… . If a person believes that Candidate A is honest, we can simply give the person information proving that A is not honest… . Yet this approach has been the least successful in attitude change. Even the most convincing arguments on the merits of spinach won’t reduce a child’s aversion to this vegetable. (Zajonc 1980, 158–59) Quite. Zajonc’s words represent an insight the broad strokes of which political psychologists have partly embraced, such as in studies that emphasize the para- mount influence of social identities (e.g., Huddy, Mason, and Aarøe 2015) or citizens’ motivations to bring political judgments in line with gut reactions (e.g., Lodge and Taber 2013). But as concerns attitude change, the field still has some ways to go. As we note at the outset, there are precious few studies of factors that cause implicit attitudes—arguably the most direct measure of raw affect—to change. And the preemi- nent concept in the study of persuasion—framing effects (e.g., Druckman 2010)—is, at least to the extent it refers to an actor emphasizing different pieces of information relevant to some judgment, entirely cognitive in nature. FIGURE 7. Treatment Effects in Study 4 Note: Whiskers represent 95% confidence intervals. Timothy J. Ryan and Yanna Krupnikov 14Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. University of Glasgow Library, on 14 Aug 2021 at 13:07:57, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055421000538Here, by directly comparing paths for implicit versus explicit attitude change, we have attempted to open a new front in the study of political persuasion. Our studies lead us to three main conclusions. The first conclusion is simple, but bears emphasis. We find that implicit and explicit attitudes are distinct. Over and over again, they respond differently to the treatments we administered, in some cases even seem- ing to move in opposite directions. This result implies that political actors might—knowingly or not—employ different tools to engage in different kinds of persua- sion. Alongside the finding that implicit and explicit attitudes have distinct consequences for behavior (e.g., Albertson 2011; Quillian 2006; Ryan 2017), this con- clusion underlines that the tactics used to influence voters are even more complex and multifaceted than has heretofore been appreciated. Second, we find little evidence that the APE model works as a framework for understanding implicit and explicit attitude change in the context of political com- munication. We word this conclusion narrowly, and we do so because we wish not to be construed as launching a frontal assault on the APE. We regard the evidence that psychology journals have accumulated in the model’s favor as sound, which is why we made it the starting point for our inquiries. We conjecture that the main reason APE falls short in our research pertains to the different priorities that emerge in traditional cog- nitive psychology (APE’s provenance) compared with psychologically informed political science (our focus). Where studies in pure psychology often sacrifice real- ism, the better to isolate and validly manipulate the constructs of interest, political scientists strive to under- stand how psychological principles apply in real com- municative contexts. As an example of how these different priorities can lead to different conclusions, compare our work with one of the studies that informed our understanding of the APE Model. Moran and Bar-Anan (2013) created negative associations with an alien creature by having participants listen to horrified screaming while viewing pictures of the creature on a computer screen. In contrast, our studies attempted to create associations with a candidate via plausible advertisements that var- ied in their production quality. Our manipulation, more than the screams, is susceptible to spilling over to areas not intended. For instance, although our ads intended to provide equivalent information (by having identical narration), perhaps respondents made different sub- stantive inferences about Mike Harper’s competence depending on whether or not they saw a low- or high- quality ad. We acknowledge this possibility. However, we see it not as a mistake, but rather as a data point that illustrates a limitation of the APE: the model does not transition away from a lab and into the field so seamlessly.26 Although we do not corroborate the APE, our stud- ies accumulate evidence for an alternative. Our third conclusion is that political messages can improve impli- cit attitudes simply by increasing familiarity with a target object. This pattern arises in all four studies we conducted, including two (Study 3a and 3b) with a pure familiarity manipulation. To be sure, there is more to learn about this pattern: does it arise when familiarity is induced in a negative way (such as an attack ad)? How does the magnitude and perseverance of the effect relate to the treatment dosage? And what interventions beyond familiarity successfully move implicit attitudes? (Because we have found one route does not preclude the existence of others.) Although we must leave these questions to future studies, the familiarity patterns we discuss above already help elucidate real political phenomena. We close with two examples. Low-information campaign tools. Scholars have long noticed that politicians seek to influence voters with messages that convey little or no substantive information. Long-standing examples include lawn signs, billboards, placards, and vacuous television spots. Many ads on modern advertising platforms— Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram, for instance— undoubtedly fit the bill, too (e.g., Fowler et al. 2021). The most common explanations for such efforts are almost entirely cognitive in nature:27 These ads can build name recognition, which is electorally beneficial (e.g., Abramowitz 1975; Levy and Squire 2000; Makse, Minkoff, and Sohkey 2019). Or, they might influence thoughts about a candidate’s viability, incumbency, or experience (e.g., Green et al. 2016; Krasno 1997). Our results suggest that something as simple as a lawn sign may have effects that are more powerful than a purely cognitive model would predict: familiarity with a candidate can affect implicit (but not necessarily explicit) attitudes without necessarily changing cognitions about him or her. Note that a result we saw in Study 1—the greater decay of treat- ment effects on implicit attitudes after a delay of two weeks—fits in well with this literature. Because impli- cit attitude change stems from changing positive and negative associations with an attitude object, it unfolds in a more cumulative and incremental way than explicit attitude change does (Gregg, Seibt, and Banaji 2006). Consistent with this, research in com- munication finds that the success of low-information 26 Gawronski and Bodenhausen (2018, 25) have a discussion (“Is the APE Model Falsifiable?”) that is helpful for understanding how the results we report relate to the APE Model. There, the authors acknowledge that the model is difficult to falsify. Per the authors, because the model allows for interactions between associative and propositional processes, it is possible to explain almost any empirical outcome in a post hoc fashion. Thus, we see our studies as falsifying one formulation of the APE—the version that might have been especially revealing as concerns political communication. Other for- mulations can remain, though they would be far more complex and difficult to apply to politics. 27 An important exception is Kam and Zechmeister (2013), who much like us, explicitly contemplate a “direct” effect of familiarity on attitudes. Although these authors examine the effects of implicit (i.e., subliminal) priming, they do not measure implicit attitudes as a dependent variable. Split Feelings: Understanding Implicit and Explicit Political Persuasion 15Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The content of positive versus negative messages. There is considerable evidence that negative political ads are more informative than positive ads. In par- ticular, negative ads tend to contain more information about political issues (Fowler and Ridout 2010;Koch 2008). Why would this be so? The results we present point to one possibility. If negative ads focused pri- marily on positive/negative associations, there are two reasons they might backfire: they might accidentally increase familiarity with the opponent politician or the negative associations might, against intentions, become associated with the sponsoring politician (especially given the legal requirement that the spon- sor verbally approve each ad). For these reasons, negative ads might need to primarily target propos- itional thinking. Positive ads, in contrast focus solely on the sponsoring candidate (often without any men- tion of the opponent), so it is more propitious for them to target associations and, as a result, implicit attitudes. To close, we note that this series of investigations illustrates one underappreciated benefit of the discip- linary trend toward experimental preregistration (Franco, Malhotra, and Simonovits 2014). One com- mon concern about expecting researchers to preregis- ter theoretical expectations is that the requirement might hinder exploratory research or suppress publica- tion of studies with unexpected results (Laitin 2013). Privately, we have even heard some concern that if researchers’ expectations are on-record, they might have even bigger incentives to torture results into alignment. We think these concerns reveal a limited view of preregistration. As Platt (1964) argues, scientific infer- ence is like climbing a many-branched tree. At each fork, empirical tests exclude some paths forward while leaving others open. In this framework, preregistra- tions serve a role similar to a chemist’s lab book. They do not handcuff researchers to any particular theoret- ical view. They simply create a clear record of what ideas a particular test was designed to evaluate. Rather than leading to incentives to hide unexpected results, this record makes it more appealing to lay them bare,asdoing so makesiteasierfor readersto share in the same learning process. It is an approach we found refreshing and hope will continue. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS To view supplementary material for this article, please visit http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0003055421000538.
