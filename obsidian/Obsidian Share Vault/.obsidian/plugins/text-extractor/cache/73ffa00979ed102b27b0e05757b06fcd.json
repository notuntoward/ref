Introduction The large-scale integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into electricity markets, especially wind and solar photovoltaic (PV), has increased the complexity of power system management. The unpredictable and uncontrollable production of electricity from wind and solar PV power has intensified electricity price volatility, as both Maciejowska (2020) and Rai and Nunn (2020) have noted. It has also been claimed that electricity produced from RES tends to reduce day-ahead electricity prices, mainly due to its negligible marginal costs. This impact, also known as the merit-order effect (MOE), introduces undesirable variation and uncertainty that affect the profits of market participants, and lead to the “missing money problem” (Mays, 2021). This may decrease the willingness of flexible generation operators to invest in backup capacity, something which is crucial for relieving grid shortfalls and guaranteeing the reliability of power systems. One of the ways the flexibility of integrated electricity markets can be improved is to reinforce interconnections, a move which can also facilitate the integration of intermittent RES in electricity markets (MacIver et al., 2021). Better electricity interconnections allow surplus electricity from RES to be exchanged and/or electricity consumption demand to be met without resorting to costly flexible generation. However, to avoid congestion JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 2 constraints at interconnections and cross-border price differences, the capacity of such interconnections will need to be massively increased to match the burgeoning capacity of wind and solar PV power. This increased interconnection would also reduce the exposure of market participants to the risks of volatile pricing. Thus, understanding the behaviour of electricity prices and their volatility is crucial for scheduling efficient backup generation, and for devising effective strategies to diversify the generation mix and increase the penetration of renewables. Consequently, accurately assessing the impact of electricity flow on mean day-ahead electricity prices and their volatility is crucial for evaluating the impact of electricity imports and exports on the stability of electricity prices. To undertake an analysis of this kind, this research focused on the Iberian electricity market (also known as MIBEL), more specifically, assessing the behaviour of the day- ahead electricity price in Spain. MIBEL is a well suited as a subject for study, as it is a small electricity market serving two just countries (Spain and Portugal) with similar weather conditions and comparable periods and habits of electricity consumption, although this similarity may also limit the potential benefits of interconnections. In addition, MIBEL’s market is located on a peninsula with only one land border, with France, and with limited prospects for establishing further interconnections. This is because France has a generally aurtarkic electricity market, in which nuclear power is, and will likely remain, the main source of electricity, as recent decisions to extend the operating lifetime of its nuclear power plants confirm. Briefly, MIBEL is located on the periphery of Europe and has a fairly low interconnective capacity with the rest of the European electricity market (Loureiro et al., 2019). Therefore, MIBEL’s market is relatively limited, and its domestic electricity systems are likely to be highly reliant on each other to manage their respective instantaneous electricity demand and supply. Another important characteristic of the Spanish electricity system is that it has one of the largest installed capacities of wind generation in Europe. Furthermore, Spain is one of the European countries with the greatest potential for producing electricity from solar PV and, according to data published in Red Eléctrica de España (REE), the capacity of installed solar PV power surged exponentially in 2020. The main goal of this research is to study the impact of electricity imports and exports (hereafter, inflow and outflow, respectively), and of wind and solar PV power, on the JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 3 Spanish day-ahead electricity price. Although RES have proved to have a downward effect on prices in most electricity markets, it remains unclear how wind and solar PV power influence the mean and volatility of electricity prices on an hourly basis. It is particularly important to make an hour-by-hour analysis as this reduces the unwanted seasonal effects usually observed in electricity price time series. Furthermore, electricity consumption curves are not smooth but exhibit peaks and valleys throughout the day. To understand how electricity prices are adjusted to maintain equilibrium between varying levels of electricity supply and consumption, a more detailed analysis is required. Therefore, in this study, each hour was analysed individually from 1 May 2015 to 31 December 2020. To model the data, a combination of a Seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average approach with exogenous regressors (SARMAX) was used in conjunction with a Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. The research sought to answer the following questions: (i) is the electricity produced from wind and solar PV power causing an MOE?; (ii) is this phenomenon occurring at all hours of the day?; (iii) what are the impacts of electricity flows on the day-ahead electricity price?; and (iv) is this price’s volatility positively or negatively influenced by intermittent RES and electricity flows? The contribution of this study to the literature is twofold. First, it provides an analysis of the impact of wind and solar PV power on electricity prices on an hour-by-hour basis, giving invaluable insights into how the magnitude of the MOE changes throughout the day. This variability is significant because it may change the generation mix during the day and lead to additional costs for producers. The study’s second main contribution is its detailed assessment of the impact of electricity flows within the Spanish electricity system on the day-ahead electricity price. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a comprehensive analysis of the role of electricity flows in the electricity system in Spain. The valuable insights this analysis provides can help policymakers to devise policies that maximise the benefits of interconnections in future investments. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review; Section 3 contains a brief description of MIBEL; Section 4 presents the data; Section 5 describes the method; Section 6 analyses and discusses the empirical findings; and Section 7 concludes. 2. Literature Review JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 4 The design and structure of electricity markets have undergone a complete overhaul in recent years. Evidence from several studies has demonstrated that the increase in electricity produced from intermittent RES has lowered day-ahead electricity price in most electricity markets (e.g. Ketterer (2014), Cludius et al. (2014), Woo et al. (2016) and Sapio (2019)). However, the magnitude of the impact of wind and solar PV power, on prices and whether or not it reduces them, depend on the particular characteristics of each electricity mix, and the specific dynamics of electricity consumption, as Würzburg et al. (2013) suggest. This literature review summarises recent findings on both the MOE and the volatility of day-ahead electricity prices in several electricity markets with different generation mixes. Studies of the MOE commonly assess different periods of time using daily and/or hourly time series. Using hourly data, Sorknæs et al. (2019) confirmed the MOE of wind and solar PV power on Danish electricity prices. The authors concluded that the MOE is likely to be reduced as transmission capacities become more congested in Denmark. Despite not focusing on daily or hourly data, Unger et al. (2017) studied the impact of monthly average electricity generation from RES on Finish (FI) and Danish (DK1) electricity prices. The authors confirmed the MOE of RES in both these bidding zones and suggested that exchanging electricity tended to make electricity systems susceptible to higher electricity prices, especially for systems that are net importers. In the literature, other authors have emphasised that the MOE may vary in magnitude throughout the day. By assessing the MOE of wind and solar PV on an hourly basis, Benhmad and Percebois (2018) concluded that, in Germany, the MOE does vary in magnitude throughout the 24 hours of the day. Indeed, the study of Lagarde and Lantz (2018) highlighted that the higher electricity prices are in Germany, the higher the MOE and volatility in electricity prices. Conversely, in some other countries, the MOE was found to be negligible or even non-existent. For instance, an analysis of hourly data in the Czech Republic found no evidence of the MOE from solar PV power (Luňáčková et al., 2017), and in a study of Slovakia (Janda, 2018), it was negligible. These conclusions can be explained in part by the low intensity of solar radiation in both countries, and the prominent role of nuclear power in Slovakia. The literature shows that electricity produced from wind and solar PV power tends to cause a sharp decline in electricity prices but increases their volatility. Using hourly data, Rintamäki et al. (2017) concluded that the electricity produced from wind power had JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 5 different impacts on the volatility of Danish and German electricity prices. In Denmark, wind power actually decreased the volatility of electricity prices, mainly because the electricity produced from wind power tends to be evenly distributed throughout the day. Conversely, in Germany, volatility was increased by wind powered generation because it is higher in off-peak hours. Kyritsis et al. (2017) also confirmed this phenomenon for Germany, but noted that solar PV power decreased volatility in electricity prices, mainly because conventional power plants with costly marginal costs were displaced from the supply curve. Hydropower seems to reduce electricity price volatility in Spain, while wind power increases it (Pereira et al., 2017). Given that electricity produced from hydropower has low marginal costs, it is an appropriate energy source to back up other intermittent renewable energy sources from both an economic and operational perspective. Stable regulatory policy environments with market-based measures that promote greater competition in the integration of RES, are also likely to reduce the volatility of electricity prices (Ciarreta et al., 2020). Gerres et al. (2019) argue that remuneration mechanisms and policies should acknowledge the uncertainties of electricity markets and ensure a certain revenue for market participants. The Danish electricity system has invested heavily in maintenance to counter the adverse effects of the production cycling that arises from wind power. For this reason, Fogelberg and Lazarczyk (2017) concluded that, in the short run, the high variability of wind power had no substantial effect on the risk of failure by other electricity generators. Boosting the capacity of interconnections seems to positively impact the integration of RES into electricity markets (Mac Domhnaill and Ryan, 2020), and tends to produce a convergence in electricity prices (Unger et al., 2018). The reliability of electricity systems is found to increase with rises in interconnection capacity, although the robustness of the overall electricity market decreases (Beyza et al., 2020). For instance, a disturbance in one of the market areas is likely to spread to the others. Large scale cross-border electricity trading would probably play a significant role in clearing up domestic electricity prices (Keles et al., 2020). However, it should also be noted that high levels of electricity produced from RES could result in transmission congestion issues. Goop et al. (2017) suggested that higher levels of solar power generation may increase transmission congestion in European grids. The authors recommend that solar power generation should be carefully considered in scheduling electricity transmission. JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 6 The implications of over- or under-forecasting the electricity produced from RES have also been the subject of research. Wind power forecasting errors seem to increase electricity price spreads every year in the Nordic electricity market, especially in areas with high levels of wind power generation. This was confirmed by Spodniak et al. (2021), who also highlighted the importance of electricity markets operating in real-time markets. Considering the case of the New-England power system, Martinez-Anido et al. (2016) concluded that electricity prices increase when the electricity produced from wind power is over forecasted, and decrease when under-forecasted. The high volatility generally observed in electricity price time series would, thus, be reduced if forecasting errors for wind and solar generation could be minimised, as Gürtler and Paulsen (2018) suggest with respect to Germany. The redesign of electricity markets also implies the phasing-out of polluting and inflexible energy sources. Electricity produced from coal plays a prominent role in the secured electricity capacity of Germany. As a result, the decommissioning of coal power plants is likely to reduce the security of electricity supply in Germany, as confirmed by Keles and Yilmaz (2020). The authors suggest that, to ensure that the generation structure of the country is adequate, massive investments should be made in gas-powered plants and the expansion of transmission grids. In 2018, the maximum available capacity of both nuclear and conventional power would not have been able to satisfy electricity demand in Germany without the electricity produced from wind and solar PV power (for 424 hours) (Kolb et al., 2020). This situation is a consequence of the politically-inspired reduction and phase-out of nuclear and coal power plants. Meanwhile, in France, increased electricity consumption in peak hours is challenging the flexibility of the electricity system, and may lead to the decommissioning of nuclear power plants (Pereira and Marques, 2020). In summary, the MOE is not only causing imbalances in electricity systems, but may also constitute a barrier to achieving an electricity market powered 100% by RES. Low electricity prices may result in a negligible or even negative return on capital for RES producers (Djørup et al., 2018) so that the market value of wind and solar PV power would most likely be reduced (Zipp, 2017). In the literature, it is possible to identify several studies concerning the MOE, some of which looked at MIBEL (e.g. Figueiredo and Silva (2019) who studied the Iberian market as a whole, and Macedo et al. (2020) who assessed the Portuguese case). However, hour-by-hour analysis is relatively rare, JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 7 and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the impact of wind and solar PV power, as well as electricity flow on both the mean and volatility of the Spanish day-ahead electricity price in each hour individually. This kind of analysis is of considerable importance as it makes it possible to distinguish the behaviour of electricity prices in periods of high or low electricity production from wind or solar PV power. Furthermore, this study also assesses the roles of electricity inflow and outflow, which have rarely been studied in the literature. Consequently, this research will provide meaningful insights into the causes of imbalances, and the role of electricity exchange in the Spanish electricity system. 3. The Iberian Electricity Market The Spanish and Portuguese electricity systems established the Iberian electricity market, also known as MIBEL, in 2007. MIBEL has two divisions that operate with distinct functions: the OMIE (Operador del Mercado Ibérico de Energia Español) and the OMIP (Operador do Mercado Ibérico de Energia Português). The OMIE is the Spanish division, and it is responsible for the management of day-ahead electricity bids, while the Portuguese division, OMIP, handles the exchange of energy derivatives such as futures, swaps and forward contracts. The day-ahead electricity price in MIBEL is usually set to be equal in the Spanish and Portuguese electricity systems. The electricity prices of these two electricity systems generally only diverge in specific circumstances, for instance, when a market splitting mechanism is triggered. Fig. 1 displays the monthly average of the day-ahead electricity price for the Spanish and Portuguese electricity systems. Please note that, in this Figure, we opted to plot the monthly average of electricity prices (rather than an hourly time series, which is highly heteroskedastic) as this makes divergences in the electricity prices of the two systems much easier to discern. JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 8 Fig. 1. Monthly average of the day-ahead electricity price in Spain and Portugal from May 2015 to December 2020. Note: Data source: REE – ESIOS Sistema de Información del Operador del Sistema. Graph by the authors Fig.1 shows that the electricity price times series for Spain and Portugal correspond closely for most of the period, and that episodes of market splitting are relatively rare (one example is discernible in the circled area between 2017 and 2018). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the market coupling of the Portuguese and Spanish electricity systems has led to the convergence of day-ahead electricity prices. To understand why electricity prices remained so closely aligned during the period studied, it should be remembered that Spain and Portugal have roughly similar patterns of electricity production and consumption habits. Therefore, it is unsurprising that any increase in electricity production and/or consumption in Spain, tended to be simultaneously observed in Portugal. One strategy used to balance the MIBEL system, avoid market failures and/or relieve the impact of increased residential demand on the electricity market, is the importing or exporting of electricity. However, according to the Spanish Electricity System Report, less than 2.7% of Spain’s electricity demand was satisfied by imported electricity in 2019. In that same year, electricity produced from combined-cycle power satisfied demand nearly by 20.1% (compared to 10.2% in 2018) while the contribution of coal sources decreased to 4.2% (compared to 13.5% in 2018). Wind provided 20.9% of electricity demand while the highest input, covering 22%, came from nuclear power. The capacity of cross-border interconnections is still somewhat limited in MIBEL, and thus, this market is relatively small. Consequently, there are limited opportunities to JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 9 benefit from economies of scale (such as sharing backup capacity and/or exchanging surplus electricity from RES). However, despite these limitations, the convergence of Spanish and Portuguese electricity prices appears to show that MIBEL’s market is increasingly integrated, and capable of efficiently managing instantaneous electricity supply and demand. To verify this and establish more robust conclusions, we undertook an analysis of the impact of electricity flow on mean Spanish day-ahead electricity prices and their volatility. 4. Data Analysis This paper used high-frequency hourly data from the Spanish electricity system and each hour is studied individually (hence 24 models were estimated). Studying each hour individually created a framework that significantly reduced both strong seasonality, and any autocorrelation in the estimations. Strong autocorrelation was not anticipated in this analysis for two main reasons. Firstly, in this empirical analysis it was assumed that there were no interrelations between the independent variables. The electricity produced from wind power and solar PV is highly intermittent and unpredictable, so it is unnecessary to consider its relationship with other explanatory variables (such as electricity consumption or electricity inflow and outflow). Secondly, , as the MOE is assessed in each hour individually, bids for the day-ahead electricity price at 1 a.m. of day 𝑑𝑑are not submitted at the same time as bids for 1 a.m. of day 𝑑𝑑 − 1, for instance. This method of assessing the MOE meant the possibility of strong autocorrelation in the wholesale electricity price time series was greatly reduced. The data originated from the REE – ESIOS Sistema de Información del Operador del Sistema and the timespan studied was from 1 May 2015 to 31 December 2020. All available data for the period was studied, totalling 2,072 observations for each of the 24- hourly estimations. The database included the day-ahead electricity price (PRICE, €/MWh); the forecast consumption of electricity (CONS, MWh); the forecast electricity production from wind power (WIND, MWh); the forecast of electricity production from solar PV power (SOLAR, MWh); electricity inflow (INFLOW, MWh); and electricity outflow (OUTFLOW, MWh). The inflow and outflow variables measure the electricity flow exchanged between Spain and its interconnected electricity systems, namely: Portugal, France, Morocco, and Andorra. JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 10 Fig.2 displays the plots of the day-ahead electricity price time series for each of the 24-hours of the day. JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 11 Fig. 2. Logarithmic electricity price series for each hour of the day Note: Data source: REE – ESIOS Sistema de Información del Operador del Sistema. Graph by the authors. The shape of the electricity price time series graphs is quite similar for all 24 hours of the day, suggesting comparable annual seasonality. There is also a noticeable increase in heteroskedasticity between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. when the Spanish electricity system becomes more dynamic, mainly due to increased electricity consumption. In addition to being influenced by its own daily habits and electricity generation behaviour, the day- ahead electricity price in Spain is also affected by the patterns of electricity production and consumption in the other electricity systems it is connected to. Therefore, it was thought that cross-border flows of electricity flow may play a significant role in determining domestic electricity prices, and their volatility. 4.1. Descriptive statistics Table A.1, in the appendix, presents the descriptive statistics of the variables for each hour of the day. The Jarque-Bera test suggested that the variables did not follow a normal distribution for every hour. The distributions of LPRICE and LINFLOW showed the highest skewed values in most hours (except at 10 p.m.), which means that the variables displayed fat left tails. During the period studied, negative spikes generally occurred in day-ahead electricity prices and in imports. The negative skewed values for the variable LPRICE, may reflect the downward effect of RES on electricity prices. In the case of LINFLOW, the skewed values may indicate that the Spanish electricity system tends to only import small quantities of electricity. Among the other variables, the distributions of LWIND, LSOLAR, LCONS and LOUTFLOW were also negatively skewed, but to a lesser extent than those of LPRICE and LINFLOW. With respect to kurtosis, the variables that had the highest values, and were thus most leptokurtic, were LPRICE and LINFLOW, followed by LOUTFLOW. The distributions of LWIND and LSOLAR were only leptokurtic at certain times of the day when electricity production by these renewable sources was peaking. Finally, for the variable LCONS, kurtosis was below three in most hours, which means it was not leptokurtic. In summary, JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 12 the distribution of the Spanish day-ahead electricity price was found to be highly leptokurtic, with fat left tails. Consequently, the Student-t distribution was assumed in model estimations. 4.2 Unit root tests To assess the stationarity of variables, the Dickey-Fuller Generalised Least Squares (DF-GLS) unit root test, developed by Elliott et al. (1996), was considered appropriate. The DF-GLS is an extension of the well-known Augmented Dickey Fuller (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) unit root test, which has been shown to have better empirical performance under the alternative hypothesis of stationary variables. In view of the obvious levels of heteroskedasticity observed in the studied variables, the DF-GLS unit root test was performed, taking into account heteroskedastic innovations (by using a Wild bootstrap implementation). Table A.2 shows the results of the DF-GLS unit root test with heteroskedastic innovations. The null hypothesis of a unit root was rejected for most hours, meaning that the variables were stationary. However, it should be noted that the variables LPRICE and LCONS were integrated of order one for some hours. In fact, the DF-GLS unit root test is unreliable in the presence of structural breaks. As a consequence, the Bai and Perron (2003) test was used to check for structural breaks in the series. The Bai and Perron (2003) test used in this analysis was the Sequential L+1 breaks vs. L, and heterogeneous error distributions were assumed across breaks. The results of this multiple breakpoint test, for all variables in all hours, are displayed in Table A.3. For instance, the results of the sequential test at 1 a.m. for LPRICE illustrate three breakpoints, given that the null hypothesis of there being 0, 1 and 2 breakpoints was rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis of 1, 2 and 3 breakpoints. The results suggested that LPRICE and LCONS each had at least one breakpoint in their series during the period studied. Given this, for coherence, the Zivot and Andrews (1992) (ZA) unit root test was used to ascertain whether the variables were stationary in the presence of one structural break. The null hypothesis of the ZA unit root test is that the variable has a unit root in the presence of one unknown and endogenously estimated structural break. Table A.3 reveals the results of this test, which confirmed the stationary property of the variables in each of the 24 hours. 5. Method JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 13 The expansion of wind and solar PV power has significantly exacerbated the uncertainty of electricity systems, mainly because their production is dependent on climatic conditions, and they have priority of dispatch. This was confirmed by the results of ARCH-LM (Engle, 1982) and Q autocorrelation tests (Ljung and Box, 1978) in which high levels of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation in the day-ahead electricity price time series were found for each of the 24 hours.1 Electricity price time series are commonly characterised by complex idiosyncrasies, such as high volatility, non-linearity and strong patterns of seasonality. Therefore, to model Spanish day-ahead electricity prices, the SARMAX(𝑝𝑝, 𝑞𝑞)(𝑃𝑃, 𝑄𝑄)/GARCH(𝑝𝑝, 𝑞𝑞) method was applied in this study. Please note that, in this research, the 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺(1,1) structure was applied. It should also be mentioned that extreme values observed in the day-ahead electricity price time series were not omitted, as these spikes may actually play an important role in assessing the behaviour of electricity prices in certain situations, such as during surpluses of RES production and/or periods of low electricity consumption. However, spurious observations were corrected by impulse and/or shift dummies. 5.1 SARMAX(𝒑𝒑, 𝒒𝒒)(𝑷𝑷, 𝑸𝑸)/GARCH(𝒑𝒑, 𝒒𝒒) The SARMAX(𝑝𝑝, 𝑞𝑞)(𝑃𝑃, 𝑄𝑄)/GARCH(𝑝𝑝, 𝑞𝑞) is a combination of the GARCH method of Bollerslev (1986) and the Seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average method of Box and Jenkins (1976) with exogenous regressors (SARMAX). The mean equation of the SARMAX(𝑝𝑝, 𝑞𝑞)(𝑃𝑃, 𝑄𝑄)/GARCH(𝑝𝑝, 𝑞𝑞) has the following structure: 𝛺𝛺𝑝𝑝,ℎ(𝐵𝐵)Ϙ𝑃𝑃,ℎ(𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆,ℎ)𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡,ℎ = 𝜇𝜇𝑞𝑞,ℎ(𝐵𝐵)𝜆𝜆𝑄𝑄,ℎ(𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆,ℎ)𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡,ℎ + � 𝜏𝜏𝑙𝑙𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡,𝑙𝑙,ℎ + � 𝜌𝜌 𝑙𝑙𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡,𝑙𝑙,ℎ𝑙𝑙 𝜖𝜖 𝑘𝑘 +𝜃𝜃 + 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡,ℎ 𝑙𝑙 𝜖𝜖 𝑘𝑘 (1) where, 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡,ℎ represents the dependent variable; B is the lag operator where 𝐵𝐵𝑎𝑎𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 = 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡−𝑎𝑎; 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡 is the error term; p and q stand for the lag orders of the GARCH and ARCH components of the model; 𝑘𝑘 represents the information set; 𝜏𝜏 and 𝑋𝑋 are the coefficient and vector of exogenous variables, respectively; ℎ denotes hour; 𝑙𝑙 is the summation index; Ϙ𝑃𝑃 and 𝛺𝛺𝑝𝑝 represent the seasonal and non-seasonal 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 process parameters, respectively; 𝜆𝜆𝑄𝑄 and 𝜇𝜇𝑞𝑞stand for the seasonal and non-seasonal 𝑀𝑀𝐺𝐺 process parameters, respectively; 𝜌𝜌 and 𝐷𝐷 1 Please note that to save space these results are not presented in the paper but are available on request from the authors. JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 14 are the coefficient and vector of dummy variables; 𝑆𝑆 indicates the lag orders included in both the 𝑆𝑆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 and 𝑆𝑆𝑀𝑀𝐺𝐺 processes and 𝜃𝜃 denotes the constant term.2 The specification of 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺(𝑝𝑝) and 𝑀𝑀𝐺𝐺(𝑞𝑞), as well as the 𝑆𝑆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺(𝑃𝑃) and 𝑆𝑆𝑀𝑀𝐺𝐺(𝑄𝑄) lag orders were based on the analysis of the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) correlograms of the Spanish day-ahead electricity price. The correlograms for each hour of the day showed a high peak at first lag. Furthermore, a high peak every seven lags was also discernible in most hours, indicating that Spanish electricity prices were likely to have strong pattern of seasonality. This prompted us to include seasonal autoregressive (𝑆𝑆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺(𝑃𝑃)) and moving average (𝑆𝑆𝑀𝑀𝐺𝐺(𝑄𝑄)) parameters to control for weekly seasonal issues, i.e., 𝑆𝑆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺(7) and 𝑆𝑆𝑀𝑀𝐺𝐺(7). Regarding the expression of the conditional variance of SARMAX(𝑝𝑝, 𝑞𝑞)(𝑃𝑃, 𝑄𝑄)/GARCH(𝑝𝑝, 𝑞𝑞), it can be written as: 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 2= ᴄ + 𝛽𝛽1𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡−1 2 + 𝛼𝛼1𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡−1 2 + ∑ 𝜂𝜂𝑚𝑚𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ∈ 𝑟𝑟 , (2) where, ᴄ is the constant term; 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 and 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 stand for the coefficient parameters; 𝜂𝜂 refers to the coefficient of exogenous variables and 𝑍𝑍 is their vector; the information set and summation index are denoted by 𝑚𝑚 and 𝑟𝑟, respectively. The exogenous variables included in the estimation of all 24 models were: forecast of electricity generation from wind and solar PV power, forecast of electricity consumption, electricity inflow, and electricity outflow. Please note that the variable solar PV power was not included in estimations between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. because its production during this period was zero. The lag order of the ARCH component (also known as the GARCH error parameter) is represented as 𝛼𝛼1, and it measures the influence of a new shock in a time series, irrespective of its direction. High coefficient values of 𝛼𝛼1 mean that electricity volatility is likely to be substantially increased by unexpected shocks in electricity prices. The dependency of future volatility on past shocks is measured by the GARCH lag component, represented as 𝛽𝛽1 . Future volatility is likely to be significantly affected by past volatility when the coefficient values of 𝛽𝛽1 are high. Conversely, when its coefficient values are low, the behaviour of future volatility is less likely to be driven by past shocks. Finally, the persistence of volatility is classified as high when 𝛼𝛼1+ 𝛽𝛽1 ≅ 1, which means that a shock usually reverts slowly. In turn, when the results meet the condition of 𝛼𝛼1+ 2 Please note that a more detailed description of equation (1) can be found in Papaioannou et al. (2018). JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 15 𝛽𝛽1 ≪ 1, volatility persistence is considered low, and it suggests that a shock is likely to die away quickly. The overall stability of SARMAX/GARCH models is ensured when the sum of GARCH and ARCH coefficients is less than one, and their individual values are positive, so that unconditional volatility is also always positive, i.e., 𝛼𝛼1+ 𝛽𝛽1< 1 and 𝛼𝛼1, 𝛽𝛽1≥ 0 and 𝑐𝑐 > 0. 6. Results and Discussion 6.1 Results In this section, Table 1 (1 a.m. to 12 a.m.) and Table 2 (1 p.m. to 12 p.m.) show the results of the SARMAX/GARCH models for each hour of the day. It was assumed that the error followed a Student-t distribution, and the maximum likelihood estimator was used in all the models. The econometric modelling of this study followed the principle of parsimony but, to check that the results were robust, a comparison was made with the outcomes of non-parsimonious models. No substantial differences were identified, either in the sign or statistical significance of the variables. This confirmed that the estimates generated from this analysis were accurate. The goodness of fit of results was also checked by using both the Ljung-Box Q- Statistics and the ARCH-LM diagnostic tests. The absence of serial autocorrelation in standardised squared residuals until 8 lags was confirmed by the results of the Ljung-Box Q-Statistics test, for most estimations. Some exceptions occurred between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. when the maximum number of lags with which autocorrelation was rejected was 5. On first appearance, this result raised some concerns regarding accuracy, but it actually reflects the fact that this is a period of growing instability in electricity systems when electricity consumption is ramping up. Please note that the choice of the number of lags was based on a criterion of uniformity among all the estimations, and there were hours when the rejection of autocorrelation exceeded 8 lags. However, 8 lags are acceptable since it was anticipated that after 8 days the system would return to equilibrium, so that autocorrelation issues would not be a concern. The rejection of autocorrelation in squared residuals was extremely important because it indicated that the volatility was well captured and/or explained. With regard to standardised residuals, the results confirmed the presence of autocorrelation in estimations between 4 a.m. and 12 p.m. These results may be consistent with potential inefficiencies in the forecasting of the day-ahead electricity price and/or JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 16 electricity production. However, autocorrelation only constitutes a problem if a market splitting mechanism occurs and electricity prices between Spain and Portugal diverge. In such cases, investors may benefit from opportunities of arbitrage. As noted in Section 3 (and Fig 1), electricity prices in Spain and Portugal tend to match each other, with no discernible persistent episodes of price differences. Therefore, this issue of autocorrelation should not affect the robustness of the results. With regard to the ARCH effects (or heteroskedasticity) in the residuals, the results also suggested the absence of heteroskedasticity up to 8 lags for each of the 24 hours. Finally, the analysis of the Quantile-Quantile plots showed that most of the data overlapped the theoretical line, which indicated that the residuals followed a Student-t distribution in all estimations3. 3 Please note that, to save space, the Quantile-Quantile plots are not presented, but they are available on request from the authors.

JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 20 Most of the 24 estimations proved stationary, in other words, 𝛼𝛼1+ 𝛽𝛽1< 1 was confirmed in the majority of the models. Please note that, some models were not stationary, specifically: (i) between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.; and (ii) at 8 a.m., 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. The non-stationarity of these models of these hours is actually unsurprising, as they are periods when the Spanish market is likely to exhibit high dynamics (in the latter case (ii)), or low dynamics (in the former case (i)). Other than this, the inverted roots of the AR and MA processes were stationary in all estimations, suggesting the models were stable. The statistical significance and negative sign of the results of electricity produced from wind power on the day-ahead electricity price confirmed the MOE of wind power in all hours of the day. However, the magnitude of this effect varied significantly, i.e., wind power appeared to have a stronger impact during the off-peak period of electricity consumption than in the peak period. It had the highest impact between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. when a 1% increase in wind power production decreased the price of electricity by 0.1835% (Table 1). With regard to volatility, electricity produced from wind power was shown to increase volatility in the day-ahead electricity price in each of the 24 hours. Once again, this impact had different magnitudes depending on whether it occurred during an off-peak or peak hour. The impact of wind power on the volatility of the electricity price was shown to be about twice as high in off-peak hours. Focusing on solar PV power, its production decreased day-ahead electricity prices in some hours. As expected, the MOE of solar PV power reached its maximum during peak hours (in contrast to wind power). As Table 2 illustrates, the greatest impact of solar PV power on the day-ahead electricity price was at 2 p.m., when the price of electricity was decreased by 0.0535%. The results also indicate that electricity generation from solar PV power affects the volatility of the day-ahead electricity price both positively and negatively. This impact followed a discernible pattern in which solar PV power seemed to decrease volatility in electricity prices at certain hours in the off-peak period while increasing it in the midday peak hours.

JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 23 In all 24 hours, electricity consumption showed a noticeable upward impact on the day-ahead electricity price. In particular, electricity consumption had a substantial impact on the electricity price at 7 a.m., increasing it by 0.9016%. The results also showed that electricity consumption had the least impact in peak hours (between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m.). However, this result was not entirely unexpected, as peak demand is generally accompanied by an increase in the electricity supply. This increases the competitiveness of the electricity market, so that electricity prices must become more competitive, and may actually be lowered. Therefore, it should be stressed that increases in electricity consumption levels (especially in peak periods of consumption) do not necessarily mean an increase in the magnitude of its impact on electricity prices, as the availability of energy sources during peak periods is generally greater than during off-peak hours. Spanish electricity prices appear to be increased by electricity inflow, whereas., electricity outflow seems to impact them both positively and negatively. It is worth mentioning that the results show that electricity outflow is only statistically significant for a few hours of the day. Furthermore, when electricity inflow is statistically significant, electricity outflow appears to be statistically non-significant, and vice-versa. This phenomenon may indicate that MIBEL has a shallow depth of market in which electricity exchange should be primarily seen as a strategy for balancing the interconnected systems. Fig. 3 presents the values for both the ARCH and GARCH lag parameters of each estimation. Fig. 3. Results of the ARCH parameter and GARCH lag parameter for each of the 24 estimations. Lastly, volatility in the day-ahead electricity price was shown to be highly persistent, i.e., 𝛼𝛼1+ 𝛽𝛽1 ≅ 1.

(2019)). Fig.3 clearly shows that the values 𝛼𝛼1 and 𝛽𝛽1 have contrasting behaviour: when 𝛼𝛼1 increases, 𝛽𝛽1 decreases, and vice-versa. It is also worth mentioning the behaviour between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m., a period when both electricity production from solar PV power and consumption increase exponentially. This would be expected to lead to greater uncertainty in electricity prices, so it is unsurprising that high 𝛼𝛼1 values and low 𝛽𝛽1 values were found in this period. Overall, the values of 𝛼𝛼1 were higher than those of 𝛽𝛽1 , meaning that the Spanish electricity system is highly vulnerable to new shocks. Therefore, market participants are likely to exhibit an exaggerated reaction to unexpected shocks in electricity prices, causing volatility and higher instability. 6.2 Discussion Peaks of electricity generated from RES (especially from wind power) still do not match peaks of electricity consumption, as the two peaks do not generally coincide, mainly because of the inherent intermittency of RES. To alleviate these imbalances in supply and demand, interconnections are extremely useful, because they enable electricity surpluses to be exchanged and allow demand for electricity consumption to be satisfied by inflows during periods of high demand. Electricity usually flows from areas with low electricity prices to areas where prices are high, i.e., between areas with surplus production and those with excess demand of electricity at any one time. Therefore, the overall cost of electricity produced is likely to be reduced with cross-border electricity exchange systems. Nonetheless, electricity prices are highly volatile, and an in-depth understanding of the stochastic dynamics of electricity markets is essential for market participants to properly manage their risks. This study confirms the MOE of both wind and solar PV power, and the downward impact of electricity inflow on electricity prices. The downward impact of wind on the day-ahead electricity price underlines that the MOE occurred during every hour of the day, although its magnitude varied significantly throughout the day. For wind power, the magnitude of this MOE depended on the level of wind power production, the hour of the day, and the level of electricity consumption. The study also highlights that wind power reduced electricity prices more during off-peak hours. This result was reasonable since during off-peak hours, there was low consumption in the market and high production from wind. Furthermore, wind power increased volatility in the Spanish day-ahead electricity price most strongly in off-peak periods of consumption. In summary, the JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 25 study’s use of an hour-by-hour analysis enabled a fuller understanding of the influence of various components of the generation mix on the magnitude of the MOE. The MOE of solar PV power was also confirmed in the Spanish electricity system. In contrast to wind power, the impact of solar PV production was more pronounced during the midday peak hours of consumption. The peak of electricity produced from solar PV power generally matched the midday peak of electricity consumption. Consequently, electricity demand was more likely to be satisfied by solar PV power, and electricity sources with higher marginal costs (e.g., combined-cycle production) were displaced from the merit curve, and thus, electricity prices were lowered. These adjustments in the structure of the generation mix may have contributed to the increased volatility of electricity prices during the midday peak. Conversely, solar PV power appeared to reduce the volatility of electricity prices in the late afternoon. In this period, production levels of solar PV power decreased, reducing its potential to satisfy demand. Fig. 4 shows the average of Spanish real-time electricity produced from each electricity source for each hour of the day. As Fig. 4 shows, during the late afternoon, there was an increase in production levels from hydropower, which, like solar PV power, has low marginal costs. Therefore, electricity prices are unlikely to suffer substantial variations in the late afternoon, and thus the impact of solar PV power in reducing volatility should implicitly reinforce this effect. Next, if we consider the impact of electricity consumption, it was shown to have an upward effect on the day-ahead electricity price in all hours. This impact was greatest in the morning peak, and was least in the late afternoon (i.e., when electricity consumption was moving into the night peak). This latter finding is consistent with the corresponding increase in levels of electricity supply following the basic principles of demand-supply theory. Fig. 4 clearly shows that average electricity generation was at its highest between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. During this period, there was a discernible increase in production from wind power, followed by a sharp increase in hydroelectric production and a slight rise in production from combined cycle energy sources. Thus, the availability of energy resources between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. was high (especially wind and hydropower), and both electricity supply and competitiveness were likewise increased. JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 26 Fig. 4. Average of the real time electricity generation for each hour of the day, from 1 May 2015 to 31 December 2020. In electricity markets, electricity flows between interconnected systems can lead to two possible scenarios. In the first scenario, if the interconnection lines become congested, electricity prices may diverge between the cross-border electricity systems, and a market splitting phenomenon is more likely to occur (Ringler et al., 2017). Electricity usually flows from a lower-price area (exporter country) to a higher-price area (importer country). Therefore, if the interconnection lines become constrained, electricity inflow is liable to increase the electricity price in the importing country and decrease it in the exporting one. Meanwhile, in the second scenario, if the interconnections are uncongested, electricity flows between the cross-border systems until their electricity prices become roughly equalised (Keles et al., 2020). Consequently, this adjustment in electricity prices is likely to increase the electricity price in the exporting country while decreasing it in the importing country. In Spain, the statistical significance and negative impact of electricity inflows on the mean of the day-ahead electricity price (in most hours) suggests that its electricity system approximates more closely to the second scenario. Despite the shallow depth of market in MIBEL, it seems to manage its exchange of electricity efficiently, and thus, generally avoids market-splitting phenomena. Looking now at the study’s findings regarding the effect of the outflow of electricity on the mean day-ahead electricity price, the results show that it was only statistically significance for a few hours of the day. During the early morning, between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., electricity outflow increased the price of electricity. Why then, did the Spanish electricity system export electricity during a peak period? The results show that electricity 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 Combined Cycle Coal Cogeneration Hydro Nuclear Solar PV Thermal Renewables Wind Solar ThermalJournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 27 production from hydro and solar PV power also increased between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. (cf. Fig.4), so that the Spanish system may have had surplus electricity at this time. Furthermore, electricity prices in neighbouring systems may have made exporting electricity more attractive, so that the price of electricity in Spain was adjusted upwards. The Spanish system may also be maximising the capacity of solar thermal power stations through shared backup. In addition to supplying electricity to neighbouring countries, the Spanish system was also being economically compensated. In general, the results also suggest that the volatility of day-ahead electricity prices was reduced by electricity inflows and increased by outflows. The reduction in the volatility of electricity prices due to electricity inflows, may indicate that this exchange of electricity helped balance the system. However, it should be stressed that the behaviour of electricity prices in neighbouring countries, especially their stochastic behaviour, could also easily be reflected in domestic electricity prices. Therefore, the increased volatility in the price of electricity in Spain due to electricity outflow probably reflected imbalances in neighbouring electricity prices when exporting electricity. Finally, this study also found that the volatility of the day-ahead electricity price was characterised by a notable persistence during the midday peak hours and at 2 a.m. This finding is in line with the results obtained by Ioannidis et al. (2021) for the German electricity market. Furthermore, for certain hours (e.g., between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m., and at 8 a.m., 1 p.m. and 8 p.m.) the estimated persistence of volatility exceeded one, which means that the unconditional variance is infinite. One possible explanation for this is the tendency of volatility to increase in periods when there is concurrent decreased electricity supply from RES and high demand, and vice-versa. For instance, peak periods usually produce highly dynamic electricity markets, which eventually lead to extreme events and instability in electricity prices. Overall, the main findings of this study indicate that the MOE of wind power has different magnitudes throughout the day, and that the inflow of electricity causes decreased volatility in the Spanish day-ahead electricity price. The envisaged expansion of both solar PV and wind power capacity in coming years requires future research into the impact of higher production levels from these sources on the congestion of transmission lines. Another fertile area for future research is an assessment of the impact on the MOE of an increase in flows of electricity between MIBEL and both Morocco and France. JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 28 7. Conclusions Increased levels of generation from wind and solar PV power in the electricity generation mix has provoked a profound restructuring of electricity markets and a complete rethinking of strategies for market participants. One of the restructuring measures has been to increase the capacity of interconnections and, as a consequence, it has become extremely important to evaluate the impact of electricity flows on electricity prices. With this in mind, this paper analysed the impact of electricity inflow and outflow, as well as of wind and solar PV power, on the mean of Spanish day-ahead electricity prices and their volatility. The data was analysed on an hour-by-hour basis, with each hour of the day being assessed individually, from 1 May 2015 to 31 December 2020. The MOE was confirmed for both wind and solar PV power in almost all hours of the day. This analysis also showed that wind and solar PV power had differing impacts on the day-ahead electricity price during the 24 hours. Thus, the Spanish generation mix was likely to change throughout the day depending on the availability of electricity produced from RES. Apart from sharp reductions in electricity prices and corresponding reduced revenue, market participants also had to deal with the intraday adjustment of generation schedules, from which they were likely to incur additional costs. Wind power played a clear role in increasing the volatility of the day-ahead electricity price in all hours, most markedly during off-peak hours. MIBEL mostly operates under the day-ahead market, so that electricity price bids are based on forecast electricity production and consumption. The increased volatility in electricity prices may also have been partly due to errors in this forecasting, so that the benefits of operating intraday and/or real-time markets should also be evaluated. Electricity inflow seemed to create potential benefits for the Spanish electricity system, as it decreased both the volatility and value of day-ahead electricity prices, a possible manifestation of price convergence with connected countries. Improving the efficiency of interconnections could maximise the exchange of RES, enabling production costs to be optimised, and increasing security of supply for the whole market. Although MIBEL appears to be efficiently managing instantaneous electricity supply and demand in Spain and Portugal, the volatility of day-ahead electricity prices in Spain seems to be highly susceptible to unexpected market events (or new shocks). To effectively deal with such events, electricity systems must ensure they have optimal flexible backup capacity. JournalPre-proof Journal Pre-proof 29 Thus, policies incentivising flexibility in the capacity of electricity systems are crucial to guarantee the predictability and reliability of electricity markets. Demand-Side Management (DSM) measures and policies could also be helpful in achieving flexibility for electricity markets as DSM programmes can be structured to match the dynamics of electricity markets, particularly the setting of electricity prices. This way, electricity consumers would be incentivised to react to price signals, and to shift their consumption to periods when electricity is predominantly generated by RES. Incentivising consumers to produce their own electricity would also reduce overloading interconnections. Distributed generation is a strategy by which electricity consumption is satisfied by local RES electricity production. This strategy would encourage RES electricity production outside the market, potentially mitigating the MOE. Encouraging electricity consumers to adjust their habits and patterns could also reduce the volatility of electricity prices, thereby increasing the overall stability of electricity systems. In conclusion, despite the still limited capacity of MIBEL’s interconnections, they still play a prominent role in this market, as shown by the ability of electricity inflows to reduce both the volatility and level of electricity prices. However, given the envisaged expansion in the capacity of RES within MIBEL, there is expected to be an increase in the volume of electricity traded. Notwithstanding the current effectiveness of MIBEL’s interconnections, there is a critical need to increase their capacity as the electricity market expands, so that potential congestion can be reduced, and the adverse effects of MOE are mitigated throughout the day.
