(Ken Lambert / The Seattle Times) More  The Seattle Times editorial board recommends: Vote ‘no’ on Seattle Proposition 1, the transportation levy Oct. 14, 2024 at 3:10 pm By The Seattle Times editorial board The $1.55 billion Seattle transportation levy is not an infrastructure plan as much as a political document. It was created by Mayor Bruce Harrell and placed on the ballot by the Seattle City Council to win votes. To wit: changing the duration of the levy from 9 to 8 years so its next renewal lines up with presidential elections, which theoretically turn out a more tax-sympathetic electorate. 10/18/24, 10:04 P M The S eattle Times editorial board recommends: Vote ‘no’ on S eattle P roposition 1, the transportation levy | The S eattle Times chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 1/4 For those considering the tax — which amounts to $528 annually for properties assessed at the median value of $804,000, almost doubling the current cost of $276 — the real questions are: Is it a well-drafted political document? Does it deliver what the public wants while balancing the needs of special interests? (See the organizations that participated in the news release announcing the final levy package: Cascade Bicycle Club, Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, Transportation Choices Coalition, others). The editorial board determined that Proposition 1 fails the test. Voters ought to reject this very expensive measure and tell drafters to come back with something either less expensive or that actually delivers on the needs that residents clearly identified in the city’s own polls. Let’s take a look at bridges, roads and bikes. When pollsters hired by the city asked residents to rate their priorities, the top item turned out to be “ Proactively maintain Seattle’s bridges to avoid more expensive repairs in the future.” Seattle has a spotty record on bridge maintenance, even though it has long been a stated goal of its transportation levies. The first levy in 2006 was named “ Bridging the Gap,” but a 2020 report by the Seattle city auditor noted “ the City is not spending enough to keep its bridges in good condition and avoid costly repairs.” The auditor suggested the Seattle Department of Transportation spend a minimum of $34 million annually on maintenance. That would amount to $272 million over eight years of the levy. But the package before voters spends only $127 million over that time for “ preventative maintenance.” In an editorial board interview, Harrell said other funds would be pulled into bridge work besides the levy. He said it could amount to $35 million annually — but there were no guarantees. The lack of specific funding is one reason why voters should reject the current measure, said former city Councilmember Alex Pedersen. As its former transportation committee chair, he knows a lot about the city’s infrastructure funding. 10/18/24, 10:04 P M The S eattle Times editorial board recommends: Vote ‘no’ on S eattle P roposition 1, the transportation levy | The S eattle Times chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/4 “ When I was asking for more investments for bridges when I was on the council in the wake of the West Seattle Bridge closing, I was told by SDOT ‘Don’t worry, we’ll have it in the next levy renewal,’” said Pedersen. “ Instead, they are kicking the can down the road.” The second highest priority for Seattle voters according to the city’s poll was repaving major streets that are rated in poor condition. A 2020 SDOT report determined that 58% of Seattle’s arterial streets were in fair, poor or very poor condition. Just maintaining the current condition of city streets would cost about $520 million over eight years, according to SDOT. The levy includes only $330 million for “ arterial roadway maintenance” and $67 million for pothole repairs. What’s more troubling, the funds are directed to approximately 15 roadway reconstruction projects, some of which are about a mile or so. Harrell said the package reflected the need to fix roads that carry big trucks. “ We have to stop the bleeding in some of our heavy industrial areas that we have identified and, quite frankly, that’s not where you live. That’s not where people go everyday but that’s where we have to get around and have to protect,” he told the board. The question remains — for $1.55 billion spent over eight years, will the average homeowner, renter, and business owner paying the tax see an appreciable improvement in Seattle roadways? The answer seems to be “ No.” The levy would spend $133.5 million on “ Bicycle Safety.” That’s more than what’s allotted to “ Signals and Ops” ($100 million), “ People Streets & Public Spaces” ($66.5 million), “ Freight & Goods Movement” ($45 million) and “ Good Governance” ($7.5 million). The city’s poll states that “ The availability of bike lanes” is something Seattle already does well — 61% of respondents give SDOT ratings of “ excellent” or “ good.” It’s the department’s highest score. Meanwhile, 60% said SDOT does a poor job of managing congestion, and 36% give the condition of streets and roads the lowest rating. The voters are clearly telling city planners their priorities. The final product on the ballot begs the question whether anyone was listening. 10/18/24, 10:04 P M The S eattle Times editorial board recommends: Vote ‘no’ on S eattle P roposition 1, the transportation levy | The S eattle Times chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 3/4 Perhaps the most depressing thing about the Levy to Move Seattle is the council’s creation of a separate Transportation Funding Task Force to go along with the measure. According to a council resolution: “ The Council expects the Task Force to direct particular attention to the transportation network’s greatest needs, including sidewalks, bridges, and paving projects,” and come up with funding ideas, including possibly another levy. Most Read Opinion Stories Nine years since voters passed the last transportation levy, and this is what voters get to decide: a whopping $1.55 billion package that whiffs on the basics so badly it contains language for a potentially massive add-on. It is true: The city’s poll also shows the transportation levy passing with a comfortable majority. Approving levies is baked into local politics. Seattleites, expect better from your city government. Reject Proposition 1 and demand a redo. The Seattle Times editorial board; members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
