Follow Megan McArdle This exchange comes from “The Adventure of the Silver Blaze,” a short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Even though the story is more than 100 years old, I won’t spoil it if you haven’t read it. But I will tell you what was so curious: The dog didn’t bark at an intruder. I tell you this because Tuesday’s election had its own dog that didn’t bark. That is, abortion rights. Abortion has been a mainstay of Democratic political campaigns for decades, and it was a good issue for them in 2022. Even deep-red Kentucky voted to keep abortion legal, a process that helped turn out voters. By long political tradition, voters who favor abortion rights also favor Democrats. Political analysts, noting President Joe Biden’s poor approval ratings, expected 2022 to be a red wave. Instead, Democrats gained a Senate seat, while holding Republicans to a narrow majority in the House of Representatives. Having earlier predicted that the much- anticipated post-Roe backlash might never materialize, I had to eat some crow. “As abortion law in every state settled down to something close to the median of public opinion, I thought the issue would probably 12/16/24, 8:34 PM Opinion | Red wave proves abortion is no longer a winning issue for Democrats - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/5 cease to exert much political force,” I wrote last year. “I have not been this wrong since I decided in 2016 to go on holiday after the election, because I thought there would be little worth covering in Hillary Clinton’s presidential transition.” Chastened, I began saying that it would be political malpractice if Democrats didn’t have an abortion initiative on the ballot of every possible state come 2024. Democrats seemed to agree with me that this was one of their winningest issues — “a vital part of Democrat Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign,” says the Reuters retrospective. Progressives started hitting the topic hard in 2023, and gave it prominent placement in Harris’s speeches. In Senate races, more money was spent on abortion ads than any other issue. Ten abortion measures were on ballots this year, which promised a boost. Looking at the sea of red on the map, it’s shocking how little good all this effort seems to have done, compared with 2022’s success. Nevada and Arizona had abortion on the ballot, and yet Donald Trump looks set to carry them by a more comfortable margin than Michigan and Wisconsin, which didn’t. Perhaps those measures will help Democrats win Senate seats in those two states (which are still counting). Yet, in Arizona, it’s hard to argue that abortion mattered more than Kari Lake’s abysmal campaigning skills. Exit polls suggest that in Nevada and Arizona, roughly a quarter of voters 12/16/24, 8:34 PM Opinion | Red wave proves abortion is no longer a winning issue for Democrats - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 3/5 who favored abortion-rights ballot measures also voted for Trump. And, so, I have to revise my opinion again, to something closer to my original belief. Post- Dobbs, abortion was a good issue for Democrats — briefly. But now that states are settling the matter, it’s not such a great issue, at least nationally. One reason is that Trump seems inclined to leave it to the states, rather than pursuing a national abortion ban, which would be divisive. Another reason is, ironically, that Democrats were having so much success at the state level, winning multiple initiatives in red and blue states, while losing only in Florida, South Dakota and Nebraska. With abortion rights being settled at the state level, voters apparently felt free to cast their presidential ballot on other issues they cared about, such as the economy. That’s good news. The issue of abortion has been distorting American politics for years, as pro-lifers who were denied normal legislative channels for pursuing their agenda instead focused their energy on gaining control of the courts — and pro-choicers naturally followed suit. Voters and politicians have increasingly come to view the Supreme Court as a kind of super-legislature, a way to bypass the compromises and democratic accountability of normal politics. 12/16/24, 8:34 PM Opinion | Red wave proves abortion is no longer a winning issue for Democrats - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 4/5 That’s a subversion of the court’s purpose and a terrible way to decide genuinely hard issues — such as how to make trade-offs between the potential life that is blotted out when an abortion is performed and the existing life of a woman who has a right to control what happens to her body. I think it’s better to leave that question to voters at the state level, who can hammer out compromises that their communities can live with. But even if you disagree, it looks as though that is where the issue now rests. Republicans would be fools to campaign on an unpopular national abortion ban. And Democrats vying for national office would be almost as foolish to stake their campaigns on an issue that voters are increasingly settling for themselves. 12/16/24, 8:34 PM Opinion | Red wave proves abortion is no longer a winning issue for Democrats - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 5/5","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
