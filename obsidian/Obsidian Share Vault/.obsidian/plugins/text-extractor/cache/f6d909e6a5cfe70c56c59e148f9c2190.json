The multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) models in the literature include the BEKK model by Engle and Kroner (1995), the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model by Engel (2002), and the varying correlation (VC) model by Tse and Tsui (2002). However, these models have been estimated under the multivariate normality assumption, while this assumption has beenrejectedinmuchofthe empirical ﬁndings — Fama and French (1993), Richardson and Smith (1993), Longin and Solnik (2001), Mashal and Zeevi (2002), among many others. We propose a simple new model named a Copula-based Multivariate GARCH model, or in short C-MGARCH model, which permits modeling conditional correlation and de- pendence separately and simultaneously for interested ﬁnancial returns with non-elliptically distributed dependent errors. Our approach is based on a transformation, which removes the linear correlation from the dependent variables to form uncorrelated dependent errors. The dependence structure is controlled by a copula while the correlation is modeled by an MGARCH model. The C-MGARCH model can capture the dependence in the uncorre- lated errors ignored by all existing MGARCH models. For every MGARCH model, the corresponding C-MGARCH model can be constructed. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review on MGARCH models. Section 3 introduces the new C-MGARCH model with uncorrelated dependent errors. Monte Carlo simulation in Section 4 illustrates how MGARCH and C-MGARCH perform under the non-elliptical distributions, and shows the likelihood gains of the C-MGARCH models. Section 5 conducts empirical analysis for comparison of existing MGARCH models with their corresponding C-MGARCH models in terms of in-sample model selection criteria and out- of-sample density predictive ability. The C-MGARCH models outperform corresponding DCC, VC and BEKK models when they are applied to a pair of the U.S. equity indices (NASDAQ and Dow Jones) and two pairs of the foreign exchange rates (French Franc and Deutschemark, and Japanese Yen and Deutschemark). Section 6 concludes. Section 7 is Appendix on copulas. 1 2MGARCH Models We begin with a brief review of three MGARCH models. Suppose a vector of the k return series {rt} T t=1 with E(rt|Ft−1) ≡ µt and E(rtr 0 t|Ft−1) ≡ Ht where Ft−1 is the information set (σ-ﬁeld) at time t − 1. For simplicity, we assume the conditional mean µt is zero. For Ht, many speciﬁcations have been proposed. Engle and Kroner (1995) propose the BEKK model Ht = CC 0 + A(rt−1r 0 t−1)A 0 + BHt−1B 0, (1) With the scalar or diagonal speciﬁcations on A and B, we obtain the scalar BEKK or the diagonal BEKK. Instead of modeling Ht directly, conditional correlation models decompose Ht into DtRtDt, where D 2 t ≡ diag(Ht). As the conditional covariance matrix for εt ≡ D −1 t rt is the conditional correlation matrix for rt, Engle (2002) considers modeling Qt, the covariance matrix of εt, via a variance-targeting scalar BEKK model: Qt =(1 − a − b) ¯Q + a(εt−1ε 0 t−1)+ bQt−1, (2) where ¯Q is the sample covariance matrix of ˆεt. A transformation Rt =diagQ −1 t Qt diagQ −1 t makes the conditional correlation matrix for rt. The VC model of Tse and Tsui (2002) uses the following speciﬁcation Rt =(1 − a − b) ¯R + a ˜Rt−1 + bRt−1, (3) where ¯R is the positive deﬁnite unconditional correlation matrixwithonesindiagonal, and ˜Rt = PM i=1 ε1,t−iε2,t−i/ ³PM i=1 ε2 1,t−i PM i=1 ε 2 2,t−i´1/2. 1 3 New Model: C-MGARCH In the vast existing MGARCH literature, the distribution for rt is assumed to be a certain bivariate elliptical distribution (e.g., bivariate normal or Student t)withmean µt (= 0) 1In Tse and Tsui (2002), a necessary condition to guarantee ˜Rt positive deﬁnite is M > k.Another necessary condition for non-singularity of ˜Rt, which should be added, is that M should be bigger than the maximum number of observations of consecutive zeros of εi,t, i =1, ..., k. In the empirical section, we set M = 5, which is transaction days in one week. 2 and conditional covariance Ht. The standardized errors et = H −1/2 t rt wouldthenhavethe same bivariate elliptical distribution with zero mean and identity covariance: E(et|Ft−1)= 0and E(ete 0 t|Ft−1)= I. However, Embrechts et al. (1999) point out some wide-spread misinterpretations of the correlation, e.g., that no-correlation does not imply independence and a positive correlation does not mean positive dependence. Here, the identity conditional covariance matrix of et itself does not imply independence except when et follows an elliptical distribution. The key point of this paper is that we permit dependence among the elements of et even if they are uncorrelated as shown by E(ete 0 t|Ft−1)= I. The C-MGARCH model speciﬁes the dependence structure and the conditional correlation separately and simultaneously. The former is controlled by a copula function and the latter is modeled by an MGARCH model for Ht. Before we introduce our new C-MGARCH model, we ﬁrst brieﬂy review the copula theory (with some more details in Appendix). 3.1 Copula Although there are many univariate distributions used in econometrics, for multivariate dis- tribution there are few competitive candidates besides multivariate normal distribution and multivariate Student’s t distribution. However, the multivariate normal distribution is not consistent with the well-known asymmetry and excess kurtosis in ﬁnancial data although it is easy to use. In this paper, we use the recently popular copulas to construct uncorrelated dependent errors. The principle characteristic of a copula function is its ability to decom- pose the joint distribution into two parts: marginal distributions and dependence structure. Diﬀerent dependence structures can combine the same marginal distributions into diﬀerent joint distributions. Similarly, diﬀerent marginal distributions under the same dependence structure can also lead to diﬀerent joint distributions. We focus on the bivariate case, which however can be easily extended to multivariate cases. Deﬁnition (Copula): Afunction C :[0, 1] 2 → [0, 1] is a copula if it satisﬁes (i) C(u, v)=0 for u =0 or v =0; (ii) P2 i=1 P2 j=1(−1) i+jC(ui,vj) ≥0 for all (ui,vj) in [0, 1] 2 with u1 <u2 and v1 <v2;and (iii) C(u, 1) = u, C(1,v)= v for all u, v in [0, 1]. ¥ The relationship between a copula and joint distribution function is illuminated by Sklar’s (1959) theorem. 3 Theorem (Sklar): Let K be a joint distribution function with margins F and G.Then there exists a copula C such that for all η1, η2 in R, K(η1, η2)= C(F (η1),G(η2)) = C(u, v). (4) Conversely, if C is a copula and F and G are distribution functions, then the function K deﬁned above is a joint distribution function with margins F and G. ¥ The density c(·, ·) associated with C(·, ·)is c(u, v)= ∂2C(u,v) ∂u∂v and its relationship with the marginal density functions, f (·)and g(·), and the joint density function k(·)is k(η1, η2)= c(F (η1),G(η2)) × f (η1) × g(η2), (5) where f (η1)= ∂F (η1)/∂η1, g(η2)= ∂G(η2)/∂η2 and k(η1, η2)= ∂2K(η1,η2) ∂η1∂η2 . For independent copula C(u, v)= uv, c(u, v) = 1. An important property of copula function is its invariance under the increasing and continuous transformation, such as log transformation. The joint survival function ¯C(u, v)is ¯C(u, v)=Pr(U> u, V > v)=1 − u − v + C(u, v). The survival copula of C(u, v)is CS(u, v)= u + v − 1+ C(1 − u, 1 − v). The joint survival function and the survival copula are related through ¯C(u, v)= CS(1 − u, 1 − v). The density of survival copula can be expressed through the density of original copula as cS(u, v)= c(1 − u, 1 − v). Upper tail dependence λU and lower tail dependence λL deﬁned as λU = lim u↑1 Pr[η2 >G −1(u)|η1 >F −1(u)] = lim u↑1 [1 − 2u + C(u, u)] 1 − u , λL = lim u↓0 Pr[η2 6 G −1(u)|η1 6 F −1(u)] = lim u↓0 C(u, u) u , measure the dependence in extreme cases. The tail dependence of each copula is discussed in Appendix. In this paper, we use the independent (I) copula, Gumbel (G) copula, Clayton (C) copula, Frank (F) copula, Gumbel survival (GS) copula, Clayton survival (CS) copula, and Joe-Clayton (JC) copula. Their functional forms andproperties arediscussedinAppendix. From (5), the log-likelihood function is: L(θ, α)= TX t=1 ln[f (η1,t; θ1)g(η2,t; θ2)] + TX t=1 ln c[F (η1,t; θ1),G(η2,t; θ2); α](6) ≡ LM (θ)+ LC(θ, α), 4 where T is the number of the observations, θ =(θ0 1 θ0 2) 0 are the parameters in the marginal densities f (·)and g(·), and α is the copula shape parameter(s). The likelihood L(θ, α)is decomposed into two parts, the ﬁrst term LM (θ) is related to the marginal distributions and the second term LC(θ, α) is related to the copula. 3.2 Models using copula We note that the MGARCH models discussed in Section 2 can also be put in the copula framework with elliptical copulas (normal or t). For example, to estimate for Ht = DtRtDt, the DCC model of Engle (2002) assumes the normal margins for elements of εt = D −1 t rt = (ε1,t ε2,t) 0 and the normal copula for ut = Φ(ε1,t; θ1)and vt = Φ(ε2,t; θ2)(where Φ(·)isthe univariate normal CDF) with the copula shape parameter being the time-varying conditional correlation Rt. This is to assume the bivariate normal distribution. Let θ be parameters in Dt, and α in Rt. The log-likelihood function for the DCC model has the form: L(θ, α)= −1 2 TX t=1 2ln(2π)+ r 0 tH −1 t rt +ln |Ht| (7) = −1 2 TX t=1 ¡ 2ln(2π)+ r 0 tD −2 t rt +ln |Dt| 2¢ − 1 2 TX t=1 ¡ ln |Rt| + ε 0 tR −1 t εt − ε 0 tεt¢ , where the ﬁrst part corresponds to the normal marginal log-likelihood LM (θ)and thesec- ond part corresponds to the normal copula log-likelihood LC(θ, α)= PT t=1 ln ct(Ft(ε1,t; θ1), Gt(ε2,t; θ2); α) in (6). See (14) in Appendix. The margins contain Dt and the copula contains Rt. To accommodate the deviations from bivariate normality in the ﬁnancial data, there have been other related attempts in the literature that use copulas. However, all of these works focus on modeling the conditional dependence instead of the conditional correlation. For example, taking the empirical distribution functions (EDF) for the margins and a parametric function for the copula, Breymann et al. (2003) and Chen and Fan (2005) estimate D 2 t ≡ diag(Ht) using univariate realized volatility estimated from high frequency data or using univariate GARCH models. In that framework, estimated are the univariate conditional variances D 2 t and the conditional dependence, but not the conditional correlation Rt nor the conditional covariance Ht (if non-elliptical copulas are used). The aim of this paper is to model Ht for non-elliptically distributed ﬁnancial returns 5 using non-elliptical copulas. We now introduce such a model. The idea is to have the new C-MGARCH model inherited from the existing MGARCH models to model Ht,atthe same time it is also to capture the remaining dependence in the uncorrelated dependent standardized errors et = H −1/2 t rt. 3.3 Structure of C-MGARCH model The C-MGARCH model can be formulated as follows: ηt|Ft−1 ∼C(Ft(·),Gt(·); αt), (8) et = Σ −1/2 t ηt, rt = H 1/2 t et, where E(et|Ft−1)= 0, E(ete 0 t|Ft−1)= I, E(ηt|Ft−1)= 0, E(ηtη0 t|Ft−1)= Σt =(σij,t), and C(·, ·) is the conditional copula function. The conventional approach is to assume bivariate independent normality for et (C(u, v)= uv, i.e., σ12 = 0), while our approach is to assume a dependent copula for ηt =(η1,t η2,t) 0 keeping et uncorrelated (C(u, v) 6= uv, i.e., σ12 6= 0). The main contribution of our C- MGARCH model is that it permits modeling the conditional correlation and dependence structure, separately and simultaneously. As the Hoeﬀding’s (1940) lemma shows, the covariance between η1 and η2 is a function of marginal distributions F (·)and G(·), and joint distribution K(·). See Lehmann (1966) and Shea (1983). Hoeﬀding’s Lemma: Let η1and η2 be random variables with the marginal distributions F and G and the joint distribution K. If the ﬁrst and second moments are ﬁnite, then σ12 ≡ Cov(η1, η2)= ZZ R2 [K(η1, η2) − F (η1)G(η2)] dη1dη2. (9) ¥ By Hoeﬀding’s Lemma and Sklar’s Theorem, the oﬀ-diagonal element σ12,t of the conditional covariance matrix Σt between η1,t and η2,t at time t, can be expressed as σ12,t(αt)= ZZ R2 £ C ¡ Ft(η1,t),Gt(η2,t); αt¢ − Ft(η1,t)Gt(η2,t) ¤ dη1dη2.(10) 6 For simplicity, we assume that the marginal distributions and the copula shape parameter are not time-varying: Ft(·) ≡ F (·), Gt(·) ≡ G(·), and αt ≡ α.This makes σ12,t(αt) ≡ σ12(α) and Σt(αt) ≡ Σ(α). 2 The log-likelihood function for ηt is: Lη(ηt)= TX t=1 ln f (η1,t)+ln g(η2,t)+ln c(F (η1,t),G(η2,t); α). (11) Because rt = H 1/2 t Σ −1/2ηt, the log-likelihood function for rt is: Lr(rt)= Lη(Σ 1/2H −1/2 t rt)+ TX t=1 ln ¯ ¯ ¯Σ 1/2H −1/2 t ¯ ¯ ¯ (12) = TX t=1 ln f (η1,t)+ln g(η2,t)+ln c(F (η1,t),G(η2,t); α)+ln ¯ ¯ ¯Σ 1/2H −1/2 t ¯ ¯ ¯ , where ¯ ¯ ¯Σ 1/2H −1/2 t ¯ ¯ ¯ is the Jacobian of the transformation from ηt to rt. Weuse themaximum likelihood method to estimate all unknown parameters in one step. Under some regularity conditions, the usual asymptotic properties of ML estimators may be obtained. Remark 1: Because et = Σ −1/2 t ηt,if Σ −1/2 t = Σ −1/2 ≡ (aij), then e1,t = a11η1,t + a12η2,t and e2,t = a12η1,t + a22η2,t would be linear combinations of two dependent random variables η1,t and η2,t.Even if each of η1,t and η2,t has the margins of standard normal distribution, the marginal distributions of e1,t and e2,t are not normal distribution because η1,t and η2,t are not independent. Remark 2: The C-MGARCH model nests all existing MGARCH models. When the cop- ula for ηt is independent copula, Σ is diagonal. In addition, if marginal distributions for ηt are standard normal, the C-MGARCH model degenerates to the corresponding MGARCH model with bivariate normal distribution for rt. The C-MGARCH model inherits the dy- namics of Ht from existing MGARCH models. For every MGARCH model, we can construct the corresponding C-MGARCH models with uncorrelated dependent errors. Remark 3: The C-MGARCH models permit modeling conditional correlation and de- pendence separately and simultaneously with non-elliptically distributed dependent errors, and remove correlation from dependence to form the uncorrelated dependent errors. The remaining dependence is then captured by a copula. To our knowledge, no previous models 2αt may be time-varying. For example, αt =1 + exp(a + bαt−1 + cut−1 + dvt−1) for Gumbel copula, will make 1 ≤αt < ∞. We leavethis for thefutureresearch. 7 incorporate correlation and dependence separately and simultaneously. Instead, they focus only on the dependence by modeling shape parameter in copula, Kendall’s τ , or Spearman’s %. However, as pointed out by Embrechts et al. (1999), the knowledge on Kendall’s τ or Spearman’s % alone can not help to choose the Markowitz risk-minimizing portfolio. The power of copulas is partly weakened by their unavailability of conditional covariance matrix. Diﬀerent from the existing ﬁnancial applications of copula theory, which focus on depen- dence and ignore the correlation, our C-MGARCH models are consistent with the main- stream methodology in ﬁnancial industry — the variance-covariance approach of optimizing portfolio. 4Monte Carlo We conduct the simulations on samples of moderate size T = 500 for bivariate systems sim- ulated from the C-MGARCH models (8) with normal margins, with each of DCC, VC, and BEKK models for Ht, and with Archimedean copulas. We then estimate C-MGARCH mod- els with and without restricting σ12 =0, while keeping models of Ht (DCC, VC, BEKK) and marginal density (normal) correctly speciﬁed. The parameter σ12 measures the dependence in the uncorrelated dependent error et. The likelihood-ratio between the two C-MGARCH models with and without restricting σ12 = 0 measures the dependence beyond the correla- tion (the dependence hidden in the uncorrelated errors). We also examine how the MLE performs in estimating the C-MGARCH models, particularly on the copula shape parameter α and σ12(α). The simulation takes the following steps. (i) Generate ηt from normal margins and a copula via the following method discussed in Nelsen (1999): draw two independent uniform [0, 1] variables u and p,and get v via v = c −1 u (p; α)where cu(p; α)= ∂C(u, v; α)/∂u.Then ηt ≡ (η1,t η2,t) 0 =(Φ −1(u) Φ −1(v)) 0 are the desired pair. 3 (ii) Compute Σt(α)from the Hoeﬀding formula. Standardize ηt to get et ≡ Σ −1/2 t ηt. (iii) For the copula-based DCC, get Ht = DtRtDt,where D 2 t =diag(hi,t h2,t), h1,t =0.01 + 0.05r2 1,t−1 +0.94h1,t−1, h2,t = 0.5+0.2r2 1,t−1 +0.5h2,t−1, Qt = CC 0 +0.2(εt−1ε 0 t−1)+0.7Qt−1, C ≡ (cij),c11 =0.4,c12 = 0,c21 =0.3,c22 =0.9, and Rt =diagQ −1 t Qt diagQ −1 t . We modify DCC into one-step estimation framework: to guarantee the positive deﬁnite of Qt, the Cholesky factorization 3We use a Matlab function, COPULARND, written by Perkins and Lane (2003) at MathWorks, Inc. 8 CC 0 is applied. The processes of h1,t and h2,t are same as Engle’s (2002) simulation design with high persistency for one and low persistency for the other. (iv) Finally, obtain rt ≡ H −1/2 t et. We replicate this data generation process 200 times. For the copula-based VC model, Step (iii) is replaced with Rt =(1 − 0.2 − 0.7) ¯R +0.2 ˜Rt−1 +0.7Rt−1 and the oﬀ- diagonal element of ¯R equal to 0.4. For the copula-based BEKK model, Step (iii) is replaced with Ht = CC 0 +0.05rt−1r 0 t−1 +0.91Ht−1 with the same C as for the DCC. Table 1 presents the results for MGARCH (denoted I-MGARCH with I for independent copula) and C-MGARCH models. The results are reported only with Frank copula, but those with Clayton copula and Gumbel copula are available upon request. The results are more or less the same. Presented are the Monte Carlo averages and the Monte Carlo standard deviations of the estimated shape parameter ˆα, the corresponding ˆσ12 ≡ σ12(ˆα), and the log- likelihood (logL). The correctly speciﬁed C-MGARCH model always has higher log-likelihood than the MGARCH model with wrong density assumption. The diﬀerence between the log- likelihood of the MGARCH model with the misspeciﬁed bivariate normal errors and that of the C-MGARCH model increases as the copula shape parameter α increases. For instance, for α =1 and σ12 =0.1570, the log-likelihoods of I-DCC and F-DCC are about the same, −1473.6and −1473.8, respectively. For α =9 and σ12 =0.7919, the log-likelihoods of I-DCC and F-DCC are −1451.1and −1423.4, respectively. The diﬀerence increases from −0.2to 27.7. It is evident that the C-MGARCH model captures the dependence not captured by Ht. For VC family, as the Frank copula shape parameter α increases from 1 to 9, the diﬀerence of the log-likelihoods of I-VC and F-VC increases from −0.4to28.7. For BEKK family, as α increases from 1 to 9, the diﬀerence increases from −0.04 to 29.95. These diﬀerences in logL are the dependence not captured by Ht but captured by Σ of the C-MGARCH models. 5 Empirical Analysis The objective of this section is to compare the C-MGARCH models with the conventional MGARCH models in terms of in-sample estimation and out-of-sample forecasting. To elu- cidate the eﬀect of the distinct feature (σ12) of the C-MGARCH model, we adopt the same normal marginal distribution and the same functional form of Ht for all the models under comparison, so that the diﬀerence arises only from the copula density. We examine a pair of NASDAQ composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow), 9 and two pairs of foreign exchange (FX) rate series (in U.S. dollars) — French Franc (FF) and Deutschemark (DM), and Japanese Yen (JY) and Deutschemark. The return series are 100 times the log diﬀerence of the stock indices or exchange rates. The daily U.S. equity indices are obtained from ﬁnance.yahoo.com, and the daily spot FX series are from the Federal Reserve Statistical Release. The sample periods of the data, out-of-sample forecast validation periods, and the size of rolling window to train forecasting models are as follows: In-sample estimation Out-of-sample forecasting NASDAQ-DOW Jan. 2, 1997 to Dec. 31, 2001 Jan. 4, 2001 to Dec. 31, 2001 T =1257 P = 248 with rolling window R =1009 FF-DM Jan. 4, 1993 to Dec. 31, 1998 Jan. 7, 1997 to Dec. 31, 1998 T =1509 P = 500 with rolling window R =1009 JY-DM Jan. 4, 1993 to Dec. 31, 1997 Jan. 5, 1997 to Dec. 31, 1997 T =1257 P = 250 with rolling window R =1007 5.1 In-sample estimation For the in-sample comparison between our C-MGARCH models and MGARCH models, Table 2 presents three model selection criteria (likelihood, AIC, SIC). For the NASDAQ- DOW pair and for the FF-DM pair, Gumbel Survival copula or Joe-Clayton copula are selected. Joe-Clayton copula nests Clayton copula as a special case. Gumbel Survival copula, Joe-Clayton copula, and Clayton copula all have the asymmetric tail dependence with positive lower tail dependence (λL > 0) and zero upper tail dependence (λU =0). This characteristic implies so called “crashing-together”. For the JY-DM pair, the model selection criteria select Frank copula, which has symmetric tail dependence. The log-likelihood ratio of two models is the entropy gain in the sense of Vuong (1989). The superiority of Gumbel Survival copula and Joe-Clayton copula (for NASDAQ-DOW and FF-DM) and Frank copula (for JY-DM) over the independent copula (i.e., multivariate normal distribution) indicates that the conditional joint distributions of these three pairs of equity and FX return series are not bivariate normal. Table 2 also presents the estimated shape parameters ˆα, their robust standard errors, and the corresponding ˆσ12. For FF-DM, the estimated shape parameters for the Gumbel Survival copula and Joe-Clayton copula are very signiﬁcant. For JY-DM, the estimated shape pa- rameter of Frank copula is 8.44 in Frank-DCC, 8.38 in Frank-VC and 6.98 in Frank-BEKK, 10 and all signiﬁcantly positive, indicating the remaining dependence in the standardized un- correlated errors et is strong, positive, and symmetric in both tails. 5.2 Out-of-sample predictive ability Suppose there are l + 1 models in a set of the competing density forecast models, possibly misspeciﬁed. We compare l = 6 C-MGARCH models with the benchmark MGARCH model. Let these models be indexed by j (j =0, 1,... , l =6) with the jth density forecast model denoted by ψj t (rt; ˆθj R,t−1). The benchmark model is indexed with j =0. If a bivariatedensity forecast model ψt(rt; θ0) coincides with the true density ϕt(rt)almostsurelyfor some θ0∈ Θ, then the one-step-ahead density forecast is said to be optimal because it dominates all other density forecasts for any loss functions (Diebold et al., 1998; Granger and Pesaran, 2000). As in practice it is rarely the case that we can ﬁnd an optimal model, our task is to investigate which density forecast model approximates the true conditional density most closely. If a metric is deﬁned to measure the distance of a given model to the truth, we then compare diﬀerent models in terms of this distance. Following Bao et al. (2005), we compare C-MGARCH models by comparing the condi- tional Kullback-Leibler information criterion (KLIC), It ¡ ϕ : ψj, θ¢ = Eϕt ln[ϕt (yt) /ψj t ¡ yt; θj¢ ], where the expectation is with respect to the true conditional density ϕt (·|Ft−1). Fol- lowing White (1994), we deﬁne the distance between a density model and the true den- sity as the minimum KLIC, It(ϕ : ψj, θ∗j t−1)= Eϕt ln[ϕt (yt) /ψj t (yt; θ∗j t−1)], where θ∗j t−1 = arg min It ¡ ϕ : ψj, θj¢ is the pseudo-true value of θj.To estimate θ∗j t−1, we split the data into two parts — one for the estimation and the other for out-of-sample validation. At each period t in the out-of-sample period (t = R +1,... ,T ), we use the previous R rolling ob- servations {yt−1,... ,yt−R} T t=R+1 to estimate the unknown parameter vector θ∗j t−1 and denote theestimateas ˆθj R,t−1. 4 Under some regularity conditions, we can consistently estimate θ∗j t−1 by ˆθj R,t−1 by maximizing R−1 Pt s=t−R+1 ln ψj s ¡ ys; θj¢ . See White (1994) for the sets of conditions for the existence and consistency of ˆθj R,t−1. Using {ˆθR,t−1} T t=R+1, we can obtain the out-of-sample estimate of EIt(ϕ : ψj, θ∗j t−1)by IR,n(ϕ : ψ) ≡ P −1 PT t=R+1 ln[ϕt(yt)/ψj t (yt; ˆθj R,t−1)], where P ≡ T − R is the size of the out- of-sample period. Since the KLIC takes a smaller value when a model is closer to the truth, 4Alternatively, θ∗ t−1 canbeestimated basedonthe wholesubsample {yt−1,.. . , y1} or a ﬁxed sample {yR,... ,y1}. 11 we can regard it as a loss function.

(2005) note that the out-of-sample average of the KLIC-diﬀerential between the benchmark model 0 and model j is then simply the log ratio of the predictive likelihoods IR,n(ϕ : ψ0) − IR,n(ϕ : ψj)= 1 P TX t=R+1 ln[ψj t (yt; ˆθj R,t−1)/ψ0 t (yt; ˆθ0 R,t−1)]. (13) When we compare multiple l C-MGARCH models using various copulas against a benchmark MGARCH model, the null hypothesis of interest is that no C-MGARCH model is better than the benchmark MGARCH. White (2000) proposes a test statistic and the bootstrap procedure to compute its p-value. Table 3 reports the density forecast comparison in terms of the out-of-sample KLIC together with the reality check p-values. In general, the in-sample results in Table 2 and the out-of-sample results in Table 3 are consistent, in that the in-sample ranking across the C-MGARCH models is carried over to the out-of-sample predictive ranking of the models. For NASDAQ-DOW and for FF-DM, the density forecast comparison conﬁrms the non- normality. For all three families (DCC, VC, BEKK), the independent copula yields the smallest (worst) predictive likelihood among all seven C-MGARCH models. The predictive superiority of C-MGARCH models based on Gumbel Survival copula or Joe-Clayton copula over the MGARCH model based on the independent copula (MGARCH under the bivariate normal distribution) is marginally signiﬁcant for NASDAQ-DOW (with the reality check p-values 0.087, 0.095, 0.195, respectively for DCC, VC, BEKK families) and is strongly signiﬁcant for FF-DM (with the reality check p-values 0.002, 0.000, 0.008 respectively for DCC, VC, BEKK families). For these two pairs of return series, Gumbel Survival or Joe- Clayton C-MGARCH is signiﬁcantly better than the benchmark even after accounting for potential bias due to the speciﬁcation search. For JY-DM, the independent copula yields one of the worst predictive likelihood. The largest (best) predictive likelihood is obtained from the Frank C-MGARCH for all three families. The result for JY-DM is weaker than for FF-DM, as the reality check p-values are 0.184, 0.144, 0.181, respectively for DCC, VC, BEKK families. This result is consistent with the results of Chen and Fan (2005, Section 6.1), who ﬁnd much stronger rejection of normality for FF-DM than for JY-DM. They also ﬁnd much stronger tail dependence for FF-DM than for JY-DM. 12 6 Conclusions In this paper we propose a new MGARCH model, namely, the C-MGARCH model. The C-MGARCH model includes a conventional MGARCH modelasaspecialcase. TheC- MGARCH model is to exploit the fact that the uncorrelated errors are not necessarily in- dependent. The C-MGARCH model permits modeling the conditional covariance for the non-elliptically distributed ﬁnancial returns, and at the same time separately modeling the dependence structure beyond the conditional covariance. While we have considered here only a bivariate system, the extension to a higher dimension is straightforward. We compare the C-MGARCH models with the corresponding MGARCH models using the three ﬁnancial data sets — a pair of the U.S. equity indices and two pairs of the foreign exchange rates. The empirical results from the in-sample and out-of-sample analysis clearly demonstrate the advantages of the new model. 7 Appendix We present here some details on copula functions for two widely used copula families — elliptical copula family and Archimedean copula family. The former includes the Gaussian copula and the Student’s t copula. The later includes Gumbel copula, Clayton copula and Frank copula. We also discuss the survival copulas of Archimedean copulas and Joe-Clayton copula. 7.1 Elliptical copulas Gaussian copula:Let R be the symmetric, positive deﬁnite correlation matrix and ΦR(·, ·) be the standard bivariate normal distribution with correlation matrix R. The density func- tion of bivariate Gaussian copula is: c Gaussian(u, v)= 1 |R|1/2 exp(−1 2η0(R −1−I)η), (14) where η =(Φ −1(u) Φ −1(v)) 0 and Φ −1(·) is the inverse of the univariate normal CDF. The bivariate Gaussian copula is: CGaussian(u, v; R)= ΦR ¡ Φ −1(u), Φ −1(v) ¢ . 13 Hu (2003) shows the bivariate Gaussian copula can be approximated by Taylor expansion: CGaussian(u, v; ρ) ≈uv + ρφ(Φ −1(u))φ(Φ −1(v)), where φ is the density function of univariate Gaussian distribution and ρ is the correla- tion coeﬃcient between η1 and η2. Both the upper tail dependence λU and the lower tail dependence λL are zero, reﬂecting the asymptotic tail independence of Gaussian copula. Student’s t copula:Let ωc be the degree of freedom, and TR,ωc(·, ·) be the standard bivariate Student’s t distribution with degree of freedom ωc and correlation matrix R.The density function of bivariate Student’s t copula is: c Student’s t(u, v; R, ωc)= |R| − 1 2 Γ( ωc+2 2 )Γ( ωc 2 ) Γ( ωc+1 2 )2 (1 + η0R−1η ωc ) − ωc+2 2 Π 2 i=1(1 + η2 i ωc ) − ωc+1 2 where η =(t −1 ωc (u),t −1 ωc (v)) 0,u = tω1(x),v = tω2(y), and tωi(·) is the univariate Student’s t CDF with degree of freedom ωi. The bivariate Student’s t copula is CStudent’s t(u, v; R, ωc)= TR,ωc ¡ t −1 ωc (u),t −1 ωc (v) ¢ . The upper tail dependence λU of Student’s t copula is λU =2−2tωc+1 ¡√ ωc +1 √ 1 − ρ/ √ 1+ ρ ¢ , where ρ is the oﬀ-diagonal element of R. Because of the symmetry property, the lower tail dependence λL can be obtained easily. 7.2 Archimedean copulas Archimedean copula can be expressed as C(u, v)= ϕ −1(ϕ(u)+ ϕ(v)), where ϕ is a convex decreasing function, called generator. Diﬀerent generator will induce diﬀerent copula in the family of Archimedean copula. The Kendall’s τ =1 + 4 Z 1 0 ϕ(u) ϕ0(u)du. Gumbel copula: The generator for Gumbel copula is ϕα(x)=(− ln x) α.For 1 ≤α < ∞ (α = 1 for independence and α →∞ for more dependence), the CDF and PDF for Gumbel copula are CGumbel(u, v; α)= exp{−[(− ln u) α +(− ln v) α]1/α}, c Gumbel(u, v; α)= CGumbel(u, v; α)(ln u ln v) α−1{[(− ln u) α +(− ln v) α]1/α + α − 1} uv[(− ln u)α +(− ln v)α]2−1/α . 14 The Kendall’s τ for Gumbel copula is τ =1 − 1 α. This one-to-one mapping relationship between τ and α clearly shows the shape parameter α controlling the dependence structure. The dependence structure of Gumbel copula are asymmetric: λU =2 − 2 1/α and λL =0. The survival copula of Gumbel copula has mirror image to Gumbel copula. Its CDF and PDF are CGS(u, v; α)= u + v − 1+exp{−[(− ln(1 − u)) α +(− ln(1 − v)) α] 1/α}, α ∈ [1, ∞) c GS(u, v; α)= c Gumbel(1 − u, 1 − v; α). The Kendall’s τ for Gumbel survival copula is τ =1 − 1 α. Gumbel Survival copula has the positive lower tail dependence: λU =0 and λL =2 − 2 1/α. Clayton copula: The generator for Clayton copula is ϕα(x)= x−α−1 α .For α ∈ [−1, ∞)\\{0}, the CDF and the PDF for Clayton copula are CClayton(u, v; α)=(u −α + v−α − 1) −1/α, c Clayton(u, v; α)= (1 + α)(u −α + v−α − 1) − 1 α −2 (uv)α+1 . The Kendall’s τ for Clayton copula is α α+2. The upper tail dependence λU =0 and the lower tail dependence is λL =2 −1/α. Joe-Clayton copula nests Clayton copula as a special case. The CDF of Joe-Clayton copula is CJoe-Clayton(u, v; α1, α2)= 1 − ³ 1 − © [1 − (1 − u) α1]−α2 +[1 − (1 − v) α1] −α2 − 1 ª−1/α2´1/α1 . When α1 = 1, Joe-Clayton copula generates to Clayton copula. Frank copula: The generator for Frank copula is ϕα(x)= − ln( e−αx−1 e−α−1 ). For α ∈ R\\{0}, the CDF and PDF for Frank copula are CFrank(u, v; α)= − 1 α log ∙1 − (1 − e −αu)(1 − e −αv) (1 − e−α) ¸ , c Frank(u, v; α)= α(1 − e −α)e −α(u+v) [(1 − e−α) − (1 − e−αu)(1 − e−αv)]2 . The dependence structure described by Frank copula is symmetric: α > 0for positive dependence, α → 0 for independence, and α < 0 for negative dependence. 15 References Bao, Y., T.-H. Lee, and B.

The best model for each family with the largest value of the out-of-sample average predictive likelihood is in bold font. For each of DCC, VC, BEKK families, seven C-MGARCH models are recursively estimated to generate P one-step density forecasts over the out-of-sample validation samples. We use the rolling window of size R to train the forecasting models with R = 1009, 1009, 1007 for the three data sets. The seven copulas used are Independent copula (denoted as I), Gumbel copula (G), Gumbel Survival copula (GS), Joe-Clayton copula (JC), Clayton copula (C), Clayton Survival copula (CS), and Frank copula (F). The range of the out-of- sample is from January 4, 2001 to December 31, 2001 (P = 248) for NASDAQ and Dow-Jones, from January 7, 1997 to December 31, 1998 (P = 500) for French Franc and Deutschemark, and from January 5, 1997 to December 31, 1997 (P = 250) for Japanese Yen and Deutschemark. For reality check, we use 1000 bootstrap samples with the mean block size of the “stationary bootstrap” equal to 5 days (a week), i.e., with the stationary bootstrap parameter q = 0.2. The benchmark model in each family is the independent copula model. “White” refers to the bootstrap reality check p-value of White (2000) and “Hansen” refers to the bootstrap reality check p-value of Hansen (2001). As discussed in Hansen (2001), White's reality check p- value may be considered as an upper bound of the true p-value. Hansen (2001) considers a modified reality check test to improve the size and the power of the test. White’s p-value and Hansen’s p-value may be the same, as is the case in this table. Nevertheless, we report both.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
