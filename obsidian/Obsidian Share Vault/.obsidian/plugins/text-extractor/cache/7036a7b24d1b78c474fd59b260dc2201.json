November 10, 2024 4 min 2870 By Youyou Zhou and Heather Long Donald Trump won more votes than he had before almost everywhere in the United States. Voters shifted right in rural areas, in suburbs and e York City. But it’s the urban areas that should unnerve Democrats most. These places are led by liberal mayors and city councils. They are dive are economically powerful. Take a look at America’s 50 biggest local economies (as measured by gross domestic product in 2022). In 2020, Trump won only one of them. took nine and made significant gains in nearly all of them. He flipped Miami, Phoenix (Maricopa County), Orange County (near Los Angeles) a County on Long Island. It was the best showing in urban areas for a Republican since 2004. His gains reversed an urban shift toward Democra seemed locked in since the Obama years. How the counties with the largest economies voted Each dot represents one of the top 50 counties sized and listed by GDP. In 2020, all but one went Democratic. \u0000is year, nine of them voted Republican.

Though Trump is known for his appeal in left-behind parts of America, in this election, voters in the wealthiest places made the biggest shift to Republicans. Democrats lost 3.7 percent of American voters overall compared with 2020, and they lost 4.2 percent of those who live in areas where the med household income is over $105,000. These include urban and suburban places such as San Francisco, San Jose (Santa Clara County), Seattle ( County), and Long Island. What happened? In large part, the shift reflects how much voters hate inflation. Across all income groups, they registered their frustration with economy under Biden. Trump gained new voters across all income areas — but the wealthiest areas gave him the largest boost Republican candidate’s vote share by county’s median household income Democrat’s vote share 60% Under $60K 60% 59 56 55 55% 55 A $ $60-75K 5453 51 $ 50 $75-105K 48 45 45 Above $105K 43% $ 40 42 U $ Trump gained more votes in higher-income counties than he did 2016. 39 4140 39%2012 2016 2020 2012 2016 2020 Sources: AP, Dave Leip’s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections, and 2023 American Community Survey Source: AP, Bureau of Economic Analysis, author analysis Counties with the highest cost of living shied most toward Trump COUNTY’S COST OF LIVING CHANGE IN TRUMP’S VOTE SHARE FROM 2020 (IN PERCENTAGE POINTS) Top 5% Top 10% +4.6 80-90% +2.2 70-80% +2.3 60-70% +2.2 50%-60% +2.2 40-50% +2.7 30-20% +2.2 20-30% +2.3 10-20% +2.8 Bottom 10% +3.7 NOTE: ﬔe cost-of-living percentiles are calculated based on the county-level regional price parities data of 2022 from the Bureau of Economic Analysis However, said John Lettieri, president of the Economic Innovation Group, “the places that shifted the hardest to Trump were the largest, most places.” Lettieri’s team was early to identify how, during the pandemic, people with young children left cities in a “family flight” for larger homes with y suburbs, where their money went further. In this election, the city-dwellers who stayed behind voiced their frustration at the ballot box. The pandemic hurt high-cost urban areas in other ways, too. Long lockdown periods made it especially difficult to bounce back. Some cities ex crime spikes. And although violent crime has fallen back to pre-pandemic levels in most places, unease persists. This has influenced mayoral e San Francisco just elected a new mayor, and North Miami’s mayoral race is going to a runoff. Urban areas with large non-White populations seem to have felt the most frustration. Much has been written about how Hispanic men were dr Trump in this election. But in cities, there’s more to it than that. The data suggests that urban, non-White, working-class people have been turn from Democrats and increasingly voting Republican for the past few election cycles.

Democrats will spend months thinking about what all of this means. Globally, incumbents faced a backlash during the worldwide inflation spik suggests that small changes in policy or campaigning would not have made much difference in the U.S. election. But as Democrats look forwar confront an urgent need to reconnect with working-class voters. A good place to start would be in urban areas. Mayors and city councils would be wise to focus their attention on the cost of housing. This has long been a top concern in New York City, and worries the entire country. Local leaders can influence how many homes are built in their communities by adjusting zoning rules and building “build, build, build” agendas won’t solve Democrats’ problem entirely, but they are a good place to start. If Democrats can’t again appeal to non-White and working-class voters in cities, this election might signal the start of a long deterioration in th voter base.
