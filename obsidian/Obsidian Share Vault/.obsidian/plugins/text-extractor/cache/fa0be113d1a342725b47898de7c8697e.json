This study integrates the service computing paradigm in smart grid domain and proposes a demand side personalised recommendation system (PRS). The proposed PRS employs service recommendation techniques to infer residential users’ potential interests and needs on energy saving appliances, and then it recommends energy saving appliances to users, therefore potentially creating opportunities to save energy for the grid. The proposed approach starts by applying a non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NILM) method based on generalised particle filtering to disaggregate the end users’ household appliance utilisation profiles from the smart meter data. Based on the NILM results, several inference rules are applied to infer the preferences and energy consumption patterns, and to form the user profile. In parallel, information retrieval techniques are applied to extract keywords from the textual appliance advertisements (Ads), and to define the appliance profile. Finally, the similarity measurement method is applied to compare the user profile and appliance profile, to rank the appliance Ad, and to make the recommendations. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed system. 1Introduction Emerging technologies in power industry and rapid developments of smart grid provide unprecedented capabilities for different grid participants to optimise the grid operation and generate large data volumes [1, 2]. The latter could be produced from a wide range of deployed sensors, e.g. advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and phasor measurement units depending on the adopted data rate collection. For example, a provincial utility grid in China can reach 20 million metres. If one considers the data is collected every 5-15  min, this grid alone will generate about 1 terabyte per day [3]. It is meaningless to solely collect and store the big data generated in the grid. The knowledge and patterns need to be extracted from the data to support the decision making of the different parties in the grid [2]. From the demand side, the large available datasets provide opportunities for the utility to obtain more residential information and develop efficient demand side management (DSM) programs. 1.1 State-of-the-art of DSM and home energy management system Current DSM techniques can be generally categorised into two classes: incentive-based DSM techniques (or direct load control, DLC) [4] and pricing-based techniques (or indirect load control) [5]. In DLC programs, the utility directly controls the residential resources [e.g. appliances, electric vehicles (EVs), etc.] through the remote controllers, so as to reshape the load demand profiles for different grid-level application, e.g. [6, 7]. As the subsidy, the utility often provides users with incentives or rewards. In the pricing-based DSM programs, the utility sets up electricity price signals to stimulate end users to actively adjust their appliance utilisation patterns. For example, driven by the price differences, users could choose to use more electrical appliances during the valley load period than during the peak load period, and the grid could thus shift the peak load. Comparing with the pricing-based DSM, DLC programs can reshape the load demand with a more reliable pattern, because the utility can directly control the appliances. However, a challenge in the implementation of DLC programs relies on its ability to recognise the users’ appliance usage habits and to minimise the disturbances to the users. The pricing-based DSM programs require little intrusion to the end users, but the responses of end users to the pricing signals are essentially stochastic and sometimes hard to predict. The design of an optimal price structure (e.g. time-of-use scheme, real-time pricing, and critical peak pricing) is a major concern in the pricing development of DSM programs. Many home energy management systems (HEMSs) have been proposed and developed over time aimed at improving the energy consumption efficiency of residential users. For example, we designed optimal control strategies for home air conditioners [6, 8, 9]; the authors in [10] scheduled the battery energy storage system (BESS) and appliances with solar penetrations; in [11], a load commitment framework was proposed to minimise the household operation costs. The HEMS can be operated at different demand response (DR) levels [12]: manual DR level, semi-automatic DR level, and fully-automatic DR level. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing HEMSs are developed for the semi-automatic and fully-automatic DR environments, and none is designed for implementation in a manual DR environment. Existing HEMSs relies on the home local area communication network and automatic appliance controllers. Although these techniques have been experiencing rapid developments, they are still not widely deployed in majority of today's residential houses. In this study, we show that even in the manual DR environment, there is an opportunity to design a new typology of HEMSs. The particularity of these latter HEMSs is to improve the household energy consumption not through the direct device control approach, but through capturing the users’ potential interests, preferences, and needs, and to recommend energy-aware products/ services to the users. This special kind of HEMS is referred to in this paper as ‘demand side recommender system’, whose core technology belongs to the family of service recommendation (SR) techniques, as explained in the following. 1.2 Demand side recommender system SR technique [13–15] is one of the core techniques of service computing, and has attracted significant attentions in both IT IET Gener. Transm. Distrib., 2017, Vol. 11 Iss. 7, pp. 1786-1793 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017 1786 academia and industry. SR techniques learn users’ preferences based on some prior knowledge. It then searches out the items (e.g. movies, web pages, services, etc.) in which the users could be mostly interested, and recommend them to the users. Many personalised recommendation systems (PRSs) have been developed in the last decades, e.g. [16, 17]. SR techniques provide powerful tools to discover useful residential information and improve the demand side energy efficiency. By analysing the residential data, SR techniques can automatically learn the users’ energy consumption preferences, interests, and necessities, and then recommend personalised energy aware products/services to the target user. Such energy aware products/services could be energy saving appliances, energy consumption suggestions, electricity retail plan, etc. It is noticeable that the demand side PRS can well operate either in the manual DR environment or work with other types of HEMSs in the semi- automatic or fully-automatic DR environment. In our recent work [18], we discussed the vision and potential applications of applying SR techniques in smart grid. The work in this paper can be therefore considered as one of the specific implementations of the applications discussed in [18]. In this paper, we propose a demand side PRS to recommend energy saving appliances suitable for residential users. The design objective of the proposed PRS is to implicitly infer the users’ needs and preferences on the appliances, and stimulate users to buy the energy saving appliances, so as to potentially reduce the energy consumption for the grid, reduce the end users’ energy consumption costs, and ensuring the satisfaction of end users. Nowadays, some energy organisations have started to recommend energy saving appliances to the residential users. For example, the Alabama Power in the USA [19] posts different energy saving appliance information on its website, and encourages users to purchase; the smart home business company, Plotwatt [20], uses the non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NILM) technique to detect the faults of the user's appliances, and the recommend energy saving styles for the user to replace. The proposed PRS is based on the content-based recommendation technique. Its implementation starts by applying NILM methods to automatically disaggregate the smart meter data into the utilisation profiles of individual appliances. Based on the NILM results, each user's appliance consumption patterns and appliance preferences are then inferred into a user profile. In parallel, the PRS automatically processes the collected textural appliance advertisements (Ads) and uses the information retrieval (IR) techniques to represent each Ad as an appliance profile. A similarity measurement is then applied to compare the user profile and appliance profile, and rank the appliance Ads. The Ads with highest ranks will be finally recommended to the user. This paper is organised as follows. Key features of the proposed recommender system, i.e. appliance utilisation monitoring and SR, are introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, the design of the proposed recommender system is described, followed by the experimental studies given in Section 4. Finally, conclusions and future thoughts are provided in Section 5. 2Key features of the recommender system The proposed PRS builds on two techniques that are briefly introduced in this section and that consist of appliance load monitoring technique and SR technique. 2.1 Appliance utilisation monitoring One way to monitor appliance load is through the sub-metering of appliances of interest. Such method is accurate, but the meter installation process is neither trivial nor economically efficient. Ideally, utilisation of appliance should be identified through only one real-time measurement point located at main circuit level, as suggested in 1992 by Hart [21] and usually denoted as the NILM technique. Generally, NILM techniques can be categorised into two classes: event-based approach and non-event-based approach. The event-based approach identifies the ON/OFF switch events of individual appliances based on different power signatures. For example, real and reactive powers are used in [21] as power signature to identify switching events of different appliance; harmonic is used in [22] to further discriminate appliances with similar real and reactive power; transient start-up patterns [23] and V–I trajectory from voltage and current waveform are also used for ON/OFF event awareness. The non-event-based approach infers the most appropriate interpretation based on the aggregated time series. Unlike event- based approach, the non-event-based approach does not need the customised hardware interface, and only relies on the total power measurements with the sampling intervals from 1 s to even 1 h. For example, a sparse coding technique was applied on the aggregated hourly data to estimate the appliance demand composition [24]; aggregated power measurement of 10 min interval was trained to perform NILM using the machine learning techniques [25]; hidden Markov model (HMM) was also widely used to formulate appliance operating cycle to realise energy disaggregation [26]. 2.2 Service recommendation A recommendation problem can be generally deduced to the problem of estimating ratings for the items that have been not seen by a user. The recommendation techniques are usually classified as two categories: content-based recommendations and collaborative recommendations [13]. Content-based recommendations identify and send text-based items to an user if regarded as similar to items preferred by the user in the past [13]. For example, a book recommendation system will try to learn the commonalities among the books which have been highly rated by a specific user in the past. Then the books which have a high degree of similarity to whatever the user's preferences will be selected and recommended to the user. The content-based recommendations often establish user profiles which contain the users’ tastes, preferences, and needs, and also generate item profiles to represent features of the items. The user profiles can be generated explicitly (e.g. through questionnaires) or implicitly leaned from the users’ historical behaviours. The item profiles are often represented by keyword vectors. A certain scoring algorithm is then applied to calculate the similarity between a user profile and item profile and score the items. Unlike content-based recommendations, collaborative recommendations try to predict the score of items for a particular user based on the items previously rated by other users. In other words, collaborative recommendations find the ‘peers’ of a specific user who have similar tastes. Then, only the items that are most preferred by the ‘peers’ will be recommended. Generally, there are two classes of collaborative recommendation algorithms [27]: memory-based algorithms and model-based algorithms. Memory- based algorithms are heuristics which make rating predictions for the targeted user based on the collection of historical rated items by the other users. Model-based algorithms learn a model from the historical rated items by the other users, and then use the model to make rating predictions. In our previous works [16], we designed a collaborative filtering electronic movie recommendation system, based on the support vector machine and improved particle swarm optimisation. In recent years, some hybrid recommendation techniques have been also proposed to combine both the merits of content-based and collaborative recommendations. More comprehensive review of the recommendation techniques can be found in [13]. 3Design of personalised energy saving household appliance recommender system The primary objective of the proposed PRS is to recommend energy saving appliances to users based on the analysis of their energy consumption patterns. The prices and functional characteristics of the appliances are also taken into account. The content-based recommendation technique is used in the proposed PRS. That is, users’ needs and interests on the household appliances are learned from their daily appliance utilisation profiles, and the energy saving appliances which mostly match the users’ interests and needs are found out from the existing collection IET Gener. Transm. Distrib., 2017, Vol. 11 Iss. 7, pp. 1786-1793 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017 1787 of appliance Ads. The working mechanism of the proposed PRS is presented below. i. an Energy Saving Appliance Knowledge Database (ESAKD) is established and stores representative Ad samples of different types of energy saving appliance. Those samples are manually collected from the E-shopping websites and recognised as energy saving styles based on the expert knowledge. For each type of appliance, the Ad samples in ESAKD are classified as different classes based on their functional descriptions. ii. The household energy consumption data are collected by the AMI infrastructure; and then, the NILM technique is applied to automatically disaggregate the household energy consumption data to be individual appliance utilisation data. iii. The personal and/or household information of the end users are collected. In practical application, the utility can obtain this data implicitly from the account records of the end users or explicitly from the user survey. The personal/household data of end users are saved into the User Knowledge Database (UKD) together with the NILM results. iv. Based on the appliance utilisation data, a rule-based inference system is designed to infer the potential interests and needs of the users on energy saving appliances. For a target user, based on the inferred interests, k appliance Ads are randomly selected from the corresponding categories in the ESAKD. These Ad samples are considered as the inferred Ads in which the user could be highly interested. The keywords of the k Ad samples are then extracted to generate the user profile. Meanwhile, the PRS processes the appliance Ads from the E-shopping websites and organise them as item profiles by using the IR technique. v. The appliance Ads are ranked by calculating the similarity between the corresponding user profile and item profile, and the top n Ads are recommended to the target user. vi. The schematic of the proposed PRS is depicted in Fig. 1. The proposed system infers the users’ interests based on their appliance utilisation information, and can be considered as a new type of non-intrusive recommender system [13]. In the following subsections, the implementation of each critical component of the proposed system is presented. 3.1 Establishment of ESAKD ESAKD stores pre-collected representative energy saving appliance Ad samples. These Ad samples will be used later to represent the users’ interests on appliances and generate the user profiles. The Ads in ESAKD are separately stored for each type of appliance. And for each type of appliance, the Ads are identified as two classes based on their functional characteristics based on the expert knowledge: ‘deluxe’ style and ‘economical’ style, as shown in Table 1. The ‘deluxe’ style appliances are those that possess more sophisticated functions and are available at higher prices, while the ‘economical’ style appliances have usually simpler functions and lower prices. In this study, we artificially collect representative energy saving appliance Ads from the E-shopping websites Amazon [28] and E- Bay [29]. These Ads cover different types of appliances, including washing machines, microwave, and others. 3.2 Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring A HMM-based NILM method [30] is implemented in the proposed recommender system and its main principles are presented below. 3.2.1 Appliance modelling by HMM: The first step of NILM is to estimate individual appliance model from total power consumption series. It is appropriate to model each appliance as a standalone HMM or HMM variants such as semi-HMM, conditional HMM, etc. The most basic HMM considers that an appliance has K operating states 1, 2, …, K , alternating through these states during its operating cycle. For the discretised Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of the energy saving appliance recommender system Table 1 Basic structure of ESAKD appliance type 1 deluxe ad1,C1,1, ad1,C1,2,…,ad1,C1,m economical ad1,C2,1, ad1,C2,2,…,ad1,C2,m appliance type 2 deluxe ad2,C1,1, ad2,C1,2,…,ad2,C1,m economical ad2,C2,1, ad2,C2,2,…,ad2,C2,m … … … appliance type n deluxe adn,C1,1, adn,C1,2,…,adn,C1,m economical adn,C2,1, adn,C2,2,…,adn,C2,m adi,t,j denotes the jth ad sample of the class t of appliance type i. 1788 IET Gener. Transm. Distrib., 2017, Vol. 11 Iss. 7, pp. 1786-1793 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017 observation period with T time steps, sequential power consumption of the appliance is measured as x = x1, x2, …, xT, corresponding to a sequence of latent appliance operational states z = z1, z2, …, zT. The HMM can be described by three sets of parameters that are: (a) Prior probability vector of initial state π ∈ R K, which represents the probability with which the appliance is at state i at the first time step πi = p(z1 = i) (1) (b) Transition matrix A ∈ R K × K, whose element Ai, j represents the probability with which an appliance will transit state from i at t−1 to j at t Ai, j = p(zt = j | zt − 1 = i) (2) (c) Emission vector e ei follows N(μzt, σzt) (3) where ei means the emission distribution of the ith hidden state. The Gaussian distribution could be applied to model the emission distribution. 3.2.2 Unsupervised HMM fitting: In the proposed PRS, the appliance model fitting should be unsupervised. We fit known electric appliance of the same category to form generic model for a type of appliance, and further tune the parameters of the generic model by using the unlabelled aggregated data. Extracting appliance power trace from aggregated data is achieved by calculating the likelihood of a period of aggregated data generated by a single appliance using its generic HMM model p(x | Θ) = ∫ ∫ L(x, z | θ)p(θ | Θ)dzdθ (4) where θ = π, A, E is the parameter of the appliance and Θ is the generic parameter of the appliance group and similar to θ. L(x, z | θ) is the joint likelihood defined as L(x, z | θ) = ∑ n = 1 N p(z1 | π) + ∑ t = 2 T ∑ n = 1 N p(zt | zt − 1, A) + ∑ t = 1 T p(xt | zt, e) (5) By using different lengths of window and calculating p(θ | Θ), if the likelihood is greater than a preset threshold, the data slice then is considered to be generated by the type of appliance governed by generic parameters Θ. This data slice is further used to tune the generic parameters into θ. 3.2.3 Disaggregation using learned model: Energy disaggregation is the most challenge part in the context of NILM. It involves solving all the latent operating states of all N appliances throughout the whole time series to maximise the joint likelihood z (1: N) = arg max z(1: N) L x, z(1: N) | θ(1: N) (6) Exact solution to this problem is intractable. A general solver based on particle filtering is used to approximate to the optimal assignment of the included appliances, whose details can be found in [31]. 3.3 User interest and need inference and representation 3.3.1 User interest and need inference: For each household, the NILM technique identifies the daily utilisation profiles of different appliances. A set of typical NILM results on a household is illustrated in Fig. 2. In addition to the NILM results, we also consider two kinds of household information: number of family members and average annual family income. The NILM data and household information are stored into the UKD. The adopted approach is also valid for implementation of demand side PRSs that make use of household energy consumption features. For the PRS proposed in this study, based on the UKD, we design a rule- based inference system to infer the users’ potential interests and needs on the energy saving appliances, which includes the following two steps: Step 1) We infer what types of energy saving appliances would be most needed by or of most interest to the target user. In this study, based on the NILM data of the target user, we select the appliance types to recommend based on following three criteria: (i) the appliance which consumes most daily energy in by the household; (ii) the most frequently used appliances of the household; and (iii) the appliance with most utilisation time in the household. In (ii) and (iii), when calculating the utilisation frequencies and utilisation time of the appliances, we do not consider the appliances which often need to be switched on all the time, such as the refrigerator. Step 2) After determining the types of appliances to recommend, we infer the functional category of each specific type of appliance based on the household information. This inference is based on following rules: the household will be recommended by ‘deluxe’ styled appliances if (i) the average family annual income is more than $150,000, or (ii) the average family annual income is between [$90,000, $150,000] and the number of family members is larger than three. In other cases, the household will be recommended by the appliances with economical styles. Generally, above rules reflect the ordinary intuitions of people's daily lives. For example, if a family has high income and many members, they probably need the ‘deluxe’ styled appliances to satisfy their daily requirements; if a family consists only one or two people with low income level, then they will probably be more interested in the ‘economical’ styled appliances. 3.3.2 User interest and need representation: After inferring the user's interests and needs, the user profile is generated to produce the recommendation. Based on the user interest inference results, we randomly select three representative energy saving Ads from the corresponding categories of ESAKD, and we use these representative appliance Ads to represent the users’ needs and interests. It should be noted that the users’ interests can also be obtained by other explicit methods (e.g. user survey) or implicit methods (e.g. learn users’ interests from their browsing historical records on the E-shopping websites) instead of using the interest inference and Fig. 2 Illustration of NILM results IET Gener. Transm. Distrib., 2017, Vol. 11 Iss. 7, pp. 1786-1793 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017 1789 representation methods in this paper. In those cases, the relationships between their appliance utilisation patterns (the NILM results) and appliance interests need to be learned. 3.4 Generation of user profile and item profile For each Ad (either the Ad in ESAKD or the candidate Ad), we first extract a set of features from the appliance textual descriptions, and represent each Ad as a vector of weighted keywords. The weight of each keyword represents the ‘importance’ or ‘informativeness’ of the keyword. To form the weighted keyword vector, in this study we use the best-known technique in IR, the term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) measure [32]. Assume there are totally N Ads and the keyword space is K, and assume the keyword kj appears in ni of the N Ads. Also, assume fi,j is the number of times keyword kj appears in Ad aj. Then, the normalised frequency of keyword ki in aj, TFi,j, is defined as TFi, j = f i, j maxz f z, j (7) where maxz f z, j is the maximum frequency over all keyword kz that appear in aj, while the inverse document frequency for keyword kj is calculated as IDFi = log N ni (8) Finally, the TF-IDF weight for keyword kj in Ad aj is wi, j = TFi, j ⋅ IDFi (9) For an appliance Ad to be recommended (referred as ‘candidate Ad’), its item profile is generated by directly using the weighted keyword vector calculated by above method. To generate the user profile, the three randomly selected representative Ads from corresponding categories of ESAKD are first transformed to weighted keyword vectors, and then the Rocchio algorithm [33] is used to form an average weighted keyword vector from the three vectors, which is used as the user profile. 3.5 Energy saving appliance recommendation For a given candidate Ad and a target user, the similarity of the user profile and item profile is calculated, which is used as the score of the candidate Ad. In this study, we use a widely adopted method in textual recommendation, i.e. cosine similarity measure [13], to do the similarity calculation. The similarity of an Ad a for a user u is calculated as score(u, a) = cos(wu, wa) = wu ⋅ wa ∥ wu ∥ 2 × ∥ wa ∥2 = ∑i = 1 K wi, uwi, a ∑i = 1 K wi, u 2 ∑i = 1 K wi, a 2 (10) where wu and wa are weighted keyword factors of the user profile and item profile, respectively. Finally, the candidate Ads are sorted in ascending order of their scores, and top n Ads are recommended to the target user. 4Experiment study An experimental study has been performed to validate the proposed prototype recommender system, considering the actual household appliance Ads collected from the E-shopping websites and simulated household energy consumption scenarios. All simulations are executed in a 64-bit DELL workstation with 128  GB memory and 2 Intel Xeon processors. 4.1 Data preparation 4.1.1 Preparation of household data: The simulation case includes 100 households. Multiple instances of six different types of home appliances are extracted from the popular REDD dataset [34]. Appliance instances are randomly picked from the appliance pool. Daily power consumption for each household is generated using the load profile generator proposed in the authors’ previous work [35]. NILM is then performed in each household to detect the appliance utilisation profiles. We then randomly generate the household configuration data for each house as following ranges: number of family members is within [1, 5], and family annual income is within [$50,000, $200,000]. 4.1.2 Preparation of appliance Ads: We consider six kinds of electrical appliances: dishwasher, refrigerator, washing machine, microwave oven, washer dryer, laundry dryer, and water heater. More types of appliances can be easily integrated into the proposed PRS. For each of the six kinds of appliances, we select ten representative energy saving styles for each class (‘deluxe’ and ‘economical’) from the websites of Amazon and Ebay, based on our experiences. Table 2 gives a typical advertisement of an energy saving refrigerator, which is also classified to be ‘economical’. Similarly, we manually collect 300 appliance Ads from the E- shopping websites as test data. These Ads are not restricted to the six appliance types considered in this paper, but cover a wide range types of appliances with different energy ratings, functions, and product descriptions. The PRS will automatically infer the user's interests and needs, and filter the 300 Ads to recommend correct ones to the users. For each Ad, we first remove the meaningless words (e.g. ‘the’, ‘a’, etc.); and then, we convert it as a keyword vector based on the keyword space, by using the TF-IDF calculation method described above. 4.2 Experiment results 4.2.1 NILM results: The accuracy of the ON/OFF event estimation for the six selected appliances across the 100 simulated households are given in Table 3. As it can be seen, water heater, dishwasher, and washing machine have better identification results than the rest, which are all above 95% so that we can account the NILM results for these three types of appliances quite confidently. On the other hand, the estimation on refrigerator is about 80%, while laundry dryer and microwave have just above 50% estimated results. The reason for the low average accuracy for these two types of appliances is mainly due to its relatively infrequent use, and the similarity in power consumption profile between the two. 4.2.2 Recommendation results: We then perform recommendations for the 300 collected appliance Ads on the 100 simulated residential users. Fig. 3 shows the recommendation results of a representative user. To better illustrate the recommendation results, Fig. 3 shows the basic household condition of the user and his/her daily appliance utilisation profiles identified by the proposed NILM method. Fig. 3 also shows the types of appliances which are selected to recommend by the proposed user interest inference and representation system.

Distrib., 2017, Vol. 11 Iss. 7, pp. 1786-1793 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017 product pictures of the six final recommended appliances are also attached. Fig. 3 also attaches the Ad descriptions of two products. From the energy consumption information, the PRS infers that the user could mostly need or be interested in the energy saving water heater, laundry dryer, and microwave oven. Based on the user's household condition, the PRS infers that the appliances with ‘Economic’ style are mostly suitable for the user. All the six recommended products in Fig. 3 are energy efficient style and with the class label of ‘economical’. Fig. 4 shows the frequencies of each Ad to be recommended. Although the collected 300 Ads consist of some other appliance types out of the six appliances types considered by our PRS, the experiment results show that none of the ‘noisy’ appliance Ads are recommended, which indicates the proposed PRS can correctly filter the information from the Ad collection. Therefore, in Fig. 4 we only report the recommendation frequencies of the Ads of the six considered appliances types. The results clearly show that refrigerator, microwave, and water heater are most frequently recommended appliances, and the recommendations concentrate on a certain number of energy saving Ads. Generally, the PRS can correctly filter the Ads and recommend energy saving styled appliances to the users, with rare mistakes (recommend non-energy saving styles, marked as a small purple sign on the bar). We further qualify the recommendation accuracy of the proposed PRS. In many conventional PRSs, the recommendation accuracy is validated by comparing the recommended products with the prior-known products in which the user is actually interested. In this study, since we do not directly have the user interest data but use an inference system to infer the user interests, we define the recommendation result accuracy criteria as: (i) types of the recommended appliances matches those inferred by the PRS; (ii) the recommended appliances are with prior-classified energy Table 3 NILM results for six types of appliances Appliance Accuracy for ON/OFF events, % microwave 51.7 water heater 98.3 dishwasher 98.6 refrigerator 80.4 washing machine 95.4 laundry dryer 55.6 average 80.0 Fig. 3 Energy saving appliance recommendation results of a sample user Fig. 4 Recommendation frequencies of the Ads on six types of appliances IET Gener.

Only when these three criteria are satisfied, a recommendation result is considered to be correct. Table 4 reports the recommendation accuracy of the 300 Ads of six types of appliances on 100 users. It shows that generally the proposed PRS has high accuracy. The recommendation accuracy of laundry dryer leads to a lower accuracy than the ones achieve other appliances. This is probably related to the quality of the collected textual Ad descriptions of the laundry dryer. 5Conclusions and future works In this paper, we introduce the SR technology into the smart grid domain to develop a demand side personalised recommender system. The proposed PRS is based on an implementation of the AMI and NILM techniques. Energy saving household appliances that could be most interested to or needed by residential users are recommended to the latter. Following points highlight some important aspects of the proposed PRS and provide directions for future work in this area. 5.1 Over specification problem One limitation of the content-based recommendation technique is that the user can only be recommended the items which are similar to the items with which the user has already experienced. For instance, in our recommender system, a user that has no previous experience with a dish washer will never be recommended one, although many investigations show that dish washer can save more water when compared with hand washing [36]. One approach to address this point is to introduce the collaborative recommendation technique into the recommender system to supplement the content- based recommendation technique. By doing this, the energy saving appliances used by similar users can be identified and recommended to the target user, even if he/she has on experience on them. 5.2 User interest and user response The recommendation quality of the proposed PRS can be further enhanced by designing a close-looped, iterative learning mechanism by utilising the users’ response information. By monitoring whether the user chooses to purchase the recommended energy saving appliances or not, the PRS can iteratively update its awareness on the user's interests and needs, and correspondingly revise the recommendation plan. The user response tracking can be also done in a non-intrusive manner by using the NILM method, i.e. by periodically checking the energy consumption profiles of the household appliances. 5.3 More smart grid recommender systems In the future, the SR techniques can be applied in many other fields. The authors are currently working on developing a collaborative-based recommender system to recommend suitable electricity retail plans to residential users based on the analysis of smart meter data. Another potential application could be to study the development of cost-effective appliance utilisation recommendation, i.e. recommending economic appliance utilisation schedules for a target user by analysing the appliance utilisation patterns of other users who have similar household conditions and choose similar pricing plans with the target user. Some real-time recommender systems could also be developed and studied. For instance, a recommender system can be developed to recommend real-time driving routes and charging schemes to the EV drivers by considering the real-time conditions of both transportation and distribution systems. 6Acknowledgments This work was supported in part by an Australian Research Council through its Future Fellowship scheme (FT140100130), in part by a Visiting Scholarship of State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment & System Security and New Technology (Chongqing University, China) (2007DA10512716401), and in part by the Early Career Research Development Scheme of the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Sydney, Australia.
