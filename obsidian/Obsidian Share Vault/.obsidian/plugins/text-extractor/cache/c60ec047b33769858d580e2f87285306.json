INTRODUCTION It is often required in multivariate analysis to construct a multivariate distribution from specified marginal distributions with a given dependence structure. Multivariate distributions with given marginals arise not only from statistical theory, but quite often from practical problems, especially in the context of risk and decision analysis for complex multivariate systems. Jouini and Clemen (1996) studied this kind of models for aggregating expert opinions and Frees et al. (1996) discussed an actuarial model for insurance applications. In recent years, many statisticians have studied multivariate distributions with specified structures (see, e.g., Dall’Aglio et al. (1991)). Krzysztofowicz and Kelly (1996) constructed the so-called meta- Gaussian distributions using the embedding method. The construction of the meta-Gaussian distributions is based on the copula technique. Copulas are functions which join univariate uniform distribution functions to form multivariate distributions. They were initially introduced by Sklar (1959). A historical review and major developments can be found in Dall’Aglio (1991), Schweizer (1991), and Kotz (1997) among others. Utilizing copulas, Kotz and Seeger (1991) observed that the density function of a multivariate distribution can be decomposed into the density weighting function and the product of marginal densities. In this paper, a wider class of continuous distributions with given marginals is discussed. In place of the normal distribution, elliptically con- toured distributions are considered as the basic framework and meta- Gaussian distributions are extended to meta-elliptical distributions. Definition 1.1. A n-dimensional random vector z is said to have an elliptically contoured distribution (or simply called elliptical distribution or ECD) with parameters m (n × 1) and S (n×n) if it has the stochastic repre- sentation z= d m+rAu, (1.1) where r \\ 0 is a random variable, u is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere in R n and is independent of r, A is an n×n constant matrix such that AAŒ=S and the sign = d means that both sides of the equality have the same distribution. In particular, if r has a density, then the density of z is of the form |S| − 1 2 g((z − m)Œ S −1(z − m)), (1.2) where g( · ) is a scale function uniquely determined by the distribu- tion of r. We shall use the notation z ’ ECn(m, S,g). When g(x)= (2p) −n/2 exp{ − x/2}, z has an n-dimensional normal distribution. Throughout this paper, without the loss of generality, we shall consider only the case z ’ ECn(0, R,g), where R={rij: rii=1, −1 < rij <1 for i ] j, rij=rji;i,j=1,...,n}. (1.3) 2 FANG, FANG, AND KOTZ In this case all the marginal distributions of z are identical with pdf qg(x)= p (n − 1)/2 C((n − 1)/2) F . x2 (y − x 2) (n − 1)/2 − 1 g(y) dy, (1.4) and the cdf Qg(x)= 1 2 + p (n − 1)/2 C((n − 1)/2) F x 0 F . u2 (y − u 2) (n − 1)/2 − 1 g(y) dy du. (1.5) Let x=(X1,X2,...,Xn)Œ be a random vector with each component Xi having a given continuous density fi(xi) and the cumulative distribution Fi(xi). Let the random vector z=(Z1,Z2, ..., Zn)Œ ’ ECn(0, R,g). Suppose that Zi=Q −1 g (Fi(Xi)), i=1, 2, ..., n, (1.6) where Q −1 g is the inverse of Qg. Then, the Jacobian of the transformation is J{(z1,...,zn)Œ Q (x1,...,xn)Œ}=D n i=1 dzi dxi=D n i=1 fi(xi) qg(Q −1 g (Fi(xi))), (1.7) and the density function of x is given by h(x1,...,xn)=f(Q −1 g (F1(x1)), ..., Q −1 g (Fn(xn)) D n i=1 fi(xi), (1.8) where f is the n-variate density weighting function f(z1, ..., zn)=|R| − 1 2 g(zŒS −1z) ; D n i=1 qg(zi) (1.9) (see below). Definition 1.2. The n-dimensional random vector x is said to have a meta-elliptical distribution, if its density function is given by (1.8). Denote x ’ MEn(0, R,g;F1,...,Fn). The function f(Q −1 g (F1(x1)), ..., Q −1 g (Fn(xn))) is referred to as the density weighting function. The class of meta-elliptical distributions includes various distributions, such as elliptically contoured distributions, the meta-Gaussian distributions and various asymmetric distributions. The marginal distributions Fi(·) can be arbitrarily chosen. As it will be shown in Example 4.1 below, a class of new distributions which is so-called a multivariate asymmetric t-distribution can be constructed by setting the marginals of multivariate t-distribution to META-ELLIPTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS 3 be univariate t-distributions with different degrees of freedom. Multivariate asymmetric t-distributions enjoy certain symmetry but the marginal degrees of freedom are different. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Copulas of ECDs are first discussed in the next section. The pdf of a meta-elliptical distribu- tion is determined by the marginal distributions and the density weighting function f(Q −1 g (x1), ..., Q −1 g (xn)), the latter being the copula density of an ECD. In Section 3, the structure and some relevant properties of meta- elliptical distributions are presented. Some applications of these new distributions are discussed in Section 4. 2. COPULAS OF BIVARIATE ELLIPTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS In this section, we shall discuss copulas of elliptical distributions. For simplicity, we shall consider only the two-dimensional case. Suppose z=(Z1,Z2)Œ ’ EC2(0, R,g), where R=R 1 r r 1S ,− 1 < r <1, (2.1) and z has the density function f(z1,z2; r)= 1 `1− r 2 g 1 z 2 1+z 2 2 −2rz1z2 `1− r 2 2. (2.2) The marginal pdf and cdf of z are qg(z)=F . z2 (y − z 2) −1/2 g(y) dy and Qg(z)= 1 2 +F . z2 arc sin 1 z `y2 g(y) dy, (2.3) respectively. In view of the Sklar theorem (see Sklar (1959)), we have Theorem 2.1. Let the bivariate vector z=(Z1,Z2)Œ possess an ellipti- cally contoured distribution with the density function (2.2). Then the copula of Z1 and Z2 is given by Cz(u, v)= 1 `1− r 2 F Q −1 g (u) −. F Q −1 g (v) −. g 1 x 2+y 2 −2rxy `1− r 2 2 dx dy, (2.4) 4 FANG, FANG, AND KOTZ with the density cz(u, v)=f(Q −1 g (u), Q −1 g (v); r), (2.5) where f(x, y; r)=f(x, y; r)/[qg(x) qg(y)]. (2.6) A proof follows directly from the definitions. To assess the correlation between two random variables, Spearman’s correlation coefficient rs,a measure of the average positive (and negative) quadrant dependence, is often utilized (see, e.g., Lovie (1995)). Theorem 2.2. Suppose z=(Z1,Z2)Œ ’ EC2(0, R,g) with pdf (2.2). Spearman’s rs between Z1 and Z2 is given by rs=12 F . −. F . −. Qg(x) Qg(y) f(x, y) dx dy − 3. (2.7) Proof. Since by definition rs=12 F [0, 1]2 {C(u, v) − uv} du dv and from Nelsen (1998) or by direct calculation F [0, 1]2 C(u, v) du dv=F [0, 1]2 uv dC(u, v), (2.7) follows (2.5) and some elementary manipulations. L Thus, Spearman’s rs in (2.7) depends not only on r, but also on the marginal cdf of z. Since the marginal distribution functions of many ellip- tically contoured distributions can not be expressed in closed forms, rs is usually obtained by means of numerical calculations. However, for a bivariate normal variable z, Kruskal (1958) obtained a simple expression for Spearman’s correlation coefficient: rs=(6/p) arc sin(r/2). Examples below provide copulas for some subclasses of elliptical distri- butions (see, e.g., Fang et al. (1990)). Figure 1 exhibits the form of different copula densities of these subclasses. Example 2.1. Symmetric Kotz type distributions. Let z be distributed according to a bivariate symmetric Kotz type distribution with density g1(x1,x2)= sr N/s(x 2 1+s 2 2 −2rx1x2) N−1 pC(N/s)(1 − r 2) N − 1/2 exp 3 −r 1 x 2 1+x 2 2 −2rx1x2 1− r 2 2 s4, (2.8) META-ELLIPTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS 5 FIG. 1.

The marginal pdf is q1(x)= 2sr N/s pC(N/s) F . 0 (t 2+x 2) N−1 exp{ − r(t 2+x 2) s} dt. Denote the corresponding cdf by Q1(x). Then the density of copula is c1(u, v)= g1(Q −1 1 (u), Q −1 1 (v)) q1(Q −1 1 (u)) q1(Q −1 1 (v)). (2.9) When N=s=1 and r= 1 2 , z possesses the bivariate normal distribution N2(0, R) and its copula density is given by Krzysztofowicz and Kelly (1996). L 6 FANG, FANG, AND KOTZ Example 2.2. Symmetric bivariate Pearson type VII distributions.If z has a symmetric bivariate Pearson type VII distribution, its density function is given by g2(x, y)= N−1 pm `1− r 2 3 1+ 1 m(1 − r 2) (x 2+y 2 −2rxy)4 −N , (2.10) where N>1, and m>0 are parameters. When N=m/2+1, z ’ Mt2(m, 0, R), the bivariate t-distribution with m degrees of freedom. It can be shown directly by integration that the marginal cdf of z is Q2(x)= C(N − 1/2) `pm C(N − 1) F x −. (1+y 2/m) −(N − 1/2) dy. The density of copula is then c2(u, v)=b2(Q −1 2 (u), Q −1 2 (v)), where b2(x, y)= C(N − 1) C(N) [C(N − 1/2)] 2 (1+x 2/m) (N − 1/2) (1+y 2/m) (N − 1/2) `1− r 2 {1+1/(m(1 − r 2))(x 2+y 2 −2rxy)} N. (2.11) Example 2.3. Symmetric bivariate Pearson type II distributions.

The marginal cdf of z is Q3(x)= C(m+2) `p C(m+3/2) F x −1 (1−y 2) m+1/2 dy, for |x| [ 1. The density of copula is then c3(u, v)=b3(Q −1 3 (u), Q −1 3 (v)), where b3(x, y)= (m+1)[C(m+3/2)] 2 [C(m+2)] 2 [1 − (1/(1 − r 2))(x 2+y 2 −2rxy)] m `1− r 2 (1−x 2) m+1/2 (1−y 2) m+1/2 . (2.13) 3. META-ELLIPTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS Meta-elliptical distributions have been defined in Section 1. In this section we will discuss some of their properties. First, two-dimensional META-ELLIPTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS 7 meta-elliptical distributions will be studied. Some properties can straigh- forwardly be extended to the multivariate case. Let x=(X1,X2)Œ ’ ME2(0, R,g;F1,F2) with density h(x1,x2; r)=f(Q −1 g (F1(x1)), Q −1 g (F2(x2)); r)f1(x1)f2(x2), (3.1) where f is as defined in (2.6), and Fi and fi are the cdf and pdf of Xi, respectively, i=1, 2. 3.1. Kendall’s Correlation Coefficient Since the expression of Spearman’s correlation coefficient rs is somewhat complicated for elliptically contoured distributions, it is more expedient to consider Kendall’s correlation coefficient y. Indeed, Kendall’s y is a measure of average total positivity (and reverse regularity) of order two (see, e.g., Nelsen (1992, 1998)). It is the difference between the probabilities of concordance and discordance for two independent and identically dis- tributed pairs of random variables. Let xi=(X1i,X2i)Œ and xj=(X1j,X2j)Œ be two independent and identically distributed pairs of random vectors. Kendall’s y of X1 and X2 can be written as (see, e.g., Kruskal (1958)) y=P[(X1i <X1j,X2i <X2j) or (X1i >X1j,X2i >X2j)] − P[(X1i <X1j,X2i >X2j) or (X1i >X1j,X2i <X2j)]. (3.2) Theorem 3.1. Let x=(X1,X2) have a meta-elliptical distribution with the density given in (3.1). Then Kendall’s y of X1 and X2 is given by y=2 p arcsin(r), (3.3) which depends only on r, and is invariant in the class of meta-elliptical distributions ME2(0, R,g;F1,F2). Proof. Denote y(x) the right side in (3.2). Then y(ax)=y(x) for all a >0. Since y(x) is determined by the copula of x, we can assume that x ¥ EC2(R). By Theorem 2.22 in Fang et al. (1990) the assertion follows from Kruskal (1958). L For the given marginal distributions F1(x1) and F2(x2), X1 and X2 result in perfect positive dependence or perfect negative dependence if we take r Q +1 or r Q −1, respectively. As r Q 1, the total probability mass under f is concentrated on the main diagonal line z1=z2; hence H(x1,x2), the joint distribution of X1 and X2, attains the upper Fréchet bound H*(x1,x2)=min {F1(x1), F2(x2)}.As r Q −1, the total probability mass 8 FANG, FANG, AND KOTZ under f becomes concentrated on the line z1=−z2; hence H(x1,x2) attains the lower Fréchet bound Hg(x1,x2)=max{0, F1(x1)+F2(x2)−1}. 3.2. Conditional Distribution The conditional density of X1 given X2=x2, denoted by k(x1 |x2), follows directly from (3.1): k(x1 |x2)=f(Q −1 g (F1(x1)), Q −1 g (F2(x2)); r)f1(x1). (3.4) Hence, the corresponding conditional distribution K(x1 |x2) is given by K(x1 |x2)= 1 2 +t 1 Q −1 g (F2(x2)), Q −1 g (F1(x1)) − rQ −1 g (F2(x2)) `1− r 2 2, (3.5) where t(a, b)= > b 0 g(y 2+a 2)dy > . 0 g(y 2+a 2)dy. Denote by x1(p|x2) the conditional p-quantile of X1 given X2=x2. Explicitly, K(x1(p | x2)|x2)=p. For p=0.5, we have from (3.5) t 1 Q −1 g (F2(x2)), Q −1 g (F1(x1)) − rQ −1 g (F2(x2)) `1− r 2 2=0. Since t(a, b)=0 implies that b=0, it follows that Q −1 g (F1(x1(0.5 | x2))) − rQ −1 g (F2(x2))=0, i.e., x1(0.5 | x2)=F −1 1 {Qg[rQ −1 g (F2(x2))]}. (3.6) The plot of x1(0.5 | x2) versus x2 defines the conditional median of X1, given X2=x2. The conditional median x1(0.5 | x2) is a monotone increas- ing function of x2 if r >0, and it is a monotone decreasing function of x2 if r <0. Moreover, we have the following Theorem 3.2 which is similar to one in the case of meta-Gaussian distributions (see Krzysztofowicz and Kelly (1996)). Theorem 3.2. Let (X1,X2) follow a meta-elliptical distribution with the marginal distributions F1(x1) and F2(x2). Then the graph {(x1(0.5 | x2), x2)} possesses the following properties: META-ELLIPTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS 9 (i) For r \\ 0, the graph is strictly increasing and lies within the region: F −1 1 (F2(x2))<x1(0.5 | x2)<F −1 1 (0.5) for x2 <F −1 2 (0.5), x1(0.5 | x2)=F −1 1 (0.5) for x2=F −1 2 (0.5), F −1 1 (0.5) < x1(0.5 | x2)<F −1 1 (F2(x2)) for x2 >F −1 2 (0.5). (3.7) (ii) For r [ 0, the graph is strictly increasing and lies within the region: F −1 1 (0.5) < x1(0.5 | x2)<F −1 1 (1 − F2(x2)) for x2 <F −1 2 (0.5). x1(0.5 | x2)=F −1 1 (0.5) for x2=F −1 2 (0.5), F −1 1 (1 − F2(x2))<x1(0.5 | x2)<F −1 1 (0.5) for x2 >F −1 2 (0.5). (3.8) A ‘‘judgmental’’ estimation procedure of r can be developed based on Theorem 3.2. For details the reader is referred to Krzysztofowicz and Kelly (1996). 3.3. Forms of Dependence Some stronger forms of dependence than the classical orthant depen- dence (Lehmann (1966)) are regression dependence and likelihood ratio dependence (see, e.g., Barlow and Proschan (1975), Krzysztofowicz and Kelly (1996)). Theorem 3.3. Let (X1,X2)Œ ’ ME2(0, R,g;F1,F2). Then, X1 and X2 are positively likelihood ratio dependent if r \\ 0 and are negatively likelihood ratio dependent if r [ 0. Proof. Let the density of (X1,X2) be h(x1,x2). If for all x1 <x − 1 and x2 <x − 2, h(x − 1,x2) h(x1,x − 2) [ h(x1,x2) h(x − 1,x − 2) (namely, the joint density h is totally positive of order two), then by defini- tion, X1 and X2 are positively likelihood ratio dependent. Since any strictly increasing transformation of the variates does not affect the positive (negative) likelihood ratio dependence, the theorem follows directly from the properties of elliptical distributions. L Theorem 3.4. Let (X1,X2)Œ ’ ME2(0, R,g;F1,F2). X1 is positively (negatively) regression dependent on X2 if and only if the conditional quantile x1(p|x2) is non-decreasing (non-increasing) in x2 for all p, 0<p<1. 10 FANG, FANG, AND KOTZ The proof of the theorem is similar to that of Theorem 2 of Krzysztofowicz and Kelly (1996). 3.4. Multivariate Case Let x=(X1,X2,...,Xn)Œ follow a meta-elliptical distribution with the density given by (1.8). Following Theorem 3.1, the Kendall’s correlation coefficient between Xi and Xj is yij=2 p arcsin(rij), for i ] j, i, j=1, 2, ..., n. Thus, for fixed values of all the variates except Xi and Xj, i ] j, the variates (Xi,Xj) are positively dependent if rij \\ 0, and are negatively dependent if rij [ 0. Denote by ki(xi |x1,...,xi−1) the conditional density of Xi given X1, ..., Xi−1, and by k1(x1 |x0)=f1(x1) the marginal density of X1. Then the joint density of x can be written as h(x1,...,xn)=D n i=1 ki(xi |x1, ..., xi−1). (3.9) Suppose that z ’ ECn(0, R,g) and its i-dimensional marginal density is gi(z1,...,zi). Set fi(z1,...,zi)=gi(z1,...,zi) ; D i j=1 qg(zj). We then have ki(xi |x1,...,xi−1)=fi(Q −1 g (F1(x1)), ..., Q −1 g (Fi(xi))) fi(xi). (3.10) Since the i-dimensional marginals are also elliptically contoured distribu- tions, fi(Q −1 g (F1(x1)), ..., Q −1 g (Fi(xi))) is a density weighting function for i-dimensional meta-elliptical distributions. 4. APPLICATIONS Being an extension of elliptical distributions, meta-elliptical distributions can widely be applied in various fields. In particular, many new classes of multivariate distributions can be constructed. In this section, we propose one as an indicative example. A Monte Carlo generator of meta-elliptical distributions is also suggested in this section. META-ELLIPTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS 11 4.1. Various Alternative Hypotheses For a given set of marginal distributions, we can construct various meta- elliptical distributions. In particular, some new classes of distributions can be obtained by changing the marginal parameters of elliptical distributions. Since parameters in marginal distributions govern the behavior of the tail probabilities of marginal distributions, the tail probabilities in different directions for the new distribution may be different. In Example 4.1 below, a multivariate asymmetric t-distribution demonstrates this property. The new distributions can be utilized to provide various alternative hypotheses for testing elliptical distributions. Example 4.1. Multivariate asymmetric t-distributions. Let qm(x) and Qm(x) be the density and distribution functions of the t-distribution FIG. 2. Contour graphics of density functions of bivariate asymmetric t-distributions. (a) AMt(2; 10, 10; 0). (b) AMt(2; 10, 2; 0). (c) AMt(2; 10, 10; 0.5). (d) AMt(2; 10, 10; 0.9). 12 FANG, FANG, AND KOTZ with m degrees of freedom, respectively. Let x=(X1,X2,...,Xn)Œ be an n-dimensional random vector. If x has the joint density f(x1,...,xn)=f(Q −1 m (Qm1 (x1)), ..., Q −1 m (Qm1 (xn)); R)· D n i=1 qmi (xi), (4.1) where f(y1,...,yn) = C ((m+n)/2)[C (m/2)] n−1 [C ((m+1)/2)] n |R| −1/2 1 1+ yŒR −1y m 2 − m+n 2 D n i=1 1 1+ y 2 i m 2 m+1 2 , y=(y1, ..., yn)Œ and R is given by (1.3), we then call x to have an n-dimensional asymmetric t-distribution with (m; m1,m2, ..., mn) degrees of freedom, and use the notation x ’ AMtn(m; m1,m2, ..., mn; 0, R). It is of interest to note that AMtn(m; m1,m2,...,mn; 0, R) and Mtn(m; 0, R) possess the same copulas. The marginals of x have t-distributions with different degrees of freedom. When m=mi, i=1, 2, ..., n, x has an n-dimensional t-distribution with m degrees of freedom (see, e.g., Fang et al. (1990)). Figure 2 shows the densities of asymmetric t-distributions with different marginal degrees of freedom and correlation coefficients. Example 4.2. Multimodal distributions. Some multimodal meta-ellip- tical distributions can be constructed using the methodology proposed. As an example, consider the meta-elliptical distribution (X, Y) with its copula density given in Example 2.2 for N=m=2. (i) Let X be distributed according to a mixture of Weibull distribu- tions with the density given by f(x)= 3 2 x 2 exp {−x 3}I{x > 0}+ 5 2 (x−1) 4 exp { − (x − 1) 5}I{x > 1}, and Y be distributed according to the symmetric Beta distribution Beta(2, 2). Then (X, Y) has a bimodal meta-elliptical distribution. (ii) Let X be as in (i) and Y be distributed according to a mixture of Beta distributions with density given by g(y)=3y(1 − y) I{0<y<1}+3(y − 1)(2 − y) I{1 < y < 2}. Then, (X, Y) has a four-modal meta-elliptical distribution. Figure 3 exhibits these distributions with r=0.1. For absolutely contin- uous variables, this seems to be the most natural example of a multimodal bivariate distribution available in the literature. META-ELLIPTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS 13 FIG. 3.

Monte Carlo Simulation Johnson (1987) provided a comprehensive discussion of generation of elliptical distributions while Fang and Wang (1994) developed the number theoretical approach to this problem. The following algorithm is based on the approach of Fang and Wang. Let it be required to generate a meta-elliptical distribution MEn(0, R,g; F1,...,Fn). Let FR(r) be the associated distribution of R with the desity generator g in the ECn(0, R,g). Fang and Wang’s algorithm (1994) adapted to our situation involves the following steps: (i) Generate u=(u1,...,un) from the uniform distribution on n-dimensional unit sphere by the algorithm given in Section 4.3 of Fang and Wang (1994) (or any other algorithm); (ii) Generate R ’ FR(r); (iii) Let wi=Rui, i=1, ..., n, then (w1,...,wn)Œ ’ ECn(0, R,g); (iv) Find xi=F −1 i (Qg(wi)), i=1, ..., n. We then deliver (x1,x2,...,xn) as a sample from the distribution MEn(0, R,g;F1,...,Fn). REFERENCES 1. R. E. Barlow and F.
