E3 thanks the staff of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council for providing data and technical review 6 Relationship to Prior E3 Work In 2017-2018, E3 completed a series of studies for PGP and Climate Solutions to evaluate the costs of alternative electricity decarbonization strategies in Washington and Oregon • The studies found that the least-cost way to reduce carbon is to replace coal with a mix of conservation, renewables and gas generation • Firm capacity was assumed to be needed for long-run reliability, however the study did not look at that question in depth 2017 E3-PGP Low Carbon Study https://www.ethree.com/projects/study-policies-decarbonize-electric-sector- northwest-public-generating-pool-2017-present/ This study builds on the previous analysis by focusing on long-run reliability • How much capacity is needed to serve peak load under a range of conditions in the NW? • How much capacity can be provided by wind, solar, storage and demand response? • What combination of resources would be needed for reliability under low or zero carbon? The conclusions from this study broadly align with the previous results 7 Long-run Reliability and Resource Adequacy This study focuses on long-run (planning) reliability, a.k.a. Resource Adequacy (RA) • A system is “Resource Adequate” if it has sufficient capacity to serve load across a broad range of weather conditions, subject to a long-run standard for frequency of reliability events, for example 1-day-in-10 yrs. There is no mandatory or voluntary national standard for RA • Each Balancing Authority establishes its own standard subject to oversight by state commissions or locally-elected boards • North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and Western Electric Coordinating Council (WECC) publish information about Resource Adequacy but have no formal governing role Study uses a 1-in-10 standard of no more than 24 hours of lost load in 10 years, or no more than 2.4 hours/year • This is the most common standard used across the industry 8 Study Region – The Greater NW The study region consists of the U.S. portion of the Northwest Power Pool (excluding Nevada) It is assumed that any resource in any area can serve any need throughout the Greater NW region • Study assumes no transmission constraints or transactional friction • Study assumes full benefits from regional load and resource diversity • The system as modeled is more efficient and seamless than the actual Greater NW system Balancing Authority Areas include: Avista, Bonneville Power Administration, Chelan County PUD, Douglas County PUD, Grant County PUD, Idaho Power, NorthWestern Energy, PacifiCorp (East & West), Portland General Electric, Puget Sound Energy, Seattle City Light, Tacoma Power, Western Area Power Administration 9 Individual utility impacts will differ from the regional impacts Cost impacts in this study are presented from a societal perspective and represent an aggregation of all costs and benefits within the Greater NW region • Societal costs include all investment (i.e. “steel-in-the-ground”) and operational costs (i.e. fuel and O&M) that are incurred in the region Cost of decarbonization may be higher or lower for individual utilities as compared to the region as a whole • Utilities with a relatively higher composition of fossil resources today are likely to bear a higher cost than utilities with a higher composition of fossil-free resources Resource Adequacy needs will be different for each utility • Individual systems will need a higher reserve margin than the Greater NW region due to smaller size and less diversity • Capacity contribution of renewables will be different for individual utilities due to differences in the timing of peak loads and renewable generation production METHODOLOGY & KEY INPUTS 11 This study utilizes E3’s Renewable Energy Capacity Planning (RECAP) Model Resource adequacy is a critical concern under high renewable and decarbonized systems • Renewable energy availability depends on the weather • Storage and Demand Response availability depends on many factors RECAP evaluates adequacy through time- sequential simulations over thousands of years of plausible load, renewable, hydro, and stochastic forced outage conditions • Captures thermal resource and transmission forced outages • Captures variable availability of renewables & correlations to load • Tracks hydro and storage state of charge 72° Storage Hydro DR RECAP calculates reliability metrics for high renewable systems: • LOLP: Loss of Load Probability • LOLE: Loss of Load Expectation • EUE: Expected Unserved Energy • ELCC: Effective Load-Carrying Capability for hydro, wind, solar, storage and DR • PRM: Planning Reserve Margin needed to meet specified LOLE Information about E3’s RECAP model can be found here: https://www.ethree.com/tools/recap-renewable-energy-capacity-planning-model/ 12 RECAP Methodology and Data Sources RECAP calculates long-run resource availability through Monte Carlo simulation of electricity system resource availability using weather conditions from 1948-2017 • Each simulation begins on January 1, 1948 and runs hourly through December 31, 2017 • Hourly electric loads for 1948-2017 are synthesized using statistical analysis of actual load shapes and weather conditions for 2014-2017 • Hourly wind and solar generation profiles are drawn from simulations created by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and paired with historical weather days through an E3-created day-matching algorithm • Annual hydro generation values are drawn randomly from 1929-2008 water years and shaped to calendar months and weeks based on the Northwest Power and Conservation Council’s GENESYS model • Nameplate capacity and forced outage rates (FOR) for thermal generation are drawn from various sources including the GENESYS database and the Western Electric Coordinating Council’s Anchor Data Set RECAP calculates whether there are sufficient resources available to serve load during each hour over thousands of simulations 13 RECAP evaluates the availability of energy supplies to meet loads using an 8-step calculation process Calculate Hourly Load Calculate Renewable Profiles Calculate Available Dispatchable Generation Hydro Dispatch Dispatch Storage Dispatch Demand Response Calculate Available Transmission Calculate Loss of Load Step 1 Step 3 Step 5 Step 7 Step 2 Step 4 Step 6 Step 8 14 RECAP calculates a number of metrics that are useful for resource planning Annual Loss of Load Probability (aLOLP) (%): is the probability of a shortfall (load plus reserves exceed generation) in a given year Annual Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) (hrs/yr): is total number of hours in a year wherein load plus reserves exceeds generation Annual Expected Unserved Energy (EUE) (MWh/yr): is the expected unserved load plus reserves in MWh per year Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) (%): is the additional load met by an incremental generator while maintaining the same level of system reliability (used for dispatch-limited resources such as wind, solar, storage and demand response) Planning Reserve Margin (PRM) (%): is the resource margin above 1-in- 2-year peak load, in %, that is required in order to maintain acceptable resource adequacy 15 Additional metric definitions used for scenario development GHG Reduction % is the reduction below 1990 emission levels for the study region • The study region emitted 60 million metric electricity sector emissions in 1990 CPS % is the total quantity of GHG-free generation divided by retail electricity sales • “Clean Portfolio Standard” includes renewable energy plus hydro and nuclear • Common policy target metric, including California’s SB 100 GHG-Free Generation % is the total quantity of GHG-free generation, minus exported GHG-free generation, divided by total wholesale load • Assumed export capability up to 6,000 MW Renewable Curtailment % is the total quantity of wind/solar generation that is not delivered or exported divided by total wind/solar generation RECAP vs. RESOLVE: How are the models different? RESOLVE is an economic model that selects optimal resource portfolios that minimize costs over time • Selects optimal portfolio of renewable, conventional and energy storage resources • Reliability is addressed through high-level assumptions about long- run reliability needs via a PRM constraint • Independent simulations of 40 carefully selected and weighted operating days RECAP is a reliability model that calculates how much effective capacity is needed to meet peak loads • Calculates system-wide Planning Reserve Margin and other long-run reliability statistics • Economics are addressed through high-level assumptions about resource cost and availability • Time-sequential simulations of thousands of operating years selected randomly RECAP Electricity Resource Adequacy RESOLVE Electricity Capacity Expansion E3 often uses RESOLVE and RECAP in tandem to develop portfolios that are least-cost with robust long-run reliability 17 Demand forecast is consistent with PGP study Demand forecast is benchmarked against multiple long-term projections • Both Pre- and Post-EE Load profiles are held constant throughout the analysis period • No assumptions about changing load shapes due to climate change Electrification is only included to the extent that it is reflected in these load growth forecasts • Load growth includes impact of 1.1 million electric vehicles by 2030 • Heavy electrification of buildings, vehicles, or industry would increase RA requirements beyond what this study shows Source Pre EE Post EE PNUCC Load Fcst 1.7% 0.9% BPA White Book 1.1% — NWPCC 7th Plan 0.9% 0.0% TEPPC 2026 CC — 1.3% E3 Assumption 1.3% 0.7% 2018 2030 2050 Peak Load(GW) 43 47 54 Annual Load (TWh/yr) 247 269 309 18 The study considers Resource Adequacy needs under multiple scenarios representing alternative resource mixes 2050 Scenarios Carbon Reduction % Below 19901 GHG-Free Generation %2 CPS %3 Carbon Emissions (MMT) Reference Case 16% 60% 63% 50 60% GHG Reduction 60% 80% 86% 25 80% GHG Reduction 80% 90% 100% 12 90% GHG Reduction 90% 95% 108% 6 98% GHG Reduction 98% 99% 117% 1 100% GHG Reduction 100% 100% 123% 0 2018-2030 Scenarios Carbon Reduction % Below 19901 GHG-Free Generation %2 CPS %3 Carbon Emissions (MMT) 2018 Case4 -6% 71% 75% 63 2030 Reference Case4 -12% 61% 65% 67 2030 Coal Retirement 30% 61% 65% 42 1Greater NW Region 1990 electricity sector emissions = 60 MMT/yr 2GHG-Free Generation % = renewable/hydro/nuclear generation, minus exports, divided by total wholesale load 3CPS % = renewable/hydro/nuclear generation divided by retail electricity sales 42018 and 2030 cases assumes coal capacity factor of 60% 19 New wind and solar resources are added across a geographically diverse footprint The study considers additions nearly 100 GW of wind and 50 GW of solar across the six-state region The portfolios studied are significantly more diverse than the renewable resources currently operating in the region • Each dot in the map represents a location where wind and solar is added in the study • NW wind is more diverse than existing Columbia Gorge wind New renewable portfolios are within the bounds of current technical potential estimates, but are nearly an order of magnitude higher than other studies have examined The cost of new transmission is assumed for delivery of remote wind and solar generation but siting and construction is not studied in detail State Wind WA 18 OR 27 CA 34 ID 18 MT 944 WY 552 UT 13 Total 1588https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/51946.pdf NREL Technical Potential (GW) NW Wind MT Wind WY Wind Solar Additional transmission cost ($50/kW-yr) associated with MT and WY wind 20 Resource Cost Assumptions Note: RECAP is primarily a loss-of-load probability model that calculates resource availability over thousands of simulated years.

most storage today has 1 to 10 hr duration Because storage does not have the required duration, a 100% zero carbon system must build twice as much renewable energy as is required on an annual basis to ensure low production periods have sufficient energy 67 Demand response is limited in its ability to provide firm generation Demand response is capable of providing capacity for limited periods of time, making it difficult to substitute for firm generation when energy is needed for prolonged periods of time DR assumption: 10 calls per year, 4 hours per call Results shown for the 2050 system DR Marginal ELCC % DR Cumulative ELCC MW 72° RELIABILITY PLANNING PRACTICES IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST 69 Reliability Standards This study uses a reliability standard of 2.4 hrs/yr LOLE • Corresponds to 1-day-in-10 year loss of load The Northwest Power and Conservation Council uses a reliability standard of 5% loss of load probability (LOLP) per year • Currently considering moving from an LOLP to LOLE standard At high penetrations of renewable energy, loss of load events become larger in magnitude, suggesting simply measuring the hrs/yr (LOLE) of lost load may be insufficient MWh/yr of expected unserved energy (EUE) is a less common reliability metric in the industry but captures the magnitude of outages Exploring an EUE (MWh/yr) based reliability standard may help to more accurately characterize the reliability of a system that relies heavily on energy-limited resources (e.g. hydro, wind, solar) 70 Regional Planning Reserve sharing system may be beneficial Current planning practices in the NW do not have a centralized capacity counting mechanism Many LSE’s rely on front-office transactions that risk double-counting available surplus generation capacity This analysis shows that new firm capacity is needed in the NW in the near term and significant new firm resources are needed in the long- term depending on coal retirements The region may benefit from and should investigate a formal mechanism for sharing planning reserves to ensure resource adequacy that would both 1) standardize the attribution of capacity value across entities and 2) realize benefits of load & resource diversity among LSE’s in region KEY FINDINGS 72 Key Findings (1 of 2) 1. It is possible to maintain Resource Adequacy for a deeply decarbonized Northwest electricity grid, as long as sufficient firm capacity is available during periods of low wind, solar and hydro production o Natural gas generation is the most economic source of firm capacity, and adding new gas capacity is not inconsistent with deep reductions in carbon emissions o Wind, solar, demand response and short-duration energy storage can contribute but have important limitations in their ability to meet Northwest Resource Adequacy needs o Other potential low-carbon firm capacity solutions include (1) new nuclear generation, (2) gas or coal generation with carbon capture and sequestration, (3) ultra-long duration electricity storage, and (4) replacing conventional natural gas with carbon-neutral gas 2. It would be extremely costly and impractical to replace all carbon-emitting firm generation capacity with solar, wind and storage, due to the very large quantities of these resources that would be required 3. The Northwest is anticipated to need new capacity in the near-term in order to maintain an acceptable level of Resource Adequacy after planned coal retirements 73 Key Findings (2 of 2) 4. Current planning practices risk underinvestment in new capacity required to ensure Resource Adequacy at acceptable levels o Reliance on “market purchases” or “front office transactions” reduces the cost of meeting Resource Adequacy needs on a regional basis by taking advantage of load and resource diversity among utilities in the region o However, because the region lacks a formal mechanism for counting physical firm capacity, there is a risk that reliance on market transactions may result in double- counting of available surplus generation capacity o Capacity resources are not firm without a firm fuel supply; investment in fuel delivery infrastructure may be required to ensure Resource Adequacy even under a deep decarbonization trajectory o The region might benefit from and should investigate a formal mechanism for sharing of planning reserves on a regional basis, which may help ensure sufficient physical firm capacity and reduce the quantity of capacity required to maintain Resource Adequacy The results/findings in this analysis represent the Greater NW region in aggregate, but results may differ for individual utilities APPENDIXROLE OF HYDRO IN MEETING RESOURCE ADEQUACY

Eliminate all days in historical renewable production data not within +/- 15 calendar days of day trying to predict • Load • High load days tend to have high solar output and can have mixed wind output • Calculate difference between load in day trying to predict and historical load in the renewable production data sample • Previous day’s renewable generation • Captures effect of a multi-day heatwave or multi-day rainstorm • Calculate difference between previous day’s renewable generation and previous day’s renewable generation in renewable production data sample Predicting Renewable

proportionally to net load subject to Pmin and Pmax constraints Net Load after Hydro Hydro Dispatch 106 Available Generation For all dispatchable generation, the model uses the net dependable capacity of the generator Using the forced outage rate of each generator, random outages are introduced to create a stochastic set of available generators Outage distribution functions are used to simulate full and partial outages Mean time to repair functionalizes whether there are more smaller duration outages or fewer longer duration outages This is done independently for each generator and then

available generation, storage always discharges if state of charge is greater than zero When net load is less than zero storage always charges When net load is greater than zero, storage charges from
