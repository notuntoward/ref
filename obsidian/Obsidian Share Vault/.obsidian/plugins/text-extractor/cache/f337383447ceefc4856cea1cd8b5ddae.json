Clima- tological forecasts of meteorological variables are used for long-term planning, capturing changing frequencies of extreme events, such as cold and hot periods, and identify- ing suitable locations for deploying new resources. Plan- ning for fuel delivery and maintenance relies on subsea- sonal to seasonal forecasts. On shorter timescales of days, the weather affects both energy demand and supply. Elec- trical load depends critically on weather because electricity is used for heating and cooling. As more renewable energy is deployed, it becomes increasingly important to under- stand how these energy sources vary with atmospheric con- ditions; thus, predictions are necessary for planning unit commitments. On the scales of minutes to hours, short- term nowcasts aid in the real-time grid integration of these variable energy resources (VERs). Meteorologists use the dynamical equations of fl uid motion to forecast the weather by numerically integrat- ing those equations forward in time in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The weather is both variable and uncertain. Because the equations are nonlinear, they are inherently chaotic. Thus, slight changes in initial or boundary conditions, or changes to the representation of physical processes, can lead to large changes in the fore- casts. Meteorologists have learned to deal with the result- ing uncertainty by providing probabilistic forecasts. Varying degrees of uncertainty also exist in almost all other parts of the electric system’s operation, includ- ing the load forecast, the dynamic capacity of transmis- sion lines, and unscheduled outages of nonvariable gen- erators and transmission resources. Some of these are The Use of Probabilistic Forecasts Applying Them in Theory and Practice Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/MPE.2019.2932639 Date of current version: 18 October 2019 november/december 2019 ieee power & energy magazine 47 By Sue Ellen Haupt, Mayte Garcia Casado, Michael Davidson, Jan Dobschinski, Pengwei Du, Matthias Lange, Timothy Miller, Corinna Möhrlen, Amber Motley, Rui Pestana, and John Zack©ISTOCKPHOTO.COM/IG0RZH weather dependent, while others are associated with different uncertainty factors. Therefore, the entire system has uncertainties that are most effectively managed with a probabilistic approach. Because both the atmosphere and the electrical system with significant VERs contain large uncertainties, a probabilistic approach to forecasting and planning becomes necessary to opti- mize the weather-dependent systems. Using probabilistic information provides knowledge that can be used to enhance situational awareness, assess multiple potential grid scenarios, optimize economic outcomes, leverage smart statistics, and improve plans. Probabilistic forecasts should not be considered the only means to solve the problem of predictability of VER output but, rather, as a way forward to better deal with the many specific tasks in power sys- tem operations. These forecasts provide the possibility of making decisions based on a best guess and preparing for the less likely (lower probability) scenarios or extremes that may cause security issues on the grid, such as exces- sive costs for balancing services or equipment malfunc- tions or failures. We will describe some of the leading ways that probabilistic forecasts are being used and show how they might additionally be leveraged to enhance power system operation and planning. Building Probabilistic Forecasts Four primary methodologies are currently used to gener- ate probabilistic forecasts for the power industry: ✔ type 1: statistical methods of probabilistic forecasts ✔ type 2: statistically based scenarios ✔ type 3: physically based ensemble forecasts ✔ type 4: perturbation-based ensemble forecasts. These methodologies differ in their output and usage possibilities, complexity, and computational resource requirements. Figure 1 summarizes these approaches and their typical output types. The first two methodologies statistically generate a probability density function (pdf) from a deterministic NWP simulation and the last two by employing differ- ent NWP models or model parameterization schemes or perturbing the initial or boundary conditions. The dis- advantage of running multiple ensemble members is the high computational cost in comparison to statistically based methodologies. However, the user of such forecasts should be aware that each approach conveys a different type of information about the forecast uncertainty. The statistical postprocess- ing of a single NWP forecast represents the composite historical uncertainty (i.e., based on the statistical sample), whereas an NWP ensemble more explicitly characterizes 48 ieee power & energy magazine november/december 2019 the uncertainty of the current sce- nario. Figure 2 compares the differ- ence in the uncertainty information as seen in the uncertainty bands for wind power forecasts for all German wind plants derived from a statistical type 1 approach using a single NWP model and a multi- model (type 3) approach. While the multimodel spread indicated a high risk of ramping up around noon, the single-model quantiles indi- cated a moderate potential error because the statistical methods constructed a constant climatol- ogy band around a single forecast. Extremes and outliers in present weather situations are not well mod- eled by these methods.

An overview of the four state-of-the-art forecast methodologies to generate probabilistic forecasts. november/december 2019 ieee power & energy magazine 49 the former contain more information. There are three funda- mental attributes that describe the performance of probabi- listic forecasts: 1) reliability, 2) sharpness, and 3) resolution. The reliability of a probabilistic forecast is the degree to which the frequency of the actual outcome matches the forecasted probability. For example, do events with a 60% probability occur in 60% of the cases? If the reliability is not high, the forecast presents a distorted view of the uncer- tainty and requires calibration. The sharpness attribute measures the spread of a pdf. The sharpest probability forecast is one in which one value of a forecast variable has a probability of 100%, and all other values have a probability of 0%, which is essentially a deter- ministic forecast. A sharper forecast (i.e., closer to a deter- ministic forecast) is desirable but only if reliability is high. If a set of forecasted pdfs typically displays less spread than the climatological frequencies, then the forecast is often consid- ered to have meaningful sharpness. The resolution attribute refers to the ability to distinguish among cases with different pdfs. A forecast method that pro- duces the same probability distribution for all cases (e.g., every forecast cycle) shows zero resolution. An example of a zero-resolution forecast is the climatological frequency dis- tribution, which does not distinguish among forecast cases. However, such a forecast may be highly reliable (as in the case of a climatological distribution). A probabilistic forecast with high resolution enables the user to more effectively dis- tinguish cases with low forecast uncertainty from those with high uncertainty, which may be the most valuable aspect of probabilistic forecasts for many applications. There are metrics to measure each of these attributes, with reliability measured most often. Although a high degree of reliability is necessary for a probabilistic forecast to have value, it is seldom sufficient. In practice, the sharpness and resolution distinguish among alternative probabilistic fore- cast solutions. Forecast providers often use composite scores that are implicitly sensitive to all three attributes. How End Users Use Probabilistic Forecasts Nearly all grid system operators with high shares of VERs use weather-dependent generation forecasts. Typically, they use only a best, single (i.e., deterministic) forecast. The use of probabilistic forecasts by grid operators with heavy renew- able penetrations is growing, leading to enhanced grid man- agement decision making. Such forecasting is also providing market uncertainty products to enable automatic commitment of resources to assist with renewable uncertainty. The follow- ing sections provide examples of the current use of forecast uncertainty information in grid management processes. Using Probabilistic Information as Input for Grid Security Calculations: A German Example Several German transmission system operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs) have recognized the importance of including VER predictions in load flow cal- culations to detect future grid congestion and identify coun- termeasures. In the German power system, most renewable generators are connected at the 110-kV or lower voltage level. This leads to an interest in the power flow through substations that connect different grid levels, referred to as vertical grid load. The exchange of data between grid operators, especially between TSOs and DSOs, is tradi- tionally tedious. Several recent initiatives to exchange data regarding grid topology, VER units connected to specific grid points, and actual output promise to optimize grid- related forecasts. Vendors in Germany now provide fore- casts of the vertical grid load to grid operators for a number of substations. Recent experience indicates that integrating generation, load, and price forecasts leads to more accu- rate projections of the vertical grid load. In addition, confi- dence bands show the uncertainty of the vertical grid load forecast, as illustrated in Figure 3. German grid operators currently calculate congestion forecasts for a specific voltage level based on determinis- tic generation and load predictions. The resultant load flow forecasts and grid security measures do not incorporate any uncertainty information about volatile wind and photo- voltaic (PV) generation. German TSOs plan to use probabi- listic forecasts, i.e., scenario forecasts, as an input for grid congestion security calculations (e.g., congestion forecasts) to consider uncertainty in grid management processes. Several methods are used for calculating forecast scenarios of the power production of spatially distributed wind plants and PV stations based on probabilistic forecasts. Using meth- ods such as ensemble copula-coupling approaches (method 2 in Figure 1), one can calibrate the scenario in time and space 10 5 0 –5 –10Power (MW) 21 Mar. 2019 22 Mar. 2019 23 Mar. 2019 Vertical Grid Load Forecast Vertical Grid Load Forecast Spread figure 3.

Negative values refer to transport to the lower-voltage grid; positive values represent transport to the higher-voltage grid. 50 ieee power & energy magazine november/december 2019 to obtain reliable wind and PV forecast scenarios with realis- tic weather-driven correlations among locations. Figure 4 is an example of a vertical grid load measurement and proba- bilistic and deterministic forecasts of the wind power share at this transformer. Using a calibrated scenario forecast instead of a single best forecast for all points of common coupling (PCCs) implies that the load flow calculation must be repeated for each scenario member. Besides the multiple load flow calculations, grid operators must interpret the characteris- tics of the resultant load flow for each grid state scenario. These scenarios can be used to optimize redispatch and VER curtailment actions based on risk according to the probability of predefined critical grid states. Scenario fore- casts can also be used to calculate system services that a DSO could provide to a TSO at a single PCC. Figure  5 plots results from simulations using historical data from a German DSO, for a use case concerning reactive power demand by the TSO. The system required that no reac- tive power exchange take place at this PCC. In Figure 5, the red triangles show the original expected interchange of reactive power flow at the PCC and the green triangles the flow after optimization of the operation of the installed VER (none needed). The green regions represent the pos- sible reactive power flexibility of the VER at each time step. The pink and yellow areas display a simulated forecast of reactive power at the beginning of the time series (6:00 a.m.) and its uncertainty, respectively. In this case, the optimiza- tion did a good job of satisfying the criteria of meeting zero reactive power exchange at the PCC. Using Probabilistic Information to Fine-Tune Unit Commitment: A Lesson From the U.S. Southwest Power Pool The U.S. Southwest Power Pool (SPP) has incorporated more than 17 GW of wind resources into its generation fleet over the past decade. As of early 2019, SPP had a total wind capability of 21.5 GW. To date, SPP has seen upwards of 16.4 GW of instantaneous wind generation and served an instantaneous 63.4% of system load with wind energy. These high levels of variable energy production make accurate and up-to-date resource forecasting critical for system reliability. As industry experts and vendors work to improve forecasts for end-user consumption, SPP is also taking steps to man- age real-time, day-ahead, and multiday forecast errors to better understand the potential impacts of forecast uncer- tainty. Thus, probabilistic forecasting is likely to provide value for these time frames. SPP has developed a process to maintain situational aware- ness of the impacts of potential forecast errors. Each day, the staff runs real-time studies that assume various forecast errors. These multiday reliability studies help the organiza- tion ensure that, in the event that forecast errors occur, it will still have sufficient energy capacity available to serve load. Currently, SPP runs four daily studies with different levels of error and resource flexibility: two with an 85th-percentile forecast errors for both load and variable resource applied and another two with 99th-percentile errors. An advance notice interval of either 6 or 20 h differentiates the two stud- ies at each error percentile. This advance notice interval des- ignates how far in advance of a particular target interval a resource can be called on to be available for that interval. 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 –20 –40 –60Q at GCP (MVar) 68 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 Time (h) Q GCP = 0 Q GCP Normal Q-Range OPF Q-Range Forecast Uncertainty Q-Range figure 5.

The blue and green curves show, respectively, deterministic and scenario-based forecasts of the wind-power share at this transformer. november/december 2019 ieee power & energy magazine 51 This is particularly important because many resources have lengthy lead times and must be started well in advance to ensure that they are online and available to serve load. The staff uses the results of these multiday reliability studies to determine whether additional generation needs to be started ahead of time to mitigate real-time forecast errors. Currently, SPP takes into account up to 10 unique NWP weather models and examines their potential spread to quan- tify the forecast’s uncertainty level. If ensemble members are strongly clustered (i.e., spread is low), SPP treats the sce- narios with higher certainty. But if the ensemble spread is several gigawatts, commensurate with lower overall capac- ity, SPP runs studies to account for higher forecast errors to ensure reliability across the system. In cases where SPP com- mits additional units to mitigate the risk of forecast errors that do not materialize, the cost of system reliability due to incorrect interpretation of the forecast is equal to the make- whole payments of the generators committed. In addition to multiday reliability studies, SPP assesses probable forecast errors in the wind forecast during 1-, 4-, and 8-h horizons across multiple days. For this uncertainty assessment, SPP applies probable errors and then evaluates available capacity during each horizon for sufficiency. The probable error is determined by correlating the forecasted weather with past 95th-percentile wind forecast errors. In cases where errors exceed avail- able capacity for a particular hori- zon, actions may be taken to secure capacity beyond that horizon to ensure reliable system operations. An internal uncertainty response team evaluates weather and other system conditions to identify high- risk time frames during which SPP may face greater uncertainty in load and VER forecasts. The resulting heightened awareness of forecast uncertainty impacts has helped SPP maintain reliable oper- ations during forecast excursions. The group continues to work with forecast vendors to gain better visi- bility of high-uncertainty intervals. Other operators are applying similar analyses or considering whether to do so. For instance, the Portuguese TSO values the proba- bilistic forecast’s ability to quan- tify the added reserves needed due to errors in forecasting renewable VER generation (wind, solar, and hydro). The probabilistic informa- tion provides the confidence inter- val that the operator needs to man- age the system. Capturing Extreme Conditions: A Lesson From the Electric Reliability Council of Texas While renewable energy forecasting has advanced, it remains challenging to accurately predict the output from VERs. Fig- ure 6 is a histogram of system-wide wind generation forecast errors in 2018 at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Although the forecast errors are concentrated near zero, large forecast errors still occur. Probabilistic wind fore- casting becomes particularly valuable for the large variations in wind generation that drive these large forecast errors. When these low-probability events are predicted within the distribu- tion of the probabilistic forecast, their impact on the security and reliability of the grid can be assessed, and a correspond- ing mitigation plan can be developed. Fluctuations from VERs impose a challenge to the bal- ancing services that operators perform to maintain satisfac- tory grid reliability. ERCOT uses a probabilistic forecast that is updated every 15 min to alert system operators of projec- tions for large wind ramp rates during the next 6 h. Figure 7 displays forecasts from ERCOT’s Large Ramp Alert System (ELRAS). ELRAS provides estimates of the probability that wind ramp rates on the 15-min, 60-min, and 180-min time scales will exceed a set of predefined thresholds. An early warning for a large wind ramp event will trigger an in-depth Histogram of Wind Forecast Error in 2018 Day-Ahead Wind Forecast Error (MW) One-Hour-Ahead Wind Forecast Error (MW) 4,500 4,000 3,500 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0<–8,000–7,000 to –8,000–6,000 to –7,000–5,000 to –6,000–4,000 to –5,000–3,000 to –4,000–2,000 to –3,000–1,000 to –2,000–1,000 to 00 to 1,0001,000 to 2,0002,000 to 3,0003,000 to 4,0004,000 to 5,0005,000 to 6,0006,000 to 7,0007,000 to 8,000>8,000 MW Error (HSL-Wind Forecast)Frequency Over Forecast Under Forecast figure 6.

A statistical probabilistic forecast of type 1 provides a range of values, characterized as percentiles or the probability of occurrence, that can help the operators gauge the need for reserves in each forecasted scenario. ERCOT has develop­ ed an online tool to incorporate probabilistic wind forecasts into the real­time decision process, as shown in Figure 8. The probabilistic wind forecast is delivered for 50th, 90th, 95th, and 98th percentiles for the next 6 h. Operators can select one of these wind forecasts in the online tool. For example, the green line represents the load forecast, while the blue line represents the online generation capacity when considering the 50th­percentile wind forecast. The online generation capacity with a 90th­percentile wind forecast is given in red. The reserves [regulation­up (orange) and nonspinning (purple)] are overlaid on the red line, which represents addi­ tional generation capacity to be deployed if needed. In this example, after 18:00, a greater­than­10% chance exists for the forecasted load to be higher than the predicted online gen­ eration capacity. Because reserves are procured, the system maintains sufficient generation capacity to serve the load. Use of Probabilistic Forecasting for Extreme Events, Such as High-Speed Shutdown Risk Assessment: An Irish Case High­speed shutdown (HSSD) events, caused by wind speeds near 25 m/s, occur predominantly in coastal or mountainous areas but seldom cover a large portion of a given jurisdiction.

CDT: Central Daily Time. november/december 2019 ieee power & energy magazine 53 wind energy penetration has reached a level that can meet or exceed the local demand. In such areas, concurrent shut- down of multiple wind plants due to high wind speeds can cause system problems. Ireland is such an area, where practically all wind plants can produce full generation when wind speeds reach approxi- mately 15 m/s and continue until the plants reach their HSSD set point. The power measurements do not indi- cate when such set points are reached in the wind-speed range below the HSSD: i.e., 20–25 m/s. Forecasting and signaling the high wind speed enables a system operator to prepare for large-scale HSSD events. Since a lack of power is more dangerous for power system reliability than surplus, which can always be curtailed, a need for action exists long before a deterministic forecast can pro- vide accurate information. Forecasting the probability of an HSSD event enables the system operator to verify system reliabil- ity and allocate reserves long in advance to keep costs at a mini- mum. At the Irish system operators EirGrid and System Operator for Northern Ireland, an HSSD warn- ing system based on WEPROG’s 75-member Multi-Scheme Ensem- ble Prediction System (MSEPS), a type 3 method (see Figure 1), has been developed for this purpose. The HSSD warning system con- tains three components: ✔ a probability indicator that a fraction of the HSSD will experience cutoff (in coop- eration with the end user, the system-critical part of the capacity is determined, e.g., 30% of the capacity) ✔ an accumulated part of the expected cutoff capacity, which provides the accumulated cutoff probability for the expected temporal shortage of capacity and ramps ✔ a table combining the information above for more de- tailed analysis and action planning. Figure 9 displays the three components of the sys- tem. Figure 9(a) shows the amplitude of the extreme wind speeds that cause a certain percentage of cutoff combined with strong down-ramps. This provides important knowl- edge to help determine 1) the maximum reserve required to maintain system balance, 2) the risk of a shortage that exceeds available up-ramp capacity, and 3) the risk for excess capacity and congestion in the power lines.

However, a temporal accu- mulation of the capacity that is in shutdown risk [Figure 9(b)] was required for the control room staff to be able to consider the total amount and length of reserve required and the asso- ciated down-ramps and up-ramps of previously down-ramped capacity. The table in Figure 9(c) provides details for the con- trol room staff’s concrete planning. Figure 10 shows a real-time example of two concurrent HSSD events in which the forecast system issued warnings when the probability for an HSSD of more than 20% of the capacity exceeded 25%. The y-axis shows the probability for the percentage of capacity that will experience HSSD, and the difference between percentiles P10–P90 provides the probability that the event will occur. Due to the variability of forecasts in such situations, EirGrid decided that a warning would only be issued if these thresholds were exceeded in a minimum of three consecutive forecast cycles. Thus, outliers are captured but not overinterpreted. In both cases, a warn- ing was issued, and in both cases, it was appropriate. One of the many challenges in developing the warning system was that the alert frequency must be carefully config- ured to assure that alerts are taken seriously when they con- tain a realistic security concern for the system. The main considerations were lead time, change of severity level since previous alert, initial day of the week, valid day of the week, time of day, severity of the event computed from a ramp rate, the actions required, and need and ability to call back actions. For the Irish case, the strategy for issuing an alert was found to work best after the following two points had been defined: 1) alerts are issued according to a simple scheme (e.g., probability of an HSSD of 20% of capacity exceeding 25% probability for more than three consecutive forecasts) and 2) the number of alerts is reduced by issuing updates for changes in conditions once an initial alert has been sent, thus preventing critical alerts from being overlooked. This setup allows for the automatic filtering of unpre- dictable weather phenomena and reduces the risk for sys- tem shortages and unwanted volatility. Such probabilistic HSSD forecasts also allow the end user to strategically prepare for the increased risk of such events. With a suit- able presentation and alert system strategy, the danger of HSSD conditions can be determined and respective actions taken in real time. With probabilistic forecasts and measurements in both graphical and tabular formats, confidence in the forecasts increases, and the operators become more likely to take the correct actions without wasting resources.

The physical value of these necessary reserves is determined by variables that have a stochastic behavior. The following items stand out in the Spanish system: ✔ deviation between market schedules and the wind forecast ✔ forecast errors in other variables (demand, solar, co- generation, and so on) ✔ unscheduled outages of the generation units. The large amount of wind generation (currently 23,070 MW) installed in the Spanish peninsular system has a significant impact on system balancing. Short-term (1–2-h) fluctuations in wind energy on primary, secondary, and tertiary reserves remain less important because demand and sudden unsched- uled outages of thermal units more significantly affect such reserves. However, the longer-term (8–12-h) fluctuations have a primary impact on system reserves, especially on spinning reserves. The calculation of these reserves is the main role of probabilistic forecasts at REE. Both probabilistic and deter- ministic methods are used. The probabilistic method assumes uncertainty as an inde- pendent probabilistic variable and calculates the combined probability of loss of reserve as the sum of a convolution of pdfs calculated with the type 1 method (see Figure 1) and the additional reserve. The type 1 probabilistic method takes into account demand forecast errors, wind forecast errors, and unexpected outages of thermal units. The additional reserve allows for possible uncertainties regarding devia- tions between forecast and market schedules and the man- agement of international interconnections. Peak-hour demand forecast errors for different hori- zons are fit to Gaussian distributions [Figure 11(a)], while the wind forecast errors [Figure 11(b)] are fit to Weibull distributions.

Once the prob- abilities for all groups expected to run the next day are calculated, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed that provides the combined pdf [Figure 11(c)]. The sum of the three previous stochastic variables is another stochastic variable that indicates the reserve necessary to cover the demand [Figure 11(d)]. Figure 12 displays the amount of reserve required for each horizon with its margin of confidence. In this way, periodic runs of the probabilistic method determine a secure reserve level. REE also calculates reserve based on a deterministic method, which uses the confidence intervals of the wind forecast (P50 and P85) calculated from meteorological ensembles of type 4 (see Figure 1). In this way, the reserve is computed as the sum of the maximum loss of generation due to simple failure (1,000 MW), demand deviation (2%), wind power deviation (difference between P50 and P85), and additional reserve. The probabilistic method of sizing the reserves allows the system to carry less reserve without affecting the security of the supply, which is the highest pri- ority for REE. Experimental and Future Uses of Probabilistic Forecasts Probabilistic forecasts can be used to enhance power sys- tem stability and forecast future system conditions. As VER penetration increases, reserve capacities decrease while ramping increases. Look-ahead system assessment tools will become more important to maintaining an eco- nomic dispatch structure and unit commitment. For instance, probabilistic forecasts are being designed for application in future California Independent System Opera- tor (CAISO) flexible ramp products (both day ahead and real time). Currently CAISO has deployed probabilistic method type 1 (see Figure 1) for a real-time flexible ramp product. This method leans heavily on a statistical histogram method- ology that examines historic forecast movement between two periods of time and sets a re quirement based on the uncertainty of net load. In the future, CAISO plans to expand this to include forecast information, either as regressors in the quantile regression technique (type 2) or using the ensemble approach (type 3 or 4). CAISO also plans to include a new commitment called day-ahead reliability and deliver- ability assessment (replacing Residual Unit Commitment) that will allow multiple scenario optimization beyond the meteoro- logical information. The Australian Energy Market Operator developed a Bayesian belief network to assess historic forecast perfor- mance and then project forward, dynamically, using forecast conditions. This augments the reserve assessments based on the usual asset contingencies. This approach considers that weather forecast error (wind, solar, and temperature) and contingent weather events show an increasing impact on the network and at times present the largest contingency other than historic rare largest-asset contingencies. Summary Because the power system is sen- sitive to weather information and the atmosphere is inherently vari- able, it is prudent to quantify the uncertainty in weather forecasts and leverage that probabilistic information to the best advantage of system operators. Here, we have listed current methods to pro- vide probabilistic forecasts and discussed how to judge whether the probabilistic forecast is sharp, resolves different distributions, and is statistically reliable.

A graph from the REE system of probabilistic reserves at different time horizons and different confidence intervals. One of the biggest hurdles for implementing probabilistic forecasting in industry is the lack of case studies, as well as reference materials in the form of documentation, standards, and guidelines. november/december 2019 ieee power & energy magazine 57 have described some of the forefront and experimental applications of probabilistic forecasts, including to assess grid security, fine-tune unit commitment, capture extreme conditions, prepare for extreme events more effectively, plan for reserves more efficiently, better maintain system stabil- ity, and design flexible ramping products. One of the biggest hurdles for implementing probabi- listic forecasting in industry is the lack of case studies, as well as reference materials in the form of documentation, standards, and guidelines. IEA Wind Task 36, Wind Energy Forecasting, is an international collaboration that has, as one of its tasks, to facilitate optimal use of forecasting solutions with a special focus on uncertainty/probabilistic forecasting for the power industry. The task concentrates on the use of forecast uncertainties for operation and management of the power system with substantial variable generation, for oper- ation, trading, and balancing in power markets. The goal is to develop best-practice guidelines for the implementation, measurement, and quantification of the value of probabilis- tic forecasts based on experience from experts around the globe. Additional information can be found in the “For Fur- ther Reading” section. Many users say that wind and solar forecasts would have more value in their decision-making processes if they were more accurate. We must recognize, however, that the atmo- sphere contains inherent variability that cannot be precisely predicted. A more realistic approach embraces that uncertainty, quantifies it, and uses that probabilistic information to opti- mize system operation. Probabilistic forecasts show promise for growth as a tool to manage the variability of wind and solar generation in electric systems. Decision-making processes that leverage forecast uncertainty information have almost always been demonstrated to produce consistently better deci- sions than those that don’t use this information. Therefore, a near-term opportunity remains to glean more value from wind and solar forecasts by more effectively using currently avail- able uncertainty information without having to wait for future improvements in weather forecasting technology.
