{"path":"JackPaceMaker/attachments/Jack's proposed PM settings.pdf","text":"~ Jack’s proposed settings for pacemaker January 18, 2022 ~ The following proposed settings follow my reading of the Boston Scientific Reference Guide - 359239-002_multi_RG_en-US_S and review of my experience during my recent 1,600 miles per year of hilly riding and 100,000+ lifetime miles. • I breath fairly slowly 60 breaths/min under hard exertion • My heart rate drops very rapidly when exercise stops, with no ill effects • My favorite riding has immediate hill-climbing demands • I’d like to be able to maintain 140-150 bpm for 10mins-1hour for long hills • I’ve felt good and able to climb when in flutter at 140+ bpm • Rates clamped to 100-ish bpm make me feel fatigued The following programmable parameters control the PM response to the sensor values generated by the accelerometer & MV sensor: • Response Factor (prefer Higher) • Ventilatory Threshold (bend in bilinear slope)(preferred 120 per BostSci manual) • Ventilatory Threshold Response (preferred 70-85%) • Fitness Level )(preferred Endurance Sports – think RAMROD (150 miles with big long climbs) • Reaction Slope: Short (10s or less), so I can blast up a surprise hill or staircase • Recovery Time: 5 mins seems about right, especially with LRL being ~ 67 I’d prefer my Lower Rate Limit to be not 70, since that has been my typical rate when in flutter. I want something different so as not to be confused. How about 67 to meet Dr. Zivin’s recommendation of 60-70 while not being exactly 70. Relationship between MV and rate is approximately bilinear. Be cautious about using “Derive from Patient Attributes” on the programmer for fear that settings will be too low. My APMHR is 155 x80%=124 RightRate Pacing uses minute ventilation to provide Rate Adaptive Pacing. Yes! It’s for folks with chronotropic incompetent who would benefit from increase pacing rates that are concurrent with increased activity level. 6-hour calibration time – when is that? While I was still chilling after implant?
