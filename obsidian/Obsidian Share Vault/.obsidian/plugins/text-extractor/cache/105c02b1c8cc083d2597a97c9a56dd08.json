Because however history remembers Biden (and I think it will be kinder), it’s clear that a solid majority of Americans have determined his presidency to be a decisive failure. In Pennsylvania and Georgia, states Biden narrowly won in 2020, just over 40 percent of voters this week approved of his job performance. Nationally, that number was a tick lower, and roughly consistent with just about every poll over the past two years. More than two-thirds of voters said the economy was in bad shape, but I don’t think that alone tells the story of Biden’s repudiation. The real reason, I think, goes deeper than any one policy or economic indicator. Biden’s term started out promisingly enough. I thought he misread his mandate and pursued a more expansive agenda than a lot of voters endorsed, but however one judged the substance of his presidency, you couldn’t argue with his legislative success. Biden signed into law about $2.5 trillion in short-term aid and longer-term investments in education, energy and infrastructure. His administration bungled the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, but he rallied Europe capably in its defense of Ukraine. Biden performed well enough to stave off his party’s losses in the 2022 midterm elections, which emboldened him to run again. But by then, his approval ratings had already been dropping for months. Consumers were reeling from inflation — the result, at least in part, of massive public spending. Americans were increasingly concerned about migrants streaming across the southern border, too. Underlying all of this, always, was the issue of Biden’s age. He simply didn’t look or sound up to the job. He shuffled rather than strode, slurred his words, kept to scripted material. When Biden gave a perfectly average State of the Union speech earlier this year, managing to depart from the text with a quip here and there, Democrats — and, truth be told, much of the news media — rejoiced as if he’d just won the “kitchen debate” with Nikita Khrushchev. The problem wasn’t merely the president’s age. It was his denial of reality — and his party’s. White House aides portrayed Biden as keeping his young advisers working late into the night, quizzing them for details. They repeated this nonsensical idea that he was the only Democrat alive who could beat Trump, just because he was the only one who had. Democrats denounced anyone who raised the fitness issue as ageist and accused us of abetting Trump. Ultimately, of course, the world saw Biden at his worst in a televised debate, and party insiders were forced to act, too late. But we’ve been through all that already. The point I want to make is that there’s a common thread in all of this. Because when the Biden team faced pressure from voters over inflation and immigration, they answered it the same way they answered anxieties about his age. Never mind what you thought about the price of your groceries; inflation was falling and wages were rising! Never mind the images of desperate migrants streaming across a broken border; crossings were going down! If the Biden administration had a mantra, it would have been: “You’re not really seeing what you think you’re seeing.” Which never actually works. It only infuriates people. Maybe in hindsight — and there’s been an awful lot of that this week — Harris should have tried to put some distance between herself and Biden, although I doubt it would have worked. She found herself in the classic vice president’s conundrum, tasked with casting herself as a pivotal player in the administration while trying not to be saddled with its least popular decisions. No one in history has ever found a great answer for that, and Harris wasn’t likely to be the first. But the lesson Democrats should take away from Biden’s political collapse is that denial isn’t a strategy. You can’t tell voters that the things they see for themselves are mere illusions, invalidated by self-serving anecdotes or self- affirming data. You have to acknowledge hard realities and make the best case you have. And if you can’t think up a case that’s strong enough, or you’re not up to making it effectively, then you should probably yield to someone who can. In the end, as I say, I think Biden will be fondly remembered, in the same way that Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush are admired now for their decency. Biden has always served his country ably and with integrity. I’m not sure we can say the same, though, for the Democratic aides and leaders who thought voters could be made to distrust their own experience. I guess they succeeded in protecting Biden for a while. They sure as hell didn’t protect the rest of us.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
