Introduction Over the last decade, many countries have experienced a dynamic development of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES), among which wind and solar play a central role. From 2005 to 2014, RES generation in the EU (28 countries) increased by 87.8%, from 495.7 GWh to 930.9 GWh. In 2016, it reached 29.6% of the total gross electricity generation. Increasing input of RES affects both the electricity market and the distribution system. On one hand, it results in the reduction of CO2 emissions and the decrease of wholesale electricity prices [1–4]. On the other hand, expanding RES creates new challenges for market participants. Electricity generated by wind or photovoltaic (PV) depends strongly on weather conditions and, hence, is volatile and difﬁcult to forecast; see [5] for a comprehensive discussion. In some countries, such as Germany, RES generation is granted priority during the dispatch and receives a ﬁxed feed-in tariff. As a result, the day-ahead prices are more prone to extreme behavior, such as spikes or negative values [6]. Finally, RES generation increases the risk of system imbalance, because an inelastic demand needs to be covered by a stochastic supply. Nowadays, a major share of electricity is sold on power exchanges, such as Nord Pool or European Energy Exchange (EEX) in Europe, India Energy Exchanges (IEX) in Asia, and Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland Interconnection LLC (PJM) or New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) in the US, where day-ahead contracts dominate. The day-ahead prices, which in Europe are also called ’spot prices’, are set around noon on the day preceding the delivery. In order to allow for Energies 2019, 12, 631; doi:10.3390/en12040631 www.mdpi.com/journal/energies Energies 2019, 12, 631 2 of 15 adoption of trading contracts in the case of unplanned events and changing weather conditions, the day-ahead markets are complemented by intraday and balancing markets. The intraday markets, typically organized by power exchanges, take the form of auctions (e.g., in Spain) or continuous trading (e.g., in Germany). They allow purchasing and selling of electricity throughout the whole day, up to a few minutes before the physical delivery. The ﬁnal balancing of the demand and supply is achieved through the balancing markets, which are controlled by system operators and aim at securing the system stability. However, in some countries, such as Poland, they are used for short term transactions, instead of the intraday markets. The structural changes in electricity markets inﬂuence the decision process of generation utilities. This research focuses on a small RES generator, which has no market power and, hence, is a price taker. This type of a utility typically sells electricity through a larger trading company. The generator needs to decide, in advance, how much electricity will be sold in the spot market. If it offers a quantity smaller than the actual production, then the excess generation is traded in the intraday or the balancing market. On the contrary, if the offered quantity is larger than the actual one, then the RES generator needs to purchase the electricity to meet the day-ahead contracts. The optimal decision of the generator on where to sell the production depends on the relation between prices in these markets [7,8]. Unfortunately, when making the decision, the generator faces the uncertainty about the production and the price levels. Hence, it is not sure if it is able to produce the proposed quantity and which market offers a higher price. This article addresses the second question and investigates the possible gains from utilizing forecasts of the price spread between the day-ahead and the intraday/balancing market in the decision process. There is a rich literature on forecasting electricity prices; see [5] and [9,10] for comprehensive reviews of point and probabilistic forecasts, respectively. However, the majority of articles focus on day-ahead prices, since they have the longest history and are perceived as a benchmark for various ﬁnancial instruments. A variety of prediction methods were proposed, ranging from linear, univariate time series models [11], neural networks [12], and Lasso regressions [13], to multivariate models [14,15] and forecast averaging [16,17]. The literature indicates that RES generation is one of the most important drivers of the spot price level [1,4,18] and distribution [19]. The intraday prices have not been studied as intensively as their day-ahead counterparts. There are a few articles which analyzed the intraday markets in Germany [13,20,21], Spain [12], and the US [4]. They linked the intraday prices with RES forecast errors [18,22,23]. Unfortunately, typically the research focuses only on short-term forecasts and, hence, assumes the knowledge of the day-ahead prices [4]. This article extends the literature in various directions. First, we consider the point of view of a small generator, which needs to choose an optimal trading strategy by comparing predicted prices in different markets. Hence, the day-ahead and the intraday/balancing prices have to be forecasted jointly. We show that the sign of the price spread, which is crucial for the decision process, can be successfully predicted with econometric models. Second, we examine different model speciﬁcations, which vary in terms of the aggregation level (hourly versus daily data), the choice of exogenous variables, the lag structure, and the length of the estimation window. We show that although the disaggregated, hourly data provides more information, it does not lead to more efﬁcient forecasts than the aggregated, daily approach. Moreover, the results indicate that the fundamentals—in particular, RES generation—impact not only the level of prices but also the price spread, and that they are useful in formulating an optimal trading strategy. Finally, we demonstrate that the statistical measures of forecast accuracy, such as the classiﬁcation power, do not necessarily coincide with economic gains. Similar to [13,24], we encourage a deeper look at the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of prediction methods. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data used for modeling the Polish and the German electricity markets. In Section 3, we introduce the econometric methods employed in the analysis and discuss forecast evaluation. We present the results in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude the study.

Although they are both located in Europe and are neighbors, they differ in terms of the generation structure and the market organization. Germany is well known for its success in RES penetration, which—at the time of this article—accounts for 40.2% of total electricity production (see https://www.energy- charts.de). At the same time, Polish electricity generation is based on coal, with RES reaching only 8.4% (see https://www.pse.pl/dane-systemowe/funkcjonowanie-kse/raporty-miesieczne-z- funkcjonowania-rb/raporty-miesieczne). In both countries, RES has priority during the dispatch. Second, the German and Polish markets are designed differently, which could affect the decision process of market participants [8]. The intraday market in Germany is based on the pay-as-bid principle, which has been complemented by intraday auctions. In Poland, the balancing market, which is considered as the main market for contract adjustments, uses a double price approach. The practice shows, however, that a single market-clearing price is preferred by the market operator and, hence, the double prices have never been applied. Finally, in Germany, negative prices are allowed in both day-ahead and intraday markets, whereas, in Poland, until 2019 the balancing prices were restricted to be positive and to stay within an interval of 70–500 PLN/MWh (which is equivalent to 17.5–125 EUR/MWh). A recent regulation, which came into power on 1 January 2019, changed the lower and the upper bounds to −50,000 PLN/MWh and 50,000 PLN/MWh, respectively. The data used in this research is hourly and spans the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017. The data for Poland consists of day-ahead and balancing market prices (both in Polish zloty, PLN). The prices are complemented by exogenous variables: The forecasted energy demand, the forecasted wind generation, and the forecasted available energy reserves. The intraday prices are not included in the analysis, as the market is not liquid. The German data is comprised of energy prices (in Euros) in the day-ahead and intraday markets. The intraday prices are calculated as the weighted average of all intraday contracts for the given hour. The exogenous variables are: The forecasted total load, which can be treated as a proxy for the forecasted demand, and the forecasted wind generation. Data sources and units are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Data sources.

First, it can be observed that the day-ahead prices are less volatile than the intraday/balancing prices, especially for Poland. Moreover, both time series are characterized by positive spikes, with Germany exhibiting sudden drops with prices falling below zero. Spikes are also observed in the spread series, indicating that they are not perfectly synchronized between markets. The basic descriptive statistics of electricity prices are presented in Table 2. They conﬁrm that balancing and intraday prices are, on average, higher and more volatile than day-ahead prices, with the difference being more pronounced for Poland. Finally, it could Energies 2019, 12, 631 4 of 15 be noticed that the spread in Germany has a much lower variance than any of the prices, whereas, in Poland, the spread is more volatile than spot prices.

Forecasting Methods and Forecast Evaluation In order to model market preference, let us deﬁne a decision variable Yht, which equals one when the generator decides to sell the electricity for hour h and day t in the intraday market, and zero otherwise. Let us consider two benchmark strategies: The ﬁrst one assumes that the utility sells all generated electricity in the day-ahead market. In such a case, Yht = 0 for all h and t. The second one assumes that the generator enters only the intraday/balancing market and, hence, it is always the case that Yht = 1. We refer to them as naïve day-ahead and naïve intraday/balancing strategies, respectively. Here, we compare them with a data driven approach, which assumes that the decision depends on the relationship between the day-ahead (P0 ht) and the intraday/balancing price (P1 ht) Yht = {1 if P1 ht > P0 ht, 0 if P1 ht ≤ P0 ht. (1) As the price difference ∆Pht = P1 ht − P0 ht is not known in advance, the generator needs to base its decision on the predicted spread ˆYht = {1 if ∆ ˆPht|t−1 > 0, 0 if ∆ ˆPht|t−1 ≤ 0 , (2) where ∆ ˆPht|t−1 is a forecast of ∆Pht, computed using the information available on day t − 1. In this research, two alternative ways of forecasting Yht are considered. First, autoregressive models with exogenous variables (ARX) are examined, which either (1) separately model the level of prices P0 ht and P1 ht and then compute ∆Pht, or (2) describe directly the price spread, ∆Pht. In the regression, Energies 2019, 12, 631 6 of 15 information on predicted market fundamentals and past levels of prices is used. The forecast, ˆYht, is based on the sign of the predicted spread ∆ ˆPht. Second, probit models are used, which describe directly the distribution of the binomial variable Yht deﬁned by (1). Similar to ARX models, the probability Prob(Yht = 1) is conditioned on exogenous variables and lagged prices. A more detailed description of the models is presented in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. When the aggregated, daily models are considered, then the endogenous and exogenous variables are constructed as the daily averages of the corresponding hourly variables. The decision variable Yt becomes Yt = {1 if P1 t > P0 t 0 if P1 t ≤ P0 t , (3) which implies that the generator adopts the same strategy throughout the day, and hence Y1t = ... = Y24t = Yt. In the remaining part of the article, the following notation is used: • Dt denotes a (4 × 1) vector of deterministic variables: A constant and dummy variables for Mondays, Saturdays, and Sundays/Holidays, • Xht represents a vector of exogenous variables, which is a subset of {X1,ht.X2,ht, X3,ht} for Poland and {X1,ht, X2,ht} for Germany. Variables Xi are deﬁned in Table 1. • Xt, P0 t , and P1 t are daily averages of the corresponding hourly variables: Xht, P0 ht, and P1 ht, respectively. 3.1. Autoregressive Models ARX is a linear model, which links the current level of an endogenous variable with its past values and a vector of exogenous variables. It has been widely applied in the literature and has proved useful in forecasting electricity prices; see [5] for a discussion. Here, two model speciﬁcations are considered. First, the prices P0 ht and P1 ht are modeled separately P0 ht = αDt + βXht + ∑ i∈L∪{1} θiP0 ht−i + ϵht, (4) P1 ht = αDt + βXht + ∑ i∈L θiP1 ht−i + γP0 ht−1 + ϵht. (5) Then, the spread ∆Pht is computed as their difference: ∆Pht = P1 ht − P0 ht. Alternatively, the price spread is modeled directly, according to the following formula ∆Pht = αDt + βXht + ∑ i∈L θi∆Pht−i + γP0 ht−1 + ϵht. (6) In both model speciﬁcations, α and β are vectors of coefﬁcients corresponding to the deterministic and exogenous variables, respectively, while θi are the autoregressive parameters and ϵt are the residuals. Lags i belong to the pre-deﬁned set L. Unfortunately, on day t − 1, not all prices P1 ht−1 are known yet, nor the spreads ∆Pht−1. For this reason the lag i = 1 is excluded from set L, except when modeling P0 ht. In order to compensate for this, the previous day’s price P0 ht−1 is added to Equations (5) and (6). Since the main interest of the generator is the optimal choice of the market, the results of regressions (4)–(6) are used to predict ˆYht. According to Equation (2), the utility sells in the intraday/balancing market, ˆYht = 1, when the predicted spread ∆ ˆPht is positive. Otherwise, it chooses the day-ahead market, ˆYht = 0. For aggregated, daily models, the hourly observations in Equations (4)–(6) are replaced by their daily averages: Xt, P0 t , P1 t , and ∆Pt. The structure of the models remains unchanged. As a result, the decision variable Yt, deﬁned by (3), is equal to one when ∆ ˆPt > 0, and zero otherwise. Energies 2019, 12, 631 7 of 15 Parameters α, β, θi, and γ are estimated with the least-squares (LS) method. For each hour, h, separately, the model is ﬁtted such that the sum-of-squares of the differences between the observed and predicted values is minimized. 3.2. The Probit Model The probit model is used to describe directly the probability distribution of the binary variable Yht. The model is formulated as follows: Prob(Yht = 1|Ωt−1) = Φ ( αDt + βXht + ∑ i∈L θi∆Pht−i + γP0 ht−1 ) , (7) where Φ(x) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function, α is a (1 × 4) vector of parameters describing the impact of deterministic variables, and β summarizes the effect of the exogenous variables. Finally, θi are the autoregressive parameters, with lags i belonging to the pre-deﬁned set L, as in Equations (4)–(6). In order to utilize all the information available on day t − 1, the effect of P0 ht on the probability is added by use of the parameter γ. Parameters α, β, θi, and γ are estimated separately for each hour, h, using the maximum likelihood method. Due to the lack of a closed-form solution for the maximization problem, the parameters are estimated numerically, using the Nelder-Mead algorithm [25]. Calculations are conducted in the R environment. The initial parameters for the procedure are estimated by a least-squares method and the number of iterations is limited to 10, 000. With parameter estimates ˆα, ˆβ, ˆθi, and ˆγ obtained within the rolling calibration window, the forecast of Yht is deﬁned as ˆYht =    1 if Φ ( ˆαDt + ˆβXht + ∑ i∈L ˆθi∆Pht−i + ˆγP0 ht−1 ) > µ, 0 if Φ ( ˆαDt + ˆβXht + ∑ i∈L ˆθi∆Pht−i + ˆγP0 ht−1 ) ≤ µ , (8) where µ ∈ (0, 1) is the threshold parameter. Typically, the threshold is chosen to equal µ = 0.5. However, the results indicated that µ = 0.4 or µ = 0.3 provide more accurate and proﬁtable forecasts (see Section 4 for details). For aggregated, daily models, Formula (7) becomes Prob(Yt = 1|Ωt−1) = Φ ( αDt + βXt + ∑ i∈L θi∆Pt−i + γP0 t−1 ) , (9) with the parameters deﬁned as above. The forecasts ˆYt are obtained, as in (8), by comparing the forecasted probability with the threshold µ. 3.3. Forecast Evaluation The literature proposes various methods, which could be used to evaluate the accuracy of binomial variable forecasts. First, one could compute the classiﬁcation power, denoted here by p: p = 1 HT H ∑ h=1 T ∑ t=1 1{Yht= ˆYht}, (10) where H = 24, T = 365, and 1{s} stands for an indicator variable, which takes value one when s is true, and zero otherwise. This measure shows how often the forecast coincides with the true value. Second, two measures of the predictive power could be computed: Energies 2019, 12, 631 8 of 15 q0 = ∑H h=1 ∑T t=1 1{Yht= ˆYht=0} ∑H h=1 ∑T t=1 1{ ˆYht=0} , and (11) q1 = ∑H h=1 ∑T t=1 1{Yht= ˆYht=1} ∑H h=1 ∑T t=1 1{ ˆYht=1} . (12) The ﬁrst measure describes the probability that Yht = 0 when ˆYht = 0. Similarly, q1 indicates the probability that Yht = 1 when ˆYht = 1. It should be noticed that, for the day-ahead strategy, the classiﬁcation power p = q0 and it is equal to the unconditional probability Prob(Yht = 0). Analogously, for the second naïve strategy, which always selects the intraday/balancing market, we have p = q1 = Prob(Yht = 1). The classical, statistical approach of prediction evaluation provides an interesting description of the forecast performance, but may not reﬂect the main concerns of the generator, which are the proﬁt and the risk. Therefore, the analysis is complemented by two measures related to ﬁnancial outcomes of the adopted strategy. The potential gains and losses induced are computed relative to the benchmark strategy. This implies that the hourly proﬁt, πht, becomes πht = ˆYhtP1 ht + (1 − ˆYht)P0 ht − P0 ht = ˆYht∆P1 ht. (13) Using Equation (13), one could compute the daily proﬁt πt = ∑24 h=1 πht and the total yearly proﬁt π = ∑T t=1 πt. In order to describe the ﬁnancial aspects of the decision, we use the total yearly proﬁt, π and the 5% Value at Risk (VaR) associated with daily proﬁts πt. 4. Results The results for the Polish and German markets are analyzed from the perspective of forecast accuracy (p, q0, and q1) and ﬁnancial proﬁtability (π). The risk associated with each of the forecasting methods is measured with the 5% VaR of daily proﬁts. Various model speciﬁcations are examined, which differ in terms of the aggregation (daily versus hourly data), the choice of the exogenous variables X, the lag structure L, and the length of the calibration window. Finally, the data-driven approach is compared with the second naïve strategy, which assumes selling only in the intraday/balancing market. 4.1. Poland The results for the Polish electricity market are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Table 3 shows the classical measures of prediction accuracy. The results for the top three model speciﬁcations for each forecasting approach are presented and compared with the naive strategies. It should be emphasized that the balancing market provided higher prices than the day-ahead market in 51.2% of cases. First, the aggregated, daily models were considered. The most accurate were the ARX models, which separately described the day-ahead and balancing prices. They correctly predicted the sign of the spread in 57.3% of the cases. The best probit model had a classiﬁcation accuracy of 55.3%. Note that the best ARX model speciﬁcation was more successful in forecasting high spot prices than high balancing prices (q0 = 0.606 > 0.563 = q1). When the disaggregated models were considered, it was observed that there were no substantial differences between model types and model speciﬁcations. The classiﬁcation powers were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the aggregated models, and the highest one reached 53.2%. This still exceeded the naïve, balancing market strategy, but the gains for data driven strategies were much less pronounced. Energies 2019, 12, 631 9 of 15 Table 3.

The forecast threshold is µ = 0.3. The ﬁnancial gains from choosing the data driven trading strategy are presented in Table 4. Two measures, total yearly proﬁts, π, and 5% VaR of daily proﬁts, are presented in the last two columns. First, it can be observed that all the best performing models declassiﬁed the benchmarks. The highest yearly proﬁt from selling 1 MWh was 84, 191 PLN, which was equivalent to around 19, 809 EUR (in the year 2017, the PLN exchange rate oscillated around 1 EUR = 4.25 PLN). At the same time, selling the whole production in the balancing market gave 82,576 PLN (19,430 EUR). Since the naive, balancing market strategy brought substantial proﬁts, it was difﬁcult to beat it. This is reﬂected by the fact that only seven out of 15 presented models gave proﬁts exceeding 82,576 PLN. Proﬁts from selling in the balancing market were burdened with some risk. The VaR showed that in 5% of days, the generator potentially lost, depending on the model speciﬁcation, between 695 PLN and 829 PLN (163–195 EUR). When the performance of different models was analyzed, it was observed that, similar to classiﬁcation power, the most proﬁtable forecasts were provided by ARX models, which separately described prices in the two competing markets. However, it should be noticed that in majority of cases, the model speciﬁcations selected with the p measure did not coincide with those bringing the highest proﬁts, as measured by π. This was particularly valid for probit models, for which only one of the most accurate models was chosen as the top proﬁt yielding model. Finally, the choice of the exogenous variables, lag structure, and the length of the calibration window were compared, based on the results presented in Tables 3 and 4. The results indicated that Energies 2019, 12, 631 10 of 15 the forecasts of the ARX models were more accurate when the parameters were estimated using a full year of observations. On the contrary, the best forecasting probit model utilized only 91 days of data. Similar results were obtained when analyzing the proﬁt level. The lag structure used in the best performing models showed that there was no need to include all lags, L = [2, ..., 7], and it was more efﬁcient to choose L = [2, 7] or L = [2]. Finally, when the choice of the exogenous variables was considered, the outcomes indicated that the most important variable in predicting the price spread sign was the forecasted wind generation, X2. It was included in the majority of the best performing models and model speciﬁcations. As mentioned in Section 3.2, the forecasts based on probit models depend on the assumed level of threshold µ. The total proﬁts, π, for different levels of thresholds are presented in Figure 3. The models are ﬁrst ranked according to their forecast efﬁciency and then the proﬁts, conditional on the threshold level, are presented. It seems that probit models underestimated the probability Prob(Yht = 1), and decreasing the threshold from 0.5 to 0.2 − 0.4 led to an increase of the overall proﬁts. Therefore, Tables 3 and 4 show the results for µ = 0.3. Table 4. The comparison of proﬁts and risks for Polish data.

Germany The German electricity market is one of the most mature in Europe. The intraday market is liquid and allows for adjustment of the trade contracts to varying conditions; for example, intermittent RES generation. Although the electricity prices in the intraday market are, on average, higher than on the day-ahead market (see Table 2), only in 48.9% of cases the price spread ∆Yht is positive. Also, the average price levels seem similar in the two analyzed markets, which makes spread forecasting a demanding exercise. The accuracy of the proposed prediction methods for the German market is summarized in Table 5. Contrary to previous results, the highest classiﬁcation power was achieved by probit models estimated for aggregated data. The probability of a correct decision exceeded 50% only slightly and reached 54.2% for the top ARX models. The performance of the ARX models was slightly worse, and the best speciﬁcation gave correct classiﬁcation in 53.4% of cases. It was observed that, for the top models, the predictive power was q0 > q1, indicating that the models falsely predicted that intraday prices were higher than the day-ahead ones. The results, in terms of total proﬁts and risk, are presented in Table 6. First, it should be noticed that the naïve, intraday strategy led to a low proﬁt, only 676 EUR a year, and a VaR of −156 EUR. This result was signiﬁcantly improved by applying a data-driven approach. All of the presented models increased the proﬁt and, at the same time, decreased the risk measured by VaR. Among them, probit models using the aggregated, daily data dominated by a wide margin. The third-best probit model, with a very short, 30 day calibration window and no exogenous variables, gave a yearly proﬁt of 2880 EUR, which was higher than the best outcome of any other model type. The best probit model used a 182 day calibration window and total load as exogenous, leading to a yearly proﬁt of 3100 EUR. Similar to the Polish market, the two ways of evaluating forecasts—statistical and ﬁnancial—did not coincide. This shows that, from the perspective of the generator, the most proﬁtable model did not necessarily correctly classify all the observations. The reason for this discrepancy is the fact that proﬁts were mainly driven by spikes and price differences, which were large in magnitude. At the same time, most of the observed spreads were close to zero, and hence were less inﬂuential on the ﬁnancial outcome. When model speciﬁcation is considered, outcomes conﬁrmed some of the results obtained for the Polish market. First, the top models, in terms of proﬁts, had a reduced lag structure, with L = [2] or L = [2, 7]. Second, the ARX models performed well for a long, yearly calibration window, whereas probit models provided the best forecasts for medium-length window sizes. Finally, it seems that both exogenous variables—total load and wind generation—affected the spread forecasts signiﬁcantly. The best ARX model used information on both X1 and X2. When probit models are considered, the most proﬁtable one included only the total load. Energies 2019, 12, 631 12 of 15 The effect of the threshold on the performance of probit models is illustrated in Figure 4.

The forecast threshold is µ = 0.4. 5. Conclusions In this article, we focused on predicting the sign of the spread between the day-ahead and the intraday/balancing market prices. Two types of econometric models were examined: ARX and probit models. In both modeling approaches, the dependent variable is linked to past prices and to a set of exogenous variables. Various model speciﬁcations were considered, depending on the data aggregation level, lag structure, length of the calibration window, and the set of exogenous variables. First, the impact of aggregation level on the forecast performance was analyzed. We showed that inclusion of more information does not result in higher proﬁts or more accurate classiﬁcations. The aggregated, daily models provided forecasts which outperformed their disaggregated, hourly counterparts. This outcome shows that the noise included in the hourly data could lead to incorrect trading strategies and, hence, decrease potential proﬁts. Second, different lag structures, L, were compared. We showed that it is reasonable to account for a weekly seasonality by including lag i = 7. On the other hand, the most efﬁcient speciﬁcations restricted the number of lags included in the model, and chose L = [2,7]. The performance of various model speciﬁcations was evaluated for different lengths of the calibration window. This issue has been recently discussed in the literature [26,27]. In particular, Marcjasz et al. [27] showed the impact of the sample size on forecasting accuracy. They indicated that it is sometimes more efﬁcient to use a shorter estimation window, because it can adjust better to the nonlinear behavior of the variables. The results presented in this article conﬁrm these ﬁndings Energies 2019, 12, 631 14 of 15 and show that, for some models, a short (monthly or quarterly) window size is optimal, in terms of accuracy and proﬁts. When the choice of exogenous variables was considered, the results indicated that the relationship between the day-ahead and intraday/balancing prices depends on the behavior of fundamental variables. It can reﬂect two phenomena: Inefﬁcient forecasts of the fundamentals and strategic behavior of market participants. In the ﬁrst case, generators utilize additional information, which is not included in the forecasts, but could be correlated with them. This leads to the dependence of the price difference on the predicted total load/demand or wind generation. Second, market players—conventional generators and trading companies—can strategically choose their imbalances and, hence, decide on a position in the intraday/balancing market in order to optimize their proﬁts and reduce their risk (see [8,24]). Finally, the presented results encourage a discussion on the most accurate forecast evaluation method. We show that traditional measures do not coincide with ﬁnancial measures and, hence, may fail to address questions important for practitioners. Therefore, choosing a model which is best, in terms of classiﬁcation or prediction power, could be misleading and result in lower proﬁts. Some issues, such as the choice of the optimal economic measure or an adjustment of the estimation method to account for ﬁnancial gains, are left for further analysis.
