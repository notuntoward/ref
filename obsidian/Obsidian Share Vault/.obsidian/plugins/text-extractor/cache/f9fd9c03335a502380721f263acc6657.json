Gowda Abstract—The primary objective of this study was to assess the water productivity (WP) of the annual (wheat, barley, and corn) and biennial (alfalfa and Rhodes grass) crops cultivated under center- pivot irrigation located over desert areas of the Al-Kharj region in Saudi Arabia. The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was applied to Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer (ASTER) images to obtain evapotrans- piration (ET) for assessing WP and irrigation performance (IP) of crops. Crop productivity (CP) was estimated using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) crop productivity models. The predicted CP ( ) for corn varied from 12 690 to 14 060 kg/ha and from 6000 to 7370 kg/ha for wheat. The for alfalfa and Rhodes grass was 42 450 and 58 210 (kg/ha/year), respectively. The highest predicted WP was observed in wheat ( ) and the lowest was in alfalfa ( ). The deviation between SEBAL predicted ET ( ) and weather station recorded ET ( ) was 10%. The performance of the prediction models was assessed against the measured data. The overall mean bias/error of the predictions of CP, ET, and WP was 9.4%, , and 9.65%, respectively; the root mean square error (RMSE) was 1996 (kg/ha), 2107 ( ), and 0.09 ( ) for CP, ET, and WP, respectively. When CP was converted into variations between the actual and predicted, the variations were 8% to 12% for wheat, 14% to 20% for corn, 17% to 35% for alfalfa, 3% to 38% for Rhodes grass, and 4% for barley. Index Terms—ASTER image, center-pivot irrigation system, crop productivity, evapotranspiration, water use. I. INTRODUCTION A GRICULTURE is the largest consumer of freshwater in the world [1]. In arid and semiarid environments, competition for freshwater has been steadily increasing among agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors [2]. This competi- tion will further increase with ever growing concerns of climate change and its variability, population growth, economic devel- opment, and environmental impacts. The demand for water in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region that was in 2000 is expected to increase to [3] or [4] in 2050. The rapid dwindling of ﬁnite water resources and the steady increase in demand for food are the major obstacles for attaining agricultural sustainability in Saudi Arabia. Agriculture in general and irrigation in particular consume over 80% of the freshwater used in Saudi Arabia. In 2012, freshwater consumption for the agricultural sector in Saudi Arabia was estimated at 86%—an increase of 6% between 2008 and 2012 [5]. Water used for irrigation is pumped from deep aquifers (up to 1000 m) to feed center-pivot irrigation systems at enormous economic and environmental costs. This situation creates an urgent need for attaining agricultural sustainability, but it is extremely difﬁcult to maintain equilibrium between water and food securities. This critical equilibrium emphasizes the Kingdom’s need for strategic technologies and methods to drastically reduce the current depletion rate of groundwater resources and optimize water consumption without reducing agricultural production. This can only be achieved through the efﬁcient use of irrigation water. Therefore, increasing water productivity (WP) in the agricultural sector is crucial for water conservation efforts that can serve other competitive and critical needs such as domestic, industrial, environmental, and recreational purposes. WP is determined from biological/economic yield of crops and the quantity of water used to produce that yield. It is one of the key indicators for evaluating the efﬁciency of water use in agriculture. Any attempt to improve water use efﬁciency in irrigated agriculture must be based on reliable estimates of seasonal/total evapotranspiration (ET), which has a major impact on water management. ET varies regionally and seasonally according to weather conditions [6]. Understanding the variations in ET is essential for the management of water resources, particularly in hyper-arid regions of Saudi Arabia, where crop water demand exceeds precipitation by several folds and requires irrigation from groundwater resources to meet the deﬁcit. ET values are not only useful for developing WP maps at ﬁeld and regional scales, but are also useful for precision irrigation purposes. Satellite-based remote sensing is a robust, economic, and efﬁcient tool for estimating ET, WP, and the assessment of irrigation performance (IP).

A remote sensing approach overcomes constraints such as data scarcity and scale limitations and reduces uncertainties by covering large spatial domains over time. Various surface energy balance models such as Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) [9], Simpliﬁed Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI) [10], Simpliﬁed Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) [11], and Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [12] have been widely used around the globe for computing ET. The SEBAL model has been predominantly used to estimate ET [9], [13], WP, and IP [14]–[16]. SEBAL was applied to NOAA-AVHRR images to compute the accumulated groundwater abstraction for a 30-year period (1975–2004) in Saudi Arabia, and it was found to be 833 mm per year on average [17]. In another study, census data and crop water requirement models were used for estimating a nationwide abstraction of ground water in Saudi Arabia, which was reported to be for 2010 [18]. In view of the very low WP of the majority of crops grown under center-pivot irrigation systems in Saudi Arabia, there are ample opportunities for signiﬁcant improvement. One of these opportunities was highlighted in a research study conducted to explore the potential of adopting proper cropping pattern based on water demand [19]. The results of that study showed great potential for enhancing food and water security in Saudi Arabia through producing alternate crops in regions where WP is high. In view of the pressing need to assess the WP of agricultural ﬁelds irrigated through center-pivot irrigation systems, this study was undertaken with the goal of developing a WPM using Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery for alfalfa, Rhodes grass, corn, wheat, and barley crops across spatial–temporal domains. The outcome of the study will be helpful in determining both the spatial and temporal variability in WP and in selecting the right crop at the right cultivating season for the optimal use of groundwater resources. II. MATERIALS AND METHODS A. Study Area The study was carried out on the Todhia Arable Farm (TAF), a commercial farm with 47 ﬁelds utilizing center-pivot irrigation systems spread across an area of 6967 ha. The farm lies within the latitudes of and and within the longitudes of and (Fig. 1). Wheat, alfalfa, Rhodes grass, corn, and barley are cultivated to meet the fodder demand of cattle farms. Table I shows the cropping patterns and acreage of the study area. The crop acreage under alfalfa and corn was 580 and 227 ha, respectively, in 2012, and increasing to 900 and 640 ha, respectively, in 2013. The acreage under Rhodes grass and wheat crops decreased from 1430 and 437 ha, respectively, in 2012, to 542 and 100 ha, respectively, in 2013. However, barley was cultivated only in 2013. The season-wide cropping periods of all the investigated crops is provided in Table II. B. Ground Truth Data Collection The geo-referenced data of the ground-measured Normalized Difference Vegetation Index hereafter referred to as and the ground-measured Leaf Area Index hereafter referred to as were collected synchronous to the dates of the satellite overpasses. The and ground truth data collec- tion schedules are presented in Table III. Of the 47 pivots of the farm, 11 pivots (23%) were considered as samples for modeling. About 270 ground-based “point data” of the and were collected from these 11 pivots; approximately, 25 random sample points from each pivot. Of the 270 ground points, 162 points (60%) were used for the develop- ment of NDVI crop productivity (CP) models and the remaining 108 (40%) were used for validation. The location of these sample points is depicted in Fig. 1. The data on the quantity of water applied (WA) and the CP of the harvested crops for all the 47 pivots were obtained from the Fig. 1. Location map of Todhia Arable Farm along with sample locations of ground measurements.

Of these, 11 pivots (23%) were used for modeling and the remaining 36 pivots were used for validation. The was measured in the ﬁeld on the dates of the satellite overpass by using the crop circle (Model ACS-470) of Holland Scientiﬁc, USA. The crop circle device was cali- brated through conﬁguration of a 670-nm ﬁlter in channel 1, an NIR ﬁlter in channel 2 and a 550-nm ﬁlter in channel 3 of the sensor socket for measuring .

To determine the ﬁeld data coordinates, an OmniSTAR GPS receiver (Model 9200-G2) was connected to the Crop Circle at a baud rate of 9600. Field data measurements were recorded with the Crop Circle positioned at 1 m above the crop canopy. The was determined on the dates of the satellite overpass by using the plant canopy analyser (Model PCA- 2200) of LiCOR Biosciences, USA. To compute a single LAI value at each location, one above canopy and ﬁve below canopy readings were recorded. The above and below canopy measure- ments were made by using a “ﬁsheye” optical sensor with a 148 angle of view. Respective geo-locations were collected using a handheld Trimble GPS receiver (Model-Geo XH 600). An azimuth mask of a 180 view cap was used on a PCA-2200 sensor during data collection to obscure the bright sky and thus eliminate the shading effect of the instrument operator. The measured and were used to correct the ASTER-derived NDVI and LAI and subsequently used in the selection of anchor pixels (cold and hot) for the SEBAL model. Meteorological data were collected from an automatic weather station (Vintage Pro2 wireless station) installed at the farm. Meteorological data such as wind speed, humidity, hourly solar radiation, and air temperature were used for processing the net radiation ( ), soil heat ﬂux (G), and sensible heat ﬂux (H) used for the SEBAL Model. The wind speed (u) at the time of the satellite overpass was used for the computation of sensible heat ﬂux (H) and humidity; which were utilized for the estimation of reference ET ( ). Solar radiation data were used for the estimation of the image cloudiness and to adjust the atmospheric transmissivity ( ). A data assimilation approach was used to compute WP. CP and ET data were used to compute the ﬁnal WP map (Fig. 2). C. Processing of ASTER Images Time series of level 1B (ASTL 1 b) ASTER images (Appendix I) pertaining to Paths 164 and 165 procured from Japan Space Systems (Available: http://gds.ersdac.jspacesystems.or.jp) were used in this study to generate the ET, CP, and WP map of the TAF. Of the 15 procured images, 12 were from 2012 and the remaining 3 were from 2013. These images covered the entire range of crop phenology for all crops. In the case of wheat, barley, and corn, the images covered the peak growth stage, whereas the images covered all the growth stages between two harvests/cuts for alfalfa and Rhodes grass. The details of the ASTER data, such as the date of acquisition, the sun elevation angle, the zenith angle, and the distance between sun and earth (which were used in radiometric calibration), are presented in Table IV. The acquired images were georeferenced and radiometrically calibrated by adopting a radiative transfer model using precali- brated coefﬁcients [20]. At sensor, temperatures (K) were ob- tained from thermal bands, as described by Ghulam [21]. The NDVI, which is widely used for the assessment of remotely sensed data, was derived from the visible and near-infrared bands [22]. D. Water Productivity Mapping WP is deﬁned as either the amount of yield produced per unit volume of water (kg of of water) or as a monetary value of the yield produced per unit volume of water [23]. Water Productivity Mapping (WPM) was achieved in three steps: 1) Crop Productivity Mapping (CPM), 2) Water Use (ET) Mapping (WUM) and 3) Water Productivity Mapping (WPM) [23]. Field-measured crop productivity data were related to the NDVI to obtain CP models. The best ﬁt CP models were extrapolated to larger areas by using remotely sensed data to obtain CPM. WUM was prepared by using crop ET. The (per day) was obtained from ASTER data by applying the SEBAL model [9]. WPM was generated for the entire TAF by dividing the CPM by the WUM. 1) Crop Productivity Mapping: CP is a very important end-of- season observation that integrates the cumulative effect of weather and management practices over the entire crop growth season. A remote sensing approach provides both CP assessments and possible variations across ﬁelds. Linear relationships between CP and the NDVI at the crop heading stage were observed [24]. In this study, a scatter plot for each crop was drawn between the corrected ASTER-derived NDVI ( -axis) and CP ( -axis) for the development of CP prediction models. The NDVI at the ear-head emergence stage in wheat and barley, the ﬂag leaf stage in corn, and the ﬂowering stage in alfalfa and Rhodes grass were considered for CP estimations. The CP model was developed using (1) where Y is the predicted CP (kg/ha), X is the NDVI, and and are the constants. Measured CP ( ) data were collected from the TAF records and correlated with the respective ﬁeld’s NDVI derived from ASTER images. Remote sensing-based CP ( ) of corn, barley, and wheat was computed by multiplying the above ground biomass (AGB) by the Harvest Index (HI), a function of the NDVI [25]. Hay yield monitor was used to collect the hay yields for alfalfa and Rhodes grass. A hay yield monitor Model 880 of Fig. 2. Water productivity prediction ﬂow chart. PATIL et al.: ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL WATER PRODUCTIVITY IN DESERT FARMING SYSTEM OF SAUDI ARABIA 287 Harvest Tech., USA, was installed on a large square baler (Claas 3000) for recording the CP data at the time of baling. The hay yield maps were prepared by interpolating the ﬁltered point data to grids using an ordinary kriging tool of ESRI GIS (ver. 2010) [26]. During the preparation of the hay yield maps, low- or high-yielding points associated with signiﬁcant turning and manoeuvring of the baler were removed [27], as were the short segments, which were affected by start or end-pass delays [28]. 2) Water Use Mapping: WUM was accomplished by using crop ET and assuming that the amount of water used by crops was equal to seasonal ET (ETactual). The SEBAL method was used to compute the ETactual on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the instantaneous time of satellite image as the residual amount of energy remaining from the classical energy balance (2) [9] where is the latent heat ﬂux (an instantaneous value for the time of the satellite overpass), is the net radiation at the surface, G is the soil heat ﬂux [calculated using (11)], and H is the sensible heat ﬂux to the air [calculated using (12)]. The unit for all ﬂuxes was . The SEBAL computes as a “residual” of net radiant energy after G and H are subtracted. The ﬁrst step in the SEBAL procedure is to compute by using the surface radiation balance equation (3) where is the net radiation at the surface, is the surface albedo, is the incoming short-wave radiance, is the incoming long-wave radiance, is the outgoing long-wave radiation, and is the surface emissivity. All of these parameters were accomplished in a series of steps using the ERDAS Imagine model maker tool as described in the SEBAL manual [29]. Surface albedo: Georectiﬁed ASTER VNIR bands were sub- jected to Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reﬂectance. This enabled the conversion of image digital numbers (DN) to at-sensor radiance ( ) and subsequently to spectral reﬂectance ( )by adopting the procedures of the ASTER User Manual [20]. The spectral reﬂectance of each band was then used to compute the Albedo-top of the atmosphere ( ) by utilizing the two visible band albedos (4) of Liang [30] and the computed surface albedo ( ) by correcting the (5) where and are the VNIR 1 and VNIR 2 bands of the ASTER image, respectively, and where the path radiance is the average portion of the incoming solar radiation across all bands that is back-scattered to the satellite before it reaches the earth’s surface and is the atmospheric transmissivity. In this study, path-radiance value was considered as 0.03 [31]. The values assume clear sky and relatively dry conditions and are obtained by using an elevation- based relationship: [32], where is the elevation of the weather station above sea level (m). Incoming short-wave radiation ( ): The incoming short- wave radiation is the direct and diffused solar radiation ﬂux that actually reaches the earth’s surface ( ); this was calculated assuming clear sky conditions as a constant for the entire image (6) where is the solar constant ( ), is the cosine of the solar incidence angle, is the inverse squared relative earth-sun distance, and is the atmospheric transmissivity. Outgoing long-wave radiation ( ): The outgoing long- wave radiation is the thermal radiation ﬂux emitted from the earth’s surface to the atmosphere ( ); this was computed by applying the Stefan–Boltzmann equation (7) where is the broad-band surface emissivity (dimensionless), is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant ( ), and is the surface temperature (K). The surface emissivity ( ) was computed using an empirical equation where the NDVI > by inputting the NDVI and the LAI, as described in the SEBAL user manual [29]. Subsequently, the surface temperature ( ) was computed from the ASTER TIR band 13 [21] and used in the computations. Incoming long-wave radiation ( ): The incoming long- wave radiation is the downward thermal radiation ﬂux from the atmosphere ( ) that was computed using the Stefan– Boltzmann equation (8) TABLE IV CHARACTERISTICS OF ASTER DATA USED FOR THE STUDY 288 IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING, VOL. 8, NO. 1, JANUARY 2015 where is the atmospheric emissivity (dimensionless), is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant ( ), and is the near surface air temperature (K). was calculated using (9) [23] where is the atmospheric transmissivity. Substituting (9) into (8) and using from the selected cold pixel for provides the following equation (10): Two anchor (hot and cold) pixels were selected [29] to ﬁx boundary conditions for the energy balance. The cold pixel was selected as a wet, well-irrigated crop surface having full ground cover by vegetation. The surface temperature and near-surface air temperature were assumed to be similar at this pixel. The hot pixel was selected as a dry, bare agricultural ﬁeld where ET was assumed to be zero. Soil heat ﬂux ( ): G is the rate of heat storage into the soil and vegetation due to conduction. It was obtained by using the empirical equation (11) representing values near midday [34] where is the surface temperature ( ), is the surface albedo, the NDVI is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and is the net surface radiation ﬂux. Sensible heat ﬂux ( ): The H is the rate of heat loss to the air by convection and conduction due to a temperature difference. It was computed by using (12) for heat transport where is the air density ( ), is the speciﬁc heat of air (1004 J/kg/K), (K) is the temperature difference, and is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport (s/m). Therefore, H is a function of the temperature gradient, surface roughness, and TABLE V SUMMARY OF GROUND MEASURED NDVI AND LAI TABLE VI NDVI MODELS USED FOR PREDICTING CROP PRODUCTIVITY PATIL et al.: ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL WATER PRODUCTIVITY IN DESERT FARMING SYSTEM OF SAUDI ARABIA 289 wind speed. Equation (12) is difﬁcult to solve because of two unknowns and . To facilitate this computation, we utilized the two selected “anchor” pixels (where reliable values for H can be predicted and a estimated) and the wind speed at a given height (which was obtained from the weather station) as described in the SEBAL manual [29]. The SEBAL procedure (2) was completed by computing the net surface radiation ﬂux ( ) using the surface radiation balance equation (3), the soil heat ﬂux (11), and the sensible heat ﬂux (12). After , G, and the ﬁnal value of H were established, the latter after an iterative process to consider atmospheric stability effects, the Latent Heat (LE) was then calculated as a residual. This is the energy equivalent of the instantaneous ET at the time of satellite overpass. The evaporative fraction (EF) for each pixel was calculated. The , i.e., the rate of LE loss from the surface due to ET, is considered an instantaneous value for the time of satellite overpass used to compute instantaneous ET ( ) and refer- ence evaporative fraction ( ) values by applying (13) and (14) where is the instantaneous ET (mm/h), 3600 is the time conversion from seconds to hours, and is the latent heat of vaporization or the heat observed when a kilogram of water evaporates (J/kg); and where derives from (13) (mm/h) and is the crop- coefﬁcient ( ) of a known crop. This study considers the of alfalfa as the at the time of the image overpass. The daily values of ET ( , mm/day) were computed using (15) and then extrapolated to a growing season or for a particular period employing (16), as described in the SEBAL manual [29] where is the cumulative 24-h for the day of the image, which is calculated by adding the hourly values over the day of the image and is the reference evaporative fraction where the is the representative for the growing season or period, is the daily , and is the number of days in the period. Units for are computed in mm, whereas the is in mm/day.

RESULTS A. and The and were examined across the crops during the study period (Table V). The values ranged between 0.12 (initial stage) and 0.82 (canopy closure stage). The value of alfalfa was 0.62 ( ) and 0.51 ( )in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Meanwhile, Rhodes grass recorded a high value of 0.65 in 2012 and the least value of 0.22 in 2013. The of seasonal crops ranged between 0.63 (wheat) and 0.71 (corn) in 2012; however, it varied from 0.53 (barley) to 0.63 (corn) in 2013. The varied between 0.21 (initial stage) and 6.04 (canopy closure stage). The in the alfalfa crop was 4.51 ( ) and 4.02 ( )in 2012 and 2013, respectively, whereas the for Rhodes grass was 4.50 ( ) and 1.00 ( ) in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In the annual crops, a higher was observed in wheat ( ), followed by corn ( ) during the year 2012. However, in 2013, corn recorded a higher ( ) compared to barley ( ) and wheat ( ). B. CP Models The best relationship between CP and NDVI was obtained when the crops were in mid-season (growth stage), as presented in Table VI. In the annual crops, the best response was observed on the Julian days of 43 (2013), 169 (2012), and 64 (2012) for barley, corn, and wheat crops, respectively, when the crops were at their peak growth stage. In the biennial crops (alfalfa and Rhodes grass), which have a growth period of 30 to 45 days between the two harvests, the best response was observed on the Julian day 201 and 281 of 2012 for Rhodes grass and alfalfa, respectively (Tables VII and VIII). The CP models were validated against the actual CP data recorded on the farm; there was good correlation (Table VI). The root mean square error (RMSE) between the farm recorded and model predicted CP was high in Rhodes grass (24%), followed by alfalfa (21%), corn (18%), and barley (16%), with the least RMSE observed in wheat (15%). However, similar RMSE values were observed in the cross-validation of the models (Table VI). C. CP (kg/ha/season) The results of the predicted and actual ET/crop water use CP and WP for both annual and biennial cops are presented in Table IX. It was observed that predicted CP ( ) varied signiﬁcantly in both temporal and spatial scales. For annual crops, the average for corn was 13 510 and 14 060 for season 1 and 2, respectively, in 2012 and 12 690 in 2013. However, the actual recorded CP ( ) for corn was 10 930 and 11 190 for season 1 and 2, respectively, in 2012, and 10 900 in 2013. Meanwhile, the average for the wheat crop was 6000 and 7370 for season 1 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. But, the for the wheat crop was 5530 and 6510 for season 1 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In the case of barley, the farm recorded mean was 7210 kg/ha, whereas the was 6910 kg/ha, resulting in a mean error of 4.16%. For the biennial crops, the (kg/ha/year) for alfalfa was 42 450 for 2012 and 15 530 for 2013 (up to May 19). The for the alfalfa crop was 35 100 for 2012 and 21 000 for 2013. Although the average for Rhodes grass was 58 210 for 2012 and 24 580 for 2013 (up to May 19), the for Rhodes grass was 60 390 for 2012 and 15 140 for 2013.

Water Use (ET) Mapping ET values were estimated in this study through the analysis of ASTER images using the SEBAL model. The accuracy of the ASTER predicted ET ( ) data using the SEBAL model was tested against the weather station recorded ET ( ) data. The distribution pattern of and is illustrated in Fig. 3. Both the and followed a similar pattern throughout the study period. The correlation between and was further investigated through the regression analysis technique. The results showed a strong linear relationship between and , with an of 0.78 (Fig. 4). The mean deviation of the from the was found to be 10.49%. The (Fig. 5) was then used to assess IP for all of the test crops. The mean values of both and the actual quantity of irrigation WA are presented in Figs. 6 and 7. During the 2011–2012 season, the WA to alfalfa, Rhodes grass and wheat crops was lower than the required quantity as per the . However, during the 2012–2013 season, alfalfa, wheat, and barley crops were irrigated with more than the required quantity of water. Conversely, corn received a higher than required quantity of water during 2011–2012 and a lower than required quantity during 2012–2013. The deviation of from the WA to all of the crops was determined in terms of overall mean error (Fig. 8). The results Fig. 6. ASTERpredicted ET ( ) and the water applied (WA) to biennial crops.

E. Water Productivity As depicted in Fig. 9, the prediction of WP ( ) was more accurate for alfalfa and Rhodes grass crops in 2012. In alfalfa, the was versus an actual WP ( )of . Meanwhile, the for Rhodes grass was versus a of . In 2013 (Fig. 10), the was 2.01, 1.07, 0.68, 0.55, and for wheat, Rhodes grass, barley, corn, and alfalfa, respectively, versus values of 1.63, 0.69, 0.55, 0.51, and 0.43 for the same sequence of crops. IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION As indicated by the regression models, the CP of all the crops showed a visible and signiﬁcant trend across a range of NDVI values. The values were moderate and ranged from 0.5211 (Rhodes grass) to 0.6214 (corn). This is one of the drawbacks of statistical expressions for relationships between the NDVI and the CP [35]. This was also evident in the cross-validation of the models, where the CP data were particularly inconsistent for forage crops due to bias in the selection of the proper growth stage (duration between two harvests) for the CP predictions. Conversely, the seasonal performance of different species, phenology, spectral response, and the establishment of time- dependent relationships with crop vigour and productivity played a major role in developing yield models [36], [37]. Despite this, the obtained values concurred with the earlier reported values. Forexample,inthecaseofthecorncrop,thestrong relationship of the NDVI and the CP estimates occurred in the June (i.e., Julian day, 169) image, with an value of 0.5647; this was considerably higher than the reported values ( ) in a previous study [38], but lower than that reported in another study ( ) [39]. This research gained further support from previous studies on wheat crop, where the lowest CP prediction accuracy was obtained; accurate wheat CP predictions were possible using only one image, provided the image was acquired toward the middle of the growing season when most wheat [40] and corn [41] crop canopies were fully developed. The results of this study showed that spatial distribution of ET could be predicted with an overall accuracy of 90%. The results of the concur with the results of another study that used the SEBAL model to estimate ET in the Philippines, where the ET values deviated by 9% from the ETc (Penman-Monteith) for the ASTER sensor [42]. The obtained results were better than expected, as most remote sensing techniques used for estimating evaporation (E) have accuracies of 70%–85% compared with ground-based measurements [9]. In another study that summa- rized the accuracy of ET prediction using the SEBAL model (although under different climatic conditions), the accuracy at ﬁeld scale was 85% for 1 day and reached 95% on a seasonal basis, whereas the average accuracy of annual ET for large watersheds was observed to be 96% [14]. On an annual/seasonal basis, a deviation of approximately 19% was observed between the and .Whenfocusing ona ﬁner timescale, the model resulted in a large deviation (i.e., to ). The model overestimated the for the ASTER images of June 1, 2012 (63%); June 17, 2012 (47%); July 3 (47%); February 13 (63%); and March 16, 2013 (34%), whereas under- estimated the for the March 20, 2012 (49%); April 21, 2012 (4%); and August 4, 2012 (16%) images. This might be due to the gradation of individual pixels’ evaporative response, which can reﬂect upon the diversity of crops, growth stages, and gradients in soil moisture conditions across the ﬁelds [43], [44]. The WP of alfalfa observed in this study ( ) concurred with the previously reported values ( ) [45]. The harvests made in the cooler months of January–March 2012, November 2012, and February 2013 recorded a higher WP ( ) than the harvests made in warmer months (i.e., 0.23–0.40). It is evident that alfalfa, being a plant, is adapted to cuttings made in cooler seasons but loses its efﬁciency during the summer season [46]. This large amount of variation may be attributed to the inﬂuence of both spatial and seasonal climatic variations on ET, alfalfa produc- tivity, and water use efﬁciency. Similar results were reported Fig. 8. Accuracy assessment of predicted ET ( ) vs. Water applied (WA). Fig. 9. ASTER predicted ( ) vs. Actual ( ) water productivity for 2012. Fig. 10. ASTER predicted ( )vs. Actual ( ) water productivity for 2013. PATIL et al.: ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL WATER PRODUCTIVITY IN DESERT FARMING SYSTEM OF SAUDI ARABIA 293 when comparisons were made between CP and ET for individual harvests, where the relationship varied across the growing season and changed depending on the harvest time [47]. A better correlation between the and ﬁeld recorded for the entire farm was observed, with an of 0.7967 ( < )as shown in Fig. 11. Meanwhile, among the three annual crops, there were considerable differences between the and in wheat and barley ( plants) but not in corn ( plant). In the case of wheat, the ( ) values of 0.80–2.01 closely resembled the values of 0.1–2.07 [48], but were higher than the values of 0.51–1.50 reported by others [49]–[52]. The lower WP observed in the earlier studies could be due to the lowerCPof4.3–4.88 t/ha [49], [50] compared to 6.0 t/ha in the present study. For corn, the ( ) concurred with the WP ( ) reported earlier from Iran [53]. However, there were other reports with much higher WP values of [54], [55]. The WP values of observed in Rhodes grass resembled earlier reported values of [56] and [57], but were lower than the values ( ) reported by ICARDA [58]. In the case of barley, the and values were 0.68 ( ) and 0.55 ( ) , respectively. The values were within the range of values reported in Mediterranean environments [59], [60]. The performance of the prediction models was assessed against the recorded/measured data (Table X). The overall percentage bias values for CP, ET, and WP were 9.4%, , and 9.65%, respectively, whereas the RMSE values were 1996 (kg/ha), 2107 ( ), 0.087 ( ) for CP, ET, and WP, respectively. When converted into variations between the actual and the predicted CP, the variations were 8%–12% for wheat, 14%–20% for corn, 4% for barley, 17%–35% for alfalfa, and 3%–38% for Rhodes grass. Although the performance of the models varied among crops and across seasons/years, the pre- diction bias values were within acceptable limits. Based on the results of this study, it can be inferred that WP of wheat was consistently higher than all the other studied crops. Further, among the fodder crops, corn recorded higher WP compared to extensively cultivated crops such as alfalfa and Rhodes grass. The results of this research work were shared with few agricultural companies. As a result, there was a shift in the cropping pattern on TAF in 2013, wherein the area under corn increased and the area under Rhodes grass decreased as com- pared to the previous year. This study also concludes that the SEBAL algorithm using ASTER images provided realistic estimates of ET, CP, and WP for the crops (corn, wheat, barley, Rhodes grass, and alfalfa) cultivated under center-pivot irrigation system in Saudi Arabia. There was concurrence between the predicted and actual values of CP and WP. However, the predicted daily ET values signiﬁ- cantly deviated from the meteorological data, particularly in summer months (June–September); this issue warrants further empirical research.
