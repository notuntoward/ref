(“Employer”), and Scott Otterson (the “Employee”). Employer and Employee are referred to collectively as the “Parties” or individually as the “Party”. WHEREAS, Employee has been employed by Employer and has served most recently in the role of Staff Data Scientist. WHEREAS, the Parties have agreed to terminate the existing employment relationship; and WHEREAS, the Parties desire to resolve any differences and disputes now pending or which may arise in the future with respect to Employee’s employment and the termination thereof. THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, and the mutual promises, agreements and understandings contained herein, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 1. Separation of Employment. Employee’s last day of employment with Employer will be effective as of the end of normal business day on 8/20/2024 (the “Employment Separation Date”). After the Employment Separation Date, the Employee will not represent himself as being an employee, officer, attorney, agent, or representative of the Employer for any purpose. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the Employment Separation Date is the employment termination date for the Employee for all purposes, meaning the Employee is not entitled to any further compensation, monies, or other benefits from the Employer, including coverage under any benefit plans or programs sponsored by the Employer, as of the Employment Separation Date. 2. Payments. (A) Whether Employee signs this Agreement or not, Employee acknowledges and agrees that he or she has been paid all wages and compensation, including accrued but unused vacation, due Employee as of the Employment Separation Date. After Employee’s last day worked, Employee will not accrue nor be entitled to any employer-provided benefits (including, without limitation paid time off, sick leave, and 401(k)) and Employee acknowledges and agrees that, except as required by COBRA or other applicable law, the Employer shall have no obligation to continue health benefits. Employee further agrees that as of the date of him or her signing this Agreement, he or she had no outstanding claims for indemnification of any expenses or liabilities incurred during his or her employment, nor any other pending claims against the Employer. (B) Employer shall pay to Employee an amount equal to 5 weeks of base salary minus applicable deductions and withholdings as required by law and two (2) months of COBRA health care coverage for the Employee and his/her family since the Employment Separation Date (these payments are collectively referred to as the “Severance Payment”). Employee should provide the verification of payments made to COBRA for Employer to reimburse such amounts. If he/she does not have health care coverage through Employer, Employer shall pay to Employee the {00012631;2} 2 Separation and Release of Claims Agreement equivalent amounts of his/her health benefits premiums in cash. In such a case, documentation shall be provided to the Employer that verifies the coverage tier (Employee Only, Employee + Spouse/Domestic Partner, Employee + Child(ren), Employee + Family) of the Employee at the Employment Separation Date. Employee shall be solely responsible for timely remitting the COBRA payment, and for any and all taxes that may be applicable to any portion of the Severance Payment. (C) Employer will pay the Severance Payment only if Employee signs the Agreement and complies with its terms. Employer will not be required to provide the Severance Payment until after this Agreement becomes effective. (D) Employee agrees to direct all requests for references to the Employer’s Human Resources Department. In response to a request for a reference, the Employer shall provide only the Employee’s dates of employment and job title. Employee understands, acknowledges, and agrees that these benefits exceed what Employee is otherwise entitled to receive on separation from employment, and that these benefits are being given as consideration in exchange for executing this Agreement, including the general release contained in it. Employee further acknowledges that he or she is not entitled to any additional payment or consideration not specifically referenced in this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed as an express or implied policy or practice of the Employer to provide these or other benefits to any individuals other than the Employee. 3.
