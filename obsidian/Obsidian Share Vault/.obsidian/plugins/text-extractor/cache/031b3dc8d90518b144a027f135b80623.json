McGlone and Jessica Tofighbakhsh Lafayette College AbstractÐWe explored the role that poetic form can play in people's perceptions of the accuracy of aphorisms as descriptions of human behavior. Participants judged the ostensible accuracy of unfamiliar aphorisms presented in their textually surviving form or a semanti- cally equivalent modified form. Extant rhyming aphorisms in their original form (e.g., ªWhat sobriety conceals, alcohol revealsº) were judged to be more accurate than modified versions that did not pre- serve rhyme (ªWhat sobriety conceals, alcohol unmasksº). However, the perceived truth advantage of rhyming aphorisms over their modi- fied forms was attenuated when people were cautioned to distinguish aphorisms' poetic qualities from their semantic content. Our results suggest that rhyme, like repetition, affords statements an enhancement in processing fluency that can be misattributed to heightened convic- tion about their truthfulness. Aphorisms are succinct statements that offer observations and ad- vice about universal human concerns such as happiness (e.g., ªBetter to be happy than wiseº), health (ªAn apple a day keeps the doctor awayº), and friendship (ªBirds of a feather flock togetherº). Although they enjoy a reputation among laypeople as distillations of age-old psychological wisdom, aphorisms are commonly characterized by psychologists as dubious generalizations to be contrasted with more precise scientific descriptions of human behavior (Gibbs & Beitel, 1995; Teigen, 1986). To this end, many introductory psychology text- books draw attention to the existence of apparently contradictory pairs of aphorisms such as ªBirds of a feather flock togetherº versus ªOpposites attractº and ªOut of sight, out of mindº versus ªAbsence makes the heart grow fonderº (Baron, Byrne, & Kantowitz, 1980; Taylor & Manning, 1975). Presumably, a set of statements about behavior can be considered scientifically ªaccurateº only if each state- ment's truth conditions can be operationalized and the statements do not contradict each other (Dowty, Wall, & Peters, 1981). However, the notorious vagueness of aphorisms makes specification of their truth conditions especially difficult. For example, what conditions must be satisfied for the statement ªHaste makes wasteº to be true? Which forms of urgent action constitute ªhasteº? How does one dis- tinguish a priori between a situation in which ªHaste makes wasteº is good advice and one in which ªHe who hesitates is lostº would be more appropriate? If the persuasive force of an aphorism depended critically on the clarity of its truth conditions, we should find it sur- prising that people invest any belief in such statements. Given the murkiness of aphorisms' truth conditions, why might people believe that such statements describe human behavior accu- rately? One important factor is an aphorism's familiarity (Higbee & Millard, 1983). For example, consider the well-worn observation that ªopposites attract.º American college students not only are highly familiar with this aphorism, but also judged it to be a more accurate description of companion selection than novel statements that entail the same claim (e.g., ªPeople with divergent interests and personali- ties tend to be drawn to one anotherº; McGlone & Necker, 1998). The conflation of familiarity and accuracy in aphorisms is consistent with experimental demonstrations of the influence of repetition on people's judgments of statements with uncertain truth value (Bacon, 1979; Begg, Anas, & Farinacci, 1992; Begg & Armour, 1991; Hasher, Gold- stein, & Toppino, 1977). For example, Hasher et al. (1977) found that repetition of unsubstantiated trivia statements (e.g., ªDivorce is found only in technically advanced societiesº) produced a systematic shift in their rated truth value: Repeated statements were judged as more likely to be true than nonrepeated statements. Begg et al. (1992) characterized this and other demonstrations of the ªillusory truthº effect as evidence that a fluency heuristic operates in people's judg- ment of a statement's truth; repetition increases a statement's famil- iarity, and the processing fluency that familiarity affords the statement is misattributed to belief in its propositional truth (cf. Whittlesea, 1993). Although fluency of this sort might contribute to people's belief in conventional aphorisms such as ªHaste makes waste,º it does not encourage belief in unfamiliar aphorisms such as ªVariety pre- vents satiety.º Yet unfamiliar aphorisms often seem to have a ªring of truthº as well, their dubious truth conditions notwithstanding. What characteristics of unfamiliar aphorisms might contribute to this perception? The present study focuses on the role that aesthetic properties of an aphorism can play in people's (specifically, readers') perceptions of its truthfulness. Although these statements' reputation as kernels of psychological wisdom may be dubious, their reputation as verbal art forms is well deserved. Aphorisms employ many of the aesthetic devices exalted in poetry, including metaphor (e.g., ªOppression is the mother of libertyº), alliteration (ªFortune favors the foolº), assonance (ªA rolling stone gathers no mossº), and rhyme (ªHaste makes wasteº; Gibbs & Beitel, 1995; Odlin, 1986). Traditionally, literary scholars have classified these devices as aspects of aphoristic form that are separate from propositional content (e.g., Goodwin & Wenzel, 1979). In his seminal work on structuralist poetics, Culler (1975) acknowledged this distinction by suggesting that the rhetorical effec- tiveness of an aphorism depends on the ªobservable accuracy of its meaningº (i.e., content) and ªthe aesthetic pleasure afforded by its formº (p. 143). Although the distinction between content and form clearly has analytic value, it has not been established that readers routinely sepa- rate the contributions that these components make to their overall appreciation of an aphorism (McGlone & Tofighbakhsh, 1999). For example, consider how readers might respond differently to ªVariety prevents satietyº and a slightly modified version of this statement, ªVariation prevents satiety.º The two statements do not differ appre- ciably in propositional content, but the former has an aesthetic ele- ment (i.e., repetition of the stressed vowel and subsequent speech sounds in two or more words, or rhyme; Brogan, 1994) that the latter Address correspondence to Matthew S.

If readers distinguish between the propositional content of the aphorism and its poetic form, then there should be no difference in the perceived accuracy of the rhyming and nonrhyming versions. However, rhyme, like familiarity, can increase the fluency with which words forming a statement are recognized and understood (Meyer, Schvaneveldt, & Ruddy, 1975; Rubin, 1995). For example, Meyer et al. (1975) found that people are faster to judge that a string of letters presented visually is a word if it is preceded by a rhyming prime word than if it is preceded by a nonrhyming prime. This effect is observed even when the prime word is presented auditorily, suggesting that lexical activation (as opposed to simple graphemic correspondence) is the locus of facilitation (Hillinger, 1980). If, as Begg et al. (1992) have argued, people base their judgments of a statement's accuracy in part on the fluency with which the statement is processed, then the fluency that rhyme affords an aphorism may confer upon the state- ment a perceived truth advantage over a semantically equivalent non- rhyming version. Such an advantage would indicate that the traditional analytic distinction between a statement's ªrhyme and rea- sonº (i.e., form and content) is not always appreciated by readers; in some circumstances, rhyme may be treated as reason. In this article, we report an experiment exploring the influence of poetic form on people's perceptions of aphorisms' accuracy as de- scriptions of human behavior. This experiment tested two distinct hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that people would misattribute the processing fluency produced by an aphorism's rhyming form to heightened conviction about the statement's accuracy (following Begg et al., 1992), relative to a semantically equivalent nonrhyming version of the aphorism. Second, we predicted that this misattribution would be attenuated when people were prompted to attribute process- ing fluency to its actual source (cf. Schwarz & Clore, 1996; Whit- tlesea, Jacoby, & Girard, 1990). Specifically, we expected that people advised to distinguish aphorisms' poetic qualities from their proposi- tional content would be less prone to exhibit the ªrhyme as reasonº effect. METHOD Participants For participating in this experiment, 120 Lafayette undergraduates received extra credit in a course they were taking. Twenty participated in the materials check and 100 in the experiment proper. All were native English speakers. Materials Initially, 50 rhyming and 50 nonrhyming aphorisms were selected from published aphorism collections using the following criteria: (a) The aphorism was an advisory or descriptive statement about human behavior (as opposed to a value judgment or opinion, which people might be hesitant to judge as accurate or inaccurate); (b) it was not similar in meaning to another selected aphorism; and (c) it was un- familiar to the authors. For each extant (i.e., textually surviving) rhyming aphorism (e.g., ªWhat sobriety conceals, alcohol revealsº), a modified version was created by replacing one of the rhyming words with a close synonym that did not rhyme with any of the other words in the statement (e.g., ªWhat sobriety conceals, alcohol unmasksº). For each extant nonrhyming aphorism (e.g., ªBenefaction is the most difficult weapon to conquerº), a modified version was created by replacing a content word with a close synonym that did not rhyme with any of the other words in the statement (e.g., ªBenefaction is the most difficult weapon to overcomeº). 1 The extant nonrhyming apho- risms and their modified counterparts were included in the stimulus materials to control for the possibility that a perceived truth advantage for an extant rhyming aphorism over a nonrhyming version might be attributable not to rhyme per se, but rather to modification of the statement's textually surviving form. We expected that if the latter were true, we would observe a truth advantage for the extant non- rhyming aphorisms over their modified counterparts as well. On the basis of a pilot experiment (n 4 20), we chose 30 pairs (original plus modified version) from each of the rhyming and non- rhyming aphorism sets. A pair was selected only if all participants indicated that (a) they could not recall having read or heard the origi- nal aphorism in the past and (b) they did not perceive a difference in meaning between the original and modified versions. Examples of the selected pairs are presented in Table 1. Two lists were created from these materials. Each list contained 60 aphorisms: 15 extant rhyming aphorisms in their original form and 15 in modified (i.e., nonrhyming) form, and 15 extant nonrhyming aphorisms in their original form and 15 in modified form. Only one version of each extant aphorism ap- peared in each list. Although the order in which the aphorisms ap- peared was randomized, a given aphorism and its modified form were in the same position in their respective lists. Design and Procedure This experiment employeda2×2×2 design with aphorism type (extant rhyming or nonrhyming) and version (original or modified) as within-subjects factors and instruction condition (control or warning) as a between-subjects factor. Upon arrival in the laboratory, partici- pants were randomly assigned to one of the aphorism lists and an instruction condition. The first page of each questionnaire indicated that the experiment was part of a larger study exploring the psycho- logical theories implied by English aphorisms and provided instruc- tions for the accuracy ratings. Participants were instructed to read each aphorism carefully and then to rate the degree to which they perceived the aphorism as ªan accurate description of human behavior,º on a scale from 1 (not at all accurate)to9(very accurate). In the control- instructions condition, the instructions did not include any mention of or admonition concerning the distinction between aphorisms' poetic qualities and their ostensible accuracy. In contrast, instructions in the warning condition specifically cautioned participants to base their accuracy judgments ªonly on the claim that the statement makes about behavior, not the poetic quality of the statement's wording.º This caveat was presented in boldface type in the instructions, and was further emphasized by the observation that ªa statement might strike you as quite poetic, but not particularly accurate; on the other hand, a statement might strike you as quite accurate, but not particularly poetic.º After participants in both conditions completed the accuracy rat- ings, they were asked the following yes/no question: ªIn your opinion, do aphorisms that rhyme describe human behavior more accurately than those that do not rhyme?º After responses to this question were 1. Although it would have been ideal to construct modified rhyming ver- sions of the extant nonrhyming aphorisms (thus putting assignment of state- ments to the rhyming and nonrhyming conditions under the experimenter's control), it was impossible in most cases for us to create such versions that adequately preserved the meaning of the originals.

On average, the experimental sessions lasted 25 min. RESULTS Initial analyses did not reveal main effects or interactions involv- ing stimulus list, so subsequent analyses collapsed across this factor. Separate analyses of variance were conducted on the ratings data treating participants (Fp) and items (Fi) as random factors. Analyses of the accuracy ratings indicated that, overall, there were no reliable differences in mean ratings between extant rhyming and nonrhyming aphorisms (5.51 and 5.45, respectively) or original and modified ver- sions (5.63 and 5.35), p > .10 in both cases. However, participants in the control-instructions condition generated slightly higher ratings overall than those in the warning condition (5.68 and 5.26), Fp(1, 98) 4 2.79, p < .08, and Fi(1, 58) 4 2.63, p < .12. This marginal effect was moderated by a reliable Aphorism Type × Version × Instruction Condition interaction, Fp(1, 98) 4 7.84, p < .01, and Fi(1, 58) 4 5.58, p < .02. The relevant means are presented in Figure 1. Planned analytical comparisons (Keppel, Saufley, & Tokunaga, 1992) were used to investigate differences among the means. As we predicted, participants who were not cautioned to distinguish aphorisms' seman- tic content from their poetic qualities (the control-instructions condi- tion) assigned higher accuracy ratings to the original rhyming aphorisms than their modified counterparts (6.17 and 5.26), Fp(1, 98) 4 12.77, p < .01, and Fi(1, 58) 4 8.62, p < .03; however, they assigned comparable ratings to the original and modified nonrhyming aphorisms (5.79 and 5.51), Fp(1, 98) 4 1.21, p > .10, and Fi(1, 58) 4 0.82. The fact that the difference in ratings between aphorism versions was reliable for the extant rhyming aphorisms, but not the nonrhyming aphorisms, suggests that the difference is attributable specifically to manipulation of rhyme in the former and not simply to the modifica- tion of their textually surviving form. 2 Participants in the warning condition exhibited a markedly differ- ent pattern of accuracy ratings. The original rhyming aphorisms were assigned reliably lower accuracy ratings in this condition than in the control condition (5.42 and 6.17), Fp(1, 98) 4 4.79, p < .05, and Fi(1, 58) 4 4.26, p < .05. In addition, in the warning condition, there were no reliable differences in participants' ratings for original and modi- fied versions of the extant rhyming aphorisms (5.42 and 5.17), Fp(1, 98) 4 0.96, and Fi(1, 58) 4 0.65, or of the extant nonrhyming aphorisms (5.14 and 5.36), Fp(1, 98) 4 0.75, and Fi(1, 58) 4 0.52. Thus, bringing the distinction between an aphorism's poetic qualities and semantic content to participants' attention had the desired effect of thwarting their tendency to conflate fluency with perceived accu- racy. However, there is no evidence that this tendency in the control condition stemmed from an explicit belief that rhyming aphorisms are more accurate than nonrhyming ones. When asked if they held such a belief, all participants in both conditions responded ªnoº (and many gave us quizzical looks). DISCUSSION In The Gay Science, Nietzsche (1878/1986) attributed the origin of poetry to a primitive belief that rhythm and rhyme could confer magi- cal powers to the words of prayers, carrying them ªcloser to the ears of the gods.º Although this superstition was dismissed long ago in most cultures, Nietzsche observed that ªeven no w...thewisest among us are still occasionally fooled by rhythmÐif only insofar as we sometimes consider an idea truer because it has a metrical form and presents itself with a divine spark and jumpº (pp. 139±140, em- phasis added). Our results offer some support for Nietzsche's claim: Participants conflated the rhyme and perceived accuracy of aphorisms unless they were explicitly instructed to distinguish the statements' semantic content from their poetic qualities. This occurred despite the fact that participants did not read the aphorisms aloud, which would 2. A second possibility is that the perceived truth advantage was attribut- able in part to modification of the rhyming aphorisms' meter. It proved diffi- cult in many cases for us to create modified versions of these aphorisms in which rhyming words were replaced with synonyms that had the same number of syllables and stress pattern as the replaced words, thereby preserving both the meanings and the meter of the statements; however, we were able to do this for 14 of the 30 rhyming aphorisms used (see examples in Table 1). We found no differences in the pattern of accuracy ratings for these aphorism pairs and those in which the modified version preserved only the meaning of the original. Thus, we tentatively conclude that the meter confound did not contribute appreciably to the effect reported. Table 1.

PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE Rhyme as Reason VOL. 11, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 2000426 at QUEENS UNIV LIBRARIES on March 7, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from have made those that rhymed especially salient. Among the prosodic poetic devices (e.g., alliteration, assonance), rhyme is the first that children learn to appreciate and one that adults routinely notice even during silent reading (Hayes, Chemelski, & Palmer, 1982). Thus, it is not surprising that participants discriminated between the rhyming and nonrhyming aphorisms in the stimulus lists. What is surprising is that they discriminated between these forms in terms of accuracy, even though none of them reported believing that rhyme confers a truth advantage on such statements. Psychologists have documented that people are often unaware of factors that influence their judgments (e.g., Nisbett & Wilson, 1977). However, barring an unconscious belief in the magical power of rhyme on the part of our participants, what accounts for the rhyme-as-reason effect? We suggest that this effect is a product of the enhanced processing fluency that rhyme affords an aphorism such as ªWhat sobriety con- ceals, alcohol revealsº relative to a semantically equivalent nonrhym- ing version. Although enhanced processing fluency is often the consequence of repeated exposure to a stimulus (Begg et al., 1992; Jacoby & Kelley, 1987), it can also be produced by factors in the present stimulus environment. For example, manipulations of fluency such as adjusting the figure-ground contrast or presentation duration of a stimulus produce misattributions akin to those generated by rep- etition manipulations (Reber, Winkielman, & Schwarz, 1998; Whit- tlesea, 1993). When these manipulated factors are brought to people's attention, misattribution of processing fluency to other psychological dimensions (e.g., liking, familiarity) is attenuated (Whittlesea et al., 1990). In the same fashion, our participants misattributed processing fluency to a perceived truth advantage of rhyming aphorisms over nonrhyming versions; however, when they were cautioned to distin- guish an aphorism's poetic form from its semantic content, the ad- vantage was significantly reduced. Although we have explored the rhyme-as-reason effect within the narrow domain of antiquated sayings, it clearly can occur in contem- porary communications as well. Consider defense attorney Johnnie Cochran's celebrated plea to the jury during O.J. Simpson's criminal trial: ªIf the gloves don't fit, you must acquit!º Journalists have fo- cused almost exclusively on the mnemonic value of rhyme in this statement: Rhyme increased the likelihood that jurors would rehearse, remember, and thus apply Cochran's directive (Buckley, 1997). How- ever, the fluent quality of the statement undeniably overshadows its dubious propositionÐafter all, the jury was obligated to consider all of the presented evidence, not just the tight gloves! We wonder how persuasive the jury might have found this proposition had Cochran proclaimed, ªIf the gloves don't fit, you must find him not guilty!º AcknowledgmentsÐ A preliminary report of this research was presented at the annual convention of the American Psychological Society in Wash- ington, D.C., June 1998.
