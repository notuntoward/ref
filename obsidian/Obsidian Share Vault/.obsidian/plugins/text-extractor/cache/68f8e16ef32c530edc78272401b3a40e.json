America is less polarized than it used to be. \u0000e gulfs between groups of voters shrank in the recent election. 6 min 403 By Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos is the Kirkland and Ellis professor of law at Harvard Law School. Here‚Äôs a shocker: One of the unnoticed themes of the recent election was depolarization. The electoral chasms between groups of voters shrank compared with four years earlier. Make sense of the latest news and debates with our daily newsletter Today at 5:45 a.m. EST Voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5 in Philadelphia. (Caroline Gutman for \u0000e Washington Post) 12/16/24, 8:36 PM Opinion | American voters are less polarized than they used to be - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 1/8 This was true across several axes and is mostly attributable to traditional Democratic constituencies moving to the right. If these trends endure, they promise a new political era. Donald Trump‚Äôs gains among minority voters have already been the subject of much coverage. According to AP VoteCast, the share of Black voters supporting Trump increased from 8 percent in 2020 to 16 percent in 2024. Trump‚Äôs fraction of the Latino vote rose from 35 percent to 43 percent. The relative stability of the White vote, though, has attracted less attention. Fifty- five percent of White voters backed Trump in 2020, and just one percentage point more did so in 2024. This combination of minority voters shifting rightward and White voters staying put resulted in the lowest level of racially polarized voting in a generation. The Black-White gap in Trump support declined from 47 percentage points in 2020 to 40 points in 2024. The Latino- White gap fell from 20 points to 13 points. Racial depolarization may have gotten the headlines, but the near-disappearance of age as an electoral divide was even more dramatic. The share of the youngest voters (ages 18 to 29) supporting Trump grew from 36 percent to 47 percent over the past four years. In contrast, Trump registered no improvement at all with the oldest voters (ages 65 or older), of whom 51 percent backed him in both elections. The gap between the youngest and the oldest voters‚Äô 12/16/24, 8:36 PM Opinion | American voters are less polarized than they used to be - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/8 choices therefore plummeted from 15 percentage points in 2020 to four points in 2024. More Opinions On The Elections Another facet of depolarization in the election was geographic. Trump‚Äôs fraction of the vote in the most densely populated areas (such as those comprising New York City) spiked by up to 10 percentage points. On the other hand, his vote share in counties of low or moderate density went up only incrementally, by about two points. Accordingly, after decades of divergence, urban and rural areas edged closer to each other politically. üé§Follow Opinions on the news Opinion Perry Bacon Centrist Democrats should stop blaming progressives for Harris‚Äôs loss Opinion E.J.

According to that poll, the share of women voting for Trump increased by six percentage points from 2020 to 2024, while Trump‚Äôs fraction of the male vote remained flat. This reduced the male-female gap in Trump support from nine points to three. (AP VoteCast and national exit polls don‚Äôt confirm this finding, however.) What explains this convergence? The superficial answer is that historically Democratic groups swerved to the right while long-standing Republican constituencies didn‚Äôt budge. Minority members, young people, city dwellers and women ‚Äî they‚Äôve all been Democratic stalwarts, and they all moved toward Trump. The only major Democratic cohort that didn‚Äôt shift rightward was people with at least a college degree. Conversely, White, old, rural and male voters are pillars of the modern Republican coalition. Surprisingly, they mostly resisted the pro-Trump swing among the rest of the electorate. But why were historically Democratic groups more open to Trump‚Äôs overtures this time around? One possibility is that these groups were particularly harmed by high inflation during Joe Biden‚Äôs presidency. Notably, most of the Democrats who voted for Trump had a lower 12/16/24, 8:36 PM Opinion | American voters are less polarized than they used to be - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 4/8 income and less education than other members of the party‚Äôs coalition. Members higher in socioeconomic status didn‚Äôt move toward Trump at all. The media diets of young voters might also be responsible. Young voters are the age cohort that‚Äôs least likely to get news from print publications, television and radio. In turn, lower news attentiveness was linked to higher support for Trump in the election. More From Opinions Depolarization was obviously great news for Trump. It was the key to his victory, enabling him to win despite making scant progress with traditional Republican constituencies. If these new voting patterns hold, they could turn Republicans into the ‚Äúparty of the people,‚Äù as GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini put it ‚Äî a working- class party for voters of all races, ages, regions Opinion Elisabeth Rosenthal How everything became surgery Opinion Heathe A Michigan plan to end t crisis 12/16/24, 8:36 PM Opinion | American voters are less polarized than they used to be - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 5/8 and genders. In this future, the one divide that would stick would be socioeconomic, pitting richer and more educated Democrats against everybody else. In this partition of the electorate, Democrats would have the smaller share and so would be consigned to long-term minority status. Yet depolarization could also benefit Democrats by facilitating the translation of their votes into political power. At the presidential level, the tipping-point state that gave Trump his electoral college majority in 2024 ‚Äî Pennsylvania ‚Äî was just 0.6 percentage points more Republican than the national popular vote. By comparison, the tipping-point state in 2020, Wisconsin, was 3.8 points more Republican than the country as a whole. The gap between the tipping-point state and the nation shrank (in part) because the pivotal Midwest has relatively few of the minority voters among whom Trump‚Äôs gains were concentrated. If this low bias persists in future elections, Democrats would need only a small shift in their favor (on the order of two points) to retake the presidency. Similarly, the House of Representatives is on track to be less skewed, in aggregate, than at any time since the early 1990s. A common measure of the House‚Äôs bias compares the election result in the median House district with the national popular vote. In the coming Congress, the median House district will have almost the same partisan slant ‚Äî a slight Republican tilt ‚Äî as the 12/16/24, 8:36 PM Opinion | American voters are less polarized than they used to be - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 6/8 country as a whole. And again, some of the credit is due to depolarization. Republicans‚Äô improvement in cities slashed the margins of many urban Democratic legislators but failed to flip any of their seats. As a result, Democratic urban districts are no longer safer than Republican rural districts ‚Äî and no longer waste more votes unnecessary to hold the seats. Down the road, these developments could hand Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) the speaker‚Äôs gavel even if Democrats eke out only a narrow majority of the national House vote. But put aside what depolarization might mean for the parties. For our democracy writ large, its consequences are mostly positive. A less polarized electorate is one less vulnerable to microtargeting with distinct messages for different communities. It‚Äôs one more apt to move uniformly in response to conditions domestically and abroad. It‚Äôs one that dampens politicians‚Äô incentive to suppress or dilute any group‚Äôs votes. And it‚Äôs one that may foster a less bitter, more constructive kind of politics. Concern about the short term, then, shouldn‚Äôt occlude a ray of hope for the long run. If the new electoral landscape lasts, it could eventually be a boon for the country.
