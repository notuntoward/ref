Photo via YouTube Hello! A million years ago, and by that I mean January , I wrote about how both Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns were going to harness the energy of influencers this election. I may have actually underestimated just how much creators would play a role in the White House race, from podcasts to TikTok and super influencers like X-owner Elon Musk. But the campaigns diverged in how much they tapped creators for outreach. President-Elect Donald Trump, who used his megaphone on Twitter (now X) so ef fectively in 2016, this year spent far more time with creators, who multiplied that message— including to core groups like young men, or what election analysts have dubbed the “bro vote.” 11/11/24, 7:57 PM Scotto Mail - Creator Economy: How Trump Used Influencers to Win Over Voters https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=4a105ce404&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1815014284144797412&simpl=msg-f:1815014284144797… 2/11 Here’s how they fared: Podcasts Looking back at our chart of Trump and V ice President Kamala Harris’ podcast appearances during their presidential campaigns is extremely telling now . While both campaigns heavily embraced creators in dif ferent ways, Trump spent much more time sitting down for lengthy chats with popular hosts, ranging from Joe Rogan to the “All-In” besties and Logan Paul, than Harris did. Trump went on at least 20 shows, with nearly half of those appearances happening in October . In contrast, Harris appeared on just four podcasts, by our count, and none of them, such as Alex Cooper , endorsed her . She coupled those shows with a few traditional media appearances like “60 Minutes” and “The View,” the latter of which backfired. When asked on the daytime talk show if she would have done anything dif ferently than President Biden during his term, she said: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.” The Trump campaign seized on that answer . Podcasts, a medium that's been around for more than 20 years, more recently has proved a fantastic way for creators to speak 11/11/24, 7:57 PM Scotto Mail - Creator Economy: How Trump Used Influencers to Win Over Voters https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=4a105ce404&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1815014284144797412&simpl=msg-f:1815014284144797… 3/11 intimately and directly to their fans. The candidates, particularly Trump, recognized the value of that connection. Social Media Trump benefited from Musk's full-throated support of his candidacy after the July attempted assassination of Trump. Musk, who has about 203 million followers, used X constantly to fire of f support for Trump. Trump also cozied up to conservative-friendly creators like streamer Adin Ross and the Nelk Boys. (His 18-year-old son, Barron, reportedly is a fan of Ross and advised him on some of these strategies.) Trump also notched endorsements from big- name creators, including Rogan and Jake Paul. These ef forts seem to have shown up in the vote: Trump won 18- to-29-year-old men by 13 percentage points, according to The Wall Street Journal. In 2020, Biden won that group by 15 percentage points. Trump also threw his support behind the Republican National Convention’s decision to give access to more than 100 creators to the major political convention for the first time. Harris’ campaign staf fed up with creator partnership roles, and rallied creators for their support up until the final 24 hours of the campaign to get out the vote.

She saw a huge groundswell of support this summer online, as coconut tree and “brat” summer memes in support of her abounded on TikTok and social media. At the time, it felt organic and was embraced as cool with Gen Z. But the memes ultimately didn’t tell voters much about her platform or the issues she was running on. It’ s unclear how much they helped in convincing young people to vote for her , especially since much of that online momentum fizzled after the summer . At the same time, Harris, a careful career politician, has never used social media like Trump. She had plenty of A-list backing, even celebrity support from stars such as Beyonce and Lady Gaga, but that paled next to Musk’ s firehose of support. I think that traditional celebrity endorsement—with the exception of Taylor Swift—has less power over younger voters than a prominent influencer they love. When Democrats get over the rancor , it’s hard not to see both sides looking at the 2024 cycle as a playbook for how to use creators. I think we’ll see Democrats opt for creators and podcasters popular for their longer content as they have more sway over their followers and deeper parasocial relationships. 11/11/24, 7:57 PM Scotto Mail - Creator Economy: How Trump Used Influencers to Win Over Voters https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=4a105ce404&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1815014284144797412&simpl=msg-f:1815014284144797… 5/11","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
