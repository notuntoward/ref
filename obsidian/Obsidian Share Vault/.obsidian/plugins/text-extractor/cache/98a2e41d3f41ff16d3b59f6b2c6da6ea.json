Even though the product advertising literature has longrecognized that advertising has both “wear in” and “wear out” effects, few political communication scholars consider this possibility. This study explainswhy it is both normatively and empirically important to determine the precise relationship between advertising and vote choice. We then use data from twopublished studies to investigate inductively how persuasion effects vary with different television advertising levels. The findings suggest that politicaladvertisements do indeed have both “wear-in” and “wear-out” effects. We conclude by investigating three ways to model advertising effects in a more parsimoniousmanner and settle on log transforming the measure of advertising as the preferred method.
