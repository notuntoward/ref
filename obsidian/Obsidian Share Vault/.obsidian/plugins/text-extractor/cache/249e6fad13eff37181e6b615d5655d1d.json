However, granular information about political advertising on social media was previously unavailable, thus raising concerns regarding fairness, accountability, and transparency in the electoral process. In this article, we analyze targeted political advertising on social media via a unique, large-scale dataset of over 80,000 political ads from Meta during the 2021 German federal election, with more than 1.1 billion impressions. For each political ad, our dataset records granular information about targeting strategies, spending, and actual impressions. We then study (i) the prevalence of targeted ads across the political spectrum; (ii) the discrepancies between targeted and actual audiences due to algorithmic ad delivery; and (iii) which targeting strategies on social media attain a wide reach at low cost. We find that targeted ads are prevalent across the entire political spectrum. Moreover, there are considerable discrepancies between targeted and actual audiences, and systematic differences in the reach of political ads (in impressions-per-EUR) among parties, where the algorithm favor ads from populists over others. Keywords: targeted advertising, social media, algorithmic discrepancies, politics, election campaigns Significance Statement Social media platforms have become important tools for political campaigning worldwide. In our study of over 80,000 political ads from the 2021 German federal election, we reveal extensive use of targeted political advertising across the full political spectrum, sig- nificant discrepancies between targeted and actual audiences, and a systematic bias in the algorithmic delivery of ads favoring popu- list parties. These findings highlight the complex relationship between digital campaigning strategies and democratic processes, and caution about the potential for algorithmic biases to influence election campaigns. Overall, our work contributes to a better under- standing of targeted political advertising on social media and informs policymakers about the design of effective regulatory frame- works to promote fairness, accountability, and transparency.

Introduction With around 4.6 billion users globally (1), social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter/X have become import- ant tools for political campaigning worldwide (2). For example, in the United States, expenditure on online political advertising rose from USD ∼70 million in 2014 to USD ∼1.8 billion in 2018 (3). Similarly, politicians in Europe have recognized the importance of social media for their campaigns. For instance, the majority of candidates in the 2021 German federal election believed that social media can influence voters (4). An essential feature of advertising on social media is targeting, which allows advertisers to select specific user groups and deliver tailored political messages to particularly receptive audiences (2, 5–7). For example, campaigns can send tailored ads that align with the interests of distinct voter groups (8), thus ensuring that their content resonates with the unique political perspectives of each audience (9). However, targeting in political advertising is problematic (10–12). First, targeting is concerning if parties cater ads to specific groups (13) or send conflicting messages on political issues to different audiences (14). Second, targeted ads are distrib- uted by proprietary algorithms that are beyond societal scrutiny and that may exhibit biases that influences the audience of specif- ic ads (11, 15–17). Third, privacy concerns are eminent given that political targeting heavily depends on potentially sensitive PNAS Nexus, 2024, 00, pgae247 https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae247 Advance access publication 18 June 2024 Research ReportDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae247/7695718 by guest on 13 November 2024 information (e.g. ethnic origin, sexual orientation) to identify re- ceptive audiences (18–20). Essentially, the use of targeting raises concerns regarding fairness, accountability, and transparency in electoral processes. The concerns regarding democratic integrity have spurred calls to monitor political advertising on social media (21, 22). However, granular information about political ads (e.g. impression counts, price per ad) is in the hands of proprietary social media platforms and, so far, has been either unavailable or deemed imprecise (23, 24). This lack of transparency may prevent accountability for mis- conduct, which is particularly concerning given recent evidence suggesting that political advertising on social media directly af- fects voter turnout (25) and vote choice (26–28). As such, there is a growing need to monitor targeted political advertising on social media to safeguard democratic integrity. A combination of public pressure (3) and regulatory efforts (e.g. the Honest Ads Act in the United States (29) and the Digital Services Act in the E.U. (30)) have pushed social media platforms to strengthen their transparency efforts around political advertis- ing. Indeed, Meta has launched the Meta Ad Library, which pro- vides public access to all political and social ads published on Facebook and Instagram, and allows researchers to study political advertising at scale (31–35) (see Supplementary Material S1 for a comprehensive overview of the literature). However, existing ana- lyses had only limited access to political ads, since crucial infor- mation about targeting was missing. As such, it remains unclear how targeting is used, how targeted ads are distributed, what the different targeting strategies behind political ads are, and how their reach at a given budget varies. There are good reasons to believe that parties adopt diverse tar- geting strategies (8, 9, 36). Previous research on the content of on- line political ads has shown that parties pursue different communication strategies (32, 37). Some parties advertise by par- ticularly focusing on issues related to their base (32, 37) such as, for example, environmentalism in the case of the Grüne. In con- trast, other parties avoid ads related to specific political issues (9, 37) and tend to publish more “generic” ads, for example, intro- ducing a candidate or calling to vote. Since the latter does not refer to a concrete political issue, such ads may reach audiences across party boundaries, which may vary with respect to age, gender, and interests (32). As such, targeting may limit the political participa- tion of disadvantaged groups due to a party’s targeting strategy (differently from ads on broadcast media that can be received by all voter groups). Furthermore, there is reason to expect that the algorithmic delivery of social media ads may introduce further bias (15–17), thus resulting in differences between actual and in- tended audiences. For example, social media algorithms exhibit a tendency to target fewer women due to differences in advertising costs (17). Such algorithmic bias can lead to discrimination as wom- en may be less frequently exposed to political campaigns and thus harm political participation. Moreover, such bias can harm political competition when, for instance, some parties consistently pay higher prices for political ads, thus leading to fairness issues. In this article, we analyze targeted political advertising on social media using a large-scale dataset with N = 81,549 political ad contracts (henceforth simply ads) a from Meta during the 2021 German federal election (see Supplementary Material S2 for add- itional context on the election). Overall, these ads generated more than 1.1 billion impressions with an overall cost of EUR 9.8 million. Our dataset provides a unique view of the targeting strategies that parties use across the entire political spectrum, during an election with more than 60 million eligible voters. In particular, our dataset comprises granular information about each ad, including targeting strategies, spending, and actual impressions, and thus allows us to study targeted political advertising on social media. Our analysis is three-fold: (i) We assess the prevalence of tar- geted political ads across the full political spectrum and infer de- tailed targeting strategies used by political parties for their election campaigns. (ii) We evaluate discrepancies between tar- geted and actual audiences due to algorithmic bias in the ad deliv- ery and how such discrepancies vary across parties. (iii) We analyze the characteristics of targeted ads with far reach at a giv- en budget during elections and analyze whether parties are discri- minated by algorithmic ad delivery in that they pay a higher price per impression. Results Targeted political advertising during the 2021 German federal election We analyze targeted political ads on Meta during the 2021 German federal election (see Supplementary Material S2 for additional context on the election) and compare how parties across the political spectrum use targeting for their campaign purposes. Overall, we analyze N = 81,549 political ads that gen- erated more than 1.1 billion impressions with an overall cost of EUR 9.8 million. For a breakdown of our dataset in terms of to- tal number of ads, ad spending, and impressions by party, see Supplementary Material S3. The ads in our dataset are designed mostly to mobilize and persuade voters and tend to focus on parties more broadly rather than candidates. Details are in Supplementary Materials S4 and S5. Targeting has spurred concerns regarding political advertising on social media (12, 38). However, it is unclear to what extent par- ties use targeting during election campaigns. Throughout the art- icle, we consider an ad to employ “targeting” if it uses any targeting category available to advertisers on Meta in addition to demographics (i.e. gender and age) and location (since the latter must always be specified in the ad creation). For details, see Materials and methods section. To analyze the prevalence of targeted political ads on Meta dur- ing the 2021 German federal election, we start by quantifying the number of targeted ads. In the run-up to the election, 72.3 % of all ads used targeting, which corresponds to 72.6 % of the total ad spending on Meta during the election. This highlights the import- ance of targeted ads for political campaigns on social media. Meta allows advertisers to target users based on various target- ing categories (see Supplementary Material S8 for an overview). We expect that some targeting categories are more popular than others and thus study how the campaign budget is distributed be- tween categories. Figure 1 shows the top-10 targeting categories in terms of spending across all parties. We find that parties tend to use exclusion rather than inclusion criteria to target users. This result suggests that most parties rely on broad audiences and al- low Meta to optimize ad delivery among users. To define inclusion criteria, parties largely rely on so-called interests (e.g. social equality, environmentalism, and international relations), behav- iors (e.g. early adopters of new technology, commuters, inter- national travelers), or employers (e.g. business owners, police officers, Ford Deutschland). Parties also frequently define a specif- ic list of users to be targeted (“Custom”) or an audience that is similar to a previously defined target group (“Lookalike”). Lastly, parties commonly target users based on their location. For ex- ample, 88.72 % of the ads have a precise location targeting (beyond Germany). Overall, these results show that parties employ a wide 2 | PNAS Nexus, 2024, Vol. 00, No. 0Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae247/7695718 by guest on 13 November 2024 variety of targeting strategies. For a breakdown of the top-10 tar- geting criteria by party, see Supplementary Material S3. We now study the reach of political ads at a given budget. To do so, we focus on the number of impressions an ads generates per EUR spent (henceforth simply impressions-per-EUR). Political par- ties employ different campaign strategies on social media (37), which may also lead to differences in the impressions-per-EUR of political ads. We thus compare impressions-per-EUR across political parties and test for statistically significant differences us- ing a Kruskal–Wallis test (39). The results are in Fig. 2a and b. We find that impressions-per-EUR significantly differs across parties (P < 0.05). On average, political ads generate 126.71 impressions- per-EUR. However, the Grüne receives, on average, only 36.18 impressions-per-EUR. In contrast, ads published by the FDP and the AfD are considerably more efficient, reaching, on average, 181.53 and 203.49 impressions per EUR, respectively. In summary, impressions-per-EUR of social media ads varies greatly across the political spectrum. Given the high prevalence of targeted ads, we also compare impressions-per-EUR for targeted ads and ads without targeting. Our results are mixed (see Fig. 2c). While targeted ads achieve, on average, more impressions-per-EUR compared to ads without targeting for the Linke, FDP, and AfD, the opposite is true for the Grüne, SPD, and Union. Performing multiple pairwise Kruskal– Wallis tests with Benjamini–Hochberg correction based on a family-wise error rate (FWER) of FWER = 0.05, we find that these differences are all statistically significant (P < 0.05). Generally, tar- geting may result in less impressions-per-EUR than ads without targeting in terms of impressions per EUR. This may be due to more narrow and thus more expensive targeting, or to an audi- ence for which targeting is more expensive. Discrepancies between targeted and actual audiences Previous research has shown that algorithmic ad delivery can lead to discrepancies between intended and actual audiences on Meta (15, 16). This may be concerning if algorithmic ad delivery would propagate existing biases in voting patterns that restrict the reach of a party among a certain population, and thus hamper fair elect- oral competition. For example, some parties (e.g. Grüne) tend to re- ceive more votes from younger female audiences while others are more popular among older male audiences (e.g. AfD). We thus explore potential discrepancies between the demographic distri- bution of the intended (= targeted) and the actual audience reached by political campaigns due to the algorithmic ad delivery. Meta does not provide detailed information on the actual audi- ence with respect to other targeting criteria, which is why we fo- cus on age and gender. These demographic characteristics are nevertheless important determinants for a plethora of life out- comes and ideological stances (40). Let us first focus on age (Fig. 3). For each party, we compute the proportion of actual impressions generated by different age buck- ets, where we weight each ad by the amount of money spent. We refer to this vector as the actual audience of an ad. Similarly, we compute the proportion of targeted impressions by different age buckets, where we again weight each ad by the amount of money spent. This vector is the target audience of an ad. Figure 3a shows the discrepancy (percentage difference) between the actual and tar- get audience. All parties reach an actual audience that is younger than the one targeted, except for the far-right AfD which generally reaches an older audience. We also compute the Wasserstein dis- tance WS (see Supplementary Material for details) to quantify the difference (in years) between the age distribution of actual and tar- get audiences for all parties. It yields: Linke = 4.69, Gr ¨une = 6.35, SPD = 4.61, FDP = 5.18, Union = 5.69, and AfD = 4.89. Overall, the Linke and the SPD show the smallest discrepancy between the tar- geted and actual audience, while the Grüne exhibits the largest one. Figure 3b shows the values for actual and target for the AfD, thereby highlighting in red (green) the age buckets where the ac- tual audience is smaller (larger) than the targeted one. We repeat the procedure above to compute the variables for the actual and target audience of an ad by gender. For all parties, there is a large discrepancy between the targeted vs. actual audience in terms of gender, with ads shown to fewer female users than in- tended, except for the Grüne (see Fig. 3c). This is particularly pro- nounced for right-wing parties such as the Union and the AfD. For example, the AfD reaches 12.91% more male individuals than ori- ginally targeted. Interestingly, the Grüne is the only party for which the opposite is true: its ads reach 5 % more female individ- uals and 8 % fewer male individuals than targeted. To quantify the discrepancies in the gender distribution between actual and target audience, we again compute the Wasserstein distance for each Fig. 1. Top-10 targeting criteria by total spending.

Bär et al. | 3Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae247/7695718 by guest on 13 November 2024 party: Linke = 2.35, Gr ¨une = 6.55, SPD = 3.27, FDP = 7.81, Union = 7.95, and AfD = 13.35, which corroborate the previous observations. Systematic differences in impressions-per-EUR across parties Regression analysis To evaluate how key aspects of online political advertising are as- sociated with impressions-per-EUR, we perform a regression ana- lysis. For this, we estimate three separate linear regression models that focus on different determinants for impressions-per-EUR, namely, (i) targeting strategies, (ii) demographics, and (iii) ad characteristics (see Materials and methods for methodological details). 1. Targeting strategy: Our first regression model assesses how targeting strategies are related to impressions-per-EUR (see Fig. 4a). Ads that use more targeting criteria are linked to low- er impressions-per-EUR as indicated by the negative and stat- istically significant coefficients for “No. Include criteria” (P < 0.05) and “No. Exclude criteria” (P < 0.05). This link is par- ticularly strong for exclusions, where, all else equal, an add- itional 18.49 excluded criteria predicts a decrease of 68.37 impressions-per-EUR. Our regression results further show that targeting has a heterogeneous effect on impressions- per-EUR. For example, the usage of the targeting categories “Behaviors (Include)” and “Interests (Exclude)” is associated with considerably more impressions-per-EUR as indicated by a positive and significant coefficient (P < 0.05). In contrast, the negative and significant coefficient for “Employers (exclude)” and “Interests (include)” suggest that exclusion criteria for em- ployers or inclusion criteria for interests correspond to lower levels of impressions-per-EUR. Interestingly, excluding custom audiences is linked to higher ad efficiency, while excluding lookalike audiences is negatively associated with ad efficiency as shown by a positive and statistically significant coefficient for “Custom audience (exclude)” (P < 0.05) and a negative and statistically significant for “Lookalike (exclude)” (P < 0.05). Given that ad delivery heavily relies on Meta’s algorithm, more transparency would be crucial to explain these findings. 2. Demographic segments: Our second regression model evaluates how different demographics explain impressions-per-EUR. The regression results are in Fig. 4b. We find a positive and statistically significant coefficient for “Female” (P < 0.05) and “Male” (P < 0.05), suggesting that targeting only female or male audiences rather than all genders is associated with more impressions-per-EUR. All else equal, only targeting users from a single gender predicts, on average, an additional 43.90 (“Female only”) and 38.08 (“Male only”) impressions-per-EUR. Furthermore, the coefficients for Age: 18–24, Age: 25–34, and Age: 45–54 are positive and statistically significant (P < 0.05), while the coefficients for Age: 35–44, and Age: 65+ are negative a b c Fig. 3. a) Discrepancy in the age distribution between the actual and target audience (in %). We find that ads by most parties (except AfD) are seen by more users between 25 and 34 than originally intended. b) Comparison of actual and target audience by age for political ads published by AfD. A red color (i.e. proprotion of target audience is larger than actual audience) indicates areas where the difference between the actual and targeted audience is negative (green for positive, i.e. proportion of target audience smaller than actual audience). Younger and older users see the ads less often than originally intended by the party. c) Discrepancy in the gender distribution between the actual and target audience (in %). We find large differences between male and female audiences for right-wing parties (e.g. Union, AfD), implying that ads are seen by considerably fewer females than originally intended due to the algorithmic ad delivery. 4 | PNAS Nexus, 2024, Vol. 00, No. 0Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae247/7695718 by guest on 13 November 2024 and statistically significant (P < 0.05). As such, addressing younger audiences is linked to more impressions-per-EUR ex- cept for the age group between 35 and 44. 3. Ad characteristics: In our third regression model, we study how ad characteristics are linked to impressions-per-EUR (Fig. 4c). For example, the timing and content of an ad explain its impressions-per-EUR. In particular, ads that are online for a longer period and published earlier in the week tend to receive more impressions-per-EUR as indicated by the positive and statistically significant coefficient for Duration (P < 0.05) and Tuesday (P < 0.05) as well as the negative coefficients for the oth- er weekdays. As such, all else equal, for each extra week that an ad remains online our model predicts 24.98 additional impressions-per-EUR. When assessing the link between impressions-per-EUR and whether a candidate has published an ad, we do not find a statistically significant coefficient (P = 0.31). However, the party dummy is an important deter- minant of impressions-per-EUR. In particular, ads published by the AfD are linked to more impressions-per-EUR compared to all other parties, which is seen by the negative and statistic- ally significant coefficient for all other party variables (P < 0.01). All else equal, ads by the AfD reach +148.88, +99.86, +91.09, +81.97, and +21.25 additional impressions-per-EUR compared to the Grüne, SPD, Union, Linke, and FDP, respectively. Of note, sentiment, weekday, platform dummy, and party dummy are categorical variables. Hence, they need a reference condition to include them in our regression model. The coeffi- cients of these variables should be interpreted relative to the ref- erence categories. In this analysis, we chose “neutral” sentiment, “Monday”, “both platforms”, and “AfD” as reference categories. We further conducted two additional analyses, which are mo- tivated by the fact that larger competition may influence ad im- pressions. Generally, we expect competition among political ads to be small given that political ads represent only a small fraction out of all ads on Meta. Nevertheless, we perform two analyses where we control for the time-to-election-day and the number of competing political ads. We find that publishing ads earlier in the campaign is related to higher levels of impressions-per-EUR. Furthermore, higher competition in terms of more active ads at the publishing day is negatively related to impressions-per-EUR. Of note, all other results remain consistent with our main analysis except for the coefficient of negative sentiment, which is no longer statistically significant. Details are in Supplementary Material S6. a b c Fig. 4. Coefficient estimates and 95 % confidence intervals for a) targeting strategies, b) demographics, and c) ad characteristics.

Bär et al. | 5Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae247/7695718 by guest on 13 November 2024 Machine learning approach We now employ a machine learning approach to predict the reach of political ads for a given budget based on the information pro- vided by Meta. The rationale for this design is two-fold. (i) If the available information in the Meta Ad Library and the Meta Ad Targeting Dataset is sufficiently complete, we should be able to make accurate predictions of impressions-per-EUR given the available features. In other words, a low prediction performance suggests that other unobserved features explain the heterogen- eity in the reach of different ads for a given budget (e.g. factors re- lated to the algorithmic delivery of ads), but these features are not captured in the dataset and are thus not available for external stakeholders. Hence, this can provide a glimpse into the transpar- ency provided by the available data. (ii) The machine learning pre- dictions can also be used to examine empirically whether there are systematic differences between the predicted and actual reach of an ad for a given budget, across different political parties. In other words, if a party consistently receives more views for a given budget than others targeting the same audience, this could indicate that the algorithmic delivery of ads is advantaging said party, which would undermine fair competition. We fit a random forest model (41) by using all variables from our regression analysis related to key determinants of the reach of an ad for a given budget, namely, (1) targeting strategies (e.g. the type and frequency of targeting categories), (2) demographics (age, gender of target group), and (3) ad characteristics (e.g. senti- ment of an ad, ad duration, publishing party). In addition, we use the full set of targeting variables and add variables that indicate whether (i) the advertisers supplied a data file to include/exclude a custom audience and (ii) the data supplied by the advertisers to include/exclude a custom/lookalike audience was complete. For a full list of variables, see Materials and methods. To measure the reach of an ad for a given budget, we again rely on the number of impressions generated per EUR spent (i.e. impressions- per-EUR). Details on the implementation are in Materials and methods. Our model achieves an average root mean squared error RMSE = 123.79 over 10 runs (± a s.d. of 4.21) when predicting impressions-per-EUR on the hold-out set. More importantly, our model can only explain a fraction of the variance in our data (R 2 = 0.40 ± a s.d. of 0.02 over 10 runs). The low R2 suggests that the available information about targeting strategies, demograph- ics, and ad characteristics is not sufficient to fully characterize the impressions-per-EUR of the ad campaign. Next, we compute the mean difference between the predicted and actual impressions-per-EUR across parties. This measure in- dicates whether specific parties consistently achieve more or few- er impressions-per-EUR while controlling for all other available sources of heterogeneity in targeting strategies, demographics, and ad characteristics. Figure 5 shows that most left-leaning par- ties (i.e. the Grüne and the SPD, except for Linke) and Union consist- ently achieve fewer impressions-per-EUR than predicted by our model. In contrast, the FDP and AfD, on average, receive 12.83 and 2.81 additional impressions per EUR, respectively. This result implies a relative advantage of 10.13 and 2.22% in impressions- per-EUR compared to the average ad that achieves 126.71 impressions-per-EUR. Overall, our results suggest that the algo- rithmic delivery of political ads may advantage specific parties. We perform a series of checks to ensure the robustness of our results. First, we train an XGBoost model using the same training procedure as outlined for the random forest model. Second, we check the heterogeneity of our results across platforms and re-train our random forest model by using political ads that were solely published on (i) Facebook and (ii) Instagram. Across both checks, our main findings regarding (i) and (ii) remain con- sistent. Details are in Supplementary Material S10. Discussion Targeted political advertising on social media has raised signifi- cant concerns regarding fairness, accountability, and transpar- ency among researchers, policymakers, and society at large. Given the known and significant impact of political advertising on voter turnout and vote choice (25–28), it is crucial to analyze how parties across the political spectrum employ targeting during election campaigns and inform policymakers on the implications of targeted political advertising for democracies. Our findings contribute to the existing literature on political ad- vertising on social media by providing evidence of the prevalence of targeting across the political spectrum. While social media was found to be an essential communication channel for parties dur- ing election campaigns (9, 32, 37), it was previously unclear whether and how parties make use of targeting. Targeting was used in 72.3% of all ads published on Meta during the 2021 German federal election. In fact, parties rely on a wider range of targeting categories available to advertisers on Meta. For example, a majority of campaign budget is spent for ads that exclude users based on so-called interests (e.g. social equal- ity, environmentalism, and international relations), behaviors (e.g. early adopters of new technology, commuters, international travelers), or employers (e.g. business owners, police officers, Ford Deutschland). We further find significant differences in the reach of ads at a given budget. For example, the far-right AfD achieves significantly more impressions-per-EUR compared to other parties. Our results further show that the algorithms of the platforms drive—to a large extent—who views an ad, which can lead to dis- crepancies between the intended (targeted) and actual audience. Indeed, we find considerable discrepancies between both. For in- stance, the Grüne reaches considerably more female users than in- tended, while the Union and the AfD reach a larger male audience than intended. Algorithmic bias in the delivery of political ads may amplify stereotypes associated with vote choices among dis- tinct segments of the electorate. In fact, previous research has shown that algorithmic bias is responsible for systematically de- livering ads based on gender stereotypes, but in a job context (17). This aligns with the fact that the Grüne traditionally receives more support from female voters compared to both the Union and the AfD, which more strongly depend on male voters. The results of our regression analysis provides evidence for sig- nificant heterogeneity in the impressions-per-EUR of targeted ads. For example, ads targeting only a single gender achieve signifi- cantly more impressions-per-EUR. This may be due to a higher level of personalization but also raises concerns on whether algo- rithmic bias propagates gender-specific ads particularly well. Fig. 5. Average difference between actual vs. predicted impressions- per-EUR based on our machine learning model over 10 runs. 6 | PNAS Nexus, 2024, Vol. 00, No. 0Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae247/7695718 by guest on 13 November 2024 Moreover, ads by Grüne receive considerably fewer impressions- per-EUR than other parties. Given that their voters have an above-average income targeting them may be more costly than the average. In contrast, ads published by the AfD generate the most impressions-per-EUR. This could be explained by the fact that incendiary political issues promoted by populist parties (e.g. anti-immigration), tend to attract high attention on social media (32, 42, 43). Finally, the results of our machine learning approach show that detailed information on targeting strategies, demographics, and ad characteristics cannot fully explain the reach of an ad for a given budget in terms of impressions-per-EUR. This finding indicates that current transparency measures do not suffice to evaluate how proprietary algorithms deliver political ads. In fact, we find sys- tematic differences between predicted and actual impressions- per-EUR, which is particularly wide for the far-right AfD. This gap is concerning as it possibly indicates the presence of algorithmic biases that may favor populist ads. As with other research, ours is not free from limitations that offer opportunities for future work. We focus on the 2021 German federal election; extending our results to other countries is important for generalizability. Nevertheless, the federal struc- ture in Germany is similar to other countries, and the election is comparatively large, with more than 60 million eligible voters and candidates from parties across the political spectrum (44). Our analysis is based on a unique, large-scale dataset that is pro- prietary and, as such, offers granular insights. However, more re- search is needed to assess the accuracy of the Meta Ad Library (23). Furthermore, the effects of algorithmic ad delivery are not yet fully understood and may require further data disclosure by platforms. For instance, Meta only offers specific audience details related to age and gender, without providing comprehensive pri- cing information. This lack of data precludes a broader analysis of how pricing mechanisms vary and the discrepancies between the targeted and actual audiences. We thus encourage future re- search to focus on pricing mechanisms for political ads on social media and more granular analyses of actual and targeted audien- ces. Lastly, while our current focus is on targeting, we also provide insights on the purpose (see Supplementary Material S4) and fo- cus of ads (i.e. candidates vs. parties; see Supplementary Material S5). Here, interdisciplinary approaches combining com- putational methods and theory from political science (45) could expand our analysis on the communication strategies employed by various parties on social media beyond targeting. Our results contribute to the political science literature by shedding light on the prevalence of targeting during real-world elections. Targeting is highly prevalent in political campaigns and allows parties to focus on specific voter segments. This result mandates additional efforts by researchers to unravel the impact of targeted political advertising on society. Our results have further implications for parties and policy- makers. For parties, we provide valuable insights into the delivery mechanisms of targeted ads on social media. For policymakers, our research emphasizes the necessity to intensify auditing and regulation regarding political advertising on social media. The dis- crepancies between actual and targeted audiences that we identified potentially originate from algorithmic bias that favors certain voter segments. This is concerning as such bias may harm political partici- pation and reinforce discrimination against disadvantaged groups. Policymakers should pay particular attention to addressing these issues in regulatory frameworks and hold platforms ac- countable for ensuring fairness, accountability, and transparency in political advertising. For example, previous research (46) recommends that platforms make adaptations to the auction mechanisms to subsidize political advertisers or provide quotas in combination with separate auctions for political and commer- cial advertisers to lower competition for political advertisers. Policymakers could also require randomization of ad delivery among the target population as discussed by the European Parliament (47), thereby preventing discrimination due to algo- rithmic bias. Most importantly, policymakers should incentivize additional transparency measures. For example, current meas- ures are insufficient to evaluate how the platform’s pricing mech- anism influences ad delivery, limiting independent assessment by researchers. Mandatory disclosure of information about click rates could help to better understand the effectiveness of social media ads. Overall, there is a pressing need for policymakers to mandate such disclosures, allowing for third-party monitoring and contributing to a more accountable system of political adver- tising on social media. Materials and methods Data We collect N = 81,549 political ads from the 2021 German federal election published by candidates and parties (including their youth organizations) on Facebook and Instagram. Specifically, we first obtain all ads with a starting day in the period [2021 July 01, 2021 September 26] from the Meta Ad Library API (48). We then filter ads where the sponsor or page name matches any of the six major parties (i.e. Linke, Grüne, SPD, FDP, Union, and AfD) or one of their candidates running for office. b Of note, advertisers on Meta may purchase ads with the same creatives (i.e. content, image, etc.) multiple times. Therefore, we use the term “ad” to re- fer to a single ad contract, including its timing, budget, and target- ing settings besides its content. The Meta Ad Library API provides detailed information about content, page/sponsor name, money spent, start and stop dates, and the number of impressions distributed across gender and age (i.e. in buckets corresponding to 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65+ years). It also indicates whether an ad was published (a) only on Facebook, (b) only on Instagram, or (c) simultaneously on both platforms. For ad spending and the number of impres- sions, Meta only reports discretized buckets. Following previous research (9, 26, 31–34), we average the maximum and minimum of each bucket to obtain conservative point estimates of the ad spending and the number of impressions per ad. A full list of var- iables is available in Supplementary Material S7. We further use the Meta Ad Targeting Dataset (49) to access ad targeting information. The Meta Ad Targeting Dataset contains tar- geting information on all social issue, electoral, and political ads published after 2020 August 3, on Facebook or Instagram (49). The dataset can be accessed after approval by Meta via https:// developers.facebook.com/docs/ad-targeting-dataset. We ac- cessed the dataset in August 2023 and queried targeting informa- tion for all N = 81,549 political ads retrieved from the Meta Ad Library API based on the unique ad ids. In particular, we queried information about the users’ demographics (age and gender) tar- geted by each ad, as well as additional targeting categories such as interests, behaviors, jobs, or locations. Throughout the article, we consider an ad to employ “targeting” if it uses any category pro- vided in the dataset in addition to demographics (i.e. gender and age) and location (since the latter must always be specified in the ad creation). We further choose to ignore the “Include loca- tion” category, which is defined by default for every ad (e.g. Bär et al. | 7Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae247/7695718 by guest on 13 November 2024 “Germany”), but we do consider “Exclude location” (only present for a very small minority of ads = 3.35%). Targeting information for each ad is specified in groups of categories (e.g. “Interests” such as Politics and Environment), and the ad will include/exclude people that match at least one category in each group. We notice that the majority of the “include” conditions in our data contains 1–2 groups, while all “exclude” conditions contain a single group. For a comprehensive overview of the targeting information pro- vided in the dataset, see Supplementary Material S8. For an ex- ample ad with targeting information, see Fig. S4. Wasserstein distance Following Capozzi et al. (32), we compute the Wasserstein dis- tance WS to quantify discrepancies between the demographic dis- tribution (i.e. age and gender) of the Target and Actual audience of an ad. The WS distance, also known as the earth mover’s distance (EMD) or Kantorovich–Rubinstein distance, is a measure of the dissimilarity between two probability distributions. It quantifies the minimum cost required to transform one distribution into an- other, where the cost is determined by the amount of “mass” that needs to be moved from each point in one distribution to its corre- sponding point in the other distribution. We compute it using the scipy Python library, which is based on the following formula: l1(u, v)= ∫ +∞ −∞ |U − V|, where u and v are the two distributions to compare, and U and V the respective cumulative distribution functions. Regression analysis We hypothesize that targeting affects the impressions-per-EUR of political ads on social media. We thus use regression analysis to study what factors drive the reach of an ad at a given budget for political advertising on social media. To measure the reach of an ad, we rely on the number of impressions an ad generated per EUR spent (or simply impressions-per-EUR). Let yi denote impressions-per-EUR for an ad i, and let xi refer to a vector with different characteristics belonging to that ad. We then estimate the following linear regression model yi = α + βTxi, (1) where α represents the model intercept, and β measures the asso- ciations between the variables in xi and yi. For estimation, we use ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and test whether the coef- ficients are significantly different from zero using two-sided t-tests. To facilitate the interpretability of our results, we further z-standardize all numerical variables in x. Hence, we interpret our coefficients as follows: For numerical variables, a one stand- ard deviation increase in x predicts an increase in the reach of an ad at a given budget by β impressions-per-EUR. For dummy var- iables, a dummy variable in x set to one predicts an increase in the reach of an ad at a given budget by β impressions-per-EUR. We use three different regression models to analyze how impressions-per-EUR varies across ads. To do so, we use a com- prehensive set of variables available to us in the Meta Ad Library or the Meta Ad Targeting Dataset that represent three key deter- minants of impressions-per-EUR. In particular, we focus on (i) dif- ferent targeting strategies, (ii) different demographics, and (iii) different ad characteristics. We estimate separate models for each of these dimensions to avoid multicollinearity (50) and facili- tate interpretability. Targeting strategy: To assess the role of targeting strategies as a de- terminant of impressions-per-EUR, we compute two variables that correspond to the overall number of inclusion and exclu- sion criteria. The hypothesis is that more granular targeting may incur higher costs. Further, we consider which targeting categories have been used by a party. Here, we include two var- iables for each targeting category available to advertisers on Meta that indicate whether a certain category was used (=1 if the category was used, and =0 otherwise) to distribute an ad. The first (second) variable indicates whether users should be included (excluded) from the audience based on the corre- sponding targeting category. Table S3 lists all targeting cat- egories available to advertisers on Meta. Targeting categories are often employed together. To improve interpretaiblity and mitigate multicollinearity concerns, we thus focus on the top-10 targeting categories (by total spending). The top-10 tar- geting categories (by total spending) are shown in Fig. S1. Demographics: To study which demographics are linked to higher impressions-per-EUR, we include whether an ad is targeting only users from a single gender (i.e. only female or male users; =1 if yes, and =0 otherwise) as well as the share of tar- geted users across different age groups (i.e. 18–24, 25–34, 35– 44, 45–54, 55–64, 65+). Ad characteristics: Ad characteristics are likely to influence the reach of political ads at a given budget. Hence, we study how (i) content, (ii) timing, (iii) the platform an ad was pub- lished on, and (iv) the publisher of an ad is linked to impressions-per-EUR. (i) Content: We thus analyze the senti- ment conveyed by an ad and classify the content of each ad as “positive”, “neutral”, or “negative”. We use German Sentiment Bert, a state-of-the-art transformer-based senti- ment model for German text that was trained on 5.4 million labeled samples (51). (ii) Timing: We analyze whether launch- ing an ad on specific weekdays is beneficial and how ad dur- ation (i.e. the timespan an ad remains online) relates to impressions-per-EUR. (iii) Platform: Platform characteristics such as audience, user behavior, and ad competition can in- fluence political campaigning (52). Hence, we study the asso- ciation between impressions-per-EUR and the platform on which an ad was published, by using dummy variables to en- code whether an ad was published on Facebook, Instagram, or both platforms simultaneously. (iv) Publisher: In the context of the German dual-vote system, which features both party and candidate votes, political science literature shows the role of both party and candidate behavior in shaping voter per- ceptions (53). These perceptions may affect the impressions- per-EUR of ads authored by different party and candidate pages. Thus, we encode the different parties using dummy var- iables. We further encode whether the ad was distributed through a candidate’s page (=1 if yes, and =0 otherwise). Sentiment, weekday, platform dummy, and party dummy are multilevel categorical variables. Hence, we have to choose a ref- erence condition to include them in our regression model and in- terpret the coefficients relative to the reference categories. In analysis, we choose “neutral” sentiment, “Monday”, “both plat- forms”, and “AfD” as reference categories. Machine learning approach Objective: We employ a machine learning approach to evaluate whether we can predict the reach of an ad for a given budget as measured by impressions-per-EUR. The aim is two-fold. (i) We study whether a machine learning model can accurately predict 8 | PNAS Nexus, 2024, Vol. 00, No. 0Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae247/7695718 by guest on 13 November 2024 impressions-per-EUR of ads based on the information provided in the Meta Ad Library and Meta Ad Targeting Dataset. A high predic- tion performance implies that the provided information is sufficient to understand the ad delivery mechanisms of the platforms. Vice versa, a low prediction performance suggests the presence of unob- served confounders that explain the observed heterogeneity but which are currently unavailable for external audits. (ii) We analyze the difference between predicted and actual impressions-per- EUR across parties. In a fair environment, we would expect no systematic differences in terms of impressions-per-EUR between dif- ferent parties. In contrast, if a party consistently receives more views at a given budget than others targeting the same audience, this could indicate that the algorithmic delivery of ads is advantaging said party, which would undermine fair competition. Features: For our machine learning model, we use all variables from our regression model that represent key determinants of impressions-per-EUR: (i) different targeting strategies, (ii) differ- ent demographics, and (iii) different ad characteristics (see above). In addition, we use the full set of targeting variables (see Table S3 for a full list) and add variables that indicate whether (i) the advertisers supplied a data file to include/exclude a custom audience (=1 if the data file was supplied, and =0 otherwise) and (ii) the data supplied by the advertisers to include/exclude a cus- tom/lookalike audience was complete (=1 if the data were com- plete, and = 0 otherwise). Implementation: We (i) study whether machine learning can accurately predict impressions-per-EUR based on the above vari- ables and (ii) analyze the difference between predicted and actual impressions-per-EUR. To do so, we fit a random forest model (41) by using all features from above. We split our data into a training (80%) and a hold-out set (20%) for evaluation, and tune the model via 10-fold cross-validation in combination with a grid search (see below). To control for the number of ads published by each party, we weigh observations inverse proportionally to the ad frequency by party in our training set when fitting the model. We further z-standardize numeric variables. Hyperparameter tuning: For the training of the random forest model, we use 10-fold cross-validation in combination with a grid search. In particular, we vary (i) the number of trees used for a for- est (N estimators), (ii) the number of variables to consider at each split (Max features), (iii) maximum depth of the tree (Max depth), (iv) minimum samples to split a node (Min node), (v) minimum samples in a leaf (Min leaf), and (vi) whether to bootstrap samples when building trees (Bootstrap). Details on the hyperparameter tuning are in Supplementary Material S9. Evaluation: We evaluate the predictive power of our model based on the average root mean squared error (RMSE) over 10 runs with different seeds. We further rely on the R2 to determine how well our set of variables is able to explain variance in impressions-per-EUR. We compute the R 2 via R 2 = 􏽐n i=1 (yi − ̅y)(xi − ̅x) ���������������� 􏽐n i=1 (yi − ̅y)2 􏽱 ���������������� 􏽐n i=1 (xi − ̅x)2 􏽱 , (2) where n is the number of observations, with xi referring to a vector with different ad characteristics and yi representing predicted impressions-per-EUR, and ̅y and ̅x as their respective means. In a fully transparent setting, we would expect the R2 to be close to 1. Notes a Advertisers on Meta may purchase ads with the same creatives (i.e. content, image, etc.) multiple times. Therefore, we use “ad” to refer to the specific ad contract, including its timing, budget, and target- ing settings besides its creative parts. b For detailed election results, see www.bundeswahlleiterin.de/en/ bundestagswahlen/2021/ergebnisse.html.
