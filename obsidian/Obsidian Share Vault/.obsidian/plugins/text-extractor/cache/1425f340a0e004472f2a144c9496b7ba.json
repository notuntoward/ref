Every three years Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections (SDCI) staff start the code update process with a review of the changes made by the National Fire Protection Association in the latest edition of the National Electrical Code (NEC). They also review Washington Administrative Code (WAC) changes affecting electrical work and installations. This information is used to develop code changes designed to improve Seattle’s code. The public and various stakeholders are asked to submit and comment on proposed changes. A committee appointed by the City’s Construction Codes Advisory Board (CCAB) reviews these proposed changes. The committee includes electrical engineers, electrical contractors, and other professionals. Based on their feedback, we develop a draft ordinance of code changes. The draft ordinance is presented to the City’s Construction Codes Advisory Board (CCAB). The Board includes construction and design professionals who advise us about the impact of code changes on building safety, sustainability, and accessibility. We finalize code changes based on their recommendations. The ordinance is then reviewed and approved by the Seattle City Council. We are grateful to volunteers and City staff members who helped create the 2020 SEC. The result of their combined efforts is a code that improves the safety of electrical equipment and installations for everyone who visits, lives, or works in Seattle: Electrical Code Review Committee Charles E. Beck, Georginna Lucas, Haley Krommenhoek, Tony Penna, Warren Shill, Brian Kemly, Niels Fallisgaard, Joe Tremblay, JP Wittman SDCI Electrical Program Staff Tim Rasmussen, John Saldana, Scott Lau, Pat Foss, Ben Scott, Joe Kraft, Carol Kenefick City Attorney’s Office (Legislative Editors) Brandon Isleib and Phil Wood-Smith Technical Codes Program Staff Jenifer Gilliland iv Frequently Asked Questions What is this document? This document contains sections of the 2020 National Electrical Code (NEC) that have been modified in some way by The City of Seattle. It also includes changes made by the State of Washington to the NEC found in the Washington Administrative Code. This document is not the entire Seattle Electrical Code. Together, the 2020 NEC and the changes included in this quick reference guide make up the full 2020 Seattle Electrical Code. You can purchase a copy of the 2020 National Electrical Code from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) by following this link: https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes- and-standards/detail?code=70 What are informational notes? This document includes “informational notes” that refer to rules adopted by the state of Washington, which are known as Washington Administrative Code (WAC) rules. Some WAC rules are included “word-for-word” in this document, while others have been edited. If a 2020 SEC requirement is different than what the WAC requires, which one do I follow? You must comply with the Seattle requirements found in this document. What do the notations in the 2020 NEC and the Seattle quick reference pages mean? Shaded text Gray shading shows substantive changes, not just the correction of “typos” made by NFPA to the National Electrical Code. A figure caption with gray shading changes an existing figure. Underlined text Text added by The City of Seattle to the 2020 SEC. ((struck text)) Text eliminated by The City of Seattle and not enforced by the City. N New sections, tables, and figures (bold, italic N in a gray box to the left of the new material). An N next to an article title indicates that the entire article is new. Δ A new change made by NFPA within a section or subsection of the 2020 NEC. • When one of more paragraphs have been eliminated in the 2020 edition of the NEC, the deletion is indicated by a bullet (•) between the remaining paragraphs. v What’s New? Every three years, the Seattle City Council approves changes to the requirements of the National Electrical Code (NEC) needed to adapt the code for use in Seattle. The NEC, with local changes, make up the Seattle Electrical Code (SEC). These local changes are generally carried forward into the next SEC edition. Many changes correct editorial and grammatical mistakes or bring clarity to existing code language. However, Seattle does adopt amendments every three years to respond to unique Seattle concerns. The following are highlights of changes made by Seattle during the adoption of the 2020 Seattle Electrical Code: Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Articles 220.57 and 625.27 are modified to align EV charging infrastructure requirements with the Land Use Code. Calculated Electric Load Article 220.84 is modified to prevent calculated excess service capacity when using advanced heat pump systems. Construction Documents Article 80.51(B) increases sizes of services and systems before the submittal of construction documents is required.  The requirement trigging the need to submit construction documents for temporary services increased from 400 to 600 amperes. Temporary services under 600 amps can be processed using the over-the-counter process.  It is clarified that permanent services or feeders of 400 amperes or over require the submittal of construction plans.  The requirement triggering the need to submit construction plans for photovoltaic and other renewable energy systems is increased from 7.7 kW to 12 kW. A one line drawing and manufacturer’s installation requirements to the field inspector prior to the first cover inspection is required for systems rated 12kW and under. vi Electrical Code Review and Inspection Program What do we do? Our mission is to safeguard people and property from the hazards of electricity used in buildings and structures. Our inspectors review and inspect new electrical equipment and wiring installations for compliance with the requirements of the 2020 Seattle Electrical Code.

(D) Civil Actions and Penalties. (1) Civil Penalties. Any person found violating or failing to comply with the provisions of this Code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the authority having jurisdiction has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation. (2) Enforcement in Municipal Court. Civil actions to enforce this chapter shall be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court, except as otherwise required by law or court rule. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of a notice of violation or of an order following a review by the authority having jurisdiction is not itself evidence that a violation exists. (3) Judicial Review. Because civil actions to enforce this Code must be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court pursuant to Subsection 80.13(D)(2), orders of the authority having jurisdiction, including notices of violation issued under this chapter, are not subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 36.70C RCW. (4) Appeal to Superior Court. Final decisions of the Seattle Municipal Court on enforcement actions authorized by Title 22 and this Code may be appealed pursuant to the Rules for Appeal of Decisions of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction.

Informational Note No. 2: Battery equipment suppliers can provide information about available fault current on any particular battery model. 2020 Seattle Electrical Code Quick Reference 2020 SEATTLE ELECTRICAL CODE 138 For ESS disconnecting means where the line and load terminals may be energized in the open position, the device shall be marked with the following words or equivalent: WARNING ELECTRIC SHOCK HAZARD TERMINALS ON THE LINE AND LOAD SIDES MAY BE ENERGIZED IN THE OPEN POSITION The notification(s) and marking(s) shall comply with 110.21(B). ∆ (D) Partitions Between Components. Where circuits from the input or output terminals of energy storage components in an ESS pass through a wall, floor, or ceiling, a readily accessible disconnecting means shall be provided within sight of the energy storage component. Fused disconnecting means or circuit breakers shall be permitted to be used. 2020 Seattle Electrical Code Quick Reference 2020 SEATTLE ELECTRICAL CODE 139 ARTICLE 708 Critical Operations Power Systems (COPS) 708.54 Selective Coordination. Critical operations power system(s) overcurrent devices shall be selectively coordinated with all supply-side overcurrent protective devices. Selective coordination shall be selected by a licensed professional engineer or other qualified persons engaged primarily in the design, installation, or maintenance of electrical systems. The selection shall be documented and made available to those authorized to design, install, inspect, maintain, and operate the system. Exception No. 1: Selective coordination shall not be required between two overcurrent devices located in series if no loads are connected in parallel with the downstream device. Exception No. 2: When an electrical engineer provides stamped fault current calculations, the overcurrent protective devices in each disconnecting means may be selectively coordinated with any other supply side overcurrent protective devices for faults with a duration of 0.1 seconds and longer. Informational Note: See Informational Note Figure 708.54 for an example of how critical operations power system overcurrent protective devices (OCPDs) selectively coordinate with all supply-side OCPDs. OCPD D selectively coordinates with OCPDs C, F, E, B, and A. OCPD C selectively coordinates with OCPDs F, E, B, and A. OCPD F selectively coordinates with OCPD E. OCPD B is not required to selectively coordinate with OCPD A because OCPD B is not a critical operations power system OCPD. 2020 Seattle Electrical Code Quick Reference 2020 SEATTLE ELECTRICAL CODE 140 ARTICLE 710 Stand-Alone Systems 710.15 General. Premises wiring systems shall be adequate to meet the requirements of this Code for similar installations supplied by a feeder or service. The wiring on the supply side of the building or structure disconnecting means shall comply with the requirements of this Code, except as modified by 710.15(A) through (G). (A) Supply Output. Power supply to premises wiring systems fed by stand-alone or isolated microgrid power sources shall be permitted to have less capacity than the calculated load. The capacity of the sum of all sources of the stand- alone supply shall be equal to or greater than the load posed by the largest single utilization equipment connected to the system. Calculated general lighting loads shall not be considered as a single load. Informational Note: For general-use loads the system capacity can be calculated using the sum of the capacity of the firm sources, such as generators and ESS inverters. For specialty loads intended to be powered directly from a variable source, the capacity can be calculated using the sum of the variable sources, such as PV or wind inverters, or the combined capacity of both firm and variable sources. (B) Sizing and Protection. The circuit conductors between a stand-alone source and a building or structure disconnecting means shall be sized based on the sum of the output ratings of the stand-alone source(s). For three- phase interconnections, the phase loads shall be controlled or balanced to be compatible with specifications of the sum of the power supply capacities. (C) Single 120-Volt Supply. Stand-alone and isolated microgrid systems shall be permitted to supply 120 volts to single-phase, 3-wire, 120/240-volt service equipment or distribution panels where there are no 240-volt outlets and where there are no multiwire branch circuits. In all installations, the sum of the ratings of the power sources shall be less than the rating of the neutral bus in the service equipment. This equipment shall be marked with the following words or equivalent: WARNING: SINGLE 120-VOLT SUPPLY. DO NOT CONNECT MULTIWIRE BRANCH CIRCUITS! The warning sign(s) or label(s) shall comply with 110.21(B). N(D) Three-Phase Supply. Stand-alone and micro-grid systems shall be permitted to supply three-phase, 3-wire grounded or 4-wire grounded systems. (E) Energy Storage or Backup Power System Requirements. Energy storage or backup power supplies shall not be required. (F) Back-fed Circuit Breakers. Plug-in-type back-fed circuit breakers connected to an interconnected supply shall be secured in accordance with 408.36(D). Circuit breakers marked “line” and “load” shall not be backfed. (G) Voltage and Frequency Control. The stand-alone or isolated microgrid supply shall be controlled so that voltage and frequency remain within suitable limits for the connected loads. 2020 Seattle Electrical Code Quick Reference 2020 SEATTLE ELECTRICAL CODE 141 ARTICLE 760 Fire Alarm Systems 760.30 Fire Alarm Circuit Identification. Fire alarm circuits shall be identified at terminal and junction locations in a manner that helps to prevent unintentional signals on fire alarm system circuit(s) during testing and servicing of other systems. Device and junction boxes for fire alarm systems, other than the surface raceway type, must be substantially red in color, both inside and outside. Power-limited fire protective signaling circuit conductors must be durably and plainly marked in or on junction boxes or other enclosures to indicate that it is a power-limited fire protective signaling circuit. Informational Note: WAC 296-46B-760, requirements for fire alarm device and junction box identification, is incorporated herein.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
