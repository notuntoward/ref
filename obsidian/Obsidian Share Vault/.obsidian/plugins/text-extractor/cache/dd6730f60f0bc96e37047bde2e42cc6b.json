This change to a sustainable energy supply does not only imply the introduction of the renewable energy technologies but also will have important consequences for the organization, structure and manage- ment of all levels of electricity supply systems. Solar and wind generated power shows fundamentally different generation characteristics than power from conventional energy sources, like, for example fossil fuels. While power production of the latter may be adapted to the given electricity demand, the availability of solar and wind energy is largely determined by the prevailing weather conditions and therefore highly variable. These different characteristics pose a major challenge for the integration of renewable energies into the energy supply system and make new methods of balancing supply and demand necessary. Today, this task is mainly addressed by adapting the schedule of conventional, ﬂexible power plants in order to compensate ﬂuctuations in renewable power production. Electricity demand can be predicted with high accuracy. When ﬂuctuating renewable energies are integrated to the grid, the load proﬁles are modiﬁed, given that all power is directly integrated into the grid as it is the case, for example in Germany. Forecasts of solar and wind power are necessary to adjust the respective load forecasts. The required forecast horizon is partly deﬁned by technical constraints, for example the mix of power plants PROGRESS IN PHOTOVOLTAICS: RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS Prog. Photovolt: Res. Appl. 2011; 19:757–771 Published online 9 September 2010 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com). DOI: 10.1002/pip.1033 Copyright \u0001 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 757 with their speciﬁc start-up times. Even more important is its dependence on the organizational framework of the energy market. A major fraction of electric power transactions is realized on the so-called day-ahead market. Power purchase and sale bids for the next day have to be placed at a certain time, usually around noon, announcing supply or request of electric power in dependence on the daytime. Therefore, day- ahead power predictions are of particular relevance for grid integration purposes. Additionally, energy markets offer the possibility of intra-day trading. This allows for an adaption of the day-ahead schedule to updates of the forecasts for the respective day, which are expected to be more accurate than day-ahead forecasts. Remaining devi- ations between scheduled and needed power may be adjusted by using balancing energy and reserve power on the very short term scale. However, this is costly and reduces the value of the produced energy. Summarising, a major aim of PV power forecasts is to increase the value of the produced energy in the market. The need for forecast information on the expected solar and wind power production is increasing with the amount of installed power. Today, wind power prediction systems are already an essential part of the grid and system control in countries with a substantial wind power generation (see, e.g. Ref. [1]). Accordingly, the prediction of solar yields is getting more and more important, especially for countries where legislation encourages the deployment of solar power plants. In Germany about 9 GW of PV power were installed at the end of 2009. A share of 1% of the total electricity supply is covered by PV power production. For the control area of the German transmission system operator ‘trans- power Stromu¨bertragungs GmbH’ (‘transpower’) solar energy can contribute with up to 15% to the electricity demand during peak load hours on sunny summer days, as illustrated in Figure 1. The ﬁgure also shows a good correlation of load and PV power on sunny days. PV power especially contributes for hours with high demand and correspondingly high value of energy. As a consequence of this new and rapidly evolving situation on the energy market PV power prediction services are now requested, for example by transmission system operators and various PV power prediction schemes have been introduced recently [2–7]. Forecasting of global horizontal irradiance is the ﬁrst and most essential step in most PV power prediction systems. Therefore, increasing effort is currently spent on research on forecasting of solar irradiance as a basis for corresponding power forecasts. Depending on the forecast horizon different input data and forecasting models are appropriate. Time series models with on-site measured irradiance or power data as input are adequate for the very short-term time scale ranging from minutes up to few hours (see, e.g. Ref. [8]). Forecasts based on cloud motion vectors from satellite images (e.g. Ref. [9]) show a good performance for a temporal range of 30 min to 6 h. For forecast horizons from about 6 h onwards, forecasts based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) models typically out-perform the satellite based forecasts [10,11]. Hence, power prediction systems in the context of PV grid integration are based on this approach. Starting from initial conditions that are derived from worldwide observations, in a ﬁrst step, the future state of the atmosphere is calculated with a global NWP model, as, for example the Global Forecast System (GFS) run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Integrated Forecasts System (IFS) operated at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Global models usually have a coarse resolution and do not allow for a detailed mapping of small-scale features. Different concepts may be applied to account for local effects and to derive improved site-speciﬁc irradiance forecasts. One possibility is the downscaling by mesoscale models, as proposed, for example in Refs. [4,11,12]. Also different statistical or physical post-processing methods may be used to model local effects and to improve global model forecasts (e.g. Refs. [2,13–15]). Comparisons of different NWP based irradiance forecasting approaches are given in Refs. [16,17]. Different concepts are applied to derive PV power predictions from irradiance predictions and other NWP forecast parameters. Physical approaches explicitly model the different processes determining the conversion of solar irradiance to electricity (e.g. Refs. [2–4]). Statistical or learning approaches do not model the physical processes directly but establish the relation between power output and irradiance forecasts on the basis of historic data sets (e.g. Ref. [5]). Combined or hybrid approaches apply physical models in a ﬁrst step and correct the obtained results with a statistical model (e.g. Refs. [7,18]). Here, we present the regional PV power prediction system of University of Oldenburg and Meteocontrol GmbH, which is operationally employed by transmission system operators in Germany. The proposed approach to Figure 1. Feed-in of wind and PV power for 1 week in summer 2009 for the control area of the German transmission system operator ‘transpower’.

DOI: 10.1002/pip Regional PV power prediction E. Lorenz et al. predict regional PV power is based on forecasts of the ECMWF. The power prediction system has been developed on the basis of previous studies given in the Refs. [3,11,15,18]. Power predictions are derived from reﬁned irradiance forecasts [15] with a explicit physical model- ling, including conversion of horizontal irradiance to the array plane in a ﬁrst step and PV simulation in a second step. Finally, regional forecasts are calculated by up- scaling the power production from a representative set of PV systems. A special feature of the service is the possibility to access measured data of more than 8000 PV systems currently monitored by Meteocontrol GmbH in Germany. These data provide the basis for continuous evaluation and further development of the power prediction system, which is important to ensure the quality of the service. The approach for PV power forecasting is evaluated for the control areas of the German transmission system operators ‘50 Hertz Transmission GmbH’ (‘50 Hertz’) and ‘trans- power’ for the period 1.7.2009 to 30.4.2010. Apart from assessing the accuracy of the operational forecasting system, a special focus here is on the identiﬁcation of potential for further improvement in a detailed error analysis. In the next section, we introduce the basic models to derive the power forecasts. This is followed by a presentation of the up-scaling approach applied to obtain the regional forecasts. Section 4 describes the procedure of evaluation, and ﬁnally we present and discuss the evaluation results. 2. MODELS FOR PV POWER PREDICTION 2.1. Overview on PV power prediction scheme The prediction of the PV power production is based on irradiance and temperature forecasts of the ECMWF global model up to 3 days ahead. Power forecasts are ﬁrst derived for a representative set of PV systems and then scaled up to regional forecasts. Figure 2 illustrates the basic steps to calculate the power forecasts. For each step, the used models and necessary additional data and information on the PV systems are speciﬁed. In a ﬁrst step, site-speciﬁc hourly forecasts are derived from the low-resolution ECWMF forecasts for the representative system sites, involving a post- processing procedure using measured irradiance data. In a second step, the forecasts of the global horizontal irradiance are converted to the module plane with a tilted irradiance model, followed by the application of a PV simulation model to compute the power forecasts. The implementation of a second statistical post-processing based on measured power data to further improve the power predictions is currently under development. Finally, the regional forecasts are obtained by up-scaling of the power production from the representative set of PV systems. 2.2. Solar irradiance forecasting The solar irradiance forecasts used in the presented PV power prediction scheme are based on ECMWF global model irradiance forecasts up to 3 days ahead. Forecasts of the global model run are provided by the ECMWF with a temporal resolution of 3 h. The spatial resolution of the used forecasts has been kept to 0.258 \u0001 0.258, though a recent increase of the horizontal resolution in the ECMWF global model would allow retrieving forecasts with a higher resolution of 0.1258 \u0001 0.1258 since January 26th, 2010. The radiation package of the current ECMWF model implementation is described in Morcrette et al. [19]. We have investigated different post-processing tech- niques to reﬁne the ECMWF global model irradiance forecasts in order to obtain optimised hourly, site-speciﬁc irradiance forecasts [15]. In the following, we give a short description of the operationally implemented version. In a ﬁrst step, a spatial averaging procedure is applied. An analysis of the forecast accuracy in dependence on the area of averaging revealed that best results are achieved with a region of approximately 100 km \u0001 100 km. The beneﬁt of averaging is explained, for example in Ref. [15]. With respect to temporal interpolation an optimum adjustment to the required hourly resolution is achieved by combining the forecast data with a model for the calculation of irradiances for cloudless skies (clear sky model) in order to consider the typical diurnal course of irradiance. In our calculations we use the clear sky model proposed by Dumortier [20]. The temporal interpolation is performed for the clear sky index k\u0002, characterising the transmission of irradiance through clouds and deﬁned as the ratio of the global irradiance Iglob to the modelled irradiance for clear sky conditions Iclear. Finally, a bias-correction in dependence on the predicted cloud situation is applied. The original forecasts show a considerable overestimation of the irradiance for inter- mediate cloud cover. To avoid these systematic deviations, the bias (see also Section 4.1) is modelled as a polynomial function in dependence of the predicted clear sky index k\u0002 and the solar zenith angle uZ. The corrected forecasts then are obtained by subtracting the modelled bias(k\u0002, uZ) from the originally predicted values. Training of the ﬁt function is performed with a sliding window technique using measurements of the previous 30 days of weather stations in the region of interest. In Germany, irradiance data of more than 200 meteorological stations is available as a basis for this bias correction, partly operated by the German weather service DWD and partly operated by Meteomedia GmbH. For regional forecasts a signiﬁcant improvement is achieved by the described post-processing procedure in comparison to simple linear interpolation of the predicted irradiance values. For the site-speciﬁc forecasts the improvement is only small, because forecast errors are mainly determined by the scattering of errors around the mean value – that is, whether the occurrence of clouds is predicted correctly for this particular location for the Prog.

Lorenz et al. respective hours – rather than by systematic deviations. But for regional forecasts small-scale ﬂuctuations are strongly reduced by averaging effects and therefore the correction of systematic deviations has a remarkable effect. A comparison of the described procedure to other irradiance forecasting algorithms for different climatic regions in Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Spain) is reported in Ref. [17]. The different methods include the use of mesoscale NWP models, the application of various statistical post-processing tools to NWP forecasts, and also one approach involving meteorologists’ expert knowledge to interpret and combine forecast data of different sources. The approaches based on global NWP models in combination with post-processing showed best results as well in Central Europe as in Spain, with highest accuracies for the ECMWF based approach described here. 2.3. PV simulation The majority of PV systems receives the incoming irradiance on a tilted plane. Hence, the forecasted horizontal global irradiance has to be converted according to the orientation and declination of the modules to model the irradiance actually utilized by the PV system. Here, we use the tilted irradiance model formulated in Perez et al. [21] that includes anisotropic effects like horizon bright- ening and circumsolar irradiance. In the current version of the forecasting scheme the representative set of PV systems consists of converters with a ﬁxed tilt angle. So far tracking systems are not considered. In order to derive the power forecasts a robust simulation model for maximum power point (MPP) performance presented in Beyer et al. [22] is applied. A basic advantage of this general model to derive direct current (DC) output is the applicability to both classic crystalline silicon and various thin ﬁlm technologies. This meets the requirements for regional PV power forecasting, where a variety of different module types has to be considered. The simulation model estimates the efﬁciency hMPP of PV generators operated in MPP conditions in dependence on the tilted irradiance It and the module temperature Tm. In a ﬁrst step, the basic inﬂuence of the irradiance for Tm ¼ 258C is described with a parametric model, based on the analysis of the characteristics of different module types and suggestions in Ref. [23]: hMPPðIt; 25\u0003CÞ¼ a1 þ a2It þ a3 lnðItÞ (1) with a1, a2, and a3 being device speciﬁc parameters. The part load behaviour of modules depends on the cell type. A typical efﬁciency curve for a polycrystalline silicon module at Tm ¼ 258C with decreasing performance for low irradiances is given by the black curve in Figure 3. The curve is normalized to the efﬁciency at standard test conditions hSTC, where standard test conditions (STC) are deﬁned by Tm ¼ 258C, I ¼ 1000 W/m2 and the standard spectrum of air mass AM1.5. Other module types show different part load behaviour. In particular some thin-ﬁlm technologies have better efﬁciencies for low irradiance values than crystalline silicon cells. The model parameters a1, a2, a3 may be determined from manufacturers’ module data sheet information or from measured data. The performance at module operating temperatures Tm differing from 258C is modelled by the standard approach using a single temperature coefﬁcient a: hMPPðIt; TmÞ¼ hMPPðIt; 25 \u0003CÞð1 þ aðTm\u000425 \u0003CÞÞ: (2) Typical data sheet values for the temperature coefﬁcient are a ¼\u00040.0025/8C for Cadmium Telluride (CdTe), a ¼\u00040.003/8C for Cadmium Indium Diselenide (CIS) and a ¼\u00040.0035/8C for crystalline Silicon (cSi). Necessary information on the module temperature may be estimated from the ambient temperature and an additional term describing the heating of the module in dependence on the irradiance received by the module: Tm ¼ Ta þ gIt: (3) The parameter g is determined by the mounting type of the system. For example, roof integrated systems (g ¼ 0.0568Cm2/W) generally heat up faster than free- standing installations (g ¼ 0.028Cm2/W) with better ventilation. The red, dashed curve in Figure 3 illustrates the efﬁciency reduction due to heating for the example module for an ambient temperature of 158C. The DC power output of a PV generator with module area A and nominal power Pnom can be predicted by inserting Equations (1)–(3) into the equation: PDC ¼ hMPPðIt; TmÞItA ¼ hMPPðIt; TmÞ hSTC It 1000 W=m2 Pnom (4) with forecasted irradiance It and temperature Ta as input. For grid connected PV systems, also the efﬁciency of the inverter has to be considered in addition to the DC Figure 3.

Black: hMPP at Tm ¼ 258C, red: hMPP for realistic module temperatures derived using Equations (2) and (3) (Ta ¼ 158C, a ¼\u00040.0035/8C, g ¼ 0.0348Cm2/W), green: AC efﬁciency hAC. Prog.

We use a standard approach for modelling the conversion from DC to alternating current (AC) given in Schmidt and Sauer [24]. The parametric model describes the efﬁciency as a function of DC power input, using given efﬁciencies at three points of the curve as a basis. The overall conversion efﬁciency hAC from irradiance to AC power output for the example module and for a typical inverter is also given in Figure 3 (green curve). Finally, miscellaneous other losses which further reduce the system performance are taken into account by empirical factors. These additional losses include devi- ations of the actual module efﬁciencies from data sheet information (\u00045%) partly caused by reﬂection and spectral losses, mismatch between modules (\u00041.5%), ohmic cable losses (\u00040.5%), soiling (\u00041%), and deviation of inverter efﬁciencies from data sheet information (\u00041.5%). Overall, the additional losses accumulate to a factor of \u00049.5%. Long-time operational experience with monitoring of PV systems at Meteocontrol GmbH has proven that this is a reasonable value. To apply the described models the speciﬁcation of module and inverter characteristics is necessary as well as the description of orientation and tilt angle of the modules. Given correct parameters to characterize the PV systems, the accuracy of the global horizontal irradiance forecast is the determining factor for the quality of the power forecast, as shown in Ref. [15]. 3. REGIONAL POWER PREDICTION: UP-SCALING Regional PV power forecasts are derived by up-scaling from representative sets of systems, which is common practice also for wind power predictions (see, e.g. Ref. [1]). A simple summation of the power output of thousands of systems installed in a given area would be hardly feasible due to excess computational and data handling efforts. Furthermore, detailed system information necessary for simulation is generally not available for all PV systems. For example, in Germany, according to the renewable energy law EEG, all PV systems receiving the feed-in tariff have to be registered with address and nominal power, but more detailed information on module types or system orientations is not recorded. A proper up-scaling approach leads to almost no loss in accuracy given the representative set correctly represents the basic properties of the total data set. Due to spatial averaging effects, small-scale variability plays a minor role for regional forecasts and has not to be modelled in detail. Variations on larger scales with impact on the regional prediction, for example by approaching cloud fronts, can be modelled using representative systems, because the energy output of nearby systems is similar for spatially homogenous cloud ﬁelds or for clear sky situations. A quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of the up- scaling approach in preparatory case studies [3,18] demonstrated the importance of a correct representation of the spatial distribution of the installed power. Only if the spatial distribution of the overall nominal power is well approximated by the representative subsets, the regional power may be predicted with almost the same accuracy as if using the entire data set. Hence, the quality of the up-scaling procedure depends on the appropriate deﬁnition of a representative data set. Once deﬁned, the estimation of the regional power output Ppred(t) for a given time t by up-scaling of the predicted power sum for the representative systems Ppred,rep(t)is straightforward: PpredðtÞ¼ Pnom;allðtÞ Pnom;rep Ppred;repðtÞ ¼ Pnom;allðtÞ Pnom;rep XN i¼1 Ppred;iðtÞ; (5) where Pnom,rep denotes the nominal power of all representative systems, and Pnom,all(t) the time-dependent overall nominal power of all systems in the area. Ppred,i(t) denotes the power prediction for a single system of the representative data set including a number of N PV systems. Up-scaling is not only necessary to derive regional power forecasts, but also to estimate the actual regional power production, because power output is not recorded for the majority of PV systems. By replacing the predicted power output Ppred,rep with measured power output Pmeas,rep in Equation (5) we can estimate the actual power production for a given region. 3.1. Analysis of representative data sets In this section we describe and analyse the basic properties of the representative subsets for the forecasts for the control areas of the German transmission system operators ‘50 Hertz’ and ‘transpower’ presented here. For compari- son, corresponding information on the complete set of systems in these regions is given, based on the data published annually by utility companies and transmission system operators according to transparency guidelines of the German EEG. The representative data sets consist of 77 systems for the control area of ‘50 Hertz’, and of 306 systems for the control area of ‘transpower’. The distribution of the PV systems with additional information on PV system size is given in Figure 4. For both control areas the majority of the representative systems is located in the south, reﬂecting that a large share of the overall power is actually installed there, as illustrated in the left images of Figure 5. This analysis of the spatial distribution of the installed power of the entire data set is based on the state at the end of 2008. At this time more than 33 000 PV systems with an overall nominal power of 0.5 GW were installed in the control area of ‘50 Hertz’ and more than 181 000 PV systems with an overall nominal power of 2.4 GW in the control area of 762 Prog. Photovolt: Res. Appl. 2011; 19:757–771 \u0001 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. DOI: 10.1002/pip Regional PV power prediction E. Lorenz et al. ‘transpower’, respectively. Since then the amount of installed power has been continuously increasing. The overall nominal power is updated on a monthly basis for the control area of ‘transpower’ and every 6 weeks for the control area of ‘50 Hertz’. Recent values (April 2010) amount to 0.7 GW for ‘50Hertz’ and 4.7 GW for ‘transpower’. As outlined above, a correct representation of the overall data set is essential for proper up-scaling. Figure 5 compares the spatial distribution of the installed power of the entire data set to the representative subsets with a resolution of 18 \u0001 18. For the control area of ‘50 Hertz’ both ensembles show a maximum of the installed power between 128 and 138 East and 518 and 528 North. However, for the representative subset there is a much stronger concentration in this area than it is actually the case. Though for the control area of ‘transpower’ a better agreement between the distributions of the subset and the entire data set is found, the share of installed power in the south is still overestimated by the represen- tative subset. In order to obtain a better description of the overall power production we have investigated a modiﬁed approach of up-scaling, introduced in the next section. Besides the spatial distribution of the installed power, also the distribution of system orientations and the mix of module types inﬂuence the ensemble power production. Detailed information on module types, as well as the system orientations is not available for all systems and the distribution of those parameters has to be estimated from existing databases. In a ﬁrst simpliﬁed case study we compare the corresponding characteristics of the repre- sentative subsets to the characteristics of the complete monitoring data base of Meteocontrol GmbH with more than 8000 systems and an installed power of more than 1 GW. Despite the large number of systems available for the analysis this data set may differ from the characteristics of the complete ensemble in some aspects. The monitoring data base of Meteocontrol GmbH includes a dispropor- tionate share of large PV systems, because power production of small systems is often not monitored. This can, for example affect the distribution of system orientations, as large free standing installations often show an optimum orientation towards south, while the orientation of small roof top systems is determined by the orientation of the roof. Furthermore, tracking systems are not considered in the present analysis. The distribution of system orientations, deﬁned by azimuth and tilt angles, determines the daily course of the power production. A comparison of the frequency distributions of azimuth and tilt angles for the two representative subsets and for the complete data set of Meteocontrol GmbH revealed a reasonable agreement of system orientations for the three data sets, as shown in the left image of Figure 6 for the azimuth angles. Finally, the mix of module types has to be considered, because different module types show different part load behaviour, and an incorrect representation of module types in the subset can therefore lead to systematic deviations. The contribution of different module types for the different data sets is given in the right image of Figure 6. For all three data sets, roughly half of the modules are made of polycrystalline silicon cells and a quarter of the modules consist of monocrystalline silicon cells. The remaining modules are different thin ﬁlm technologies, with the largest share of CdTe cells. Summarizing, Figure 6 indicates that the selected subsets can provide a reasonable representation of the overall data sets with respect to system orientation and mix of modules, keeping in mind the restrictions mentioned above. A more detailed investigation consider- ing the inﬂuence of PV system size as well for the analysis of distributions as also for weighting the contribu- tions of the single systems to the overall installed power is planned. 3.2. Detailed up-scaling In order to achieve a better representation of the distribution of the installed power with the representative data sets, we investigate a second more detailed approach for up-scaling. The contribution of the single systems is weighted with an additional factor fscale(F, l) depending on the geographic location (latitude F, longitude l) of the PV systems: PscaleðtÞ¼ Pnom;allðtÞ Pnom;all0 XN i¼1 f ðfi; liÞPiðtÞ (6) where Pi(t) and Pscale(t) may be predicted or measured values. As a basis for the calculation of the scaling factors Figure 4. Representative PV systems (circles) as a basis for up- scaling to the power production of all systems (dots) for the control areas of ‘transpower’ (blue) and ‘50 Hertz’ (red). The position of the systems in the overall data set is determined by the postal codes which leads to a limited spatial resolution. For the representative data set the nominal power of the sys- tems is indicated by colour and size of the circles. Prog. Photovolt: Res. Appl. 2011; 19:757–771 \u0001 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. DOI: 10.1002/pip 763 E. Lorenz et al. Regional PV power prediction we use the spatial distribution of the representative subset and the real data sets with a resolution of 18 \u0001 18,as given in Figure 5, representing the state at the end of 2008. The overall installed power at that time is denoted as Pnom, all 0. For each grid point we derive the scaling factor fscale(f, l) as the ratio between overall installed power and installed power of the subset for this grid point: fscaleðf; lÞ¼ Pnom;allðf; lÞ Pnom;repðf; lÞ : (7) The scaling factor for a given PV system i is then given by the geographic location of the closest grid point. With this modiﬁed approach for up-scaling the spatial distri- bution of the original data sets is reproduced with the underlying resolution of 18 \u0001 18. 4. EVALUATION PROCEDURE In general various aspects may be taken into account for forecast evaluation (see, e.g. Jolliffe and Stephenson [25]). Depending on the target group and on the aim of the accuracy assessment different methods to assess prediction quality are appropriate. Here we use a basic set of accuracy measures, commonly applied in the context of evaluation of power forecasts (see, e.g. Refs. [1,5,14]). The evaluations are complemented by comparison to persist- ence as a reference model. Following, we give a short description of the forecast and measurement data used as a basis for the evaluation and an introduction to the accuracy measures and the reference model. Figure 5.

Lorenz et al. 4.1. Data sets Regional power forecasts for the control areas of ‘trans- power’ and ‘50 Hertz’ are evaluated for the period 2.7.2009 to 30.4.2010. Forecast data were missing for 7 days in the ‘50 Hertz’ evaluation data set and for 2 days in the ‘transpower’ evaluation data set. Intra-day and day-ahead forecasts with hourly resol- ution delivered every day at 7:00 local time are based on the ECMWF global model run at 12:00 UTC of the previous day. The operational forecasts are derived with the models and representative data sets described above using the simple up-scaling approach according to Equation (5). In a next step, the operational system will be updated to the modiﬁed up-scaling approach described in Section 3.2. Both approaches are included to the accuracy assessment. The actual power production for the control areas used as a reference in the evaluations is estimated using the detailed up-scaling approach described in Section 3.2 based on the representative data sets presented in Section 3.1. Here, it shall be stated explicitly that the measurement data set and the forecast data sets are derived using the same representative PV systems. Hence, any possible additional error due to up-scaling is not considered. However, as outlined before these additional errors are expected to be small. A basically automatic quality control was applied to the measurement data before summing up to regional power production. As a ﬁrst step, this implies a uniﬁcation of the time system. The different PV systems deliver measured data in different time systems, for example following daylight saving time or not. As this information is usually not documented, we have developed an automated procedure to shift the measured data to UTC, as the standard time system of the forecasts, based on a comparison to the forecast data. In a second step, clearly too high values are ﬁltered out. Finally, we have to deal with the problem that outages of the measurement system are not always clearly indicated, but often measured values of zero are provided in this case. Without further information it is difﬁcult to decide whether zero power values during daytime are caused by an outage of the measurement system and hence should be ﬁltered out or if they are caused by an outage of the PV system, for example due to snow cover or due to technical reasons, and should remain in the evaluation data set. We excluded values of zero during daytime only for the months, where no snow cover is to be expected. The regional power production is estimated using the measured power values that have passed the quality control, adapting also the overall nominal power for the representative systems PmesðtÞ¼ Pnom;allðtÞ PMðtÞ i¼1 f ðfi; liÞPnom;i XMðtÞ i¼1 f ðfi; liÞPiðtÞ (8) where M(t) denotes the number of values considered for a given time step. Pmeas(t) is referred to as measured regional power production in the following. 4.2. Accuracy measures The accuracy of the predictions is evaluated in comparison to measured PV power. In a ﬁrst step, the regional power values are normalized to the time dependent overall installed power Pnom(t), in order to obtain a better comparability between different data sets and to account for changes in the installed power during the period of evaluation. The normalized error of a single value is given as: \"ðtÞ¼ PpredðtÞ\u0004PmeasðtÞ PnomðtÞ : (9) Positive errors ei correspond to an overestimation by the prediction. Following common practice for the evaluation of solar and wind power predictions (e.g. Refs. [1,5,14]) we use the Figure 6. PV system orientations (left) and module types (right) of representative subsets for transpower and 50Hertz in comparison with the complete data set of Meteocontrol GmbH. An angle of 1808 corresponds to an orientation towards South. Prog. Photovolt: Res. Appl. 2011; 19:757–771 \u0001 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. DOI: 10.1002/pip 765 E. Lorenz et al.

The rmse is suitable for applications where small errors are more tolerable and larger errors cause disproportional high costs, as it is the case for utility applications. Furthermore, the mean value of the errors bias ¼ \" ¼ 1 N XN t¼1 \"ðtÞ (11) is given to describe systematic deviations of the forecast. The two statistical error measures are related to the mean of the measured values for the evaluation period: meanðPmeasÞ¼ 1 N XN t¼1 PmeasðtÞ Pnom;i : (12) All hours of the day are included to the evaluation here, because this meets the requirements of users in the electric utility sector. However, this is not always the case for evaluations of solar irradiance or power predictions. For example within the solar resource assessment community usually only daytime values with non-zero solar irradiance are considered for accuracy assessment (e.g. Refs. [12,13,17]). The trivial case of deriving perfect forecasts of Ppred ¼ 0 at night is neglected. Obviously, the choice whether including night values or not has a signiﬁcant impact on the values of statistical error measures, and has to be considered when comparing results of different publications. Evaluation results are grouped according to the forecast horizon in days, that is results are provided for intra-day forecasts and day-ahead forecast separately. There are two reasons for grouping results according to forecast lead-time in days rather than in hours. First, forecasts are only updated once a day, and, second, there is a strong dependency of forecast accuracy on the daytime caused by the daily course of irradiance. 4.3. Reference forecast: persistence In addition to the accuracy information in terms of statistical error measures, it is useful to check, whether the forecast model provides better results than any trivial reference model. It is worthwhile to implement and run a complex forecasting tool only if it is able to clearly outperform trivial models. The probably most common reference model for short term forecasts is persistence. For irradiance and power forecasts, the deterministic daily irradiance pattern should be considered as an additional constraint. Here we use a simple approach of persistence Pper modelling the daily course of power production by considering the latest available measured value at the same day-time as a forecast value: Pper;d24hðtÞ¼ Pmeasðt\u0004d24 hÞ; (13) where d denotes the forecast horizon in days. Advanced approaches of persistence based on the average cloud situation of the previous day in combination with a clear sky model (see Ref. [17]) perform superior to this simple approach. However, though applicable straightforward for irradiance forecasts, for PV power forecasts this approach is related with additional simu- lation effort, and therefore not applied here. In order to evaluate the performance of forecast models in comparison to trivial reference models, we use the concept of skill scores that is commonly applied in meteorology (see, e.g. Ref. [25]). The gain of forecast quality when using the forecast model instead of the reference model is set into relation to the difference between the scores, for example rmse, of a perfect forecast and the reference forecast: ssscore ¼ scoreforecast\u0004scorereference forecast scoreperfect forecast\u0004scorereference forecast : (14) The skill score ss takes the value 1 for a perfect forecast and the value 0 for the reference forecast. The skill score is negative when a forecast model performs worse than the reference model. 5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The evaluation of the power forecasts starts with an overview on the results for the operational version of the forecast algorithm in comparison to the modiﬁed up- scaling approach. This is followed by a more detailed analysis with respect to the performance of the forecasts for different weather situations and seasons. Finally, we provide information on the distribution of forecast errors with special focus on the occurrence of extreme deviations between forecasts and measurements. 5.1. Overall evaluation The basic accuracy measures for the operational and the modiﬁed forecast are summarized in Tables I and II for intra-day and day-ahead forecasts for the two control areas. For better comparison, the rmse values as main scores of forecast evaluation are additionally visualized in Figure 7. With rmse values in the range of 4–5% for intra-day and day-ahead forecast horizons the operational PV power forecasts can already at the current state-of-the-art contribute to an improved grid integration of PV power. The errors are in the same range as for current operational wind power prediction systems (see, e.g. Ref. [1]) that already have demonstrated their value and importance for the grid- integration of large shares of wind power into the grid. The augmentation of rmse values when extending the forecast horizon from intra-day to day-ahead forecasts is 766 Prog. Photovolt: Res. Appl. 2011; 19:757–771 \u0001 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. DOI: 10.1002/pip Regional PV power prediction E. Lorenz et al. only small. This is in agreement with previous studies for irradiance forecasts in Ref. [15]. For the operational forecasts for the control area of ‘‘50Hertz’’ there is even a decrease of the rmse value for the day-ahead forecasts in comparison to the intra-day forecasts. This can be explained by looking at the different components contributing to the rmse, as described for example in Ref. [25]. The correlation coefﬁcient between forecasted and measured time series is decreasing from intra-day to day-ahead forecasts as expected. However, systematic deviations in both mean values and amplitudes of the operational forecasts are larger for the intra-day than for the day-ahead forecasts and result in a decreasing overall rmse. These systematic deviations are introduced by the choice of the representative subset which is dominated by systems between 12o und 13 o East and 51 o und 52 o North (see Fig. 5). The standard deviation of the predicted values is too large, because there are less averaging effects than for the real ensemble. The irradiance forecasts used as input for the power predictions show a smaller standard deviation for the day-ahead forecasts than for the intra-day forecasts as a consequence of the applied post-processing. This partly compensates systematic deviations introduced by the PV simulation. A post-processing procedure applied also for the power prediction would avoid this effect. The bias of the operational forecast amounts to about 1% for both control areas. On average, the forecasted irradiances overestimate the actual power production. This reveals that there is potential for improvement with a bias correction using measured power values as an input. The comparison of the operational version of the forecast to the modiﬁed up-scaling approach shows that there is a considerable improvement by the new approach with respect to both, rmse and bias. These results again demonstrate the importance of a correct modelling of the spatial distribution of the installed power for up-scaling approaches. Though the bias is reduced using this approach an overestimation by the forecasts still remains. The improvement is more pronounced for intra-day than for day-ahead forecasts. Both forecasting approaches perform much better than persistence with an improvement in terms of ssrmse in the range of 30–40% for intra-day forecasts, and in the range of 40–50% for day-ahead forecasts. Forecast errors are smaller for the control area of ‘transpower’ extended from the south of Germany (478 North) to the north of Germany (558 North) than for the control area of ‘50 Hertz’, covering the smaller area 50.5– 54.58 North and 10–158 East (see also Figure 4). With increasing size of a region forecast errors are decreasing due to spatial averaging effects, as described quantitatively in a detailed study for irradiance forecasts in Ref. [15].

Regional PV power prediction addition to the region size the distribution of the installed power of PV systems inﬂuences the error of regional power forecasts. The improvement by the modiﬁed up-scaling approach is more pronounced for the control area of ‘50 Hertz’ due to larger deviations between the spatial distribution of the representative subset and the actually installed power for this control area. The mean value of the power production for the considered period of evaluation amounts to 9.1% of the nominal power for ‘50 Hertz’, and to 9.5% for ‘trans- power’. The deterministic daily and seasonal course of irradiance including periods with zero irradiance during night-time is the main reason for these low values. Even for optimum cloud-free conditions the mean annual power production would be far below nominal power. Irradiance conditions around 1000 W/m2 on the module plane may only occur around noon for a limited period during the year, depending on the tilt and orientation of modules. Additionally, it has to be taken into account that the period of evaluation does not cover the complete year. With May and June 2 months with comparatively high power production are missing. A more detailed investigation of the seasonal dependence of the mean power production is given in the next section. 5.2. Detailed analysis A more detailed view on forecast accuracies is obtained by visual inspection of predicted and measured values in comparison. In particular, we investigate and discuss the inﬂuence of different weather conditions and solar elevation on power production and forecast accuracy. These factors lead to a typical seasonal dependence of power production and forecasts accuracy. The analysis in this section is exemplarily performed on basis of the intra- day forecasts for the control area of ‘transpower’. Measured and predicted PV power production is compared in Figure 8 for two selected periods covering different weather situations in January and April 2010. A scatter plot (Figure 9) of forecasted over measured power values gives a complementary picture of the performance of the forecasts during the complete evaluation period. Due to the seasonal variations of sun elevation power production is much smaller during the winter months than in the summer months with maximum values of P/Pnom ¼ 0.85. Figure 8 illustrates the range of possible power output for the months January (P/Pnom < 0.35), February (P/Pnom < 0.55) and March (P/Pnom < 0.75). The maximum possible power production in a given situation also limits forecast errors because we use a physical prediction models here, considering the daily and annual irradiance pattern. Apart from the deterministic course of irradiance, cloud cover is the main factor inﬂuencing power production. As for the example given in Figure 8 (left) changes in weather conditions are mostly predicted well and partly cloudy days (e.g. 1.4.2010 to 5.4.2010) are clearly distinguished from mainly clear sky days (e.g. 6.4.2010 to 7.4.2010). Consequently, most data points are relatively close to identity in Figure 9. Larger deviations of up to 25% of the nominal power are observed only for single situations if the measured power values are larger than 0.2. Still, for very low power values (P/Pnom < 0.2) an accu- mulation of data points with a considerable overestimation mainly for January and February 2010 is noticeable. These data points are related to snow cover on modules that may occur during winter. Snow cover on modules may almost completely suppress power production not only for single systems but also for a large part of the systems contributing to the overall power production. An example illustrating this effect is given in Figure 8 (right) for the days 14.1.2010 Figure 8. Comparison of time-series of measured (red lines with circles) and predicted power output (blue line) for the control area of ‘transpower’, 1.4.2010 to 8.4.2010 (left) and 14.1.2010 to 20.1.2010 (right). 768 Prog. Photovolt: Res. Appl. 2011; 19:757–771 \u0001 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. DOI: 10.1002/pip Regional PV power prediction E. Lorenz et al. to 16.1.2010. The actual power production is very low, while according to the forecasts a much higher power production is to be expected. Snow cover on modules rather than cloud cover as a reason for this low power production has been identiﬁed on basis of Meteocontrols’ monitoring data. The current version of the forecasting scheme does not model snow cover on modules, which leads to the observed overestimation of power production on days with snow cover, in particular for clear sky days. Still, due do low solar elevations during winter limiting the possible power production, the magnitude of forecast errors is restricted also and forecast errors stay below 35% of the nominal power. Figure 10 shows the seasonal dependence of forecasts errors (rmse and bias) for the two forecasting approaches and persistence in relation to the monthly mean values of power production. The strong seasonal dependence of the power production with more than 16% of the installed power in the summer months and less than 2% of the installed power in January 2010 is a consequence of changing solar elevation and meteorological conditions, including snow covered modules during winter. The rmse of both forecasting approaches is in the range of 3–5% for months without snow covered modules. For these months also a clearly better performance in comparison to persistence is found. In December 2009 and February 2010 rmse values for persis- tence and forecasts are similar, while for January the rmse of persistence is signiﬁcantly below forecast rmse values. This indicates that an integration of measured power output to the forecasting scheme can signiﬁcantly reduce forecast errors due to snow cover on modules, especially if these situations remain stable over several days as for the example given in Figure 8 (right). A self-calibrating recursive model based on the latest available power measurements is currently under investigation. PV monitoring data of Meteocontrol GmbH are updated either daily or every 15 min and therefore provide an excellent data source for this post-processing approach. A preliminary case study in Ref. [18] has approved the high potential for improvement, not only for periods with snow cover. 5.3. Frequency distribution and extreme values of forecast errors The analysis of forecast accuracy is complemented with an evaluation of the frequency distribution of forecast errors with focus on the occurrence of large deviations between forecasts and measurements. Transmission system operators as main users of regional PV power predictions are particularly interested in the analysis of extreme deviations because they cause disproportionately high ﬁnancial losses. Figure 10. Mean power production and error measures for persistence (red lines with circles), operational forecasts (blue lines with triangles), and scaled forecasts (orange line with squares) in dependence of the month. Solid lines show the rmse, dashed lines give the bias. Figure 11.

Appl. 2011; 19:757–771 \u0001 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. DOI: 10.1002/pip 769 E. Lorenz et al. Regional PV power prediction The cumulated frequency distribution of the absolute values of of normalized forecast errors, shown in Figure 11 for the operational intra-day forecasts for ‘50 Hertz’, gives a quantitative description of the distribution of forecasts errors, which already has been illustrated in Figure 9. Thirty two percent of the situations with forecast errors of zero correspond to night-time values. Forecast errors are smaller than 5% of the nominal power in more than 80% of all situations and smaller than 10% of the nominal power in more than 90% of all situations. A more detailed view on extreme deviations is given in Tables III and IV for the control areas of ‘50 Hertz’ and ‘transpower’ respectively, separating also between over- and underestimation by the forecasts. Most of the extreme deviations are related to overestimation. The tables show that maximum observed overestimation is between 30% and 40% for the operational intra-day and day-ahead forecasts for both control areas. The number of hours with overestimation more than 20% of the nominal power for the control area of ‘transpower’ is smaller than for ‘50 Hertz’, because spatial averaging has a strong impact especially for large forecast errors. It is also noticeable that the number of hours with overestimation of more than 20% of the nominal power is strongly reduced using the modiﬁed up-scaling approach for both control areas. Maximum values of under- estimation are about \u000425% for intra-day and day-ahead forecasts and the number of hours with underestimation of more than 20% of the nominal power is small. 6. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK The beneﬁt of PV power prediction for grid integration purposes in particular with respect to increasing cost efﬁciency has been outlined in the beginning of this paper. PV power prediction will be an essential component of a future sustainable energy supply system integrating large amounts of ﬂuctuating renewable power. We have presented and evaluated a regional PV power prediction service based on ECMWF global model irradiance forecasts. The proposed approach includes a post-processing procedure to derive optimised, site- speciﬁc irradiance forecast and explicit physical modelling steps to convert the predicted irradiances to PV power. Finally, regional power forecast are derived by up-scaling from a representative set of PV systems. In order to better model the spatial distribution of the nominal power in an area, we have proposed a detailed, modiﬁed approach for up-scaling. The operational PV power prediction system has been evaluated in comparison to the modiﬁed up-scaling approach for the control areas of the two German transmission system operators ‘transpower’ and ‘50 Hertz’ for the period 2.7.2009 to 30.4.2010. With rmse values in the range of 4–5% for intra-day and day-ahead forecast horizons the operational PV power forecasts can already at the current state-of-the-art contribute to an improved grid integration of PV power. Further improvement can be achieved with the modiﬁed up-scaling approach. These results demonstrate the importance of a correct modelling of the spatial distribution of the installed power for up- scaling approaches. A detailed error analysis has been performed in order to get a deeper insight to the performance of the forecasts for different weather situations and to identify potential for further improvement. While changes of the weather condi- tions are mostly predicted well by the proposed forecasting system, snow cover on modules during winter leads to a strong overestimation of the actual power production. In order to solve this problem we currently investigate a self- calibrating recursive post-processing procedure based on the PV monitoring data of Meteocontrol GmbH. Table III.
