Liquidity Costs on Intraday Power Markets: Continuous Trading Versus Auctions Thomas Kuppelwiesera,∗, David Wozabala aTUM School of Management, Technical University of Munich, Arcisstraße 21, 80333 Munich, Germany Abstract We analyze liquidity costs on continuous and auction-based intraday power markets using a cost- of-round-trip measure that works for both market designs. We use data from the Italian auction- based intraday market and the German continuous market and present descriptive statistics as well as multivariate regression models to analyze determinants of liquidity costs in both markets. To test for diﬀerences in liquidity due to market design, we employ a double machine learning technique controlling for several confounding variables. We show that weekly patterns, yearly seasonality, electricity demand, as well as the inﬂuence of temperatures signiﬁcantly aﬀect liquidity costs. Comparing liquidity costs in both market, we ﬁnd that, overall, liquidity costs are lower on the Italian market. However, Italian costs increase towards later auctions, while the costs on the German continuous intraday market decrease and reach their low close to physical delivery, where costs are lower than on the last Italian market trading the corresponding products.

Introduction In the last two decades electricity markets world-wide have moved from being dominated by highly vertically integrated monopolies to competitive markets populated by many diverse play- ers. To satisfy these companies’ requirements, electricity trading takes place in multi-settlement markets that allow trading products with diﬀerent temporal granularities and with diﬀerent times to maturity. In particular, the growing share of variable renewable production led to the rising importance of spot markets, making it possible to adapt traded positions until close to delivery as new information arrives. While in the US the day-ahead market is immediately followed by the real-time balancing market (Ela et al., 2014), European market designs feature a spot market that is split into a day-ahead market and an intraday market where power can be traded until shortly before physical delivery. Currently, there are two prevailing designs of intraday markets in Europe. While most European countries use continuous trading, Italy, Spain, and Portugal mainly use staggered intraday market auctions. Clearly, the beneﬁts of intraday trading are closely tied to the liquidity of the market, i.e., the ability of ﬁrms to trade while experiencing only minimal adverse price eﬀects. Furthermore, liquid markets are less prone to market manipulation and gaming by pivotal players. However, liquidity in most European intraday markets remains rather low. Weber (2010) ﬁnds that markets in Germany and several other European countries are not suﬃciently liquid. Garnier and Madlener (2015) conclude that due to this illiquidity, current intraday markets are of limited use in balancing short-term forecast errors in demand and variable renewable production. It is therefore interesting to policy makers and industry professionals alike to identify factors that drive liquidity in the two market designs and understand how the designs themselves inﬂuence liquidity. Consequently, the issue of liquidity in intraday markets has recently attracted some attention in the academic literature. Weber (2010) analyzes the integration of wind energy considering diﬀerent European market designs and ﬁnds that the intraday auctions in Spain are the most attractive in terms of trading volume. Based on transaction data from the German intraday market, Hagemann and Weber (2013) investigate liquidity in intraday power markets using established measures from ﬁnancial markets. Neuhoﬀ et al. (2016) ﬁnd that the additional auctions for 15 minutes contracts in the German intraday markets increased liquidity and market depth while reducing price volatility. Balardy (2018) is one of the ﬁrst, who uses the German limit order book (LOB) data to analyze 2 liquidity in terms of bid-ask-spreads and market depths. The author ﬁnds a positive relation between bid-ask spreads and risk as well as a negative relation between bid-ask spread and adjustment needs, activity, and competition in the market. von Luckner et al. (2017) use the LOB to ﬁnd an optimal market maker pricing and analyze the market order intensity and the bid-ask spread. Hagemann and Weber (2015) analyze intraday trading volumes on auction-based and continuous intraday markets, and observe higher volumes on the auction-based intraday markets. The authors conclude that this diﬀerence is not due to the diﬀerence in market design but rather due to idiosyncratic factors aﬀecting the two markets. The literature on electricity forecasting is in many ways related to our paper. Most models for price forecasts are time-series models using exogenous variables, some of which we also use in our models. For example, as in Narajewski and Ziel (2020) and Uniejewski and Weron (2018), we use time dummies for Saturday, Sunday and Monday, and the day-ahead forecast for load, solar production and wind power as covariates in our regression models. Marcjasz et al. (2020) use dummies for each weekday, forecasts for load, solar production and wind production and its forecast errors, and balancing volumes. Janke and Steinke (2019) use the forecastFs of demand and renewable production, and hourly dummies for each hour. Despite the importance of the topic, the literature analyzing liquidity costs in intraday power markets remains scarce. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst paper to compare liquidity costs of the two markets in a statistically sound way using the complete order book data of the continuous intraday market and all submitted orders of the intraday auction. In this paper, we contribute to the discussion by the ﬁrst analysis of intraday electricity market liquidity that is based on a cost-of-round-trip (CRT) measure which captures all quantitative aspects of liquidity both in auction markets as well as for continuous trading. We provide a univariate analysis of the CRT which is complemented by regression models that explore possible drivers of liquidity costs on the German and Italian market. We ﬁnd that, depending on the market, liquidity cost are driven by weekly patterns, yearly seasonalities, electricity demand, as well as temperatures. To directly compare the cost of liquidity and thus measure the impact of market design, we use a state-of-the-art double machine learning method proposed in Chernozhukov et al. (2018) controlling for possible confounding factors identiﬁed in the analysis for the CRT for the two markets. Comparing the two markets, by and large the Italian auction-based market exhibits lower CRTs. We observe this result in a univariate analysis and conﬁrm it in a multivariate analysis 3 controlling for the confounding factors identiﬁed above. However, this eﬀect gets progressively weaker for larger traded volumes and as trading time approaches physical delivery. In particular, it can be observed that the German continuous intraday market consistently exhibits lower costs for high volumes close to delivery. Our ﬁndings suggest that a combination of several auction-based intraday markets with contin- uous trading might be able to leverage the beneﬁts of both systems. In particular, auctions can be used to increase liquidity and therefore decrease trading costs by pooling orders for products which are far from delivery. These auctions could be complemented by continuous trading close to deliv- ery, where market participants have the opportunity to trade the forecast errors for demand and variable renewable production at a point in time when accurate forecasts are available (see Ocker and Jaenisch, 2020, for a similar proposal). In fact, Spain already implemented such a hybrid sys- tem when it joined the cross-border intraday market project XBID in June 2018. This proposal is close to the literature on optimal implementations of the European target model for a single coupled intraday market as laid out in the European Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222. Bellenbaum et al. (2014) discuss diﬀerent intraday market designs meeting these requirements and come to the conclusion, that a hybrid between continuous trading and auctions potentially combines the advantages of both designs. Similarly, Ehrenmann et al. (2019) propose to add additional auction markets to the existing continuous market, as auction markets are more suitable for small market participants. The authors see a clear advantage of this setting, but the question remains at which time of the day to introduce auction markets and how many. A possible solution that leverages the advantages of both continuous trading and auctions is to have a large number of frequent auctions as proposed in Budish et al. (2015) for ﬁnancial markets and in Deutsche B¨orse Group (2018) for the intraday power market. Such a design would alleviate some of the problems of continuous trading while still providing market participants with ample opportunities to trade. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy describe the Italian and German intraday markets. Section 3 describes the market data and our set of explanatory variables. In Section 4, we introduce the cost-of-roundtrip measure and specify the econometric models used to determine the factors driving liquidity costs in both markets as well as the application of double machine learning, which we use to determine the eﬀect of market design on liquidity costs. Section 5 discusses the empirical results. Finally, Section 6 concludes, discusses limitations and policy implications. 4 Quantity Italy Germany Consumption (TWh) 322.2 538.1 PV infeed (TWh) 22.9 41.2 Wind infeed (TWh) 17.3 107.2 Imports (TWh) 47.1 31.5 Exports (TWh) 3.3 82.7 Day-ahead trading volume (TWh) 212.9 234.5 Intraday trading volume (TWh) 25.4 37.8 Volume weighted day-ahead price (e/MWh) 62.22 43.26 Volume weighted intraday price (e/MWh) 61.05 46.6 Table 1: Summary of annual key characteristics of the two markets for 2018.

Background: Market Designs in Germany and Italy In this short section, we discuss the relevant facts about the Italian auction-based intraday market and then proceed to discuss the German continuous intraday market. We collect key characteristics of the two markets for the year 2018 from ENTSO-E (2019); GME (2019); Burger (2019) in Table 1, and calculated the Italian weighted prices based on the national price. Note that the traded volumes of the day-ahead market and the intraday market of hourly products of the two markets are comparable. Consumption and production of renewables are higher in Germany, and Italy is a net importer of electricity while Germany generates high volumes for export, since it has signiﬁcant overcapacities in cheap base-load production. As a result, average spot market prices in Germany are lower than in Italy. 2.1. The Italian IPEX The Italian spot market oﬀers a platform to trade electricity for delivery in hourly granularity. The day-ahead market in Italy closes at noon on the day before delivery and is followed by seven intraday auction markets, called MI (mercato infragiornaliero). Bid prices are constrained between 5 e0 and e3000 while bid quantities are restricted to multiples of 1 kWh. For more details see GME (2016). The Italian power grid consists of the six market zones NORD, CNORD, CSUD, SUD, SICI, and SARD. The MI markets are organized as uniform price auctions that aggregate the bids of all zones. The left plot in Figure 1 shows the cleared volume and the clearing price of an exemplary market session. If the resulting national market outcome is physically infeasible due to lack of transmission line capacities between the zones, the result is made feasible by altering the market outcome resulting in diﬀerent zonal prices for the diﬀerent Italian market zones. For our analysis, we disregard this complication, by only considering the national price, which considers all submitted oﬀers without taking into account the eﬀects of transmission limits between zones. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the Italian intraday market. The lead-time, deﬁned as the time between the last possibility to trade the speciﬁc product and its physical delivery, range from 4.25 to 10.5 hours. Since wind power forecasts signiﬁcantly improve approaching delivery (e.g., Hannele Holttinen, 2013), this relatively long lead-time make it hard to incorporate the last and therefore most precise production forecasts. 2.2. The German EPEX SPOT Market The German day-ahead market closes at noon of the previous day and is followed by an auction for quarter-hours of the next day at 3 p.m. and a continuous intraday market. For a detailed description we refer to the operational rules in EPEX (2019) and to Table 2 for a summary of trading times. In contrast to the Italian MI markets, the German intraday market is based on continuous trading with a limit order book (LOB) much like in ﬁnancial markets. Next to hourly products 1/2-hour and 1/4-hour products are traded. We do not include these products in our analysis, since shorter deliveries serve diﬀerent purposes than hourly products. In particular, ﬁrms use sub-hourly products to model the ramps of their production or consumption, which is possible only to a small extent with hourly products. To be comparable to the Italian market, isolate the eﬀect of market design on liquidity, and avoid diluting our analysis by mixing in diﬀerent aspects, we therefore only consider hourly products in our analysis. The market for a speciﬁc product closes 30 minutes (or 5 minutes within the control area) before delivery, which facilitates trading forecast errors of ﬂuctuating renewable energy sources. 6 Market Products Opening Closing Results Last Update Lead-Time (h) Italian Markets MI1 H1 − H24 12:55 (d-1) 15:00 (d-1) 15:30 (d-1) - - MI2 H1 − H24 12:55 (d-1) 16:30 (d-1) 17:00 (d-1) H1 − H4 7 1 2 up to 10 1 2 MI3 H5 − H24 17:30 (d-1) 23:45 (d-1) 00:15 (d) H5 − H8 4 1 4 up to 7 1 4 MI4 H9 − H24 17:30 (d-1) 3:45 (d) 4:15 (d) H9 − H12 4 1 4 up to 7 1 4 MI5 H13 − H24 17:30 (d-1) 7:45 (d) 8:15 (d) H13 − H16 4 1 4 up to 7 1 4 MI6 H17 − H24 17:30 (d-1) 11:15 (d) 11:45 (d) H17 − H20 4 3 4 up to 7 3 4 MI7 H21 − H24 17:30 (d-1) 15:45 (d) 16:15 (d) H21 − H24 4 1 4 up to 7 1 4 German Markets Intraday Auction QH1 − QH96 d-45 15:00 (d-1) 15:10 (d-1) - - Continuous H H1 − H24 15:00 (d-1) D-5’ - H1 − H24 5 60 Continuous QH QH1 − QH96 16:00 (d-1) D-5’ - QH1 − QH96 5 60 Continuous HH HH1 − HH48 15:30 (d-1) D-5’ - HH1 − HH48 5 60 Table 2: Operating times of the German and the Italian intraday markets. The table reports the traded products, the opening and closing times of the markets (d-1 indicating a time on the day before delivery), the time when the results are announced, the list of products that are traded the last time on the respective market, as well as the lead time for the products that are traded the last time. H indicates a hourly product, HH stands for half-hour and QH for a quarter-hourly product while D signiﬁes the time of delivery. Market participants can submit buy and sell oﬀers for prices ranging between −9999.9e/MWh and 9999.9e/MWh, with a minimum bid size of 0.1MWh, and several speciﬁed order types (Martin and Otterson, 2018). A submitted bid/oﬀer is cleared immediately if the price is better than the best price of an oﬀer/bid in the LOB. If there is no such matching order, the new order is stored in the LOB and matched with orders arriving at a later point in time. The right plot in Figure 1 shows the best available bid and ask price over time with each tick representing a match between a newly placed order and an order in the order book generating a trade. 3. Data In Section 3.1, we discuss the market data which we use for the Italian and German intraday market. In Section 3.2, we introduce variables which we use in Section 4 and Section 5 as controls in our comparison of the two market designs. 7 0 200 400 600 MWh 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Auction Clearing Demand Supply Apr 15, 00:00 Apr 15, 12:00 2018 15 20 25 30 35 40 Continuous Trading Best Bid Best Ask Tick Figure 1: Clearing of the Italian MI3 intraday auction (left) and German continuous trading for the 13th hour on the 15.04.2018.

Market Data All oﬀers submitted to the Italian intraday market are available on the website of the Italian Power Exchange (IPEX). The oﬀers contain information about the side (sell or buy), product/hour, intraday market (MI1-MI7), zone, price and volume and can be used to calculate the national price. The LOB of the German continuous intraday market can be purchased from EPEX SPOT SE. The data-set includes information about the side (sell or buy), product/hour, validity period, control area, as well as the price and volume of every submitted bid/oﬀer. We note that the EPEX allows for the submission of so called iceberg orders, for which the bid quantity is only gradually revealed as parts of the order get executed. We only consider those parts of iceberg orders that were actually executed in our analysis. For more information about the LOB-data we refer to Martin and Otterson (2018). The German intraday trading system was subject to frequent changes in the recent years with eﬀects on market liquidity, especially shortly before delivery. In order to have a dataset with consistent market rules, we restrict our analysis of both markets to the time from 20.11.2017, a few 8 Variable Frequency Unit Source RS,I t Italian solar production hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu F S,I t Italian solar forecast hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu RW,I t Italian wind production hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu F W,I t Italian wind forecast hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu RD,I t Italian demand hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu F D,I t Italian demand forecast hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu RS,G t German solar production 1 4 -hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu F S,G t German solar forecast 1 4 -hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu RW,G t German wind production 1 4 -hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu F W,G t German wind forecast 1 4 -hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu RD,G t German demand 1 4 -hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu F D,G t German demand forecast 1 4 -hourly MWh https://transparency.entsoe.eu Dt Daylight of Munich daily days https://galupki.de T I t Temperature of Milan hourly ◦C www.arpalombardia.it T G t Temperature of Berlin hourly ◦C www.dwd.de Wt Weekends daily Boolean - Table 3: Overview of data used in the analysis. days after the trading system M7 (version 6.0) was launched to the 15.06.2018, when the XBID project was introduced. 3.2. Explanatory Variables Table 3 provides an overview of the variables which potentially have an impact on the CRT and which we control in our comparison of the two market designs in Section 5. Motivated by Goodarzi et al. (2019); Kulakov and Ziel (2020) who show that forecast errors in renewable production inﬂuence intrady prices and by Balardy (2018) who observes an impact of renewable energy sources on bid-ask spreads, we include data on forecasts and actual production of variable renewables in both countries. Since we exclusively analyse hourly products, we consider the average over the four quarter-hourly quantities to obtain hourly values. We use the day-ahead forecasts for renewable production as published by ENTSO-E. While the forecasts used by individual 9 market participants for trading might be diﬀerent, we think that the chosen forecast captures the overall sentiment of the market well. Temperature inﬂuences power markets, because power is used for temperature regulation of buildings. Hence, we introduce a heating- and a cooling-function as described in Fan and Hyndman (2012) for Italy and Germany. The cooling function of Italy C I t and Germany C G t are deﬁned as max(Tt − 19.5 ◦C, 0), where Tt is the hourly temperature at time t in Italy (Milan) or Germany (Berlin). Analogously, we introduce the heating function for Italy H I t and Germany H G t as min(Tt − 17.5 ◦C, 0). The choice of the two cities as temperature proxies is motivated by the fact that Milan is the leading industrial city in Italy and Berlin is the largest German city. A more detailed modeling of the inﬂuence of temperatures could be based on weighted temperatures from several areas in Germany and Italy as was for example done in Graf and Wozabal (2013); Kovacevic and Wozabal (2014); Pape et al. (2016). However, for the purpose of this paper we stick to the abovementioned simple approach. Prices on power markets follow a seasonal and weekly pattern. Hence, as in Kovacevic and Wozabal (2014) and Graf and Wozabal (2013), we use a variable containing the length of daylight Dt in units of days to capture annual seasonality of the observations. As these quantities are similar for both countries, we use the day-length of Munich located in the south of Germany for both markets. Moreover, as in Narajewski and Ziel (2020) and Uniejewski and Weron (2018) we introduce dummy variables Wt = (W M on t , W Sat t , W Sun t ) for Monday, Saturday, and Sunday for weekends Wt to model weekly price patterns. To capture the overall market size and therefore the scarcity of supply in a given period t, we use the forecast as well as the actual demand for Italy and Germany. An alternative way to capture the scarcity in an electricity system would be the so called load-supply-ratio (LSR) as deﬁned by Pape et al. (2016). The LSR takes into account detailed modeling of supply and demand and is a more accurate measure of scarcity than mere electricity demand. However, the demand is easier to include in our analysis, since it requires much less detailed data. 4. Methodology In this section, we ﬁrst detail how we measure liquidity costs in the two markets by a cost-of- round-trip measure in Section 4.1. In Section 4.2, we introduce a multivariate regression model to analyse the impact of possible confounding factors in the comparison of the two market designs. 10 Finally, in Section 4.3, we discuss a double machine learning method in order to measure whether the continuous markets in Germany or the auction markets in Italy lead to higher CRTs. 4.1. Liquidity Measures Market liquidity describes the possibility to quickly buy or sell an asset without aﬀecting the market price. This rather vague deﬁnition of liquidity does not lend itself to a quantitative analysis of the phenomenon. In fact, there is no single established quantitative measure of liquidity in the literature that captures all aspects of market liquidity. Hagemann and Weber (2013) introduced six dimensions of liquidity for continuous energy mar- kets using established measures from the literature on ﬁnancial markets. The ﬁrst dimension is tightness and is measured using bid-ask spreads deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the best bid and best ask price. The second dimension is resiliency describing the market’s ability to bounce back to an equilibrium price after a temporary distortion. The third dimension is price impact or market depth and describes the impact of large orders which might require several oﬀers beyond the best price to be cleared. The fourth dimension is known as short-run price volatility. The ﬁfth dimension captures delay and search costs describing the propensity of traders to delay trades to obtain better prices. The sixth dimension describes trading activity in the form of traded volume, number of trades, and number of active traders. Irvine et al. (2000) introduced a CRT-measure as the per dollar cost of roundtrip trade of D dollars. In particular, the number of shares that corresponds to the dollar amount D are calculated based on the best-bid and best-ask, and afterwards the LOB is used to calculate the resulting cost of buying and selling the determined number of shares. Since the interpretation in terms of quantities is more natural in power markets, we modify this deﬁnition by proposing a CRT measure which depends on volume V instead of the amount of money and captures all aforementioned cost related dimensions of liquidity. Moreover, we modify the measure to be applicable to both continuous trading as well as auction markets. Conceptually, the CRT is the per unit cost incurred by buying a certain quantity V of power and then immediately selling it again. Note that in a liquid market CRT is close to zero. Choosing a small V yields measurements close to the bid-ask spread while larger volumes increasingly measure the depth of the order book plus all additional costs. More formally, we deﬁne a volume oriented measure by sorting the buy- and sell side of the 11 LOB at each point in time t by price to obtain · · · < P t −2 < P t −1 < P t −0 < P t 0 < P t 1 < P t 2 < · · · , where P t −0 is the highest bid-price and P t 0 is the lowest ask-price. We denote the corresponding bid quantities by Q t i. For a given quantity V in MWh, we deﬁne how much of an order i would be cleared when placing a market order of size V by ¯Q t i(V ) = min ( max ( V − i−1∑ k=0 Q t k, 0 ) , Q t i ) , ¯Q t −i(V ) = min ( max ( V − −0∑ k=−i+1 Q t k, 0 ) , Q t −i ) . We then deﬁne the cost-of-round-trip measure for a ﬁxed value V as CRTt(V ) = 1 V ∑ k P t k ¯Q t k(V ) | {z } average cost − 1 V ∑ k P t −k ¯Q t −k(V ) | {z } average revenue . (1) In a continuous market it is possible to execute the buy and sell decisions that are used to deﬁne the CRT, making equation (1) directly applicable. However, we note that, in principle, a trader in a continuous market has the option to spread her trades over a longer period of time, waiting for more orders on the other side of the market to arrive. In this way, some of the liquidity costs measured by the CRT can be avoided at the cost of the risk of adversely changing prices during the extended time of bidding. The CRT on the continuous intraday market can therefore be seen as an overestimation that accurately reﬂects liquidity costs only for an impatient trader placing market orders. To use the CRT in an auction market, we add a market order for buying V units to the existing orders and record the marginal price instead of per unit cost when clearing the auction modiﬁed in this way. We then subtract the hypothetical sell price of V units which we calculate adding a market order of size V on the sell side instead and divide the result by V . The resulting CRT-measure of the auction market consists of one value for each market and volume. In contrast, the CRT-measure of a certain product in a continuous market is a function of time and potentially changes with each modiﬁcation of the LOB. As is illustrated in the right panel of Figure 1 large market orders might lead to temporary extreme values of the CRT-measure distorting our measurement. We therefore use the mean over 15 minutes instead of CRTt(V ) at any ﬁxed time t. To this end, we consider a discrete form of the continuous time varying CRT-measure by considering averages over 15 minute intervals before time τ CRTτ (V ) = 1 15 ∫ τ τ −15 CRTt(V ) dt = 1 15 N∑ k=2 CRTtk (V ) + CRTtk−1 (V ) 2 (tk − tk−1), 12 where t1, . . . , tN are the N points in time where the LOB changes in the 15-minute time interval [τ − 15, τ ]. In the following, we use the index τ in CRTτ to refer to a 15-minute average and CRTt to refer to an instantaneous CRT at time t. The computed average thus reﬂects the expected CRT a trader would have to pay, if she picks a random trading time in the given time interval. The Italian intraday market has seven ﬁxed times when the market is cleared. We use clearing times of MI2 to MI7 to analyze the two markets, i.e., measure the CRT for the German markets at the times when the Italian markets are cleared. The reason for the exclusion of MI1 is that the German intraday auction closes nearly at the same time as MI1, which results in less liquidity on the continuous market at this point in time and thus a distortion. We compare the CRT of the remaining Italian intraday auctions with the mean German CRT over the 15 minutes before the closing of the Italian intraday auction. To this end, we deﬁne DI h as the closing times of the Italian intraday markets, where the hourly product h is traded. For example, DI 1 = {16 : 30} while DI 24 = {16 : 30, 23 : 45, 3 : 45, 7 : 45, 11 : 15, 15 : 45}, where the ﬁrst two time stamps are from the day before delivery. The German continuous intraday market allows participants to trade until 30 minutes before physical delivery on a national market. Hence, we will also compare the ﬁrst two 15-minute CRT- means within the last hour of the German continuous intraday market with the CRT-measure of the last available market of the Italian intraday auction for the corresponding product. Correspondingly, the points in time which we consider for the German market are DG h = DI h ∪ {h − 60, h − 45}. We generate observations corresponding to V = 0.1MWh, which is the smallest value that can be traded on the German intraday markets as well as for V = 5MWh, 10MWh, 15MWh and 50MWh. On some days the order book does not contain orders of combined size V on either the bid or the ask side at a time ti ∈ [τ − 15, τ ]. For our analysis, we calculate over 313 million clearings for the German market. In 0.0466% of these cases at least one side of the limit order book is empty and we exclude these timestamps in our calculation of the 15-minute intervals. In further 0.0804% of the cases not the whole quantity V is available on at least one side of the market. To deﬁne CRT for these cases, we use the last available price to clear the remaining quantity in order to calculate a CRT. 13 4.2. Analysis of the CRT In this section, we analyze the impact of the variables described in Section 3.2 on the CRTs of the two markets. To this end, we deﬁne an index J = (V, h, τ ) for every volume V , product h = 1, . . . , 24, and time to delivery τ ∈ DG h or τ ∈ DI h and construct the following linear regression models for Italy and Germany CRT G J = X G J βG J + ϵG J and CRT I J = X I J βI J + ϵI J , (2) where X G J = (XJ , C G J , H G J , RW,G J , F W,G J , RS,G J , F S,G J , RD,G J , F D,G J ) X I J = (XJ , C I J , H I J , RW,I J , F W,I J , RS,I J , F S,I J , RD,I J , F D,I J ), XJ = (1, WJ , DJ ) are the regressors that are market independent, and CRT G J and CRT I J are the CRTs of the German and Italian market, respectively. All regressors are standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The standardization helps to simplify the interpretation of the eﬀects of covariates with diﬀerent scales. We estimate the models in equation (2) separately, for every index J . This yields 420 models for the Italian intraday auction market, and 660 models for the German continuous intraday market, because we additionally analyze the two 15-minutes intervals shortly before physical delivery for the German market. For example, for h = 1, we compare the liquidity cost on the two 15-minute intervals that start 60 minutes and 45 minutes before physical delivery on the German market with the latest available intraday market in DI 1, i.e., MI2. 4.3. Double/Debiased Machine Learning In this section, we describe how we compare the impact of the two market designs on the CRT while controlling for the impact of confounding variables. In particular, we directly compare the CRT in the two markets while controlling for linear and non-linear eﬀects of the regressors introduced in Section 3.2. For this purpose, for every volume V , product h, and every trading time τ ∈ DG h , we combine the data on CRT G J and CRT I J into a combined CRT C J by stacking the two vectors on top of each other. For τ ∈ DG h \\ DI h, we use the CRTs of the corresponding last market where the hour was traded on an Italian intraday market. 14 We then deﬁne a sparse matrix X C J =   XJ X G J 0 XJ 0 X I J   by padding market speciﬁc observations with zeros. We compute all quadratic interactions to capture non-linear eﬀects obtaining  Y F J Y G J 0 0 Y I J   , where Y G J and Y I J consist of interactions that contain a market speciﬁc variable for Germany and Italy, respectively, while Y F J contains interactions of variables in XJ . Next, we delete all columns with fewer than 10 observations diﬀerent from zero. We then replace the zeros of the sparse submatrices with the corresponding mean to obtain  Y F J Y G J ¯Y I J ¯Y G J Y I J   . (3) We standardize (3) by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation and denote the resulting matrix by Y C J . Note that replacing the zeros by the respective means in (3) ensures that there is no variable in Y C J , which has a diﬀerent mean for the subset for Italian and German observations. We introduce a dummy variable G that takes the value 1 for CRT values from the German market and 0 for data from the Italian market. Using these regressors, we specify a combined linear model CRT C J = αJ GJ + Y C J βC J + ϵJ , (4) which is able to control for interactions between the variables and non-linear eﬀects. Moreover, all regressors have mean zero and the introduced dummy variable GJ is the only available variable to describe the systematic diﬀerences in CRTs between the two countries. Our aim is to obtain consistent estimates of the eﬀect of the market design αJ as well as conﬁdence intervals. Equation (4) has many regressors and we are no longer able to apply OLS due to overﬁtting. Hence, we would have to select a subset of regressors using a model selection mechanism and then estimate the coeﬃcient α from the reduced model. However, as pointed out by Leeb and P¨otscher (2005), model selection distorts inference and especially small parameters 15 cannot be estimated consistently. Additionally, the same data set would be used twice: the ﬁrst time for model selection and the second time to estimate αJ and its p-value in the resulting regression. Another naive method would be to estimate the model (4) using a LASSO regression and directly analyze αJ . However, the resulting estimates are biased due to the L1-regularization term introduced in LASSO. In order to avoid biased estimates for αJ , we use a double machine learning procedure by Chernozhukov et al. (2018) as implemented in STATA. The method uses Neyman-orthogonal mo- ments/scores to eliminate the regularization bias and cross-ﬁtting to eliminate the bias resulting from over-ﬁtting of nuisance functions. In particular, we use LASSO regression for model selection in (4) where the penalty parameter is chosen using 10-fold cross validation. We resample 10 times for the calculation of an unbiased estimate ˜αJ for the parameter αJ in the selected models. We refer to StataCorpLLC (2019) for a detailed exposition of the method. 5. Results and Discussion In this section, we ﬁrst consider a descriptive analysis of CRT in Section 5.1. In Section 5.2, we construct two linear regression models to analyze the impact of confounding variables on the liquidity costs of the two markets. Finally, we analyze the diﬀerence of the two market designs using double-machine learning in Section 5.3. 5.1. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis of CRT The descriptive statistics of the CRT-measures are summarized in Table 4. The ﬁrst panel reports the average CRTs as measured at the points in time DI h and DG h which we use in our comparisons between the markets. However, since trading in the German continuous intraday market occurs mostly within the last three hours before delivery, we also deﬁne a trading volume weighted CRT, which allows us to compare CRTs of a speciﬁc product over longer periods of time as CRTV,h = ∑ τ CRTV,h,τ Qh,τ∑ τ Qh,τ , where Qh,τ is the traded volume for product h and time to delivery τ . The above sum is over all quarter hours τ where a speciﬁc product h is traded. Similarly, when computing CRTV,h for the Italian markets, the cleared volumes for each auction market and the corresponding calculated CRTs are used. The results of these computations are reported in the lower panel of Table 4. 16 Subset N mean std min 25% 50% 75% max Average CRTs at DI h and DG h GER, 0.1MWh 27453 5.85 6.27 0.10 2.40 4.50 7.50 137.70 GER, 5MWh 27453 6.25 6.67 0.10 2.81 4.90 7.95 147.50 GER, 10MWh 27453 6.69 7.00 0.10 3.00 5.02 8.33 162.75 GER, 15MWh 27453 7.18 7.34 0.10 3.40 5.62 8.93 168.50 GER, 50MWh 27453 10.66 10.24 0.10 5.65 8.51 12.85 198.55 ITA, 0.1MWh 17471 1.26 1.72 0.01 0.25 0.72 1.59 27.63 ITA, 5MWh 17471 2.13 2.68 0.01 0.50 1.22 2.82 38.08 ITA, 10MWh 17471 2.74 3.29 0.01 0.67 1.72 3.60 46.79 ITA, 15MWh 17471 3.33 3.88 0.01 0.92 2.11 4.34 50.45 ITA, 50MWh 17471 6.45 6.65 0.01 2.18 4.50 8.26 63.47 Trading Volume Weighted CRTs GER, 0.1MWh 4991 1.99 1.23 0.55 1.24 1.64 2.34 14.32 GER, 5MWh 4991 2.20 1.33 0.62 1.40 1.83 2.60 24.31 GER, 10MWh 4991 2.38 1.42 0.72 1.54 1.99 2.79 35.52 GER, 15MWh 4991 2.56 1.49 0.81 1.69 2.17 3.00 39.55 GER, 50MWh 4991 3.90 2.09 1.32 2.67 3.37 4.52 58.61 ITA, 0.1MWh 4991 0.84 0.62 0.01 0.43 0.70 1.07 5.98 ITA, 5MWh 4991 1.36 0.93 0.01 0.73 1.15 1.75 8.29 ITA, 10MWh 4991 1.71 1.13 0.01 0.95 1.46 2.18 9.49 ITA, 15MWh 4991 2.05 1.32 0.01 1.15 1.73 2.63 12.10 ITA, 50MWh 4991 3.84 2.35 0.01 2.21 3.32 4.84 21.25 Table 4: Descriptive statistics of CRT-measures and traded-volumes CRT-measures from 17.11.2017 to 15.06.2018. The analysis reveals that the CRT for all volumes is higher for the German market on average for both ways of measurement. Comparing the maxima of the distributions, we observe that the corresponding CRTs for the German market far exceed the maximal CRTs observed in the Italian markets. However, the results for the averages are not entirely driven by the right tail of the distribution as the analysis of the other quantiles reveals. Another interesting observation is that while the CRT for the Italian market increases sharply with V , this eﬀect is much less pronounced on the German market, where costs are high even for small volumes due to the bid-ask spread on the German market. The univariate analysis along the dimension volume does not capture changes with the time to 17 Figure 2: Boxplots of CRTs grouped by trading time and volume. delivery. Hence, we show the dependence of the results on the time to delivery in the boxplots in Figure 2 for the CRTs calculated at DI h and DG h . We note that liquidity costs on the Italian market are low during the ﬁrst two auction markets, and are relatively high for the MI4 and MI7. The German CRTs decrease towards one hour before physical delivery and increase afterwards – this L-shape was also observed in Balardy (2018). 5.2. Eﬀects in the Individual Markets In this section, we analyze the eﬀect of the explanatory variables X I and X G as introduced in Section 4.2 on the CRT in the respective markets. In order to do so, we ﬁt the linear regression models (2) using the ﬁtlm function as implemented in MATLAB R2017a. We consider the same data-set as used in the previous section grouped by volume, product, and time to delivery. We consider a regressor to be signiﬁcant in a regression, if its p-value is smaller than 0.05 and order the regressors according to the number of models that they are signiﬁcant in. The upper row of plots in Figure 3 shows the distribution of coeﬃcients of the four regressors which are most often signiﬁcant in the estimated models for the Italian market. The lower four plots repeat this analysis 18 CI (64) -2 0 2 4 6 0 5 10 15 D (57) -5 0 5 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 WSun (55) -20 -10 0 10 20 0 5 10 15 RD,I (40) -10 -5 0 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 D (371) -10 -5 0 5 0 20 40 60 80 FD,G (244) -15 -10 -5 0 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 WSun (243) -20 -10 0 10 0 10 20 30 40 WSat (239) -15 -10 -5 0 5 0 10 20 30 40 Figure 3: Distribution of the top 4 signiﬁcant estimates of the selected controls of Italy (above) and Germany (below). The x-axis of the plots represents the values of the estimated coeﬃcients. for the German market. For Germany, the most important regressor is the seasonality Dt modeled as the length of daylight, which has a signiﬁcant positive impact in 371 out of 660 models. As the estimated coeﬃcients are unambiguously negative, this implies lower liquidity costs in summers. The next most signiﬁcant regressor is the forecast demand F D,G, which is signiﬁcant in 244 models and has also a clearly negative coeﬃcient implying that higher (forecast) demands lead to more trading, which in turn decreases liquidity costs. The last two depicted regressors are the dummies for Sundays and Saturdays which are signif- icant in 243 and 239 models, respectively. On a ﬁrst glance, the negative signs of the estimated regressors might seem surprising, since there is less trading on the weekend lowering liquidity costs. However, this eﬀect is already captured by the regressor F D,G so that the weekend dummies only measure the weekly patterns which do not directly depend on demand. The dummies for Saturday and Sunday, thus allow for a more moderate increase in liquidity costs on these days as would be modeled by the eﬀect of lower demand alone. 19 By and large the German market shows clear eﬀects and the corresponding regressors are sig- niﬁcant in many of the considered models, which underlines the importance of considering these variables as controls when we measure the eﬀect of market design on liquidity costs in Section 4.3. The situation for the Italian models is not nearly as clear cut. Generally speaking, the proposed regressors are signiﬁcant much less often and the signs are more ambiguous making easy explanations of the results harder. This is in line with Hagemann and Weber (2015), who ﬁnd that the trading volume on the Italian auction market cannot be explained very well by fundamental variables. The most important regressor for the Italian market is cooling C I which signiﬁcantly aﬀects liquidity in 64 out of 420 models for the Italian market with a mostly positive sign implying that the increased demand by air-conditioning, which is widely used in Italy, leads to a positive impact on liquidity cost on hot days. The length of daylight DI , which is signiﬁcant in 57 models is the second most important regressor in Italy. As the ﬁgure shows, the estimated coeﬃcients are mostly positive indicating a positive impact of the length of daylight on the CRT. This implies a seasonal eﬀect with higher liquidity cost in summers. This is in contrast to the German situation, where the eﬀect on the seasonal variable is reversed. The Sunday dummy is signiﬁcant in 55 models. The sign of the regressor is rather ambiguous and hard to interpret, since, similar to the German market, there is an interaction with the realized demand, which is also contained among the top 4 regressors. Lastly, the realized demand RD,I t aﬀects the CRT on the Italian market signiﬁcantly in 40 models, where it mostly has a negative eﬀect on the CRT. 5.3. Comparison of Market Designs Our aim in this section is to analyze the diﬀerence of the CRTs of the two markets controlling the eﬀect of confounding variables. For that purpose, we use the function xporegress of STATA StataCorpLLC (2019) to estimate the models presented in Section 4.3. The output of our analysis is an estimate, a valid conﬁdence interval, and the corresponding p-value for the parameter α in model (4). Table 5 summarizes the results in form of a heatmap showing estimates and p-values. The columns indicate diﬀerent hourly products, while the rows indicate time to delivery. To distinguish between the diﬀerent quantities V , we divide the table into ﬁve panels. 20 We compare CRTs for products with the same time to delivery, and the CRTs for the two 15 minutes intervals on the German continuous intraday market before delivery of a speciﬁc product with the last auction market in Italy where the corresponding product is traded. Cells marked grey indicate products that can not be compared, since they are no longer traded on the Italian market. A cell is colored red if the estimate for αJ in the corresponding model is positive, i.e., the CRT in the Italian market is lower than in the German market. Analogously, cells are colored blue if αJ is negative. The intensity of the color reﬂects the magnitude of the p-value with more intense coloring for lower p-values, i.e., more signiﬁcant results as indicated in the color map in the last row of the table. As expected from the univariate results in Section 5.1, the majority of cells are red indicating higher cost of liquidity on the German market. Comparing the overall results of the ﬁve diﬀerent panels, this eﬀect weakens for higher volumes V , indicating that the German market is relatively less aﬀected by large volume bids as can also be seen in Figure 2. Observing the ﬁrst rows of the ﬁve panels, it becomes clear that there is a strong inﬂuence of the time to delivery on the estimated parameter αJ . In particular, the Italian market has clearly lower liquidity cost at the time of clearing of the ﬁrst two Italian intraday markets for all volumes V . However, looking at single columns corresponding to products h = 1, . . . , 24, this eﬀect weakens as trading times move closer to delivery. These results are consistent with the analysis in Figure 2 and the fact that traded volumes tend to decrease for later Italian auction markets, while the German market is most active close to delivery. The last two rows of every panel compare the ﬁrst two 15-minutes intervals in the last hours before delivery in the German market with the last Italian auction market where the respective hour can be traded. In these 15-minute intervals the German market reaches its highest liquidity and exhibits signiﬁcantly lower liquidity cost as the Italian markets, except for small volumes. In summary, the German market gets relatively more liquid towards physical delivery, with higher liquidity in the German market close to delivery and for larger volumes V .

Looking at the ﬁrst non-gray blocks in every row corresponding to MI3-MI7, i.e., the hours that can be traded the last time on an Italian market, we observe that liquidity cost on the Italian market is higher than on the German market.

Apparently, the high CRTs are thus a consequence of tight market situations caused by either large demands or large free production capacities ﬂooding the market for low prices. 6. Conclusions and Policy Implications This article explores liquidity costs of the German continuous intraday market and the Italian auction-based intraday market. For that purpose, we introduce a cost-of-round-trip measure to analyze liquidity costs. Grouping the data of each market by volume and trading time, we compare cost of liquidity in the two markets using descriptive statistics. Secondly, we analyze the impact of several explanatory variables on the two markets separately. Thirdly, we compare the two market designs by controlling the impact of the confounding variables. We ﬁnd that liquidity costs are generally lower in the Italian auction market, whereby the diﬀerence tends to decrease with the traded quantity of power and as trading gets closer to physical delivery. The latter ﬁnding is consistent with the L-shape of the German bid-ask spread observed by Balardy (2018). Our results show that the cost of liquidity in both countries is inﬂuenced by weekly and yearly seasonalities, temperatures via cooling demand, and the overall demand for electricity. Our study has some limitations. Firstly, the German market provides the possibility to place iceberg orders, i.e., orders where the full volume is not visible but gets revealed gradually as parts of the order are cleared. The existence of a signiﬁcant amount of these invisible orders might lead us to underestimate the liquidity and correspondingly overestimate the CRT on the German market. Secondly, the CRT on the Italian intraday auction markets might be higher due to zonal prices in Italy in auctions where there is congestion of transmission lines between market zones. Our analysis suggests that a hybrid system might leverage the advantages of both market designs and decrease liquidity costs on intraday markets (Bellenbaum et al., 2014; Ehrenmann et al., 2019; Ocker and Jaenisch, 2020). In particular, auction markets for hours far from delivery might help to increase liquidity by pooling orders, while continuous intraday markets starting close to delivery would be an optimal tool to integrate forecast errors for the output from variable renewables shortly before physical delivery. A similar design was recently introduced for the Spanish intraday market and it is planned for the Italian market as well. Alternatively, one could use a system of frequent 23 batch auctions as proposed in Budish et al. (2015); Deutsche B¨orse Group (2018) to combine the advantages of continuous trading and auctions.
