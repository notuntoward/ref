You may elect to: 1) receive this distribution in cash; or 2) roll over the distribution to an individual retirement account (IRA) or the qualified plan of your new employer (but only if your new employer's plan allows such rollovers). However, if you do not timely return your election forms, the following will apply: • if the vested amount of your Account balance is less than or equal to $1,000, your vested Account will be distributed to you in cash; • if your vested Account balance is more than $1,000, but does not exceed $7,000, the Plan Administrator will transfer your vested Account to an IRA established in your name. This mandatory distribution will be invested in an IRA designed to preserve principal and provide a reasonable rate of return and liquidity. All fees and expenses incurred after the IRA is established will be deducted from the IRA. For further information concerning the Plan's automatic rollover provisions, the IRA provider and the fees and expenses attendant to the individual retirement plan please contact the Plan Administrator at hqct-hr@qcells.com. If the vested amount of your Account exceeds $7,000, you must consent to any distribution of your Account. You may request distribution or direct rollover to another retirement plan by logging onto your portal and requesting the distribution.
