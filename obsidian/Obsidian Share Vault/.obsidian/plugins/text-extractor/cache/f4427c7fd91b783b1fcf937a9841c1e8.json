The crux of this construction is that knot-sets for simplex B-splines are selected by considering groups of “nearby” knots. The new approach gives rise to a natural general- ization of univariate splines in that the linear span of this collection of B-splines forms a space which is analogous to the classical univariate splines. This new spline space depends uniquely and in a local way on the prescribed knot locations, and there is no need to use auxiliary or perturbed knots as in some earlier constructions. 1. Simplex B-Splines The classical univariate splines are a standard tool in computer-aided geometric design, modeling of curves and surfaces, and in a host of other areas in applied mathe- matics and engineering. These splines owe their attrac- tiveness mainly to their piecewise polynomial and local na- ture, which is exempliﬁed by the existence of a local basis for univariate splines, the well-known B-spline basis. B- splines are natural “geometric objects” in that they can be viewed as “shadows” or volumetric projections of higher- dimensional simplices. This interpretation of B-splines is a classical result obtained by I. J. Schoenberg, the founder of the spline theory, and his collaborator, in the famous pa- per [3]. Figure 1 shows the idea of the geometric interpre- tation, by which a quadratic B-spline with four knots\u0000\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0005\u0004\u0007\u0006\t\b \u0004\f\u000b\r\b \u0004\u000f\u000e\t\b\u0010\u0004\u0007\u0011\u0013\u0012is deﬁned by slicing a three-dimensional simplex\u0014with planes perpendicular to the real line, and then “projecting” the areas of the obtained cross-sections onto this line. In this way one can get B-splines of arbi- trary degree\u0015and for arbitrary knots, by taking an appro- priate simplex in the (\u0015\u0017\u0016ˇ˘)-dimensional Euclidean space and volumetrically projecting it ontoˆ˙\u000b. The above geometric interpretation generated much ex-˝1˝0 IR ˛σ˚˜˝ !\"˝IR #˝3˝2 Figure 1.

As a result, C. de Boor [1] deﬁned multivariate B-splines of degree\u0015. In the bivariate case, this deﬁnition reads&('\u0004*)\u0000,+.-/\u0001vol0\u0014213545ˆ˙076\u000e\b3)89;:\u0001\u0004 σMNOPQRO IR S IR TO 0O1O3O2 Figure 2.

Since there is no natural ordering in the Euclidean plane, it should not come as a surprise that the problem of choosing appropriate collections of knots is far from trivial. This problem can be stated more precisely as follows. Sup- pose thatzis a collection of knots in the plane (ﬁnite or inﬁnite). Can we choose a collection⁄of knot-sets\u0000>~zof size\u0015‹\u0016‹=such that the linear span of the associated B- splines of degree\u0015,›0-`\u0001span\u0003&F'}V)\u0000,+)\u00004−⁄\u0012J\b gives rise to a useful space of splines in the plane? Formu- lated more rigorously,⁄should be large enough so that›0would contain (at least locally) all polynomials of degree\u0015. Thus, in particular, using this spline space we must be able to reconstruct constant functions, which is a reasonable re- quirement. (A deeper reason for the need of a space that reproduces polynomials of a given degree is that this de- gree directly determines the degree of approximation of›0, see [2, 4]). At the same time, however, there is the contra- dictory requirement that the collection⁄should not be too large. Namely, the B-splines&F'}V)\u0000,+\b\u00004‰⁄, must have “small” supports. This is why it is not acceptable to deﬁne⁄as the collection of all knot-sets\u0000>~zof size\u0015„\u00162=, for then too many B-splines would overlap. One reason for the initial optimism sparked by the ge- ometric deﬁnition (1) of B-splines was that this deﬁnition also immediately gives a recipe for selecting collections⁄. For example, in the quadratic case, one can take the four- dimensional “slab” of the formˆ˙\u000eC“\\”>‘ˆ˙‚’, where” is a two-dimensional convex polygon (such as a 2-simplex) and triangulate it, i.e., decompose it into four-dimensional simplices. These simplices give rise to a collection of B- splines whose linear span automatically reproduces con- stants. This is because the volumetric projection of the above slab (which is the union of the mentioned simplices) is obviously the constant function with value vol\u000e'”+, the area of”. In fact, one can even show that by this con- struction, the space›0will contain, next to constants, all polynomials of degree\u0015. However, despite the apparent beauty of the above idea, the above approach was soon abandoned. This is be- cause constructing bivariate splines by triangulating four or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1112 13 14 1516 1718 19 20 Figure 5. Voronoi diagram of a set of points. higher-dimensional polyhedra did not seem appealing, nor very practical. Therefore, other ways of obtaining appro- priate collections⁄were proposed, the most recent one of which was given in [5]. Unfortunately, all these construc- tions suffer from various shortcomings that are not encoun- tered in the univariate situation. For example, in the state- of-the-art construction of [5], not all knots are “equal” in the sense that, next to the original knotsz, certain auxil- iary knots need to be chosen before one can proceed with the actual construction of the spline space. This complica- tion may explain why simplex splines have so far not gained a wide popularity amongst applied mathematicians. We re- fer the reader to the survey [8], for a detailed discussion of the various issues related to the construction of simplex spline spaces. Below, we describe a new construction of spline spaces, which does not require the introduction of auxiliary knots, and which nevertheless still exhibits several desirable prop- erties. 2. Voronoi Diagrams and Delaunay Triangula- tions Letzbe a set of points in the plane. The Voronoi di- agram ofzis deﬁned as the partition ofˆ˙\u000einto subsets that are closest to one of the points inz. Thus, for each\u00044™zthere is a closed set†ƒ'\u0004+>‡ˆ˙\u000e, called a Voronoi cell, such that the distance of everyt4†ƒ'\u0004+from\u0004is less than or equal the distance oftfrom any other point in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1112 13 14 1516 1718 19 20 Figure 6. Delaunay triangulation.z. Voronoi cells are known to be polygonal, i.e., intersec- tions of ﬁnitely many closed half-planes. Figure 5 shows the Voronoi diagram of a set of points in the plane. Voronoi diagrams belong to standard tools in many areas of mathe- matics and computational geometry. For more on Voronoi diagrams, we refer the reader to [10, 14]. Equally well known is the dual graph of the Voronoi dia- gram, obtained by connecting two points fromzby an edge if their associated Voronoi cells are neighbors, i.e., share a common edge. In his 1934 paper [6], B. N. Delaunay proved that this dual graph of the Voronoi diagram is a tri- angulation of the convex hull]ﬁz^, now called the Delaunay triangulation. The Delaunay triangulation corresponding to the point-set from Figure 5 is displayed in Figure 6. Delaunay triangulations have numerous applications. Some of these are in the ﬁnite element method and in computer-aided geometric design, where the triangulation is a useful way of partitioning the domain of interest. Note that for a given setzthere are many ways of triangulating it. One reason for the popularity of the Delaunay triangu- lation is that it is known to maximize the minimal angle of the triangles. This property is crucial in many applica- tions since the occurrence of “long” and “thin” triangles in a triangulation often has unwanted consequences. We refer to [12], for a survey of triangulation methods. For our purposes here it will be more appropriate to interpret Delaunay' s result in function-theoretic language. Namely, denoting the Delaunay triangulation byﬂ, this re- sult can be restated asŁpŠŒarea'`Ÿ2+ &F'\u0004n)/Ž'ıŸ(+}+*\u0001˘\bł\u00044%]ﬁz^\b(4) whereŽ'ıŸ(+are the vertices of a triangleŸinﬂ. This means that appropriate linear combinations of the lowest- degree B-splines, corresponding to the collection of knot- sets⁄\u0001\u0003JŽ'`Ÿ(+\bŸ4wﬂ\u0012q\b(5) reproduce constants. Strictly speaking, the above equality is true only for all\u0004in the interior of the triangles, but one can redeﬁne the lowest-degree B-splines on the boundaries of these triangles so as to achieve pointwise equality every- where on]ﬁz^. 3. Higher Order Voronoi Diagrams and Delau- nay Conﬁgurations Motivated by (4) and (5), the main idea of this paper can be explained as follows. Since the lowest-degree bivariate splines are obtained from Delaunay triangulations, it is con- ceivable that splines of degrees\u0015šœž˘can be generated using appropriate higher-degree analogs of such triangula- tions. This is indeed possible, as we shall see. Thus, our construction of splines, discussed below, can be viewed as a generalization of (4) to “higher degree Delaunay triangu- lations”, called here Delaunay conﬁgurations. Just as De- launay triangulations are related to Voronoi diagrams, De- launay conﬁgurations will be closely tied to the so-called higher order Voronoi diagrams, which we introduce ﬁrst. To keep our presentation simple, we will make several assumptions about the setz. First, the points inzwill be in generic position in the sense that no four of them are co- circular, i.e., lying on a common circle. A consequence of this requirement is that any given point inˆ˙\u000ecan belong to at most three Voronoi cells. This is equivalent to saying that the Delaunay triangulationﬂis deﬁned uniquely forz. The second assumption onzwill be thatzis inﬁnite and such that]ﬁz^2\u0001ˆ˙\u000e. Moreover, to avoid technical com- plications,zwe will be assumed to have no accumulation points, i.e.,zwill be such thatz‹1|gis ﬁnite for every com- pactg\u0000>€ˆ˙\u000e. These assumptions allow us to dispense with considering various special cases arising from non-generic knot-conﬁgurations and also from “boundary conditions” in the case of a boundedz. Higher order Voronoi diagrams have been introduced by Shamos and Hoey [16], as a tool in computational geometry (see also [10, 14]). The usefulness of these generalizations of Voronoi diagrams stems from the fact that they allow us to ﬁnd, for any given point\u000445ˆ˙\u000eand any numberD, a set ofDpoints fromzclosest to\u0004. The precise deﬁnition is as follows. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1112 13 14 1516 1718 19 20 Figure 7. Voronoi diagram of order two. Deﬁnition 1. The Voronoi diagram of orderDof the setzis the subdivision ofˆ˙\u000einto regions, called Voronoi cells (of degreeD), such that each cell contains the sameDnear- est points fromz. In particular, let\u0000>¡zbe such that¢\u0000£\u0001D, where¢\u0000is the size of\u0000. The Voronoi cell†ƒ'`\u0000,+is deﬁned as†ƒ'`\u0000G+*-/\u0001\u0003\u0005\u00044wˆ˙\u000e)H\u0013'\u0004x\b\u0000G+n¤ˇH¥'\u0004n\b…¦+\b…¦>~z\b¢¦\u0001D\u0012J\b whereH¥'\u0004n\b…¦+2-/\u0001¡§(¨q©oJpyª<«\u0004%¬<t«, and«V«is the Eu- clidean norm. Note that typically many Voronoi cells will be empty sets. Voronoi diagrams of order one reduce to the usual Voronoi diagrams. Just as for the ordinary diagrams, the cells†ƒ'`\u0000,+are convex polygonal sets. Figures 7 and 8 show the Voronoi diagrams of orders two and three, respectively, for the point-set from Figure 5. Higher order Voronoi diagrams have been suggested in connection with the construction of collections of knot-sets for bivariate quadratic B-splines by M. Sabin in [15]. While his idea does not lead to appropriate spline spaces, see [8], higher order Voronoi diagrams are intimately related to the already mentioned Delaunay conﬁgurations, which turn out to be better suited for the purpose of deﬁning splines. To motivate the deﬁnition of such conﬁgurations and to explain that they are indeed generalizations of the or- dinary Delaunay triangulations, let us consider the partic- ular higher order Voronoi diagram of order two, displayed in Figure 9. The large-font pairs of numbers in some of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1112 13 14 1516 1718 19 20 Figure 8. Voronoi diagram of order three. the Voronoi cells represent the pairs of knots associated to a given cell. Thus, for example, the cell marked as 7–16 consists of all points in the plane that are closer to knots\u0000and˘\r®than to any other pair from the given set. To explain the idea behind Delaunay conﬁgurations, let us recall that a Voronoi vertex is a point in the plane which is common to exactly three Voronoi cells (recall that by our assumption, there are no points belonging to four or more Voronoi cells). It is not difﬁcult to see that every Voronoi vertex is the in- center of a circle circumscribed to triples of knots. In fact, there are precisely two types of such vertices, depicted in the ﬁgure. The ﬁrst type corresponds to the Voronoi vertex common to cells 7–9,7–11,9–11, hence it is the center of the circle passing through knots\u0000\b°¯±\b˘\t˘. The second depicted Voronoi vertex is common to cells 7–9,7–11,7–16 and is the center of the circle passing through knots¯²\b˘q˘\b˘³®. The essential difference between these two types of vertices is that the ﬁrst mentioned circle contains no knots in its inte- rior, whereas the second circle contains one knot, namely the knot\u0000. Therefore, by a well-known fact about Delau- nay triangulations, in the ﬁrst case the triangle with vertices\u0000\b°¯±\b˘\t˘is a Delaunay triangle, while in the second case, the triangle with vertices¯²\b˘q˘\b˘³®is not a Delaunay trian- gle. The Delaunay triangle gives rise, as we mentioned ear- lier, to a B-spline of degree zero (a constant B-spline). On the other hand, the quadruple'\u0000\b°¯±\b˘q˘\b˘\r®+corresponds to a (linear) B-spline of degree one. This quadruple will be called a Delaunay conﬁguration of degree one (“one” refers to the number of knots inside the circle circumscribed to 7-9 7-11 7-16 7-15 7-8 9-11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1112 13 14 15 16 1718 19 20 Figure 9.

We shall see that B-splines corresponding to such collections will give rise to a spline space with several striking proper- ties. The above discussion motivates the following deﬁnition. Deﬁnition 2.

Before we embark on discussing the relevance of the above notion for constructing bivariate splines, a few re- marks on Deﬁnition 2 will be in order.

Delaunay conﬁguration seems to be new. Although it is im- plicit in several papers on higher order Voronoi diagrams, see e.g., [17], it does not seem to have been studied as a separate entity. It is immediately clear from the well-known properties of Delaunay triangulations that these are Delau- nay conﬁgurations of degree\u0015\u0001LK, i.e.,ﬂ\u0006\u0001ﬂ. It should be noted that Delaunay conﬁgurations for\u0015šœž˘do not form a partition ofˆ˙\u000ei.e., a higher degree Delaunay con- ﬁguration is not a tessellation. Clearly, for every\u0000, the sets\u0000µand\u0000¶are disjoint. In our notation, “&” stands for “boundary” and “À” for “interior” knots. Finally, some Delaunay conﬁgurations may be different as pairs and yet the same as sets, for there could be two different conﬁgura- tions'`\u0000\u000bµ\b\u0000\u000b¶+and'`\u0000\u000eµ\b\u0000\u000e¶+, corresponding to the same set of points, i.e.,\u0000\u000bµ¹\u0000\u000b¶\u0001G\u0000\u000eµ¹\u0000\u000e¶, but\u0000\u000bµ¡Á\u0001–\u0000\u000eµ,\u0000\u000b¶‹Á\u0001<\u0000\u000e¶. However, it will be important to treat such con- ﬁgurations as different. 4. Partition of Unity and Reproduction of Poly- nomials We now return to the central issue of this paper and present a construction of appropriate collections⁄of knots-sets, along with the accompanying simplex spline spaces›0. First note that a Delaunay conﬁguration of degree\u0015is a collection of knot-sets of size\u0015L\u0016L=. This suggests thatÂÃÂÄ Figure 11.

The area of the convex hull of boundary knots enters the normalizing factor in (7). we deﬁne›0as the space spanned by the simplex B-splines whose knot-sets are precisely the Delaunay conﬁgurations corresponding to a given set of knotsz. As we have pointed out earlier, this certainly makes sense in the lowest- degree case\u0015\u0001EK, since then›\u0006contains constant func- tions, as a consequence of (4). In fact, this property carries over to all degrees\u0015. To formulate the above more precisely, let us ﬁrst re- call some helpful facts about polar forms of polynomials. The concept of a polar form or “blossom”, while known for quite some time in an algebraic context, has been in- troduced into the spline theory by de Casteljau and in- dependently by Ramshaw (see [11], for an introduction). Polar forms have proven to be a convenient mathematical tool for describing (piecewise) polynomial functions and for analyzing various spline algorithms. Given a bivariate polynomialÆof degree at most\u0015, the polar formÇofÆis deﬁned as the unique function of\u0015vector variables\u0004\u000b\bI…IƒI\b \u000404‡ˆ˙\u000e, which is symmetric, afﬁne in each of these variables, and such thatÆis equal toÇon the diago- nal, i.e.,Ç'\u0004n\bIƒI…I\b\u0010\u0004+È\u0001Æ'\u0004+\b \u00044Lˆ˙\u000e. If\u0015\u0001‰K, then we deﬁneÇ-`\u0001Æ. We are now ready to state the announced result, that ev- ery polynomialÆw4−ÉC0can be expressed as a linear combi- nation of the B-splines whose knot-sets are Delaunay con- ﬁgurations of degree\u0015. Here, as usual,ÉÈ0stands for the space of all bivariate polynomials of (total) degree at most\u0015. Theorem 1. LetÆ%4<É0and letÇbe the polar form ofÆ.

Concluding Remarks To better appreciate the above results, it will be use- ful to compare identities (6) and (7) with their univariate counterparts.
