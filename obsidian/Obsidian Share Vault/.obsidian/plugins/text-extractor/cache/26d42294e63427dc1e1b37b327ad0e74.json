Since members of a project include the project leader their sum in a project can never be less than 1. Members = 1 project leader + X project partners Partner The term “partner” will be used indicating a second, third, fourth etc. institution within a collaborative project. The project leader of a project therefore is never included in the number of partners, but instead in the number of members. Partners = All institutions working in a project except the project leader. Non-unique members/institutions vs. unique members/institutions “Non-unique” will be a used to refer to the fact that the same organization can carry out, for instance, two projects and will be counted twice in this case. “Unique” will refer to an individual institution, e.g. University of Kassel is a unique institution. If two departments of the same unique institution participate in a project, this is counted as one member in the case of unique institutions, and twice in the case of non-unique institutions. Statistical units (Merkmalsträger bzw. Untersuchungseinheit; e.g. a person or organization, groups of things, regions, events etc.) are units that carry certain information or features that are of interest within an empirical investigation. The statistical units in this thesis are the individual publically funded wind energy research projects carried out in Germany between 1975 and 2013 (2013 only partly). Statistical mass (population; Grundgesamtheit (bestehend aus der Zusammenfassung aller Untersuchungseinheiten), z.B. die Bevölkerung, alle Unternehmen eines Wirtschaftszweiges, ) is the synopsis (summary) of all statistical units. The statistical mass in this thesis is the sum (1370) of all publically funded wind energy research projects carried out in Germany between 1975 and 2013. It could be called the wind energy research project landscape.

Also, the data was downloadable. A call with the administrator of the database ensured that I would receive complete and original data of all wind energy related R&D projects contained in the database. The FJEE comprised a much smaller time frame (2007-2013) and was not downloadable, and the database of the government (Förderportal) did not list project members. Data volume, first description and data weaknesses The UFORDAT database administrator delivered 1370 research projects (Status March 2013) that conducted R&D activities in the area of wind power between 1975 and 2013 (2013 only partly). Information on the following aspects is available: Project number and title Name of the project leader Name of the funding institution(s) Funding sum Funding currency (Euro, DM, Swiss Franc CHF, Austrian Schilling OES) Start and end date of the project Brief project topic description Catchwords describing the project Names of the cooperating partners A look at the contents of the spreadsheet revealed that data unfortunately was not complete for all projects. Also, 17 projects had nothing to do with wind energy and were deleted, leaving 1353 projects for analysis. For an additional 74 projects there was no start date given, and for another 26, there was no end date in the data. When this was the case, features could not be associated with a year and were therefore dropped out of such calculations or figures. Where there is no correlation made to a year, all projects are included. For 426 projects no funding sum was given. This is a huge part of the available projects. However, for those projects the cooperating partners were given. Complete data, therefore, was available for 927 projects. The first weakness of the data used in this thesis therefore is that analysis regarding the cooperation between partners can be done with 1353 projects, but analysis where funding sums come into play (including the modelling), can only be made with 927 projects. In order to use as much project data, we used the 927 project set only when funding information was needed. Project members are either German institutions or from other European countries. Projects in the database are funded by different institutions: either by the German government through its ministries (BMU, BMBF, BMWi etc.) or by the Länder, by the European Union (EU) or other public and private funding institutions. A project can be funded by more than one funder. Where this is the case, the proportion of the funding sum paid by each of the funders is not available. This is the second weakness of the data but affects only XX projects. When analyzing funder specific expenses, the complete funding sum of the respective project was assigned to each of its funders. However, there are other constraints and limits to the UFORDAT data: The UBA collects the information from the project leaders directly once a project has started. The result is that neither can be guaranteed that the number of projects carried out be complete, nor that the information about the individual projects be complete and consistent (third weakness). Also, there is no difference made regarding the contractual agreement between the cooperating institutions (fourth weakness): This means that, in the case of a joint project, we do not know whether collaborators are subcontractors or joint project partners (‘Verbundpartner’). A joint project comprises two or more sub-projects with similar topics or targets (‘Verbundprojekt’), each of them having their own project leader, their own funding and, if applicable additional partners. A joint project usually has a coordinator that is responsible to coordinate collaboration among the sub-projects. The coordinator was not available and therefore is not coded. Sub-projects will be treated like individual projects but have additional partners, namely the project leaders of the other sub-projects of the joint project. A project leader was added as an additional partner to the sub-project only if it was not mentioned as a partner of the sub-project already to avoid double counting. There are 258 joint projects in the database in total. Since the data set has been collected over 39 years, a fifth weakness of the data is that consistency in names isn’t given. This affects not only names of the R&D executing institutions, but also names of funding institutions in terms of spelling errors, spelling differences, and the actual change of names (through mergers and acquisitions or, in the case of funders, through the change in competences). Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to check all data for plausibility and partly correct the data. For further analysis, data had to be categorized as well. What was done, how it was done, and what further weaknesses arise from that is described in the following Chapter (2.3). Preparation of data Name verification and correction, and institution clustering Due to spelling errors, spelling changes (abbreviations, suffixes, prefixes etc.), name inconsistencies (adding or omitting e.g. memberships) or other small differences in the names in the database, a verification or correction of all institution names including funding institutions had to be done, otherwise “R”, the programming language used for data processing and analysis, wouldn’t have been able to categorize and recognize data correctly. Additionally, to enable a certain comparisons between institutions and their cooperative behavior, the hierarchical levels of them had to be somewhat unified. Since, in the framework of this thesis, it was impossible to check the number of employees for each of the institutions, the selection of hierarchies was done according to the availability of data and according to the number of sub-entities of each institution. In the case of companies, affiliations and departments etc. were discarded, and the institution was coded simply by the company name. For universities, the institutes of universities were kept as proper entities wherever the information was available, but departments or research groups were discarded. Where the information was not available, the university’s name was used for analysis. This affected mostly universities that occurred rarely, e.g. those conducting only one project. Also, old proper names were replaced by their new names, as long as it was the same institute (see as an example the bold printed lines in Table 1). In the case of PRO, such as Fraunhofer institutes, the institute is the hierarchy used (neither departments nor groups – mostly because this information was almost never available in the data). All original names were kept and connected to the corrected names so that traceability is possible. Table 1 shows examples of such name corrections.

Subsidiaries were aggregated under one mother company, university institutes were clustered under the name of the university and Fraunhofer institutes were clustered under the Fraunhofer society etc. Also, mergers and acquisitions –where it was known or traceable – were put together under one mother company. However, the clustering did not make a relevant difference in the outcome of analysis and therefore, was dismissed for further recognition in this thesis. Categorization of institutions according to types Furthermore, to each institution a type of organization was assigned. This is not easy and depends very much on what characteristic is actually of use to the analysis. The legal form itself is not object of interest in this thesis but rather the purpose of the organization. There are many types of organizations involved in wind energy research: partly or fully publically funded R&D organizations, foundations, private R&D service companies, non-profit organizations, universities, industrial enterprises, environmental groups, centers, associations, agencies etc. For a lot of them there was no clear information available in the data. Even a comprehensive internet based search for legal structure, funding background and purpose did not always answer the question of what type of organization the institution was. In such cases the type was assigned according to the purpose: If e.g. a foundation carried out lobbying activities for the industry and therefore the purpose was rather commercial it was put into the category “industry” – if its purpose was rather environmental protection or public awareness, it was put into the category “non-profit”. However, there are organizations that have been established, such as unions between industrial entities, and research funded by public and private money (private public partnerships PPP). In these cases, again, it was weighed whether the purpose of the institution was rather of commercial nature or research-oriented. The following list explains what categories were used. Table 2 Categories of organizations and description of categories and subcategories Category Organizations comprised by this category [subcategories if applicable] Uni (Technical) Universities Universities of applied sciences Other academic colleges PRO Non-academic R&D institutions with public institutional funding such as institutes of the Fraunhofer society [PRO-FHG], Max-Planck society [PRO-MP], Helmholtz society [PRO-HH] or Leibniz society [PRO-LB]. Research establishments whose sole shareholder is the public authorities (e.g. Deutsches BiomasseForschungsZentrum gemeinnützige GmbH or Forschungszentrum Jülich). Public private partnerships (PPP) that are mainly borne by state resources. Hybrids such as partly academic, partly non-academic institutions (e.g. Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Industry All companies Private R&D service companies Legally and financially independent institutes at Universities (e.g. ITAP, or Institut für Mechatronik e.V.). So-called “gGmbH” depending on their financial structure, members and clients (matter of weighting) Foundations associations and PPP that work industry- and technology-oriented (e.g. Zentrum für Sonnenenergie- und Wasserstoff-Forschung Baden-Württemberg) Other Associations, foundations or research organizations with a clear non-profit character that do not support a specific industrial sector (e.g. environmental organizations) [non-prof] Public authorities such as foundations for the promotion of science, facilities of the German armed forces, public R&D agencies, administrative bodies (e.g. DAAD, BAM, DBU, Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe e.V. (FNR)) [public authority] Public authorities, agencies, and administrative bodies from foreign countries (Universities, companies and PRO from other countries are in the respective category of the above mentioned) [foreign public bodies] Churches, schools, educational institutions, as well as organizations for which there could be found no information. [Other] The four categories within the category “Other” were first analyzed separately. The results of the separate analysis were not significant enough to further pursue the separate observation. Therefore, they were summarized into one category “OTHER”. Conversion of currencies and calculation of funding sums according to base year The change of currency within Europe in 2001 made it necessary to standardize funding data of projects according to one currency for which the Euro was chosen. . Next inflation was taken into account by converting funding amounts to 2010 Euros. For this, the consumer price index of the German federal bureau of statistics was used. The original consumer price index spreadsheet did contained neither the numbers for all years needed nor all of the numbers for the same base year (first, 1995 was used as base year, later they changed the base year to 2010), and so a very simplified method was adopted to extend the index to all of the years needed and to adjust it to one base year. Data pre-processing in perl and coding in R The original data spreadsheet, the name corrections, the funds re-calculations, the project topic clusters etc. were converted into a unified comma separated value file that was usable in ‘R’ – the computer programming language used for the analyses in this thesis. This was done by Herr Dr. Scott Otterson (SCO), a colleague at Fraunhofer IWES, with the computer programming language ‘perl’. SCO will be indicated at different times in the thesis as a source for code which was too sophisticated for me, being a beginner in using R. Preparation of data for the factor “TOPIC” Addressing the problem One factor affecting cooperation may be the topic or focus of a project. In the original UFORDAT database projects are categorized in two different ways: Environmental classes: describe, so that it’s clear why you can’t use them directly Keywords: describe Furthermore, the database also gives brief project descriptions (but not all of the projects) and titles of the projects A goal of this thesis was to determine if there was a relationship between project topics and cooperation: e.g. were there topical areas where more cooperation happens than in other areas? For this analysis, the projects had to be categorized in an objective, traceable and consistent way satisfying both, the topical complexity of one project on the one hand side and the abundance of projects that need to be categorized on the other hand side. This is most probably impossible for a human being. However, it is a task in itself that couldn’t be done in the framework of this thesis. Which topic would satisfy the broad multi-disciplinary R&D activities in a wind energy R&D project? And, if human judgment is not able to reduce the topical dimensions of a project to one only, what method would be able to do so? Latent semantic analysis PROJECT COOPERATION In this Chapter, a general overview of the 1353 R&D projects and the cooperative behavior within these projects is given. The projects have been carried out over the 39 years between 1975 and 2013. We can see in Figure 3 (black dots with support line) that the number of projects starting in a given year increased over time, from only four starting in 1975, to around 10-20 starting in in the 80’s, to over one hundred (104 exactly) starting in 2011. A strong increase of project starts from one year to the next can be seen in 1996 and from 2004 on. Figure 3 Quite similar is the picture of organizations in the R&D landscape that carry out these projects. Figure 4 shows both, the above shown number of projects as well as the total number of non-unique institutions active in a year (the year in which they are counted is the starting year of the project they are a member of). We can see that in the 70’s, 80’s and 90’s, up to 1996 there were between 4 and 52 non-unique organizations active every year. In 1996, this number suddenly rises to 159, then drops again, and starts increasing steadily from 2004 on, reaching its peak in 2011 with over 295 non-unique organizations. The two graphs look very similar. The correlation between the two variables is indeed very strong, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9872403. Figure 4 Since we are interested in collaboration, we would like to know how these members are spread across the above mentioned projects. As shown in Figure 5, 676 projects of a total of 1353 projects have at least two members and therefore are collaborative projects. 677 projects are carried out by one member alone (the project leader). This means that half of the investigated projects are collaborative. The number of projects categorized by their number of members is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 The amount of projects with two, three, four or five members is in a similar range. Projects with 6 or more members are quite rare (altogether 53 of 1353, a share of approx. 4%), and there are no projects with more than 11 members. Summing up all members, there has been a total of 3098 members, resulting in an average of approx. 2,3 members per project. Generally the number of projects decreases with the increasing of the number of members. Of the 676 collaborative projects approx. a third had two members (230 projects; ca. 17% of all, collaborative and non-collaborative projects). Ca. 60% had three, four or five members. The investigated collaborative projects have a total of 2422 members and ca. 3,6 members per project on average. It is important to note that the 676 members that were leaders of the above mentioned non-collaborative projects are not automatically non-collaborating institutions. The number of members mentioned here refers to the total number and not to individual institutions. The same institution (hereafter referred to as “unique”) can be a member in 10 projects (or any other number). Figure 6 Chaptershows how cooperation activity developed over time. The number of members per project is on the y-axis, and time is on the x-axis. The number of projects carried out with a specific number of members is shown in the form of blue bubbles whose size represents the number of projects. Figure 6 Cooperation over time We can clearly see the preponderance of non-collaborative projects (the lowest row of bubbles) and a clear increase of projects in general as well as of projects with a higher number of members over time. Particularly starting from 2004, and again from 2009, the number of collaborative projects, and especially projects with five members, rises. It is not possible to spot a pattern for projects with higher number of members than five, but we can see that they started to exist from the mid-nineties on. The weighted average is displayed by the black dots (with support line) which summarizes the upward trend of number of members. The question arising from this is what factors influenced this cooperation trend? Since we are looking at publically funded work, the first reason one would think of is public money: More money for collaborators and less for loners could trigger cooperation;the first factor that will be analyzed is funding. THE MONEY FACTOR First of all, a general idea about the amount of funding and the recipients will be given. As mentioned in Chapter 2.1, funding data is available only for 927 projects of 1353 projects. The total amount of funds spent on the 927 wind energy R&D projects is ca. 790 million Euros. In 39 years, collaborative projects received a total of ca. 364 million Euros, non-collaborative projects a total of ca. 425 million Euros. The mean funding for a project is ca. 850.000 Euros while the median is ca. 290.000 Euros. The mean for a collaborative project is ca. 740.000 Euros and the mean for a non-collaborative project is ca. 980.000 Euros. The histogram in Figure 7 shows how the funds (in T€) are distributed over the 927 projects. Figure 7 Histogram of project funding (927 projects) The vast majority of the projects was funded with up to 500.000 Euros. 138 projects were funded with up to one million Euros, and 144 projects received up to 5 million Euros. There are a few projects that stick out of the mass: 21 projects received up to ten million Euros, and 7 projects even more. With approx. 53 million Euros, the most “expensive” project was the 8-years-long GROWIAN project in the 80’s and 90’s which included the whole process from the planning, up to the construction and operation of a big wind turbine called “GROWIAN”. Figure 8 shows the number of, and the funds for, collaborative and non-collaborative projects over time. More exactly, it shows the relative funding amount and the relative project number per project size (in terms of number of members in a project). The volume of the red bubbles indicates the relative number of projects with n members (y-axis) in a year (x-axis). The volume of the hollow black circles indicates the relative funding for projects with n members (y-axis) in a year(x-axis). Figure 8: Cooperation and cooperation funds over time The number of both, collaborative and non-collaborative projects (the volume of the red circles) increases over time. Collaborative projects, particularly up to five members, increase strongly from 2003/2004 on. The relative (visible) size difference between the number of projects and their funds is particularly low for projects before 1985. After that, the black circle is almost always smaller than the red bubble. E.g. the large black circle in 2011 portrays that projects with one member in 2011 received more funding on average than such projects in the years 2007-2009. In summary, the total amount of funds increase over time, and more money in total was spent for collaborative projects. When comparing multi-member projects to single-member projects, it is interesting to see that the size of the black funding circles compared to the red bubbles stays roughly the same. This implies that a multi-member project received on average the same amount of money as a project with fewer members even though it had more members. Therefore, the average member of a multi-member project received less money than those in a project with fewer members. Or in other words, Euros per member decrease with the number of members in the project, as if projects tend to be given a fixed amount of money regardless of number of members. To get a better idea we have to ask how these amounts are spread among cooperative and non-cooperative projects. Figure 9 (with a support line) shows the temporal development of the total yearly amount of money, and Figure 10 of the mean funding sum, for both collaborative vs. non-collaborative projects. There were no collaborative projects in 1980 and 1983 which is why there are no dots printed and the line is interrupted. We recognize the huge GROWIAN project funding in 1979. Furthermore, we can detect that, until the year 2000, more money on average went into single-member-projects than into collaborative projects, with some exceptions (1978, 1981, 1985, and 1994). Starting from 2001, the overall total funding increased for both project categories, but it seems that collaborative projects were given preference. Figure 10 is quite important: In Figure 9 we get the impression that total funding increased, which is true. However, the funding did not increase per project, which we can see in Figure 10. Figure 9 Yearly total funding per collaborative and per non-collaborative project over time Figure 10 Yearly mean funding sum per collaborative and per non-collaborative project over time It is conspicuous how much the average funding per both collaborative and per non-collaborative project decreased over time. What influence does this development have on the amount of money that a project member received when we take into account the heavy growth of R&D landscape participants shown in Figure 4 (or the higher amount of collaborative projects)? The answer can be seen in Figure 11. Figure 11 The average amount of money per member (not separated into collaborators and non-collaborators) seems to slightly decrease over time (apart from some exceptions in the 70’s where sums were much higher and therefore decreased heavily afterwards). This gives the impression that collaboration cannot be induced by money, since funds per member have not increased. But let’s have a closer look. It could be that funds for collaborators increased, but dropped for loners so that the overall amount dropped, too. For this, we’ll simply check the average amount of money per member vs. project size (in terms of number of members). This is presented in Figure 12. Figure 12 The difference of money per member is extreme. The more members in a project, the less money per member is available in that project. The correlation coefficient of Euro/proj and NOM/proj is almost zero (-0,03437) meaning that there is no correlation between the two variables. The correlation coefficient of the total budget/year and average NOM/proj/year [cor(WeightedAverageMPYear,BudgetPerYear)] is 0.569 meaning that there is medium high positive correlation between the total amount of research funding/year and the average NOM/proj/year. Summarizing, we find that money (funding sum per project) cannot explain the higher degree of cooperation since money/member decreases with the increasing of project size. Additionally there is no correlation between the funding sum of a project and its average NOM. We can observe, however, a correlation between the total research funding of a year and the average NOM per project in that year. This could have several reasons: 1. The result could be an indication for a general increase of private entities among the members since their funding rate and therefore average funding sum is inferior to the one for academic and public research institutions (source). More private entities in the landscape “automatically” reduce the funding amount per member. The next Chapter will therefore analyze the composition of members (types of organization) in the R&D landscape and within projects. 2. It could be that the funding institution favors cooperation among several “small” members instead of a few big projects with a few big players. “Small” may refer to the volume of their work within the project (more specialized tasks?) or to their company size (e.g. small and medium-sized enterprises (SME)). The funder plays a role in selecting the (joint) projects and possibly even selecting the partnerships. The size of the companies involved in the projects will not be analyzed during this thesis. What will be analyzed, however, is the role of politics (the funding institutions). Another fact is we do not know whether there were more funds planned for multi-member projects or whether increased collaboration was initiated solely by the R&D conducting organizations (which in turn could have several reasons such as experience for instance). This is commonly known as the chicken-egg-dilemma. However, it is eventually a political question how the available research funds are spent. 3. It could also be the desire of an institution to be involved in a project despite lower funding. It is possible that parties grasp the opportunity of being part of innovative approaches even if there are financial issues because of the expected high publicity and reputation coming from the project. However, this is unlikely to happen more than rarely and will not be discussed further in this thesis. To cover topical aspects as possible background for higher cooperation, the correlation between collaboration and the topic of projects will be analyzed in Chapter 7. 4. Last but not least inconsistencies in the data cannot be excluded. This was discussed in Chapter 2. The findings of this Chapter summarized: The mean funding sum for both non-collaborative and collaborative projects decreased over time. However, the overall average funding sum is much higher (ca. 240.000 €) for single-member-projects than for collaborative projects. The average amount of money per member in a project decreases with the increasing of the project size (in terms of NOM) and over time. There is no correlation between Euros/project and NOM/project. There is a medium high positive correlation between the total funding amount spent in a year and the average NOM/project. This means that money (e.g. higher funding sums for collaboration projects) alone cannot explain higher cooperation. However, the total budget (being a political decision) correlating with the higher averages of NOM/project may be an indicator for politics affecting increased cooperation. THE FACTOR TYPE OF ORGANIZATION This Chapter gives an overview of the distribution of types of organizations (in the following: TYPES) across the projects, first. Focus will be put on the cooperative behavior of the four different TYPES. Secondly, the following questions will be answered: Do certain TYPES participate in collaborative or non-collaborative, in big or small projects only (correlation type appearance vs. project size)? Is there evidence in the data that a TYPE cooperates more or less often with another TYPE (correlation type appearance with other types in projects)? Does the average NOM of a project and the type of partners correlate with the type of project leader? In Figure 13 the distribution of the most common TYPES across all 1353 R&D projects (total number of members, non-unique) is shown. On the left you see the main TYPES, namely industrial institutions (IND), universities (UNI), public research organizations (PRO) and others (OTHER). On the right hand side, PRO are split up into three main sub-groups of interest such as Fraunhofer institutes (FHG), Helmholtz institutes (HLMH) and all other PRO. Figure 13 Distribution of the type of organization across all R&D projects. The non-unique number of members per type per project is taken into account IND is best represented in the R&D projects (1651 industrial members, 53% of 3098 total members). UNI make the second biggest group (863 units, 28% of 3098 total members) followed by PRO (347 members, 11%) and OTHER (237, 8%). To get an impression of the cooperative behavior, we’ll look at how the organizations are spread across cooperative and non-cooperative projects, differentiating each project size category (1-11 members). The size of a project, here, is defined as the absolute number of non-unique members in that project. Figure 14 sheds light on the participation of TYPES in projects (absolute numbers). Figure 14 IND is the best represented TYPE in all project size categories, having its peak in projects with five members. UNI follows, being the second best represented type in almost all categories, but preferring single-member-projects. PRO are mostly spread across projects with one to five members, peaking in projects with five members just like IND. We can almost not see them in projects with more than five members. OTHER can be found in different project sizes, but they clearly show up most often in single-member projects. The general curve of this graph looks similar to Figure 5 where number of projects per category is presented. Obviously, the number of projects of a certain size influences the total number of members in that category. This is why we should also look at proportions. Figure 15 shows the proportions of IND, UNI, PRO and OTHER in each of the collaborative project sizes and draws linear trend lines. Figure 15 We can see that the proportion of IND (particularly) and OTHER (a little only) in projects increases with project size while the one of UNI (particularly) and PRO decreases. The coefficients in Table 3 confirm what we can slightly see in the graph: the bigger the projects get the more industry takes part on average, but the fewer Universities participate. Similar, but not as strong is the negative correlation between industry and PRO in this regard. There is almost no correlation to be found regarding the proportion between IND and OTHER as well as between PRO and OTHER vs. project size. Table 3 Pearson correlation coefficient r       Industry UNI PRO Other Industry 1       UNI -0,76213266 1     PRO -0,66481445 0,36925909 1   Other -0,19506222 -0,45610123 0,11382163 1 What we do not know is whether these numbers result from simple coincidence, from avoidance of certain partner types or from avoidance of certain project sizes. They can also depend upon the funding institution preferring a TYPE in their projects. We will therefore continue analyzing the cooperative behavior of the individual TYPES independently of their overall project participation (absolute numbers). Figure 16 depicts the proportion of a TYPE’s presence in the 11 project size categories according to the total number of organizations of that TYPE in the R&D landscape. We will call it the “project size preference” of a TYPE (nr of times a type appeared in a project category/number of times a type appeared in all projects). Figure 16 The highest share of OTHER can be found in single-member projects (of a total of 237 OTHER, 84 appeared in non-collaborative projects - 35,4%), but they do not seem to have a clear “project size preference” when it comes to collaboration: they show up in different project categories, sometimes being the smallest group (e.g. projects with 5 members), sometimes being the biggest (e.g. projects with 10 members). With a 24,6% share of their own group, UNI prefer single-member-projects as well. Their participation drops almost constantly as the number of members in a project increases. PRO are spread across projects with one to five members relatively equally, having their peak in projects with five members just like IND, while they tend to appear much less in bigger projects. However, PRO are cooperating the most: Only 17,6% of PRO do not cooperate which means that 82,4% of them do. As mentioned several times before, IND peaks in projects with five members. Considering the other project sizes, there is no clear pattern to be seen but the fact that IND does participate in all of them. With 80,7% IND collaborate almost as much as PRO. The proportion of these two TYPES is above the median (2422 of 3098 or 78,2%) of all collaborating members (see also Table 9 in the appendix). Another aspect worthy to analyze is the cooperation behavior of the project leading institution. The leader is responsible to report to the supervisor and client as well as to supervise the project’s progress. Therefore, some organizations might tend to avoid the effort of leading a project. However, project leaders decide who they want to collaborate with. So, they have an influence on the partners and may prefer one to the other. Figure 17 depicts leadership of the four different TYPES across the 1353 non-collaborative and collaborative R&D projects. Figure 17 There is no obvious difference between being a leader in a cooperative and a non-cooperative project. Industrial organizations have been leader of both, collaborative projects and non-collaborative projects almost as often (319/313 = 1,02). Universities, just like PRO, have been leaders more often of collaborative projects than of non-collaborative projects (UNI: 214/253 = 0,85; PRO: 61/88 = 0,69). OTHER led clearly more non-collaborative projects than non-collaborative projects (84/21 = 4). It is interesting to compare this with the collaborative behavior of the TYPES. OTHER and UNI were the less collaborative TYPES, PRO and IND the collaborative ones. However, IND led more non-collaborative projects and UNI more collaborative projects. A quick data analysis reveals that all TYPES have between min. 2,4 and max. 2,7 partners on average indicating that the type of leader does not much affect the average number of partners per collaborative project, but it does affect the TYPE of the partner. In the case of industrial leaders the clear preference is an industrial partner. In Figure 18, the amount of partners vs. TYPE (black and grey bars) as well as the number of times a TYPE was a leader of a project is shown (blue bar). Figure 18 You can see that the industry was project leader 313 times and in those 313 projects had a total of 559 industrial partners, 152 academic partners, 80 PRO partners and 58 other partners. This means that a project with an industrial project leader on average had 2,7 partners of which 1,8 companies, 0,5 Universities, 0,3 PRO and 0,2 other organizations as project partners (numbers rounded). We can state a “preference” in the selection of partners: Firms tend to work more often with other firms. In the case of Universities, the statement is the following: a project with an academic project leader on average had 2,4 partners of which 1,2 companies, 0,7 Universities, and also 0,3 PRO and 0,2 other organizations as project partners. The direct comparison between UNI and IND shows that industrial leaders have 1,5 times as many partnering firms in their projects. PROs, especially the Fraunhofer society, have the task to conduct applied research, work together with the industry on their challenges and transfer knowledge between academia and industry. Who do PRO leaders work with? A project with a public research organization as project leader had on average 2,6 partners of which 1,6 companies, 0,6 Universities, 0,4 PRO and 0,1 other organizations as project partners (numbers rounded). It is quite interesting to see that PRO tend to collaborate mostly with IND and more with UNI than with other PRO. This might be an indicator of competition between different PRO or could be due to the fact that there are fewer PRO in the wind R&D business than University players. OTHER organizations have rarely been project leader, namely 21 times. A project led by OTHER had on average 2,4 partners of which 1,2 companies, 0,3 Universities, 0,3 PRO and 0,5 other organizations as project partners (numbers rounded). OTHER had as many partners as Universities on average, but less than PRO and IND. They also tend to cooperate with the industry and work more often with their own kind than with PRO and UNI. The proportions of the above listed absolute numbers are presented in Figure 19. Figure 19 Industrial players “prefer” industrial partners overwhelmingly: 66% of their partners have a private background. With 18% of their partners being UNI, they tend to collaborate more often with UNI than with PRO and OTHER, and do rarely select the last two mentioned as partners. UNI tend to cooperate with the industry the most, too. 48% of their partners are companies. However, every third partner is an academic institution, making them the most probable leader for a project with academic partners. UNI do not often collaborate with PRO, but still more frequent than with OTHER. We can furthermore summarize that all TYPES prefer the industry as partner, however, IND do more than others and UNI least. Also, UNI and PRO prefer Universities as partners over PRO. OTHER seem to prefer their own kind. With 86%, PRO are most open to other TYPES than all others (IND: 34%, UNI: 69%, OTHER: 78%). In order to detect whether this scenario is depending on the project leader alone, we will now look at the collaboration in projects independently of the leader. For this, we calculate how many partners of each TYPE a TYPE had considering all projects it participated in. Table 4 shows this collaboration (grey background) and compares to the numbers when taking into account leadership (white background). Numbers indicate the amount of project partners of a TYPE (column) vs. TYPE. The average number in the parenthesis refers to the number of projects in the column they are in and is rounded to one decimal point. For example, in 416 collaborative projects at least one member was a University. Projects with at least one University had a total of 624 industrial members which means that each project with at least one UNI had on average 1,5 industrial members. Table At least one of those 🡪 collaborated that many times with the below Industry University PRO OTHER Member Leader Member Leader Member Leader Member Leader Nr. of collab projects with at least one such member 544 313 416 253 230 88 120 21 IND 788 (1,5) 559 (1,8) 624 (1,5) 298 (1,2) 408 (1,8) 136 (1,6) 194 (1,6) 26 (1,2) Uni 414 (0,8) 152 (0,5) 235 (0,6) 188 (0,7) 188 (0,8) 48 (0,6) 100 (0,8) 6 (0,3) PRO 189 (0,4) 80 (0,3) 155 (0,4) 78 (0,3) 56 (0,2) 33 (0,4) 46 (0,4) 7 (0,3) OTHER 104 (0,2) 58 (0,2) 80 (0,2) 51 (0,2) 52 (0,2) 12 (0,1) 33 (0,3) 11 (0,5) Projects with the same type only 116 47 7 4 Let’s first look at the numbers taking into account only members (grey background): The industry is the most common partner of all TYPES, followed by UNI: In every project in which at least one IND, UNI, PRO or OTHER participates in, there is at least 1,5 IND taking part. Projects that contain at least one IND, one PRO or one OTHER collaborate more often with UNI than UNI does (0,8 vs. 0,6). PRO and OTHER make ca. a third respectively ca. a fifth of the project partners of projects with at least one of the other TYPES. The number of projects that consisted of one TYPE only is added in the last column. 116 collaborative projects consisted of only industrial companies, 47 of only Universities, 7 of only PRO and 4 of only OTHER. Universities, PRO and OTHER seem to collaborate across sectors. For companies, a fifth of the projects is carried out within their own (private) sector. Compared to the leadership scenario (white background), we can observe for all four types a higher degree of collaboration with their own kind, when they are leaders compared to when they are partners. This is accompanied by the fact that they have fewer or as many partners of all other TYPES when they are leaders compared to when they are partners. Assuming the leader is free to decide about its partners, we can summarize that an organization choses collaborating with an organization of the same type. Lastly, we will analyze the development over time. The appearance of types of organizations in projects (absolute numbers) as well as the number of projects over the years is shown in Figure 20 (with support lines). Remember that for XX projects the start date was not available, therefore these projects are not represented in this graph but are comprised by the tables and calculations above. Also, the year 2013 is not shown in the graph as explained before. Figure 20 Presence of organization types in projects over time There is a general increase of members which is in line with the development of the number of projects (red dots; shown before also in Figure 3). The parallel becomes especially clear when looking at 1996, a year with an extreme increase of IND members and a sudden increase of projects starts. This graph makes it also possible to see that the number of members per project increased over time: While until ca. 1996 the red dots are above the dots for the number of members, those lines will partly be located above the red line, afterwards. The total number of IND participating in a project in every year increased stronger than that of the other TYPES. OTHER remained relatively stable. Interesting to see is that the number of PRO increased much slower than that of UNI during ca. 2000-2009. However, in 2012 their numbers of active members match. In line with this development is the development of the member proportion of the project consortia over time, which is presented in Figure 21. In this figure we can see that until 1991, the proportions of the TYPES in projects are very irregular. From 1992 until 1998 the industrial proportion increases steadily, displacing OTHER and UNI. The proportion of PRO in projects, after PRO having vanished in 1992 and 1993, “recovers” from 1994 on, growing quite regularly until today. Comparatively, we can observe a general decline of UNI from 2000 on, after UNI were very present in projects in 1999. We get a similar impression when looking at OTHER. However, this observation will not be further pursued during this thesis. Figure 21 Summarizing the findings of this Chapter: Most commonly among the 1353 R&D projects appear IND, followed by UNI, PRO and OTHER. IND is also best represented across all project categories, followed by UNI. The proportion of IND and OTHER per project increases with project size while the one of UNI and PRO decreases with project size. The bigger the projects get the more industry takes part on average, but the fewer Universities participate. Similar, but not as strong is the correlation between firms and PRO. OTHER are the biggest non-collaborators, followed by UNI. The biggest collaborators are PRO, followed by IND. The type of leader does not affect the average number of partners per collaborative project in general, but it does affect the type of the partner: for all four types, a higher degree of collaboration with their own kind was observed for when they are leaders compared to when they are partners. During the past decade we can observe a decline of UNI, a repeated increase of IND, a growing participation of PRO and a decreasing amount of OTHER in the projects. THE FACTOR FUNDER Introduction There is the possibility of politics determining the cooperation behavior. The factor “politics” in this thesis will be defined as the funding behavior of the funding institution. A funding institution can be more or less interested in enforcing cooperation – or cooperation among certain beneficiaries. In this Chapter, funders and their funding behavior will be presented. Second, we will show who funded who (TYPES vs. FUNDER). Are there any distinctive features regarding the funding behavior? Is there more cooperation under one funder than under another? In total, 186 institutions acted as funders. Among these were 24 federal institutions, 54 state institutions, 3 European sources (including the EU Commission), 95 private organizations as well as 10 foreign institutions. Of the unique funders, 130 funded only one project, 38 two to five projects, and five institutions supported up to 10 projects. That means that a remainder of only 13 funders supported more than 10 projects over the whole 39 years. This is why for a first analysis the funding institutions were categorized. Afterwards, we will focus on federal funders and the EU which supported the majority of projects. Note that the analysis of this Chapter will be done with a population of 927 projects since aspects of money will be considered as well. This causes that statements regarding project numbers will not be consistent with those of Chapter 3 and 5 where we dealt with 1353 projects. The type of funder and their cooperation-related funding behavior The most active funders of wind energy R&D in Germany were federal ministries (“Federal-Funder”). They supported a total of 690 projects. Second most active were private funders with 86 projects (“Private-Funder”), followed closely by the EU with 76 projects (“EU-Funder”). Federal state funders have supported a total of 64 projects (“State-Funders”). With only six projects, foreign institutions were little involved (“Foreign-Funder”). This is represented in Table 5. Note that the total number of projects and of members shall not be added up since they may be supported by more than one funder and therefore may be counted twice (or more times) in this table. Because of this, the terms support or funding always include the terms co-support and co-funding. Several parameters shall give us an indication about the cooperation behavior under a funder type: the proportion of collaborative projects of all supported projects, the total and proportional funding sum spent for collaborative projects, and the average NOM per collaborative project. As shown in Table 5, the clear majority of all funders’ projects are collaborative projects. At least 65% of all supported projects are collaborative. When considering the mean of the proportions (70,8%), the EU’s and foreign funders’ proportions are above that average, the other funders’ proportions below. Table 5 Funding and cooperation behavior vs. funder types (based on 927 projects) Nr. of project with information about funding: 927 Federal-Funder State-Funder EU-Funder Private-Funder Foreign-Funder Projects funded 690 64 76 86 6 Of which collaborative projects (proportion in %, rounded) 447 (65%) 44 (69%) 55 (72%) 56 (65%) 5 (83%) Members supported (non-unique) 1705 137 249 176 10 Of which in collaborative projects Average NOM / collaborative project (rounded) 3,7 3,17 4,6 3,16 2,33 Total expenses (rounded; in mill €) 503,41 54,42 75,71 66,45 6,05 Of which spent for cooperation (rounded; in mill €; and proportion in %) 334,48 (66%) 37,07 (68%) 47,83 (63%) 38,04 (57%) 6,04 (99,9%) Average € / project (rounded; in mill. €) 0,730 0,850 0,996 0,773 1,008 Average € / collaborative project (rounded; in mill. €) 0,748 0,843 0,870 0,679 1,209 Average € / non-collaborative project (rounded; in mill. €) 0,695 0,868 1,328 0,947 0,009 The EU has also the highest average NOM, having about 4,6 members in every collaborative project on average. In contrast, foreign funders have the lowest average NOM with 2,33 per collaborative project. Federal funders are second with 3,7 members in every collaborative project on average. It is interesting that private funders do not augment collaboration compared to the other funders. They even have the second lowest average NOM (3,16), together with state funders (3,17). The range of the average NOM per collaborative project is approximately 2 members (4,6-2,33), and so the difference between the funder groups is quite big: The EU has twice, and federal funders 1,6 times as many members in their projects compared to foreign funders. With a mean value of 3.39 (of the average NOM), the EU and federal funders are above that average, all other funders are below. Comparing the budget for cooperation and the cooperation activity, we find that foreign funders have spent almost their complete budget (which is, however, very small compared to that of the others) for cooperation supporting almost only collaborative projects in Germany. The reason probably is to make another institution in its own country benefit from that collaboration. The low average NOM could be explained if they funded only bilateral cooperation projects involving one institution of their own country and one in Germany. With 68% of the budget, state funders have put the second highest budget proportion into cooperation. Similar proportions were spent by federal funders and the EU. We also find that private funders were least funding cooperation projects (57%) but actually have equally as many members in their collaborative projects on average as state funders. Additionally, the average funding amount for collaborative projects is smaller than for non-collaborative projects for all funders excluding federal and foreign funders. In summary, we find that the EU and foreign funders have a bigger proportion of collaborative projects in their project portfolio than other funders, the EU and federal funders have more members per collaborative project on average, and “political” funders (all but the private funders) have a stronger tendency to fund cooperation than private funders but the average NOM per collaborative project does not necessarily differ. The second object of interest is the correlation between a funder group and the numbers of members per TYPE of all members supported by that funder. The proportions considering all projects are represented in Figure 22, the ones considering collaborative projects are represented in Figure 23. Both give us an indication of whether there are differences between the funders regarding the financing of certain types of organizations in total (all projects) as well as regarding inter-institutional collaboration (looking only at collaborative projects). Figure 22 Proportions of Types in all projects vs. Funder (rounded) Approx. 80% of the members of a project – this is true for all funders – are industrial and academic members, and 20% are public research organizations and other organizations. We find that the EU and Federal funders mostly support IND, and only every fourth member in their projects is a University. State and Private Funders have a similar funding behavior: half of the members are industrial and every third member is a UNI. Striking is the fact that foreign institutions support Universities more often than industry and they also support more OTHER organizations than German public funders do, who, on the other hand side, support PRO more. Directly compared, this could imply that within Germany a lot of industrial funding instead of research funding is happening through R&D programs. However, it is surprising that, whenever private entities support or are among the supporters of a project, the proportion of IND among all members is smaller (than in the case of federal, EU or state funders) – but not as small as in the case of foreign funders. This suggests that funding from the industry is not automatically accompanied by participation of private entities in the respective project. Private funding could exclude other private organizations from the project e.g. to not make competitors benefit. It’s almost the other way round for UNI: EU Programs and federal agencies support UNI less often than the other three groups of funders. When looking at Figure 23 (which shows collaborative projects data only), the numbers change only a little. We find a bigger difference in the case of foreign funders, where UNI seem to appear less often in favor of IND which increase. This means that foreign funders tend to support Universities more often in single-member-projects, and enterprises above all in collaborative projects. Figure 23 Proportions of Types in collaborative projects vs. Funder Comparing these numbers with the number of Figure 13 (IND: 53%, UNI 28%, PRO 11%, OTHER 8%), we find that industry is the main beneficiary (here: in terms of appearance in projects - not in terms of money) of the EU and federal agencies, and that UNI are supported mostly by state, private and, particularly, foreign funders. German federal funders and the EU, and their cooperation-related funding behavior Among the German federal institutions funding R&D projects in the database are: the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi), the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT), and the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV). Figure 24 sketches very roughly the timeline and funding amount of each of these funders. Additionally, the European commission as well as different European funds are represented together as “EU”. The figure shows during which periods a funder has supported projects according to data from the database. The size of the arrows is supposed to give a timeless idea of the budget. Each arrow carries the abbreviation of the funder, the approximate funding amount spent over the whole time of the funding activity and the starting (and if applicable also the ending) date of the funding activity. For example, the EU spent approx. 92 million Euros starting in 1982 and has not stopped funding wind projects until today. The BMBF followed up on the BMFT and supported wind energy projects with a total of 102 million Euros between 1994 and 1998 and from 2004 on. The Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection BMELV spent only ca. 3 mill. Euros (during 2004-2005 and 2011-2012). Etc. Figure 24 There were a few responsibility and name changes among the ministries in the past decades (se excursus) that explain the changing of the main funding source (ministry) for wind projects in Germany. EXKURSUS Today’s BMBF is a merger of two different ministries co-existing for several decades. The first, Bundesministerium für Bildung und Wissenschaft existed from 1969 until 1994. It did not fund any wind power R&D projects, which is why this name does not appear in any of the graphs. In 1972 the BMFT was founded to promote basic and applied research as well as the general technological development. In 1994 the two ministries were merged to become the German Federal Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Technology (also abbreviated BMBF). In 1998 the competence “technology policy” was given to the BMWi, and the full name of BMBF changed back to Federal Ministry for Education and Research. [6_Forschungsförderung des BMUsFuerEE_Deller2010.pdf] This is why in the following Figure 25 the BMFT and the BMBF have the same symbol (blue triangles). The BMU was established in 1986 (while the building resort had already existed since 1949). The major event regarding wind energy R&D funding was that the BMU has been given the responsibility of research funding for renewable energies in 2002/2003. In 2013, after the change of government, this responsibility was given to the BMWi and the BMU was renamed BMUB (BM für Umwelt, Naturschutz, Bau und Reaktorsicherheit). (siehe ggf. Buch, das ich bestellt habe: Die Umweltmacher: 20 Jahre BMU-Geschichte und Zukunft der Umweltpolitik, nutze als quelle) [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesministerium_f%C3%BCr_Bildung_und_Forschung] The BMWi exists since 1949. Set up as Federal Ministry of Economics (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft), it kept this name until 1998. Since then, it has undergone a lot of organizational changes. Among other competence changes (not relevant for this thesis), it took over the department of technology policy from the BMBF in 1998. For four years (1998-2002), it bore the name of Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie). After the elections in 2002, the ministry was merged with the former Federal Ministry for Work and Social Affairs and therefore was called the Federal Ministry of Economics and Labour (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Arbeit) between 2002 and 2005. In 2005 it returned to being called the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology. With the change of government in 2013, the BMWi became the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, assuming full political responsibility for the whole field of energy policy. [https://www.bmwi.de/DE/Ministerium/geschichte.html] The BMWi is represented with red symbols in the following graph. The BMELV was founded in 1929 as Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry (Bundesministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten). When for the first time it was given responsibility for consumer protection in 2001, the name changed to German Federal Ministry for Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture (Bundesministerium für Verbraucherschutz, Ernährung und Landwirtschaft (BMVEL)). It was renamed Federal Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (Bundesministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz (BMELV)). After the elections in 2013, parts of the field consumer protection were assumed by the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection and it became the Federal Ministry for Food and Agriculture (Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft (BMEL)). [http://www.bmel.de/DE/Ministerium/_Texte/Geschichteseit1949.html] The development and shifting of competences of the ministries show that analyzing the correlation between politics and cooperation can be done using different approaches. The correlation between governmental targets, respective governing political parties or specific decision-makers (ministers, departmental leaders) and the decisions on project funding and resulting degree of cooperation could be analyzed. The governmental targets regarding energy research can be looked up in the German energy research programs (ERP) and, in the case of the EU, in the framework programs (FP). However, it cannot be excluded that further research programs include wind energy R&D. Due to the limited amount of time available for this thesis we will therefore connect only the administrative funding source (EU, ministries) to cooperation behavior. The main interest is whether there is a correlation to be observed at all. The following Figure 25 shows the exact funding amounts that were outlined before over time. Colored symbols assign the funding source. The starting points of each of the ERPs and FPs during the time observed are represented as well. Figure 25 Total yearly funding by federal funders and the EU over time (based on 927 projects) It is quite interesting to see how the wind energy R&D funding per year varies over time. Very high expenses by BMFT were complemented by the EU from 1982 on. When the technology department was given from the BMFT to the BMWi in 1998, the funding of the then called BMBF (former BMFT) suddenly melts down. Briefly before, the BMWi starts funding but does not get close to the sums spent by BMFT/BMBF before. Instead, BMU increases strongly its funding activity, spending comparable amounts as the BMFT and becoming the largest funder for wind energy R&D projects in the past two decades. This can at least partly be explained by the fact that BMU has been given the responsibility of research funding for renewable energies in 2002/2003. BMBF, BMWi and EU keep funding projects parallel to the BMU until today (with interruptions). The BMELV is not shown in this graph due to its small total funding amount. Confronting this graph with the cooperation and cooperation funds shown in Figure 9, we find that during the years of BMFT being the main funder a huge budget was available, but almost nobody cooperated. The appearance of higher cooperation particularly from 2004 on coincides with the BMBF starting to fund wind energy R&D again after a short break on the one hand, and the BMU’s and EU’s strongly increasing budget one the other hand. This implies a correlation between cooperation and politics. Table 6 compares the cooperation behavior under the different funders. The indicators we will use for this are the same as for the funder types: the proportion of collaborative projects of all projects, the total and proportional funding sum spent for collaborative projects, and the average NOM per collaborative project .
