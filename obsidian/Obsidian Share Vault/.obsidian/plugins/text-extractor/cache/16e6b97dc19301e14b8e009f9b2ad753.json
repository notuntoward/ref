The project developed a comprehensive distribution network management framework that unifies real-time voltage and frequency control with network-wide energy management under an integrated framework. The aim of the project was to: (1) systematically optimize network-wide operation and congruently regulate voltages and frequency in the face of high volatility induced by rapidly varying RES and uncontrolled loads; (2) facilitate high renewable integration beyond 50% on an energy basis; (3) meet power quality requirements and operational constraints; and (4) respect response, ramp time, and hold time requirements for synthetic frequency and regulating reserves via fast- and longer term dynamic energy management. The developed distributed control architecture continuously steers operating points of DERs toward optimal solutions of pertinent optimization problems while dynamically procuring and dispatching synthetic reserves based on current system state and forecasts of ambient and load conditions. The control algorithms invoke simple mathematical operations that can be embedded on low-cost microcontrollers and enable distributed decision making on timescales that match the dynamics of distribution systems with high renewable integration. The developed framework was tested and validated using (1) extensive software-only simulation; (2) closed-loop experiments with large-scale, real-time power systems models via 4 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. hardware-in-the-loop techniques; and (3) actual field deployments. To translate algorithms to marketable products, the project principal investigators took part in the U.S. Department of Energy Energy I-Corps program to define the business model, customer segments, and potential revenue streams. Several patent applications were filed, and the technology was recently licensed by an industry company to explore the commercialization path using smart meter platforms. The developed platform would help the U.S. grid assimilate at least 50% of renewable generation and provide system reliability and resilience while managing emerging energy generation and consumption patterns. The addition of flexible loads and DERs into the U.S. grid could offset 3.3 quads of thermal generation and displace 290 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. If this platform is adopted by industry, it will potentially help to replace 4.5 GW of spinning reserves (i.e., generation capacity on standby in case of outages and unforeseen intermittency), a value of $3.3 billion per year. A more efficient and reliable grid would help protect U.S. businesses from costly power outages and brownouts.

Accomplishments and Objectives The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), California Institute of Technology, University of Minnesota, Harvard University, and Southern California Edison (SCE) developed an innovative control architecture for distributed energy resource (DER) systems that addresses the unique needs of utility companies, DER aggregators, and end customers who own grid assets. The new architecture is applicable to distribution systems, microgrids, and soft microgrids. It unifies real-time voltage and frequency control at the level of the home, building, or energy resource, with network-wide power management at the level of the utility or aggregator. This real-time distributed control architecture allows unprecedented flexibility, reliability, and efficiency of DER operations. Figure 1: Real-time distributed optimization platform The real-time optimization architecture enables: - Optimization of an entire distribution grid in real time to increase system efficiency and reliability - The ability for feeders, neighborhoods, and communities to emulate virtual power plants providing services to the grid (such as frequency support, regulating services, or capacity reserves) while concurrently addressing unique operational objectives - Reliable integration and seamless, large-scale coordination of DERs - 100% integration of renewable energy resources - Interoperability with legacy grid components and advanced distribution management systems. Targeted Applications and Customer Segments The real-time optimization architecture offers: 6 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. - A solution for investor-owned utility companies, cooperatives, and municipalities, providing control modules located at the utility and at the DER level, synergistically coordinating in real time through the developed technology - A solution for urban and rural microgrids for real-time distributed optimization of DERs - A solution for urban soft microgrids (community-, campus-, and neighborhood-level systems connected to the rest of the grid through one point of interconnection) and community choice aggregations Hardware-in-the-Loop Validation The project team built a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) research platform where the proposed technology has been validated using realistic distribution feeder models with hundreds of controllable assets. The team performed the first-of-its-kind power HIL experiment with at least 100 DERs at power, controlled in real time and operated as if connected to the feeder. The experiments were performed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) (see www.nrel.gov/esif ). Field Deployments The technology has been tested at the Stone Edge Farm Microgrid in Sonoma Valley, California, and deployed in the territory of the electric cooperative Holy Cross Energy in Colorado. The Stone Edge Farm Microgrid in Sonoma Valley is a unique test bed extending more than 16 acres in Sonoma, California—see Figure 2. It includes various controllable assets, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, energy storage systems, a hydrogen electrolyzer, gas turbines, and controllable loads. The microgrid is operated by Heila Technologies. Holy Cross Energy electric co-op in Colorado is based in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, and serves neighboring municipalities (see Figure 3), including the famous ski resorts Aspen and Vail. The developed technology was tested in the Basalt Vista affordable housing community, build by Habitat for Humanity. The community includes 27 homes for teachers and members of the local workforce; 4 homes were selected for the field deployment. The houses are designed as zero net energy buildings with all electric construction. Each of the four homes had five controllable DERs, including a solar panel system that ties to the grid through an inverter; a battery system that also ties to the grid using an inverter; an electric vehicle (EV) charger; and a heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning system. A Heila EDGE device was installed next to each asset to run the algorithms. 7 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.

Addressing Customer and Utility Needs The real-time architecture provides unique coordination and feedback-based optimization capabilities to enable large-scale integrations of DERs by: 1. Leveraging real-time network-wide coordination to ensure reliable system operation during fast-changing ambient conditions and loads and to enable fast response to disturbances precipitating from the main grid, sudden loss of load, and network failures 2. Ensuring voltage regulation and ampacity limits for any integration level of DERs 3. Automatically managing a large number of DERs without requiring the utility to run extensive feasibility studies and track their usage patterns 4. Enabling behind-the-meter DER management based on local objectives that are flexibly defined by end users while partaking in grid operations to enhance reliability. Enabling Virtual Power Plants Traditional approaches to regulating frequency and maintaining reliable operation of transmission systems use primary frequency response, automatic generation control, and regulation services provided by large-scale synchronous generators. In the future, dispatchable DERs could supplement generation-side capabilities by providing additional flexibility in regulating frequency and maintaining reliable system operation. Toward realizing this vision, the project team leveraged real-time coordination and feedback-based optimization to develop an algorithmic framework for DER aggregations in distribution feeders to emulate a virtual power plant that can effectively provide regulation services to the bulk system and guarantee power quality across the distribution network. To provide primary frequency support, the team synthesized controllers for DERs located throughout a feeder so that the active power injected at the feeder head could collectively adjust in response to frequency deviations. This framework enables analysis at the transmission level, where distribution-level DER aggregations can effectively be modeled as virtual power plants that provide primary frequency response needs at the feeder head. To provide secondary frequency support and regulating services at multiple temporal scales, the team developed a distributed control architecture that manages active power at the feeder head in real time to track given set points. For example, a set point could be an automatic generation control signal, a ramping signal, or a 5-minute dispatch commanded by the transmission system operator. Controllers are designed to track the set point at the feeder head, concurrently maximize customer and utility performance objectives, and ensure that electrical limits are enforced throughout the feeder. Several tasks and milestones were laid out in Attachment 3, the Technical Milestones and Deliverables, at the beginning of the project. The actual performance against the stated milestones is summarized here. 9 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.

M8.3.2: Documentation for utility demonstration (Q12) Actual Performance: (Q14) The field demonstration was successfully conducted. The experiment showed how our algorithms can perform: (1) peak load management: charging battery during off-peak time and then discharging battery during peak time (4 p.m.–9 p.m.) to offset net load consumption; and (2) real-time optimization, with the objective of zero power flow at the transformer. 19 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. Project Activities The project developed a comprehensive distribution network management framework that unifies real-time voltage and frequency control with network-wide energy management under an integrated framework. The aim of the project was to: (1) systematically optimize network- wide operation and congruently regulate voltages and frequency in the face of high volatility induced by rapidly varying RES and uncontrolled loads; (2) facilitate high renewable integration beyond 50% on an energy basis; (3) meet power quality requirements and operational constraints; and (4) respect response, ramp time, and hold time requirements for synthetic frequency and regulating reserves via fast- and longer term dynamic energy management. The developed distributed control architecture continuously steers operating points of DERs toward optimal solutions of pertinent optimization problems while dynamically procuring and dispatching synthetic reserves based on current system state and forecasts of ambient and load conditions. The control algorithms invoke simple mathematical operations that can be embedded on low-cost microcontrollers and enable distributed decision making on timescales that match the dynamics of distribution systems with high renewable integration. The developed framework was tested and validated using (1) extensive software-only simulation; (2) closed- loop experiments with large-scale, real-time power systems models via HIL techniques; and (3) actual field deployments.

(UCL) (NREL-16-126/UCL-118) because of the inventorship contributions (Dall’Anese and Bernstein from NREL and Simonetto from UCL). NREL and UCL have executed an inter- institutional agreement designating NREL/The Alliance for Sustainable Energy as the lead institution for licensing and patent prosecution associated with the joint patent portfolio. G. Licensed Technologies Previously, NREL partnered with IP Group, Inc. (f.k.a FedIMPACT, LLC) under a field-limited 12-month option to an exclusive license for the NODES patent portfolio. IP Group is an investment entity that seeks early-stage commercialization opportunities viable for start-up company formation that are based on university and national laboratory technology. IP Group executed the option agreement for the technology, funded Emiliano Dall’Anese and Andrey Bernstein to go through the DOE Energy I-Corps, which is a 7-week dedicated entrepreneurial training program (cohort 6),and funded a cooperative research-and-development agreement (CRADA) at NREL to evaluate commercialization-related activities for taking the NODES IP portfolio to market. In December 2019, IP Group decided that they did not want to proceed with this opportunity nor start-up company formation due to lack of expertise within IP Group and certainty in the market. The IP Group CRADA and option were completed and allowed to go abandoned. In February 2020, NREL began a partnership with another commercialization entity, Utilidata, Inc., that we believe is more suitable for taking such technology opportunities to market. Utilidata has executed a 6- to 12-month option to an exclusive field-limited license to patentable subject matter. Included in the option agreement is the ability to pursue nonexclusive rights to copyrightable subject matter (NREL software record SWR-18-27, see more information below) created under the NODES project. Currently, Utilidata is working with NREL to establish a multiproject CRADA and is seeking joint funding efforts to proceed with commercialization of a NODES-integrated smart meter product. More information is available here: https://utilidata.com/press/utilidata-secures-rights-to-technology-for-bringing-real-time- operational-controls-to-the-grid-edge/. If the collaboration goes well and Utilidata meets the diligence milestones under their option agreement during the next 6 months to 1 year, NREL may proceed to negotiate and place a field-limited exclusive license.

Other Products (e.g., Databases, Physical Collections, Audio/Video, Software, Models, Educational Aids or Curricula, Equipment or Instruments) NREL software record SWR-18-27, “Real-Time Feedback-Based Optimization of Distribution Grids” (closed-source copyright assertion, MATLAB-based code) This software enables (groups of) DERs to pursue given performance objectives while adjusting their (aggregate) powers to respond to services requested by grid operators and to maintain electrical quantities within engineering limits. The design of the algorithm leverages a time-varying bilevel problem formulation capturing various performance objectives and engineering constraints and an online implementation of primal-dual projected-gradient methods. The gradient steps are suitably modified to accommodate appropriate measurements from the distribution network and the DERs. By virtue of this approach, the resultant algorithm can cope with inaccuracies in the distribution system modeling, it avoids pervasive metering to gather the state of noncontrollable resources, and it naturally lends itself to a distributed implementation. 25 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.
