As civic leaders free from politics, we feel compelled to warn the city we love about this troublesome transportation tax of $1.5 billion. Why should you pay the largest tax in Seattle’s history when it leaves bridges, streets and sidewalks in dangerous disrepair while increasing traffic congestion? Proposition 1, the Levy to Move Seattle, is Opinion 10/18/24, 11:38 P M Vote no on P rop. 1, Levy to Move S eattle | The S eattle Times https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/vote-no-on-prop-1-levy-to-move-seattle/ 1/4 unaffordable, inequitable and ineffective. Vote “no” to reject and redo this bloated levy. Here are 15 reasons to send Proposition 1 back to the drawing board: 1.      TOO EXPENSIVE: $1.5 billion hurts not only homeowners but also renters and small businesses. For the owner of a median-valued home, that’s a whopping $500 per year. 2.      WORSENS CONGESTION: Proposition 1 takes your tax dollars to disrupt streets with overly complex projects lasting years, which will worsen traffic congestion throughout Seattle both during and after construction. 3.      DECEPTIVE BALLOT TITLE: This levy is NOT a “renewal.” It’s a 75% increase. Instead of a disciplined focus on overdue repairs, it’s a heap of newly invented, wasteful categories from interest groups — and it deletes what’s needed: congestion relief. 4.      FAILS SAFETY: Pedestrians suffer the most traffic fatalities, but this levy allocates only 10% for sidewalks. 5.      BROKEN PROMISES FOR BROKEN BRIDGES: After the bridge audit exposed weaker bridges, this proposed levy repeats the same unfulfilled promises and fails to fix several dangerous bridges. The Magnolia Bridge gets “potential studies” and bridges spanning the ship canal remain at-risk during earthquakes. 6.      WEAKENS ACCOUNTABILITY: City politicians removed the Bridge Engineer from the oversight committee! 7.      PRIVILEGES BIKES INSTEAD OF BASICS: Vice President Kamala Harris and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have correctly urged cities to focus on maintenance (“Fix it First”). But Proposition 1 squanders your money on new, disruptive and expensive projects such as bike lanes that often worsen traffic congestion. As The Times editorial board noted, “it’s possible Seattle streets could be in worse condition than they are today.” 8.      PILES ON BACK-TO-BACK TAX HIKES: This tax adds to the financial burdens of lower income families, seniors stuck on fixed incomes and renters. City Hall could have funded half of the transportation projects with impact fees on development, instead of raising your taxes. 9.      RAISES RENTS: Whether you’re renting an apartment, running a small business, or living in an assisted living facility, landlords will dump this property tax increase 10/18/24, 11:38 P M Vote no on P rop. 1, Levy to Move S eattle | The S eattle Times https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/vote-no-on-prop-1-levy-to-move-seattle/ 2/4 onto you as higher rent. 10. UNFAIR and INEQUITABLE: This levy fails City Hall’s own racial equity analysis because its survey shows that most people of color oppose this levy AND states that it will financially harm struggling residents. 11. CUTS ACCESS TO SMALL BUSINESSES: Struggling stores and restaurants along Madison Street have suffered years of torn-up streets and more disruption is coming to neighborhoods throughout Seattle. Adding new bike lanes will remove parking and make it hard for customers to reach small neighborhood businesses. 12. HURTS SENIORS: Seniors struggle to maintain their homes as their property taxes increase every year. Proposition 1 misleadingly advertises an exemption for a few, but the fine print reveals it’s extremely limited. It also fails to protect renters, including seniors in retirement homes. 13. SDOT DOESN’T NEED YOUR MONEY NOW: SDOT will still have more than 70% of its $700 million annual budget. Because SDOT is behind on its current projects, it has plenty to do in 2025 before collecting more money from you. 14. REMOVES CHOICE: Vote “no” so that we can force City Hall to offer voters real transportation choices. Let’s instead have diverse, bite-size ballot options next year: (A) Re-Paving, (B) Bridges, (C) Sidewalks, (D) Bikes, (E) Streetcars, and/or (F) Other. Let’s see which investments voters really want. 15. LACKS TRANSPARENCY: Prop 1 makes a joke of transparency because the Seattle City Council members can just change how they spend the money later. By voting against this $1.5 billion boondoggle, you are voting in favor of a sensible solution: for City Hall to go back to the drawing board. By voting “no” on Prop 1, you keep your money until City Hall gets its own house in order. Nina Martinez; is president of the Latino Civic Alliance.
