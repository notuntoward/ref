Good attention checks are highly randomizable, meaning respondents don’t start to recognize the same trap question over and over again 01. Good attention checks are simple and fair to the respondent but require some effort 03. Good attention checks can identify bad respondents without penalizing good respondents. At Morning Consult, we routinely test attention checks to make sure we are not over-burdening respondents. Recently, we tested over a dozen different attention checks and rigorously evaluated the quality of respondents who passed and failed each attention check. The finding? Not all attention checks are equal.
