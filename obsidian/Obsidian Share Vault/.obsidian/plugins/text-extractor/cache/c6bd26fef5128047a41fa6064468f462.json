Abstract. Lithium-ion batteries play a critical role in the reliability and safety of a system. Battery health monitoring and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction are needed to prevent catastrophic failure of the battery. The aim of this research is to develop a data-driven method to monitor the batteries state of health and predict their RUL by using the battery capacity degradation data. This paper also investigated the effect of prediction starting point to the RUL prediction error. One of the data-driven method drawbacks is the need of a large amount of data to obtain accurate prediction. This paper proposed a method to generate a series of degradation data that follow the Gaussian distribution based on limited battery capacity degradation data. The prognostic model was constructed from the new data using least square support vector machine (LSSVM) regression. The remaining useful life prediction was carried out by extrapolating the model until reach the end of life threshold. The method was applied to three differences lithium-ion batteries capacity data. The results showed that the proposed method has good performance. The method can predict the lithium-ion batteries RUL with a small error, and the optimal RUL starting point was found at the point where the battery has experienced the highest capacity recovery due to the self-recharge phenomenon. Introduction Nowadays, the use of lithium-ion batteries is growing rapidly, ranging from electronic equipment such as laptops, mobile phones, camera, video recorder until the application in the automotive industry such as hybrid and electric cars. It can not be separated from the advantages of lithium-ion batteries compared to other battery types. They are lightweight, smaller size, greater energy densities, no memory effect, and long cycle life [1]. Lithium-ion batteries serve as a primary power source or additional power. Thus, they play a critical role in the reliability and safety of a system. Failure of these components may lead to loss of operation, a decrease of output, and even bring to a dangerous situation. To ensure the lithium-ion batteries in good condition, it is necessary to develop an accurate and reliable battery health monitoring program that involving prognostics to estimate its remaining useful life (RUL). RUL is defined as the time when the battery performance degrades to the failure threshold for the first time. If the RUL can be estimated accurately, a predictive maintenance program can be implemented. One of the RUL prediction methods is the data-driven approach. This method intends to model system behavior using regularly collected condition monitoring data instead of using comprehensive system physics or human expertise [2]. The data-driven approach does not require a precise mechanism of the system but uses the battery state of health data which can be measured through advanced sensor technology. This method extracts useful feature information and Materials Science Forum Submitted: 2017-10-27 ISSN: 1662-9752, Vol. 929, pp 93-102 Accepted: 2018-02-27 doi:10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.929.93 Online: 2018-08-27 Â© 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland All rights reserved.

(#112067319, Iowa State University, Ames, USA-06/01/19,10:51:41) constructs the degradation model to predict RUL. The data-driven method can be classified into three groups based on artificial intelligence, filtering, and stochastic process degradation respectively [3]. The first methodology based on artificial intelligence, in general, exploit the monitoring data to fit variable degradation model and calculate the RUL by extrapolating the variables to the failure threshold. Sample research in this category is the development of autoregressive models and their improvement to estimate battery RUL [4,5]. This method is straightforward and easy to realize, but it can not handle nonlinear degradation process accurately. So, other researchers propose neural network(NN) based to predict battery RUL that is having superior ability to approximate nonlinear process [6,7,8]. The NN can effectively reduce the prediction error, but it still needs a significant amount of training data and is prone to fall into a local minimum. Therefore, other researchers use support vector machine (SVM) to estimate the RUL of lithium-ion batteries [9,10,11,12]. The SVM is a learning system that uses a hypothesis of linear functions in a high dimensional feature space. However, the SVM has to choose the appropriate kernel function and only provides the point estimate value of RUL. Reflecting the uncertainty of estimation using this method is hard. Another learning machine, namely relevance vector machine (RVM) is introduced by scholars to reduce the number of associated vectors. The RVM method can perform point estimation and interval estimation [9,13,14,15]. The second methodology is based on the recursive Bayesian estimation which use Monte Carlo method to draw samples/particles from a posterior distribution and assigns a weight to each particle. Application of this approach can be found in [1,16,17,18,19,20]. This method can be used in any form of state-space model and give the best solution for non-linear, Gaussian and non-Gaussian system The main disadvantages of this filtering method are the need of state-space model which usually very subjective, and it only provides point estimated value of RUL. The third method is RUL prognostics based on the stochastic degradation process. This approach using a stochastic model to model a battery degradation data, and then infers and predicts the distribution of RUL. Many scholars have proposed stochastic process model likes Gaussian process and Wiener process to predict the RUL of lithium-ion batteries. For example, [21] used the combination of Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict battery RUL. [22] also used GPR combined with an Empirical model to enhance the accuracy of battery RUL prediction. [23] proposed battery RUL prediction based on the Wiener process with Measurement error. The RUL prognostics using this method consider the time-dependence of the degradation process and describe the uncertainty of prediction results. However, this approach involves higher calculation complexity and uncertain factors. Based on the above studies, it can be understood that the data-driven approach uses the degradation patterns of adequate samples reflecting equipment failure progression. The need for a lot of samples data is the primary challenge in data-driven prognostics since it is often not possible to obtain the sample of failure progressions. Furthermore, during their application, the lithium-ion batteries will experience charge, discharge, and standing status. The battery circulates between discharge and standing after every charging. When standing, due to diffusion effect, the ion concentration tends to balance, and the voltage rises, which will improve the battery life. It is called self-recharge phenomenon. Therefore, it is not easy to describe the dynamic performance of lithium-ion batteries in actual application. And the RUL prediction method of the batteries considering self-recharge phenomenon is still a challenging problem. This paper is aim to develop a data-driven approach to monitor the batteries state of health and predict their remaining useful life (RUL) in the case of limited battery degradation data and consider the self-recharge phenomenon in the battery degradation process. 94 Advanced Materials Research QiR 15 Methodology The RUL estimation based on battery capacity degradation data is investigated in this paper. A data generation technique to propagate the number of the degradation data was applied. This data was called target vector {z, x}. Vector z is the battery capacity data, and vector x is the corresponding cycle. The data were divided into training data and testing data. The LS-SVM learning process was performed on the training data. The learning process would yield the regression model and the support vectors. The pairs of support vectors and the corresponding cycle {z*, x*} were labeled as Support Vectors. Then a single exponential function was used to fit the Support Vectors, and RUL prediction was carried out by extrapolating the model until reach the end of life threshold. The prognostics flowchart is shown in Figure 1. Fig. 1. Flowchart of the RUL prediction. Experimental Battery Data. The lithium-ion battery data used in this paper was obtained from the data repository of the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence. This data set had been sampled from a battery prognostics testbed at NASA comprising commercially available Li-ion 18650 rechargeable batteries. The lithium-ion batteries were run through three different operational profiles (charge, discharge, and impedance) at room temperature. Charging was carried out in a constant current (CC) mode at 1.5 A until the battery voltage reached 4.2 V and then continued in a constant voltage (CV) mode until the charge current dropped to 20 mA. The discharge was carried out at a constant current (CC) level 2 A until the battery voltage fell to 2.7 V, 2.5 V, and 2.2 V for battery No. B0005, No. B0006, and No. B0007 respectively. Impedance measurement was conducted by an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) frequency sweep from 0.1 Hz to 5 kHz. Repeated charge and discharge cycle resulted in acceleration aging of the batteries [24]. In this study, the SOH of the lithium-ion battery was represented by the capacity degradation The measured capacity of the Batteries B0005, B0006, and B0007 during charge and recharge cycle are shown in Fig. 2. Materials Science Forum Vol. 929 95 Fig. 2. The battery capacity degradation data. From The Fig. 2 above, it can be seen that the batteries capacity undergo degradation abruptly since the initial cycle. However, after several cycles, the capacity will increase. This phenomenon is called self-charging or regeneration phenomenon. These happen in the cycle 20, 31, 48, 90, and 103/104. The capacity in these cycles is higher than the previous capacity. This phenomenon will affect the accuracy of the battery RUL prediction. So that, the cycles before the regeneration phenomenon occurs would be selected as the RUL prediction starting point to investigate the effect of the regeneration phenomenon to the RUL prediction. The capacity data was divided into training data and testing data. Training data were taken from the initial cycle until the starting point of the prediction, and the rest of the data are the testing data. Generating Target Vector. The LSSVM learning process was performed on the pair of vector {z, x}, where the input vector x was the cycle, and the target vector z was the battery capacity. The target vector z was produced by generating the corresponding random numbers that follow the Gaussian distribution with mean values equal to a series of capacity degradation and deviation standard equal to a certain pre-defined value. In this research, it was used 0.01. These target values indicating the battery degradation information were assumed to be known up to RUL prediction starting point. The starting points were chosen at the cycles before self-recharge phenomenon occurs. The LSSVM model was trained using a Gaussian kernel as the mapping feature space. Optimization of hyperparameter was done using simplex methods. After building the LSSVM model, the support vector values z* were found at the corresponding cycles x*. The pairs of feature data {z*,x*} were labeled as Support Vectors (SVs). Fitting and Extrapolating the Model. This paper adopts a single exponential function that was used in previous papers like [16,19,25] to fit the model. The function is expressed by an exponential growth model as follow: )exp( bta â=Î» (1) where a and b are the model parameters, t is the cycle and Î» is the battery capacity. This model was fitted to the pairs of support vectors {z*,x*}. The future evolution of degradation was predicted by extrapolating the fitted model along the cycles and the prediction stop when the predicted degradation curve reached the end of life threshold that was set between 25%-40% fade in initial capacity. Prediction Evaluation. The accuracy of RUL prediction is evaluated quantitatively to see the performance of the prediction. This paper use Error of RUL, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the measurement of prediction accuracy. They are defined as: predictionrealRUL RULRULE â= (2) 96 Advanced Materials Research QiR 15 â ï£º ï£» ï£¹ ï£¯ ï£° ï£® â = â = n i iin RMSE yy 1 2 1 (3) â = â= n i ii yy n MAE 1 1 (4) Here, n is the number of prediction data set, iy is the measured value of testing of the battery capacity, and iy is the prediction value. The RMSE of RUL prediction is expected below 0.5 to achieve accurate prediction Results and Discussion This paper estimates the SOH of the lithium-ion battery from the limited capacity degradation data and considering the self-recharge phenomenon. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that the event occurs at the cycle number of 20, 31, 48, 90, and 103/104 for batteries B0005, B0006, and B0007. The capacity at these cycles is higher than the previous cycle. Different RUL prediction starting points were evaluated to investigate this effect to the accuracy of the RUL prediction. The starting points were chosen at the cycle where the battery starts to undergo self-recharge phenomenon. They are cycle number 19, 30, 47, 89, and 102 for B0005 and B0007, and cycle 30, 47, 89, and 103 for B0006. In the Fig. 3 until the Fig. 7, the prediction results for battery B0005 are presented. The black spots represent the target data; the blue line is representative of the measured capacity degradation data, the green spots are the Support Vectors. The red line is the estimation of RUL starting from the cycle where the battery undergoes self-recharge phenomenon, the red dash-dot line is the 90 % prediction interval, and the black dash line is the end of life threshold. Form those figures; it can be seen that the prediction accuracy is going better after cycle 89. At this cycle, the batteries experience the highest capacity recovery, that is 0,0883 Ahr. This state is also found in the Battery B0006 and B0007. Therefore, it can be concluded that after cycle 89, the prediction accuracy will be better. Fig. 3.

RUL prediction of Battery B0005 at the starting point of the cycle 102. The error of RUL prediction is shown in Fig. 8. The Figure presents the RUL prediction error at different prediction starting point. At the initial cycle, the error is high (cycle 30). However, the prediction error decrease when the starting point of prediction shifted to cycle before highest capacity recovery occurs (cycle 89). After this cycle, the self-recharge phenomenon of the batteries just gives a small increase to the battery capacity (cycle 102). So that, the cycle 102/103 was chosen as the optimal RUL prediction starting point. Fig. 8. RUL prediction error at different prediction starting point. Materials Science Forum Vol. 929 99 Fig. 9.

The figures show that there are slight differences between actual RUL and the prediction. The battery degradation process is a nonlinear process and affected by many factors, like operating temperature and chemical process inside the battery. However, the RUL prediction result using fitted LS-SVM model give good accuracy. The summarized of the RUL prediction performance that started after the highest capacity recovery is provided in Table 1. Tabel 1. Prediction error.

All of the RMSE predictions are below 0.5. The highest accuracy is found in battery B0007 RUL prediction. They are 5 cycles, 0.0046, and 0.0095 for RUL error, RMSE, and MAE respectively. Conclusion This paper has presented the lithium-ion battery SOH estimation based on the data-driven approach using Gaussian distribution and LSSVM regression to overcome the limitation of available capacity degradation data. The capacity data was augmented by generating random numbers that follow the Gaussian distribution with mean values equal to serial capacity degradation values and variance of one. Then, LSSVM was used to model the degradation data. RUL prediction was carried out at the cycle where the battery undergoes regeneration phenomena by fitting the support vectors using a single exponential function. The result showed that the RUL starting point affected the accuracy of the RUL prediction. The good accuracy was achieved when the RUL prediction starts after the highest battery capacity recovery as the result of the self-recharge phenomenon. The error that represented by RMSE were found below 0.5 for all of the batteries. Although there are slight differences between the prediction RUL and the actual RUL, this proposed methods can be used to estimate the battery RUL for SOH monitoring, and maintenance scheduling purpose.
