In my case, my table saw and workbench are about 34\" off the ground, with a ceiling height of 99\" Therefore A = 99\"-34\" = 65\" or S50 » B - The distance between fixtures. This should ideally be the same: as A, orup fo 1.5 fimes A. Inmy case, that's 65\"-97\" (roughly 5-1/2\"-8') » C-The distance between a fixture and the wall. This should be no. more than one third fo one half of B. In my case, B=6, so C=2\"-3\".","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
