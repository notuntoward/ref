The mitigation strategies function at the material level, cell level, and system level. A time-sequence map with states and ﬂows that describe the evolution of the physical and/or chemical processes has been pro- posed to interpret the mechanisms, both at the cell level and at the system level. At the cell level, the time-sequence map helps clarify the relationship between thermal runaway and ﬁre. At the system level, the time-sequence map depicts the relationship between the expected thermal runaway propagation and the undesired ﬁre pathway. Mitigation strategies are fulﬁlled by cutting off a spe- ciﬁc transformation ﬂow between the states in the time sequence map. The abuse conditions that may trigger thermal runaway are also summarized for the complete protection of lithium-ion batteries. This perspective provides di- rections for guaranteeing the safety of lithium-ion batteries for electrical energy storage applications in the future. INTRODUCTION The world is becoming increasingly electriﬁed. Mobile electronics,1 transportation,2 and stationary energy storage3 are calling for better batteries. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) win over others because of their high energy density and long cycle life. To develop better LIBs, the safety problem, known as ‘‘thermal runaway (TR),’’4 must be overcome. Solutions to this problem are urgently required to pass the last mile for the application of high-energy LIBs; fortunately, there are several techniques that can help mitigate battery TR. A mitigation technique can function before, dur- ing, or after the triggering of TR, according to the timeline of the accident.5 Effective mitigation techniques can be realized by design, monitoring, and active control. Moreover, the mitigation technique should be able to function at the material level, cell level, module level, or system level. Importantly, good mitigation techniques always function according to the underlying mechanisms. This perspective summa- rizes the current-best knowledge of the TR of LIBs. It not only covers the comments in current literature but also suggests solutions to the TR problems of LIBs and points out the areas that should be further investigated. COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF BATTERY THERMAL RUNAWAY Figure 1 shows a common failure sequence in a battery system. TR is always triggered by various kinds of abuse, including mechanical abuse, electrical abuse, and thermal abuse. A latent defect may also evolve into a triggering factor during the cycle life. The TR of LIBs usually occurs with smoke, ﬁre, or explosion during the process of intense energy release. TR propagates from one initiating cell to its neighbors and can cause disastrous consequences at the system level. Herein, we focus on TR miti- gation strategies as our core information. Figures 2 and 3 show the TR mechanisms at the cell level and propose effective mitigation strategies according to the mecha- nisms. Figure 4 shows the mechanisms of TR propagation and proposes correlated Context & Scale Ensuring safety is the utmost priority in the applications of lithium-ion batteries in electrical energy storage systems. Frequent accidents with unclear failure mechanisms undermine the conﬁdence of the industry in utilizing lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, lithium-ion batteries have a unique failure problem, named ‘‘thermal runaway,’’ of which the mechanism is still unclear. Thermal runaway is associated with chemical reactions, short circuits, smoke, ﬁre, and explosion, making the situation more complicated than we can imagine. The real process that drives the failure hides behind deceptive observations. This perspective proposes mitigation strategies for the thermal runaway problem of lithium-ion batteries. The thermal runaway mechanism has been investigated using a time sequence map to the best of our knowledge. The state transition in the time sequence map clearly interprets the underlying mechanisms for all kinds of observations in thermal runaway tests. Effective mitigation strategies have been proposed based on the conscious understanding of the thermal runaway mechanisms. Fortunately, we can properly regulate the thermal runaway hazard and signiﬁcantly reduce Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 ª 2020 Elsevier Inc. 743 mitigation strategies at the system level. Figure 5 presents the abuse conditions of the LIB system and correlated mitigation strategies. The aim of TR mitigation is to enhance the thermal stability of LIBs, thereby reducing the consequent thermal haz- ard. Although there might be other factors that can induce safety issues, the thermal stability is what we concentrate on, because battery failure always results in temper- ature rise. The quantiﬁed characteristics of battery TR are essential for developing effective mitigation strategies. We recommend accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) as a proper technique for TR analysis because it can provide an adiabatic test environ- ment that focuses on measuring heat generation and excludes the inﬂuence of heat dissipation to the environment. The heat dissipation effect at the system level is shown in Figure 4. The repeatability of the ARC test is much better than those of other test methods. Figure 2 brieﬂy shows the procedure of an ARC test. The cell sample is placed inside the ARC chamber, where it is heated to the point of TR. The heating pro- cess conforms to a standard process named ‘‘heat-wait-seek.’’ The ARC system will follow the temperature of the test sample to provide an adiabatic test environment, called the ‘‘exotherm’’ mode, once it detects noticeable heat generation from the test sample. The ARC monitoring system records the signals, e.g., temperature and voltage, which are further used for analyzing the TR mechanisms.6 We have summa- rized the common characteristics of battery TR after reviewing the results of many battery samples.7 {T1, T2, T3}and themax{dT$dt\u00011} are the common characteristics of battery TR. T1 represents the onset temperature of abnormal heat generation, i.e., the moment at which the ARC system detects noticeable heat generation from the side reactions within the cell. T1 reﬂects the overall thermal stability of a battery cell. T2 is the triggering temperature of the battery TR. T2 is the tipping point that sep- arates the gradual temperature increase from the sharp temperature increase. The temperature increase rate, dT$dt\u00011, will change by several orders of magnitude after reaching T2. T3 is the maximum temperature during TR. The max{dT$dt\u00011} reﬂects the maximum heat release rate during TR, with positive correlations with the energy den- sity of the cell sample.7 The mitigation target of the battery TR is to increase T1 and T2, and decrease T3 and max{dT$dt\u00011}. MITIGATING THE THERMAL RUNAWAY HAZARD AT THE CELL LEVEL The accurate control of the TR hazard reliesonhavinganin-depthknowledge of the formation of the characteristic temperatures {T1, T2, T3}. We have already acquired Figure 1.

The concept of a thermodynamic system helps to categorize the individual physical and/or chemical processes according to the locations where they occur. The physical and/or chemical processes can occur inside or outside the cell case; therefore, we can redraw the TSM using the two-path pattern, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3Aout- lines the two-path pattern for interpreting the TR mechanism of LIBs. The IN path represents the thermal failure caused by the chemical reactions inside the cell, whereas the OUT path is for the smoke, ﬁre, or explosion outside the cell. TR mitiga- tion is achieved by regulating the time sequence through the pathways. First, we need to prepare the map for physical and/or chemical processes during TR and sub- sequently propose regulating approaches to mitigate the TR hazards at speciﬁc points. The region with warm colors in Figure 3B shows a detailed TSM for the TR of LIBs. The IN path grows from the bottom-up on the left side, showing the sequence of thermal failure inside the cell case. The OUT path grows on the right side, showing the sequence of vent, smoke, and ﬁre observed outside the cell case. The IN path determines the temperature rise of the cell, explaining the forma- tion mechanisms of {T1, T2, T3}. The IN path includes the isolated reactions at the cathode or anode, the redox reactions between the cathode and anode, and the in- ternal short circuit. The OUT path depicts the smoke, ﬁre, or explosion that can be observed from outside the cell case. The moment of rupture is crucial for the Figure 2. Common Characteristics of the Thermal Runaway of LIBs ARC provides adiabatic test conditions that help to acquire repeatable results of thermal runaway for LIBs. The cell sample is placed inside the chamber that heats the battery to thermal runaway. The monitoring system of ARC records temperature, temperature rate, and voltage during thermal runaway. Three characteristic temperatures {T1, T2, T3} are regarded as the most important features of battery thermal runaway. T1 represents the loss of thermal stability, T2 denotes the triggering temperature, and T3 is the maximum temperature that a cell can reach during thermal runaway. The maximum dT$dt\u00011 reﬂects the maximum heat release rate during thermal runaway. Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 745746 Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 development of the OUT path. The rupture, which is mainly caused by electrolyte leakage, is the essential condition required for smoke, ﬁre, and explosion. The IN path summarizes the physical and/or chemical processes inside the cell from the ambient temperature to the TR orderly. T1 is formed when the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) starts to decompose.7 Usually, the SEI decomposition and regener- ation drive the temperature from T1 to T2 for lithium-ion cells with a graphite anode. The formation of T2 can be explained by the ‘‘cask effect,’’ i.e., the weakest among the cathode, anode, and separator determines the formation of T2.As wealready know, the main heat released during TR comes from the redox reactions between the cathode and anode (the state TR-V in Figure 3B); the speciﬁc process at T2 acts similar to a detonator that triggers the main reaction. To date, the known det- onators include (1) the internal short circuit caused by the collapse of the separator,7 (2) the highly reactive oxygen released from the LiNixCoyMnzO2 cathode,11 and (3) the plated active lithium on the anode surface caused by improper charging.12 At this point, we believe it might be essential to explain the new interpretation of the formation of T2. Previously, it was believed that the TR is always detonated by the internal short circuit. This is not wrong, because, previously, the triggering temper- ature of the states TR-III (for the cathode) and TR-IV (for the anode) (shown in Fig- ure 3B) was considerably higher than that of the internal short circuit (TR-II in Fig- ure 3B). In recent years, as the collapse temperature of the separator signiﬁcantly increases while the utilization rate and the energy density of the cathode and the anode are further exploited by the industry, we gradually see the ‘‘trident’’ of the TR detonator, as shown in Figure 3B. Extreme fast charging that may feed a battery within 15 min may lead to the massive lithium plating. T1 will signiﬁcantly reduce to 60\u0003Corlower,13 once a large amount of lithium is plated on the anode surface. Some of the recent accidents have indicated that the cause is likely the lithium plating un- der fast charging. This reminds us of the E-One Moli’s tragedy in the 1980s. The per- formance of lithium-ion cells with the anode surface covered by plated lithium can have similar characteristics as that of lithium cells. Conversely, the utilization of a high-nickel-content cathode greatly reduces the temperature of the released oxy- gen.14 The industry should be aware of the ‘‘TR-trident,’’ as shown in Figure 3B, despite considering that more time is required for previous knowledge to pass on. Finally, the redox reactions between T2 and T3 also generate a large amount of gases. The gases burst out with the active materials coated on the current collectors, because the aluminum current collector may melt at 660\u0003C. The OUT path summarizes the phenomenon, e.g., swell, rupture, smoke, ﬁre, or ex- plosion, which can be observed during the TR tests. The cell rupture, which is critical Figure 3. Thermal Runaway States of LIB Cell and Correlated Mitigation Strategies (A) An outline of the battery thermal runaway mechanisms and the thought of time sequence regulation. A cell can transit from normal condition to failure condition through two paths. The IN path is for the thermal failure caused by chemical reactions inside the cell, whereas the OUT path is for the smoke, ﬁre, or explosion outside the cell. A proposed idea to mitigate battery thermal runaway is to schedule and regulate the time sequence of the dual paths. (B) A detailed ﬁgure of Figure 3A. The vertical axis (in red) links with the characteristic temperatures as deﬁned in Figure 2. The lean axis (in orange) links with the thermo-physical temperatures of the solvent with multiple components. Each node (a prismatic battery cell) that locates within the sector represents a unique state (check Table 1 for details if interested) during the thermal runaway process. The left path (IN path) shows the sequence of thermal failure inside the cell case until thermal runaway occurs. The right path (OUT path) shows the sequence of vent, smoke, and ﬁre observed outside the cell case, of which the observation can be explained by the ﬁre triangle. The code that sits on the shoulder of node denotes the name of the state. The preﬁx TR means the thermal runaway within the cell case, V means venting, and F means ﬁre. The arrows between nodes refer to the state transitions, some of which can be cut off by proper mitigation strategies. The red dotted lines link the underlying mechanisms with the measured characteristic temperatures {T1, T2, T3}. The mitigation target is to increase T1 and T2 and decrease T3. The blue scissors denote the critical points where we can cut off the paths before thermal runaway. The blue dotted lines link the speciﬁc mitigation methods (on the side of the ﬁgure) with the cutoff point where they function. Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 747748 Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 for the OUT path, occurs when the inner pressure exceeds the preset open pressure of the vent valve. The gas that accumulates inside the cell is generated from two sources: (1) the gasiﬁcation of carbonate solvents and (2) the side reactions. A recent study15 and our results indicate that the gasiﬁcation of solvents is the major source of gas before T2 is reached, whereas the second gas source, the side reactions, will dominate the ﬁrst source of gas after T2 is reached. The internal pressure of the bat- tery cell will increase when the temperature exceeds the boiling point of any of the components in the binary or ternary solvents. It is easy for the vaporized solvents to erupt and be exhausted from a pouch cell (usually without a vent valve) once the in- ternal pressure increases. A hard-case cell with a vent valve can hold for a while until the inner pressure exceeds the opening pressure. Therefore, the rupture tempera- ture for the pouch cells will be near the boiling point of the carbonate that vaporizes ﬁrst, whereas that for the hard-case cells will be higher. The battery cell swells (the state V-I/F-I in Figure 3B) before the gas is exhausted. The ﬁre triangle might be satisﬁed once the ﬂammable gas vents from the cell package. Thus far, an observant reader may have realized that there might be no close relationship between TR and ﬁre. The evolving paths of the TR and ﬁre move forward in parallel conditions as in Figure 3B. However, in fact, it is the TR that generates a large amount of heat, which is one of the three factors in the ﬁre triangle; it is the temperature rise owing to TR that stimulates the rupture of the cell, and it is the sparks generated during the high-speed venting that ignite the ﬂammable gases. TR is the root cause of smoke, ﬁre, and explosion for LIBs. It is worth mentioning that the oxygen released from the cathode is insufﬁcient for the complete combustion of the ﬂammable electrolytes;5 therefore, combustion will not occur inside the battery cell during the TR process. The OUT path can help explain the mechanisms of the observations in the failure tests. Multi-stage jet ﬁres have been observed in recent researches,16 and they can be attributed to the multi-stage venting of individual components of solvents, as the electrolyte of commercial LIBs usually contains two or more component sol- vents, which have different boiling points. There might be one jet ﬁre when one sol- vent reaches its boiling point. In this way, at least 3 jet ﬁres can be observed for a LIB with ternary solvents. The small organic molecules that burst during the TR process between T2 and T3 can also be ignited to form additional jet ﬁre. Therefore, theoret- ically, there might be 4 jet ﬁres for LIBs with a ternary electrolyte system. However, no more than3jet ﬁres are observedinexperiments, because the jet ﬁres can combine depending on the characteristic temperatures. Speciﬁcally, the boiling points of ordinary carbonates that are used as solvents can be quite similar (DMC 90\u0003C, EMC 108\u0003C, and DEC 128\u0003C), and the vent valve may hold for a while after a boiling point is reached; therefore, the jet ﬁres at approximate 100\u0003C–130\u0003C Figure 4. Thermal Runaway States of LIB Pack and Correlated Mitigation Strategies (A) An outline of the battery thermal runaway propagation mechanisms and the thought of time sequence regulation. Two paths connect the normal condition and the disastrous failure. One path is for the thermal propagation mainly controlled by heat transfer, whereas another path is for the ﬁre propagation controlled by the ﬁre triangle. Path transition is possible when gas migration, integrity loss, and ﬁre ignition are triggered. The lower path is relatively easier to control than the upper path. Therefore, we call the lower path as ‘‘expected,’’ whereas we call the upper path ‘‘undesired.’’ (B) A detailed ﬁgure of Figure 4A. The horizontal axis (in gray) refers to the expected failure sequence, which is considered during the safety design of battery pack. The lean axis (in orange) refers to the undesired ﬁre hazard during the failure propagation within a battery pack. Each node (a battery pack or module) that locates within the sector represents a unique state during the thermal runaway propagation process. The horizontal path shows the expected sequence of thermal runaway propagation, which initiates from cell, propagates to the module, and ﬁnally spreads to the whole battery pack. The upper path shows the undesired ﬁre hazard that may occur at pack level, of which the mechanism can be explained by the ﬁre triangle. The upper path is also connected by the ﬂow (purple line) originated from the ﬁre triangle. The code on the shoulder of the node denotes the name of the state. In addition to the preﬁx in Figure 3, the additional preﬁx P means the state is for the pack level. The arrows between nodes refer to the state transitions, some of which can be cut off by proper mitigation strategies. The blue scissors denote the critical points where we can cut off the paths toward more severe hazards at pack level. The blue dotted lines link the speciﬁc mitigation methods (on the blue region at the side of the ﬁgure) with the cutoff point at which they function. Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 749750 Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 may combine. Moreover, the boiling point of EC (250\u0003C) is close to or higher than an ordinary T2; therefore, the jet ﬁre caused by EC venting will combine with that caused by TR. Regardless of the number of jet ﬁres, the multi-stage jet ﬁres present serious troubles for the ﬁre-ﬁghting of LIBs. The stored ﬁre extinguisher may be largely consumed to wipe out the ﬁrst jet ﬁre, being insufﬁcient when another jet ﬁre starts. Some reports refer to the multi-stage ﬁre as the troublesome ‘‘re-igni- tion,’’ but we believe that the underlying mechanisms should be explained by the TSM, as shown in Figure 3B. Although the ﬁrst jet ﬁre is extinguished in the OUT path, the IN path still evolves and heats the cell to a considerably high temperature, at which point another jet ﬁre would start. In summary, the TSM advises that the ﬁre- extinguishing process of the LIBs must consider not only the ﬁre in the OUT path but also the synergistic inhibition of the chemical reactions in the IN path. The IN path and OUT path meet (at the top of Figure 3B) when the venting becomes intense during the TR. Black smoke has been observed in several TR cases. The TSM also helps to explain the mechanisms of the color of smoke observed in most exper- iments. The black smoke, which contains a large amount of the active materials at the cathode, indicates that the inner temperature of the lithium-ion cell exceeds the melting point (660\u0003C) of the aluminum collector. White or gray smoke usually occurs at the earlier state V-II or V-III (in Figure 3B), because the major content of the smoke is the vapor of the electrolyte. The thick particles that rush out during the violent venting at the state V-IV may blow out the ﬁre because they may isolate oxygen from the ﬂammable gases for a while. Re-ignition is possible when the venting stops. Sometimes re-ignition inside a lithium-ion cell is possible because the IN and OUT systems merge; consequently, the hot ﬂammable debris inside the cell can encounter air. Precise TR mitigation can be achieved once the TR mechanisms depicted by the TSM have been fully understood, as shown in the blue region at the side of Figure 3B. The quantiﬁed mitigation target of battery TR is to increase T1 and T2 and decrease T3 and max{dT$dt\u00011}. The prevention strategy can be chemical, mechanical, electrical, or thermal, as long as it can inhibit the triggering process, as shown in Figure 3B. A more stable SEI, which can be obtained using electrolyte additives,17 is beneﬁcial for increasing T1. Considering the TR-trident for increasing T2, we should balance the three failure temperatures by coordinated strategies. To postpone the occurrence of state TR-II, a strong separator with a high resistance against the shrinkage at high temperatures, i.e., a separator with ceramic coating18 and separators coated with boron nitride nanotubes,19 might be helpful. Another effective method involves increasing the internal resistance of the lithium-ion cell once a short circuit occurs.20 Additionally, we can use thermo-responsive polymer switching materials at the transition temperature to shut down the circuit for internal short.21 To cope with the state TR-III, blocking the release pathway by coating22,23 is intuitively employed Figure 5. Abuse Conditions of LIB System and Correlated Mitigation Strategies (A) The relationship between abuse conditions and battery thermal runaway. Besides the mechanical, electrical, and thermal abuse, there might be a new kind of abuse condition named the ‘‘electrochemical abuse’’ that explains the underlying abuse conditions that trigger thermal runaway. (B) A detailed ﬁgure of Figure 5A. From left to right, the abuse conditions can be classiﬁed by mechanical abuse, electrical abuse, and thermal abuse. From bottom to top, the abuse conditions are for material, cell, module, pack, and vehicle. Each node (material, cell, module, pack, or vehicle) that locates within the sector represents a unique abuse condition (or we can also call it ‘‘state’’) that may further trigger thermal runaway. The code on the shoulder of the node denotes the name of the abuse conditions. The preﬁx M means mechanical abuse, E means electrical abuse, and T means thermal abuse. The arrows between nodes represent the evolution of a failure from initiation to thermal runaway. We may have speciﬁc strategies to avoid the occurrence of individual abuse conditions. The speciﬁc mitigation strategies that are placed at side have been connected with the correlated abuse conditions through dotted lines, of which the end is marked by a green or red dot. The green dot means that the abuse condition has been considered in some of the test regulations or standards, whereas the red dot means that the abuse condition has not been considered in any of the test regulation or standard yet. Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 751 to mitigate the oxygen release from the cathode; however, occasionally, good coating requires an in-depth study of the validity throughout the life cycle. We want a technique that can immediately capture the active oxygen once it is released from the cathode surface; however, we still do not have a speciﬁc solution. Changing the secondary structure from a polycrystalline to a single-crystal morphology might help because it reduces the surface area for oxygen release. To improve the thermal stability of the anode (for manipulating the state TR-IV), electrolyte additives are required to improve the strength of the SEI against thermal stability issues17 and to improve the uniformity of the SEI to suppress dendrite growth.24 Coating the anode with Al2O3 may also be useful for suppressing the dendrite growth, but still with lithium deposition under the coated layer.25 We want to decrease both the maximum temperature (T3) and the heat release rate (max{dT$dt\u00011}) in the state TR-V and TR-VI. The directive involves neutralizing the oxidantand reductant for relatively mild reactions to occur during the TR. A new concept, which we refer to as the ‘‘self-poisoned’’ technique, might be helpful in reducing the total energy release or diminishing the heat release rate.20 Current literature has some good works on the cell design with the ‘‘self-poisoned’’ function, including (1) the use of thermo-responsive materials to block the contact between the cathode and anode26,27 and (2) isolating the damaged area by the structural design of current col- lectors.28 A course setting ‘‘self-poisoned’’ technique was proposed by Liu et al., us- ing an electrospun separator with a core-shell structure containing a ﬂame-retardant liquid within the microﬁber.29 We believe that more on the ‘‘self-poisoned’’ technique will appear under the guid- ance of the TSM in the near future. For the ﬁre-extinguishing process at the OUT path, prevention strategies are suggested to focus on breaking the ﬁre triangle. First, we need to properly design a vent valve that can control the moment of rupture at a proper temperature. Diluting the ﬂammable gases into an extreme lean zone us- ing inertia gases might be helpful.30 The battery cells can be wrapped by inertia gases in their practical applications as well. Flame retardants can be added into the electrolyte31 or nonﬂammable electrolyte.32,33 However, occasionally, the ﬂame retardants may have a negative effect on the performances of LIBs. Recent research shows that nonﬂammable electrolytes with high salt-to-solvent ratios might be good for balancing the safety and performance of LIBs.34 Increasing the thermal stability of electrolyte can also help improve the safety of LIBs. A shift in the venting schedule can be achieved by solvent replacement, and this can signiﬁcantly help regulate the start time of the ﬁre. We should note that the sequence of failure events at the cell level might be more complicated than what is being presented in the TSM. There are still many trivial fac- tors that are sensitive to the TR behavior but not included in the TSM. Although equipped with the TSM, we still need well-trained industrial practitioners to properly perform the mitigation strategy and design a good cell. Moreover, the mitigation strategies described above should have a negligible effect on the performances of the LIBs and be cost-effective. This explains why more mitigation strategies are being developed at the system level rather than at the cell level. TR mitigation at the system level is beneﬁcial and critical for the safe utilization of LIBs. MITIGATING THE THERMAL RUNAWAY PROPAGATION AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL At the system level, TR occurs in one cell, after which it propagates to adjacent cells, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4A shows that the TR propagation also occurs via two 752 Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 pathways for the failure development, similar to the dual paths in Figure 3.Anex- pected failure sequence indicates the TR propagation driven by heat transfer, as shownby the gray arrowinthe lowerpathin Figure 4A. An undesired failure sequence indicates the TR propagation caused by gas and ﬁre propagations, as shown by the red arrow in the upper path in Figure 4A. We call the lower path ‘‘ex- pected,’’ because the blocking of heat transfer is relatively easy. The upper path is called ‘‘undesired,’’ because the propagation of gas and ﬁre has uncertainties, which make it difﬁcult to prevent the failure propagation via this pathway. The failure states may migrate from the lower path to the upper path, once the following conditions are satisﬁed: (1) gas migration, (2) integrity loss, and (3) ﬁre ignition. To mitigate the TR propagation at the system level, we would prefer to restrict the failure prop- agation at the lower path. Figure 4B illustrates a detailed TSM for the TR propagation at the system level. The expected failure sequence should be the horizontal path, as shown in Figure 4B. First, TR propagates within a battery module, from the triggering cell to its neigh- bors (state P-TR-II). Second, the TR propagates from the failure module to adjacent modules (state P-TR-III). If the speed of TR propagation can be well controlled, no catastrophic hazard will occur, and we can expect venting to occur through the safety valve. The hazard is acceptable under this case, even with ﬁre. The expected failure sequence may transit to the undesired ﬁre hazard in practical applications. The ﬁrst transition point (from the expected path to the undesired path) may commence after TR is triggered. The inappropriate design of vent valve and the pack wrap, i.e., where the pressure resistivity of the pack wrap is lower than that of the vent valve, results in unexpected venting, where the gas does not merge from the vent valve. Vented ﬂammable gases may be ignited spontaneously once the ﬁre triangle requirement is satisﬁed. The second transition point (from the expected path to the undesired path) may commence when TR propagates from module to module. Some observa- tions in the pack test indicate that the cells in the adjacent modules may undergo TR simultaneously, due to the highly intense side heating. The high-intensity heat released at the second transition point increases the possibility of transfer from the expected path to the undesired path, comparing with that case at the ﬁrst tran- sition point. In other words, controlling the TR at the system level becomes highly difﬁcult when more energy is released during the TR propagation. The slope line (as shown in Figure 4B) concludes the failure sequence under the undesired ﬁre haz- ard. Please note that the process in the horizontal path still goes on, although the undesired ﬁre hazard has been initiated. The two paths move forward in parallel di- rections, accelerating each other using the energy released from the TR propaga- tion. The heat release by ﬁre is larger than that by TR; consequently, the evolving speed of the two paths will be signiﬁcantly accelerated once the sloping path pro- cess starts. If the TR propagation is not well controlled, the two paths will merge at state ‘‘P-F-III’’ (in Figure 4B), at which point the battery pack deﬂagrates and ﬁnally burns the vehicle (state P-F-IV). Controlling the speed of TR propagation in the expected failure sequence (the hor- izontal path in Figure 4B) is more fundamental in the TR mitigation at the system level. Therefore, we want more countermeasures against the initiation of TR. Anti- abuse designs are presented in Figure 5. The mitigation design usually incorporates the safety design requirements for battery thermal management systems. We need to manipulate the heat-transfer pathway to inhibit the TR propagation between adja- cent cells. Effective methods include thermal insulation, reinforced heat dissipation, and fast discharge adjacent cells to lower state of charge.35 Setting thermal barriers between cells and modules is the cost-effective solution mitigating the TR Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 753 propagation between cells and modules. Thermal barriers can be made using perlite, glass ﬁber, ceramic plate, rock wool panel, calcium silicate, silica aerogel,35 graphite composite sheet, Al extrusion,36 phase change materials,37 etc. The ther- mal barriers must have low thermal conductivity (<0.1 W$m\u00011$K\u00011)and high working temperature (>600\u0003C) to maintain integrity at TR conditions. The effect of thermal insulation will be enhanced, if the thermal barrier can absorb a large amount of heat. The heat absorption can be achieved using materials with high heat capacity or using phase change materials. We may require composite materials that have comprehensive properties, e.g., some components for maintaining the integrity at high temperatures, and some others for heat insulation or absorption. It is still difﬁ- cult to cope with the dilemma of heat dissipation (for battery thermal management) and thermal insulation (for TR propagation prevention). However, safety design must consider the inﬂuence of the operation mode of the battery thermal management system on the mitigation capability of TR propagation.38 The industry is acquiring solutions that employ accessories in the thermal management system, e.g., side panel, cooling plate, cover board, etc. Occasionally, cooling plates have negative effects on the prevention of TR propagation because their contribution to heat con- duction might be larger than their contribution to heat dissipation. Model-based tools are urgently required to solve the nexus of TR propagation prevention,39 as ex- periments or tests are expensive, and always have low repeatability. Moreover, we wish to note that the design parameters for the prevention strategies that are used in the expected failure sequence should be determined with repeated proof and revision to avoid the catastrophe associated with the undesired sloping path. The ﬁrst shift point from the expected path to the undesired path can be cut off by setting a predetermined failure point to control the venting of hot gases.40 The target can be achieved by proper design of the vent valve and strengthening of the package to eliminate the weakest point. There is no speciﬁc approach to control- ling the second transition point; however, the TR should always propagate at mild speed. The prevention of ﬁre hazard at the system level inherits some approaches from that at the cell level (as in Figure 3B). Available countermeasures include using ﬁre-resistant materials to protect the accessories within the battery pack, diluting the ﬂammable gas with inertia gas into the extreme lean zone, wrapping the battery cell with inertia gases (e.g., N2 or Ar2), using ﬂame retardants to inhibit reactions that are related with ﬁre, introducing an explosive powder that can spread the ﬂame retar- dants rapidly, and other methods that can extinguish ﬁre outside the cell. Addition- ally, to protect passengers, ﬁre-resistant layers might be essential to insulate the battery pack from the cabin. In summary, a cell with a relatively higher energy density can still be used as long as TR can be prevented at the system level. At the system level, the failure propagation is coupled with heat generation and heat transfer under a large temperature gradient. Failure propagates not by simple heat transfer but by heat-reaction- coupled transfer. Mitigation strategies involve cutting off the heat-reaction-coupled transfer among the battery cells. Sometimes we need to combine methods to cope with the intense energy released during TR. For instance, thermal insulation not only blocks the heat transfer but also causes heat accumulation within a limited region. There should be a correlated dredging design to disperse the accumulated heat, similar to a diversion channel employed in auxiliary dams to control ﬂood. Model- based tools are essential for the safety design of battery thermal management systems considering both the prevention of TR propagation and heat dissipation. Intensive efforts should be devoted to restricting the propagation in the horizontal path, as shown in Figure 4B, because some cases in the sloping path with ﬁre might 754 Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 be uncontrollable. The mitigation strategies based on anti-explosion and ﬁre-extin- guishing theories might help handle the undesired ﬁre hazard; however, the unique feature of battery TR needs to be considered. Eliminating or reducing the origin of TR is also important. Anti-abuse strategies will be described in the next section. AVOIDING THE OCCURRENCE OF THERMAL RUNAWAY The goal of the safety design of battery systems is to reduce the possibility of abuse, eliminate abuse once it occurs, and create TR alert systems at the earliest stage. An effective mitigation strategy that helps avoid the occurrence of TR is founded on the mechanisms of abuse conditions. Figure 5 attempts to clarify the nexus of abuse conditions. Figure 5Ashows that almost all kinds of abuse conditions can be classiﬁed into three, including mechan- ical abuse, electrical abuse, and thermal abuse. It is considerably easy to simulate the three kinds of abuse conditions using test methods (those in standards or regu- lations). However, in recent years, the test standards keep falling behind due to the emerging new chemistries, e.g., high-nickel-content cathode, anode containing sil- icon composite, thinner separators, etc., which is challenging. The lag of the test standards can also be caused by the excessive utilization of the LIBs to full capability, e.g., extremely fast charging, extra-low- or extra-high-temperature operation, etc. We should be aware that there is an ever-lasting abuse type underneath the mechan- ical, electrical, and thermal abuse; this abuse is called the ‘‘electrochemical abuse.’’ The electrochemical abuse occurs when we force the cell to work beyond its capa- bility in electrochemical power outputs. When we develop cells with new chemis- tries, the safe working window may become narrow, which increases the occurrence possibility of ‘‘electrochemical abuse.’’ In addition, we are forcing the cell to work beyond maximum capacity under speciﬁc conditions, making the cell reach its limit of safe operation. Figure 5B illustrates the details of the abuse conditions that contain various sub-con- ditions. The abuse states (as shown in Figure 5B) may transfer from one to others until TR occurs. A mechanical abuse will develop into an electrical abuse, while an elec- trical abuse may develop into a thermal abuse, which ﬁnally triggers TR. For instance, cell crushing (mechanical abuse) will lead to internal short circuiting (electrical abuse) and the heat (thermal abuse) generated by the internal short circuit triggers TR. If the state transfer is faster than we can identify, the TR will be seemingly triggered by an abuse condition rather than by the thermal abuse. Regardless of the type of abuse condition, T2 and the TSM are waiting there for the triggering of TR. However, there are still ‘‘ghost’’ failures that trigger TR, but we lack information on them. Some re- searchers believe that these ‘‘ghost’’ failures might be caused by a ‘‘latent effect’’ that evolves during operation. The ‘‘latent effect’’ throughout the whole cycle life re- quires more study in the future. Figure 5B shows that the abuse conditions can occur at the system level, module level, cell level, or material level. The abuse state also transfers from the system level to the material level. For mechanical abuse, a car crash causes deformation of the battery pack, which, consequently, deforms the battery module, within which the cell is crushed. A crushed cell will exhibit internal short-circuiting once the sepa- rator (at the material level) fails to isolate the cathode and anode. For electrical abuse, representative causes include improper charging, water immersion, and external short-circuiting as representatives. Improper charging includes overcharg- ing or improper fast charging that may cause lithium plating on the anode. Water Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 755 immersion will lead to external short-circuiting, accompanied by the generation of ﬂammable gases.41 Interestingly, the ﬂammable gases mainly originate from the leaked electrolyte, rather than the hydrogen generated during water electrolysis.41 For thermal abuse, a known case involved joint loose, which caused overheating. All the other kinds of abuse conditions may ﬁnally develop into thermal abuse, which directly heats the battery to extremely high temperatures. The above abuse condi- tions can easily be characterized at the cell level, where the test standards or regu- lations have more correlated procedures for a safety check. The test regulations/standards, which are usually set up by governments or organi- zations to guarantee the quality of the product before sale, are useful to reduce the possibility of ﬁeld accidents. We should be aware that formulating proper test stan- dards or regulations is always important, particularly considering that the battery in- dustry strongly prefers high-performance materials, which are the most dangerous, and this is not likely to change in the near future. The question is, how can we formu- late proper testing methods that are suitable for guaranteeing safety during appli- cations but are not overly harsh to exclude ‘‘high-energy’’ LIBs? Studies have shown that some abuse methods lead to softer failures than others. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have shown that internal short circuit testing can be used to induce worst- case failure scenarios.42,43 This is quite good and should be adopted in the update of new test standards, although it does not mean that the internal short circuit test can replace the other kinds of abuse tests. As shown in Figure 5B, there are many kinds of abuse conditions that may ﬁnally trigger TR, and an internal short circuit is only one of them. It would be unreasonable to believe that a cell that passes a single abuse test (e.g., nail penetration) will surely have good overall safety in applications. To ascertain the safety of a newly developed cell, comprehensive test reports must be provided for all kinds of abuse conditions that are written in the granted test standards. A good test method must reﬂect all the comprehensive properties that are important in practical applications.44 In our view, to guarantee the overall safety of LIBs, all the abuse conditions that have triggered battery accidents should be included in the testing standards. Although the test procedures cannot simulate the exact trig- gering conditions in various accidents, they can be set with proper simpliﬁcation as long as they can reﬂect the worst case of ﬁeld failures. Despite the requirement of simulating ﬁeld failures, a standard test procedure must have good repeatability and reproducibility.45 The green dots in Figure 5B denote that the current standard tests already consider these marked kinds of abuse conditions. It is due to these standards that billions of commercial electronics, millions of electric vehicles, and hundreds of electric energy storage stations can operate safely for years. However, new kinds of abuse conditions have emerged secretly at the material level when the industry requires better performances in applications. For instance, the search for low costing raw material has pushed the battery industry to select cath- odes with a substantially high nickel content3; however, the thermal stability of a cell with a high-nickel-content cathode reduces signiﬁcantly when we look at x R 0.8inLi(NixCoyMnz)O2. Another example emerged recently when some entrepre- neurs started to provide extreme fast charging for their customers. In our recent re- sults, the T1 of the cell after extreme fast charging can decrease from 100\u0003Cto 60\u0003C (T2 from 210\u0003Cto100\u0003C).12 The signiﬁcant decrease in thermal stability is caused by the lithium plating under the extreme fast charging because the plated lithium is highly reactive with the electrolyte. Moreover, the internal short circuit is another 756 Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 problem. Spontaneous internal short circuit will appear when we cram more active materials within a cell without suitable separators.46 We use green and red dots to distinguish the abuse conditions, ascertaining if they are included in test regula- tions/standards. Oxygen release, dendrite growth, and internal short circuit (inter- estingly the arms of the TR-trident in Figure 3, and all at the material level) are the three emerging problems that hide behind macro abuse conditions. These are the initiators of ‘‘electrochemical abuse,’’ as mentioned in Figure 5A. Speciﬁc counter- measures are in urgent need to cope with the possible hazard caused by the TR- trident. Fortunately, experts in electric vehicle safety-global technical regulation (EVS-GTR), International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Interna- tional Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) are working on correlated test procedures to consider the emerging danger. We can trust the battery industry to deliver safe products in the near future, thanks to the ever-evolving standards. The evolving test standards can catch up to the progress in cell chemistries and utilization strate- gies, as long as the standard formulators are conscious about the ‘‘electrochemical abuse’’ that is underneath the observed abuse conditions. To accurately handle the ‘‘electrochemical abuse,’’ one should always have a clear understanding of the safe working window of the components within the LIBs. Anti-abuse strategies can function at the stage of product design or at the stage of online management. Package design is critical for reducing the severity of the inter- nal short circuit in a car crash situation. The key target of anti-mechanical-abuse stra- tegies is to avoid large deformation that further induces short circuits, as listed in Table 1 for the M-series states. Anti-collision strategies should consider both the crashworthiness and lightweight of the on-board components of electric vehicles.47 More rigid structures, energy adsorption structures, and proper displacement of the battery cells are the three useful ways to fortify the battery pack against mechanical abuse. Besides the countermeasures for crush cases (state M-I\u0004M-IV in Figure 5B), the TR hazard of nail penetration (state M-V in Figure 5B) can also be mitigated by structures with side-current pathway, ﬁrst proposed by Samsung SDI.48 Leakage (state M-VI in Figure 5B) is an annoying case that is caused by the rupture of cell pack- ages. Fire or explosion is possible once ﬂammable gases leak from inside the cells, as previously discussed in Figures 3 and 4. Volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors might be essential for the fault diagnosis on-board49; however, to date, only a few products can meet the requirements for long-term vehicle applications. The key target of anti-electrical-abuse strategies is to control the electrical energy ﬂow and the electrochemical material ﬂow safely. Charging control is critical for the safe use of LIBs. For overcharging, an active control strategy in the battery man- agement system (BMS) should cut off the circuit once the voltage exceeds the limit, whereas a passive control strategy relies a current interrupting device52 that can shut down the charging circuit once gas accumulates inside the cell during overcharge. For extreme fast charging that may cause lithium plating, we need a model-based control algorithm that can adjust the real-time current to guarantee that the anode overpotential is always higher than the threshold potential for lithium plating.53 The model-based control algorithm should be capable of observing the anode overpo- tential online. The anode overpotential can also be directly measured by the refer- ence electrode, on which we can rely to calibrate the MAP for the fastest charging. The MAP for the fastest charging suggests that there is no fast charging proﬁle without lithium plating. Although the reference electrode still has the problem of longevity, the method for the quick calibration of the charging MAP is spreading in the industry. Heating is also helpful for reducing the problem of lithium plating. Yang et al.61 accomplished good example of fast charging by proper fast heating, Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 757 Table 1.

Once lithium plating oc- curs, there are several approaches that can evaluate the amount of plated lithium. Ofﬂine evaluation of plated lithium can rely on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)54 or neutron diffraction.55 Recent progress shows the possibility of using titra- tion gas chromatography and cryogenic electron microscopy to quantify the plated lithium in cells.56 Online evaluation of the plated lithium is also possible through a characteristic voltage plateau.57 Moreover, an external short circuit should be avoided in applications. Water immersion may cause an external short circuit with a lightning arc that may pierce the cell cases, resulting in leakage of ﬂammable elec- trolytes.41 The level of waterprooﬁng is recommended to be IP6X (X R 7).

For online detection, algorithms can be developed relying on voltage, temperature, or other signals measured by BMS.60 aPlease note that the more important thing is to know the mechanisms of battery TR. We have not checked the validity of all the listed countermeasures in our lab, and some of them may be still far away from industry application, but we believe that they may shed light on the directions that we can explore in the future. There is a wish, there is a way. Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 763 terminating the circuit under overcurrent cases, although, occasionally, but some- times they do not work as expected.62 The internal short circuit occurs in more than 90% of the abuse conditions. Broadly speaking, the internal short circuit occurs when the cathode and the anode encounter each other due to the failure of the battery separator.5 The internal short circuit can be caused by (1) mechanical abuse, when the separator is broken by pene- tration or crush; (2) electrical abuse, when the separator is pierced by dendrite growth; and (3) thermal abuse, when the separator collapses at a high temperature. The BMS should be able to identify the possibility of a short circuit at an early stage, armed with model-based fault diagnosis algorithms. For ofﬂine detection, the open- circuit voltage or the self-discharge current59 is helpful. For online detection, methods can be built relying on the voltage, temperature, or other signals measured by the BMS.60 A fault diagnosis algorithm with combined information of the internal short circuits, ﬂammable gases, and pressure inside the pack will be capable of iden- tifying TR at an early stage.63 New sensors might provide alternatives for the internal short circuit detection, e.g., Wu et al.64 demonstrated the usage of a bifunctional separator to provide a new signal that can help identify dendrite growth before it de- velops into an internal short circuit. The target of anti-thermal-abuse strategies is to control the temperature of LIBs in a safe operating zone. The temperature control task is usually shouldered by the ther- mal management system. Nonﬂammable materials can be utilized for ﬁreproof design, under cases with external combustions. A typical kind of thermal abuse is the overheating caused by the weakened contact of connecting bars. The contact resistance can be monitored by fault diagnosis approaches based on voltage char- acteristics.58 For the control of other cases of thermal abuse, we may return to the situation of TR control shown in Figure 3. Overall, TR mitigation encompasses many issues, and here, a closed loop is formed. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK To the best of our knowledge, we have presented an updated overview of TR miti- gation strategies for LIBs. Opportunities exist for researchers and engineers to solve the safety problems associated with high-energy LIBs for their last mile before appli- cations. The mitigation strategies can work at the material level, cell level, and sys- tem level, guaranteeing the overall safety of an electric energy storage system that uses LIBs. The mitigation strategies can be chemical, mechanical, electrical, or ther- mal, as long as they carry out any of the following failure mitigation steps: (1) reduce the possibility of abuse conditions, (2) eliminate the abuse conditions once they occur, (3) enhance the thermal stability of battery cell against abuse conditions, (4) diminish the energy released under a TR case, (5) identify potential TR and warn at the earliest stage, and (6) mitigate the propagation hazard and restrict the damage in a limited area. Based on this, everyone can contribute to enhancing the safety of LIBs with their unique techniques. We encourage the following research directions that may help the TR mitigation in the future: Reaction Regulation Guided by the Time Sequence Map We suggest that a researcher should have a clear understanding of the TSM of the TR mechanism, regardless of the kind of technique he or she is attempting to develop to improve the safety of LIBs. The TSM helps save time in developing solutions because 764 Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 the trial should be accurate to function at speciﬁc reaction routes. A database con- taining the failure properties of chemical reactions, including the thermodynamics,7 kinetics, reactants, and products, needs to be formed to solidify the usage of a TSM. Hopefully, a time will come when the TR mitigation techniques are developed quan- titively under the guidance of the TSM, although additional studies are required to develop such a new theory. Thermally Stable Components, Such as Cathode, Anode, Electrolyte, etc., to Enhance the Intrinsic Safety of LIBs Although we have almost exploited all the anode and cathode possibilities, we still have solid electrolytes to count on.51 Replacing the ﬂammable organic carbonate solvents with intrinsically nonﬂammable solid-state electrolytes (including polymer, oxide, and sulﬁde solid-state electrolytes) can be the ultimate solution to the safety issues associated with electrolytes. Besides the solid electrolyte, the development of safe solvents, additives, and lithium salts, such as a ﬂuorinated electrolyte, can help reduce the ﬂammability of the electrolyte. High-concentration electrolyte, or the ‘‘solvent-in-salt’’ electrolyte might also be beneﬁcial for improving the safety perfor- mance of lithium-ion cells.50 We recommend that further work focuses on the modi- ﬁcation of the electrolyte-electrode interface because the surface coating can adequately change the TR behavior.22 For the cathode, surface coating or changing the secondary particle from a polycrystalline morphology to a single-crystal morphology caninhibit thereactionatthe cathode-electrolyte surface by reducing the contact area. For the anode, the stability of the SEI layer is very important.65 Sur- face coating25 or artiﬁcial formation2 are promising strategies for stabilizing the SEI layer, thereby improving the thermal stability. However, we should note that newly developed material should bear comprehensive properties, such as durability, en- ergy and power density, and cost, not just safety. ‘‘Smart Batteries’’ with Smart Materials and Design Smart batteries contain components that can operate autonomously under speciﬁc cases.66 Smart materials for battery safety design rely on mechanisms that can release negative response toward faults. As TR is accompanied by temperature rise, thermal-responsive materials are favored as smart materials for increasing the electric resistance,67 blocking the ionic transport,21 and releasing a poisoning re- agent that can suppress TR29 at speciﬁc temperatures. Positive temperature coefﬁ- cient (PTC) materials are a special kind of thermal-responsive material. PTC materials can be applied by mixing them with the electrode or by coating on the surface of the electrode. Organics with relatively high functional temperatures (\u0004100\u0003C) can also function as thermal-responsive materials. Thermal-responsive polymers can be used to block ionic transport under a TR case,68 whereas embedded microspheres can melt and cover the electrode to block ion transport.69 A poisoning reagent that can neutralize the reactivity between cathode and anode might be helpful in di- minishing the heat released during TR, although the poisons must be released under failure conditions rather than normal conditions. Thus, a core-shell structure29 might be essential for the smart release of poisons under a TR case. For the design of poi- sons, one should consider how the poison functions in relation to the TSM. It is important to know whether the poison suppresses internal short circuit, chemical re- actions, or combustion. The suppression of Li plating is accomplished by self-healing separators.66 Silica nanoparticles embedded in separators can react with the penetrating lithium den- drites, thereby retarding the growth of the lithium dendrite.70 A sandwich structure is also beneﬁcial for the early detection of an internal short circuit that is induced by Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 765 dendrite growth.64 Moreover, embedded temperature, voltage, or force sensors are beneﬁcial not only for monitoring the internal states but also for providing immedi- ate information for mitigation operations. For instance, the reference electrode can facilitate the online detection of the anode potential to monitor lithium plating. Fast charging without lithium plating for LIBs can be achieved through online measure- ment of the anode potential using a reference electrode.53 Safety Monitoring by Intelligent Battery Management System We recommend the next-generation BMS to have upgraded sensors, models, and data-processing methods. For the upgraded sensor, we recommend sensors or chips that can be embedded inside the cell for immediate fault diagnosis. As was mentioned in the paragraph above, the functional separator and reference elec- trode are two promising candidates that address this issue. The working direction is to improve the adaptability of the embedded sensor with the electrochemical sys- tem inside the cell and to extend the service time of the embedded sensor. For the upgraded model, pioneering researchers are constructing mechanistic models, with many internal states that are observable under the control theory, into next-gener- ation BMSs.71 Predictably, the future BMS will be more intelligent in monitoring the internal status (including fault information) of LIBs, aided by embedded sensors and reduced-order models. For the upgraded data-processing methods, artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms can process big data to predict possible safety events. Nowadays, massive data are re- corded during the daily operation of electric vehicles and uploaded to a cloud moni- toring system. Considering the challenge of disposing large amounts of data, data- driven methods using machine learning may help build models to process the data using cloud computing technology.72 A successful practice has been demonstrated in Severson et al.,73 which uses machine learning tools to predict the battery cycle life before capacity degradation occurs. In further studies, we encourage the use of data-driven methods that can predict on-board faults based on the recorded data that are uploaded to the cloud. Remote diagnosis, early warning and active mitigation of TR rely on the accurate data-driven prediction on the cloud. This early identiﬁcation and notiﬁcation can prevent potential accidents at the earliest stage, signiﬁcantly reducing the possibility of ﬁeld failure. Model-Based Safety Design of Battery Systems Conventionally, safety tests are expensive and have limited repeatability. Simulation tools are urgently required to reduce the cost of safety tests, particularly for the safety design at the system level. A reliable model can generate a safety envelope virtually, setting a safety boundary for battery systems.74 TR models are currently used to guide the safety design of LIBs at both the cell9 and system levels.39 The research direction for the TR models include (1) improving the model accuracy and (2) reducing the computational load. The accuracy of the TR model can be improved by establishing amendment dynamics upon chemical reactions, e.g., simulating the venting process and the combustion process. The accurate calibra- tion of the parameters is also essential and requires considerable attention. Optimally, the safety design should create a balance between the performance and safety, simultaneously. Model-based optimizations are essential for addressing this issue. Any feature that we want to optimize must be simulated simultaneously with the safety issues, by mathematical equations. These kinds of models are called ‘‘multi-physic and multi-scale’’ models,75 and the equations that link multi-physics are called ‘‘coupling equations.’’ Several challenges still hinder the utilization of 766 Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 multi-scale-multi-physic models. First, the quantitative relationship between the safety behaviors at the material and cell levels is still unclear. We still do not know how the electrode modiﬁcation inﬂuences the TR behavior of the lithium-ion cell. Second, the coupling mechanisms of the mechanical, electrical, and thermal abuse conditions still require further study. Third, the question on how to balance the ac- curacy and computational efﬁciency remains unanswered. Heat Dredging in Thermal Management Systems Effective heat dredging strategies should be considered in the safety design of bat- tery thermal management systems, particularly for preventing the TR propagation. The heat ﬂow should be dredged via reasonable pathways. The challenge is that the energy release is intensive (>10 kW at peak for high-energy cells), forming huge thermal gradient between the triggering point and the neighboring cells. First, heat blocking is essential in delaying the triggering of TR in adjacent cells by fast heat conduction.35 Second, the heat should not be allowed to accumulate within the failure point; therefore, rapid heat dissipation or cooling mechanisms are recom- mended for lowering the temperature of the TR cell. The thermal barriers must have low thermal conductivity and a high working temperature. However, there is a contradiction between the thermal insulation under the TR condition and heat dissi- pation under the normal condition. We propose that a smart thermal-responsive ma- terial be employed to cope with this dilemma if a high thermal conductivity is observed under normal condition and low thermal conductivity under the TR condi- tion. Phase change materials might beneﬁt the prevention of TR propagation by heat absorption76; phase change materials with large latent heat and good thermal con- ductivity should be further developed. The development of a composite structure that can contain the phase change material and skeletons that can withstand extreme temperature is encouraged to prevent TR propagation. The battery thermal management system can actively respond a TR triggering event, if it can reinforce the cooling coefﬁcient under extreme conditions. Flooding the failure region with a coolant might be a promising strategy, if one does not want an extra ﬁre-extin- guishing system on board. We strongly suggest that there should be little ﬁre during the TR propagation process. Since ﬁre makes the situation hopeless, we need to pay more attention to eliminating the possibility of ignition. Generally, to allow sufﬁcient time for rescuing trapped passengers in an accident, the battery thermal manage- ment system should be able to delay the TR propagation for at least 40 min (including the time for the brigade to arrive on-site and for the trapped passengers to be evacuated). An obvious trade-off exists between the safety design cost and the delay of TR propagation. Simulation tools are uniquely beneﬁcial for balancing the safety design cost and the prevention of TR propagation. Proper Test Method to Evaluate Safety Performance Safety tests should be designed to reproduce abuse conditions experienced by the cell, module, and system in practical situations. Although several testing standards and regulations for LIBs exist, some problems remain unsolved and require further investigation. At the cell level, reliable test methods for simulating the latent- induced internal short circuit requires further study.43,45 At the pack level, the global committee of EVS-GTR and ISO are working together to ﬁnd solutions to prevent the TR propagation on-board.77,78 As the capability of existing cells is increasingly and harshly exploited, we should pay more attention to the ‘‘electrochemical abuse’’ that lies underneath the mechanical, electrical, and thermal abuses. Designing visionary standards that can predict failure cases in the future requires a conscious awareness of the safe working window for all Joule 4, 743–770, April 15, 2020 767 kinds of LIBs. For the emerging new chemistries, e.g., lithium metal cells, silicon- based cells etc., current test procedures must be adapted to evaluate their overall safety. Furthermore, we should remember that if one wants to ascertain the safety of a newly developed cell system, he or she must provide comprehensive test re- ports for all kinds of abuses, as a single abuse test may not reﬂect the worst-case sce- narios for the newly developed sample. Moreover, we encourage researchers to establish reasonable test methods for eval- uating the safety of lithium-ion cells. Unsolved problems include the following: (1) identiﬁcation of TR, not by naked eye observation but with measurement signals, (2) repeatability of the TR triggering process, (3) elucidating the rationale behind for penetration and overcharge tests, (4) equivalency of the TR result by different triggering methods, and (5) evaluation of the safety of aged cells, etc. Finally, in Summary and Outlook, we remind researchers to pay attention to the safety performance when developing new chemistries. High energy density, fast charging and discharging, and excellent longevity are the top priorities in devel- oping new cell chemistries; however, the safety problem hides behind the ‘‘priority three’’ and hinders the utilization of ‘‘better’’ materials. Hopefully, our efforts can help mitigate the TR of LIBs more easily, increase the safety and availability of former unsafe cells, and suppress failure propagation under extreme conditions. We expect that researchers would collaborate to guarantee the overall safety of LIB systems in the near future.
