As a result, it has become more important than ever to have an accurate short-term forecast of electricity prices to support risk management and decision-making. Day-ahead forecasts of electricity prices are crucial for the short-term transactions that take place in the day-ahead, intraday or balancing markets and play a central role in the day-to-day operations of the market (Mayer and Tr¨uck, 2018; Kath and Ziel, 2018). They not only allow the adjustment of long-term positions, but also provide a reference point for OTC trading and settlement. Considering that electricity price forecasting is a very practical problem, the real value of the forecast should be evaluated with its economic value. The primary goal of a forecast is to support the decision-making process and to reduce the risk associated with this process. That is why, for a long time, some researchers have expressed negative views on the exclusive use of statistical measures of the error to evaluate and compare forecasts (Maciejowska et al., 2022). Over the past decade, only few authors have attempted to quantify the economic beneﬁts of price forecasting (e.g., Zareipour et al., 2010; Hong, 2015; Magalh˜aes et al., 2023), and a standardized methodology for evaluating it has not yet been established (Hong et al., 2020). What is more, all of them have been limited to point forecasts. Recently, a diﬀerent approach was presented by Uniejewski and Weron (2021), who introduced a trading strategy that utilizes probabilistic predic- tions to compare the performance of probabilistic forecasting models. The proposed solution has some serious limitations as it requires trading on the balancing market, which is associated with high risk. In this paper, another trading strategy is proposed that can be applied to day-ahead markets and allows market participants to make proﬁts. The strategy requires access to an energy storage system, which has become more prevalent due to the growth of production from renewable energy sources (Meade and Islam, 2015; Gianfreda et al., 2020). Optimal storage system performance is becoming increasingly important in light of the decarbonization goals set by European countries. According to Wesseh and Lin (2021), energy storage can be crucial to decarbonizing the energy sector, as it can play an important role in integrating variable renewable energy into power sys- tems. Proposed trading strategy is inspired by the Uniejewski and Weron (2021), but here each transaction is made in the day-ahead market without requiring participation in the balancing mar- ket.The general rule claims that more accurate forecasts can directly lead to better ﬁnancial results (Maciejowska et al., 2022). To improve the accuracy of the predictions, in this paper, a novel ap- proach to obtain probabilistic forecasts, called Smoothing Quantile Regression (SQR) Averaging is introduced. The approach is inspired by Fernandes et al. (2021) where the fundamentals of the smoothing quantile regression, as well as its statistical details, are described. In this article, the SQR method is used for the ﬁrst time to average predictions. The new approach is proposed in three variants, which can be considered as smoothed equivalents to Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) by Nowotarski and Weron (2015), Quantile Regression Machine (QRM) by Marcjasz et al. (2020) and a probability (F) average of Quantile Regression (QRF) by Uniejewski et al. (2019), and are denoted as SQRA, SQRM and SQRF, respectively. During the past decades, most EPF studies have focused only on point predictions. However, the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom2014) has ended the point forecasting 2 hegemony. Instead of focusing on point forecasts, organizers have advocated computing quan- tile predictions (Hong et al., 2016). The development of probabilistic forecasting methods in the EPF has been beyond necessary. Increased market penetration of renewable energy sources and active demand response, along with sudden changes in generation levels, unpredictable consumer behavior, and signiﬁcant deviations in temperature from mean levels, contribute to the increased probability of extreme values or price spikes (Huisman, 2008; Grossi and Nan, 2019). As a re- sult, the gap between production and consumption is widening and short-term electricity prices have become even more volatile (Gianfreda et al., 2018; Kowalska-Pyzalska, 2018). All this has driven the research in the direction of probabilistic price (Nowotarski and Weron, 2018) and load (Hong and Fan, 2016) forecasting. In comparison to point predictions, the probabilistic ones provide a full picture of the future price distribution. They allow for a better adjustment of the oﬀering process to avoid the costs in- duced by a range of unexpected generation or consumption volumes (Morales et al., 2014). Proba- bilistic EPF is a concept closely related to risk management. In general, good quality probabilistic price forecasts can help producers, retailers, and speculators to determine optimal strategies for short-term operations (Uniejewski and Weron, 2021), as well as derivative pricing, Value-at-Risk calculations, hedging, and trading (Bunn et al., 2016). Formally introduced by Nowotarski and Weron (2015), Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) sparked interest in the EPF community after its astonishing success in the GEFCom2014 com- petition. The variants of the method were then used by two winning teams in the price track (Gaillard et al., 2016; Maciejowska and Nowotarski, 2016). Despite more than successful perfor- mance in a dozen EPF papers, a recent study of Marcjasz et al. (2020) has revealed some important deﬁciencies of the method. Firstly, the quality of the forecasts decreases signiﬁcantly when the set of regressors is greater than just two or three. Secondly, the interval predictions obtained with QRA are too narrow, making the electricity price forecast less reliable (Maciejowska et al., 2016). To address the ﬁrst issue, Uniejewski and Weron (2021) proposed a novel approach by applying ℓ1 regularization to correctly select individual point forecasts for QRA. In fact, the proposed solution signiﬁcantly outperformed the standard approach in terms of pinball loss for the rich pool of point forecasts, but it did not fully solve the problem of too narrow prediction intervals. It is important to clarify the terminology used in this paper regarding quantile regression av- eraging. The term quantile regression averaging encompasses the general concept of combining quantile regression with forecast averaging techniques. However, it is also speciﬁcally used to refer to the quantile regression averaging model introduced by Nowotarski and Weron (2015). To avoid confusion, throughout the remainder of this paper, the general concept will be denoted as QR Averaging, while the speciﬁc model proposed by Nowotarski and Weron (2015) will be referred to as QRA. Similarly SQR Averaging refers to an idea of using the smoothing quantile regression technique to average forecasts, while SQRA refers to a speciﬁc model. This article introduce new class of models called smoothing quantile regression averaging and assesses its performance using datasets from four electricity markets and ﬁve distinct point fore- casts obtained through various data transformations. Empirical results demonstrate the superior predictive performance of the new method compared to well-established benchmarks in terms of Kupiec (1995) test, the pinball score as well as the conditional predictive accuracy test. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 oﬀers a brief description of the 3 datasets. Section 3 discusses the construction of point forecasts, introduces the idea of smooth- ing quantile regression, along with a description of the probabilistic forecasting benchmarks, and presents the trading strategy. In Section 4, the predictive performance of point forecasts is eval- uated, followed by the discussion of the coverage and sharpness of probabilistic forecasts. Ad- ditionally, a range of trading strategies is evaluated in terms of the proﬁts obtained with diﬀerent probabilistic predictions. Finally, in Section 5, the results are summarized and the conclusions are drawn. 2. Datasets This empirical study has utilized datasets from four distinct markets, spanning eight years each. The ﬁrst one, German EPEX spot market, has recently experienced a great increase in the share of renewable generation and some major structural changes, which makes it very interesting for anal- ysis. Data was collected from the transparency platform (https://transparency.entsoe.eu) and comprise two time series, each at an hourly resolution (see Figure 1a): • day-ahead electricity prices for the DE-AT-LU bid zone until 30.9.2018 and DE-LU after- wards, • day-ahead total load forecasts for Germany. The second dataset represents another major European power market. The data comes from the Scandinavian Nord Pool (NP) exchange. The main feature that distinguishes the market is its high dependence on renewable sources such as hydro and wind, which for some days cover the entire demand. Data is taken from the oﬃcial Nord Pool website (https://www.nordpoolgroup.com)) and the transparency platform (load forecasts) and, like the previous set, consists of two time series at an hourly resolution (see Figure 1b): • day-ahead system prices for the entire Nordic region, • day-ahead load forecasts (consumption prognosis) for Norway. The third European market included in the research is the Spanish OMIE market. The Iberian market, unlike other European markets, still does not allow the price to drop below zero. This feature, along with the rapid development of the market, makes it very interesting to analyze. Data was collected from the transparency platform and comprise two time series at an hourly resolution (see Figure 1c): • day-ahead marginal electricity prices for Spain, • day-ahead total load forecasts for Spain. The last dataset represents the American PJM market. PJM was the world’s largest electricity market until the development of the European Integrated Energy Market in the 2000s. The data is taken from the PJM data miner (https://dataminer2.pjm.com) and includes two time series at an hourly resolution (see Figure 1d): • day-ahead marginal electricity prices for the COMED zone, 4 0 200 400 600 800Day-ahead Price [EUR] Initial calibration window for point forecasts Test period for point forecasts Test period for probabilistic forecasts Initial calibration window for probabilistic forecasts 1.1.2015 1.1.2016 29.12.2016 1.1.2018 1.1.2019 1.1.2020 1.1.2021 1.1.2022 31.12.2022 40 60 80Load forecast[GWh] (a) EPEX system prices (top), day-ahead load prognosis (bottom) 0 200 400 600 800Day-ahead Price [EUR] Initial calibration window for point forecasts Test period for point forecasts Test period for probabilistic forecasts Initial calibration window for probabilistic forecasts 1.1.2015 1.1.2016 29.12.2016 1.1.2018 1.1.2019 1.1.2020 1.1.2021 1.1.2022 31.12.2022 10 20 30Load forecast[GWh] (b) Nord Pool system prices (top), day-ahead load prognosis (bottom) 0 200 400 600 800Day-ahead Price [EUR] Initial calibration window for point forecasts Test period for point forecasts Test period for probabilistic forecasts Initial calibration window for probabilistic forecasts 1.1.2015 1.1.2016 29.12.2016 1.1.2018 1.1.2019 1.1.2020 1.1.2021 1.1.2022 31.12.2022 20 30 40Load forecast[GWh] (c) OMIE system prices (top), day-ahead load prognosis (bottom) Figure 1: Day-ahead prices and day-ahead load forecast time series from 1.1.2015 to 31.12.2022.

All time series span 2922 days, ranging from 1.1.2015 to 31.12.2022. The missing or doubled values (corresponding to the time change) were replaced by the average of the closest observations for the missing hours and the arithmetic mean of the two values for doubled hours. Four datasets from major energy markets were chosen to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method and its ability to ﬁt into various time series. The price series structure of all, but especially the three European markets, showed signiﬁcant changes over the eight-year period considered, as shown in Figure 1. The beginning of 2020 and the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, brought about signiﬁcant changes in the dynamics of electricity prices. The price volatility increased signiﬁcantly in the years 2020- 2022 due to COVID-19 and unstable political situations in Eastern Europe. To enable a better analysis of the performance of the proposed forecasting models the prediction accuracy was tested on two sub-periods lasting respectively till the end of 2019 and from the beginning of 2020. 3. Methodology The price forecasting task is implemented separately for each hour, leading to 24 diﬀerent sets of parameters for every forecasted day. This multivariate framework is the most common approach in the EPF literature (see Ziel and Weron (2018) for a discussion of the uni- and multivariate frameworks). Although the 24 individual models are independent, they are estimated using the same set of information. The day-ahead price forecasts for day d are computed before the price auction (i.e., around noon of day d − 1). It means that at the time the predictions are made, the day-ahead load forecasts are already available (from around 9 AM) and the prices for all hours of day d − 1 are established (around 1 PM of day d − 2). 6 Point forecasts are determined with a rolling calibration window scheme, using data from the most recent 728 days (approximately 2 years). At ﬁrst, the models described in the following Sec- tion 3.1 are calibrated to data from 1.1.2015 to 28.12.2016 and forecasts for all 24 hours of 29th December are determined. Then the window is moved forward by one day (meaning 1.1.2015 is removed and 29.12.2016 is added), and the forecasts for all 24 hours of 30th December are com- puted. This procedure is repeated until the predictions for the last day in the dataset (31.12.2022) are made, giving a total number of 2194 forecasted days. Once the point forecasts are obtained, they are used as a basis to construct probabilistic pre- dictions. All the approaches considered (see Section 3.2) require a subsample of point prediction. Therefore, a rolling calibration window of 182 days (26 weeks) is used to estimate the quantiles of the future price distribution. As a result, probabilistic forecasts are obtained and then evaluated over the 2012-day period, from 29.6.2017 to 31.12.2022 (see Figure 1). The remainder of this section describes the forecasting scheme composed of two stages is described. Firstly, Section 3.1 introduces the point forecasting models. Secondly, Section 3.2, presents probabilistic forecasting benchmarks and introduces the smoothing quantile regression averaging models. Finally, Section 3.3, proposes and describes a probabilistic forecast-based trad- ing strategy. 3.1. Point forecasts For each day in the out-of-sample test period for point forecasts, i.e., d = 1, 2, ..., 2012, each hour of the day, i.e., h = 1, 2, ..., 24, and each of the considered Variance Stabilizing Transforma- tion (VST), the same multi-step procedure is followed: Pd,h standardize −−−−−−−→ pd,h VST −−−→ Yd,h predict −−−−→ ˆYd,h inverse VST −−−−−−−−→ ˆpd,h. inverse standardization −−−−−−−−−−−−−−−→ ˆPd,h. (1) First, prices are standardized in the 728-days-long calibration window. Next, one of the trans- formation functions described in the following section (see Section 3.1.1) is applied. Then the parameters of the expert model (see Eq. (2)) are estimated using ordinary least squares and day- ahead point predictions are computed. Finally, the inverse of the transformation used in the second step and the inverse of standardization are applied to obtain the ﬁnal price forecasts. The same standardization and VST are also applied to the load forecast series before ﬁtting the expert model in the prediction step. As a result of this routine, for each day d and hour h, ﬁve various point forecasts of the same expert model (see Section 3.1.2) estimated with diﬀerent VST are obtained. 3.1.1. Variance Stabilizing Transformations The spiky behavior of the electricity prices makes the model estimation hampered by extreme values. The outliers pull the model coeﬃcients towards values that ﬁt better to the spikes and increase the in-sample errors for the non-spiky periods. The general idea of the variance stabilizing transformation is to reduce the variation in the data (Uniejewski et al., 2018). A lower variation or less spiky behavior of the input data usually allows the forecasting model to produce more accurate predictions (Janczura et al., 2013) Following Uniejewski et al. (2018), before applying a proper VST, each time series (prices and load) is ﬁrst standardized by subtracting the sample median and dividing by the mean absolute 7 deviation (MAD) of the sample. Finally, the transformation is applied and the transformed price is denoted by Yd,h, i.e., Yd,h = f (pd,h), where f (·) is a given VST. After computing the forecasts, the inverse transformation and standardization are applied to obtain the ﬁnal electricity price forecasts: ˆPd,h = b f −1( ˆYd,h) + a. In this study, motivated by the results of Uniejewski et al. (2018), ﬁve VST classes have been used that performed best in the EPF context: Area hyperbolic sine (asinh), Box-Cox (boxcox), Mir- ror log (mlog), Polynomial (poly), Normal-distribution Probability Integral Transform (N-PIT). A detailed description of each transformation can be found in the original paper (Uniejewski et al., 2018). 3.1.2. The expert model The choice of the point forecasting model is motivated by two factors. Firstly, recent studies on the variable selection (Ziel and Weron, 2018; Uniejewski et al., 2016) allow to build a well- designed structure and motivate the choice of model regressors. Secondly, due to the computa- tional complexity required to produce probabilistic forecasts within a rolling calibration window scheme, the computational burden needed to obtain point forecasts has to be limited. Therefore, the sophisticated techniques, such as CNN (Amjady and Daraeepour, 2009) or RNN-based models (Kaya et al., 2023) are replaced with a parsimonious autoregressive structure. The model for the transformed price on day d and hour h was inspired by a number of EPF studies (Ziel and Weron, 2018; Uniejewski and Maciejowska, 2022) and is given by: Yd,h = β1Yd−1,h + β2Yd−2,h + β3Yd−7,h︸ ︷︷ ︸ autoregressive eﬀects + β4Yd−1,24︸ ︷︷ ︸ end-of-day + β5Y max d−1 + β6Y min d−1︸ ︷︷ ︸ non-linear eﬀects + β7Ld,h︸︷︷︸ load + ∑7 j=1 βh, j+7D j ︸ ︷︷ ︸ weekday dummies +εd,h, (2) where Yd−1,h, Yd−2,h and Yd−7,h account for the autoregressive terms and refer to the prices from the same hour of the previous day, two days before and a week before, respectively. Yd−1,24 is the midnight price of electricity for the previous day and is the last known price at the time the prediction is made. Y max d−1 and Y min d−1 represent the maximum and minimum prices of the previous day. Ld,h is the transformed day-ahead load forecast for a given hour of a day, ﬁnally D1, ..., D7 are weekday dummies and εd,h is the noise term assumed to be independent and identically distributed normal variables. Note that although recent studies indicate that using more exogenous variables such as wind and solar generation (Huisman and Stet, 2022), air temperature (Jasi´nski, 2020), or fossil fuels prices (Bill´e et al., 2023) can signiﬁcantly improve forecast accuracy, they are not included in the model due to missing observations or lack of availability. 3.2. Probabilistic forecasts The most common way to go from point to probabilistic forecasts is to construct quantile forecasts or prediction intervals (PIs). Instead of forecasting the expected value of the future price, we predict the price range in which the future price will fall with a given probability (α). If we continue with this idea and extend it to construct multiple PIs, the ﬁnal outcome will be a set 8 of quantiles of many diﬀerent levels. In this research, the objective is to forecast 99 percentiles (q = 1%, 2%, ..., 99%), which is a reasonably accurate approximation of a full distribution. In the econometric literature, there are many diﬀerent methods that can be used to obtain a quantile forecast, with the easiest and probably the most common method being the so-called his- torical simulation. However, in the case of electricity price forecasting, the QRA model plays a crucial role and can be treated as a gold standard in probabilistic EPF. In this paper, historical sim- ulation and QRA are used as benchmarks, and a novel approach to construct prediction intervals with smoothing quantile regression is proposed. 3.2.1. Historical simulation (HS) The most popular method for obtaining a quantile forecast takes into account both the point forecast and the corresponding error (Maciejowska et al., 2016). The center of the prediction in- terval (PI) is set at ˆPd,h (point forecast), while its limits are deﬁned by the quantiles of the forecast error distribution εd,h (Nowotarski and Weron, 2018). In this research, the historical simulation method utilizes the average of ﬁve point forecasts (each corresponding to diﬀerent VSTs) to con- struct probabilistic predictions. 3.2.2. Quantile Regression (QR) Averaging Quantile Regression Averaging was introduced by Nowotarski and Weron (2015) and was widely acknowledged in the literature on electricity price forecasting. QR Averaging is a special case of Quantile Regression (QR) of Koenker (2005) where the independent variables (regres- sors) are point forecasts of the dependent variable, i.e., ˆP(i) d,h for i = 1, ..., n. To obtain parameter estimates, the sum of the so-called check functions is minimized (Koenker, 2005): ˆβq = argmin βq { ∑ d,h ( q −1Pd,h<Xd,hβq) (Pd,h − Xd,hβq) ︸ ︷︷ ︸ check function } . (3) 3.2.3. Smoothing Quantile Regression (SQR) Averaging In this paper, a completely new approach to obtaining probabilistic electricity price forecasts is proposed. The method is based on the very fresh idea presented by Fernandes et al. (2021). The authors suggest modifying the function minimized in quantile regression (see Eq. (3)) by smoothing the objective function using kernel estimation. They showed that not only does the proposed solution yield a lower mean squared error compared to the standard QR estimator, but it is also asymptotically diﬀerentiable. In addition, the asymptotic theory holds uniformly with respect to the quantile level and bandwidth. In the proposed approach, the smoothing quantile regression of Fernandes et al. (2021) is used to average a pool of point forecasts. Therefore, the only (but crucial) change compared to the QRA model is the estimator of βq that takes the following form (Fernandes et al., 2021): ˆβq = argmin βq { ∑ d,h H × φ ( Pd,h−Xd,hβq of the standard normal distribution, respectively, while H is a bandwidth. The method is proposed in three diﬀerent variants, denoted by SQRA, SQRM, and SQRF (for details, see Section 3.2.5). The literature reviews and analyses of smoothing procedure integrated with quantile regres- sion can be found in Fernandes et al. (2021). However, to better illustrate the diﬀerence between smoothing and standard QR, the objective functions for diﬀerent quantile levels are plotted in Fig- ure 2. It can be observed that for any quantile (except median q = 50%) the minimum of the SQR objective function does not lie on the Y-axis. As a consequence, to forecast one of the lower quantiles, the favorable situation is when the prediction is smaller than the actual price. On the contrary, the lowest value of the objective function for the upper quantiles is shifted to the left from the Y-axis. This means that the SQR expects the upper quantile to be above the actual price and gives a higher penalty if the prediction of the upper quantile hits the actual price, which is the perfect scenario for the standard QR. The size of the shift, as well as the slope of the objec- tive function, depends on the bandwidth H. Note that the SQR is, in fact, a generalization of the standard QR. The limit of the objective function of SQR, when H tends to 0, is equivalent to the standard quantile regression. When comparing the prediction intervals (PIs) obtained with the QR and SQR estimators, the latter are usually signiﬁcantly wider. Recall that probabilistic forecasts of electricity prices most often suﬀer from too narrow PIs, that is why the SQR solution seems to ﬁt perfectly to the electricity data. 3.2.4. Bandwidth selection As in many applications of kernel estimation, the performance of the smoothing quantile re- gression strongly depends on the bandwidth choice. Following the recommendation of Fernandes et al. (2021) a simple approach was used to select an optimal bandwidth. The bandwidth value is com- puted according to the Rule-of-Thumb (RoT) method by Scott (1992): H = 1.06 σε probabilistic forecasts, and proposed to use the QRA model in several variants that outperform the original model. Based on that, in this research, three variants of QR and SQR-based methods are considered (see also Figure 3): • The standard approach is to apply one of the described methods to all available point fore- casts (with the intercept). This solution is denoted by QRA and SQRA consecutively for QR- and SQR-based methods. • The second approach is to use single point forecasts to obtain a single probabilistic predic- tion. As a result, ﬁve various probabilistic forecasts are obtained, each based on a diﬀerent point forecast. Next, motivated by the results of Uniejewski et al. (2019), a probability (F) averaging of the probabilistic forecasts is computed (for details see Section 3.3.2 in the cited article). Described models are denoted by QRF for the quantile regression-based model and, by analogy, SQRF for the smoothing quantile regression equivalent. • Finally, according to Marcjasz et al. (2020), in some applications it may be beneﬁcial to ﬁrst average point forecasts and then construct a probabilistic forecast based on the single prediction of a better accuracy. In such models, denoted by QRM or SQRM (respectively, for quantile regression and smoothing quantile regression), all available point forecasts are ﬁrst combined with arithmetic mean and the averaged prediction (with the intercept) is used as the input for a QR or SQR. To better understand the diﬀerence between the described variants, a graph that compares the models is presented in Figure 3. Finally, note that the forecasts for all 99 percentiles are computed separately. In such a setup, it is possible to obtain a nonmonotonic quantile function. Therefore, after obtaining the predictions of the 99 percentiles, the results are sorted independently for each day and hour. 3.3.

(Hong et al., 2020; Maciejowska et al., 2022) with only a few articles considering the economic value of the forecasts. Among them, we can distinguish two basic approaches: the ﬁrst takes into account a one-sided (supply or demand) perspective (Maciejowska et al., 2021; Janczura and W´ojcik, 2022), and the second evaluates the quality of the forecasts based on the trading strategy (Magalh˜aes et al., 2023). In this paper, following the latter approach, a trading strategy for the day-ahead market is proposed. It utilizes probabilistic forecasts to support the decision-making process. The strategy is suitable for a company with an access to an energy storage system, such as the virtual power plant. Let us assume that the company owns a 2.5 MWh battery. For both economic and technical reasons, it cannot be discharged below 0.5 MWh (20% of the nominal capacity), and its eﬃciency is 90% for each charge and discharge process. The company aims to buy energy and charge the battery when the price is low and to discharge and sell energy at high prices. In order to trade only on the day-ahead market, the company limits the volume of a single transaction (charge or discharge) to 1 MWh. The proposed strategy aims to leave 1 MWh of energy in the energy storage system at the end of each day. However, depending on whether the submitted bid or oﬀer are accepted or rejected, three battery states are possible at the beginning of the next day: • Bd = 0 refers to the situation in which, at the beginning of day d, the lower technical limit is 12 reached and there is no more energy to be sold. On day d∗ when Bd∗ = 0 the company will additionally place a price-taker oﬀer to buy energy and charge the battery. • Bd = 1 refers to the desirable situation in which a day starts with a half-full storage. In that state, the battery can be both charged and discharged. On day d∗ when Bd∗ = 1, the battery owner follows the basic steps described in Section 3.3.1. • Bd = 2 refers to the situation in which the capacity limit is reached and there is no space left in the battery at the beginning of day d. On day d∗ when Bd∗ = 2, the company will make an additional unlimited oﬀer to discharge the battery and sell energy. 3.3.1. Quantile-based trading strategies The proposed quantile-based trading strategies consist of three steps that are performed each day. In Step (1), based on the median forecast ( ˆP50%), the trader selects two hours – one with the lowest price on a given day denoted by h1 and one with the highest price indicated by h2. However, if on day d∗ the battery is fully discharged (Bd∗ = 0), the additional unlimited bid is placed at hour h∗. In such a case, the trader has to ensure that the additional transaction will take place before hour h1. It requires selecting not only two hours, in which the minimum and the maximum prices are most likely to be observed, but also the third hour corresponding to the additional bid, which is no longer a trivial task. To address this issue, the linear optimization solver should be used to select the optimal (that is, the most proﬁtable) hours to place oﬀers. The maximized function will be equivalent to the following problem (fractions 0.9 and 1 P50% 1 P50% 2 max P90% 1 P10% 2 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 Hour of the day 20 30 40 50 60 70 80Price Day-ahead 80% PI Median Selected prices Figure 4: Illustration of the quantile-based trading strategies when bidding for 17.1.2019 for EPEX dataset, based on the 80% PIs available a day earlier.

The grey space depicts the 80% prediction interval and the dots at the PI limits represent the oﬀer ˆP10% d,h2 and bid ˆP90% d,h1 price (see step (2) in quantile- based trading strategies). – If Bd = 0, the trader additionally buys 1 – If Bd = 2, the trader additionally sells 0.9 MWh of energy at hour h∗, so the daily proﬁt increases and equals 0.9Pd,h2 +0.9Pd,h∗ while the battery state is reduced (Bd+1 = Bd−2). • By analogy, if only the bid is accepted, at hour h1 the company buys 1 comparisons of forecasting accuracy among models during this exceptional period, the following time intervals were selected: • The period between 29.12.2016 and 31.12.2019 (denoted by 2017-2019), which was ana- lyzed for point forecasts related to the time before COVID-19. • The period between 29.6.2017 and 31.12.2019 (denoted by 2017Q3-2019), which was ana- lyzed for probabilistic forecasts relating to the time before COVID-19. • The period between 1.1.2020 and 31.1.2022 (denoted by 2020-2022), which was analyzed for both point and probabilistic forecasts during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. • The period between 29.12.2016 and 31.12.2022 (denoted by 2017-2022), which was ana- lyzed for point forecasts related to the entire out-of-sample period. • The period between 29.6.2017 and 31.12.2022 (denoted by 2017Q3-2022), which was ana- lyzed for probabilistic forecasts related to the entire out-of-sample period. 4.1. Point forecasts In this paper, the point forecast will be evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which is the most commonly used measures to test the accuracy of point forecasts (Weron, 2014): MAE = 1 Table 1: Mean absolute errors (MAE) of point forecast in four markets and ﬁve variance stabilizing transformations (in rows). Results are divided into three sub-tables, for three test periods: 2017-2019 (29.12.2016-31.12.2019), 2020- 2022 (1.1.2020-31.12.2022), and 2017-2022 (29.12.2016-31.12.2022). The lowest error in each column is marked in bold. MAE Table 2: The prediction interval coverage probability (PICP) for α = 50%, 70%, and 90% (consecutively from left to right) and three test periods: 2017Q3-2019 (29.6.2017-31.12.2019; top panels), 2020-2022 (1.1.2020-31.12.2022; middle panels), and 2017Q3-2022 (29.6.2017-31.12.2022; bottom panels). The values that are within a range of 2.5% of the nominal coverage are marked with green color, while the ones that deviate beyond 5% from the nominal coverage are marked with red color. The value of PICP closest to nominal coverage is marked with bold separately in each period and market. PICP Table 3: The number of hours of the day (out of 24) for which the null hypothesis of the Kupiec test is not rejected at the 1% signiﬁcance levels for α = 50%, 70%, and 90% prediction intervals.

Kupiec • SQR Averaging-based approaches are the only models that provide reliable forecasts for the 50% PI in European markets. For the PJM market, most models pass the test for the majority of hours. • For 70% PI, the Kupiec test indicates that only SQRM and SQRF fulﬁll the coverage test criterion for the majority of hours for the European markets. In particular, SQRF outper- forms all other models for all markets from Europe. For PJM, most models, except for HS and QRA, pass the test for the majority of hours. • The vast majority of methods struggle to provide reliable forecasts even for a single hour for the 90% PI. Only the SQRF passes the test for a few hours in any of the European markets. The situation changes for PJM where SQRF and SQRM produce reliable predictions for the majority of hours. • SQRF provides the most reliable forecast on average, yielding the most reliable prediction intervals for 10 out of 12 cases. • QRA-based approaches and HS do not provide reliable forecasts for most of the prediction intervals considered, and QRA does not pass the Kupiec test for the majority of hours in any of the considered cases. In summary, it was found that SQR Averaging-based methods, particularly the SQRF model, provided the most reliable prediction intervals in most cases, except for the 50% and 70% PIs in the PJM market, which sometimes produced PIs wider than expected. Conversely, QR-based mod- els performed poorly compared to their SQR-based equivalents. The accuracy of the prediction intervals varied depending on the test period, with better results observed before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conﬂict. The PJM market, which experienced less disruption from these events, showed more reliable results. As a result, it can be concluded that the reliability condition is met for SQR Averaging-based methods and the sharpness of the forecasts can now be evaluated. 4.2.2. Sharpness measures The Pinball Score (PS) is used to compare the performance of the models and evaluate the sharpness of the forecasts in this study. The measure, which is a proper scoring rule (Gneiting and Katzfuss, 2014) widely used in EPF literature (for instance, Muniain and Ziel, 2020) and is equivalent to computing the quantile representation of the Continuous Rank Probability Score (CRPS; Laio and Tamea, 2007). The measure is deﬁned as follows: PS ( ˆPq d,h, Pd,h, q) =   (1 − q) ( ˆPq d,h − Pd,h) for Pd,h < ˆPq d,h, q (Pd,h − ˆPq d,h) for Pd,h ≥ ˆPq d,h, (11) where ˆPq d,h is the forecast of the price quantile of order q ∈ (0, 1) and Pd,h is the observed price for day d and hour h. 20 Table 4: The Aggregate Pinball Score (APS) for three test periods: 2017Q3-2019 (29.6.2017-31.12.2019), 2020-2022 (1.1.2020-31.12.2022), and 2017Q3-2022 (29.6.2017-31.12.2022). for four considered electricity markets. The best result is marked with bold independently for each market. APS Table 5: The Pinball Score aggregated across 10 extreme quantiles for three test periods: 2017Q3-2019 (29.6.2017- 31.12.2019), 2020-2022 (1.1.2020-31.12.2022), and 2017Q3-2022 (29.6.2017-31.12.2022) for four considered elec- tricity markets. The best result is marked with bold independently for each market. PS the NP market, the SQRF does not outperform QRA and SQRA, the Giacomini and White (2006) test suggests that SQRF is also not worse than those models. To sum up, the SQRF model consistently provided the most accurate probabilistic forecasts in terms of the pinball score for all markets and test periods. Pairwise comparisons showed that the kernel smoothing improves the performance of the quantile regression averaging procedure in all considered variants, particularly for extreme quantile. 4.3. Economic value No matter how accurate the forecasts are in terms of reliability or sharpness measures, their value is limited unless the accuracy gain can be translated into ﬁnancial proﬁts. In this section, the economic value of probabilistic forecasts is presented. The results of the trading strategies described in Section 3.3 are evaluated with ﬁnancial proﬁts. The reported measure indicates the average amount of money that the company can gain from a single 1MWh transaction. Therefore, the proﬁt is deﬁned as the total proﬁt obtained during the entire out-of-sample period divided by the sum of the total traded volume. Note that the reported proﬁts do not include transaction or investment costs. In Figure 6, the proﬁts (in EUR/MWh) obtained when using the benchmark and quantile-based strategies for all considered prediction intervals (50% to 98%) are reported. The plots illustrate the average score for the whole out-of-sample period (2017Q3-2022). Based on the results, diﬀerent forecasting models can be compared in terms of the economic value of the forecasts and some interesting conclusions can be drawn: • The proposed quantile-based trading strategy for the best-performing models using optimal PI level outperforms the unlimited bids strategy, with the improvement varying from 0.9% (for PJM) up to 14.3% (for OMIE), depending on the market. • The highest proﬁts for the proposed trading strategies, up to 21 EUR per 1MWh transaction, are yielded for EPEX market, while the lowest proﬁts are obtained for OMIE, with the best- performing model yielding proﬁts slightly above 8 EUR/MWh. • On average, the SQRF model generates the highest proﬁts, except for the EPEX market, where the QRF and SQRM slightly outperform other competitors. • The performance of the forecasting models changes across quantiles. Although SQRF dom- inates other methods for nearly all quantiles in the Nord Pool and OMIE markets, the results in the other two markets do not indicate a clear winner. • QRA and SQRA are the worst-performing forecasting models in terms of economic value for all markets. • The choice of optimal PI level in the quantile-based trading strategy varies across markets, with the highest proﬁt per transaction obtained using 50% PI for EPEX and 68%, 54%, and 60% PIs for Nord Pool, OMIE, and PJM, respectively. 23 50 60 70 80 90 98 Prediction Interval 18 18.5 19 19.5 20 20.5 21Relative profit per 1MW EPEX unlimited HS QRA QRM QRF SQRA SQRM SQRF 50 60 70 80 90 98 Prediction Interval 9 9.2 9.4 9.6 9.8 10 10.2 10.4Relative profit per 1MW NP 50 60 70 80 90 98 Prediction Interval 6.8 7 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8 8.2Relative profit per 1MW OMIE 50 60 70 80 90 98 Prediction Interval 9.6 9.7 9.8 9.9 10 10.1 10.2 10.3 10.4Relative profit per 1MW PJM Figure 6: The proﬁts per 1 MW traded for EPEX (upper left), NP (upper right), OMIE (lower left), and PJM (lower right) markets obtained using benchmark and quantile-based strategies at diﬀerent PI levels and all considered prob- abilistic forecasting models for the 2017Q3-2022 test period. The grey line refers to the proﬁts for HS method, the blue ones represent the class of QRA-based models and the red ones depict the proﬁts of the SQR Averaging-based class of method. The result of the unlimited bids strategy is plotted with solid black lines. It can be observed from the results presented in Figure 6 that the performance of the trading strategy is consistent with the performance of the probabilistic models based on their statistical measures. The top two models with the lowest pinball loss scores, SQRF and QRF, also perform the best in terms of average proﬁts. 5. Conclusions The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it introduces a new probabilistic forecasting technique called Smoothing Quantile Regression Averaging, which combines a well-performing load and price forecasting approach with kernel estimation to improve the reliability of the es- timates. This approach produces probabilistic forecasts that signiﬁcantly outperform a range of well-performing benchmarks. Second, the manuscript is one of the ﬁrst in the literature to bridge the gap between computing probabilistic forecasts and trading based on such forecasts. More speciﬁcally, it introduces a trading strategy using probabilistic price forecasts and battery storage 24 that can be eﬀectively implemented in a day-ahead electricity market. In this study, the forecasting methods were evaluated across four distinct datasets from the Ger- man, Nordic, Iberian, and American power markets. The proposed method is compared against several well-established benchmarks, including historical simulation and variants of Quantile Re- gression Averaging. The performance of probabilistic forecasting models was compared using the Kupiec test, the pinball score, and the conditional predictive accuracy test. The results of the empirical tests reveal that SQRM and SQRF, the variants of SQR Averaging outperform the comparison methods in terms of both reliability and sharpness. The robustness of the proposed method was further demonstrated by presenting results for two separate test periods, namely 2017-2019 (pre-COVID) and 2020-2022 associated with the COVID- 19 pandemic and the unstable political situation in Europe. Although the accuracy of the forecasts is clearly lower for the latter one, the overall conclusion remains the same for both periods. This highlights the remarkable consistency and robustness of the proposed methods to market changes, which is a highly desirable feature in electricity price forecasting and other applications. In addition, this study introduces a trading strategy that utilizes only day-ahead market prices and is suitable for companies with access to energy storage systems, such as virtual power plants. The proposed strategy provides evidence of the economic value of probabilistic forecasts, with the highest proﬁts obtained using the newly proposed SQRF model. Overall, the proposed SQR Averaging-based methods oﬀer signiﬁcant potential for improving forecast accuracy, thus enhancing risk management and supporting the decision-making process in electricity markets. The demonstrated reliability and robustness of the method suggest that it can be successfully applied to other markets and forecasting applications, which can be further investigated in future research. Future research should address the issue of bandwidth selection for the SQR Averaging method. In this paper, a simple rule-of-thumb method is used to select the bandwidth for the SQR estima- tor. However, there are many other methods for selecting the optimal bandwidth, such as maxi- mum likelihood cross-validation or the plug-in method. Despite the popularity of these alternative methods in the literature, their performance in this application remains an open research ques- tion. Therefore, further research is needed to determine the most appropriate bandwidth selection method for SQR-based models.
