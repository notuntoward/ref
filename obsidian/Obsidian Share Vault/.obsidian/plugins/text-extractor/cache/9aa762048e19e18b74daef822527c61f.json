Non-intrusive appliances load monitoring (NIALM) is a 8 methodology that aim to breakdown the total power consumption measured by the smart meter in each 9 household into the power consumed by the individual appliances. These detailed information on 10 individual appliances consumptions can influence the users to follow better energy usage profiles so as to 11 achieve energy savings. We introduce a novel energy disaggregation model that consider mutual devices 12 interactions and embed the information on devices interactions into the Factorial Hidden Markov Models 13 (FHMM) representations of the aggregated data. The hidden states in the FHMM were inferred by means 14 of the Viterbi algorithm. Devices interactions is a power quality issue that affects the measured power 15 consumed by a device when there are other devices connected to the network. We tested our model using 16 a selected house from the REDD public data set. Our proposed approach showed enhanced results when 17 compared with the standard FHMM. Devices interactions, when observed, enabled us to disaggregate and 18 assign energy consumption for individual devices more accurately. 19 Keywords: non-intrusive appliance load monitoring, energy disaggregation, devices interactions, 20 Factorial Hidden Markov Models, Viterbi algorithm. 21 1. INTRODUCTION 22 It is becoming an established fact that the world faces many challenges regarding energy matters 23 such as resources limitation, sustainability, carbon emissions, etc. Therefore, techniques for energy 24 savings and energy management are necessary to assist in resolving some of these issues. 25 In residential homes, energy smart meters give information about the total aggregated household 26 consumption of energy. This information is insufficient to inform inhabitants about consumption by 27 individual devices. It is believed that giving detailed information about the energy consumed by each 28 device will influence users on energy usage that would lead eventually to the decrease in energy 29 consumption [1]. Studies conducted had shown energy savings from 9% to 20% (see e.g. [1, 6] in this 30 aspect). Energy disaggregation, or non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM), is the task of 31 decomposing the aggregate consumption readings of a house smart meter into its individual devices 32 consumptions. 33 Formally, this problem can be defined as follows: Given the total power consumption 𝑝(𝑡) at any 34 time instant 𝑡, we have 35 𝑝(𝑡) = 𝑝1(𝑡) + 𝑝2(𝑡) + ⋯ + 𝑝𝑛(𝑡) (1) The problem is to estimate each 𝑝𝑗(𝑡), the individual power consumption of the device 𝑗 at time 36 instant 𝑡, where j=1, 2, … n, t=1, 2, … T and n is the total number of active devices within the time 37 period 𝑇 [2]. Applications of load disaggregation also include energy management systems and faults 38 troubleshooting [3]. 39 To simplify the task of load disaggregation, a load inside a house is considered to fall into one of 40 the following four categories [4]: 41 2 - Base load or always ON devices: these are loads which are operating at all time instants. These 1 devices do not switch to the OFF state and they usually have constant active and reactive power 2 draws. Smoke detector is a typical example for this category. 3 - ON/OFF devices: these are loads with only two possible states (operating/ not operating). 4 Examples of such devices include light bulb, television, toaster, etc. 5 - Finite State Machines (FSM): these are appliances with finite number of possible states. An 6 appliance in this category usually draws different amount of power at each state. Examples of this 7 category include stand and ceiling fans, washing machine, etc. 8 - Continuously variable devices: these are loads without fixed number of states and consumes 9 variable amount of power based on their usage manner. An example of this category is the light 10 dimmer. 11 It is important to notice that in the NIALM process, there is no need to install additional sensors to 12 report devices states because we deal directly with the total measurements from the main smart meter. In 13 intrusive load monitoring techniques, the installations of sensing devices made the energy disaggregation 14 process more costly, complex and less practical in applications [2]. 15 2. BACKGROUND 16 Non-intrusive load monitoring was first proposed by Hart in 1992 [5]. His study showed the 17 possibility to detect appliances operations by inspecting their signatures in the total consumption signal. 18 The main work of disaggregation consisted of two steps. Firstly, to measure significant features whenever 19 an event is detected (devices switch ON or OFF) as shown in Figure 1 [5]. Then, to cluster these features 20 (distinct signatures) into different clusters or groups that represent different appliances. It was observed 21 that high power consuming devices are easier to be classified since they are placed far from other devices 22 in the features space. Meanwhile, there are overlapping points in low power consuming devices, which 23 require additional decision criteria to assign them correctly into devices clusters. 24 Influenced by Hart’s work, researchers started to extend the work by investigating new 25 methodologies to enhance disaggregation accuracy. There is mainly two paths to improve the 26 disaggregation process: extracting new significant features and improving the clustering algorithms [4]. 27 28 Fig. 1. Total load showing step changes due to individual appliance events [5]. 29 3 2.1. Low and high frequency sampling features 1 The number and nature of features that can be extracted from the aggregated total signal obtained 2 from the smart energy meter depend essentially on the sampling frequency used in the measurement 3 stage. High frequencies sampling measurements, which usually use frequencies of several kHz, can 4 capture fine features such as harmonics, transient characteristics, voltage current V-I trajectory shapes, 5 electromagnetic interference (EMI) and noise Fast Fourier Transform (noise FFT) [2]. Although high 6 frequency measurements can provide more fine and detailed signatures, it is still not a practical solution 7 due to the need of installations for new equipment. Currently installed, or to be installed, smart meters 8 usually report power usages at low frequency intervals such as every 1 second interval. Therefore, the 9 solutions for the energy disaggregation problem based on low frequencies signatures are more practical 10 and promising. Main features that can be captured by low frequency measurements are generally 11 macroscopic ones like active and reactive power measured at transition instants of states [4]. Our 12 approach make the use of the measurements from the smart meters without the need of additional sensors 13 installations. 14 Some non-electric signal features can help in the disaggregation process. These are usually related 15 to users’ behavior or outside environmental factors such as ambient temperature, time of use, duration of 16 use, interdependency between appliances, etc. [6]. 17 2.2. Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms 18 In supervised learning algorithms, there is a training phase for the proposed models before it is set 19 to work. In this phase, a database of all possible devices along with their features are recorded. The 20 disaggregation process is done later either through optimization or pattern recognition approaches. In 21 optimization methods, the system tries different combinations of known devices that will result in 22 minimized error between actual and estimated total consumptions. In pattern recognition approaches, 23 different methodologies were used to classify devices into their relevant groups such as Bayesian 24 Classifiers, Neural Networks, Hidden Markov Model and its extensions [2]. Supervised learning 25 approaches require training for the models of each device, which make it less applicable in actual system 26 deployment since individual consumption patterns are unavailable in normal situations. Therefore, 27 research has been directed to unsupervised approaches to gain better scalable, time and cost effective 28 solutions [6]. 29 Unsupervised approaches perform models training phase online while the disaggregation process is 30 running such that whenever a new possible device is defined, it will be added to the database of devices. 31 This process is usually done by probabilistic analysis and classification methods [6, 7]. 32 Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and their extensions were used in many proposed disaggregation 33 models due to their good representations of devices. The hidden states chain in HMMs represents the 34 operation state/states of a device and the emission or observation sequences represent the measured total 35 power consumption [8]. 36 Kim et al. [6] tested different extensions of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for better 37 representations and disaggregation outcomes. These models were 38 - Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) in which there are several independent hidden state 39 chains evolving in parallel and the observation is a joint function of these chains [9]. 40 - Factorial Hidden Semi-Markov Model (FHSMM), in which states are explicitly assigned to 41 occupancy duration periods that could fit to exponential or gamma distributions. 42 - Conditional FHMM (CFHMM), in which states changes are constrained to fulfill some conditions 43 based on current state. 44 - Conditional FHSMM (CFHSMM) that combines both FHSMM and CFHMM models. 45 4 Kolter and Jaakola [7] expressed a new approximate inference method based on FHMM. They 1 utilized two complementary models, the additive and the difference FHMM. The additive FHMM 2 captures well the total aggregate output signal while the difference FHMM encodes the signal differences 3 between subsequent levels (when a device switches ON or OFF). 4 Parson [8] proposed an approach in which a one-time supervised learning process with already 5 labeled data set was used to create general probabilistic models of appliances. Thereafter, these general 6 models can be tuned to previously unseen households in an unsupervised manner. The tuning process 7 resulted in specific models of devices that were present in the testing households. 8 2.3. Public data sets for energy disaggregation research work 9 Recently, data sets were made available for the public to test and compare the different proposed 10 approaches. The largest and detailed public data set available is the Reference Energy Disaggregation 11 Data Set (REDD) [10]. REDD includes both low and high frequency measurements of six real houses for 12 an approximate period of two weeks. Consumptions of individual appliances are also provided for the 13 purpose of training (in supervised approaches) or for algorithms validation and accuracy calculations. 14 Although REDD satisfies most research needs, it is noted that the summation of individual consumptions 15 often is not equal to total consumption at the same time instant. This indicates unmeasured or hidden 16 devices. Moreover, the devices are not grouped to belong either to mains 1 or mains 2 phase circuits. This 17 requires additional manual work for grouping in order to perform validation more accurately. In this 18 paper, the REDD data set was used to build models and to test our approach. 19 2.4. Accuracy metrics 20 An important issue among the different proposed energy disaggregation techniques is that there is 21 no one agreed metric where the different approaches can be compared with. From the literature, there 22 were commonly five different metrics used to evaluate disaggregation accuracy and they are described 23 briefly as follows 24 2.4.1. Total energy correctly assigned to individual devices. This accuracy metric is defined as 25 𝐴𝑐𝑐 = 1 − ∑ ∑ |𝑦̂𝑡(𝑖) − 𝑦𝑡(𝑖)| 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑇 𝑡=1 2 ∑ 𝑦̅𝑡 𝑇 𝑡=1 (2) where 𝑦̅𝑡 refers to the observed total power consumption at time t, 𝑦𝑡(𝑖) is the true power consumed at 26 time t by device i, and 𝑦̂𝑡(𝑖) is the estimated power consumption at time t by device i and n is the total 27 number of active devices operating during the period T. The factor of 2 in the denominator comes 28 from the fact that the absolute value will “double count” errors [10, 11]. This metric is used in this 29 paper as it gives a better evaluation in terms of how close the estimated energy consumed by a device 30 is to its actual consumption. 31 2.4.2. Using Precision, Recall and F-measure of detected events (devices switchings) [7]. In this metric, 32 events detected and classified are categorized into four groups based on reality and algorithm 33 outcomes as shown in Table 1. 34 Table 1. Actual Vs. concluded events. 35 Test conclusion Real event occurred Real event did not occur Detected True Positive (TP) False Positive (FP) Not detected False Negative (FN) True Negative (TN) Precision is a measure that describe the relevance ratio of the detected elements (percentage of truly 36 detected events from all detected events) and it is given by 37 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃 (3) 5 Recall is a measure of how many of relevant elements (events occurred in reality) were detected and it 1 is given by 2 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁 (4) F-Measure is a measure that combines precision and recall as the harmonic mean. It is given by 3 𝐹 = 2 (𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 × 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙) (5) 2.4.3. Kim et al. [6] also used the previous metric in 2.4.2 but they have redefined the Precision and 4 Recall by subdividing the true positive (TP) group into accurate true positive (ATP) and inaccurate 5 true positive (ITP) as follows 6 𝑇𝑃 { 𝐴𝑇𝑃, 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 |𝑃̂ − 𝑃| 𝑃 ≤ 𝜌 𝐼𝑇𝑃, 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 |𝑃̂ − 𝑃| 𝑃 > 𝜌 (6) 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝐴𝑇𝑃 𝐴𝑇𝑃 + 𝐼𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃 (7) 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝐴𝑇𝑃 𝐴𝑇𝑃 + 𝐼𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁 (8) where, 𝑃̂ is the estimated power consumption and 𝑃 is the actual consumption. Usually, power 7 consumption fluctuate within 20% of the mean power, thus a 𝜌 threshold can be taken as 0.2 [6]. 8 2.4.4. Liang et al. [12] differentiated between detection and classification accuracy as follows: if 9 detected events include all true and false detections, then detection accuracy is the percentage number 10 of those classified correctly from detected events. Classification accuracy is the percentage of number 11 of those classified correctly from truly detected events. Overall accuracy is the percentage number of 12 those classified correctly to events that actually occurred [4, 12]. 13 2.4.5. Parson [8] used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to trade-off between true positive 14 rate (TPR), which is same as Recall defined in 2.4.2, and its complementary false positive rate (FPR). 15 16 3. ANALYSIS OF DEVICES INTERACTIONS 17 In residential houses, devices are often connected in parallel to the main feeder line. In the ideal 18 case of operation, a device should operate like an isolated entity such that its operation neither is affecting 19 other devices nor is affected by others. Unfortunately, the design of devices allowed the presence of 20 mutual interactions effects between devices and other components connected to the electricity network. 21 3.1. Interpretation of devices interactions from statistical perspective 22 We consider an experiment model where the output observations (responses) are directly driven by 23 a set of controllable factors and a set of non-controllable factors (such as noise) as shown in Figure 2. 24 6 1 Fig. 2. General experiment model. 2 In factorial design of an experiment, each factor (device) A and B can be either High (ON) or Low (OFF). 3 The response y is the output of the system that intuitively depends on the states of these factors. To detect 4 if an interaction AB exists between factors A and B, we firstly define the notations for different responses 5 y (measured power outputs) at different possible states of A and B as shown in Table 2. It is noted that 6 even when both factors A and B are OFF, we may still have a response i due to unknown factors or noise 7 effect. 8 Table 2. Response y at different A, B states. 9 Factor A state Factor B state y OFF OFF i ON OFF a OFF ON b ON ON ab In some experiments, the difference in response between the levels (Low/High) of one factor is not 10 the same when the other factors are at different levels. When this occurs, there is an interaction between 11 the factors [13, 14]. The main factors effects (A and B) and the two-way interaction effect (AB) can be 12 estimated from the average of differences between High and Low levels as follows 13 𝐴 = (𝑎𝑏 + 𝑎 − 𝑖 − 𝑏)/2 (9) 𝐵 = (𝑎𝑏 + 𝑏 − 𝑖 − 𝑎)/2 (10) 𝐴𝐵 = (𝑎𝑏 + 𝑖 − 𝑎 − 𝑏)/2 (11) As an illustration, suppose when all factors (devices) are OFF we have a response i of 20 W, a 14 response a (when A is ON alone) of 120 W, a response b (when B is ON alone) of 250 W and response ab 15 (when A and B are ON together) of 360 W. Therefore, main and interaction effects can be evaluated using 16 equations (9) to (11). Hence, we have the main effects A and B to be 105 W and 235 W respectively. The 17 two-way interaction AB can also be evaluated to be 5 W. 18 3.2. Sparsity of effects principle 19 In experiments with many factors, there could be higher orders (3 rd, 4th, etc.) interactions beside the 20 main factors effects. The sparsity of effects principle states that the system is usually dominated by the 21 main factors effects and low-order interactions (e.g. 2nd order interactions). The 3 rd and higher order 22 interactions are usually neglected [14]. In other words, higher order interactions such as three-factor 23 interactions are very rarely significant. This is sometimes referred to as the hierarchical ordering 24 principle. This property in factorial designs can be useful in the screening of significant factors from the 25 insignificant ones (see [13]). 26 7 In view of the above, in our proposed method on energy disaggregation, we only estimate the main 1 factors effects (main power consumption by devices) and the two-way interactions (where possible) 2 between two operating devices. These interactions were embedded into a FHMM as additional hidden 3 state chains. 4 3.3. Devices interaction as a power quality issue 5 Modern electricity networks are becoming more sophisticated due to, for example, the increased 6 use of power electronics devices. These devices introduce distortions in the power system due to their 7 nonlinear characteristics. Moreover, the electrical equipment have become more complex in terms of their 8 functionalities and the way in which they interact with other equipment connected to the same network 9 [15]. Generally, there is a possibility for two circuits to interact if they share a common point of 10 connection. Due to the electronic devices and low power quality in the operation of some devices, this 11 point of common connection allows the flow of different interference components such as harmonics and 12 electromagnetic interference currents. The design or manufacturing of a device is considered to have low 13 power quality issues when its operation does not satisfy the desired case. This includes emissions of 14 harmonics, interference currents, being affected by the operation of other devices, etc. 15 Gil-de-Castro et al. [16] studied harmonic interactions between different devices (LED lamp, 16 microwave oven and TV) and how different combinations of these devices could affect the charging 17 process of an electric vehicle (EV). It was found that the presence of a neighboring device could have a 18 strong influence on the harmonics emitted by the EV. In addition, the EV was found to be affected by 19 different emissions (amplitudes and frequencies) coming from different nearby devices. They concluded 20 that to understand the current flowing through an electronic device, the interactions between connected 21 devices must be understood. 22 Gil-de-Castro et al. [17] investigated harmonic emission of different domestic equipment combined 23 with different types of lighting. Their study showed that the total emissions produced by equipment 24 depended on the lamps that were connected in the background. 25 Pavas et al. [18] carried out a statistical analysis of power quality disturbances propagation by 26 means of the method of disturbances interactions. Their study was performed on a large scale to estimate 27 possible interactions between two buildings. The measurements were done at the medium/low voltage 28 level substation that feed the two buildings. The presence of disturbances was found to be responding to 29 possible interactions of the two buildings circuits and all connected devices. 30 In residential households, devices are usually connected in parallel as shown in Figure 3. To 31 investigate if two neighboring devices are interacting in terms of consumed power, the power 32 consumptions should be measured at different states of devices A and B. That is, measuring the power 33 consumptions when only one device is operating and when both are operating together. 34 35 Fig. 3. Parallel connection of devices in residential households. 36 8 In the ideal case, the devices should show zero interaction value i.e. power consumption when both 1 are operating is equal to the summation of the two individual consumptions. On the other hand, when 2 there is a difference between the two, it indicates that the devices have an amount of mutual interaction. 3 Thus, whenever 4 𝑝𝐴 + 𝑝𝐵 ≠ 𝑝𝐴𝐵 (12) where 𝑝𝐴 and 𝑝𝐵 are the power consumed when device A or device B is operating alone respectively and 5 𝑝𝐴𝐵 is the power consumed when both A and B are operating simultaneously. Then, the interaction effect 6 AB is not zero and could be estimated along with main factors effects using equations (9) to (11) as 7 explained earlier. It is noted that main factors effects must be always positive as devices always consumes 8 power. However, interactions can, theoretically, hold a positive or a negative value depending on the 9 behavior of devices under study. The interaction value is positive when we observe 𝑝𝐴𝐵 to be larger than 10 the summation of 𝑝𝐴 + 𝑝𝐵. On contrary, the interaction value is negative when we observe 𝑝𝐴𝐵 to be less 11 than the summation of 𝑝𝐴 + 𝑝𝐵. 12 4. PROPOSED MODEL FOR ENERGY DISAGGREGATION 13 We adopted a FHMM, with added chains for possible interactions, to represent the time series of 14 states and observations sequences as shown in Figure 4. 15 16 Fig. 4. FHMM with interactions chains. 17 The observations (X1 through XT) chain represent the observed total aggregate signal from the smart 18 meter measurements. The main factors (A, B, etc.) in hidden state chains represent a single state device or 19 a single state in Finite State Machine (FSM), since FSM can be encoded as a multi single-state device [6]. 20 The two-way interactions chains (e.g. AB, BC, etc.) represent the interaction between the corresponding 21 respective devices. An interaction AB is considered only when both main factors A and B are operating in 22 the ON state and so on for the other factors. The interaction AB holds the amount of change in power 23 consumptions when both A and B are ON than that when any operates alone. This happens due to 24 behavior change of a device consumption when other devices are present in the background. The 25 observed aggregate signal is ultimately the additive responses of all active factors effects and their 26 interactions at any time instant. Three-way and higher order interactions were neglected in accordance to 27 the principle of sparsity. 28 The infrastructure and properties of FHMM is well described in the literature (see e.g. [8, 19]). 29 Here, we focus on how the presence of interaction effects could enhance the energy disaggregation 30 process. The problem is to find the most probable sequence of hidden states that resulted in the given 31 sequence of observations. This problem can be solved by the Viterbi algorithm [19]. 32 9 4.1. Models of power consumptions by devices 1 Since the power consumed by a device is not constant during its operations in many cases, e.g. 2 refrigerators and heating devices, we have chosen to model the power consumed by a device (or a state of 3 a device) with three power levels: initial, average and final power consumption levels. Initial power level 4 is the level of power consumed directly when a device switches to ON state. We have used a period of 5 five seconds after a device is switched on to estimate the initial power consumption level. Conversely, the 6 final power is the power consumed five seconds before a device goes OFF. The average power level is the 7 mean power level during the entire period of operation. For example, Figure 5 shows a consumption 8 pattern of a refrigerator in house 2 from the REDD public data set [10]. It is clear that the power 9 consumed at the beginning of operation is larger than that before going into OFF state, and it keeps 10 decreasing during the operation period. Therefore, the proposed method gives a more accurate model of 11 assigning power consumptions to a device than that of assuming only one constant consumption level. A 12 contrary example is shown in Figure 6 for the consumption pattern of a central air conditioner [20]. It 13 shows that the power consumed by the central air conditioner starts at some value and then keep 14 increasing during operation. 15 16 Fig. 5. Consumption pattern by a refrigerator from REDD [10]. 17 18 Fig. 6. Consumption pattern by a central air conditioner [20]. 19 It is noticeable also that a device power consumption has natural fluctuations above/below the 20 mean value of the consumed power. Therefore, we have considered the devices consumptions as a 21 Normal distribution random variable to represent natural fluctuations as in [6]. The Normal distribution 22 for each device was considered with a mean value that is the same as the mean power level and a standard 23 deviation of 20% of the mean power level to represent the natural fluctuations. 24 4.2. Devices identification when a transition in total aggregate signal is detected 25 When a transition up is detected in the aggregate signal, the model will search for the most 26 probable device that has been switched ON by comparing the transition with the initial power of the 27 10 recorded devices in the database obtained in step 1 of the disaggregation algorithm in subsection 4.3. In 1 addition, the interaction effects between this possible device and currently operating devices are 2 considered. The new device will be detected by means of the Viterbi algorithm. Similar manner was used 3 to work with detected transitions down in the aggregate total signal. 4 That is, when a transition up is detected in aggregate signal, we search for a device x such that 5 𝑥∗~ arg min |(𝑋𝑖 + 2 ∙ ∑ 𝑋𝑌 𝑌 ) − |𝑡𝑥|| (13) Similarly, when a transition down is detected, we search for a device x such that 6 𝑥∗~ arg min |(𝑋𝑓 + 2 ∙ ∑ 𝑋𝑌 𝑌 ) − |𝑡𝑥|| (14) where, Xi is the main factor initial power level of the possible device x, Xf is the main factor final power 7 level of the possible device x, Y is all currently ON devices, XY represents the pair interactions of devices 8 x and y and |tx| is the absolute value of the transition caused by the switching of device x. The above two 9 equations were derived from the fact that when a device turns ON, its main effect (power consumption) 10 will be added to the aggregate signal plus all possible interactions with already operating devices. The 11 contrary behavior happens when a device goes into OFF state. 12 To illustrate the above, we can rewrite equation (11) as 13 𝑎𝑏 − 𝑏 = (𝑎 − 𝑖) + 2 ∙ 𝐴𝐵 (15) 14 Since the term (𝑎 − 𝑖) gives an approximate value for the main factor A, we can write 15 |𝑡𝑥| = 𝑎𝑏 − 𝑏 ≈ 𝐴 + 2 ∙ 𝐴𝐵 (16) 16 Therefore, the algorithm searches for the most probable device x that caused the transition in the total 17 aggregate signal considering interactions with currently operating devices. Algorithms such as [1, 5 and 18 7] search for the device x without considering others devices that are already in operation. Our proposed 19 method have considered devices interactions which aid in the disaggregation process. Test results on the 20 public REDD data set showed an improved accuracy on disaggregation as illustrated in section 5. 21 Since power measurement has normal fluctuations, we only considered significant transitions larger than 22 some threshold. A threshold of 25 W was used in our approach testing. We used this moderate threshold 23 because a lower value will make the system very sensitive to small changes in the aggregate signal, while 24 a higher threshold may result in missing smaller changes and low power consuming devices may not to be 25 detected. 26 4.3. Procedure of the energy disaggregation algorithm 27 Our energy disaggregation approach can thus be summarized in the following steps: 28 - Step 1: using an initial portion of the aggregate total signal, models of devices were built and 29 devices interactions were estimated. It is possible to estimate an interaction between two devices 30 only if we can observe each device when operating alone and when both are operating together at 31 different time instants. 32 - Step 2: the process of disaggregation was performed on the remaining part of the aggregate total 33 signal. 34 11 - Step 3: accuracy of disaggregation was evaluated by comparing the resulting estimates to actual 1 individual consumptions of devices obtained from the REDD public data set. The accuracy metric 2 in 2.4.1 was used to assess our approach. 3 As in many other proposed approaches [4], we are still unable to detect or classify continuously 4 variable devices. Only single state or FSM devices can be disaggregated by our approach. Since 5 unsupervised approaches result in unlabeled groups, manual matching of the devices was performed at the 6 end of the process. 7 5. RESULTS 8 We used the low frequency data measurements of house 2 available in REDD public data set [10] 9 to carry out and test the proposed approach. House 2 was used to illustrate our approach as it includes 10 only nine devices, which made it easier to investigate interactions per pair of devices. The nine devices 11 are microwave, refrigerator, outlet 1, outlet 2, washer dryer, lights, stove, dishwasher and disposal. These 12 devices are fed by two phases, which are labeled as mains1 and mains 2. 13 Firstly, the base load was determined by observing the minimum level of consumed power in both 14 mains 1 and mains 2 circuits. They were found to be as shown in Table 3. The base loads here represent 15 the response i in Table 2 when all other devices are assumed to be in the OFF state. 16 Table 3. Base load for mains 1 and mains 2. 17 Circuit Mains 1 Mains 2 Base load (W) 15.7 22.8 Although the base load could include devices that are always ON, we considered this as the 18 response i because all significant devices to be detected are still in the OFF state. The always ON devices 19 are lumped together to represent the response when all other significant devices (to be detected) are OFF. 20 Using the disaggregation procedure described in subsection 4.3, the energy disaggregation was 21 carried out. In step 1, models were built according to the detected devices in a two-day portion of 22 aggregate data. Unseen or rarely used devices can be added during the disaggregation process (step 2). In 23 step 1, we were able to estimate three interactions between corresponding observed devices and they are 24 as shown in Table 4. 25 Table 4. Estimated interactions between observed devices. 26 Device A Device B Interaction AB (W) Outlet 1 Outlet 2 -27.7 Outlet 2 Unknown (40 W) -12.5 Refrigerator Microwave -31.5 In step 2, the disaggregation task was performed on the measured total signal of one-day length 27 sequences separately. As an illustration, consider the microwave and refrigerator case. In step 1 of the 28 disaggregation procedure described in subsection 4.3, we observed that the average power consumptions 29 of the microwave and the refrigerator are 1935 W and 238 W respectively. Thereafter, these amounts 30 were assigned to their consumption estimates whenever they were detected in the disaggregation process. 31 The only exception was when they were detected to be operating together simultaneously. In this case, 32 their individual consumptions were estimated to be decreased by 31.5 W (see Table 4). 33 In step 3, comparisons of outcome estimates of power consumptions to actual consumptions per 34 device was done to find the disaggregation accuracy for individual devices. They are as shown in Table 5. 35 We have repeated the experiment twice, once considering the interactions in hidden Markov chains and 36 another by ignoring them (setting to zero) as in the standard FHMM. The accuracy of the estimated 37 12 consumption of each device was evaluated in order to understand the impact of considering their 1 interactions specifically. 2 Table 5. Disaggregation accuracy for devices with/without interaction models. 3 Device FHMM (Interaction ignored) FHMM (Interaction considered) Microwave 54.26% 57.29% Outlet 2 78.66% 81.40% Refrigerator 64.11% 64.57% Outlet 1 68.66% 68.80% Washer dryer 77.26% 77.26% Lights 51.62% 51.66% Stove 81.56% 81.56% Figures 7 shows the estimated and the actual consumption patterns of the washer dryer in a given 4 time period, respectively. As can be seen from the figure, the proposed method of energy disaggregation 5 gives quite good estimation of the actual consumption pattern of the washer dryer. 6 7 Fig. 7. Estimated and actual power consumption of the washer dryer. 8 6. DISCUSSION 9 The addition of interaction property chains to the FHMM in our proposed approach considers the 10 behavior of a device when there are different other devices operating in the background. The proposed 11 model showed an improvement in the disaggregation accuracy whenever a mutual interaction between 12 two devices was observed and estimated. 13 In step 1 of the proposed disaggregation procedure described in subsection 4.3, we were able to 14 observe and estimate a limited number of interactions. This is because to estimate an interaction between 15 4.9 5 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 5.6 x 10 4 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Time (s)Power (W) Estimated Vs Actual Power Consumption of the Washer Dryer Estimated Actual 13 two devices, we must be able to observe each device operating alone in different time instants, in addition 1 to observing when both are operating simultaneously. These conditions limits the probability to estimate 2 interactions between a pair of devices. In reality, each pair of devices could interact, either with small or 3 significant amount. Whenever we are able to estimate the interactions, they will help to improve the 4 accuracy of disaggregation process as illustrated in our example. The transition of the unknown device in 5 Table 4 was detected but we were unable to match with any of known devices in the household. It could 6 belong to an unmeasured device since all other devices have no such transition in their consumptions at 7 the same time instant. Hence, it was given a generic unknown device name. 8 From the disaggregation results, it can be seen that embedding interaction characteristics to FHMM 9 improved the disaggregation accuracy for a set of devices such as the microwave, refrigerator, outlet 1 10 and outlet 2. No significant change in accuracy was obtained for the rest of other devices as no interaction 11 was observed from the set of measured data for these devices. This showed that energy consumption was 12 assigned more accurately to devices with known interaction properties. It is observed that either we 13 embed interaction chains to FHMM or not, devices with unknown mutual interactions were not 14 significantly affected in terms of the disaggregation accuracy. The results showed a noticeable 15 enhancement to accuracy for devices with known interaction property. For reasonable comparisons, we 16 may compare our results to those obtained in literature where the same accuracy metric is used (e.g. in 17 [10, 11]). In [10], achieved accuracies were in the range of 59.6% to 71.5%. In [11], only 5 devices were 18 considered. Thus, achieved accuracy range was increased to be 77.7% to 84.8%. Our proposed method 19 can thus provide improved estimations of daily and monthly consumptions of the different devices in the 20 household. This is useful when giving advice to home users about the energy consumptions of different 21 devices and possible recommendations for energy savings. 22 Two other devices in house 2, the dishwasher and the disposal, were not shown in Table 5. From 23 the individual power consumption data in REDD, it can be seen that the dishwasher operated only once 24 during the entire two weeks period when data was collected. This may be sufficient to build a model but 25 the device was not used again for the rest of the two weeks period for detection by our proposed 26 disaggregation algorithm. The disposal consumed varying powers over the period of data collection and 27 such device cannot be detected by our proposed algorithm. 28 7. CONCLUSION 29 The property of devices interactions was estimated and embedded in a FHMM representation to 30 improve energy disaggregation accuracy. Although devices interactions would mean low power quality in 31 their design or in electricity network components, we utilized this characteristic to further enhance the 32 energy disaggregation. The new approach was tested in a selected home from available public data. 33 Models were first built and possible interactions were observed from a portion of aggregate total signal. 34 Then, the disaggregation process was performed on the remaining portion. It was found that devices with 35 known mutual interactions were detected with higher accuracy than those with unknown interactions. The 36 new model contributed in assigning consumed energy to devices more accurately. The essential impact of 37 this work is to influence the house’s occupants to adopt better energy saving usage for devices that would 38 lead to valuable savings. For the future work, we look to evaluate and test our algorithm in different 39 houses so as to increase the confidence about the proposed algorithm. 40 8.
