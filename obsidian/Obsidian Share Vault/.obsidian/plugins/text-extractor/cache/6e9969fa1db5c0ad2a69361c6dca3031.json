Allen, Chris Berg, Nataliya Ilyushina and Jason Pot ts1 Block chain Inno vation Hub, RMIT University 4 May 2023 Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) or generative AI have emerged as a new general-purpose technology in applied machine learning. These models are increasingly emplo yed within firms to support a range of economic tasks. This paper investigates the economic value generated by the adop tion and use of LLMs, which oft en occur s on an experimen tal basis, through two main channels. The first channel, already explor ed in the literature (e. g. Eloundou et al. 2023, No y and Wang 2023), involv es LLMs pr o viding pr oductiv e support akin to other capit al investments or tools. The second, less examined channel concerns the reduction or elimination of agency cos ts in economic or ganisation due to the enhanced ability of economic actor s to insour ce mor e tasks. This is particularly relevant for tasks that pr eviously requir ed con tracting within or outside a firm. With LLMs enabling work ers to perf orm tasks in which they had less specialisa tion, the cos ts associa ted with managing relationship s and con tracts decrease. This paper focuses on this second pa th of value creation through adop tion of this inno vative new general purpose technology . Furthermor e, we examine the wider implic ations of the lo wer agency cos ts pa thway on inno vation, entrepr eneurship and compe tition. 1 . Introduction Recent inno vations in artificial intelligence (AI), specific ally large language models (LLMs), 2 have led to the developmen t of a po werful and disrup tive new categor y of consumer and business technologies (Ag arwal et al. 2019, Acemoglu and Restrepo 2020, Zarifhoniv ar 2023, Felton et al. 2023). LLMs repr esent a new 'general-purpose technology' that can be built upon and utilised across all industries (Br esnahan and Trajtenberg 1995, Trajtenberg 2019). This paper examines ho w LLMs create economic value. The con ventional answer to this ques tion is that AI enhances pr oductivity by pr o viding a new form of technology -embodied capit al that substitutes for labour through automa tion. In this per spectiv e, AI enables individuals to accomplish mor e with better and smarter tools. Consequen tly, researchers can measure the impact of this new capit al as increases in marginal pr oductivity (Corr ado 2021, Damioli 2021, Seamans and Raj 2018, Furman and Seamans 2019). Ho wever, some deeper structural effects also con tribute to the value creation associa ted with LLM adop tion and usage. We pr opose that the mos t significant effect lies in the impact on con tracting and the 2 These are so metimes called ‘fo undatio n mo dels’ ( Bo mmasani et al 2 0 2 1 ) o r ‘generative AI’. 1 Written with assistance o f ChatGPT ( GPT-4 ) , Bing Chat, and Go o gle Bard ( see Berg 2 0 2 3 fo r discussio n) . 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4437679 elimination of many related cos ts, particularly agency cos ts. In this paper , we apply a new institutional economics framework, focusing on the influence of transaction cos ts on con tracting and firm or ganisation (Coase 1937, Williamson 1985, Hart 1988), to understand the con tribution of LLMs to the econom y. An LLM combines deep pools of specialis t kno wledge (the trained model) with loc al kno wledge (the user pr omp ts and actions in a pr oblem solving con text). But this can differently affect economic or ganisation depending on the specific margin of use. Consider a per son in a firm that uses LLM to do: (1) part of their o wn tasks; (2) a co-w ork ers task; or (3) an outsour ced task. These have different institutional consequences, variously: (1) increasing marginal pr oductivity and equilibrium wage; (2) reducing managerial and go vernance cos ts (smaller firms); and (3) reducing agency cos ts (less con tracting in the market). When they use LLM to perf orm their o wn tasks, ceteris paribus , they are mor e pr oductiv e and their firm is mor e compe titive. When they use LLM to perf orm the task of someone else in their firm, but with whom they were pr eviously join tly pr oducing value, then the other labour resour ce is redundant, and the no w smaller firm is mor e compe titive. This is due to lo wer direct cos ts (the no w redundant labour), but also lo wer indirect costs of con tracting and managing that labour . In the limit, these governanc e costs go to zero if the firm becomes just one per son. Because the firm is no w smaller (but with the same output), the go vernance cos ts are reduced. This is one channel by which LLMs create economic value by economising on go vernance cos ts. Another closely related channel is when an insider uses a LLM to perf orm the tasks of someone outside the firm, which the firm was con tracting for join t pr oduction (Williamson 1985). This is a direct reduction in transaction costs and agency costs. In this instance, the use of LLMs as an artificial agent substitutes for human agency and its associa ted con tracting hazards and cos ts. In both of these instances, the economic benefit and socie tal value of LLM adop tion and use therefor e is greater than just the first or der benefits from pr oductivity enhancing automa tion, but extends to the elimination of a range of con tracting hazards and monit oring cos ts that will manifest in changed economic or ganisation due to the elimination of a range of agency cos ts and go vernance cos ts. 2 . LLMs are a new general purpose technology The sour ce of this value creation through the elimination of a range of cos ts is an institutional inno vation built from a particular applic ation of AI as a ‘comput ational mechanical mind’ instantiated in deep neural network s that are trained on very large text-based data sets, hence ‘large language models’ . 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4437679 The concep t of a comput ational mechanical mind has been around since at least the nineteenth century (Husbands 2008). Ho wever, despit e decades of pr omises to revolutionise the world, AI has oft en yielded underwhelming results. Primarily, AI has been deeply embedded in large corpor ate and go vernment oper ations, focusing on calculations and scheduling to impr o ve efficiency. While many have experienced its administrative effects, access to po werful AI tools has been limited for the average per son. Common encoun ters with advanced AI have been limited to everyday tools such as voice assistants (e. g., Siri on Apple devices), autoc orr ect features (e. g., in Google), and recommender algorithms (e. g., in Netflix). Consequen tly, mos t people have not had the opportunity to experimen t, hack, or inno vate with po werful AI themselves. Around 2018, inno vative ideas about layered neural network s, specific ally deep-learning appr oaches (V aswani et al. 2017, Radfor d et al. 2018), led to the developmen t of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Bommasani et al. 2021). LLMs repr esent the first affor dable, fast, and po werful consumer -orien ted (i.e., desktop) artificial intelligence toolse ts. Generative pr etrained transformer s are no w recogniz ed as a new general-purpose technology (GP T), as ap tly phr ased by Eloundou et al. 2023: \"GPTs are GPTs.\" Like electricity, a GPT from a pr evious era (see Lip sey et al. 2005), the impact of this new inno vation will be both creative and destructive, generating a pla tform for new services, businesses, job s, and economic opportunities while displacing old methods and consequen tly affecting revenue and capit al value. Ho wever, the specific ways in which LLMs will disrup t the economic landscape depend on the no vel value they create and what they replace or complemen t. The primar y aim of this paper is to clarify ho w a reduction in agency cos ts is a significant sour ce of value creation resulting from LLM adop tion and use. 3 . Simple economics of AI Economis ts who study technologic al change and labour markets are already working on understanding the economic disrup tion to job s and occupa tions of AI (Erns t et al. 2019, Felton et al. 2023). This work focuses on the types of task automa tion that AIs can achieve, and the ways that AI tools can complemen t or substitute for existing job s. The study of the economic impact of founda tion models follo ws from the ‘simple economics of AI’, which is essentially a pr ediction technology in the form of a comple x statistical model that outputs ‘what comes next’ (Agr awal et al. 2018). The pr ediction-machine model of AI in general, and of generative pr etrained transformer (GP T) models in particular , is a model of technologic al inno vation creating a new type of capit al (i.e. an intermediate good) that is broadly complemen tary with labour inputs. The sour ce of the inno vation is a dramatic fall in computing cos ts, diffusion of the internet and devices, and lo wer barriers for entry for new AI startup s. Productivity enhancements due to automa tion in particular tasks and job s, which facilitates higher pr oductivity for existing labour resour ces, as well as also making possible a mor e efficient reor ganisation of 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4437679 pr oduction (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2019, Aghion et al. 2019). As Trajenberg (2019) explains, AI technologies bring “two typ es o f inno vatio ns ( human enhancing inno vatio ns and human rep lacing inno vatio ns) that have very different effects o n key eco no mic and so cial variables. It wo uld seem that AI-based human enhancing inno vatio ns have the p o tential to unleash a new wave o f human creativity and p ro ductivity, p articularly in services” AI adop tion can enhance the pr oductivity of lo w-skilled work or work cons trained by specific skills gap s or capabilities (f or instance AI map s enable drivers who have general driving skills but lack specific kno wledge of a city to be as pr oductiv e as mor e kno wledgeable drivers). AI can also substitute for particular roles in a pr oduction pr ocess, for instance a matching algorithm replacing a human dispa tcher in scheduling taxis. In this instance, given the o verall pr oduct is still the same, but with lo wer cos ts, remaining work ers will have a higher marginal pr oduct and equilibrium wage. Machine learning AI is a branch of comput ational statistics in which comput ers 'learn’ from sample data, and in which the learning is cap tured in par ameterized neural nets. They pr oduce data from data as comput ation. Because the outputs of an AI create new data or actions in the world and can be fed back in as inputs into other AIs, these learning models can pot entially boots trap inno vation. Aghion et al. (2018) use an endog enous gro wth model to sho w ho w AI, as an input into the pr oduction of new ideas, could drive exponen tial gro wth. In these types of models of digital economic pr oduction and inno vation, the sour ce of economic value pr o vided by the new technology is due to the pr oductivity gains that accrue to investment in a new type of capit al (i.e. complemen tarity), along with the structural consequences of economic reor ganisation (i.e. substitution). 3 This is a pr oduction function appr oach to understanding the sour ce of economic value of the new technology and is essentially no different to the economic effect of investment in other generic types of technology -augmented capit al goods and machine automa tion (such as robots in factories or washing machines in houses) in which labour pr oductivity impr o ves because of greater investment in capit al goods. But a different appr oach to the economic effect of a new general purpose technology is to focus on economic or ganisation and exchange using transaction cos t analysis (i.e. new institutional economics and informa tion economics). 3 David ( 1 9 9 0 ) p resents a classic analysis o f ho w the p ro ductivity benefits o f electrificatio n and electric mo to rs were o nly realised when facto ries underwent redesign to leverage the new o rganisatio nal p o ssibilities o ffered by the techno lo gy, a p ro cess that sp anned decades. David's argument drew p arallels with the seemingly absent p ro ductivity benefits o f co mp uters in the late 1 9 8 0 s. In a similar vein, we argue that the true p o tential o f LLMs will be unlo cked when o rganisatio ns adap t and restructure to take full advantage o f the o p p o rtunities these advanced mo dels p ro vide. This transitio n, much like the o nes befo re, may also req uire an extended p erio d o f time and adjustments to fully reap the p ro ductivity benefits. 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4437679 4 . Institutional economics of LLMs The focus on the economic implic ations of agency cos ts related to LLM generative AI technology is part of a larger narrative concerning the financial impact of emerging digital comput ation technologies. These technologies encompass block chain smart con tracts, oft en referred to as web3, and are best characterised as institutional technologies (Da vidson et al. 2018). In a con tempor ary econom y, the majority of technologic al advancements involv e the developmen t of new or impr o ved pr oducts and services. This encompasses no vel designs and methods, inno vative materials and pr ocesses, oft en integrated into new capit al goods and eventually resulting in new pr oducts and services. This is the typic al understanding of technologic al change (Fr eeman and Soe te 1995, Arthur 2009). Although frequen tly linked to pr oducer inno vation driven by pr ofit and initiated by entrepr eneurial companies engaged in Schumpe terian compe tition, support ed by venture financing and intellectual pr operty rights, this concep t also encompasses open and user inno vation models (v on Hippel 2005, 2010, 2017, Pot ts 2023). Institutional inno vation, although less frequen t, can be equally economic ally impactful. Unlike pr oduction cos ts or capabilities, it primarily functions through transaction cos ts, or the expenses and pot ential for economic coor dination. For example, the economic advantages of block chain and smart con tract technology oft en materialise through technologic al features like digital assets, automa ted execution, or atomic settlement, resulting from reduced trust cos ts and diminished risks of opportunism in con tracting (Ber g et al. 2019, De Filippi et al. 2020, Davidson and Pot ts 2022). The pot ential for impr o vement is substantial, as No vak et al. (2018) estimate that trust cos ts accoun t for around one-thir d of tot al expenditur e or income in a modern econom y. Similarly, the economic benefits of LLMs stem from reducing agency and go vernance cos ts. Although these cos ts are not typic ally accoun ted for or easily quan tifiable, they are real expenses that manifest in specific economic or ganisational structures and hold a similar level of significance. Consequen tly, alterations in these cos ts will fundamentally transform economic or ganisation. To accurately compr ehend the economic impact of generative AI and LLMs, it is essential to concen trate on the restructuring of economic or ganisation driven by changes in agency and go vernance cos ts. ChatGPT has become the fastest-gro wing web pla tform in histor y (Cho w 2023), with much of its gro wth stemming from quasi-e xperimen tal task-level business applic ations inside firms, in many cases done discreetly with work ers using CHatGPT and similar tools at their o wn initiative. One distinct use case for ChatGPT-like LLM models involv es decision-support, of fering supplemen tary analytical capabilities or substituting additional support from internal specialis ts or external consult ants in fields such as finance, accoun ting, marketing, or engineering. 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4437679 LLMs can grant agents access to an extensive kno wledge base, analytical skills, and decision-making tools, pot entially impr o ving their decision-making aligned with the principal's interests or enabling the principal to inexpensiv ely verify the quality of the agent's work and advice. By enhancing decision-making quality , LLM models can help reduce residual losses caused by the agent's subop timal actions. Additionally , LLM models can automa te various tasks and decision-making pr ocesses, decreasing the need for principals to heavily invest in monit oring their agents' actions. For example, LLMs can pr ocess and analyse financial data, track perf ormance metrics, or assist in pr oject management, pr o viding principals with mor e transpar ent and timely informa tion regarding their agents' actions. The use of LLMs, or mor e broadly , founda tion models with APIs, effectively functions as a form of insour cing (\"mak e\" rather than \"buy\" in the language of industrial or ganisation theor y), which can mitigate pot ential con flicts arising from asymmetric informa tion and opportunism hazards (Klein et al. 1978, Grossman and Hart 1986). LLMs take this logic a step further, not only within a firm but also by incorpor ating tasks within an individual, eliminating both transaction cos ts associa ted with using a market and agency and go vernance cos ts related to using a firm. Holms trom (1989) not ed that smaller firms excel at inno vation because reduced task heterog eneity leads to lo wer management cos ts. A principal may struggle to ob serve an agent's work or assess the value and pot ential of a pr oject disco vered by the agent. As a result, cos t savings can be symmetrical, whether the LLM is adop ted by the principal or the agent, although the mechanisms differ: the principal experiences reduced monit oring cos ts (without the agent), while the agent benefits from impr o ved alignment (without the principal). Comple ting tasks oneself can consider ably reduce the advantages of specializ ation and gains from trade while also cutting do wn on the cos ts of using the market. LLMs enable greater 'vertical integration' within a single role by increasing the number of tasks an individual can perf orm, resulting in a pur e pr oductivity increase due to augmented capit al. This or ganizational effect is equiv alent to reducing various con tracts within a firm or in the market. From the firm's per spectiv e, an individual equipped with an LLM can no w perf orm mor e tasks within the same time frame (and con tract), thus reducing the need for additional con tracts and lo wering transaction and monit oring cos ts associa ted with task execution. This is separ ate from the labor -saving effect of substitution. An alternative per spectiv e is that by using an LLM, an individual can avoid a con tracting situation, such as hiring a pr of essional service (e. g., accoun tant, lawyer, or coder) to assist with a task. In this case, the cos t saving includes both the direct cos t (the agent's salary) and 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4437679 the agency cos ts incurred from monit oring or bonding the agent. Additionally , there are reduced cos ts in transferring loc al or specific kno wledge from the principal to the agent. Jensen and Meckling (1992) ob served that as the import ance of specific kno wledge within a firm increases, a decentralized or ganizational structure becomes mor e efficient, allo wing decision-making authority to be delegated to individuals with the relevant specific kno wledge. In con trast, when general kno wledge is mor e vital, a centralized or ganizational structure may be mor e suitable, as it enables the firm to utilize its central decision-mak ers' general kno wledge mor e effectively. Some of these cos ts might already be factor ed into the con tract price, which includes a compe titive cos t plus a screening or agency cos t related to mitigating opportunism hazards (e. g., pa ying for reput ation or bonding cos ts). Eliminating these agency cos ts, which are oft en high for pr of essional services, results in a pur e economic gain from LLM adop tion and cons titutes a significant sour ce of socie tal economic benefits from founda tion models. The economic advantages of a firm are also influenced by the exclusive resour ces accessible within the or ganisation, with informa tion being a key resour ce. Accor ding to the Alchian-Demsetz (1972) model, a firm functions as a 'priv ate market' where insiders can ob serve and act on informa tion about loc al pr oductivity or opportunities. Insiders or ganising pr ojects possess mor e informa tion than outsider s financing them. Nevertheless, all feasible pr ojects will incur some deadweight agency cos ts as outsider s monit or insiders. Ho wever, the mor e unencumbered wealth (c olla teral) insiders con tribute, the lo wer the agency cos ts will be. There is a financing consider ation to this effect too. Deadweight agency cos ts related to inno vation are lo wer when entrepr eneurs' investments are financially solv ent. Bernanke and Gertler (1986) highlight that during financial crises (i.e., bear markets), insiders will have lo wer colla teral, resulting in higher agency cos ts for outsider s. They specific ally find that \"the coun ter-cyclicality of agency cos ts in capit al finance induces greater vola tility in investment and output than would other wise exist.\" This suggests that the incentive to adop t LLMs, which reduce agency cos ts, should be higher during bear markets. The up shot is that LLM technology is economic ally equiv alent to shrinking the size of the firm without changing the pr oduction set, i.e. it pot entially brings the pr oductivity benefits of a large firm or market con tracting with the or ganisational efficiency benefits of a much smaller firm with lo wer monit oring cos ts, agency cos ts and go vernance cos ts. This is the nature of the economic value that is created by the adop tion and use of LLM technology . 5 . LLMs and distributed innovation The agency cos t theor y of LLM adop tion suggests that user inno vation and pr oblem-solving become mor e effective due to impr o ved access to specialised kno wledge capabilities (lo wer 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4437679 cos t pr oduction) and reduced cos ts of or ganising that kno wledge (lo wer agency and go vernance cos ts). This theor y pr edicts a mor e decentralised inno vation system, with increased inno vation in households or at the fringes (v on Hippel, 2005, 2017). This decentralisation creates additional value by leveraging loc al kno wledge (Ha yek, 1945) or \"sticky informa tion\" (v on Hippel, 1998) as inputs for inno vation. The \"toolkit\" model of user inno vation, developed by von Hippel and Katz (2002), of fers a help ful framework for analysing the benefits of LLMs for inno vation. In this model, the trained LLM serves as a toolkit that decentralised inno vator s can access and utilise for pr oblem-solving by integrating their unique pr oblem con text and needs. There is already emerging evidence of self-or ganising user communities sharing pr omp ts and tip s on using LLMs for pr oblem-solving , including the developmen t of educational con tent (Mollick & Mollick, 2023). 6 . LLMs, entrepreneurship and market competition LLMs like ChatGPT also have significant implic ations for entrepr eneurship, venture finance, and market compe tition. This per spectiv e aligns with the Austrian view on LLMs and extends the New Institutional economics view on LLMs . The emergence of lo w-cos t access to LLMs for work ers can be compar ed to adding extra skilled work ers, consult ants, or con tractor s to a firm. It has a similar effect to capit al investment, as it enhances work er capabilities by enabling further specialisa tion, faster pr oduction, or the use of mor e comple x pr oduction technologies. In terms of Austrian capit al theor y, this pr ocess facilitates mor e roundabout pr oduction, similar to an increased investment in capit al (Garrison, 2001). Ho wever, LLMs lo wer the cos t of or ganising human capit al, effectively allo wing for mor e \"simulated or virtual\" human capit al to be put into pr oductiv e use.4 By automa ting and simplif ying tasks, LLMs enable work ers and entrepr eneurs to focus on mor e specialised and higher-or der tasks, boos ting pr oductivity . These models op timise structures by streamlining communic ation, enhancing collabor ation, and reducing time spen t on repe titive or lo w-skilled tasks. This resembles human capit al deepening but is focused on individual work ers without sacrificing specialisa tion or incurring additional or ganisational cos ts, due to reduced agency cos ts. A key consequence of LLM adop tion is the reduction of the effective size of a firm. When framed within the con text of Austrian capit al theor y, it implies that LLMs lo wer the cos ts of entrepr eneurship by decreasing the effective size and resour ce requir ements of entrepr eneurial startup s. This, in turn, means that the venture finance needed for launching 4 cf. Allen et a l., 2 0 2 0 o n the effect o f lo wering the co st o f trust o n cap ital structure. 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4437679 a startup will be lo wer, given the smaller team size or increased speed of execution. As a result, market con testability will likely increase. By reducing the cos t of entrepr eneurship, LLMs are expect ed to boos t compe tition in mos t markets. This increased compe tition will erode market rents, benefiting consumer s as pr oducer s adop t LLMs. A secondar y effect could be that as LLMs short en the time period of pr oduction for labour , work ers may choose to alloc ate mor e time to leisure or other activities, as the opportunity cos t of work decreases. This shift in time pr eference could impact labour supply and o verall pr oductivity . 7 . Conclusion This paper has pr esented a no vel per spectiv e root ed in New Institutional Economics, exploring the effects of adop ting and utilising large language model (LLM) technology , such as ChatGPT. We argue that beyond the primar y effects of increased pr oductivity , which can be compar ed to a rise in capit al for the firm or human capit al for the work er, there is a secondar y effect resulting from the or ganisational and con tractual changes brough t on by this capability enhancement. Specific ally, lo wer cos ts associa ted with economic pr oduction, including entrepr eneurship, emerge due to reduced agency cos ts involv ed in monit oring and managing additional work ers and mitigating opportunis tic hazards. The central pr emise of this paper is that the widespr ead adop tion and use of LLMs as a new general-purpose technology will lead to reduced agency and go vernance cos ts, con tributing to loc al and global benefits. This additional sour ce of value creation is not typic ally associa ted with new general-purpose technologies but is likely characteristic of LLMs. Additionally , we have discussed ho w these benefits will be distributed throughout socie ty. We posit that the advantages are likely to be cap tured in two ways: first, by early and successful adop ters of the technology , who can leverage or negotia te higher wages within a firm due to their increased marginal revenue pr oduct, or cap ture pr ofits through entrepr eneurial activities. Second, consumer s will benefit from greater market con testability resulting from the use of LLMs. Future research could explor e the long-t erm effects of LLM adop tion on market structures, emplo yment dynamics, and wage distribution. Investigating the pot ential risks associa ted with LLM use, such as labour malinvestment or the exacerbation of existing inequalities, will also be crucial in understanding the broader implic ations of this technology . Mor eo ver, examining the role of regulator y framework s and policies in shaping the developmen t and deplo yment of LLMs will be essential in ensuring that their benefits are maximised, and pot ential adverse consequences are mitigated. 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4437679 References Acemo glu, D., Restrep o , P., ( 2 0 2 0 ) ‘Ro bo ts and jo bs: Evidence fro m US labo r markets’ Journa l of Politica l Economy, 1 2 8 ( 6 ) : 2 1 8 8 –2 2 4 4 .
