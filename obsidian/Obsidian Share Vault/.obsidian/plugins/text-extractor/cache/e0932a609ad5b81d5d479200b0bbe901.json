Every three years, Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections (SDCI) staff start the code update process with a review of the changes made by the National Fire Protection Associa- tion in the latest edition of the National Electrical Code (NEC). They also review Washington Administrative Code (WAC) changes affecting electrical work and installations. This infor- mation is used to develop code changes designed to improve Seattle’s code. The public and vari- ous stakeholders are asked to submit and comment on proposed changes. A committee appointed by the City’s Construction Codes Advisory Board (CCAB) reviews these proposed changes. The committee includes electrical engineers, electrical contractors, and other professionals. Based on their feedback, we develop a draft ordinance of code changes. The draft ordinance is presented to the City’s Construction Codes Advisory Board (CCAB). The Board includes construction and design professionals who advise us about the impact of code changes on building safety, sustainability, and accessibility. We finalize code changes based on their recommendations. The ordinance is then reviewed and approved by the Seattle City Coun- cil. We are grateful to volunteers and City staff members who helped create the 2020 SEC. The re- sult of their combined efforts is a code that improves the safety of electrical equipment and in- stallations for everyone who visits, lives, or works in Seattle: Electrical Code Review Committee Charles E. Beck, Georginna Lucas, Haley Krommenhoek, Tony Penna, Warren Shill, Brian Kemly, Niels Fallisgaard, Joe Tremblay, JP Wittman SDCI Electrical Program Staff Tim Rasmussen, John Saldana, Scott Lau, Pat Foss, Ben Scott, Joe Kraft, Carol Kenefick City Attorney’s Office (Legislative Editors) Brandon Isleib and Phil Wood-Smith Technical Codes Program Staff Jenifer Gilliland iv Frequently Asked Questions What is this document? This document contains sections of the 2020 National Electrical Code (NEC) that have been modi- fied in some way by The City of Seattle. It also includes changes made by the State of Washing- ton to the NEC found in the Washington Administrative Code. This document is not the entire Seattle Electrical Code. Together, the 2020 NEC and the changes in these insert pages make up the full 2020 Seattle Electrical Code. You can purchase a copy of the 2020 National Electrical Code from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) by following this link: https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-stand- ards/detail?code=70 How do I use this document? This pages of this document are a set of “insert pages” meant to be added to the loose-leaf edi- tion of the 2020 National Electrical Code (NEC) as published by the National Fire Protection As- sociation (NFPA), also known as NFPA 70®. You can use the page numbers on the bottom of the insert page as a guide to get the Seattle amendments in the right location in the loose-leaf edition of the NEC. For instance, if you have a change on page 70-52.1 of the insert pages, you place the replacement page opposite page 52 in the loose-leaf edition of the NEC. The “70” stands for NPFA standard 70. It also means it is the first of what could be several pages that are inserted in this location. For instance, if the page number is 70-52.3, it means that you insert this as the third page after page 52. What are informational notes? This document includes “informational notes” that refer to rules adopted by the State of Wash- ington, which are known as Washington Administrative Code (WAC) rules. Some WAC rules are included “word-for-word” in this document, while others have been edited. If a 2020 SEC requirement is different than what the WAC requires, which one do I follow? You must comply with the Seattle requirements found in this document. What do the notations in the 2020 NEC and the Seattle insert pages mean? Shaded text Gray shading shows substantive changes, not just the correction of “typos” made by NFPA to the National Electrical Code. A figure caption with gray shading changes an existing figure. Underlined text Text added by The City of Seattle to the 2020 SEC. ((struck text)) Text eliminated by The City of Seattle and not enforced by the City. N New sections, tables, and figures (bold, italic N in a gray box to the left of the new material). An N next to an article title indicates that the entire article is new. Δ A new change made by NFPA within a section or subsection of the 2020 NEC. • When one of more paragraphs have been eliminated in the 2020 edition of the NEC, the deletion is indicated by a bullet (•) between the remaining para- graphs. v What’s New? Every three years, the Seattle City Council approves changes to the requirements of the National Electrical Code (NEC) needed to adapt the code for use in Seattle. The NEC, with local changes, make up the Seattle Electrical Code (SEC). These local changes are generally carried forward into the next SEC edition. Many changes correct editorial and grammatical mistakes or bring clarity to existing code language. However, Seattle does adopt amendments every three years to re- spond to unique Seattle concerns. The following are highlights of changes made by Seattle dur- ing the adoption of the 2020 Seattle Electrical Code: Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Articles 220.57 and 625.27 are modified to align EV charging infrastructure requirements with the Land Use Code. Calculated Electric Load Article 220.84 is modified to prevent calculated excess service capacity when using advanced heat pump systems. Construction Documents Article 80.51(B) increases sizes of services and systems before the submittal of construction doc- uments is required.  The requirement trigging the need to submit construction documents for temporary ser- vices increased from 400 to 600 amperes. Temporary services under 600 amps can be processed using the over-the-counter process.  It is clarified that permanent services or feeders of 400 amperes or over require the sub- mittal of construction plans.  The requirement triggering the need to submit construction plans for photovoltaic and other renewable energy systems is increased from 7.7 kW to 12 kW. A one line drawing and manufacturer’s installation requirements to the field inspector prior to the first cover inspection is required for systems rated 12 kW and under. vi Electrical Code Review and Inspection Program What do we do?

Any person affected by the notice of violation may submit additional information to the authority having jurisdiction within ten days after the request for review is filed, unless the authority having jurisdiction and the person requesting the review agree to a different time period for documents to be submitted. (b) The review shall be made by a representative of the authority having jurisdiction who will review any additional information that is submitted and the basis for issuance of the notice of violation. The re- viewer may request clarification of the information received and a site visit. After the review, the authority having jurisdiction shall: 1. Sustain the notice; or 2. Withdraw the notice; or 3. Amend the notice; or 4. Continue the review to a date certain. (c) The authority having jurisdiction shall issue an order containing the decision within 15 days of the date that the review is completed and shall mail or cause the order to be mailed by regular first-class mail to the persons requesting the review and the persons named on the notice of violation, addressed to their last known addresses. This decision is the final order of the authority having jurisdiction. (C) Stop Work Orders. Whenever any installation, alteration, repair, or removal of electrical work is being done contrary to the provisions of this Code, or in the event of dangerous or unsafe conditions related to electrical work, the authority having jurisdiction may issue a stop work order describing the violation or unsafe condition at the site. No electrical work may proceed until the described violation or condition is corrected and approved by the authority having jurisdiction. (1) Service of Stop Work Order. The authority having jurisdiction may serve the stop work order by posting it in a conspicuous place at the site, if posting is physically possible. If posting is not physically possible the stop work order may be served by personal service or by first class mail to the last known address of the property owner, the person doing or causing the work to be done, and the holder of a permit if work is being stopped on a permit. For the purpose of this section, service is complete at the time of posting or of personal service, or if mailed, 3 days after the date of mailing. When the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or City holiday, the period runs until 5:00 p.m. on the next business day. (2) Effective Date of Stop Work Order. Stop work orders are effective when posted, or if posting is not physi- cally possible, when one of the persons identified in Section 80.11(B)(1) is served. (3) Review by the Authority Having Jurisdiction for Stop Work Orders (a) Any person aggrieved by a stop work order may obtain a review of the order by delivering to the au- thority having jurisdiction a request in writing within 2 business days of the date of service of the stop ARTICLE 80 — ADMINISTRATION 2020 SEATTLE ELECTRICAL CODE 70-28.9 work order. The review shall occur within 2 business days after receipt by the authority having juris- diction of the request for review unless the requestor agrees to a longer time. Any person aggrieved by or interested in the stop work order may submit additional information to the authority having jurisdic- tion for consideration as part of the review at any time prior to the review. (b) The review will be made by a representative of the authority having jurisdiction who will review all additional information received and may also request a site visit. After the review, the authority having jurisdiction may: (1) Sustain the stop work order; (2) Withdraw the stop work order; (3) Modify the stop work order; or (4) Continue the review to a date certain for receipt of additional information. (c) The authority having jurisdiction shall issue an order of the authority having jurisdiction containing the decision within 2 business days after the review and shall cause the order to be sent by first class mail to the person or persons requesting the review, any person on whom the stop work order was served, and any other person who requested a copy before issuance of the order, addressed to their last known address. (D) Civil Actions and Penalties. (1) Civil Penalties. Any person found violating or failing to comply with the provisions of this Code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the authority having jurisdiction has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation. (2) Enforcement in Municipal Court. Civil actions to enforce this chapter shall be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court, except as otherwise required by law or court rule. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of a notice of violation or of an order following a review by the authority having jurisdiction is not itself evidence that a violation exists. (3) Judicial Review. Because civil actions to enforce this Code must be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court pursuant to Subsection 80.13(D)(2), orders of the authority having jurisdiction, including notices of vi- olation issued under this chapter, are not subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 36.70C RCW. (4) Appeal to Superior Court. Final decisions of the Seattle Municipal Court on enforcement actions authorized by Title 22 and this Code may be appealed pursuant to the Rules for Appeal of Decisions of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction. (E) Alternative Criminal Penalty.

The purpose of this Code is the practical safeguarding of persons and property from hazards arising from the use of elec- tricity. This Code is not intended as a design specifi- cation or an instruction manual for untrained persons. (B) Adequacy. This Code contains provisions that are considered necessary for safety. Compliance therewith and proper maintenance result in an instal- lation that is essentially free from hazard but not nec- essarily efficient, convenient, or adequate for good service or future expansion of electrical use. Informational Note: Hazards often occur because of over- loading of wiring systems by methods or usage not in con- formity with this Code. This occurs because initial wiring did not provide for increases in the use of electricity. An in- itial adequate installation and reasonable provisions for sys- tem changes provide for future increases in the use of electricity. (C) Relation to Other International Standards. The requirements in this Code address the fundamen- tal principles of protection for safety contained in Section 131 of International Electrotechnical Commission Standard 60364-1, Electrical Installa- tions of Buildings. Informational Note: IEC 60364-1, Section 131, contains fundamental principles of protection for safety that encom- pass protection against electric shock, protection against thermal effects, protection against overcurrent, protection against fault currents, and protection against overvoltage. All of these potential hazards are addressed by the require- ments in this Code. 90.2 Scope. ∆ (A) Covered.

ARTICLE 230 — SERVICES 2020 SEATTLE ELECTRICAL CODE 70-96.1 230.95 Ground-Fault Protection of Equipment. Ground-fault protection of equipment shall be pro- vided for solidly grounded wye electric services of more than 150 volts to ground but not exceeding 1,000 volts phase-to-phase for each service disconnect rated 1,000 amperes or more. The grounded conductor for the solidly grounded wye system shall be connected directly to ground through a grounding electrode sys- tem, as specified in 250.50, without inserting any re- sistor or impedance device. The rating of the service disconnect shall be consid- ered to be the rating of the largest fuse that can be in- stalled or the highest continuous current trip setting for which the actual overcurrent device installed in a cir- cuit breaker is rated or can be adjusted. Exception: The ground-fault protection provisions of this section shall not apply to a service disconnect for a continuous industrial process where a nonorderly shutdown will introduce additional or increased haz- ards. (A) Setting. The ground-fault protection system shall operate to cause the service disconnect to open all un- grounded conductors of the faulted circuit. The maxi- mum setting of the ground-fault protection shall be 1,200 amperes, and the maximum time delay shall be one second for ground-fault currents equal to or greater than 3,000 amperes. (B) Fuses. If a switch and fuse combination is used, the fuses employed shall be capable of interrupting any current higher than the interrupting capacity of the switch during a time that the ground-fault protective system will not cause the switch to open. (C) Performance Testing. The ground-fault protec- tion system shall be performance tested when first in- stalled on site. ((This testing shall be conducted by a qualified person(s) using a test process of primary cur- rent injection, in accordance with instructions that shall be provided with the equipment.

N Part II. Disconnecting Means 706.15 Disconnecting Means. ∆ (A) ESS Disconnecting Means. A disconnecting means shall be provided for all ungrounded conductors derived from an ESS and shall be permitted to be inte- gral to listed ESS equipment. Where the ESS system is interactive with other electric power production source(s) and the ESS system disconnect is a knife switch that is not integral to the listed ESS equipment, the ESS system disconnect shall be of the heavy-duty type with two-way interlocking capability and shall comply with the requirements of 404.13(E), 705.20 and 706.16. The disconnecting means shall comply with all of the following: (1) The disconnecting means shall be readily ac- cessible. (2) The disconnecting means shall be located within sight of the ESS. Where it is impractical to install the disconnecting means within sight of the ESS, the disconnect shall be installed as close as practicable, and the location of the dis- connecting means shall be field marked on or immediately adjacent to the ESS. The marking shall be of sufficient durability to withstand the environment involved and shall not be hand- written. (3) The disconnecting means shall be lockable open in accordance with 110.25. For one-family and two-family dwellings, a discon- necting means or its remote control shall be located at a readily accessible location outside the building. ∆ (B) Remote Actuation. Where controls to activate the disconnecting means of an ESS are used and are not located within sight of the system, the location of the controls shall be field marked on the disconnecting means. ∆ (C) Notification and Marking. Each ESS discon- necting means shall plainly indicate whether it is in the open (off) or closed (on) position and be permanently marked “ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM DISCON- NECT.” The disconnecting means shall be legibly marked in the field to indicate the following: (1) Nominal ESS ac voltage and maximum ESS dc voltage (2) Available fault current derived from the ESS (3) An arc-flash label applied in accordance with acceptable industry practice (4) Date the calculation was performed Exception: List items (2), (3), and (4) shall not apply to one- and two-family dwellings. Informational Note No. 1: Industry practices for equipment labeling are described in NFPA 70E-2018, Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace. This standard provides specific criteria for developing arc- flash labels for equipment that provides nominal sys- tem voltage, incident energy levels, arc-flash bounda- ries, minimum required levels of personal protective equipment, and so forth. Informational Note No. 2: Battery equipment suppliers can provide information about available fault current on any particular battery model. For ESS disconnecting means where the line and load terminals may be energized in the open position, the device shall be marked with the following words or equivalent: WARNING ELECTRIC SHOCK HAZARD TERMINALS ON THE LINE AND LOAD SIDES MAY BE ENERGIZED IN THE OPEN POSITION The notification(s) and marking(s) shall comply with 110.21(B). ARTICLE 706 — ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS 2020 SEATTLE ELECTRICAL CODE 70-620.2 ∆ (D) Partitions Between Components. Where cir- cuits from the input or output terminals of energy stor- age components in an ESS pass through a wall, floor, or ceiling, a readily accessible disconnecting means shall be provided within sight of the energy storage component. Fused disconnecting means or circuit breakers shall be permitted to be used. ARTICLE 708 — CRITICAL OPERATIONS POWER SYSTEMS (COPS) 2020 SEATTLE ELECTRICAL CODE 70-628.1 ARTICLE 708 Critical Operations Power Systems (COPS) 708.54 Selective Coordination. Critical operations power system(s) overcurrent devices shall be selec- tively coordinated with all supply-side overcurrent protective devices. Selective coordination shall be selected by a licensed professional engineer or other qualified persons en- gaged primarily in the design, installation, or mainte- nance of electrical systems. The selection shall be documented and made available to those authorized to design, install, inspect, maintain, and operate the sys- tem. Exception No. 1: Selective coordination shall not be re- quired between two overcurrent devices located in series if no loads are connected in parallel with the downstream de- vice. Exception No. 2: When an electrical engineer provides stamped fault current calculations, the overcurrent protec- tive devices in each disconnecting means may be selectively coordinated with any other supply side overcurrent protec- tive devices for faults with a duration of 0.1 seconds and longer. Informational Note: See Informational Note Figure 708.54 for an example of how critical operations power system overcurrent protective devices (OCPDs) selectively coordinate with all supply-side OCPDs. OCPD D selectively coordinates with OCPDs C, F, E, B, and A. OCPD C selectively coordinates with OCPDs F, E, B, and A. OCPD F selectively coordinates with OCPD E. OCPD B is not required to selectively coordinate with OCPD A because OCPD B is not a critical operations power system OCPD. ARTICLE 708 — CRITICAL OPERATIONS POWER SYSTEMS (COPS) 2020 SEATTLE ELECTRICAL CODE 70-628.2 ARTICLE 710 — STAND-ALONE SYSTEMS 2020 SEATTLE ELECTRICAL CODE 70-628.3 ARTICLE 710 Stand-Alone Systems 710.15 General. Premises wiring systems shall be ad- equate to meet the requirements of this Code for simi- lar installations supplied by a feeder or service. The wiring on the supply side of the building or structure disconnecting means shall comply with the require- ments of this Code, except as modified by 710.15(A) through (G). (A) Supply Output. Power supply to premises wiring systems fed by stand-alone or isolated microgrid power sources shall be permitted to have less capacity than the calculated load. The capacity of the sum of all sources of the stand-alone supply shall be equal to or greater than the load posed by the largest single utili- zation equipment connected to the system. Calculated general lighting loads shall not be considered as a sin- gle load. Informational Note: For general-use loads the system capacity can be calculated using the sum of the capac- ity of the firm sources, such as generators and ESS in- verters. For specialty loads intended to be powered directly from a variable source, the capacity can be calculated using the sum of the variable sources, such as PV or wind inverters, or the combined capacity of both firm and variable sources. (B) Sizing and Protection. The circuit conductors be- tween a stand-alone source and a building or structure disconnecting means shall be sized based on the sum of the output ratings of the stand-alone source(s). For three-phase interconnections, the phase loads shall be controlled or balanced to be compatible with specifi- cations of the sum of the power supply capacities. (C) Single 120-Volt Supply. Stand-alone and isolated microgrid systems shall be permitted to supply 120 volts to single-phase, 3-wire, 120/240-volt service equipment or distribution panels where there are no 240-volt outlets and where there are no multiwire branch circuits. In all installations, the sum of the rat- ings of the power sources shall be less than the rating of the neutral bus in the service equipment. This equip- ment shall be marked with the following words or equivalent: WARNING: SINGLE 120-VOLT SUPPLY. DO NOT CONNECT MULTIWIRE BRANCH CIRCUITS! The warning sign(s) or label(s) shall comply with 110.21(B). N(D) Three-Phase Supply. Stand-alone and micro- grid systems shall be permitted to supply three-phase, 3-wire grounded or 4-wire grounded systems. (E) Energy Storage or Backup Power System Re- quirements. Energy storage or backup power supplies shall not be required. (F) Back-fed Circuit Breakers. Plug-in-type back- fed circuit breakers connected to an interconnected supply shall be secured in accordance with 408.36(D). Circuit breakers marked “line” and “load” shall not be backfed. (G) Voltage and Frequency Control. The stand- alone or isolated microgrid supply shall be controlled so that voltage and frequency remain within suitable limits for the connected loads.
