Summary:The joint analysis of spatial and temporal processes poses computational challenges due to the data’s high dimensionality. Furthermore, such data are commonly non-Gaussian. In this paper, we introduce a copula-based spatio-temporal model for analyzing spatio-temporal data and propose a semiparametric estimator. The proposed algorithm is computationally simple, since it models the marginal distribution and the spatio-temporal dependence separately. Instead of assuming a parametric distribution, the proposed method models the marginal distributions nonparametrically and thus oﬀers more ﬂexibility. The method also provides a convenient way to construct both point and interval predictions at new times and new locations, based on the estimated conditional quantiles. Through a simulation study and an analysis of wind speeds observed along the border between Oregon and Washington, we show that our method produces more accurate point and interval predictions for skewed data than those based on normality assumptions. Key words:Copula; Markov process; Pseudo likelihood; Spatio-temporal.AuthorManuscript 1 INTRODUCTION 1. Introduction The main challenge in processing spatio-temporal data is accurately modeling the ﬁnite- dimensional joint and conditional distributions of the spatio-temporal process. These distributions can be used to describe the spatio-temporal variability of a process, to obtain forecasts at new time points and predictions at new locations, and to provide the prediction uncertainties. The model must appropriately characterize the marginal distribution for a given location while accounting for both spatial and temporal depen- dencies, which can be computationally challenging even for time series observed at a modest number of locations. Gaussian processes are commonly used to model spatio-temporal data (Storlie et al., 2017; Ludwig et al., 2017; Datta et al., 2017). However, the Gaussianity assumption is known to be inappropriate or insuﬃcient for representing many real-world datasets. When spatio-temporal processes exhibit non-Gaussian features, a Gaussian process model may be ﬁtted to transformed data. However, direct transformations of the data cannot guarantee Gaussianity and may alter other features of the process. For example, the wind speed data studied in Section 5 have non-Gaussian distributions and remain skewed even after a power transformation (Figure 3). Wallin and Bolin (2015) and Schmidt et al. (2017) illustrated that transforming data with either a square root or a logarithm induces a link between the mean and the covariance, resulting in a non-stationary process. Therefore, transforming the data is not a desirable approach. Real data applications call for non-Gaussian models. One aim of our work is to provide temporal forecasts and spatial predictions. To make one-step-ahead forecasts, many authors have built separate models for individual sites (Gneiting et al., 2006; Patton, 2012; Kazor and Hering, 2015). Such models cannot be used for predictions at new sites. To make predictions at new locations, the most common approach is to apply a variation of kriging (Krige, 1951; Cressie and Wikle, 2011; Gr¨aler et al., 2016). Kriging is the best linear predictor; however, if the normality assumption fails, then the best predictor may be nonlinear, and thus kriging may no longer be optimal for predictions with a skewed distribution, such as the wind speed This article is protected by copyright.

(2014), Quessy et al. (2015), Schmidt et al. (2017), Kang and Song (2017). These methods are either not ﬂexible enough or computationally intensive. Spatio-temporal predictions of wind speed are particularly challenging because the best performing model may depend on the number of locations available, the spatial scale, or the frequency of temporal averaging (for example, daily averages versus monthly averages); see some relevant studies in Malmberg et al. (2005), Luo et al. (2008), and Lenzi et al. (2017). Spatio-temporal models are generally complex, and their likelihood- based inference is computationally expensive even for Gaussian process models (Smith and Wilen, 2003; Derado et al., 2010; Berrocal et al., 2012; Lindstr¨om et al., 2013; Krupskii and Genton, 2017). For the analysis of non-Gaussian spatio-temporal data, we propose a new copula-based spatio-temporal (COST) model and a semiparametric maximum pseudo-likelihood esti- mator. Copula-based estimation methods were also considered in Chen and Fan (2006), Chen et al. (2009), and R´emillard et al. (2012), but these were developed for time series data. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach has the following advan- tages. First, the COST framework creates a simpliﬁed temporal and spatial dependence structure by separating the modeling of dependence from the marginal distributions, which reduces the computational challenges. Second, instead of assuming a parametric distribution, the proposed method models the marginal distributions nonparametrically, thereby increasing the model’s ﬂexibility. Third, it is straightforward to assess the uncertainty using the COST method. By generating multivariate random draws from the conditional prediction distribution and calculating the conditional quantiles, we can use the conditional median (which is more suitable for skewed distributions) for point forecasts/predictions and then use the conditional tail quantiles to construct prediction intervals. Finally, while in theory the COST method requires a large number of locations for spatial predictions, we ﬁnd that the method performs very well even with a moderate number of irregularly spaced sites, as we demonstrate on a wind speed dataset in Section 5. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the COST model framework and the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator of the copula parameters. In Section 3, we describe how COST can be used to construct one-step-ahead forecasts and new-location predictions. We assess the ﬁnite-sample performance of the COST method through a simulation study in Section 4 and apply the proposed method to an analysis This article is protected by copyright.

Copula-based semiparametric model for spatio-temporal data 2.1 COST model Let Y (s, t) be a continuous spatio-temporal process of the location s ∈ S ⊂ R2 and time t ∈ T ⊂ N, and {Y (si, t), i = 1, . . . , d, t = 1, . . . , n} be the observed data generated from this process at d locations and n time points. For notational simplicity, we denote Yt,i = Y (si, t) and Yt = (Yt,1, . . . , Yt,d)T . We assume that the data are generated from the following copula-based spatio-temporal (COST) model. (i) First, the model assumes that the process is p-order Markovian in time, which implies that P (Yt+p ⩽ yt+p|Yt+p−1, . . . , Y1) = P (Yt+p ⩽ yt+p|Yt+p−1, . . . , Yt), that is, the probabilistic properties of the process are completely determined by the joint distribution H(yt, . . . , yt+p) = P ( Yt,1 ⩽ yt,1, . . . , Yt,d ⩽ yt,d, . . . , Yt+p,1 ⩽ yt+p,1, . . . , Yt+p,d ⩽ yt+p,d), where yt = (yt,1, . . . , yt,d)T . (ii) Second, by Sklar’s theorem (Sklar, 1959), there exists a {(p + 1)d}-dimensional copula CST such that H(yt, . . . , yt+p) = CST { F (yt,1|s1), . . . , F (yt,d|sd), . . . , F (yt+p,1|s1), . . . , F (yt+p,d|sd); Bt, θ} , (1) where F (·|s) is the marginal cumulative distribution function (CDF) for {Y (s, t), t = 1, . . .} at location s, Bt = {s1, . . . , sd} × {t, t + 1, . . . , t + p}, and θ is the copula parameter vector. For ease of presentation, we focus on p = 1 hereafter, but the proposed method can be adapted for general p with some modiﬁcation. Remark 1:The copula in the above COST model is a special case of the spatio- temporal ﬁeld copula deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1 of the Supporting Information S1.1 with D = d and N = p + 1. The copula links the marginals together to form the joint distri- bution, and it allows us to model the marginal distributions F (·|si) separately from the spatio-temporal dependence structure, which is expressed in CST (·; Bt, θ). By the COST model, data can be generated by ﬁrst generating y1, . . . , yp from CST { F (y1,1|s1), . . . , F (y1,d|sd), . . . , F (yp,1|s1), . . . , F (yp,d|sd), 1d; B1, θ} and then generating Yt+p sequentially from the con- ditional distribution Yt+p|yt, . . . , yt+p−1.

Two practical choices are the elliptic copula (R´emillard et al., 2012), including Gaussian and Student t copulas as special cases, and the v-transformed multivariate normal (VTMN) copula (B´ardossy and Li, 2008), which can capture the asymmetry in the tail dependence. For both copulas, the dependence can be speciﬁed through a correlation matrix R. Considering such copulas, we can rewrite CST (·; Bt, θ) as CST (·; R), and rewrite (1) for p = 1 as H(y1, y2) = CST {F (y1,1|s1), . . . , F (y1,d|sd), F (y2,1|s1), . . . , F (y2,d|sd); R} = Ψ2d{Ψ −1 1 (u1,1), . . . , Ψ −1 1 (u1,d), Ψ−1 1 (u2,1), . . . , Ψ −1 1 (u2,d); R}, where ut,i = F (yt,i|si), t = 1, 2, i = 1, . . . , d, and Ψ2d and Ψ1 are the joint and marginal distributions of the (2d)-dimensional distribution associated with the copula, respec- tively. In general, the marginals of Ψ2d need not be the same, but here we assume that they are for simplicity. Using the Gaussian copula as an example, Ψ2d is the joint CDF of a (2d)-dimensional normal distribution with unit variance and correlation matrix R, and Ψ1 is the CDF of N (0, 1); more details on the elliptic and VTMN copulas are given in the Supporting Information S1.2. For the copula function to appropriately capture the spatio-temporal dependence, we must specify the structure of the matrix R. In this paper, we assume second order stationarity so that the correlation between two locations only depends on the diﬀer- ence in their locations, not on the locations themselves. We adopt the non-separable spatio-temporal correlation matrix as in Gneiting (2002), which incorporates possible anisotropy in space (Zimmerman, 1993; Huser et al., 2017). To apply this to our wind speed data analysis, we let hij denote the scaled Mahalanobis distance between si and sj; that is, h 2 ij = (si − sj) T V−1(si − sj) with V = ( cos(ζ) − sin(ζ) sin(ζ) cos(ζ) ) ( 1 0 0 λ −1 ) ( cos(ζ) − sin(ζ) sin(ζ) cos(ζ) )T , where λ > 0 is the length ratio of the two principal axes, and ζ ∈ [0, π/2] is the angle with respect to the west-east direction. When λ = 1, the Mahalanobis distance degenerates to the Euclidean distance. We let X(si, t) = Ψ −1 1 [F {Y (si, t)|si}], and assume that corr{X(si, t), X(sj, t + δ)} = 1 (1 + b1|δ|2b3)b2 exp { − ch2γ ij (1 + b1|δ|2b3)b2γ } , (2) This article is protected by copyright.

The purely spatial correlation function is of the powered exponential form, and the purely temporal correlation function belongs to the Cauchy class. Since we consider Markov processes of order p = 1, we only need to consider the conditional distribution of Yt given Yt−1, that is, |δ| = 0, 1 in (2), where δ = 0 describes the variance of the process, and δ = ±1 describes the covariance between adjacent time points. Deﬁne η = (1 + b1) b2 > 1. The correlation matrix R can be written as R = ( R11 R12 R21 R22 ) , (3) where R11 = R22 = (exp(−ch 2γ ij ) )d i,j=1 , and R12 = R21 = (η−1 exp(−ch 2γ ij /ηγ) )d i,j=1. By Theorem 2 and Example 1 from Gneiting (2002), (2) is a stationary correlation function on R2 × N; that is, corr{X(s, t), X(s + h, t + δ)} only depends on h and δ (Gneiting, 2002). Consequently, the correlation matrix deﬁned in (3) is nonnegative deﬁnite. Let θ be the vector of parameters involved in the copula; for example, θ = (ζ, λ, c, γ, η) for the Gaussian copula, and θ = (ζ, λ, c, γ, η, υ) for the t copula with degrees of freedom (df) υ. Since R is determined by θ, we do not distinguish between R and θ when the context is clear. The COST framework can easily accommodate nugget eﬀects by introducing some additional parameters in the correlation matrix; see Supporting Information S2. 2.3 Properties of the COST model We present the mixing and stationary properties implied by the COST model and the condition A.1 as below. A.1 The spatio-temporal process Y (s, t) is induced by CST (·; R), where R is the corre- lation matrix deﬁned in (3). Proposition 1:Assuming that the COST model and A.1 hold, we have (i) for elliptic and VTMN copulas, with a given s, Y (s, t) is stationary and β-mixing with the decay rate β(t) = O{exp(−a1t)} for some a1 > 0; (ii) for Gaussian and VTMN copulas, with a given t, Y (s, t) is α-mixing with the mixing coeﬃcient α(k) = O(k−a2) for some a2 > 0 large enough. Supporting Information S3.1 gives the deﬁnitions of diﬀerent types of mixings, and S3.2 provides the proof of Proposition 1. This article is protected by copyright.

For the Gaussian copula, the dependence between two distant locations diminishes if the correlation decays with h. However, the spatial dependence of t-copula does not converge to zero as the distance increases (Røislien and Omre, 2006). Despite this limitation, we still consider the t copula in our numerical studies for several reasons. First, it is analytically tractable. Second, the rank correlation induced by the t copula decays with h. More speciﬁcally, the prediction at new locations/times are based on the conditional t distribution with df increasing with the number of locations, which means that locations far away from those of interest play negligible roles in the prediction, similar to standard kriging. In addition, the t copula contains the Gaussian copula as a special case but provides more ﬂexibility by leaving the df unspeciﬁed. 2.4 Semiparametric maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator of θ Let f (·|si) be the density function corresponding to F (·|si). The conditional density of Yt, given Yt−1 = yt−1 = (yt−1,1, . . . , yt−1,d) T and evaluated at yt = (yt,1, . . . , yt,d) T , is fYt|Yt−1(yt|yt−1) = cST (ut−1, ut; θ) cS(ut−1; θ) d∏ i=1 f (yt,i|si), where ut = {F (yt,1|s1), . . . , F (yt,d|sd)}T , cST (u, v; θ) = ∂2dCST (u, v; θ)/∂u∂v, cS(u; θ) = ∂dCS(u; θ)∂u, and CS(u; θ) = P (U1 ⩽ u1, . . . , Ud ⩽ ud, V1 ⩽ 1, . . . , Vd ⩽ 1; θ) = CST (u, 1d; θ) is the d-dimensional purely spatial copula. We propose a two-stage procedure for parameter estimation. In stage 1, at each lo- cation si, i = 1, . . . , d, we estimate F (·|si) by the rescaled empirical CDF ̃F (y|si) = 1 n+1 ∑n t=1 I(Yt,i ⩽ y), and get the pseudo uniform variables ˜ut = { ̃F (yt,1|s1), . . . , ̃F (yt,d|sd)}T , t = 1, . . . , n. In stage 2, we construct the pseudo likelihood based on the pseudo variables and deﬁne ̂θ = arg max θ n∑ t=2 l(˜ut−1, ˜ut; θ), (4) where l(u, v; θ) = log{cST (u, v; θ)/cS(u; θ)}. Following the copula literature (Joe, 1997; R´emillard et al., 2012), we refer to the proposed two-stage estimator ̂θ as the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator (MPLE). Under the COST model, condition A.1, and some additional regularity conditions, we can establish the consistency and asymptotic nor- mality of ̂θ as n → ∞. The additional conditions and proofs can be found in Supporting Information S3.3. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.AuthorManuscript 3 FORECASTS AND PREDICTIONS 3. Forecasts and predictions 3.1 Forecasts at future time points With the estimation ̃F (·|si), i = 1, . . . , d, and ̂θ (consequently ̂R), we can obtain a one- step-ahead forecast at time n + 1. For a ﬁrst-order Markov series, we forecast Yn+1 by generating random draws from the conditional distribution of Yn+1|Yn = yn. To simplify notation, denote F (·|si) by Fi, and ̃F (·|si) by ̃Fi. Below, we describe how to generate from the conditional distribution based on the Gaussian copula, following Algorithm 1 in Supporting Information S4.1; the computing details for the t copula can be found in Supporting Information S4.2. Deﬁne Xn = (Xn,1, . . . , Xn,d) T and ˜xn = (˜xn,1, . . . , ˜xn,d) T , where Xn,i = Φ−1{Fi(Yn,i)}, and ˜xn,i = Φ −1{ ̃Fi(yn,i)}. We let x(m) n+1 = {x(m) n+1,1, . . . , x(m) n+1,d} T , m = 1, . . . , M , be random draws from Xn+1|Xn = ˜xn ∼ N ( ̂B˜xn, ̂Ω), where ̂B = ̂R21 ̂R−1 11 , ̂Ω = ̂R22 − ̂R21 ̂R −1 11 ̂R12, then the random draws of Yn+1|Yn = yn are generated by y(m) n+1 = ( ̃F − 1 [Φ{x (m) n+1,1}], . . . , ̃F − d [Φ{x(m) n+1,d}] )T , where ̃F − i is the generalized inverse of ̃Fi. The q-th estimated quantile of Yn+1,i|Yn = yn is ̂Qq(Yn+1,i|yn) = ̃F − i [Φ { ̂RT 12,i ̂R−1 11 ̃xn + Φ−1(q) √ 1 − ̂RT 12,i ̂R−1 11 ̂R12,i}] , where ̂R12,i is the i-th column of ̂R12. Thus, at each location i, we can construct a point forecast of Yn+1 by using either the sample mean of the random draws, M −1 ∑M m=1 y(m) n+1, or the conditional median estimator, ̂Q0.5(Yn+1,i|yn), which is more suitable for skewed distributions. We can also construct a 95% forecast interval using ( ̂Q0.025(Yn+1,i|yn), ̂Q0.975(Yn+1,i|yn)). The random draws y(m) n+1 are generated as a vector from the conditional distribution of Yn+1|yn. Therefore, using the random draws for probabilistic forecasts can appropriately capture the spatial dependence of the forecasts; see numerical evidences given in Section 4.2. 3.2 Prediction at new locations Let Yt(s∗) = (Y ∗ t,1, . . . , Y ∗ t,K)T be the unknown outcomes at K new locations, denoted by s∗ = (s∗ 1, . . . , s∗ K), at time t. To construct the point and interval predictions, we generate random draws from the conditional distribution of Yt(s∗)|{Yt = yt, Yt−1 = yt−1}. We demonstrate with the Gaussian copula; computation details for the t copula are in Supporting Information S4.2. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.AuthorManuscript 4 SIMULATION STUDY Deﬁne the estimated (2d + K) × (2d + K) extended correlation matrix as ̃R = ( ̂R ̂R∗ ̂RT ∗ ̂R∗∗ ) , where ̂R∗ and ̂R∗∗ are the estimated correlation matrices of dimension 2d × K and K × K, constructed similarly as ̂R. For COST with the Gaussian copula, we have X∗ t |{Xt−1 = xt−1, Xt = xt} ∼ N ( ̂RT ∗ ̂R −1xt−1:t, ̂R∗∗ − ̂RT ∗ ̂R−1 ̂R∗), where xt−1:t = (xT t−1, xT t ) T . We denote the M random draws from the above mul- tivariate normal distribution as x∗(m) t , m = 1, . . . , M , and the random draws from Yt(s∗)|Yt = yt, Yt−1 = yt−1 as y∗(m) t = ( ̃F ∗− 1 [Φ{x ∗(m) t,1 }], . . . , ̃F ∗− K [Φ{x∗(m) t,K }] )T , where ̃F ∗ k (·) is the estimated marginal distribution of {Ys∗ k,t}, and ̃F ∗− k is the corresponding generalized inverse. Then, the point prediction of Yt(s∗) at a single time point t ⩾ 2 can be constructed by ̂E{Yt(s∗)|Yt = yt, Yt−1 = yt−1} = M −1 ∑M m=1 y∗(m) t . For an interval prediction at the new location s∗ k, we derive the q-th conditional quantile of Y ∗ t,k|{Yt = yt, Yt−1 = yt−1} as ̂Qq(Y ∗ t,k|yt, yt−1) = ̃F ∗− k [Φ { ̂RT ∗k ̂R−1xt−1:t + Φ−1(q) √ 1 − ̂RT ∗∗k ̂R−1 ̂R∗∗k}] , where ̂R∗k, ̂R∗∗k are the k-th columns of ̂R∗ and ̂R∗∗, respectively. The 95% prediction interval can be constructed by ( ̂Q0.025(Y ∗ t,k|yt, yt−1), ̂Q0.975(Y ∗ t,k|yt, yt−1)), and if the data are skewed, we can construct the point prediction using ̂Q0.5(Y ∗ t,k|yt, yt−1). To estimate F ∗ k (·) = F (·|s ∗ k), we need to use information from neighboring sites, because no data have been observed at the new locations; see estimation details and the consistency in the Supporting Information S3.4. 4. Simulation study 4.1 Simulation design and parameter estimation The data are generated from the COST model using Algorithm 1 (Supporting Informa- tion S4.1) with R11 = R22 = (exp (−c0h 2γ0 ij ))d i,j=1 , R12 = R21 = ( 1 η0 exp ( −c0h 2γ0 ij ηγ0 0 ))d i,j=1 , where hij is the Mahalanobis distance between si and sj. We consider four cases. In all cases, (c0, γ0, η0) = (1, 0.5, 1.5). In Cases 1–3, (ζ0, λ0) = (0, 1), that is, hij = ∥si − sj∥, so the true correlation structure is isotropic. In Case 4, (ζ0, λ0) = (0, 5), so the correlation This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.AuthorManuscript 4 SIMULATION STUDY 4.2 Forecasts at future time points structure is anisotropic. The copulas used for generating data in Cases 1–4 are Gaussian, t3, t10, and t3, respectively. The time series at each location has a Gamma marginal distribution, with location-dependent shape and scale parameters, α(s) = 2s1 + s2 2 and β(s) = s1 + s2, respectively, where s1, s2 are the location coordinates. For each case, we consider 1000 replicates. To mimic the wind speed data in Section 5, we assume that the data are observed at d = 9 ﬁxed locations, {s1, . . . , s9} = {(1/6, 1/6), (1/6, 3/6), (1/6, 5/6), (3/6, 1/6), (3/6, 3/6), (3/6, 5/6), (5/6, 1/6), (5/6, 3/6), (5/6, 5/6)}, and we make predictions at K = 4 new locations, {s∗ 1, . . . , s∗ 4} = {(1/3, 1/3), (1/3, 2/3), (2/3, 1/3), (2/3, 2/3)}. We set n = 2000, using a burn-in sequence of length 3000 for stationarity when generating data at d+K locations with a sequence of length n+1. We use {Yt = (Yt,1, . . . , Yt,d) T , t = 1, . . . , n} to estimate θ, and use the rest as test data for verifying the forecast of Yn+1 = (Yn+1,1, . . . , Yn+1,d) T at time t = n + 1 and prediction of Y∗ n = (Y ∗ n,1, . . . , Y ∗ n,K)T at new locations s∗ 1, . . . , s∗ K. We consider two variations of COST: COSTG and COSTt, which use the Gaussian copula and t copula with unknown df, respectively. We also include GP and logGP methods, which assume a Gaussian ﬁrst-order Markov process on the original and log-transformed data; see Supporting Information S4.3 for more details of GP. For all four methods, we assume an anisotropic correlation structure. For forecasts at future time points, we also include the copula-based semiparametric method from Chen and Fan (2006), denoted as CF, which analyzes the time series at each location separately using the t copula. Table 1 in Supporting Information S4.5 shows that COSTt is more ﬂexible, and it in general gives similar or more eﬃcient estimation of correlation parameters than COSTG. 4.2 Forecasts at future time points We consider the following metrics to assess the forecasting performance of diﬀerent methods at time t = n+1: (i) the mean squared error of the estimator of E(Yn+1,j|Yn) . = µj, that is, E(ˆµj − µj)2 for j = 1, . . . , 9; (ii) the empirical coverage percentages (ECPs) and mean lengths (MLs) of 95% forecast intervals; and (iii) the multivariate rank. Let y(0) n+1,j be the observed response at time n + 1 and location sj. The multivariate rank is an assessment tool for probabilistic forecasts of vector-valued quantities (Gneiting et al., 2008). Here it measures the rank of yn+1 = (y(0) n+1,1, . . . , y(0) n+1,d) T , the observed verifying vector at time n + 1 among the M random draw from Yn+1|Yn = yn; see Supporting Information S4.4 for the deﬁnition of multivariate rank. If the probabilistic forecasts ensemble the verifying vectors well, the multivariate rank follows a uniform distribution. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.AuthorManuscript 4.3 Predictions at new locations 4 SIMULATION STUDY In Sections 4.2 and 4.3, we report the MSE of the estimated conditional mean instead of the mean forecast errors, E{ˆµj − y(0) n+1,j}2, because we ﬁnd that the mean forecast errors are almost always dominated by the conditional variance of Yn+1|Yn. Figure 1 shows that the GP and logGP methods give worse estimation than COSTt, likely due to their misspeciﬁed distributions. COSTG performs almost the same as COSTt in Case 1, but it is less eﬃcient when the data are generated from the t copula in Cases 2–3. Taking spatial information into account clearly improves the eﬃciency of COSTt over its location-speciﬁc counterpart method CF. The prediction intervals from all methods have coverage close to the nominal level. However, COSTt produces shorter intervals than the other methods except in Case 1, where COSTG, COSTt, and CF perform similarly. [Figure 1 about here.] Figure 2 presents histograms of the multivariate ranks across 1000 replicates for Case 1; results for Cases 2-4 are in Figure 1 of Supporting Information S4.5. The histograms of the multivariate ranks from the COSTG and COSTt forecasts have nearly uniform distributions, indicating that the random draws from the proposed predictive distribu- tion ensemble the verifying vectors well, even when the copula function is misspeciﬁed. The histograms for the CF ranks are far from uniform, as the forecasts are obtained by analyzing each location separately and thus fail to capture the spatial dependence. The GP and logGP histograms also show clear deviation from uniform, reﬂecting the bias in ensembles obtained from Gaussian/log-Gaussian processes for non-normal data. In practice, it can be diﬃcult to ﬁnd a unique transformation to make data from all locations normal due to the non-stationarity, making it impossible to predict at new locations. [Figure 2 about here.] 4.3 Predictions at new locations To estimate the marginal distribution at a new location, we consider the kernel-type estimator with m0 = 4 nearest neighbors, corresponding to setting h1 = √2/6, for all four new locations; the kernel-type estimator can be found in Supporting Information S3.4. For the GP method, we estimate the mean and variance at a new location by averaging the sample means and variances of the four nearest neighbors. We do not include kriging predictions because kriging captures the prediction uncertainty based on the kriging variance, which is only a function of measurement density and spatial conﬁguration of data points, while in COST, uncertainty estimation at the unsampled This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.AuthorManuscript 5 ANALYSIS OF THE HOURLY WIND SPEED DATA location is based on the full conditional distribution calculated as a conditional copula (Li et al., 2011). Furthermore, in our numerical analysis, the number of locations is small, so accurately characterizing the spatial dependence structure needed for kriging will be diﬃcult, and with the large number of time points, space-time kriging is computationally infeasible. Table 1 presents the ECP and ML of the 95% prediction intervals from the COSTt, GP, and logGP methods at four new locations. The prediction intervals from all methods have coverage close to the nominal level. However, the intervals from COSTt are consistently shorter than those from GP and logGP. This, together with ﬁndings in Section 4.2, suggests that the proposed semiparametric method gives more accurate predictions and is more suitable for analyzing non-normal, spatio-temporal data than Gaussian-based methods. [Table 1 about here.] 5. Analysis of the hourly wind speed data The data contain the average hourly wind speeds recorded from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 at twenty meteorological towers along the border between Oregon and Washington state, a region with large wind-energy resources. The data are maintained and archived by the Bonneville Power Administration and were presented previously in Kazor and Hering (2015). To minimize the imputation required to compensate for missing data, we focus on ten sites that have less than 3.5% missing data during each of the three years. The missing values were imputed using multiple linear regression of the wind speed on neighboring horizontal and vertical wind components. The dataset contains 26,304 hourly observations for each site. First, we perform some preprocessing. We transfer the latitude and longitude of the ten sites into a Cartesian coordinate system, assigning the Hood River, OR, site as the origin with 100-kilometer axes. Our preliminary analysis at each site showed that the wind speed distribution is highly non-normal; see Figure 3 for an example. Applying the log transformation aligns the distribution most closely with normality, but it still diﬀers. We apply COSTG and COSTt methods to the untransformed wind speed data, but apply the GP approach to the log-transformed data (denoted as logGP). Following the de-trending method in Zhu et al. (2014), we model and remove the diurnal trend with the average hourly wind speed in a rolling window so the detrended data can be treated as mean-zero processes.

All rights reserved.AuthorManuscript 5 ANALYSIS OF THE HOURLY WIND SPEED DATA [Figure 3 about here.] We ﬁnd that the ﬁrst-order partial correlation of the time series at each location is around 0.9, and the largest second-order partial correlation is smaller than 0.2. Therefore, for computational convenience, we assume a ﬁrst-order Markov process when ﬁtting the data for the COSTG, COSTt and logGP methods. For the one-hour-ahead forecasts, we also include the CF method, which is the separate time series analysis method of Chen and Fan (2006). For all methods, we update the parameter estimation progressively in a rolling-window format: we incorporate the year 2014 data as it becomes available, with a window length of 90 days, resulting in data vectors featuring n=2,160 time points, and update the parameters in each method every 24 hours. For COSTt, the estimated df ranges from 15.9 to 28.7, with mean 21.3 and standard deviation 3.0. For short-term wind speed forecasting, Kazor and Hering (2015) proposed a regime- switching (RS) forecasting method, where the regimes are identiﬁed by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Within each regime, a multiple regression model is built with variables selected from among four lags for wind speed, and three lags for the cosine and sine of the wind direction across multiple locations. Compared to our proposed model that relies on only one regime and one lag for wind speed, the RS model is much more complex and data adaptive; thus, it provides excellent results for one-hour-ahead forecasts. Therefore, we use the forecast results from the RS method as a gold standard, where the median of the predictive distribution from the chosen regime is used for point forecasts. Table 2 summarizes the mean absolute error (MAE) of diﬀerent methods for one-hour- ahead point forecasts, based on hourly averages from year 2014, and the ECP and ML of the 95% prediction intervals. In terms of point forecasting, COSTG, COSTt and CF methods all perform comparably to the RS method and better than logGP, and COSTt is slightly better than COSTG. The forecast intervals from all four methods have coverage probabilities close to 95%, but those from logGP are generally wider. The multivariate rank histograms in Figure 4 indicate that the ensembles generated from both COSTG and COSTt capture the features of the observed spatio-temporal data well, but those from logGP and CF are either biased due to the violation of normality or failure to capture the spatial dependence. [Table 2 about here.] [Figure 4 about here.] We now assess prediction performance at the Hood River testing site. The RS and CF This article is protected by copyright.

In terms of point prediction, the MAE of the logGP predictions is slightly smaller than COSTG and COSTt. However, the prediction intervals from logGP have much lower coverage proba- bilities and larger widths (ECP=73.8%, ML=15.39) than those of COSTG (ECP=94.8%, ML=14.83) and COSTt (ECP=94.9%, ML=14.48). The prediction intervals from COSTt are slightly narrower than those from COSTG. 6. Discussion In our numerical studies, we considered Gaussian and t copulas, which are tail-symmetric copulas. The dependence in some studies may be asymmetric in the upper and lower tails. To increase the modeling ﬂexibility, our future research may draw on ideas from spatial models developed to handle tail asymmetry, namely the factor copula models (Hua et al., 2017; Krupskii et al., 2018), vine models (Erhardt et al., 2015), and Tukey g-and- h random ﬁelds (Xu and Genton, 2017). Another alternative is to adopt asymmetric copulas in our proposed procedure, for instance, the skewed t-copula considered in Yoshiba (2018), which is a useful extension of the t copula. Extending these methods to analyze spatio-temporal data and conduct probabilistic predictions require further investigation both numerically and theoretically.
