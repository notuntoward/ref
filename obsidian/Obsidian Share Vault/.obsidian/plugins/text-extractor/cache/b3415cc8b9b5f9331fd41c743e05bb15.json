As such during periods of lightning activity, AEMO will reclassify a 3 phase fault on this line as a credible contingency. Based on the advice from Powerlink, Woree - Tumoulin No.877 275 kV and Chalumbin - Turkinje No.7166 132 kV is considered at risk of a 3 phase fault when lightning is in the vicinity. While each transmission line is on a separate tower, they have “shared” earthing (underground and aerial) at various locations in the shared easement. As such during periods of lightning activity, AEMO will reclassify a 3 phase fault on these lines as a credible contingency. Notes Region Double Circuit Transmission Lines LTTW –– End date for Probable state LTTW –– End date for Proven state Reason for Classification Based on the advice from Transgrid, the 8C line is considered at risk of a two-phase to earth fault and the 8E line is considered at risk of a single-phase to earth fault when lightning is in the vicinity. As such during periods of lightning activity, AEMO will reclassify a two-phase to earth fault on 8C and single-phase to earth fault on 8E as a credible contingency. Based on advice from Powerlink, Middle Ridge no.2 and no.3 275/110 kV transformers are at risk of tripping simultaneously when lightning is in the vicinity. As such during periods of lightning activity, AEMO will reclassify the trip of both transformers as a credible contingency.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
