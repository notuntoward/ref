Let's delve into the details: 1. Supply Curve: o The supply curve represents the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity supplied by producers. It typically slopes upward, indicating that as the price increases, suppliers are willing to produce and sell more of the product. o In other words, higher prices incentivize producers to increase their output, leading to a positive correlation between price and quantity supplied. 2. Inverse Supply Curve: o Now, let's consider the inverse supply curve. Unlike the regular supply curve, the inverse supply curve is upward sloping. o The term “inverse” here refers to the inverse relationship between price and quantity supplied. Specifically: = As the price of a product increases, the quantity supplied by producers also increases. = Conversely, when the price decreases, the quantity supplied decreases as well. o Essentially, the inverse supply curve shows how producers respond to changes in price, with higher prices leading to greater production. In summary, the inverse supply curve is a graphical representation that highlights the positive correlation between price and quantity supplied in electricity markets, but it is presented in an “inverse” manner compared to the traditional supply curve1/(2/(3 .
