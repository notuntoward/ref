Dionne Jr. The lessons in progressives’ hidden 2024 victories \u0000e Republican pivot away from abortion and same-sex marriage reminds liberals they can win. November 24, 2024 5 min 1379 Supporters of reproductive rights have won the national debate on abortion, even if it might not feel that way to them. One side can know it has prevailed in an argument when many on the other side simply stop making their case. This is the story of abortion in the 2024 campaign — and of same-sex marriage, too. Republicans were once eager to assail Democrats on both issues. Now they have traded them in, banging away instead on immigration and against transgender rights. This was a shrewd political move, but it also reflects how far social liberalism has advanced. After gyrating from one position to another, Donald Trump simply gave up on being a pro-life candidate. The states, he said, would settle the issue, and he didn’t give a damn how they did it. The Republican Party followed along, drastically weakening the antiabortion provisions in its platform because it recognized that opposing reproductive rights after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision was an electoral loser. And it is. Abortion rights prevailed in 7 out of 10 states where voters had a choice this year — in three carried by Vice President Kamala Harris (New York, Maryland and Colorado) but also in four won by Trump (Missouri, Arizona, Montana and Nevada). Reproductive rights won 57 percent of the vote in pro-Trump Florida, but the state had a 60 percent threshold for the referendum to pass. Opponents of abortion rights fully prevailed only in Nebraska and South Dakota. Whereas Trump’s apostasy on abortion was out in the open, it was barely noticed that the GOP platform also dropped its opposition to same-sex marriage — because roughly 7 in 10 Americans now support it. The right turned to highlighting transgender issues precisely because there is now broad support for so much of the rest of the LGBTQ+ rights agenda. Yes, the GOP succeeded in using the transgender issue to paint Harris as the “they/them” candidate. But on so many questions, the broad liberalizing trends of the past three decades are alive and well, and understanding how far progressive positions have advanced is central to recognizing that Trump’s narrow victory did not represent a sharp movement to the right akin to Ronald Reagan’s 1980 triumph. Trump’s combined margin in the decisive swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin was, as of Friday’s tallies, just around 231,000. That number does not justify apocalyptic electoral analysis. Of course, reproductive rights activists don’t feel like winners. Even after Missouri’s vote, 12 states, including populous Texas, still have broad abortion bans, and four more, including Florida, have bans after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. In conservative states, Republicans will continue to push restrictions, including new barriers to medication abortions. Democrats and abortion rights advocates were also disappointed that the issue was not powerful enough to elect Harris, and exit polling suggests why. Trump’s victory was powered primarily by two issues: 32 percent of voters told pollsters the economy was key to their choice, and they backed Trump 80 percent to 19 percent. Another 11 percent picked immigration, and these voters were overwhelmingly pro-Trump, 90 percent to 9 percent. On Harris’s side, the state of democracy was selected by 34 percent of voters, and they backed her 80 percent to 18 percent. On abortion, chosen by 14 percent, voters backed Harris 74 percent to 25 percent. Notice the disparity: Immigration — Trump’s big social issue — worked better for him than abortion worked for Harris. Trump carried immigration voters by 81 points. Harris’s lead among abortion voters was 49 points. Trump cut Harris’s advantage not only because the issue still matters to a share of the antiabortion minority but also because he shifted the attention of social conservatives to immigration and trans issues. How was this so effective? Immigration is a staple issue for far-right voters across Western democracies because it speaks to the unease many of them, particularly the economically stressed, feel over what they see as the costs of social, cultural and demographic change. This is why Robert P. Jones, president of the Public Religion Research Institute and with whom I’ve worked on surveys over the years, sees immigration and ethno-nationalist impulses surpassing older moral agendas as priorities for many Christian conservatives. Trans rights similarly challenge traditionalist voters who feel buffeted by liberalizing norms, as reflected in the victories social liberals have won. And one fact makes trans issues a harder reach for many Americans compared with same-sex marriage: Many more Americans know someone who is gay or lesbian than someone who is openly trans. That makes the road forward more difficult, but then few anticipated the speed of the transformation that has already occurred. Being mindful of the largely hidden liberal victories of 2024 does not mean downplaying the challenges Democrats face — or the dangers Trump’s genuinely radical agenda presents. But to acknowledge the gains is to see that the country Trump will lead is neither as supportive of his agenda as he claims nor as allergic to progressive change as many of his adversaries fear. One defeat, however stunning, does not discredit the value of persuasion and coalition- building. They take time. They still work.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
