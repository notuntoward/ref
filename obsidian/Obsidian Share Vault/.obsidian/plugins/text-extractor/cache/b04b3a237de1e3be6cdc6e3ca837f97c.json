Sustainability 2024, 16, 1166 3 of 37 2. Methodology According to Sanjay [19], a systematic literature review is conducted in four stages. This section will therefore discuss the steps followed to gather and analyze the litera- ture on the use of GAI to enhance employee productivity in the modern workplace, as explained below: • Literature retrieval—The first and most important step in the data collecting process, this step comprises selecting acceptable search keywords and key phrases to thor- oughly gather relevant articles relating to the targeted topic. Pre-existing papers and publications in several areas of employee competency development were collected from the Scopus database. The above process was carried out using a list of keywords, such as “productivity”, “Conversational AI”, “employees”, “Chatbot”, “Generative Artificial Intelligence”, “efficiency”, “workers”, “ChatGPT”, and “GAI”. Thus, authors were able to conduct more targeted research across titles, keywords, and abstracts as a result of these phrase combinations. Over the years 1989 to September 2023, the main data-gathering method resulted in the inclusion of 683 research publications. • Literature screening—The PRISMA statement, a well-known and stringent technique for performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses, affected the literature screening procedure in this investigation as indicated in Figure 1. This technique provides an organized structure for ensuring the systematic identification, selection, and evalu- ation of the relevant literature, hence improving the review process’s accuracy and repeatability [19]. Initially, 683 papers were collected for this study. After removing duplicates, 646 papers remained. Further rigorous review to align with the research scope reduced this to 159 relevant reviews, articles, and publications from 2014 to September 2023. Figure 2 visually illustrates the increase in the number of publications related to the topic over this period, and the chronological chart highlights a surge in publications, particularly in 2023. This trend, showing a rapid increase since 2014, correlates with the rise of advanced GAI tools like ChatGPT. This research reflects the recognition of AI’s potential to enhance professional performance, leading to heightened awareness among business leaders, managers, and government agencies about the benefits of integrating AI into their operational activities and organizational frameworks. • Content analysis—The content analysis process involved a thorough examination and organization of a large body of material, particularly research journals, to identify recurring themes and patterns. This study’s focus was on exploring how GAI enhances staff efficiency, categorizing articles into distinct categories and sub-fields. This sys- tematic classification provided a comprehensive understanding of GAI’s multifaceted impact within organizations, facilitating the extraction of significant findings and insights from the data. • Bibliometric analysis—The bibliometric analysis in this study systematically examined the academic literature, focusing on citations and references within articles. Its goal was to enhance understanding of the impact, trends, and connections in academia. By analyzing citation patterns, co-authorship, and keywords, it identified key authors, pivotal publications, emerging research areas, and collaborative networks. The subsequent sections will therefore methodically carry out both content and biblio- metric analyses, adhering closely to the previously outlined methodologies. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the research. Sustainability 2024, 16, 1166 4 of 37Sustainability 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 40 Figure 1.

However, scholarly exchange in this area requires concerted efforts to enhance authors’ collaboration and expand the application of GAI in these areas of study. It is important to acknowledge a notable gap in our literature review concerning the application of GAI in the finance industry. While our review predominantly focused on employee productivity across various sectors, the specific intersection of GAI with financial services has emerged as a burgeoning area of interest. For instance, the study by Dowling and Lucey [143] explores the potential of ChatGPT in finance research, underscoring its utility in idea generation and data identification, while also highlighting limitations in literature synthesis and developing testing frameworks. Additionally, the work of Ali and Aysan [144], published after our search deadline, delves into the diverse applications of ChatGPT in finance, ranging from customer engagement to stock forecasting. These studies indicate a growing recognition of GAI’s potential within the financial sector and propose an expanding research horizon. Future research endeavors are likely to fill this gap, shedding more light on the multifaceted implications and uses of GAI technologies in the financial domain. In exploring future research directions for the enhancement of employee productivity through GAI, a range of critical areas has been identified. These encompass various sectors and require in-depth investigation to fully leverage GAI’s potential in boosting workplace efficiency and innovation. In the field of professional development in education, there is a need for comprehensive research into the necessary skills and competencies for educators and researchers to integrate GAI. This includes evaluating current training programs and proposing innovative models that blend technical skills with pedagogical methods. The issue of AI bias and discrimination calls for the development of methodological approaches aimed at reducing biases in GAI applications, potentially through interdisciplinary research that combines AI technology with insights from social sciences. The field of quality assur- ance and evaluation models in GAI requires expansion, particularly in integrating Machine Learning techniques. Research should explore the applicability of GAI across diverse sec- Sustainability 2024, 16, 1166 31 of 37 tors, extending beyond employee performance metrics. Data privacy and security in GAI applications is another critical area. Research should focus on the latest advancements in encryption and data security, considering their impact on user trust and regulatory compli- ance. Enhancing user experience in GAI applications is essential, with a focus on linguistic and cultural adaptability. Research should delve into user interface designs that are inclu- sive and appealing to a diverse user base. Addressing the technology access gap, especially in rural areas, is vital. This involves developing strategies for infrastructure improvement, policy interventions, and community-based approaches to ensure widespread technology access and adoption. In healthcare, GAI holds transformative potential. Future research should pinpoint specific areas, like predictive analytics for patient care and administrative process optimization, where GAI can make significant contributions. Legal and regulatory frameworks related to GAI call for focused research, especially in developing international standards and exploring liability issues. Interdisciplinary collaboration is key to the devel- opment of GAI. Research should emphasize the importance of cross-sector collaboration and investigate potential models and their outcomes. Finally, ethical considerations in professional sectors regarding GAI use need expansion. This includes proposing ethical frameworks and guidelines and discussing the long-term societal implications of GAI. This extensive literature review on GAI is a comprehensive exploration of its applica- tions in a variety of sectors, providing a nuanced understanding of its role in enhancing productivity. By examining GAI’s usage in different professional environments, this work offers valuable insights for future researchers and practitioners. It serves as a crucial re- source for identifying emerging trends, understanding current challenges, and discovering potential opportunities for innovation in GAI. Furthermore, this review underscores the importance of strategic implementation and continuous assessment of GAI technologies, guiding future endeavors to optimize their utility in diverse professional environments. The synthesis of these findings provides a roadmap for future research and practical appli- cations, highlighting areas where GAI can be leveraged for significant improvements in productivity and efficiency. In concluding this review paper on enhancing work productivity through GAI, the rapidly evolving nature of this field is recognized. The categories and statistics presented in this study reflect the current state of research but are likely to undergo significant changes as the field advances. Therefore, this work serves as a foundational reference for ongoing research, with the understanding that future developments will bring new perspectives to these findings.
