I am retiring at the end of this month and we are in the process of hiring a new Cascade PBS news editor. I don’t know who will take over writing this newsletter. As my boss likes to remind me: That’s not my problem. You’ll find out in January. I hope you’ll stay tuned. I won’t be leaving journalism entirely, but I plan to slow down considerably after about 45 years in the business. I will keep working on a few projects I am passionate about, including voter (and non-voter) education. Eight years ago, after the 2016 election, I wrote a column for The Seattle Times – my previous employer – expressing dismay about the lack of political enthusiasm among millennials. I threw out some math as proof that we could partly blame that generation for the surprising outcome in the presidential race. 12/16/24, 6:24 PM B ye for now, and tell your kids to vote chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 1/8 Eight years later, young people still aren't voting. (Illustration by Valerie Niemeyer) I’ve learned a lot more about politics during my five years as news editor at Crosscut and Cascade PBS, but once again, in 2024, I am disappointed in young voters, this time mostly Gen Z, for failing to vote, although they were not the only people to sit this one out. But this time, I’m not blaming them for their apparent lack of political enthusiasm. I’m blaming myself, other journalists, parents, teachers and every other member of the older generations in the room. We are failing to explain why voting is essential and impactful and a privilege. Voting shouldn’t be something you choose to do only when you feel inspired, like young voters felt, understandably, when President Barack Obama was elected. Voting is a muscle you need to build every year. You should think about what kind of people you want leading your community, your state and your country. The comments I read online and heard via parents and grandparents about why some young people skipped this election reminded me – painfully so – of my daughter’s approach to high school. When she liked the teacher, even when the subject was challenging like physics, she would earn an A. When she disliked a teacher, or felt they disliked her, the grade was more likely to be a B even if she was intellectually capable of an A in the course. I cringed when I heard people say they couldn’t vote for Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump because they didn’t like either of them. 12/16/24, 6:24 PM B ye for now, and tell your kids to vote chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/8 Excuse me? When was being likeable a qualification to run the most powerful country in the world? Very few of us will ever have an opportunity to say two words to whoever is living in the White House and we certainly won’t be inviting them over for dinner. Likability should not be the metric for evaluating political candidates. (Illustration by Valerie Niemeyer) A short aside, in case she is reading this: My 30-year-old daughter earns an A-plus in voting. I think she has voted in every regular election since she turned 18. I know this in part because, as I’ve shared previously, we live in the same city and my family has developed a ritual around voting in pubs. I think the real problems are a lack of understanding of our political process, too little attention to reputable news sources and few places to ask basic questions, like “What does the U.S. Department of Education do?” and “What is a tariff?” I know many readers of this newsletter could easily answer those questions. But I doubt that is true for the general population, especially those who depend primarily on social media for their news. My post-retirement project is what I’m calling “civics for adults.” If you’re curious or want to help, please follow me on Substack, Instagram or TikTok, where I will be launching in January. 12/16/24, 6:24 PM B ye for now, and tell your kids to vote chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 3/8 Donna Blankinship News Editor The Basics The 2024 election by the numbers Now that the election has been certified, pollster Stuart Elway has some data analysis to share. Overall, Democrats strengthened their control over state government, even as they got fewer votes than last time. Voter turnout was five points lower this year (79%) than in 2020 (84%) but the same as in 2016 (79%). Last December, asked how they would vote, respondents to our Cascade PBS/Elway Poll gave a 19-point advantage to the Democrats (53%-34%). The gap was not that wide in November. The average vote for candidates in the state was 56% for the Democrat and 42% for the Republican. Call it a lighter shade of dark blue. Here’s more of what we learned: Trump’s popularity in Washington hasn’t changed since 2016. Trump got essentially the same proportion of the vote here in each of his three elections: He lost 54%-38% to Hillary Clinton in 2016; 58%-39% to Joe Biden in 2020; and 57%-39% to Kamala Harris this year. Trump’s votes were only slightly lower than the proportions won by Mitt Romney in 2012 (41%) or John McCain in 2008 (40%). In actual votes, Trump gained ground vs. the Democrat compared to 2020, but he did so by losing fewer votes than Harris. Trump received 53,728 fewer Washington votes than he got in 2020, but Harris got 123,763 fewer votes than Biden in 2020. So, a net gain of 70,035 votes for Trump vs. the Democratic candidate. Trump changed the geography but not the outcome of Washington voting patterns. In 2016, eight counties, seven of them in southwest Washington, switched from voting for the Democrat in 2008 (and in many years before that) to the Republican – shredding the old “Cascade Curtain” model. 12/16/24, 6:24 PM B ye for now, and tell your kids to vote chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 4/8 The Elephant in the Room: Episode 2 by Sara Bernard & Maleeha Syed Follow the team as they head to Bellevue for a Republican election night watch party.

Listen now Young WA councilmembers provide a ‘generational voice’ in politics by Nate Sanford From housing struggles to public transit and climate change, politicians under 30 aim to be the change they weren’t seeing in local governments. Read more Since 2016, only Clallam County has flipped back to blue. No county has switched sides since 2020. Trump carried the same 26 counties in 2024 that he won in 2020, one less than in 2016. Democrats won every statewide race, but every other Republican on the statewide ballot outperformed Trump. The pattern was remarkably similar across the races. The average for the eight state executive offices was 56% to 44% in favor of the Democrat, exactly the same as in 2020, and nearly the same as the 55% to 45% average in 2016. The top Democratic vote-getters this year were U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell and Secretary of State Steve Hobbs with 59% each. The only Republican to top 44% was Jamie Herrera Beutler in the Lands Commissioner race, with 47%. Votes for the state House show that Democrats’ advantage in the Legislature has held relatively steady. Votes for the state House provide a more expansive view of state voting trends. Totaling all the votes across the state for the House showed a familiar 11-point advantage for the Democrats (54% to 43%). The Democrats lost some ground in the total vote but gained a seat each in the House and Senate.
