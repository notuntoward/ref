Salles Kobilanski, Vanderbilt University Elizabeth J. Zechmeister, Vanderbilt University Using an original database of legislative and presidential electoral results from the democratic transitions of the 1970s and 1980s to the present day, we provide a new assessment of electoral volatility in Latin America. Following a model established in studies of other regions, we decompose volatility into two subtypes: party replacement and stable party volatility. We demonstrate the relevance of this approach to Latin America and, further, document that volatility has persisted rather than waned in Latin America’s posttransition period largely because of party replacement. We then examine the contested link between economic performance and volatility and document temporal instability in this relationship: our analysis afﬁrms previous conclusions regarding a connection in the 1980s in Latin America but uncovers scant evidence of a relationship between the economy and volatility for the 1990s to present day. F our decades into democracy’s third wave, many Latin American political systems continue to experience in- stitutional conﬂicts and the weakening or collapse of parties (Helmke 2010, 2017; Lupu 2014; Morgan 2011; Rob- erts 2003; Seawright 2012). Instability matters because it undermines citizens’ ability to navigate programmatic poli- tics (Carlin, Singer, and Zechmeister 2015) and motivates elites to secure positions and experiment with unanticipated appeals (Helmke 2017; Lupu and Riedl 2013; Stokes 2001). We use new data to assess of one form of instability: electoral volatility. First, we present an original, comprehensive database of vote shares for Latin America: the Latin American Presi- dential and Legislative Elections (LAPALE) database (http:// www.lapaledata.com). LAPALE establishes source documen- tation, draws from ofﬁcial sources, runs from democratic tran- sitions in the 1970s/80s to 2016, and facilitates tests of ro- bustness to older data sets (e.g., Nohlen 2005) and to varying party inclusion thresholds. Second, we demonstrate the rele- vance to Latin America of a framework that assesses volatility in terms of party replacement and established party subtypes (Birch 2003; Powell and Tucker 2014). Further, and contrary to views of consolidation in Eastern Europe and Africa (Powell and Tucker 2014; Weghorst and Bernhard 2014), we show that electoral volatility still is not diminishing in Latin America, and we identify that this is largely due to persistent party re- placement. Third, we provide a new perspective on the debate about the relevance of the economy to volatility. Remmer’s (1991) classic work shows that, in the 1980s, poor economic per- formance increased electoral volatility in Latin America. Re- cently, Powell and Tucker (2014) sparked fresh debate on the relevance of economic indicators to electoral volatility (Crab- tree and Golder 2016, 2017; Powell and Tucker 2014, 2017; see also Dassonneville and Hooghe 2016). We document a relationship between economic performance and volatility for the 1980s, as per Remmer (1991); however, we ﬁnd no evidence that this link persists. In short, we show that the Mollie J.

ELECTORAL VOLATILITY AND ITS (CONTESTED) ECONOMIC UNDERPINNINGS Since Przeworski (1975) and Pedersen (1979), scholars have been assessing, reﬂecting on, and debating measures, causes, and consequences of electoral volatility. Volatility in West- ern Europe has increased over time (Dalton and Wattenberg 2000; Dassonneville and Hooghe 2016), while African and Eastern European systems have been stabilizing (Powell and Tucker 2014; Weghorst and Bernhard 2014). One perspec- tive is that volatility decreases over time in posttransition regions. Latin America appears to be an exception (Concha Olivares 2014; Lupu and Stokes 2010): high volatility (Rob- erts 2014) seems to persist amid parties and systems splin- tering or collapsing (Lupu 2014; Morgan 2011). Understanding volatility is important because where in- stability reigns, political elites are prone to make unantici- pated moves (Lupu and Riedl 2013; Stokes 2001; Tavits 2008). Such outcomes reﬂect and feed a vicious dynamic in which instability creates conditions that are ripe for out-of- program maneuvers by elites who diminish party brands and thus undercut the public’s capacity to use programmatic shortcuts and dampen party loyalties, all of which fuels fur- ther electoral instability (Carlin et al. 2015; Lupu 2016; Mor- gan 2011; Zechmeister and Corral 2013). While some vote ﬂuctuation is healthy, too much suggests de-alignment or underinstitutionalization (Dalton and Wattenberg 2000; Mainwaring and Pérez-Liñan 2015). Electoral volatility theoretically is inﬂuenced by retro- spective calculations. Economic downturns lead voters to- ward anti-incumbent preferences (Benton 2005; Fiorina 1981; Murillo and Visconti 2016; Roberts 2014; Roberts and Wib- bels 1999). Yet, the effect of the economy on volatility is sub- ject to debate. Powell and Tucker (2014) argue that Eastern European economic downturns increase volatility, but Crab- tree and Golder (2017) challenge the robustness of this ﬁnding to the exclusion of an outlying case (in response, see Powell and Tucker 2017). Weghorst and Bernhard (2014) identify a connection between economic performance and electoral vol- atility in Africa. Remmer’s (1991) oft-cited work documents a relationship between economic downturns and volatility in Latin American in the 1980s (see also Roberts and Wibbels 1999). Yet, Roberts (2014) suggests that this could be contin- gent on parties’ capacity to weather backlash against poor output. In sum, the link between the economy and volatility is contested. DATA AND MEASURES While electoral volatility has been examined in Latin Amer- ica, the ﬁeld has lacked a comprehensive data set for the years since the transitions of the 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant number of analyses use the classic Pedersen Index measure of total electoral volatility, which lumps together all types of interparty volatility in the system.1 We collected original vote-share data from ofﬁcial electoral management bodies (EMBs) across 18 Latin American countries, from democratic transitions to current times. Much existing schol- arship on electoral volatility in the region draws heavily on Nohlen’s (2005) data set (see the appendix, available online). With a commitment to replication, we worked to conﬁrm (or reﬁne, when needed) his database and extend it through 2016. When possible, we collected ofﬁcial data from coun- tries’ EMBs. Otherwise, we supplemented our data set with alternative data (see table A1; tables A1–A6 are available in the online appendix). We ﬁnd substantial congruence between ofﬁcial vote share data and Nohlen’s (2005) data set. Correlations for key mea- sures between Nohlen’s database and our own for the time period in which there is overlap (1978–2005) range from .80 to .95, which veriﬁes the general accuracy of Nohlen’s data (see the appendix). At the same time, the LAPALE database extends beyond previous data sets on electoral outcomes in the source documentation it contains, in transparency, in ﬂex- ibility regarding decisions on thresholds for party inclusion, and in terms of the time period it covers. Following recent work that distinguishes volatility at- tributable to the entry of new parties or exit of established options from that caused by shifts in vote shares among es- tablished parties (Birch 2003; Powell and Tucker 2014; Sikk 2005; Weghorst and Bernhard 2014), we used the LAPALE database to deconstruct total volatility into these constituent parts. The approach keeps total volatility in the picture, while isolating ﬂux in the menu of political options due to new parties forming and competing with varying degrees of suc- cess and duration and old parties splintering or exiting. We produced three measures of volatility for legislative and presidential elections. First, Party Replacement Volatility measures shifts in vote shares among parties that newly en- 1. Exceptions include Coppedge (1998), who measures average (ideo- logical) block volatility but does not address differences across new and es- tablished parties; Mainwaring, España-Nájera, and Gervasoni (2016), who break the Pedersen Index into within-system and extra-system volatility, which requires considerable conceptual clarity and copious case knowledge (Hug 2001, 79–80); Su (2014), who focuses on volatility within political parties (vs. systems); and Carreras, Morgenstern, and Su (2015), who account for transfers from old to new parties but focus on the two largest parties. 000 / Electoral Volatility in Latin America Mollie J.

Each measure theoretically ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no change in vote shares over time, and 1 mean- ing that all votes were distributed across different parties at time t versus time t 2 1. In considering whether to calculate values using vote shares for all parties or only those electoral options that reach a particular threshold, we assessed four decisions: no threshold, and thresholds of 2%, 5%, and 7% of all valid votes cast; we present results for analyses with no threshold and a 7% threshold.3 Following studies that identify economic performance as a predictor of volatility (e.g., Remmer 1991; Roberts and Wib- bels 1999), we also assess three measures of economic devel- opment: DGDP, Inﬂation,and Exchange Rate data for the year before each election in the database. For the latter two, we calculated the natural log of inﬂationand theexchangerateto account for very large values. 4 ELECTORAL VOLATILITY PERSISTS IN LATIN AMERICA, DRIVEN BY PARTY REPLACEMENT Total electoral volatility in Latin America increased sharply between the 1980s and 1990s, at which point presidential volatility leveled off, while legislative volatility continued to increase but at a lower rate. This afﬁrms the persistence of a trend noted by Roberts (2014) and runs counter to those concluding that third-wave democracies trend toward lower volatility and more consolidation. We add further insight by demonstrating that party replacement is the principal driver of this persistent electoral volatility. Figure 1 displays summary statistics for the two subtypes of volatility. Dark-gray boxes represent observed values for Party Replacement Volatility, and light-gray boxes represent Stable Party Volatility. Each box shows the 25th–75th per- centile observations, and the horizontal line within each box represents median volatility for each decade. Whiskers rep- resent the highest and lowest observations in an approxi- mately normal distribution; dots signify outlying observa- tions. As shown, Party Replacement Volatility has increased over time in Latin America, while Stable Party Volatility has remained more level, especially from the 1990s to the present day. Party Replacement Volatility across legislative elections trended upward from the 1980s to the 2000s, and variation in this subtype of volatility increased substantially, especially in the post-2000 period. Volatility among stably competing parties, in contrast, has remained relatively constant since the 1990s. For presidential elections, volatility caused by both party replacement and vote shifts across extant parties de- clined slightly in the recent period. Whereas volatility among established parties accounted for a greater portion of total volatility in the 1980s, average party replacement volatility increased in the 1990s and accounts for a substantially greater portion of all volatility observed than does stable party vola- tility. We further note that, while volatility has tended to in- crease over this period, there are some countries (e.g., Mexico) where the trend does not hold. The region-average patterns do not change across different thresholds, as illustrated by the left versus right panes of ﬁgure 1. 2. A key challenge is how to identify stable vs. new parties. One ap- proach considers new parties resulting from a split or merger as successors of preexisting parties. This can be problematic, as parties formed by splits do not always adhere to the older party’s program (e.g., Mexico’s PRD split from the PRI, Costa Rica’s PAC split from the PLN; see Roberts 2014). Further, parties often run under coalition labels that disband postelection (e.g., Guatemala’s 2011 short-lived UNE-GANA coalition). Mainwaring and Zoco (2007) offer a more nuanced approach, by taking the largest re- sulting party from a split as the continuation of the prior and coding as the predecessor of a merger the party that received the most votes during the last election (see also Powell and Tucker 2014). We deﬁne each party name change as a new observation, even if the new party is the direct successor of an extant party or the product of a merger or split (we exclude minor changes, e.g., the inclusion or exclusion of articles [a, an, the]). This most closely approximates voters’ experiences: changes in names imply infor- mation costs. Thus, our measures of party replacement volatility are ceiling measures that capture the maximal volatility caused by party entry/exit. 3. Some argue that only electorally relevant parties (those that won a given percentage of the total vote [usually 2%, 5%, or 7%]) should be included in analyses of system dynamics because including smaller parties may bias estimates upward (Moraes 2015). Yet, excluding small parties simpliﬁes the political space in ways that do not reﬂect citizens’ decision- making environments. Variation in threshold use and levels has been haphazard, although evidence from Eastern Europe suggests similarity in results across thresholds (see Powell and Tucker 2014). We afﬁrm this conclusion for Latin America: measures of Party Replacement and Stable Party Volatility for the lowest (0) vs. the highest (7%) thresholds are highly correlated, at .97 and .84, respectively. 4. DGDP and Inﬂation data come from the World Bank Development Indicators database; Exchange Rate data, from the International Monetary Fund. We use election-year economic indicators when elections were held in October or later.

In sum, upward trends in Latin American volatility are driven largely by new party entry and party exit.5 These dy- namics have been facilitated by reforms that, in several cases, have made it easier for new parties to form and compete; by low party loyalty among much of the public (see Cohen 2017); and by frequent experimentation in party branding by populists. In contrast to ﬁndings from Eastern Europe and Africa, in posttransition Latin America, a state of disequi- librium persists as parties and the voting public repeatedly churn through new options, frequently tossing out the status quo in favor of new alternatives that offer hope for better outcomes. THE CONTINGENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND VOLATILITY While previous scholarship has found that economic con- ditions shape electoral volatility in Latin America (Main- waring and Zoco 2007; Remmer 1991; Roberts and Wibbels 1999), this relationship has not been explored for more re- cent times and for volatility subtypes in the region. We oper- ationalize economic performance as inﬂation, exchange rate, and change in GDP (gross domestic product) in the year be- fore the election. We control for the effective number of parties and candidates competing and analyze legislative and presi- dential elections separately. We present results using the no- threshold measure; we ﬁnd no substantive difference using a 7% threshold. 6 Data columns 1–4 of table 1 replicate models (e.g., Rem- mer 1991) linking economic performance to volatility in the decade after transitions to democracy across the region (1980– 90). For the 1980–90 period, considering the party replace- ment measure, inﬂation and contractions in GDP predict more volatility in legislative elections, and inﬂation is sig- niﬁcant for presidential elections. Growth negatively pre- dicts stable party volatility in legislative elections in the 1980s, while we ﬁnd no relationship between economic in- dicators and stable party volatility in presidential elections. The 1980s were a volatile time, and some elements of the economy predict electoral volatility. Yet, that result is epoch contingent. Table 1 columns 5–8 show results from a similar set of models for the whole time period. The difference is stark: across a broader range of cases, economic performance var- iables do not reach statistical signiﬁcance. The only possible exceptions come from adopting a more generous threshold for statistical signiﬁcance and, even then, only for inﬂation and exchange rate in one model (col. 8). 7 Results estimated for each decade reveal the same thing: after the economic 5. As stated in n. 2, the measure counts rebranding as a new party entry; this liberal coding strategy allows us to deﬁne the upper bound on volatility levels, avoids arbitrary decisions in distinguishing a new party from a rebranded party, and reﬂects changes that complicate politics and make programmatic voting more difﬁcult. 6. We include country ﬁxed effects for the 1978–2016 models but, because of the small number of cases from 1980 to 1990, do not include ﬁxed effects in those models. 7. The bivariate correlation among the three variables ranges from 0.03 to 20.13 for the full data set. Findings are robust to the stepwise inclusion of economic variables. See tables A4–A6. While we control for some political measures, we acknowledge that the decision to focus pri- marily on the economy could leave the analyses vulnerable to bias, if there are omitted relevant variables that are collinear to these measures.

CONCLUSION Understanding electoral volatility is critical to assessments of democratic party politics. We contribute to this effort with a new database of Latin American electoral outcomes that is more comprehensive in scope and source documentation than databases that are currently in use. We afﬁrm the rel- evance and traveling capacity of a recent framework for electoral volatility—party replacement and established party subtypes—to the Latin American region. We document con- tinued persistence in volatility (Roberts 2014) that runs coun- ter to conclusions reached by scholars examining other third- wave democracies. Finally, while we afﬁrm a classic ﬁnding in scholarship on volatility in Latin America—that economic factors are relevant to political turnover in the 1980s (e.g., Remmer 1991; Roberts and Wibbels 1999)—we show that this link is ephemeral. Overall, economic factors are not robust predictors of electoral volatility in Latin America. Scholars seeking to explain the frequency by which Latin American partiesenter andexit, andwin andlose, will need to broaden their scope to consider other factors as they engage the LAPALE database to move scholarship forward.
