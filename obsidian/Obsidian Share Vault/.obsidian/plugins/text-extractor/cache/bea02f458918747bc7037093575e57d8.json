Case Study (part 1) of low % VRE NEM-wide on 3rd and 4th — July 2023 Posted by PAUL MCARDLE Monday, November 6 2023 Topic: 2023-07-03,04 low % VRE NEM-wide Email I’ve noted before recently (e.g on 2nd November) that we’re* busy at work in crunching a wide range of numbers in order to produce our Genlnsights Quarterly Updates (for 2023 Q3) O By continuing, you accept the privacy * as with prior iterations of this report, these are a collaborative effort between us at Global-Roam Pty Ltd and the team at policy Greenview Strategic Consulting. That’s what we mean here by ‘we’. Subscribe ... are we are looking forward to providing this (with the Executive Briefing) to our subscribing clients when it’s released later in November. This is intended to augment some of the more traditional metrics included in the other two Quarterly Reports we see part of a triptych of Quarterly Reports that can sum up a quarter: 1) The AER’s Wholesale Market Quarterly publication for 2023 Q3 ... published 19th Oct 2023. LAST PUBLICATION 2) The AEMO’s Quarterly Energy Dynamics for 2023 Q3 was published, as published 23rd Oct 2023. Now for 2023 Q3 (for the first time in these reports), we’ve added in the analysis of an additional metric — Percentage [A —— supply from VRE across the NEM. E | (A) Background A couple quick pointers, for a start: (A1) Which is a more useful measure — “% Renewables’ or “% VRE’? meetGenerator In recent years, there’s been an increasing number of people and organisations reporting on instantaneous Statistical Digest penetrations of supply from renewable energy, which can be thought of in two different categories: 20722 Category 1) Forms of renewable energy that are both: @) I on nected to the grid; and also RENT (b) containing SSG against instantaneous variability in the underlying resource; and Category 2) Forms of Variable Renewable Energy ) that are both: (a) I connected to the grid (rather connected via inverter); (b) containing I against instantaneous variability in the underlying resource.
