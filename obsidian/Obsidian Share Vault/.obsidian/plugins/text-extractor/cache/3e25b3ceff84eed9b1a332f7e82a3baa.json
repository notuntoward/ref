The Building and Fire codes specify which building systems require emergency or legally required standby power; the Electrical Code specifies how the power system is to be installed. This Tip explains the basic code provisions regarding emergency and legally required standby power and how they are coordinated in the codes. Emergency Systems Emergency systems are those systems designated as emergency systems by the Seattle Building or Fire Code. The table below lists the types of equipment that are designated as emergency systems in Seattle. These systems are intended to automatically supply illumination, power or both to designated areas and equipment in the event of failure of the normal supply or in the event of accident to elements of a system intended for safety to human life. Legally Required Standby Systems Legally required standby systems are those systems designated as standby systems by the Seattle Build- ing or Fire Code. The table below lists the types of equipment that are designated as legally required standby systems in Seattle. They are intended to automatically maintain power to selected loads (other than those classed as emergency systems) in the event of failure of the normal source. Optional Standby Systems Optional standby systems are systems designated by the building owner or occupant to supply power to facilities or property where life safety does not depend on the performance of the system, but business or operational needs require a continual supply of power in the event of failure of the normal source. Optional standby systems are typically installed to provide an alternate source of electric power to serve loads such as heating and refrigeration systems, data processing and communications systems, and industrial pro- cesses that, when stopped during any power outage, could cause discomfort, serious interruption of the process, or damage to a product or process. Building and Fire Code Provisions In the Seattle codes, in general, emergency power sources are required for:  exit signs, exit lighting and means of egress illumi- nation  emergency voice/alarm communications systems  fire detection and alarms systems  smoke control systems  equipment in smokeproof enclosures  power and lighting for fire command center  lighting for mechanical rooms  elevator car lights  elevator operation for high-rise and underground buildings  fire pumps in high-rise and underground buildings Legally required standby power sources are required for:  pressurization systems in low-rise buildings  fire pumps in low-rise buildings  stretcher-sized elevator cars  horizontal sliding doors  Elevator hoistway smoke control / ventilation SDCI Tip # 339—Emergency and Standby Power Systems page 2 LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This Tip should not be used as a substitute for codes and regulations. The applicant is responsible for compliance with all code and rule requirements, whether or not described in this Tip.  elevators or lifts used as accessible means of egress in low-rise buildings It is important to note that two-hour fire-resistance- rated protection is required for generator rooms inside high-rise buildings and for fire pump conductors. See Seattle Fire Code Section 604.2.15.1 and Electrical Code Section 695.6(B). Electrical Code Provisions For emergency systems, power is required to be sup- plied to the equipment within 10 seconds. Additional time may be allowed to energize the loads after power becomes available. The table below specifies the time allowed. Only loads that are required by the Building or Fire Code to have emergency power may be installed on the emergency system unless the emergency source is of sufficient size to serve all emergency, legally required standby and optional loads. Separate transfer switches must be provided for each of the emergency, legally required standby and optional systems. Auto- matic load-shedding may be needed. The emergency power system wiring must be kept separate from legally required and optional power systems. See NEC 700.9(B). For legally-required standby systems, power is required to be supplied within 60 seconds except for horizontal sliding doors used as a means of egress component which must activate within 10 seconds. Wiring for these systems may be run with other wiring as provided in Section 701.10 except when specifically excluded as in Section 695.6(B) of the Seattle Electrical Code.

The legally required standby service shall be sufficiently separated from the normal main service disconnecting means to prevent simultaneous interruption of supply through an occurrence within the building or groups of buildings served.” See Section 701.11(E) of the Seattle Electrical Code.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
