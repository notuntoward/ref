Since the ﬁrst decade of the new millen- nium, we are increasingly witnessing the widespread availability of smartphones, connected devices and sensor arrays able to provide all sorts of data that carry information about human activity and behaviour, in the form of “digital traces”. Combined with improvements in data storage and processing capabilities, it was just a matter of time before researchers started to explore such datasets for scientiﬁc purposes. Computational and analytical techniques have also evolved in order to deal with these new forms of data, including unstructured data. Among the many ﬁelds in which this “data revolution” has provided valuable input, one in which the contribution has been most disruptive is that of the social sciences (Einav & Levin, 2013; González-Bailón, 2013; Lazer & Radford, 2017). In this context we can see the birth of a new discipline, Computational Social Science (CSS), which can be deﬁned as “the development and application of com- putational methods to complex, typically large-scale, human (sometimes simulated) behavioural data” (Lazer et al., 2009). For the purpose of this handbook, our wish is to propose and to interpret the “behavioural data” in the broadest sense possible. Indeed we interpret as being “CSS-grade” data all pieces of information that, to some extent, provide information about humans: from survey data analysed with advanced computational methods to mobility data from network operators, from news articles to administrative data from municipalities. Since the pioneering contribution of Lazer and co-authors, CSS has reached an advanced degree of maturity, with academic journals completely devoted to the issue (such as the Journal of Computational Social Science2 or EPJ Data Science3), as well as special issues of highly regarded publications covering different aspects of the discipline 1 The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an ofﬁcial position of the European Commission. 2 https://www.springer.com/journal/42001 3 https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/ v vi Preface (such as one published on Nature in July 20214) and academic handbooks devoted to the subject (such as the two volumes of the Handbook of Computational Social Science (Engel et al., 2022). Being a scientiﬁc discipline that explicitly aims at understanding and modelling human behaviour and the interaction between humans and the environment they live in, the potential of CSS as a policymaking tool is self-evident. Despite this potential, a systematic approach towards mainstreaming the use of advanced computational methods and nontraditional data (either as the main source of information or in combination with more traditional ones) in policymaking has yet to be identiﬁed. A ﬁrst step is to map the so-called demand side of CSS across several areas of policymaking by sourcing thematic questions at the interface between policy and research that can be addressed using CSS methods. Based on the investigative/exploratory approach pioneered by the New York University GovLab with the 100 Questions Initiative,5 the editors of the present book have performed a similar yet more extensive and EU-oriented exercise in Bertoni et al. (2022), where a list of thematic questions, drafted by scientists of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, is presented. The policy relevance of the questions is ensured by the speciﬁc role of JRC scientists at the frontier between science and policy, as well as by a mapping of the speciﬁc questions onto the political priorities of the European Commission headed by Ursula Von der Leyen (Von der Leyen, 2019), as well as onto the UN Sustainable Development Goals.6 These questions have represented an enabling factor for the editors to design and produce this handbook, as well as a starting point for the chapter authors to develop their work. We provide a table showing the correspondence between the questions in “Mapping the Demand Side of CSS for Policy” and the chapters of the present book in the front matter of the book. This focus on speciﬁc policy-relevant issues sets the present book apart with respect to the previous literature on CSS. Another relevant difference is its ambition to shed light on the role of CSS techniques in all the phases of the policy cycle (as described in Jann & Wegrich, 2007). CSS methods can be used to help governments and supranational organisations at different stages, from the formulation of policy proposals to their adoption, implementation and evaluation. This is achieved by providing insights on foundational issues and on methodological aspects, as well as by direct applications to policy-relevant ﬁelds. This ambition to encompass all steps of the policy cycle represents a distinguishing point with respect to the book edited by Paruolo and Crato (2019), which is aimed at describing the state of the art with respect to ex-post policy evaluation. The Handbook of Computational Social Science for Policy (CSS4P) is thus divided into three parts: foundational issues, methodological aspects and thematic application of CSS4P respectively. The ﬁrst set of chapters on foundational issues in 4 https://www.nature.com/collections/cadaddgige/ 5 https://the100questions.org/ 6 https://sdgs.un.org/ Preface vii CSS4P opens with an exposition and description of what the key policymaking tasks are in which CSS can provide insights and information. Despite the recent COVID- 19 emergency highlighting the need for access to nontraditional data sources, obstacles still remain to systematic use of CSS in government (Chap. 1). The widespread adoption of CSS in policymaking is still hindered by the presence of limiting factors in terms of access to key data sources, as well as the availability of analytical capabilities; Chap. 2 goes into the details of this issue, providing a taxonomy of governance and policy challenges. Of particular relevance to the policymaking setting are the social justice implications of the use of computational methods, which should be taken into account every time a public sector body decides to implement CSS solutions (Chap. 3). Ethical considerations of Computational Social Science approaches should be factored in not only when it comes to their implementation phase, but from the outset of the deﬁnition of the problem and possible solution, following an ethics-by-design approach; Chap. 4 provides an extended view of this issue from a researcher’s perspective and gives some guidelines in the form of a framework that could help managing this particularly sensitive and important topic. One of the aims of the present book is also to provide critical reviews of the current methodological literature, to better place Computational Social Science studies and their policy applications in the right technical context. Among the most important issues to be tackled, a prominent position is covered by complex systems, which require speciﬁc empirical and simulation methodologies such as agent-based models or machine learning techniques (Chap. 5). Moreover, digital trace data processed in CSS applications—such as large observational data, textual data or behavioural data gathered from large-scale online experiments—requires speciﬁc models, methods and modelling approaches, such as text mining techniques, large- scale behavioural experiments, causal inference and statistical techniques aimed at the reproducibility of science. A discussion around these issues is developed in Chaps. 6, 7 and 8. The use of CSS allows also a systematic improvement of more traditional tasks that involve data gathering and data processing, namely, the territorial impact assessment of policy measures (Chap. 9) and the production of statistics by ofﬁcial statistics ofﬁces (Chap. 10) The remaining part of the handbook is devoted to critically surveying those scientiﬁc ﬁelds in which the potential impact of digital trace data and advanced computational methods is signiﬁcant. CSS has proven to be an effective solution to address current gaps in economic policymaking (Chap. 12), by also providing insights in terms of labour market analysis (Chap. 13) and education economics (Chap. 16), as well as on the economics of social interactions and the related issue of access to economic opportunities (Chap. 21). Another area in which CSS has shown much promise relates to migration topics (Chap. 18) and more generally demography (Chap. 17), as well as the empirical study of human mobility where, in particular, the access to digital trace data can help describe dynamics of our society not captured by traditional sources of data (Chap. 23). Many themes related to the climate crisis, environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation or adaptation strategies are topical areas of interest for policy to which CSS can provide a substantial contribution: the socioeconomic consequences of climate change can viii Preface be modelled using advanced computational methods, both by using simulation techniques such as Integrated Assessment Models, but also via statistical techniques (Chap. 14), while mitigation strategies such as more sustainable transport systems can also be explored (Chap. 24), and crisis management strategies can be improved (Chap. 22). Regional policy can be greatly aided by CSS methods, for example, in terms of understanding the regional variations of food security and nutrition (Chap. 11), but also by analysing what the problems are with the sustainability of tourism economies, e.g. via the use of data coming from online booking and short-term rental platforms (Chap. 19). The recent COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread presence of disinformation and misinformation on vaccines have put a strong attention on epidemiology (Chap. 15) as well as on understanding the information environment connected to such important and critical issues through the scanning and analysis of traditional and nontraditional media sources using neural embeddings, classiﬁcation algorithm and network models (Chap. 20).

The role of the CAS inside the JRC is to enhance the capabilities of the European Commission to better understand and address complex and long-term societal challenges faced by the EU. The road to its completion has been a long one. We started with the project kick- off workshop in May 2021 and then spanned into an exercise of mapping future policy questions to be tackled using computational social science methods. This led to the publication of a science for policy report “Mapping the Demand Side of Computational Social Science for Policy”7 that acts as the inspiration guide for this handbook, where we collected valuable contributions from a community of experts about how those policy questions could be addressed. We are extremely grateful to all the chapter authors for their insightful and wholehearted collaboration. We are also extremely thankful to all the external experts, academics and EC colleagues who believed in the CSS4P project from the start, participated in the kick-off workshop, as well as to the colleagues of the JRC and of the rest of the EC who acted as reviewers, provided suggestions and engaged in active and frank discussions about the book.

WMA World Medical Association Part I Foundational Issues Chapter 1 Computational Social Science for Public Policy Helen Margetts and Cosmina Dorobantu Abstract Computational Social Science (CSS), which brings together the power of computational methods and the analytical rigour of the social sciences, has the potential to revolutionise policymaking. This growing ﬁeld of research can help governments take advantage of large-scale data on human behaviour and provide policymakers with insights into where policy interventions are needed, which interventions are most likely to be effective, and how to avoid unintended consequences. In this chapter, we show how Computational Social Science can improve policymaking by detecting, measuring, predicting, explaining, and sim- ulating human behaviour. We argue that the improvements that CSS can bring to government are conditional on making ethical considerations an integral part of the process of scientiﬁc discovery. CSS has an opportunity to reveal bias and inequalities in public administration and a responsibility to tackle them by taking advantage of research advancements in ethics and responsible innovation. Finally, we identify the primary factors that prevented Computational Social Science from realising its full potential during the Covid-19 pandemic and posit that overcoming challenges linked to limited data ﬂows, siloed models, and rigid organisational structures within government can usher in a new era of policymaking. 1.1 Introduction These are exciting times for social science. Large-scale data was formerly the province of the physical and life sciences, while social science relied mostly on qualitative data or survey data to understand human behaviour. The data revolution from the 2010s onwards, where huge quantities of transactional data are H. Margetts (\u0002) · C.

Bertoni et al. (eds.), Handbook of Computational Social Science for Policy, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16624-2_1 3 4 H. Margetts and C. Dorobantu generated by people’s online actions and interactions, means that for the ﬁrst time, social scientists have access to large-scale, real-time transactional data on human behaviour. With this inﬂux of data, social scientists can and need to develop and adapt computational methods for analysis of large-scale social data. Computational Social Science—the marriage of computational methods and social sciences—can transform how we detect, measure, predict, explain, and simulate human behaviour. Given that public policy is about understanding and potentially changing the world outside—society and the economy—Computational Social Science is well placed to help policymakers with a wide range of tasks, combining as it does computational methods with social scientiﬁc lines of enquiry and theoretical frameworks. Given the struggle that social science often has to demonstrate or receive recognition for policy impact (Bastow et al., 2014), CSS might act as a channel for social science to be appreciated in a policy context. This chapter examines how CSS might assume an increasingly central role in policymaking, bringing social science insight and modes of exploration to the heart of it. The seminal article on CSS (Lazer et al., 2009) laid out how the capacity to analyse massive amounts of data would transform social science into Computational Social Science, just as data-driven models and technologies had transformed biology and physics. ‘We deﬁne CSS as the development and application of computa- tional methods to complex, typically large-scale, human (sometimes simulated) behavioural data [ ... ] Whereas traditional quantitative social science has focused on rows of cases and columns of variables, typically with assumptions of indepen- dence among observations, CSS encompasses language, location and movement, networks, images, and video, with the application of statistical models that capture multifarious dependencies within data’ (Lazer et al., 2009, p. 1060). Although there is no deﬁnitive list of the methodologies that would fall into the category of CSS, it is clear that agent computing, microsimulation, machine learning (ML), complex network analysis, and statistical modelling would all fall into the ﬁeld. We might also add large-scale online experimental methods and some of the ethical thinking that should accompany the handling of large-scale data about human behaviour. Lazer et al.’s early article did not discuss how policymaking or government might also be transformed, although the second article 12 years on (Lazer et al., 2021) emphasised the need to articulate how CSS could tackle societal problems. Given CSS’s emphasis on data and data analysis, the transformative potential of Computational Social Science for policymaking is huge. Traditionally, govern- ments have made little use of transactional data for policymaking (Margetts & Dorobantu, 2019). That is not surprising, given that bureaucratic organisation from the earliest forms of the state relied on ‘the ﬁles’ for information (Muellerleile & Robertson, 2018). Paper-based ﬁles offer the capability to ﬁnd individual pieces of data but generate no usable data for analysis. Likewise, the large-scale computer systems which gradually replaced these ﬁles from the 1950s onwards in the largest governments also had no capacity to generate usable data (Margetts, 1999). For decades, governments’ transactional data resulting from their interactions with citizens languished in ‘legacy systems’, unavailable to policymakers. During this period, data and modelling existed in government but relied on custom built ‘ofﬁcial 1 Computational Social Science for Public Policy 5 statistics’ or performance indicators, or long-running annual surveys, such as the UK ‘British Crime Survey’. Only with the internet and the latest generation of data- driven models and technologies has there been the possibility for policymakers to use large-scale transactional data to inform decision-making. This chapter outlines key policymaking tasks for which CSS can be used: detection, measurement, prediction, etiology,1 and simulation. It discusses how CSS needs to be ‘ethics-driven,’ revealing bias and inequalities and tackling them by taking advantage of research advancements in ethics and responsible innovation. Then, the chapter examines how the potential of CSS tools has been highlighted in the pandemic crisis but also how CSS failed to realise this potential due to weaknesses in data ﬂows, models, and organisational structures. Finally, the chapter considers how CSS might be used to tackle future crisis situations, renewing the policy toolkit for more resilient policymaking. 1.2 Detection Detection is one of the ‘essential capabilities that any system of control must possess at the point where it comes into contact with the world outside’ (Hood & Margetts, 2008). Government is no exception, needing to understand societal and economic behaviour, trends, and patterns and to calibrate policy accordingly. That includes detection of unwanted (or less often, wanted) behaviour of citizens and ﬁrms to inform policy responses. Data-intensive technologies, such as machine learning, lend themselves very well to the performance of detection tasks. Advances in machine learning over the past decade make it a powerful tool in the analysis of both structured and unstructured data. Structured data refers to data points that are stored in a machine- readable format. ML is well suited to the performance of detection tasks that rely on structured data, such as pinpointing fraudulent transactions in large-scale ﬁnancial data. The progress made by researchers and practitioners in the ﬁelds of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision now also makes ML well suited to the analysis of unstructured data, such as human language and visual data (Ostmann & Dorobantu, 2021). ML can perform detection tasks that were outside the realm of possibilities in earlier decades due to our inability, in the past, to process large quantities of structured and unstructured data. A good illustration of where Computational Social Science and policymakers can work side-by-side to detect unwanted behaviour relates to online harm. Online harm is a growing problem in most countries, including (but not limited to) the gen- 1 Etiology is a term often used in the medical sciences, meaning ‘the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition’. (Oxford Languages from Oxford University Press). Here we use it more broadly, to refer to the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of phenomena of interest within the social sciences. 6 H. Margetts and C. Dorobantu eration, organisation, and dissemination of hate speech, misinformation, misleading advertising, ﬁnancial scams, radicalisation, extremism, terrorist networks, sexual exploitation, and sexual abuse. Nearly all governments are tackling at least some of these harms via a range of public agencies. Criminal justice agencies need to track and monitor the perpetrators of harm; intelligence agencies need to scrutinise security threats, while regulators need to detect and monitor the behaviour of a huge array of data-powered platforms, particularly social media ﬁrms. How can Computational Social Science help policymakers? A growing number of computational social scientists are focusing on the detection of harmful behaviour online, seeking to understand the dissemination and impact of such behaviour, which is a social as well as a computational task. Machine learning classiﬁers need to be built, and this is a highly technical task, requiring cutting edge computer science expertise and facing huge challenges (see Röttger et al., 2021). Butitis those with social science training that are comfortable dealing with the normative questions of deﬁning terms such as ‘hate’. And it is social scientists who are able to explore the motivations behind harmful online behaviour; to understand the differential impacts of different kinds of harm (e.g., misinformation has different dynamics from hate speech, see Taylor et al., 2021); and to explore how we can build distinct classiﬁers for different kinds of online harm or different targets of harm, such as misogyny (Guest et al., 2021) or sinophobia (Vidgen et al., 2020). By bringing together the development of technical tools and the rigour and normative stance of the social sciences, Computational Social Science offers a holistic and methodologically sound solution to policymakers interested in tackling online harm. Regulation for online safety is a key area where CSS is uniquely qualiﬁed to help. Regulators need to develop methodological expertise but often struggle to keep ahead of the perpetrators of unwanted online behaviour and the massive platforms where these harms play out. While CSS expertise is growing in this area, the platforms themselves have incubated parallel streams of in-house research, with different motivations, conﬁdentiality, secrecy, and lack of data sharing preventing knowledge transfer between the two. This leaves an important role for academic researchers, working directly with regulators to help them understand the ‘state-of- the-art’ research in promoting online safety. 1.3 Measurement Another key capability of government is measurement. Policymakers need to be able to monitor and track societal and economic trends and patterns in order to understand when interventions are needed. The technologies that were available to us prior to the data revolution limited our ability to collect, store, and analyse data. These technological limitations meant that in the past, policymakers and academic researchers alike were at best able to measure socio-economic phenomena imprecisely and at worst unable to measure them at all. For example, policymakers and researchers have been trying 1 Computational Social Science for Public Policy 7 for decades to understand visitation rates at public parks (see, e.g., Cheung, 1972). This understanding is needed for a range of policy interventions, from protecting green spaces and increasing investment in parks to driving up community usage. But what seems like a simple metric, the number of visitors to a park, has been difﬁcult to produce in practice. The solution preferred by many local authorities has been to hire contractors and ask them to stand at the entrance of a park and count the number of people going in. This solution has obvious limitations: it is costly, it can only measure park attendance for limited periods of time, it is prone to measurement error, and it fails to capture characteristics of the people visiting the park—to name only a few. Complex socio-economic phenomena are even more difﬁcult to measure. Firms, consumers, and policymakers are increasingly worried about inﬂation, a phe- nomenon that threatens the post-pandemic economic recovery. Yet despite the fact that so many eyes and newspaper headlines focus on the consumer price index, few know the difﬁculties of collecting and generating it. In the UK, for example, the Ofﬁce for National Statistics calculates the Consumer Prices Index. The index largely rests on the physical collection of data in stores across 141 locations in the UK. At a time when we needed precise inﬂation measures the most, during the Covid-19 crisis, the data collection efforts for the Consumer Prices Index were severely affected by store closures and social distancing measures. Furthermore, the labour-intensive nature of collecting and generating the Consumer Prices Index means that it cannot be, with its current design, a real-time measure. National statistical ofﬁces usually publish it once a month with the understanding that it reﬂects the reality of a few weeks back. Computational Social Science allows new opportunities to measure and monitor socio-economic phenomena—from park usage to inﬂation. Recent research uncov- ered the value of using social media data and mobile phone app data to measure park visitation (see, e.g., Donahue et al., 2018; Hamstead et al., 2018; Sinclair et al., 2021;Suse et al., 2021). Attempts to create real-time measures of inﬂation go back more than a decade. In 2010, Google’s chief economist, Hal Varian, revealed that the company was working on a Google Price Index—a real-time measure of price changes calculated by monitoring prices online. Although Google never published this measure, it hints at the possibilities of using computational methods and economic expertise to move beyond the inﬂation measures that we have today. More generally, Computational Social Science could facilitate a wholescale rethinking of how we measure key socio-economic indicators. As Lazer et al. (2021) reﬂected in their study of ‘Meaningful measures of human society in the twenty-ﬁrst century’: Existing measures of key concepts such as gross domestic product and geographical mobility are shaped by the strengths and weaknesses of twentieth century data. If we only evaluate new measures against the old, we simply replicate their shortcomings, mistaking the gold standard of the twentieth century for objective truth. Traditional social science methods of data analysis tend to perpetuate themselves. Survey researchers, for example, are reluctant to relinquish either long-running 8 H. Margetts and C. Dorobantu surveys or questions within them. This means that over time, surveys become longer and longer and increasingly unsuited to measuring behavioural trends in digital environments (e.g., asking people what they did online is a highly inaccurate way of determining digital behaviour compared with transactional data). Computational Social Science gives us the ability to improve our measurements so that everything—from basic summary stats to the most sophisticated measures— can move away from having to rely on old measurements that are limited by the technologies and data that were available decades ago. 1.4 Prediction Another tool that Computational Social Science has to offer to policymakers is predictive capability. Machine learning is increasingly used within the private sector to perform prediction and forecasting tasks, as it is well suited to the performance of these tasks. Governments and public sector organisations in general do not have a good record on forecasting and prediction, so this is another area where CSS can add to policymakers’ toolkit. Policymakers can use machine learning to spot problematic trends and relationships of concern before they have a detrimental impact and to predict points of failure within a system. One of the most common uses of machine learning by local and central governments is to predict where problems are most likely to arise with the aim of identifying ‘objects’ (from restaurants and schools to customs forms) for inspection and scrutiny. The largest study on the use of machine learning in US federal government provides the example of the US Food and Drug Administration, which uses machine learning techniques to model relationships between drugs and hepatic liver failure (Engstrom et al., 2020, p. 55), with decision trees and simple neural networks used to predict serious drug- related adverse outcomes. The same agency also uses regularised regression models, random forest, and support vector techniques to construct a rank ordering of reports based on their probability of containing policy-relevant information about safety concerns. This allows the agency to prioritise for attention those that are most likely to reveal problems. Machine learning can also be used to predict demand, helping policymakers plan for the future. When used in this way, it can be a good way to optimise resources, allowing government agencies to be prescient in terms of service provision and to direct human attention or ﬁnancial resources where they are most required. For example, some police forces use machine learning to predict where crime hotspots will arise and to anticipate when and where greater police presence will be needed. Recent studies on the use of data science in UK local government (Bright et al., 2019; Vogl et al., 2020) estimate that 15% of UK local authorities were using data science to build some kind of predictive capability in 2018, when the research was carried out. The use of machine learning for prediction in policymaking is controversial, however. Some have argued that the predictive capacity of Computational Social 1 Computational Social Science for Public Policy 9 Science brings tension to the ﬁeld, sitting happily with the epistemological aims of computer scientists, but going against the tradition of social science research, which prioritises explanations of individual and collective behaviour, ideally via causal mechanisms (Hofman et al., 2021, p. 181). Kleinberg et al. (2015) argue that some important policy problems do beneﬁt from prediction alone and that machine learning can generate high policy impact as well as theoretical insights (Kleinberg et al., 2015, p. 495). But this use of machine learning generates important ethical questions of fairness and bias (discussed below), as the use of the COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Proﬁling for Alternative Sanctions) system for predictive sentencing in the USA has shown (see Hartmann & Wenzelburger, 2021). Furthermore, as Athey (2017) explains, many of the prediction solutions described (e.g., in health care and criminal justice) require some kind of causal inference to achieve payoffs, even where prediction is most commonly cited as beneﬁcial, such as the identiﬁcation of building sites or other entities for inspection and scrutiny. Overall, she concludes, multidisciplinary approaches are needed that build on the development of machine learning algorithms but also ‘bring in the methods and practical learning from decades of multidisciplinary research using empirical evidence to inform policy’. In a similar vein, Hofman et al. (2021) make the case for integrative modelling, developing models that ‘explicitly integrate explanatory and predictive thinking’, arguing that such an approach is likely to add value over and above what can be achieved with either technique alone and deserves more attention than it has received so far. 1.5 Etiology The possibilities of detection, measurement, and prediction that CSS methods afford to tackle policy problems do not obviate the need for understanding the underlying causes of observed behaviours, as discussed in the preceding section. Etiology is particularly important when policymakers try to understand human behaviour in digital settings, where they need also to understand how the digital context, including the design of platforms and the algorithms they use, drive behaviour. Wagner et al. (2021) observe that in the ‘algorithmically infused society’ in which we now live, algorithms shape our behaviour in many contexts: shopping, travelling, socialising, entertainment, and so on. In such a world, the data that we derive from platforms like Twitter gives us useful clues about our interactions, but the social sciences is the only lens through which we can learn to separate what is ‘natural’ human behaviour and what is algorithm-induced human behaviour. The social sciences are also the domain that gives us the theoretical starting point for re-examining frameworks, models, and theories that were developed when algorithms were not a prevalent part of our lives. We need to understand both how algorithmic ampliﬁcation (e.g., via recommender systems or other forms of social information) inﬂuences relationship formation, while also understanding how social adaptation causes algorithms to change. This understanding is particularly important 10 H. Margetts and C. Dorobantu for regulators, who need to know how digital platforms are inﬂuencing consumer preferences and behaviour (e.g., through targeted advertising) and which elements of the behaviours we notice online are attributable to the algorithms themselves. Scientiﬁc researchers need to develop this kind of expertise. Although streams of research are being developed within, for example, social media companies, around issues of content moderation and algorithm design, the primary aim of this work is to limit reputational damage. The companies themselves have little motivation to invest in programmes of research that uncover the organisational dynamics of online harms or the impact of such harms on different groups of citizens. They also have limited incentives to share the ﬁndings of such research, even if they decide to carry it out. CSS can also help with etiology via experimental methods. Early social sci- ence experiments used survey data or laboratory-based experiments, which were expensive and labour-intensive and quickly resulted in small numbers problems. In contrast, online randomised controlled trials based on large-scale datasets can operate at huge scale and in real time. Such behavioural insights have been used by governments, for example, testing out the effects of redesigning letters and texts urging people to pay tax on time (Hallsworth et al., 2017). Large-scale digital data also offers the possibility of identifying ‘natural experiments’ (Dunning, 2012)in policy settings, where some disruption of normal activity at a point in time or in a particular location occurs, and the data is analysed after the disruption, as an ‘as if random’ treatment group. An example is provided by Transport for London’s analysis of their Oyster card data to understand the effects of a 2014 industrial dispute which led to a strike of many of the system’s train drivers (described in Dunleavy, 2016)). During the strike, millions of passengers switched their journey patterns to avoid their normal lines and stations hit by the strike. Larcom et al. (2017) examined Oyster card data for periods before and after the strike period, linking journeys to cardholders. They found that 1 in 20 passengers changed their journey, and a high proportion of these stayed with their new journey pattern when normal service resumed, suggesting their new route was better for them. The ﬁndings suggested that Tube travellers only ‘satisﬁce’ and had originally gone with the ﬁrst acceptable travel solution that they found, later settling on the new route because it saved them time. The analysts also showed that the travel time gains made by the small share of commuters switching routes as a result of the Tube strike more than offset the economic costs to the vast majority (95%), who simply got disrupted on this one occasion. So the strike led to net gains, suggesting that possible side beneﬁts of disruptions might be factored in by policymakers when making future decisions (like whether to close a Tube line wholly in order to accomplish urgent improvements (Dunleavy, 2016)). Natural experiments like this can be hard to systematise or ﬁnd. But large-scale observational data can be used to identify causal inference even where there is no identiﬁable ‘as if random’ treatment group or no counterfactual control group. Large-scale data analysis offers ‘New tricks for Econometrics’ (Varian, 2014), for example, where datasets are split into small worlds, creating artiﬁcial ‘control groups’ via a predictive model based on a function of past history and possible 1 Computational Social Science for Public Policy 11 predictors of success. CSS methods have developed hugely in this area, especially in economics. Athey and Imbens (2017) discuss a range of such strategies, including regression discontinuity designs, synthetic control and differences-in-differences methods, methods that deal with network effects, and methods that combine experimental and observational data—as well as supplementary analyses (such as sensitivity and robustness analysis)—where the results are intended to convince the reader of the credibility of the primary analysis. They argue that machine learning methods hold great promise for improving the credibility of policy evaluation, particularly through these supplementary strategies. 1.6 Simulation Another way in which CSS can tackle policy issues is through the development of simulation methods, allowing policymakers to try out interventions before imple- menting the measures in the real-world and having them give rise to unintended and unanticipated consequences. As noted above, policy choices need to be informed by counterfactuals: if we implemented this measure—or didn’t implement it—what would happen? An increasing range of modelling approaches can now be used for simulation, including complex network analysis and microsimulation, involving highly detailed analysis of, for example, trafﬁc ﬂows, labour mobility, urban industrial agglomera- tion patterns, or disease spread. One modelling approach that is gaining popularity with the growing availability of large-scale data is agent computing. Agent-based models (ABMs) have been used to study socio-economic phenomena for decades. Thomas Schelling was among the ﬁrst to use agent-based modelling techniques within the social sciences. In the early 1970s, he published a seminal paper that showed how a simple dynamic model sheds light on how segregation can arise from the interplay of individual choices (see Schelling, 1971). But models like Schelling’s—and many others that followed—were ‘toy models’: formal models without any real-world data to ground them in the socio-economic reality that they were meant to study. In contrast, the agent computing models used now are based on large-scale data, which transforms them into powerful tools for researchers and policymakers alike. Rob Axtell, one of the pioneers of Computational Social Science, recently developed a model of the US private sector, in which 120 million agents self-organise into 6 million ﬁrms (Axtell, 2018). Models like Axtell’s are extremely powerful tools for studying the dynamics of socio-economic phenomena and carrying out simulations of complex systems, from economies to transport networks. Today’s agent computing models can also be used in combination with machine learning methods, where the models provide a practical framework to combine data and theory without constraining oneself with too many unrealistic a priori assumptions about how socio-economic systems behave, such as ‘fully rational agents’ or ‘complete information’. 12 H. Margetts and C. Dorobantu An agent computing model consists of individual software agents, with states and rules of behaviour and large corpuses of data pertaining to the agents’ behaviour and relationships. Running such a model could theoretically amount to instantiating an agent population, letting the agents interact, and monitoring what happens; ‘Indeed, in their most extreme form, agent-based computational models will not make any use whatsoever of explicit equations’ (Axtell, 2000, p. 3). But models usually involve some combination of data and formulae. Researchers have started to explore the possibilities of ‘societal digital twins’ (Birks et al., 2020), a combination of spatial computing, agent-based models, and ‘digital twins’—virtual data-driven replicas of real-world systems that have become popular for modelling physical systems, in engineering or infrastructure planning, for example. Such ‘societal’ twins would use agent computing to model the socio-economic world, although the proponents warn that the complexity of socio-economic systems and the slower development of real-time updating means that the societal equivalent of digital twins is ‘a long way from being able to simulate real human systems’ (Birks et al., 2020, p. 2884). Agent computing has gained popularity as a tool for transport planning or providing insight for decision-makers in disaster scenarios such as nuclear attacks or pandemics (Waldrop, 2018). UNDP are also trialling the use of an agent computing model to help developing countries work out which policy areas— health, education, transport, and so on—should be prioritised in order to meet the sustainable development goals (Guerrero & Castañeda, 2020). Mainstream economics modelling has struggled to keep pace with the new possibilities brought about by the growing availability of large-scale data, meaning that computational social scientists can and should play a key role in developing collaborations with policymakers and forging a new ﬁeld of research aimed at enabling governments to design evidence-based policy interventions. 1.7 An Ethics-Driven Computational Social Science CSS methods are data-driven. Machine learning models in this ﬁeld are trained on data from human systems. For example, a model to support judicial decision- making will be trained on large datasets generated by earlier judicial decisions. That means that if decision-making in the past or present is biased—clearly the case in some areas, such as policing—then the machine learning algorithms trained on this data will be biased also. The use of the resulting machine learning tools in decision-making processes will reinforce and amplify existing biases. In part for this reason, extensive controversy has accompanied the use of machine learning for decision support, particularly in sensitive areas such as criminal justice (Hartmann & Wenzelburger, 2021; Završnik, 2021) or child welfare (Leslie et al., 2020). The CSS methods discussed in this chapter raise numerous ethical concerns, from replicating biases to invading people’s privacy, limiting individual autonomy, eroding public trust, and introducing unnecessary opaqueness into decision-making 1 Computational Social Science for Public Policy 13 processes—to name only a few. To tackle these issues, CSS should take advantage of the work that has been done on the ethical use of AI technologies in government. Guidance on the responsible design, development, and implementation of AI systems in the public sector (Leslie, 2019) and a framework for explaining decisions made with AI (Information Commissioner’s Ofﬁce & The Alan Turing Institute, 2020) are used across UK departments and agencies. These publications focus on how the principles of fairness, sustainability, safety, accountability, and transparency can—and should—guide the responsible design, development, and deployment of AI systems. In contrast, Computational Social Science research has focused far more on the technical details of these data-intensive technologies rather than the ethical concerns, which tend to be underplayed. A recent special issue of Nature on CSS,2 for example, mentioned ethics and responsible innovation only once in the editorial, and none of the articles focused on the topic. So in this case, CSS could have something to learn from recent work on trustworthy and responsible AI innovation for the public sector. There are signiﬁcant gains to be had if computational social science makes ethics an integral part of the process of scientiﬁc discovery. CSS methods are data-driven, using data generated by existing administrative systems. Rather than replicating biases, CSS can play an important role in shedding light, sometimes for the ﬁrst time, on the bias endemic in human decision-making. As large-scale data sources become available, CSS could be used to reveal and tackle bias in modern digital public administration and policymaking. Identifying bias and understanding its origins can be a ﬁrst step towards tackling long-running failings of administration. 1.8 Building Resilience: CSS at the Heart of a Reinvented Policy Toolkit Nowhere are the possibilities of CSS for public policy—and the importance of realising them—illustrated more starkly than in the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 onwards. Computational Social Science seemed, to these authors at least, to have huge potential for the design of policy interventions and informing decision-making during the pandemic, for example, through undertaking the key tasks of detection, measurement, prediction, etiology, and simulation laid out above. But somehow, the use of CSS in this setting was disappointing. While it was good to see data, modelling, and science in such high relief throughout the pandemic, the use of CSS was limited and many interventions were introduced with no real evidence of their expected payoffs. The difﬁculties seemed to be threefold. First, many countries discovered that they did not collect the kind of real-time, ﬁne-grained data that was needed to inform policy design. In the UK, for example, it turned out that there was no availability 2 Nature volume 595, issue 7866, 2021 14 H. Margetts and C. Dorobantu of data on the number of people dying of Covid-19 until weeks after the deaths had taken place, making it impossible to calibrate the use of interventions. Economic policymakers had to design ﬁnancial support mechanisms such as furlough schemes and stimulus packages without ﬁne grained data about the areas of the economy that would be most affected by social distancing measures and supply chain disruptions. This meant that blanket schemes were applied, helping sectors that beneﬁted from the pandemic (such as delivery companies and many technology ﬁrms) along with those that had been devastated (such as travel and hospitality). Policymakers and computational social scientists need to work together to identify the data streams that are likely to be needed in a crisis and ‘develop dynamic capabilities’ (Mazzucato & Kattel, 2020). Second, there seemed to be a universal lack of integrated modelling. The focus tended to be on modelling one policy area at a time. There were models that tracked the spread of the virus and separate models that examined the economic effects. These two issues, however, were inextricably intertwined. The absence of integrated models to capture these interdependencies meant that policymakers often pointed to the trade-off between ‘public health’ and ‘economic recovery’ but were never able to pinpoint optimal interventions. There is a need for CSS to develop more integrated, generalised models that policymakers could turn to in an emergency. Besides their inability to capture interdependencies between policy areas, many economic models proved to be incapable of dealing with surprises. Models of commodity prices, for example, were based on the assumption that negative oil prices were impossible. During the pandemic, it became clear that not enough attention is given to quantifying uncertainty, which can have a cascading effect in complex multi-level systems. To help policymakers equip themselves for future crises, we need to develop CSS models that are based on robust assumptions and are able to quantify uncertainty. Integrated modelling, data-centric policymaking, causal inference, and uncertainty quantiﬁcation are all ways in which CSS might build resilience into policymaking processes (MacArthur et al., 2022). Third, it became clear that the organisational structures involved in policymaking to some extent worked against the kind of computational and modelling exper- tise that was required during the pandemic. Big departments of state have few incentives to share data, and very little tradition of sharing technical solutions to policy problems. This is unfortunate, because the vertical nature of data-intensive methods means that they lend themselves to being transferred across organisational boundaries. Yet policymakers seeking to meet a generic modelling challenge—such as how to identify vulnerable groups, quantify uncertainty or use machine learning to derive causal explanations as laid out above—are much more likely to seek help in their own department than to turn to departments or agencies in other parts of government. This siloed approach works against building up of expertise. Overcoming these issues could allow CSS to usher in a new era of policymaking. As we begin to emerge from the pandemic, the word ‘resilience’ has become widespread in policy circles. Resilience is an organisational value that underpins how a government designs its policymaking systems and processes (Hood, 1991). Governments that value resilience prioritise stability, robustness, and adaptability. 1 Computational Social Science for Public Policy 15 Developing the CSS tools and models we have discussed here, with the focus on detecting and measuring trends and patterns, predicting and understanding human behaviour, and developing integrative modelling techniques that can simulate policy interventions all point in this direction. A resilient approach of this kind could equip policymakers to tackle the aftermath of the pandemic and face future crises (MacArthur et al., 2022). 1.9 Conclusion This chapter has shown some of the transformational potential of Computational Social Science, bringing analysis of large-scale social and economic data into policymaking. CSS can renew the toolbox of contemporary government, refreshing and sharpening the essential tasks of detection, measurement, prediction, simula- tion, and etiology. None of these tasks can, alone, transform the policy toolkit. They need to be used in concert and require large-scale, real-time, ﬁne-grained data sources. Measurement, for example, requires detection to be able to observe trends in the variable under scrutiny. Both are needed for prediction, which on its own is of questionable value in policy settings that lack the ability to pinpoint causality. Many researchers are making the case for integrative modelling that incorporates prediction and causal inference. Simulation requires large-scale data and is often used in conjunction with more predictive techniques. New possibilities for the use of large-scale data about human behaviour bring new responsibilities, in terms of implementing and developing guidelines and frameworks for responsible innovation. Substantial progress has already been made in building ethical frameworks for the growing use of artiﬁcial intelligence in government. Guided by these frameworks, CSS researchers have a real opportunity to make explicit long-running biases and entrenched inequalities in public policy and administration. Their scholarship and methodologies have the potential to usher in a new era of policymaking, where interventions and administrative systems are more fair than ever before, as well as more efﬁcient, effective, responsive, and prescient (Margetts & Dorobantu, 2019). The need to respond to the coronavirus pandemic has raised the proﬁle of data and modelling but has also illustrated missed opportunities in terms of data ﬂows, integrative modelling, and the development of expertise. To face future crises, we need to overcome these challenges, bringing CSS methods to the heart of policymaking and developing models to inform the design of resilient policy interventions. 16 H.

Chapter 2 Computational Social Science for the Public Good: Towards a Taxonomy of Governance and Policy Challenges Stefaan Gerard Verhulst Abstract Computational Social Science (CSS) has grown exponentially as the process of dataﬁcation and computation has increased. This expansion, however, is yet to translate into effective actions to strengthen public good in the form of policy insights and interventions. This chapter presents 20 limiting factors in how data is accessed and analysed in the ﬁeld of CSS. The challenges are grouped into the following six categories based on their area of direct impact: Data Ecosystem, Data Governance, Research Design, Computational Structures and Processes, the Scientiﬁc Ecosystem, and Societal Impact. Through this chapter, we seek to construct a taxonomy of CSS governance and policy challenges. By ﬁrst identifying the problems, we can then move to effectively address them through research, funding, and governance agendas that drive stronger outcomes. 2.1 Introduction We live in a digital world, where virtually every realm of our existence has been transformed by a rapid and ongoing process of dataﬁcation and computation. Travel, retail, entertainment, ﬁnance, and medicine: to these areas of life, all grown virtually unrecognizable in recent years, we must also add the social sciences. In recent years the burgeoning ﬁeld of Computational Social Science (CSS) has begun changing the way sociologists, anthropologists, economists, political scientists, and others interpret human behaviour and motivations, in the process leading to new insights into human society. Some have gone so far as to herald a “social research revolution” or a “paradigm shift” in the social sciences (Chang et al., 2014; Porter et al., 2020). Recently, the Economist magazine proclaimed an era of “third-wave economics”, S. G. Verhulst (\u0002) The GovLab, New York University, New York, NY, USA ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy e-mail: stefaan@thegovlab.org © The Author(s) 2023 E. Bertoni et al. (eds.), Handbook of Computational Social Science for Policy, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16624-2_2 19 20 S.G. Verhulst transformed by the availability of massive amounts of real-time data (Kansas, 2021). Of course social scientists have always used data to interpret and analyse human beings and the social structures they create. CSS, as a concept, ﬁrst emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century across the ﬁeld of social science and STEM (Edelmann et al., 2020). Earlier generations of researchers were well-versed in quantitative methods, as well as in the use of a variety of computational and statistical tools, ranging from SPSS to Excel. What has changed is the sheer quantity of data now available, as well as the easy (and often free) access to sophisticated computational tools to process and analyse that data. To the extent there is indeed a revolution underway in the social sciences, then, it stems in large part from its intersection with the equally heralded Big Data Revolution (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2019). CSS offers some very real opportunities. It enables new forms of research (e.g., large-scale simulations and more accurate predictions), allows social scientists to model and derive ﬁndings from a much larger empirical base, and offers the potential for new, cross-disciplinary insights that could lead to innovative and more effective social or economic policy interventions. In recent years, CSS has allowed researchers to better understand, among other phenomena, the roots and patterns of socioeconomic inequalities, how infectious diseases spread, trends in crime and other factors contributing to social malaise, and much more. As with many technological innovations, however, the rhetoric—and hype— surrounding CSS can sometimes overtake reality (Blosch & Fenn, 2018). For all the undeniable opportunities, there remains a chasm between potential and what CSS is actually doing and revealing. Bridging this chasm could unlock new social insights and also, through more targeted and responsive policy interventions, lead to greater opportunities to enhance public good. This chapter seeks to take stock of and categorize a variety of governance and policy hurdles that continue to hold back the potential of CSS. In what follows, we outline 20 challenges that limit how data is accessed and analysed in the social sciences. We categorize these into six areas: challenges associated with the Data Ecosystem, Data Governance, Research Design, Computational Structures and Processes,the Scientiﬁc Ecosystem, and those concerned with Societal Impact (Fig. 2.1). Albert Einstein once said, “If I had an hour to solve a problem I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and ﬁve minutes thinking about solutions”. In the spirit of Einstein’s maxim, we do not seek to provide detailed solutions to the identiﬁed challenges. Instead, our goal is to design a taxonomy of challenges and issues that require further exploration, in the hope of setting a research, funding, and governance agenda that could advance the ﬁeld of CSS and help unleash its full potential. 2 Computational Social Science for the Public Good: Towards a Taxonomy... 21 Fig. 2.1 Taxonomy of governance and policy challenges 2.2 Data Ecosystem Challenges 2.2.1 Data Accessibility: Paucity and Asymmetries Although CSS is enabled by the massive explosion in data availability, in truth access to data remains a serious bottleneck. Accessibility problems can take many forms. In certain cases, accessibility can be limited when certain kinds of data simply don’t exist. Such data paucity problems were more common in the early days of CSS but remain a challenge in particular areas of social science research, for example, in the study of certain disaster events (Burger et al., 2019). The challenges posed by data paucity are not limited to an inability to conduct research; the risk of wrong or inappropriate conclusions, built upon shaky empirical foundations, must 22 S.G. Verhulst equally be considered. Such limitations can to an extent be overcome by reliance on new and innovative forms of data—for example, those collected by social media companies or through sensors and other devices on the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) (Hernandez-Suarez et al., 2019). Even when sufﬁcient data exists, however, accessibility can remain a problem due to asymmetries and inequalities in patterns of data ownership, as well as due to regulatory or policy bottlenecks (OECD, 2019). Recent attention on corporate concentration in the technology industry has shed light on related issues, including the vast stores of siloed data held by private sector entities that remain inaccessible to researchers and others (The World Wide Web Foundation, 2016). The European Union, for example, is working to address this challenge through policies like the Data Act, which attempts to bridge existing inequalities in access to and use of data (Bahrke & Manoury, 2022). While the open data movement and other efforts to spur data collaboratives (and similar entities) 1 have made strides in opening up some of these silos, a range of obstacles—reluctance to share data perceived as having competitive value, apprehension about inadvertently violating privacy-protective laws—mean that considerable amounts of private sector data with potential public good applications remain inaccessible (Verhulst et al., 2020b). Access to such large datasets could lead to more effective decision-making in both the corporate and policymaking worlds, as well as stronger transparency and accountability measures across sectors (Russo & Feng, 2021). Concerns around heightened public scrutiny and regulatory exposure as a result of greater transparency and accountability measures are also in part why larger corporations may resist open data policies. 2.2.2 Misaligned or Negative Incentives for Collaborating Misaligned incentives are a common and well-understood problem in the worlds of business and social sciences. Misaligned incentives commonly occur when certain individuals’ or groups’ incentives are not aligned towards the broader common goal of the collaboration. These incentives can be based on speciﬁc parties’ interests, as well as on differences between long-term and short-term priorities (Novak, 2011). In a business supply chain, for example, misaligned incentives can cause a number of issues, ranging from operational inefﬁciency to higher production costs to weak market visibility (Narayanan & Raman, 2004). In order for supply chain relationships to function optimally, incentives must be realigned through trust, transparency, stronger communication, regulation, and clear contracts. Many of these same concepts apply to the data sharing and data collaboration ecologies and thus to how data is used for CSS. Misaligned incentives can take 1 Data Collaboratives are a new form of collaboration, beyond the public-private partnership model, in which participants from different sectors — in particular companies —exchange their data to create public value. For more information, see https://datacollaboratives.org/. 2 Computational Social Science for the Public Good: Towards a Taxonomy... 23 a number of forms but commonly refer to conﬂicts or differences between data owners (frequently in the private sector) and those who would potentially beneﬁt or be able to derive insights from access to data (frequently academic researchers, policy analysts, or members of civil society). Data owners may perceive efforts to share data with social scientists as potentially leading to competitive threats, or they may perceive regulatory risk; social scientists, on the other hand, will perceive data collaboration as leading to new insights that can enhance the public good. There are no easy solutions to such misalignments, and alleviating them will rely on a complex interplay of regulation, awareness-raising, and efforts to increase transparency and trust. For the moment, misaligned incentives remain a serious impediment to CSS research. 2.2.3 Poorly Understood (and Studied) Value Proposition, Beneﬁts, and Risks Misaligned incentives often arise when data owners and social scientists (or others who may beneﬁt from data sharing) have different perceptions about the beneﬁts or risks of sharing. David Lazer et al. note, for instance, that the incidence of data sharing and opening of data may have reduced in the wake of laws designed to protect privacy (e.g., GDPR) (Lazer et al., 2020). This suggests that companies may overestimate the regulatory and other risks of making data available to researchers, while under-valuing the possible beneﬁts. Companies dealing may also face real concerns about data protection and data privacy that are not effectively addressed by laws. Likewise, companies may be reluctant to share data, fearing that doing so will erode a competitive advantage or otherwise harm the bottom line. As our research has shown, this is often a mis-perception (Dahmm, 2020). Data sharing does not operate in a zero-sum ecosystem, and companies willing to open their data to external researchers may ultimately reap the beneﬁts of new insights and new uses for their otherwise siloed datasets. 2.3 Data Governance Challenges 2.3.1 Data Reuse, Purpose Speciﬁcation, and Minimization A spate of privacy scandals has led to renewed regulatory oversight of data, data sharing, and data reuse. Such oversight is often justiﬁed and very necessary. At the same time, an exclusive focus on privacy risks undermining some of the societal beneﬁts of sharing; we need a more calibrated and nuanced understanding of risk (Verhulst, 2021). Purpose speciﬁcation and minimization mandates, which seek to narrowly limit the scope of how data may be reused, pose particular challenges to 24 S.G. Verhulst CSS. Such laws or guidelines do offer greater consumer control over their data and can thus be trust-enhancing. At the same time, serious consideration must be given to the speciﬁc circumstances under which it is acceptable to reuse data and the best way to balance potential risk and reward. Absent such consideration and clear guidelines, a secondary use—for social sci- ence research or other purposes—runs the risk of violating regulations, jeopardizing privacy, and de-legitimizing data initiatives by undermining citizen trust. Among the questions that need to be asked are what types of secondary use should be allowed (e.g., only with a clear public beneﬁt), who is permitted to reuse data, are there any types of data that should never be reused (e.g., medical data), and what framework can allow us to weigh the potential beneﬁts of unlocking data against the costs or risks (Verhulst et al., 2020a). The 2019 Finnish Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data is one policy model that effectively addresses these questions (Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, 2019). To tackle the challenge of purpose speciﬁcation in data reuse, new processes and notions of stakeholdership must be considered. For example, one emerging vehicle for balancing risk and opportunity is the use of working groups or symposia where thought leaders, public decision-makers, representatives of industry and civil society, and citizens come together to assess and help improve existing approaches and methodologies for data collaboration. 2 2.3.2 Data Anonymization and Re-identiﬁcation Data anonymization and/or de-identiﬁcation refers to the process by which a dataset is sanitized to remove or hide personally identiﬁable information with the goal of protecting individual privacy (OmniSci, n.d.-a). This process is key to maintaining personal privacy while also empowering actors to expand the ways in which data can be used without violating privacy and data protection laws. As anonymized data becomes more readily accessible and freely available, social scientists are working with large anonymized datasets to answer previously unanswerable questions. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, social scientists used mobile phone records and anonymized credit card purchases to understand how people’s movement and spending habits shifted in response to the pandemic across numerous sectors of the economy (“The Powers and Perils of Using Digital Data to Understand Human Behaviour”, 2021). In contrast to data anonymization, data re-identiﬁcation involves matching previously anonymized data with its original owners. The general ease of re- identiﬁcation means that the promised privacy of data anonymization is a weak 2 See, for example, the World Bank’s Open Data Working Group (https://data.worldbank.org/) or the British government’s Smart data working group (https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/ smart-data-working-group). 2 Computational Social Science for the Public Good: Towards a Taxonomy... 25 commitment and that data privacy laws must also be applied to anonymized data (Ghinita et al., 2009;Ohm, 2010; Rubinstein & Hartzog, 2015). One way to address the risk of re-identiﬁcation is to prevent the so-called mosaic effect (Czajka et al., 2014). This phenomenon occurs as a result of the re-identiﬁcation of data by combining multiple datasets containing similar or complementary information. The mosaic effect can pose a threat both to individual and group privacy (e.g., in the case of a small minority demographic group). Groups are frequently established through data analytics and segmentation choices (Mittelstadt, 2017). Under such conditions, individuals are often unaware that their data are being included in the context of a particular group, and decisions made on behalf of a group can limit data holders’ control and agency (Radaelli et al., 2018). Children’s data and humanitarian data are particularly susceptible to the challenges of group data (Berens et al., 2016; Young, 2020). Mitigation strategies include considering all possible points of intrusion, limiting analysis output details only to what is truly needed, and releasing aggregated information or graphs rather than granular data. In addition, limited access conditions can be established to protect datasets that could potentially be combined (Green et al., 2017). 2.3.3 Data Rights (Co-generated Data) and Sovereignty CSS research often leads not only to new data but new forms of data. In particular, the collaborative process involved in CSS often leads to co-generated or co-created data, processes which raise thorny questions about data rights, data sovereignty, and the very notion of “ownership” (Ducuing, 2020a, 2020b). Without a clear owner, traditional intellectual property laws are difﬁcult and often impossible to apply, which means that CSS may require new models of ownership and governance that promote data sharing and collaborative research while also protecting property rights (Micheli et al., 2020). In order to tackle the challenge of ownership and governance, stakeholders in the data space have proposed a number of potential models to replace traditional norms of ownership and property. These include adopting a more collective, rights-based approach to data ownership, creating public data repositories, and establishing private data cooperatives, data trusts, or data collaboratives. 3 Each of these methods has advantages and certain disadvantages, but they all go beyond the notion of co-ownership towards concepts of co-governance or co-regulation (Richet, 2021; Rubinstein, 2018). Such shared governance models could play a critical role in removing barriers to data and enabling the research potential of CSS. 3 For more information about types of data collaboratives, see “Leveraging Private Data for Public Good: A Descriptive Analysis and Typology of Existing Practices.” https://datacollaboratives.org/ existing-practices.html. 26 S.G. Verhulst 2.3.4 Barriers to Data Portability, Interoperability, and Platform Portability Data portability and data interoperability approach the same concept from two different actor perspectives. Data portability refers to the ability of individuals to reuse their personal data by moving it across different service platforms in a secure way (Information Commissioner’s Ofﬁce, n.d.). Data interoperability, on the other hand, allows systems to share and use data across platforms free of any restrictions (OmniSci, n.d.-b). More recently, certain observers have begun to point to the limitations of both these concepts, arguing instead for platform portability, which would, for example, allow consumers to transfer not only their personal data from one social media platform to another but also a broader set of data, including contact lists and other “rich” information (Hesse, 2021). Such concepts offer great potential for data sharing and more generally for the collaboration and access that are critical to enabling CSS. Yet a series of barriers exist, ranging from technical to regulatory to a general lack of trust among the public (De Hert et al., 2018; Vanberg & Ünver, 2017). Technical barriers are generally surmountable (Kadadi et al., 2014). Regulatory concerns, however, are thornier, with some scholars pointing out that provisions such as Article 20 of the GDPR, the right to data portability, could be interpreted to hamper cross-platform portability and create obstacles in building such partnerships (Hesse, 2021). There are also arguments that applying the new GDPR principles may prove more challenging for small and medium sized enterprises that may lack the resources and technology required to be effective (European Commission, 2020). Such restrictions are linked to a broader set of concerns over privacy and consent. Designed to protect consumer rights, they also have the inadvertent effect of restricting the potential of sharing and collaboration. Once again, they illustrate the difﬁcult challenges involved in balancing a desire to minimize risk while maximizing potential in the data ecosystem. 2.3.5 Data Ownership and Licensing As noted above, existing notions of data ownership and licensing pose a challenge due to the complex nature of ownership in the data ecosystem (Van Asbroeck, 2019). Traditional notions of ownership (and related concepts of copyright or IP licensing) convey a sense of non-rivalrous control over physical or virtual property. Yet data is more complicated as an entity; data about an individual is often not “owned” or controlled by that individual but rather by an entity—a company, a government organization—that has collected the data and that is now responsible for storing it, ensuring its quality and accuracy, and protecting the data from potential violations. Questions about ownership get even more complicated when we consider the nature of co-creation or co-generation (cf. above) or when we consider the data value chain, 2 Computational Social Science for the Public Good: Towards a Taxonomy... 27 by which data is repurposed and mingled with other data to generate new insights and forms of information (Van Asbroeck, 2019). For all these reasons, there have been calls for “more holistic” models and for a recognition of the “intersecting interests” that may deﬁne data ownership, particularly of personal information (Kerry & Morris, 2019; Nelson, 2017). The lack of conceptual and regulatory clarity over data ownership poses serious obstacles to the project of CSS (Balahur et al., 2010). It hinders data collaboration and sharing and prevents the inter-sectoral pooling of data and expertise that are so critical to conducting social science or other forms of research. In the absence of a more robust governance framework, research must often take place on the strength of ad hoc or trust-based relationships between parties—hardly a solid foundation upon which to scale CSS or harness its full potential. 2.4 Research Design Challenges 2.4.1 Injustice and Bias in Data and Algorithms Dataﬁcation—like technology in general—is often accompanied by claims of neutrality. Yet as society becomes increasingly dataﬁed, various forms of bias have emerged more clearly (Baeza-Yates, 2016). Bias can take many forms and present itself at various stages of the data value chain. There can be bias during the process of data collection or processing, as well as in the models or algorithms used to glean insights from datasets. Often, bias replicates existing social or political forms of exclusion. With the rise to prominence of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), considerable attention has been paid recently to the issue of algorithmic bias and bias in machine learning models (Krishnamurthy, 2019;Lu et al., 2019; Turner Lee et al., 2019). Bias can also arise from incomplete data that doesn’t necessarily replicate societal patterns but that is nonetheless unrepresentative and leads to ﬂawed or discriminatory outcomes. Moreover, biases are not limited to just the data but can also extend into interpretations affecting frames of reference, underlying assumptions and models of analysis to name a few (Jünger et al., 2022). Bias, in whatever form, poses serious challenges to CSS. One meta-analysis estimates that up to a third of studies using a method known as Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) may be afﬂicted by bias, one in ten “severely so” (Thiem et al., 2020). Such problems lead to insufﬁcient or incorrect conclusions; when translated into policy, they may result in harmful steps that perpetuate or amplify existing racial, gender, socioeconomic, and other forms of exclusion. Thus the issues posed by bias are deeply tied to questions of power and justice in society and represent some of the more serious challenges to effective, fair, and responsible CSS. 28 S.G. Verhulst 2.4.2 Data Accuracy and Quality Bias also is one of the main contributors to problems of data quality and accuracy. But these problems are multidimensional—i.e., they are caused by many factors— and inevitably represent a serious challenge to any project involving computational or data-led social studies. Exacerbating matters, the very notions of accuracy and, especially, quality are contested, with deﬁnitions and standards varying widely across projects, geographies, and legal jurisdictions. To an extent, the concept of accuracy can be simpliﬁed to a question about whether data is factually correct (facts, of course, are themselves contested). Quality is, however, a more nebulous concept, extending not only to the data itself but to various links in the data chain, including how the data was collected, stored, and processed (Dimitrova, 2021; Herrera & Kapur, 2007). In order to advance the ﬁeld of CSS, clearer deﬁnitions and standards will be required. While doing so, it will be critical to bring data subjects themselves into the conversations, in order to ensure a measure of participatory validation and ensure that any adopted standards have widespread buy-in. 2.4.3 Data Invisibles and Systemic Inequalities The concept of “data invisibles” refers to individuals who are outside the formal or digital economy and thus systematically excluded from the beneﬁts of that economy (Shuman & Paramita, 2016). Because many of these individuals are located in developing countries, many datasets or algorithmic models trained on such datasets systematically exclude non-Western citizens, gender invisibles, and countless other disadvantaged populations and minority groups and thus pose further challenges to the accuracy of CSS and its ﬁndings (D’Ignazio & Klein, 2018; Fisher & Streinz, 2021; Naudts, 2019;Neumayer et al., 2021). The problem of data invisibility is exacerbated by data governance practices that fail to proactively take into account the need for inclusion (D’Ignazio & Klein, 2018; Fisher & Streinz, 2021; Naudts, 2019;Neumayer et al., 2021). Such practices include insufﬁcient or non-existent guidelines or standards on data quality and representativeness; a lack of robust accountability and auditing mechanisms 4 for algorithms or machine learning models; and the demographic composition of research teams which often lack diversity or representation of those studied. Thus in order to strengthen the practice of CSS, it will be necessary to address the wider ecosystem of data governance. 4 See the Algorithmic Accountability Policy Toolkit, jointly developed by AI Now, the Ada Lovelace Institute and Open Government Partnership (https://ainowinstitute.org/pages/ algorithmic-accountability-for-the-public-sector-report.html). 2 Computational Social Science for the Public Good: Towards a Taxonomy... 29 2.5 Computational Structures and Processes Challenges 2.5.1 Human Computation, Collective Intelligence, and Exploitation Collective intelligence refers to the shared reasoning and insights that arises from our collective participation (both collaborative and competitive) in the data ecosys- tem (Figueroa & Pérez, 2018;Lévy, 2010). Collective intelligence has emerged as a potentially powerful tool in understanding our societies and in leading to more effective policies and offers tremendous potential for CSS. However, collective intelligence also faces a number of limitations that compromise the quality of its insights. These include bureaucratization that prevents lower-level actors from sharing their insights or expertise; the so-called “common knowledge” effect where participants do not strive to go beyond conventional wisdom and informational pressures which limit independent thoughts and actions. All of these challenges negatively impact collective intelligence and, indirectly, CSS. A further challenge emerging in this space, especially as collective intelligence intersects with AI, relates to the exploitation of machines, which may be co- participants in the process of collectively generated intelligence (Caverlee, 2013; Melo et al., 2016). Although this challenge remains more hypothetical than actual at the present, it raises complex ethical questions that could ultimately impact how research is conducted and who has the right to take credit (or blame) for its ﬁndings. 2.5.2 Need for Increased Computational Processing Power and Tackling Related Environmental Challenges The massive amounts of data available for social sciences research require equally massive amounts of computational processing power. This raises important ques- tions about equity and inclusion and also poses serious environmental challenges (Lazer et al., 2020). According to a recent study by Harvard’s John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, modern data centres already account for 1% of global energy consumption, a number that is rapidly increasing (Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 2021). The study points out that in addition to energy use, our data economy also contributes indirectly, for example, through e-waste, to pollution. Such problems are only likely to increase with the growing prominence of blockchain and the so-called Web3, which are already making their impact felt in the social sciences (Hurt, 2018). According to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, Bitcoin alone generates as much waste annually as the entire country of Holland. A single Bitcoin transaction uses a similar amount of energy as the consumption of an average US home over 64.61 days (“Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index”, n.d.). 30 S.G. Verhulst Computational processing requirements also pose serious obstacles to participa- tion by less developed countries or marginalized groups within developed countries, both of which may lack the necessary ﬁnancial and technical resources (Johnson, 2020). Such exclusion may lead, in turn, to unrepresentative or biased social science research and conclusions. One possible solution lies in developing new, less computationally demanding models to analyse data. Solutions of this nature have been developed, for instance, to analyse data from Instagram to monitor social media trends and for natural language processing algorithms that make it easier to process and derive insights from social media data (Pryzant et al., 2018; Riis et al., 2021). Another potential strategy is using volunteer computing, wherein a problem that would ordinarily require the computing power of a super computer is broken down and solved by thousands of volunteers with their personal computers (Toth et al., 2011). As volunteer computing grows in popularity, volunteer numbers must rapidly expand if this solution is to remain viable in the long run. These developments are just a start, but they represent efforts to address current limitations in processing power to help achieve more robust and equitable insights from CSS analyses. 2.6 Scientiﬁc Ecosystem Challenges 2.6.1 Domain, Computational, and Data Expertise: The Need for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Networks As the ﬁeld of CSS develops, the divide between domain, computational, and data expertise is emerging as a limiting factor. There is a pressing need for interdisciplinary collaboration networks to help bridge this divide and achieve more accurate insights and ﬁndings. For example, in order to effectively use large anonymized datasets on credit card purchases to understand shifts in spending patterns, a research team would need the combined expertise of data scientists, economists, sociologists, and anthropologists (relevant skill sets) “bilinguals” from around the world—practitioners across ﬁelds who possess both domain knowledge and data science expertise. One possible way to bridge this gap in CSS applications is by relying on “bilinguals” 5—scholars and professionals who possess expertise across domains and sectors (Porway, 2019). For example, these individuals can bring the requisite understanding of social sciences alongside strong data know-how required for CSS research. The valuable contribution of bilinguals is evident in the GovLab’s 100 Questions initiative, which seeks to identify the most pressing problems facing the world that can be answered by leveraging datasets in a responsible manner (“The 100 Questions Initiative—About”, n.d.). Each bilingual brings speciﬁc sector 5 “Bilinguals” refer to practitioners from the ﬁeld who possess domain-speciﬁc knowledge, as well as data science expertise. To learn more about bilinguals, visit https://the100questions.org/. 2 Computational Social Science for the Public Good: Towards a Taxonomy... 31 expertise coupled with a strong foundation in data science to draw out not only the most critical questions facing a domain but also to identify questions that can be answered using the current context of data (“The 100 Questions Initiative—About”, n.d.). In this way, interdisciplinary collaboration networks and bilinguals can help to bridge the knowledge gap that exists in the ﬁeld of CSS and to unlock deeper and more insightful outcomes with potentially deeper public impact. 2.6.2 Conﬂict of Interests, Corporate Funding, Data Donation Dependencies, and Other Ethical Limitations Conﬂicts of interest—real or perceived—are a major concern in all social studies research. Such conﬂicts can skew research results even when they are declared (Friedman & Richter, 2004). Many long-standing ethical concerns are relevant within the ﬁeld of CSS. These include issues related to funding, conﬂicts of interest (which may not be limited to ﬁnancial interests), and scope or type of work. Yet the use of data and emerging computational methods, for which ethical boundaries are often blurred, complicate matters and introduce new concerns. One recent study, for example, points to the difﬁculties in defence-sector work involving technology, highlighting “the code of ethics of social science organizations and their limits in dealing with ethical problems of new technologies” and “the need to develop an ethical imagination about technological advances and research and develop an appropriately supportive environment for promoting ethical behavior in the scientiﬁc community” (Goolsby, 2005). Such recommendations point to the shifting boundaries of ethics in a nascent and rapidly shifting ﬁeld. In addition to standard concerns over ﬁnancial conﬂicts of interest, CSS practi- tioners must also consider ethical concerns arising from non-ﬁnancial contributions, especially shared data. Data donations, for instance, can pose a challenge in terms of quality and transparency creating dependencies and vulnerabilities for the researchers using the data in their work, as was seen in Facebook’s Social Science One project (Timberg, 2021). In a collaborative landscape characterized by signiﬁcant reliance on corporate data, the sources of such data, as well as the motivations involved in sharing it, must be acknowledged, and their potential impact on research thoroughly considered. 2.6.3 The Failure of Reproducibility Reproducibility is a critical part of the scientiﬁc process, as it enables other researchers to verify or challenge the veracity of a study’s ﬁndings (Coveney et al., 2021). This ensures that high standards of research are maintained and that ﬁndings can be corroborated by multiple actors to strengthen their credibility. While the 32 S.G. Verhulst concept has long been used by the scientiﬁc community, it only recently began to enter the work of social studies and computational social scientists. The notion of reproducibility has generally been problematic in CSS due to the many difﬁculties— outlined above—when it comes to data sharing and open software agreements. A lack of transparency in computational research also further aggravates the challenge, making it extremely difﬁcult to implement the practices of reproducibility. In order to address this challenge, scholars have suggested the use of open trusted repositories as a potential solution (Stodden et al., 2016). Such repositories would enable researchers to share their data, software, and other details of their work in a secure manner to encourage collaboration and reproducibility without compromising the integrity of the original researcher’s work. More generally, a stronger culture of collaboration in the ecosystem would also help increase the adoption of reproducibility, which would be to the beneﬁt of computational sciences as a whole (Kedron et al., 2021). 2.7 Societal Impact Challenges 2.7.1 Need for Citizen/Community Engagement and Acquiring a Social License Trust has emerged as a major issue in the data ecosystem. In order for CSS research to be successful, it requires buy-in from citizens and communities. This is particularly true given the heavy reliance on data sharing, which requires trust and a trust-building culture to sustain the required inter-sectoral collaboration. For instance, a 2012 “Manifesto of Computational Social Science”, published in the European Physical Journal, emphasizes the importance of involving citizens in gathering data and of “enhancing citizen participation in [the] decision process” (Conte et al., 2012). In pursuit of such goals, CSS can borrow from the existing methodology of “Citizen Science”, which highlights the role of community participation in various stages of social sciences research (Albert et al., 2021). Citizen Science methods can be adapted for—and in some cases strengthened by—the era of big data. New and emerging methods include crowdsourcing through citizen involvement in data gathering (e.g., through the IoT and other sensors); collaborative decision-making processes facilitated by technology that involve a greater range of stakeholders; and technologies to harness the distributed intelligence or expertise of citizens. Recently, some social scientists have also relied on so-called pop-up experiments (or PUEs), deﬁned by one set of Spanish researchers as “physical, light, very ﬂexible, highly adaptable, reproducible, transportable, tuneable, collective, participatory and public experimental set-up for urban contexts” (Sagarra et al., 2016). Indeed, urban settings have proven particularly fertile ground for such methodological innovations, given the density of citizens and data-generating devices. 2 Computational Social Science for the Public Good: Towards a Taxonomy... 33 2.7.2 Lack of Data Literacy and Agency A lack of public understanding of data and data governance means that the public faces considerable risk associated with mismanagement of their data and exploitative data practices. This is particularly the case given that the current data ecosystem is largely dominated by corporate actors, who control access to large amounts of personal data and may use the data for their gain (Micheli et al., 2020). In order to address the associated inequalities and power asymmetries and to begin democratizing the data ecosystem, data governance methods must improve. Legislation such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a step in the right direction. In addition to legislative change, the development of data sharing infrastructures and the involvement of government and third sector actors in data collaborations with private actors will help mitigate the challenges of weak data literacy and agency among the public. A lack of data literacy and agency have both ethical and practical implications for CSS (Chen et al., 2021; Pryzant et al., 2018; Sokol & Flach, 2020). In the context of data, agency refers to the power to make decisions about where and how one’s data is used. Without sufﬁcient awareness and agency, it is hard not only for individuals to meaningfully consent to their data being used but also for researchers to effectively and responsibly collect and use data for their studies. Moreover, a lack of data literacy and agency makes it difﬁcult for citizens and others to interpret the results of a study or to implement policy and other concrete steps informed by CSS research. For CSS to achieve its potential, a stronger foundation of data literacy and an understanding of agency will be crucial both among the general public and among key decision-makers. 2.7.3 Computational Solutionism and Determinism Determinism has a long and problematic history in the social sciences, with concerns historically raised about overly prescriptive or simplistic explanatory frameworks and models for human and social behaviour (Richardson & Bishop, 2002). CSS holds the potential both to improve upon such difﬁculties and to exacer- bate them. The intersection of “technological determinism” and the social sciences is particularly grounds for wariness; any attempt to derive social explanations from technical phenomena must resist the temptation to construct overly deterministic or linear explanations. Models based on unrepresentative or otherwise ﬂawed datasets (as described above) similarly risk ﬂawed solutions and policy interventions. At the same time, Big Data offers the theoretical potential at least for richer and more complete empirical frameworks. Some have gone so far as to suggest that the interaction of Big Data and the social sciences could spell the “end of theory”, offering social scientists a less deterministic and hypothetical framework through which to approach the world (Kitchin, 2014). CSS also offers the potential of more 34 S.G. Verhulst realistic and complex simulations that can help social scientists and policymakers understand phenomena as well as potential outcomes of interventions (Tolk et al., 2018). For such visions to become a reality, however, the challenges posed to collaboration and sharing—many discussed in this paper—need to be mitigated. 2.7.4 Computational/Data Surveillance and the Risk of Exploitation The ﬁnal societal impact challenge associated with CSS pertains to the risk of computational and data surveillance (Tufekci, 2014). Considerable concern already exists over the data insights that drive targeted advertising, personalized social media content and disinformation, and more. We live, as Shoshana Zuboff has famously observed, in a “surveillance economy” (Zuboff, 2019). This economy creates challenges related to misinformation and polarization, and it is a direct result of companies’ ability to exploit the wealth of data they hold on their users. While the potential beneﬁts of CSS are manifold, there is also a risk of new forms of exploitation and manipulation, based on new insights and new forms of data (Caled & Silva, 2021). Each case of exploitation has a direct result and also further erodes trust in the broader ecosystem. The only solution is a series of actions—legislative and otherwise—aimed at encouraging responsible data-driven research and CSS. Many potential actions are outlined in this paper. Further research is needed to ﬂesh out some of the proposals and to develop new ones. To tackle this challenge, new legislation addressing the uses of data and Computational Social Science analyses will be critical. 2.8 Reﬂections and Conclusion The intersection of big data, advanced computational tools, and the social sciences is now well established among researchers and policymakers around the world. The potential for dramatic and perhaps even revolutionary insights and impact are clear. But as this paper—and others in this volume—shows, many hurdles remain to achieving that potential. The priority, therefore, is not simply to ﬁnd ways to leverage data in the pursuit of research but, equally or more importantly, to innovate in how we govern the use of data for the social sciences. An effective governance framework needs to be multi-tentacled. It would cover the broader ecologies of data, technology, science, and social science. It would address how data is collected and shared and also how research is conducted and transferred into insights and ultimately impact. It would also seek to promote the adoption of more robust data literacy and skills standards and programs. The above touches upon a number of speciﬁc suggestions, some of which we hope 2 Computational Social Science for the Public Good: Towards a Taxonomy... 35 to expand upon in future research or writing projects. Elements of a responsible governance framework include the need to foster interdisciplinary collaboration; more fairly distribute computational power and technical and ﬁnancial resources; rethink our notions of ownership and data rights; address misaligned incentives and misunderstood aspects of data reuse and collaboration; and ensure better quality data and representation. Last but not least, a responsible governance framework ought to develop a new research agenda in alignment with emerging concepts and concerns from the data ecosystem. Perhaps the most urgent priority is the need to gain (or regain) a social license for the reuse of data in the pursuit of social and scientiﬁc knowledge. A social license to operate refers to the public acceptance of business practices or operating procedures used by a speciﬁc organization or industry (Kenton, 2021). In recent years the tremendous potential of data sharing and collaboration has been somewhat clouded by rising anxiety over misuses of data, with the resulting privacy and surveillance violations. These risks are very real, as are the resulting harms to individual and community rights. They have eroded the trust of the public and policymakers in data and data collaboration and undermined the possibilities offered by data sharing and CSS. The solution, however, is not to pull away. Rather, we must strengthen the governance framework—and wider norms—within which data reuse and data- driven research take place. This paper represents an initial gesture in that direction. By identifying problems, we hope to take steps towards solutions. References Albert, A., Balázs, B., Butkeviˇcien˙e, E., Mayer, K., & Perelló, J. (2021).

Chapter 3 Data Justice, Computational Social Science and Policy Linnet Taylor Abstract Big data has increased attention to Computational Social Science (CSS) on the part of policymakers because it has the power to make populations, activities and behaviour visible in ways that were not previously possible. This kind of analysis, however, often has unforeseen implications for those who are the subjects of the research. This chapter asks what a social justice perspective can tell us about the potential, and the risks, of this kind of analysis when it is oriented towards informing policy. Who beneﬁts, and how, when computational methods and new data sources are used to conduct policy-relevant analysis? Should CSS sidestep, through its novelty and its identiﬁcation with computational and statistical methodologies, sidestep ethical review and the assessments of power asymmetries and methodological justiﬁcation that are common in social science research? If not, how should these be applied to CSS research, and what kind of assessment is appropriate? The analysis offers two main conclusions: ﬁrst, that the ﬁeld of CSS has evolved without an accompanying evolution of debates on ethics and justice and that these debates are long overdue. Second, that CSS is privileged as policy-relevant research precisely because of many of the features which bring up concerns about justice—large-scale datasets, remote data gathering, purely quantitative methods and an orientation towards policy questions rather than the needs of the research subjects. 3.1 Introduction The rise of Computational Social Science (hereafter CSS) over the last decades has become mingled with the rise of big data, and more recently with that of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and the automated processing of data on an enormous scale. New applications and uses of data arose with the advent of new data sources L.

Taylor over the 2000s, and especially the rise of mobile phones and mobile connectivity in most countries of the world. The following decade has borne out many of the predictions that were made when big data was ﬁrst conceptualised—that it would make populations, activities and behaviour visible in ways that had not previously been possible and that this would have huge impacts on both analysis and intervention across a range of ﬁelds, from urban policy to epidemiology and from international development to humanitarian intervention. This chapter examines the use of CSS in relation to national and international policy issues and asks who beneﬁts, and how, when computational methods and new data sources are used to conduct policy-relevant analysis. What few commentators on big data forecasted was the extent to which big data would represent a private sector revolution (Taylor & Broeders, 2015). The step change in volume, immediacy and power constituted by the new sources of large-scale data did not stem from bureaucratic or academic innovation, but from changes in the commercial world driven by new devices and massive investments in software, hardware and infrastructure. Despite the United Nations’ call in 2014 (United Nations, 2014) to use data for the public good, the potential of the new data sources to make people visible and to inform intervention has been led primarily by commercial ﬁrms, with policy as a secondary user of what is still largely commercial data. The proprietary nature of much of the data used in CSS is important because it determines what information becomes available and to whom and what kind of analysis and intervention it can inform. It also, as predicted more than a decade ago, creates hierarchies amongst researchers and institutions, since access to data is a privilege to be negotiated (boyd & Crawford, 2012). This has meant that so far the CSS ﬁeld has been mainly populated by high-status researchers from well- funded institutions in high-income countries, who also tend to be male, white and connected to the well-funded academic disciplines of computer science, quantitative sociology and statistics or to policy interests that tend towards security, population management and economic development. One example of the increasing hybridisation in the way data is sourced between commercial, international organisations and governments is the case of the ‘Premise’ app.1 Developed in Silicon Valley, Premise is a crowdsourcing survey app that pays people small amounts to photograph or report features of their surroundings, from cash machines and construction sites to food prices. Initially marketed as a tool for international development agencies to remotely source information, it then became a tool for businesses to assess market possibilities and competition. It next morphed into a way for intelligence services to collect data covertly, with tasks offered such as photographing the locations of Shiite mosques in Kabul (Tau, 2021). As the case of Premise suggests, data is not neutral. Unless we understand who it reﬂects and how it was sourced, there is the potential for harm to what Metcalf and Crawford have termed the ‘downstream subjects of research’ (Metcalf & Crawford, 1 See https://www.premise.com/contributors/. 3 Data Justice, Computational Social Science and Policy 43 2016). Understanding data gathered remotely also poses epistemological problems: without domain and local knowledge to convey ground truth (Dalton et al., 2016), not only its analysis but any interventions it informs are likely to be ﬂawed and unreliable. Digitally informed analysis and intervention also raise issues of power and justice given that powerful interests drive its collection and use. Social data is always attached to people. Analysis often obscures that connection, but it remains throughout the lifecycle of bits and bytes, from information to intervention and evaluation. Despite its usually explicit aim to have effects on people, Computational Social Science is not, however, subject to the kind of review process that is normal for other research on human subjects. One reason may be that it is designed to inform intervention, but it is not so far classiﬁed as constituting intervention itself. This places it in a different category to biomedical research, which is governed through an infrastructure for ethical review at the European, governmental and institutional level (EUREC, 2021). It also tends to escape review within academic institutions because CSS usually does not become registered as social scientiﬁc research unless a project lead is employed by a social science faculty. Due to their technical demands, many CSS projects originate in computer science, economics or data science departments and institutes. On the European level, CSS projects undergo an ethics check if the principal investigator ﬂags them at the application stage as using personal data—which may not happen in many cases due to the deﬁnitional problem outlined by Metcalf and Crawford (2016). If they do go through review by the European Research Council’s ethics committee, they are reviewed for data protection compliance and for classic research ethics issues such as beneﬁt- sharing, but as explored later in this chapter, this may not capture important ethical challenges relating to CSS, particularly where the beneﬁts are deﬁned as relating to policy. 3.2 Background: Computational Social Science and Data Justice The central aim of using large-scale data and Computational Social Science methods to inform policy is to positively impact society. This aim, however, comes with no deﬁnition of which people should beneﬁt and whether those are the same people who are reﬂected in the data. The unevenness of the new large-scale data sources, their representativeness and their potential for uneven effects when used in policy, therefore, are central concerns for any researcher or policymaker interested in not doing harm. Over the 2010s ﬁrst the ﬁeld of critical data studies and, later, the related ﬁeld of data justice have taken up these issues methodologically and theoretically. These ﬁelds have roots in digital geography, charting how epistemologies of big data (Kitchin, 2014) differ from previous ways of seeing the world through statistics and 44 L. Taylor administrative accounts and how the geography of where and how data is sourced determines whose truth it can tell us (Dalton et al., 2016). They are sceptical of the claims of granularity and representativeness often made about large-scale data, a scepticism also present in the post-colonial strand of critique which has shown how the dataﬁed representation of populations, cities and movement is always ﬁltered through narratives of entrepreneurialism, innovation and modernity, which shape both the starting point and the uses of such analyses (Couldry & Mejias, 2019; Datta & Odendaal, 2019). Similar critiques can be found in sociological research, which take issue with the idea that data can ever be neutral or raw (Gitelman, 2013) and which also expose the underlying ideology of what van Dijck calls ‘dataism’: a widespread belief in the objective quantiﬁcation and potential tracking of all kinds of human behavior and sociality through online media technologies. Besides, dataism also involves trust in the (institutional) agents that collect, interpret, and share (meta)data culled from social media, internet platforms, and other communication technologies. (Van Dijck, 2014, p. 198) Where all these accounts cumulatively tend is towards a statement that not only is big data applied to policy issues not as granular or omniscient as the hype of the early 2010s promised it would be, but that far from being objective, it is fundamentally shaped by the assumptions and standpoint of all the actors (many of them commercial) controlling its trajectory from creation to analysis and use. Not only are the questions asked of data usually oriented towards the needs and perspectives of the most powerful (Taylor & Meissner, 2020), but the data itself is generated, collected and shared in ways that reﬂect and conﬁrm the status quo in terms of resource distribution, visibility and agency. As AI increasingly becomes an important part of data’s potential lifecycle, with data used to train, parameterise and feed models for business and policy, this dynamic where data reﬂects existing power and its interests becomes magniﬁed. Data is now not only useful for making visible the behaviour and movement of populations, it is useful for optimising them. Correspondingly, any lack of representativeness or understanding of the interests and dynamics the data reﬂects are translated in this move from modelling to optimising into a direct shaping of subjects’ opportunities and possibilities (Kulynych et al., 2020). Research on these issues of justice has been done in disciplines ranging from computer science (Philip et al., 2012) and information science (Heeks, 2017)to development studies (Taylor, 2017) and media studies (Dencik et al., 2016)and is increasingly affecting how regulators think about the data economy (Slaughter, 2021). How research, and speciﬁcally policy-relevant research conducted under the heading of Computational Social Science, intersects with this problem of data justice is the focus of this chapter. The questions that arise from CSS are not conﬁned to data itself or to scientiﬁc or policy research methods. Instead, they span issues of democratic decision-making, representative government, the governance of data in general and social justice concerns of recognition, representation and redistribution. As Gangadharan and Niklas have argued (2019), doing justice to the 3 Data Justice, Computational Social Science and Policy 45 subjects of dataﬁcation and dataﬁed policy often implies decentring the technology and being less exceptionalist about data. 3.3 Questions and Challenges It is possible to group the justice-related issues outlined above around two poles: the effects of CSS on those who use the data and its effects on those whom the data represents. The ﬁrst deals with how data confers new forms of power on the already powerful through their access not only to data itself but also resources, computing infrastructures and policy attention. The second relates to the way in which making people visible to policy does not automatically beneﬁt them and may instead either amplify existing problems or create entirely new ones, while the remote nature of the research decreases people’s agency in relation to policy and decision-making. CSS methods, and the data that fuels them, frequently confer on researchers the power to make social phenomena visible at the aggregate level and continuously— people’s behaviour, whereabouts, activities and histories—and on policymakers the power to intervene in new ways. The optimisation of social systems and its policy predecessors, nudging and governance through statistics, are all ways of intervening that rely on detailed quantitative data. Computational Social Science demonstrates the tendency of this dataﬁed power to be unbalanced in its distribution, favouring those with the resources, infrastructure and power to gather and use data effectively. Like all social science, it involves a power relation between the researcher and the subject, but in the case of CSS, that subject can be an entire population. Large-scale data conveys the power to intervene but also the power to deﬁne problems in the ﬁrst place: what Pentland has termed ‘the god’s eye view’ (Pentland, 2010) brings with it little accountability. A justice perspective, above all, asks what would shape the power conferred by data towards the public interest. Adding a governance perspective means we should also consider how the negative possibilities of dataﬁed power can be systematically identiﬁed and controlled. Computational Social Science, speciﬁcally where it has the aim of informing policy, is a relevant ﬁeld in which to ask these questions for two reasons. First, because the ways in which it accesses data, analyses it and uses it to intervene opaque to the public, taking place in the realm of large producers of data and high-level policymakers. This has meant that CSS has so far been relatively invisible to the kind of ethical or justice-based critiques which have arisen around AI and machine learning over the recent period. Second, we should interrogate it because it increasingly has real and large-scale effects on populations, either local or distant, once translated into policy information. 46 L. Taylor 3.3.1 Who Beneﬁts? The issue of the distribution of beneﬁts from CSS is both discursive and contested. Discursive because as with all scientiﬁc disciplines, there is an argument that fundamental research is justiﬁed by the search for knowledge alone, but this is counterbalanced by the responsibility that research on human subjects brings with it. CSS has not so far been categorised as human subject research because, despite its connection to policy and the shaping of social processes, data is collected remotely and the human subjects are not directly connected to the research. This means that CSS research has not so far been subject to the same ethical review process as human subject research, where researchers must explain how any beneﬁts of their research will be distributed. The question is also contested because human subjects of the research, given the chance, will often have very different understandings of what constitute beneﬁts. For example, starting from the assumption that data exists and must therefore be used (Taylor, 2016) is problematic because it addresses data about society as ‘terra nullius’ (Couldry & Mejias, 2019), a raw resource which exists independently of the people it reﬂects. In contrast, the subjects of the research (city dwellers, migrants, workers, the subjects of development intervention and others) may disagree that this is true. The ‘terra nullius’ assumption has also been undermined by work on group privacy (Taylor et al., 2017), which argues that data which facilitates intervention upon people—whether personal data or not— raises the question of when it is justiﬁed to shape and optimise behaviour or social conditions. Given that CSS is usually conducted on remote subjects with only the consent of the intermediaries holding the data, this means its legitimacy is usually based on the interests of those intermediaries and the researchers, not the subjects of research themselves (Taylor, 2021). To offer an example, data stemming from refugees’ use of mobile phones was made available by the Turkish national mobile network operator and used remotely by computational social scientists in the Data for Refugees challenge (2019).2 One group built a model that could identify where people were working informally— something 99% of Syrian refugees in Turkey were doing at the time due to lack of employment permission. The authors explain their logic for conducting the study: Refugees don’t normally have permission to work and only have access to informal employment. Our results not only provided country-wide statistics of employment but also gave a detailed breakdown of employment characteristics via heatmaps across Turkey. This information is valuable since it would allow GOs and NGOs to reﬁne and target appropriate policy to generate opportunities and economic integration as well as social mobility speciﬁc to each area of Turkey. (Reece et al., 2019,p.13) It is possible to contest this, however. The fact that Turkey was legally restricting the right of refugees to internal mobility and employment—which the authors note many other countries also do—does not mean that this is in line with international 2 For more on the challenge, see https://datapopalliance.org/publications/data-for-refugees-the- d4r-challenge-on-mobility-of-syrian-refugees-in-turkey/. 3 Data Justice, Computational Social Science and Policy 47 human rights law (International Justice Resource Center, 2012). It is doubtful that the Syrians in the dataset would ﬁnd that creating a way to make visible their mobility and informal employment was in their own interests. The authors’ claim that their model allows government and non-governmental organisations to target policy, generate opportunities and economic integration and help refugees become socially mobile rests on the optimistic assumption that these organisations are incentivised to do so. An alternate and more likely result would be that the model would facilitate the authorities’ ability to constrain refugees’ ability to move and work, an incentive already present in Turkish law. Whose interests does this analysis serve, then? First, the Turkish government, since the model can help enforce a national law against refugees’ moving and working freely. It may be in the interests of NGOs wishing to help refugees, but given the Turkish regime’s laws targeting organisations that do so (Deutsche Welle, 2020), it is unlikely. The national telecom provider is a potential beneﬁciary in terms of positive publicity and potentially governmental approval if the authoritarian government of Turkey sees the researchers’ analysis of the data as being useful for its governance of refugee populations. Lastly, the researchers themselves beneﬁt in the form of access to data and ensuing publications. And so we can chart how analysis that claims to be ‘Data for Refugees’ may in fact be data for government, data for telecom providers and data for academic researchers. Scholars of data governance have debated the problem of determining interests in, and rights over, data once it enters the public sphere. These include public data commons and data trusts (Micheli et al., 2020), both of which appear at ﬁrst sight ideal for protecting the rights of data subjects. These approaches are promising under conditions where data is moving within the same jurisdiction (local, national or regional) in which it was created and where there is a ﬁduciary capable of representing the interests of the people reﬂected in the data (Delacroix & Lawrence, 2019). In the case of cross-border transfers of data for scientiﬁc research, however, this chain is often broken at the starting point. In the case (common in CSS) of mobile data on non-European populations, the data is de-identiﬁed and aggregated by the mobile network provider (Taylor, 2016) before it is made available for analysis, placing the network provider in the position of ﬁduciary. Creating a different ﬁduciary would in the case explored above mean empowering someone to represent the interests of all Syrian refugees in Turkey. This hints at several problems: can a ﬁduciary from a group in a situation of extraordinary vulnerability be expected to have the power to protect that group’s interests? What happens when the group in question has, as in this case, a limited set of enforceable rights compared to everyone else with an interest in the data? For example, are the claims of the Western CSS community likely to be effectively contested by a population of refugees primarily engaged with their own survival? It is easy to see how, in cases where people within a population of interest is not able to assert their rights, even ﬁduciary arrangements quickly come to represent an idea of the public good that may not align with that group’s own ideas—if such a diverse group agrees on what is in its interests in the ﬁrst place. 48 L. Taylor This case illustrates that, given that the stakes for refugees in being monitored and intervened upon are extraordinarily high, and the CSS in this case actively creates new vulnerabilities, it seems more attention should be given to how far ﬁduciary- based models can stretch. In situations of radical power asymmetry, it is not clear that the ﬁduciary model necessarily leads to the legitimate use of data for research. In fact, drawing on discussions of indigenous data sovereignty, it is clear that in the case of people in situations of vulnerability, a model based on the assumption that data will be shared and reused may not be appropriate (Rainie et al., 2019). As indigenous scholars point out (Simpson, 2017), if refusal is not an option on the table for those who have been made vulnerable, further ideas about governance cease to be ethical choices. 3.3.2 Making People Visible: Surveillance as Social Science Data sourced from platforms, large-scale administrative data from public services or data from monitoring of public space are, in their different ways, all forms of surveillance. They are often quite intimate, drawing a picture of how people use city space or move across borders, how they break rules and create informal ways to support their families in emergency situations and how they catch and pass on infectious diseases, spend their money, interact with each other and use public services. Human activity everywhere is becoming dataﬁed, sometimes with people’s knowledge as they engage with platforms and online services, but often without their awareness as they are captured by CCTV, satellites, mobile phone network infrastructures, apps or payment services. Increasingly, these forms of surveillance intersect and feed into each other. Urban space has become securitised through the availability of CCTV and mobile phone data, just as borders have become securitised through satellite surveillance and geospatial sensing. But all these sensing technologies are dual use—either in their potential or in their actual usage by authorities. Urban crowd sensing systems, relying on mobile phone location data and social media analysis, were ﬁrst created as a way to keep track of crowding during public events and then repurposed to help enforce pandemic public health measures. These functions also, however, support police and security services by showing how public protests evolve, by helping track how people move to and from locations authorities wish to control and by making it possible to identify protesters in real time—something law enforcement used to chilling effect during the Hong Kong protests of 2019–2020 (Zalnieriute, 2021). Border enforcement activities have also become an important target for Compu- tational Social Science methods. In 2019 the European Asylum Support Ofﬁce was warned by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS, 2019) that conducting social media analysis of groups assumed to be potential migrants in Africa, with the aim of tracking migration ﬂows towards the EU’s borders, was illegal under European data protection law. This was a project the Asylum Support Ofﬁce had inherited from the United Nations, which had been developing Computa- 3 Data Justice, Computational Social Science and Policy 49 tional Social Science methods with big data for nearly a decade (Taylor, 2016) using methods developed in collaboration with academic Computational Social Science researchers. Similarly, epidemiological surveillance has a long history of constructing models that show how people move across borders, ﬁrst in relation to malaria and later dengue and Ebola (Pindolia et al., 2012;Wesolowski et al., 2014). These methods were co-designed and then separately developed by mobility researchers over the 2010s, culminating in the use of mobile phone connectivity for tracking infections (and people’s movement in general) during the COVID-19 pandemic (Ferretti et al., 2020). Mobile data in particular can inform many forms of monitoring, from policing borders to political protests, with methods shared between humanitarian technologists, public health specialists, security services and law enforcement. These interactions between different forms of surveillance suggest two con- clusions: ﬁrst, that an innocuous history and set of uses can always be claimed for any methodology involving surveillance-derived data and, second, that the reverse is also true—all methods and types of data intersect at some point in the data’s lifecycle with uses that potentially or actually violate the right to protest anonymously, to move freely, to work, to self-determination and many other rights and entitlements. A justice-based approach illuminates these interactions rather than seeking the innocuous explanations and follows data and methods through their lifecycles to ﬁnd the points where they generate injustice by rendering people visible in ways that are damaging to their rights and freedoms. Much of this discussion comes down to the question of who has the right to derive policy-relevant conclusions from data, under what circumstances and on whose behalf. It is not a simple question: should people ‘own’ data about them (something that is not present in data protection law, or any other, which only confer rights over data to people under some speciﬁc circumstances in order to protect from harm), or should the makers and managers of data be free to use it in line with whatever they conceive to be the public beneﬁt? The issue seems mainly to revolve around how the public beneﬁt will be agreed upon, rather than who has the right to data per se. Forced migrants in particular but also those suffering marginalisation or disadvantage of any kind may be generating information that is important not only to them, but also to others—on environmental change, conﬂicts and humanitarian crises, for example, not to mention living conditions in cities and the adequate provision of public services such as education and transport. What should we say about the shared interests in data that can illuminate problems and inform change? This is partly a question for democratic discussion—something that has not been well conceptualised so far. It is also, however, a normative question that the EU needs to ﬁnd a preliminary answer to in order to make possible such a debate. One suggestion from work on data justice is that the normative framing tends to be that of economic growth and technical advancement, whereas an alternative but valid one is that of the good of the groups involved in the data. If the starting point for analysis is the interests of those groups, this demands not only different ways of analysing the ethics of a particular research project or policy advice process but also that democratic processes be set up for determining the interests of the groups 50 L. Taylor in question (Taylor & De Souza, 2021). This becomes a much broader issue of decolonising international relations, reframing the allocation of fundamental rights so that they cover people, for instance, on both sides of the EU’s border, and treating people who are in conditions of conﬂict, forced migration or other precarious situation as if they are the same kind of legal subject as more empowered and vocal research subjects in easier conditions. 3.4 Addressing Justice Concerns: Ethics, Regulation and Governance The potential and actual justice problems for CSS outlined above are frequently seen as problems of research ethics. If researchers can comply with data protection provisions, the logic goes, they will not violate the rights of those the data reﬂects. Similarly, if research ethics are followed—again, mainly focusing on the privacy and conﬁdentiality of research data because consent tends to come from the intermediaries offering the data—the subjects of the research will be protected. Both the data protection-compliance and research ethics/privacy approaches, however, are necessary but insufﬁcient to address the justice concerns that arise from CSS methods and the ways in which they inform policy. As the EDPS’ warning to the Asylum Support Ofﬁce states, the problems caused by remote analysis of data on unaware and often vulnerable populations are not solved by preventing the identiﬁcation of individual research subjects. In its letter the data protection supervisor’s ofﬁce notes that ‘EASO accesses open source info, manually looks at groups and produces reports, which according to them no longer contain personal data’ and that ‘EASO’s monitoring activities subject them to enhanced surveillance due to the mere fact that they are or might become migrants or asylum seekers’. Both these statements accurately describe much of CSS research, hence the relevance of this example. The EDPS names two risks: possible inaccuracy in identifying groups (not individuals) who might attempt to cross borders irregularly—something with potentially serious consequences for the people involved—and the risk of discrimination against those people. The EDPS quotes theory on group privacy, noting ‘the risk of group discrimination, i.e. a situation in which inferences drawn from SMM [social media monitoring] can conceivably put a group, as group, at risk, in a way that cannot be covered by ensuring each member’s control over their individual data’ (EDPS, 2019)(the EDPS also notes, however, that the likelihood of such individuals knowing their data is being used in this way and ‘controlling’ it is vanishingly small). The EDPS’ analysis of this problem merits serious consideration by CSS researchers, given that it overturns a generation of research ethics based on preserv- ing the individual privacy and conﬁdentiality of research subjects. If we shift the focus from the individual in the dataset—who will often be de-identiﬁed anyway— to the consequences of the analysis, a whole different set of concerns opens up, 3 Data Justice, Computational Social Science and Policy 51 namely, those of rights violations, discrimination and illegitimate intervention on the collective level. In this scenario, it is not enough for researchers to claim that they are merely performing social scientiﬁc analysis and that the potential policy uses of their work are not their responsibility. CSS is intimately connected to policy through a history of providing ﬁndings on public health, migration dynamics, economic development, urban planning, labour market dynamics and a myriad other areas which connect directly to policy uses. It is not clear how to govern CSS research so that research ethics is not violated. As experts have pointed out, research ethics practices, and the academic infrastructure of checks and balances that enforce it, urgently require updating for the era of big data research (Metcalf & Crawford, 2016). Given that the ﬁeld of CSS does not conceptualise itself as ‘human subjects research’, researchers are not incentivised either to conceptualise the downstream effects on whole populations or to weigh the justiﬁcation for those effects. Instead they are strongly incentivised to make general statements about how their research will beneﬁt society or institutions, without acknowledging that those beneﬁts come with costs to others, most often the subjects of the research themselves. This lack of alignment between research ethics and much of CSS research does not justify proceeding with business as usual. Instead it sets a challenge to both CSS researchers and the policymakers who use their ﬁndings: to place real checks and balances on what research can be done, with processes involving both domain knowledge and rights expertise, and to undertake concentrated work to identify the ways in which projects may create or amplify injustice. Only by doing so can the acceptability and normality of doing unacknowledged dual-purpose research be countered. This is particularly important given that data’s availability will potentially become much greater over the 2020s. New models for data sharing such as those outlined in the EU’s data governance act (European Commission, 2020)are designed to contribute to the availability of data for both CSS and AI, both redeﬁning ‘public’ data as data with possible public uses and setting broader parameters for sharing it between business, government and research. These new models also include new intermediaries to ensure that ‘altruistic data sharing’ can occur without friction. Once enacted, this vastly greater legal and technical infrastructure will increase the interactions between the public and private sectors, allowing research to more comprehensively inform policy and business. It is likely the line between the two will increasingly blur, as governmental and EU research funding continues to be oriented towards serving business and the EU’s economic agenda. It is likely that this blurring of boundaries between the commercial and research worlds will also lead to more policy-relevant research in terms of inﬂuencing social behaviour, just as nudging both inherited methods from and contributed to marketing research over the 2000s (Baldwin, 2014). Such a merging of commercial and governmental surveillance and analytical methodologies has already occurred: the Snowden revelations of 2014 (Lyon, 2014) revealed that security surveillance was already based on scanning behavioural and social media data and that it was conducted not by native security technicians but by commercial contractors. More recently the work of the Data Justice Lab in Cardiff, for example, has demonstrated 52 L. Taylor that citizen scoring has transitioned from a commercial to a governmental practice, with the two connected by common methodologies and analytical practices (Dencik et al., 2018). 3.5 The Way Forward The analysis in this chapter offers two main conclusions: First, that the ﬁeld of CSS has evolved without an accompanying evolution of debates on ethics and justice and that these debates are long overdue. Second, that CSS is privileged as policy-relevant research precisely because of many of the features which bring up concerns about justice—large-scale datasets, remote data gathering, purely quantitative methods and an orientation towards policy questions rather than the needs of the research subjects. The hype that has accompanied the discovery of new data sources and new ways of applying statistical methodologies to very large-scale data has frequently eclipsed the question of when doing such analysis is justiﬁed and whether the beneﬁts it may create are proportionate to the costs of making people and their activities visible to new (policy) actors. Migration data offers a key lesson here: computational collection and analysis of large-scale data does not aim at identifying individuals and is therefore considered by its practitioners not to be problematic. However, when practised with the aim of providing an ‘early warning system’ for the approach of irregular migrants to the EU’s borders, it has the potential to violate fundamental human rights, both in the form of discrimination and by narrowing the right to claim asylum. Similarly, building models to identify those working irregularly in refugee receiving states may be welcomed by state authorities and by the statistical methods community, but does not represent a contribution to the care and wellbeing of the refugees in question. Once such a model exists, the researcher cannot unpublish it—it is open to the use of anyone with access to the relevant type of data. The responsibility in this case is squarely with the researcher, but accountability is absent. One step, therefore—if the ﬁeld of CSS and the policymakers it informs wish to move towards a justice-based approach—is to subject all CSS studies involving data on people and informing any kind of intervention, to the same kind of ethical review that is performed on standard social scientiﬁc research projects involving human subjects. This is not enough on its own, however: that ethical review has to also respond to concerns about proportionality, fairness and the appropriateness of the methods to the question, regardless of whether the research is remote or in-person. The examples offered in this chapter suggest that it is time to update research ethics to cover the ﬁelds and methods involved in big data and that this is also a concern for policymakers interested in aligning their work with human rights. Demand from CSS researchers and policymakers could provide the necessary stimulus to update academic research review for the 2020s and align checks and balances with contemporary research practices. 3 Data Justice, Computational Social Science and Policy 53 A second concern is that CSS is rarely, if ever, performed in circumstances where the individuals implicated by the research either inﬂuence the questions asked or have access to the conclusions. A notable exception is ‘citizen sensing’ methods (Suman, 2021) where people source data about their local environment and use it to create public awareness, policy change or both. There is much room for expanding these methodologies and practices, as well as formalising and standardising them so that they can be a more accessible resource for policymakers (Suman, 2019). Another exception is the informal version of citizen sensing, sousveillance, which has a long history of disrupting the use of digital data for restricting public freedoms. Like citizen sensing, which tends to challenge the business and policy status quo, sousveillance practices are a dataﬁed tool for the marginalised or neglected to assert their rights and claim space in policy debates. Unlike established CSS analysis where people are addressed as passive research subjects generating data which can only meaningfully be analysed at scale, sousveillance analysis tends to be conducted on the micro-level, as, for example, in Akbari’s account of Iranian women tracking the moral police through Tehran in order to avoid their scrutiny (Akbari, 2019), van Doorn’s account of gig workers in Berlin collecting data to reverse-engineer a platform’s fee structures and challenge its labour practices (Doorn, 2020)or AlgorithmWatch’s construction of a crowdsourced credit check model in Germany (AlgorithmWatch, 2018). Although they also employ social science methods and can be rigorous and reliable, the entire point of these sousveillance methods is that they do not scale: they are local and speciﬁc, devised in response to particular challenges. They constitute participatory action research, a methodology where the research subject sets the agenda and where the aim is advancing social justice. Such methods constitute a claim to the right to participate, both in research and in society: they are an assertion of the presence and rights of the research subject. It is worth considering the numerous obstacles that this kind of research meets when it claims policy relevance: it has traditionally been rejected as unsystematic, not scalable, and unreliable because it reﬂects a local, rather than generalised, understanding (Chambers, 2007). These methods can be seen as the antithesis of current CSS in that they present a contradictory set of assumptions about what constitutes reliability, policy-relevance and participation. They also raise the question as to whether CSS in its current policy- and optimisation-oriented form can align with social justice concerns or whether data governance in this sphere should be aiming for legal compliance and harm reduction.

Chapter 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science David Leslie Abstract This chapter is concerned with setting up practical guardrails within the research activities and environments of Computational Social Science (CSS). It aims to provide CSS scholars, as well as policymakers and other stakeholders who apply CSS methods, with the critical and constructive means needed to ensure that their practices are ethical, trustworthy, and responsible. It begins by providing a taxonomy of the ethical challenges faced by researchers in the ﬁeld of CSS. These are challenges related to (1) the treatment of research subjects, (2) the impacts of CSS research on affected individuals and communities, (3) the quality of CSS research and to its epistemological status, (4) research integrity, and (5) research equity. Taking these challenges as motivation for cultural transformation, it then argues for the incorporation of end-to-end habits of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) into CSS practices, focusing on the role that contextual considerations, anticipatory reﬂection, impact assessment, public engagement, and justiﬁable and well-documented action should play across the research lifecycle. In proposing the inclusion of habits of RRI in CSS practices, the chapter lays out several practical steps needed for ethical, trustworthy, and responsible CSS research activities. These include stakeholder engagement processes, research impact assess- ments, data lifecycle documentation, bias self-assessments, and transparent research reporting protocols. 4.1 Introduction Since its inception, one of the great promises of Computational Social Science (CSS) has been the possibility of leveraging a variety of algorithmic techniques to gain insights and identify patterns in big social data that would have oth- erwise been unavailable to the researchers and policymakers who had to draw D.

By applying computational methods to the vast amounts of data generated from today’s complex, digitised, and dataﬁed society, CSS for policy is well placed to generate empirically grounded inferences, explanations, theories, and predictions about human behaviours, networks, and social systems, which not only effectively manage the volume and high dimensionality of big data but also, in fact, draw epistemic advantage from their unprecedented breadth, quantity, depth, and scale. This chapter is concerned with ﬂeshing out the myriad ethical challenges faced by this endeavour. It aims to provide CSS scholars, as well as policymakers and other stakeholders who apply CSS methods, with the critical and constructive means needed to ensure that their research is ethical, trustworthy, and responsi- ble. Though some signiﬁcant attempts to articulate the ethical stakes of CSS have been made by scholars and professional associations over the past two decades,1 the scarcity of ethics in the mainstream labours of CSS, and across its history,2 signals a general lack of awareness that is illustrative of several problematic dimensions of current CSS research practices that will motivate the arguments presented in this chapter. It is illustrative insofar as the absence of an active recognition of the ethical issues surrounding the social practice and wider human impacts of CSS may well shed light on a troublesome disconnection that persists between the self- understanding of CSS researchers who implicitly see themselves largely as neutral and disinterested scientists operating within the pure, self-contained conﬁnes of the laboratory or lecture hall, on the one hand, and the lived reality of their existence as contextually situated scholars whose framings, subject matters, categories, and methods have been forged in the crucible of history, society, and culture, on the other. 1 See, for instance, the series of Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) guidelines on internet research ethics published in 2002, 2012, and 2019 as well as the British Sociological Association (BSA) guidance. For scholarly interventions, see (Collmann & Matei, 2016;Dobrick etal., 2018; Ess & Jones, 2004; Eynon et al., 2017; Franzke et al., 2020; Giglietto et al., 2012; Hollingshead et al., 2021; Lomborg, 2013; Markham & Buchanan, 2012;Moreno et al., 2013; Salganik, 2019; Weinhardt, 2020). 2 For example, Across the four volumes of Nigel Gilbert’s magisterial Computational Social Science (2010), none of the 66 contributing chapters are dedicated to ethics. Likewise, no explicit mention or discussion of research ethics appears in Conte et al. (2012). There are only two passing mentions of ethics in the 10 chapters of Ciofﬁ-Revilla’s substantial Introduction to Computational Social Science (2014), and the word “ethics” also appears only twice (and only in the ﬁnal chapter) of Chen’s edited volume, Big Data for the Computational Social Sciences and Humanities (2018). 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 59 To be sure, when CSS researchers assume a scientistic “view from nowhere”3 and regard the objects of their study solely through quantitative and computational lenses, they run two signiﬁcant risks: First, they run the risk of assuming positivistic attitudes that frame the objects of their study through the quantifying and datafying lenses of models, formalisms, behaviours, networks, simulations, and systems thereby setting aside or trivialising ethical considerations in an effort to get to the real science without further ado. When the objects of the study of CSS are treated solely as elements of automated information analysis rather than as human subjects—each of whom possesses a unique dignity and is thus, ﬁrst and foremost, worthy of moral regard and interpretive care—scientistic subspecies of CSS are liable to run roughshod over fundamental rights and freedoms like privacy, autonomy, meaningful consent, and non-discrimination with a blindered view to furthering computational insight and data quantiﬁcation (Fuchs, 2018; Hollingshead et al., 2021). Second, they risk seeing themselves as operationally independent or even immune from the conditioning dynamics of the social environments they study and in which their own research activities are embedded (Feenberg, 1999, 2002). This can create conditions of deﬁcient reﬂexivity—i.e., defective self-awareness of the limitations of one’s own standpoint—and ethical precarity (Leslie et al., 2022a). As John Dewey long ago put it, “the notion of the complete separation of science from the social environment is a fallacy which encourages irresponsibility, on the part of scientists, regarding the social consequences of their work” (Dewey, 1938, p. 489). In the case of CSS for policy, the price of this misperceived independence of researchers from the formative dynamics of their sociohistorical environment has been extremely high. CSS practices have developed and matured in an age of unprecedented sociotechnical sea change—an age of unbounded digitisation, dataﬁcation, and mediatisation. The cascading societal effects of these revolutionary transformations have, in fact, directly shaped and implicated CSS in its research trajectories, motivations, objects, methods, and practices. The rise of the veritably limitless digitisation and dataﬁcation of social life has brought with it a correspond- ing impetus—among an expanding circle of digital platforms, private corporations, and governmental bodies—to engage in behavioural capture and manipulation at scale. In this wider societal context, the aggressive extraction and harvesting of data from the digital streams and traces generated by human activities, more often than not, occur without the meaningful consent or active awareness of the people whose 3 As Sorell (2013) has argued, scientism is typiﬁed by the privileging of natural or exact scientiﬁc language, knowledge, and methods over those of other branches of learning and culture, especially those of the “human sciences” like philosophy, ethics, history, anthropology, and sociology. Such a privileging of exact scientiﬁc “ideas, methods, practices, and attitudes” can be especially damaging where these are extended “to matters of human social and political concern” (Olson, 2008,p. 1)—matters that require an understanding of subtle historical, ethical, and sociocultural contexts, contending human values, norms, and purposes, and subjective meaning-complexes of action and interaction (Apel, 1984; Habermas, 1988;Taylor, 2021; von Wright, 2004; Weber, 1978; Wittgenstein, 2009). 60 D. Leslie digital and digitalised lives4 are the targets of increasing surveillance, consumer curation, computational herding, and behavioural steering. Such extractive and manipulative uses of computational technologies also often occur neither with adequate reﬂection on the potential transformative effects that they could have on the identity formation, agency, and autonomy of targeted data subjects nor with appropriate and community-involving assessment of the adverse impacts they could have on civic and social freedoms, human rights, the integrity of interpersonal relationships, and communal and biospheric well-being. The real threat here, for CSS, is that the prevailing “move fast and break things” attitude possessed by the drivers of the “big data revolution”, and by the beneﬁ- ciaries of its ﬁnancial and administrative windfalls, will simply be transposed into the key of the data-driven research practices they inﬂuence, making a “research fast and break things” posture a predominant disposition. This threat to the integrity of CSS research activity, in fact, derives from the potentially inappropriate dependency relationships which can emerge from power imbalances that exist between the CSS community of practice and those platforms, corporations, and public bodies who control access to the data resources, compute infrastructures, project funding opportunities, and career advancement prospects upon which CSS researchers rely for their professional viability and endurance. Here, the misperceived independence of researchers from their social environments can mask toxic and agenda-setting dependencies. Taken together, these downstream hazards signal potential deﬁcits in the social responsibility, trustworthiness, and ethical permissibility of its practices. To con- front such hazards, this chapter will ﬁrst provide a taxonomy of ethical challenges faced by CSS researchers. These are (1) challenges related to the treatment of research subjects, (2) challenges related to the impacts of CSS research on affected individuals and communities, (3) challenges related to the quality of CSS research and to its epistemological status, (4) challenges related to research integrity, and (5) challenges related to research equity. Taking these challenges as a motivation for cultural transformation, it will then argue for the incorporation into CSS practices of end-to-end habits of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), focusing, in particular, on the role that contextual considerations, anticipatory reﬂection, public engagement, and justiﬁable and well-documented action should play across the research lifecycle. The primary goal of this focus on RRI is to centre the understanding of CSS as “science with and for society” and to foster, in turn, critical self-reﬂection about the consequential role that human values, norms, and purposes play in its discovery and design processes and in considerations of the real-world effects of the insights and tools that these processes yield. In proposing the inclusion of habits of RRI in CSS practices, the chapter lays out several practical steps needed for ethical, trustworthy, and responsible CSS research activities. These include stakeholder engagement processes, research impact assessments, data lifecycle documentation, bias self-assessments, and transparent research reporting protocols. 4 The use of the terms ‘digital’ and ‘digitalised’ follows Lazer & Radford (2017). 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 61 4.2 Ethical Challenges Faced by CSS A preliminary step needed to motivate the centring of Responsible Research and Innovation practices in CSS is the identiﬁcation of the range of ethical challenges faced by its researchers. These challenges can be broken down into ﬁve categories: 1. Challenges related to the treatment of research subjects. These challenges have to do with the interrelated aspects of conﬁdentiality, data privacy and protection, anonymity, and informed consent. 2. Challenges related to the impacts of CSS research on affected individuals and communities. These challenges cover areas such as the potential adverse impacts of CSS research activities on the respect for human dignity and on other fundamental rights and freedoms. 3. Challenges related to the quality of CSS research and to its epistemological status. Challenges related to the quality of CSS research include erroneous data linkage, dubious “ideal user assumptions”, the infusion of algorithmic inﬂuence in observational datasets of digital traces, the “illusion of the veracity of volume”, and blind spots vis-à-vis non-human data generation that undermine data quality and integrity. Challenges related to the epistemological status of CSS include the inability of computation-driven techniques to fully capture non-random missingness in datasets and sociocultural conditions of data generation and hence a broader tendency to potentially misrepresent the real social world in the models, simulations, analyses, and predictions it generates. 4. Challenges related to research integrity. These challenges are rooted in the asymmetrical dynamics of resourcing and inﬂuence that can emerge from power imbalances between the CSS research community and the corporations and public agencies upon whom CSS scholars rely for access to the data resources, compute infrastructures, project funding opportunities, and career advancement prospects they need for their professional subsistence and advancement. 5. Challenges related to research equity. These challenges include the potential reinforcement of digital divides and data inequities through biased sampling techniques that render digitally marginalised groups invisible as well as potential aggregation biases in research results that mask meaningful differences between studied subgroups and therefore hide the existence of real-world inequities. Research equity challenges may also derive from long-standing dynamics of regional and global inequality that may undermine reciprocal sharing between research collaborators from more and less resourced geographical areas, univer- sities, or communities of practice. Let us expand on each of these challenges in turn. 62 D. Leslie 4.2.1 Challenges Related to the Treatment of Research Subjects When identifying and exploring challenges related to the treatment of research subjects in CSS, it is helpful to make a distinction between participation-based and observation-based research, namely, between CSS research that is gathering data directly from research subjects through their deliberate involvement in digital media (e.g., research that uses online methods to gather data by way of human involvement in surveys, experiments, or participatory activities) and CSS research that is investigating human action and social interaction in observed digital environments, like social media or search platforms, through the recording, measurement, and analysis of digital life, digital traces, and digitalised life (Eynon et al., 2017). Though participation-based and observation-based research raise some overlapping issues related to privacy and data protection, there are notable differences that yield unique challenges. Several general concerns about privacy preservation, data protection, and the responsible handling and storage of data are common to participation-based and observation-based CSS research. This is because empirical CSS research often explores topics that require the collection, analysis, and management of personal data, i.e., data that can uniquely identify individual human beings. Although CSS research frequently spans different jurisdictions, which may have diverging privacy and data protection laws, responsible research practices that aim to optimally protect the rights and interests of research subjects in light of risks posed to conﬁdentiality, privacy, and anonymity should recur to the highest standards of privacy preservation, data protection, and the responsible handling and storage of data. They should also establish and institute proportionate protocols for attaining informed and meaningful consent that are appropriate to the speciﬁc contexts of the data extraction and use and that cohere with the reasonable expectations of the targeted research subjects. Notwithstanding this common footing for ethics considerations related to data protection and the privacy of research subjects, participation-based and observation- based approaches to CSS research each raise distinctive issues. For researchers who focus on online observation or who use data captured from digital traces or data extracted from connected mobile devices, the Internet of Things, public sensors and recording devices, or networked cyber-physical systems, coming to an appropriate understanding of the reasonable expectations of research subjects regarding their privacy and anonymity is a central challenge. When observed research subjects move through their synchronous digital and connected envi- ronments striving to maintain communication ﬂows and coherent social inter- actions, they must navigate moment-to-moment choices about the disclosure of personal information (Joinson et al., 2007). In physical public spaces and in online settings, the perception of anonymity (i.e., of the ability to speak and act freely without feeling like one is continuously being identiﬁed or under constant watch) is an important precondition of frictionless information exchange and, 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 63 correspondingly, of the exercise of freedoms of movement, expression, speech, assembly, and association (Jiang, 2013; Paganoni, 2019; Selinger & Hartzog, 2020). On the internet, moreover, an increased sense of anonymity may lead data subjects to more freely disclose personal information, opinions, and beliefs that they may not have shared in ofﬂine milieus (Meho, 2006). In all these instances of perceived anonymity, research subjects may act under reasonable expectations of gainful obscurity and “privacy in public” (Nissenbaum, 1998; Reidenberg, 2014). These expectations are responsive to and bounded by the changing contexts of communication, namely, by contextual factors like who one is interacting with, how one is exchanging information, what type of information is being exchanged, how sensitive it is perceived to be, and where and when such exchanges are occurring (Quan-Haase & Ho, 2020). This means, not only, that the protection of privacy must, ﬁrst and foremost, consider contextual determinants (Collmann & Matei, 2016; Nissenbaum, 2011; Steinmann et al., 2015). It also implies that privacy protection considerations must acknowledge that the privacy preferences of research subjects can change from circumstance to circumstance and are therefore not one-off or one-dimensional decisions that can be made at the entry point to the usage of digital or social media applications through Terms of Service or end-user license agreements—which often go unread—or the initial determination of privacy settings (Henderson et al., 2013). For this reason, the conduct of observation-based research in CSS that pertains to digital and digitalised life should be informed by contextual considerations about the populations and social groups from whom the data are drawn, the character and potential sensitivities of their data, the nature of the research question (as it may be perceived by observed research subjects), research subjects’ reasonable expectations of privacy in public, and the data collection practices and protocols of the organisation or company which has extracted the data (Hollingshead et al., 2021). Notably, thorough assessment of these issues by members of a research team may far exceed formal institutional processes for gaining ethics approval, and it is the responsibility of CSS researchers to evaluate the appropriate scale and depth of privacy considerations regardless of minimal legal and institutional requirements (Eynon et al., 2017; Henderson et al., 2013). Apart from these contextual considerations, the protection of the privacy and anonymity of CSS research subjects also requires that risks of re-identiﬁcation through triangulation and data linkage are anticipated and addressed. While pro- cesses of anonymisation and removal of personally identiﬁable information from datasets scraped or extracted from digital platforms and digitalised behaviour may seem straightforward when those data are treated in isolation, multiple sources of linkable data points and multiple sites of downstream data collection pose tangible risks of re-identiﬁcation via the combination and linkage of datasets (de Montjoye et al., 2015; Eynon et al., 2017; Obole & Welsh, 2012). As Narayanan & Shmatikov (2009) and de Montjoye et al. (2015) both demonstrate, the inferential triangulation of social data collected from just a few sources can lead to re-identiﬁcation even under conditions where datasets have been 64 D. Leslie anonymised in the conventional, single dataset sense. Moreover, when risks of triangulation and re-identiﬁcation are considered longitudinally, downstream risks of de-anonymisation also arise. In this case, the endurance of the public accessibility of social data on the internet over time means that information that could lead to re-identiﬁcation is ready-to-hand indeﬁnitely. By the same token, the production and extraction of new data that post-dates the creation and use of anonymised datasets also present downstream opportunities for data linkage and inference creep that can lead to re-identiﬁcation through unanticipated triangulation (Weinhardt, 2020). Although many of these privacy and data protection risks also affect participation-based research (especially in cases where observational research is combined or integrated with it), experimental and human-involving CSS projects face additional challenges. Signally, participation-based CSS research must confront several issues surrounding the ascertainment of informed and meaningful consent. The importance of consent has been a familiar part of the “human subjects” paradigm of research ethics from its earliest expressions in the World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki5 and the Belmont Report.6 However, the exponentially greater scale and societal penetration of CSS in comparison to more conventional forms of face-to-face, survey-driven, or laboratory-based social scientiﬁc research present a new order of hazards and difﬁculties. First, since CSS researchers, or their collaborators, often control essential digital infrastructure like social media platforms, they have the capability to efﬁciently target and experiment on previously unimaginable numbers of human subjects, with potential N’s approaching magnitudes of hundreds of thousands or even millions of people. Moreover, in the mould of such platforms, these researchers have an unprecedented capacity to manipulate or surreptitiously intervene in the unsuspecting activities and behaviours of such large, targeted groups. The controversy around the 2014 Facebook emotional contagion experiment demonstrates some of the potential risks generated by this new scale of research capacity (Grimmelmann, 2015; Lorenz, 2014; Puschmann & Bozdag, 2014). In the study, researchers from Facebook, Cornell, and the University of California involved almost 700,000 unknowing Facebook users in what has since been called a “secret mood manipulation experiment” (Meyer, 2014). Users were split into two experimental groups and exposed to negative or positive emotional content to test whether News Feed posts could spread the relevant positive or negative emotion. Critics of the approach soon protested that the failure to obtain consent—or even to inform research subjects about the experiment—violated basic research ethics. Some also highlighted the dehumanising valence of these research tactics: “To Face- book, we are all lab rats”, wrote Vindu Goel in the New York Times (Goel, 2014). Hyperbole aside, this latter comment makes explicit the internal logic of many of 5 https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for- medical-research-involving-human-subjects/ 6 https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 65 the moral objections to the experiment that were voiced at the time. The Facebook researchers had blurred the relationship between the laboratory and the lifeworld. They had, in effect, unilaterally converted the social world of people connecting and interacting online into a world of experimental objects that subsisted merely as standing reserve for computational intervention and study—a transformation of the interpersonally animated life of the community into the ethically impoverished terrain of an “information laboratory” (Cohen, 2019a). Behind such a degrading conversion was the assertion of the primacy of objectifying and scientistic attitudes over considerations of the equal moral status and due ethical regard of research subjects. The experiment had, on the critical view, reduced Facebook users to the non-human standing of laboratory rodents, thereby disregarding their dignity and autonomy and consequently failing to properly consult them so to attain their informed consent to participate. Even when the consent of research participants is sought by CSS researchers, a few challenges remain. These revolve around the question of how to ensure that participants are fully informed so that they can freely, meaningfully, and knowledgeably consent to their involvement in the research (Franzke et al., 2020). Though diligent documentation protocols for gaining consent are an essential ele- ment of ascertaining informed and meaningful consent in any research environment, in the digital or online milieus of CSS, the provision of this kind of text-based information is often inadequate. When consent documentation is provided in online environments through one-way or vertical information ﬂows that do not involve real, horizontal dialogue between researchers and potential research subjects, oppor- tunities to clarify possible misunderstandings of the terms of consent can be lost (Varnhagen et al., 2005). What is more, it becomes difﬁcult under these conditions of incomplete or impeded communication to conﬁrm that research subject actually comprehend what they are agreeing to do as research participants (Eynon et al., 2017). Relatedly, barriers to information exchange in the online environment can prevent researchers from being able to verify the capacity of research subjects to consent freely and knowledgeably (Eynon et al., 2017; Kraut et al., 2004). That is, it is more difﬁcult to detect potential limitations of or impairments in the competence of participants (e.g., from potentially vulnerable subgroups) in giving consent where researchers are at a signiﬁcant digital remove from research subjects. In all these instances, various non-dialogical techniques for conﬁrming informed consent are available—such as comprehension tests, smart forms that employ branching logic to ensure essential text is completely read, identity veriﬁcation, etc. Such techniques, however, present varying degrees of uncertainty and drop-out risk (Kraut et al., 2004; Varnhagen et al., 2005), and they do not adequately substitute for interactive mechanisms that could connect researchers directly with participants and their potential questions and concerns. 66 D. Leslie 4.2.2 Challenges Related to the Impacts of CSS Research on Affected Individuals and Communities While drawing on the formal techniques and methods of mathematics, statistics, and the exact sciences, CSS is a research practice that is policy-oriented, problem- driven, and societally consequential. As an applied science that directly engages with issues of immense social concern like socioeconomic inequality, the spread of infectious disease, and the growth of disinformation and online harm, it impacts individuals and communities with the results, capabilities, and tools it generates. Moreover, CSS is an “instrument-enabled science” (Ciofﬁ-Revilla, 2014,p. 4) that employs computational techniques, which can be applied to large-scale datasets excavated from veritably all societal sectors and spheres of human activity and expe- rience. This makes its researchers the engineers and custodians of a general purpose research technology whose potential scope in addressing societal challenges is seemingly unbounded. With this in view, Lazer et al. (2020) call for the commitment of “resources, from public and private sources, that are extraordinary by current standards of social science funding” to underwrite the rapid expansion of CSS research infrastructure, so that its proponents can enlarge their quest to “solve real- world problems” (p. 1062). Beyond the dedication of substantial resources, such an expansion, Lazer et al. (2020) argue, also requires the formulation of “policies that would encourage or mandate the ethical use of private data that preserves public values like privacy, autonomy, security, human dignity, justice, and balance of power to achieve important public goals—whether to predict the spread of disease, shine a light on societal issues of equity and access, or the collapse of the economy” (p. 1061). CSS, along these lines, is not simply an applied social science, a science for policy. It is a social impact science par excellence. The mission-driven and impact-oriented perspective conveyed here is, however, a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the drive to improve the human lot and to solve societal problems through the fruits of scientiﬁc discovery has constructively guided the impetus of modern scientiﬁc research and innovation at least since the seventeenth-century dawning of the Baconian and Newtonian revolutions. In this sense, the practical and problem-solving aspirations for CSS expressed by Lazer et al. (2020) are continuous with a deeper tradition of societally oriented science. On the other hand, the view that CSS is a mission-driven and impact-oriented science raises a couple of thorny ethical issues that are not necessarily solvable by the application of its own methodological and epistemic resources. First, the assumption of a mission-driven starting point surfaces a difﬁcult set of questions about the relationship of CSS research to the values, interests, and power dynamics that inﬂuence the trajectories of its practice: Whose missions are driving CSS and whose values and interests are informing the policies that are guiding these missions? To what extent are these values and interests shared by those who are likely to be impacted by the research? To what extent do these values and interests, and the policies they shape, sufﬁciently reﬂect the plurality of values and interests that are possessed by members of communities who will potentially be affected by 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 67 the research (especially those from historically marginalised, discriminated-against, and vulnerable social groups)? Are these missions determined through democratic and community-involving processes or do other parties (e.g., funders, research collaborators, resource providers, principal investigators, etc.) wield asymmetrical agenda-setting power in setting the direction of travel for the research and its outputs? Who are the beneﬁciaries of these mission-driven research projects and who are at risk of any adverse impacts that they could have? Are these potential risks and beneﬁts equitably distributed or are some stakeholders disparately exposed to harm while others in positions of disproportionate advantage? Taken together, these questions about the role that values, interests, and power dynamics play in shaping mission-driven research and its potential impacts evoke critical, though often concealed, interdependencies that exist between the CSS community of practice and the social environments in which its research activities, subject matters, and outputs are embedded. They likewise evoke the inadequacy of evasive scientistic tendencies to appeal to neutral or value-free stances when faced with queries about how values, interests, and power dynamics motivate and inﬂuence the aims, purposes, and areas of concern that steer vectors of CSS research. Responding appropriately to such questions surrounding the social determinants of research paths and potential impacts demands an inclusive broadening of the conversations that shape, articulate, and determine the missions to be pursued, the problems to be addressed, and the assessment of potential harms and beneﬁts—a broadening both in terms of the types of knowledge and expertise that are integrated into such deliberative processes and in terms of the range of stakeholder groups that should be involved. Second, the recognition of a mission-driven and impact-oriented starting point elevates the importance of identifying the potential adverse effects of CSS research so that these can, as far as possible, be pinpointed at the outset of research projects and averted. Such practices of anticipatory reﬂection are necessary because the intended and unintended consequences of the societally impactful insights, tools, and capabilities CSS research produces could be negative and injurious rather than positive and mission-supporting. As the short history of the “big data revolution” demonstrates, the rapid and widespread proliferation of algorithmic systems, data- driven technologies, and computation-led analytics has already had numerous deleterious effects on human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic values, and biospheric sustainability. Such harmful effects have penetrated society at multiple levels including on the planes of individual agency, social interaction, and biospheric integrity. Let us brieﬂy consider these levels in turn. 4.2.2.1 Adverse Impacts at the Individual Level At the agent level, the predominance “radical behaviourist” attitudes among the academic, industrial, and governmental drivers of data innovation ecosystems have led to the pervasive mobilisation of individual-targeting predictive analytics which have had damaging impacts across a range of human activities (Cardon, 2016; 68 D. Leslie Cohen, 2019b; Zuboff, 2019). For instance, in the domain of e-commerce and ad-tech, strengthening regimes of consumer surveillance have fuelled the use of “large-scale behavioural technologies” (Ball, 2019) that have enabled incessant practices of hyper-personalised psychographic proﬁling, consumer curation, and behavioural nudging. As critics have observed, such technologies have tended to exploit the emotive vulnerabilities and psychological weaknesses of targeted people (Helbing et al., 2019), instrumentalising them as monetisable sites of “behavioural surplus” (Zuboff, 2019) and treating them as manipulable objects of prediction and “behavioural certainty” rather than as reﬂective subjects worthy of decision-making autonomy and moral regard (Ball, 2019; Yeung, 2017). Analogous behaviourist postures have spurred state actors and other public bodies to subject their increas- ingly dataﬁed citizenries to algorithmic nudging techniques that aim to obtain aggregated patterns of desired behaviour which accord with government generated models and predictions (Fourcade & Gordon, 2020;Hern, 2021). Some scholars have characterised such an administrative ambit as promoting the paternalistic displacement of individual agency and the degradation of the conditions needed for the successful exercise of human judgment, moral reasoning, and practical rationality (Fourcade & Gordon, 2020; Spaulding, 2020). In like manner, the nearly ubiquitous scramble to capture behavioural shares of user engagement across online search, entertainment, and social media platforms has led to parallel feedback loops of digital surveillance, algorithmic manipula- tion, and behavioural engineering (Van Otterlo, 2014). The proliferation of the so-called “attention market” business model (Wu, 2019) has prompted digital platforms to measure commercial success in terms of the non-consensual seizure and monopolisation of focused mental activity. This has fostered the deleterious attachment of targeted consumer populations to a growing ecosystem of “distraction technologies” (Syvertsen, 2020; Syvertsen & Enli, 2020) and compulsion-forming social networking sites and reputational platforms, consequently engendering, on some accounts, widespread forms of surveillant anxiety (Crawford, 2014), cognitive impairment (Wu, 2019), mental health issues (Banjanin et al., 2015; Barry et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2016; Méndez-Diaz et al., 2022; Peterka-Bonetta et al., 2019), and diminished adolescent self-esteem and quality of life (Scott & Woods, 2018;Viner et al., 2019; Woods & Scott, 2016). 4.2.2.2 Adverse Impacts at the Social Level Setting aside the threats to basic individual dignity and human autonomy that these patterns of instrumentalisation, disempowerment, and exploitation present (Aizenberg & van den Hoven, 2020; Halbertal, 2015), the proliferation of data- driven behavioural steering at the collective level has also generated risks to the integrity of social interaction, interpersonal solidarity, and democratic ways of life. In current digital information and communication environments, for example, the predominant steering force of social media and search engine platforms has mobilised opaque computational methods of relevance ranking, popularity sorting, 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 69 and trend predicting to produce calculated digital publics devoid of any sort of active participatory social or political choice (Beer, 2017; Bogost, 2015; Cardon, 2016; Gillespie, 2014; O’Neil, 2016; Striphas, 2015; Ziewitz, 2016). Rather than being guided by the deliberatively achieved political will of interacting citizens, this vast meshwork of connected digital services shapes these computationally fashioned publics in accordance with the drive to commodify monitored behaviour and to target and capture user attention (Carpentier, 2011; De Cleen & Carpentier, 2008; Dean, 2010; Fuchs, 2021; John, 2013;Zuckerman, 2020). And, as this manufac- turing of digital publics is ever more pressed into the service of proﬁt seeking by downstream algorithmic mechanisms of hyper-personalised proﬁling, engagement- driven ﬁltering, and covert behavioural manipulation, democratic agency and participation-centred social cohesion will be increasingly supplanted by insidious forms of social sorting and digital atomisation (Vaidhyanathan, 2018; van Dijck, 2013; van Dijck et al., 2018). Combined with complimentary dynamics of wealth polarisation and rising inequality (Wright et al., 2021), such an attenuation of social capital, discursive interaction, and interpersonal solidarity is already underwriting the crisis of social and political polarisation, the widespread kindling of societal distrust, and the animus towards rational debate and consensus-based science that have come to typify contemporary post-truth contexts (Cosentino, 2020; D’Ancona, 2017;Harsin, 2018; McIntyre, 2018). Indeed, as these and similar kinds of computation-based social sorting and management infrastructures continue to multiply, they promise to jeopardise more and more of the formative modes of open interpersonal communication that have enabled the development of crucial relations of mutual trust and responsibility among interacting individuals in modern democratic societies. This is beginning to manifest in the widespread deployment of algorithmic labour and productivity management technologies, where manager-worker and worker-worker relations of reciprocal accountability and interpersonal recognition are being displaced by depersonalising mechanisms of automated assessment, continuous digital surveil- lance and computation-based behavioural incentivisation, discipline, and control (Ajunwa et al., 2017; Akhtar & Moore, 2016; Kellogg et al., 2020; Moore, 2019). The convergence of the unremitting sensor-based tracking and monitoring of workers’ movements, affects, word choices, facial expressions, and other biometric cues, with algorithmic models that purport to detect and correct defective moods, emotions, and levels of psychological engagement and well-being, may not simply violate a worker’s sense of bodily, emotional, and mental integrity by rendering their inner life legible and available for managerial intervention as well as productivity optimisation (Ball, 2009). These forms of ubiquitous personnel tracking and labour management can also have so-called panoptic effects (Botan, 1996;Botan & McCreadie, 1990), causing people to alter their behaviour on suspicion it is being constantly observed or analysed and deterring the sorts of open worker-to- worker interactions that enable the development of reciprocal trust, social solidarity, and interpersonal connection. This labour management example merely signals a broader constellation of ethical hazards that are raised by the parallel use of sensor- and location-based surveillance, psychometric and physiognomic proﬁling (Agüera 70 D. Leslie y Arcas et al., 2017; Barrett et al., 2019; Chen & Whitney, 2019; Gifford, 2020; Hoegen et al., 2019; Stark & Hutson, 2021), and computation-driven technologies of behavioural governance in areas like education (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020; Pasquale, 2020), job recruitment (Sánchez-Monedero et al., 2020; Sloane et al., 2022), criminal justice (Brayne, 2020; Pasquale & Cashwell, 2018), and border control (Amoore, 2021; Muller, 2019). The heedless deployment of these kinds of algorithmic systems could have transformative effects on democratic agency, social cohesion, and interpersonal intimacy, preventing people from exercising their freedoms of expression, assembly, and association and violating their right to participate fully and openly in the moral, cultural, and political life of the community. 4.2.2.3 Adverse Impacts at the Biospheric Level Lastly, at the level of biospheric integrity and sustainability, the exploding comput- ing power—which has played a major part in ushering in the “big data revolution” and the rise of CSS—has also had signiﬁcant environmental costs that deserve ethical consideration. As Lannelongue et al. (2021) point out, “the contribution of data centers and high-performance computing facilities to climate change is substantial ... with 100 megatonnes of CO2 emissions per year, similar to American commercial aviation”. At bottom, this increased energy consumption has hinged on the development of large, computationally intensive algorithmic models that ingest abundant amounts of data in their training and tuning, that undergo iterative model selection and hyperparameter experiments, and that require exponential augmentations in model size and complexity to achieve relatively modest gains in accuracy (Schwartz et al., 2020; Strubell et al., 2019). In real terms, this has meant that the amount of compute needed to train complex, deep learning models increased by 300,000 times in 6 years (from 2013 to 2019) with training expenditures of energy doubling every 6 months (Amodei & Hernandez, 2018;Schwartz et al., 2020). Strubell et al. (2019) observe, along these lines, that training Google’s large language model, BERT, on GPU, produces substantial carbon emissions “roughly equivalent to a trans-American ﬂight”. Though recent improvements in algorithmic techniques, software, and hardware have meant some efﬁciency gains in the operational energy consumption of computationally hungry, state-of-the-art models, some have stressed that such training costs are increasingly compounded by the carbon emissions generated by hardware manufacturing and infrastructure (e.g., designing and fabricating integrated circuits) (Gupta et al., 2020). Regardless of the sources of emissions, important ethical issues emerge both from the overall contribution of data research and innovation practices to climate change and to the degradation of planetary health and from the differential distribution of the beneﬁts and risks that derive from the design and use of computationally intensive models. As Bender et al. (2021) have emphasised, such allocations of beneﬁts and risks have closely tracked the historical patterns of environmental racism, coloniality, and “slow violence” (Nixon, 2011) that have typiﬁed the disproportionate exposure of 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 71 marginalised communities (especially those who inhabit what has conventionally been referred to as “the Global South”) to the pollution and destruction of local ecosystems and to involuntary displacement. As a whole, these cautionary illustrations of the hazards posed at individual, societal, and environmental levels by ever more ubiquitous computational interven- tions in the social world should impel CSS researchers to adopt an ethically sober and pre-emptive posture when reﬂecting on the potential impacts of their projects. The reason for this is not just that many of the methods, tools, capabilities, and epistemic frameworks that they utilise have already operated, in the commercial and political contexts of dataﬁcation, as accessories to adverse societal impacts. It is, perhaps more consequentially, that, as Wagner et al. (2021) point out, CSS practices of measurement and corollary theory construction in “algorithmically infused societies ... indirectly alter behaviours by informing the development of social theories and subsequently inﬂuence the algorithms and technologies that draw on those theories” (p. 197). This dimension of the “performativity” of CSS research—i.e., the way that the activities and theories of CSS researchers can function to reformat, reorganise, and shape the phenomena that they purport only to measure and analyse—is crucial (Healy, 2015; Wagner et al., 2021). It enjoins, for instance, an anticipatory awareness that the methodological predominance of measurement-centred and prediction-driven perspectives in CSS can support the noxious proliferation of the scaled computational manipulation and instrumentali- sation of large populations of affected people (Eynon et al., 2017; Schroeder, 2014). It also implores cognizance that an unreﬂective embrace of unbounded sociometrics and the pervasive sensor-based observation and monitoring of research subjects may support wider societal patterns of “surveillance creep” (Lyon, 2003;Marx, 1988) and ultimately have chilling effects on the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms. The intractable endurance of these kinds of risks of adverse effects and the possibilities for unintended harmful consequences recommends vigilance both in the assessment of the potential impacts of CSS research on affected individuals and communities and in the dynamic monitoring of the effects of the research outputs, and the affordances they create, once these are released into the social world. 4.2.3 Challenges Related to the Quality of CSS Research and to Its Epistemological Status CSS research that is of dubious quality or that misrepresents the world can produce societal harms by misleading people, misdirecting policies, and misguiding further academic research. Many of the pitfalls that can undermine CSS research quality are precipitated by deﬁciencies in the accuracy and the integrity of the datasets on which it draws. First off, erroneous data linkage can lead to false theories and conclusions. Researchers face ongoing challenges when they endeavour to connect the data generated by identiﬁed research subjects to other datasets that are believed to include 72 D. Leslie additional information about those individuals (Weinhardt, 2020). Mismatches can poison downstream inferences in undetectable ways and lead to model brittleness, hampered explanatory power, and distorted world pictures. The poisoning of inferences by corrupted, inaccurate, invalid, or unreliable datasets can occur in a few other ways. Where CSS researchers are not sufﬁciently critical of the “ideal user assumption” (Lazer & Radford, 2017), they can overlook instances in which data subjects intentionally mispresent themselves, subsequently perverting the datasets in which they are included. For example, online actors can multiply their identities as “sock puppets” by creating fake accounts that serve different purposes; they can also engage in “gaslighting” or “catﬁshing” where intentional methods of deception about personal characteristics and misrepresen- tation of identities are used to fool other users or to game the system; they can additionally impersonate real internet users to purposefully mislead or exploit others (Bu et al., 2013; Ferrara, 2015; Lazer & Radford, 2017;Wang et al., 2006; Woolley, 2016; Woolley & Howard, 2018; Zheng et al., 2006). Such techniques of deception can be automated or deployed using various kinds of robots (e.g., chat bots, social media bots, robocalls, spam bots, etc.) (Ferrara et al., 2016; Gupta et al., 2015; Lazer & Radford, 2017; Ott et al., 2011). If researchers are not appropriately attentive to the distortions that may arise in datasets as a result of such non-human sources of misleading data, they can end up unintentionally baking the corresponding corruptions of the underlying distribution that are present in the sample into their models and theories, thereby misrepresenting or painting a false picture of the social world (Ruths & Pfeffer, 2014;Shah et al., 2015). Similar blind spots in detecting dataset corruption can arise when sparse attention is paid to how the algorithms, which pervade the curation and delivery of information on online platforms, affect and shape the data that is generated by the users that they inﬂuence and steer (Wagner et al., 2021). Attentiveness to such data quality and integrity issues can be hindered by the illusion of the veracity of volume or, what has been termed, “big data hubris” (Hollingshead et al., 2021; Kitchin, 2014; Lazer et al., 2014; Mahmoodi et al., 2017). This is the misconception that, in virtue of their sheer volume, big data can “solve all problems”, including potential deﬁciencies in data quality, sampling, and research design (Hollingshead et al., 2021; Meng, 2018). When it is believed that “data quantity is a substitute for knowledge-driven methodologies and theories” (Mahmoodi et al., 2017, p. 57), the rigorous and epistemically vetted approaches to social measurement, theory construction, explanation, and understanding that have evolved over decades in the social sciences and statistics can be perilously neglected or even dismissed. Such a potential impoverishment of epistemic vigour can also result when CSS researchers fall prey to the enticements of the ﬂip side of big data hubris, namely, computational solutionism. Predispositions to computational solutionism have emerged as a result of the coalescence of the rapid growth of computing power and the accelerating development of complex algorithmic modelling techniques that have together complemented the explosion of voluminous data and the big data revolution. This new access to the computational tools availed by potent compute 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 73 and high-dimensional algorithmic machinery have led to the misconception in some corners of CSS that tools themselves can, by and large, “solve all problems”. Rather than confronting the contextual complexities that lie behind the social processes and historical conditions that generate observational data (Shaw, 2015; Törnberg & Uitermark, 2021), and that concomitantly create manifold possibilities for non- random missingness and meaningful noise, the computational solutionist reverts to a toolbox of heuristic algorithms and technical tricks to “clean up” the data, so that computational analysis can forge ahead frictionlessly (Agniel et al., 2018; Leonelli, 2021). At heart, this contextual sightlessness among some CSS researchers originates in scientistic attitudes that tend to naturalise and reify digital trace data (Törnberg & Uitermark, 2021), treating them as primitive and organically given units of measurement that facilitate the analytical capture of “social physics” (Pentland, 2015), “the ‘physics of culture’” (Manovich, 2011), or the “physics of society” (Caldarelli et al., 2018). The scientistic aspiration to discover invariant “laws of society” rests on this erroneous naturalisation of social data. Were the conﬁdence of CSS research in such a naturalist purity of data to be breeched and their contextual and sociohistorical origins appropriately acknowledged, then the scientistic metanarratives that underwrite beliefs in “social physics”, and in its nomological character, would consequently be subverted. Computational solution- ism provides an epistemic strategy for the wholesale avoidance of this problem: it directs researchers to rely solely on the virtuosity of algorithmic tooling and the computational engineering of observational data to address congenital problems of noise, confounders, and non-random missingness rather than employing a genuine methodological pluralism that takes heed of the critical importance of context and of the complicated social and historical conditions surrounding the generation and construction of data. Such a solutionist tack, however, comes at the cost of potentially misapprehending the circumstantial intricacies and the historically contingent evolution of agential entanglements, social structures, and interpersonal relations and of thereby “misrepresenting the real world” in turn (Ruths & Pfeffer, 2014, p. 1063). In addition to these risks posed to the epistemic integrity of CSS by big data hubris and computational solutionism, CSS researchers face another challenge related to the epistemological status of the claims and conclusion they hold forth. This has to do with the problem of interpretability. As the mathematical models employed in CSS research have come to possess ever greater access both to big data and to increasing computing power, their designers have correspondingly been able to enlarge the feature spaces of these computational systems and to turn to gradually more complex mapping functions in order either to forecast future observations or to explain underlying causal structures or effects. In many cases, this has meant vast improvements in the performance of models that have become more accurate and expressive, but this has also meant the growing prevalence of non- linearity, non-monotonicity, and high-dimensional complexity in an expanding array of so-called “black box” models (Leslie, 2019). Once high-dimensional feature spaces and complex functions are introduced into algorithmic models, the effects of changes in any given input can become so entangled with the values and 74 D. Leslie interactions of other inputs that understanding the rationale behind how individual components are transformed into outputs becomes extremely difﬁcult. The complex and unintuitive curves of many of these models’ decision functions preclude linear and monotonic relations between their inputs and outputs. Likewise, the high- dimensionality of their architectures—frequently involving millions of parameters and complex correlations—presents a sweep of compounding statistical associations that range well beyond the limits of human-scale cognition and understanding. Such increasing complexity in input-output mappings creates model opacity and barriers to interpretability. The epistemological problem, here, is that, as a science that seeks to explain, clarify, and facilitate a better understanding of the human phenomena it investigates, CSS would seemingly have to avoid or renounce incomprehensible models that obstruct the demonstration of sound scientiﬁc reasoning in the conclu- sions and results attained. A few epistemic strategies have emerged over the past decade or so to deal with the challenge posed by the problem of interpretability in CSS. First, building on a longstanding distinction originally made by statisticians between the predictive and explanatory functions of computational modelling (Breiman, 2001; Mahmoodi et al., 2017; Shmueli, 2010), some CSS scholars have focused on the importance of predictive accuracy, de-prioritising the goals of discovering and explaining the causal mechanisms and reasons that lie behind the dynamics of human behaviour and social systems (Anderson, 2008; Hindman, 2015;Lin, 2015; Yarkoni & Westfall, 2017). Lin (2015), for instance, makes a distinction between the goal of “better science”, i.e., “to reveal insights about the human condition”, what Herbert Simon called the “basic science” of explaining phenomena (2002), and the goal of “better engineering”, i.e., “to produce computational artifacts that are more effective according to well-deﬁned metrics” (p. 35)—what Simon called the “applied science” of inferring or predicting from known variables to unknown variables (Shmueli, 2010; Simon, 2002). For Lin, if the purpose of CSS, as an applied science, is “better engineering”, then “whatever improves those [predictive] metrics should be exploited without prejudice. Sound scientiﬁc reasoning, while helpful, is not necessary to improve engineering”. Such a positivistic view would, of course, tamp down or even cast aside the desideratum of interpretability. However, even for scholars that aspire to retain both the explanatory and predictive dimensions of CSS, the necessity of using interpretable models is far from universally embraced. Illustratively, Hofman et al. (2021) argue for “integrating explanation and prediction in CSS” by treating these approaches as complementary (cf. Engel, 2021; James et al., 2013; Mahmoodi et al., 2017). Still, these authors simultaneously claim that explanatory modelling is about “the estimation of causal effects, regardless of whether those effects are explicitly tied to theoretically motivated mechanisms that are interpretable as ‘the cogs and wheels of the causal process’” (Hofman et al., 2021, p. 186). To be sure, they maintain that: interpretability is logically independent of both the causal and predictive properties of a model. That is, in principle a model can accurately predict outcomes under interventions or previously unseen circumstances (out of distribution), thereby demonstrating that it captures the relevant causal relationships, and still be resistant to human intuition (for example, 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 75 quantum mechanics in the 1920s). Conversely, a theory can create the subjective experience of having made sense of many diverse phenomena without being either predictively accurate or demonstrably causal (for example, conspiracy theories). (pp. 186–187) These justiﬁcations for treating the goal of interpretability as independent from the causal and predictive characteristics of a model raise some concerns. At an epistemic level, the extreme claim that “interpretability is logically independent of both the causal and predictive properties of a model” is unsupported by the observation that people can be deluded into believing false states of affairs. The attempt to cast aside the principal need for the rational acceptability and justiﬁcation of the assertoric validity claims that explain a model’s causal and predictive properties, because it is possible to be misled by “subjective experience”, smacks of a curious epistemological relativism which is inconsistent with the basic requisites of scientiﬁc reasoning and deliberation. It offends the “no magic doctrine” (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998) of interpretable modelling, namely, that “it needs to be clear how (good) model performance comes about, that the components of the model are understandable and linked to known processes” (Schultheis, 2021). To level off all adjudications of explanatory claims (strong or weak) about a model because humans can be duped by misled feelings of subjective experience amounts to an absurdity: People can be convinced of bad explanations that are not predictively or causally efﬁcacious (look at all those sorry souls who have fallen prey to conspiracy theories), so all explanations of complex models are logically independent of their actual causal and predictive properties. This line of thinking ends up in a ditch of epistemic whataboutism. Moreover, at an ethical level, the analogy offered by Hofman et al. between the opaqueness of quantum physics and the opaqueness of “black box” predictive mod- els about human behaviours and social dynamics is misguided and unsupportable. Such an erroneous parallelism is based on a scientistic confusion of the properties of natural scientiﬁc variables (like the wavelike mechanics of electrons) that function as heuristics for theory generation, testing, and conﬁrmation in the exact physical sciences and the properties of the social variables of CSS whose generation, construction, and correlation are the result of human choices, evolving cultural patterns, and path dependencies created by sociohistorical structures. Unlike the physics data generated, for instance, by ﬁring a spectroscopic light through a perforated cathode and measuring the splitting of the Balmer lines of a radiated hydrogen spectrum, the all-too-human genealogy of social data means that they can harbour discriminatory biases and patterns of sociohistorical inequity and injustice that become buried within the architectures of complex computational models. In this respect, the “relevant causal relationships” that are inaccessible in opaque models might be fraught with objectionable sociohistorical patterns of inequity, prejudice, coloniality, and structural racism, sexism, ablism, etc. (Leslie et al., 2022a). Because “human data encodes human biases by default” (Packer et al., 2018), complex algorithmic models can house and conceal a troubling range of unfair biases and discriminatory associations—from social biases against gender (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Lucy & Bamman, 2021; Nozza et al., 2021; Sweeney & 76 D. Leslie Najaﬁan, 2019;Zhao et al., 2017), race (Benjamin, 2019; Noble, 2018; Sweeney, 2013), accented speech (Lawrence, 2021; Najaﬁan et al., 2017), and political views (Cohen & Ruths, 2013 Iyyer et al., 2014;Preo¸tiuc-Pietro et al., 2017) to structures of encoded prejudice like proxy-based digital redlining (Cottom, 2016; Friedline et al., 2020) and the perpetuation of harmful stereotyping (Abid et al., 2021; Bommasani et al., 2021; Caliskan et al., 2017; Garrido-Muñoz et al., 2021; Nadeem et al., 2020; Weidinger et al., 2021). A lack of interpretability in complex computational models whose performant causal and predictive properties could draw opaquely on secreted discriminatory biases or patterns of inequity is therefore ethically intolerable. As Wallach (2018) observes: the use of black box predictive models in social contexts ... [raises] a great deal of concern—and rightly so—that these models will reinforce existing structural biases and marginalize historically disadvantaged populations ... we must [therefore] treat machine learning for social science very differently from the way we treat machine learning for, say, handwriting recognition or playing chess. We cannot just apply machine learning methods in a black-box fashion, as if computational social science were simply computer science plus social data. We need transparency. We need to prioritize interpretability—even in predictive contexts. (p. 44) (cf. Lazer et al., 2020, p. 1062) 4.2.4 Challenges Related to Research Integrity Challenges related to research integrity are rooted in the asymmetrical dynamics of resourcing and inﬂuence that can emerge from power imbalances between the CSS research community and the corporations and government agencies upon whom CSS scholars often rely for access to the data resources, compute infrastructures, project funding opportunities, and career advancement prospects they need for their professional subsistence and advancement. Such challenges can manifest, inter alia, in the exercise of research agenda-setting power by private corporations and governmental institutions, which set the terms of project funding schemes and data sharing agreements, and in the willingness of CSS researchers to produce insights and tools that support scaled behavioural manipulation and surveillance infrastructures. These threats to the integrity of CSS research activity manifests in a cluster of potentially unseemly alignments and conﬂicts of interest between its own community of practice and those platforms, corporations, and public bodies who control access to the data resources and compute infrastructures upon which CSS researchers depend (Theocharis & Jungherr, 2021). First, there is the potentially unseemly alignment between the extractive motives of digital platforms, which monetise, monger, and link their vast troves of personal data and marshal inferences derived from these to classify, mould, and behaviourally nudge targeted data subjects, and the professional motivations CSS researchers who desire to gain access to as much of this kind of social big data as possible (Törnberg & Uitermark, 2021). A similar alignment can be seen between the motivations of CSS researchers to 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 77 accumulate data and the security and control motivations of political bodies, which collect large amounts of personal data from the provision and administration of essential social goods and services often in the service of such motivations (Four- cade & Gordon, 2020). There is also a potentially unseemly alignment between the epistemic leverage and sociotechnical capabilities desired by private corporations and political bodies interested in scaled behavioural control and manipulation and the epistemic leverage and sociotechnical capabilities cultivated, as a vocational raison d’être, by some CSS researchers who build predictive tools. This alignment is made all-the-more worrying by the asymmetrical power dynamics that can be exercised by the former organisations over the latter researchers, who not only are increasingly reliant on private companies and governmental bodies for essential data access and computing resources but are also increasingly the obliged beneﬁciaries of academic-corporate research partnerships and academic-corporate “dual-afﬁliation” career trajectories that are funded by large tech corporations (Roberge et al., 2019). Finally, there is a broader scale cultural alignment between the way that digital platforms and tech companies pursue their corporate interests through technology practices that privilege considerations of strategic control, market creation, and efﬁciency and that are thereby functionally liberated from the constraints of social licence, democratic governance, and considerations of the interests of impacted people (Feenberg, 1999, 2002) and the way that CSS scholars can pursue of their professional interests through research practices similarly treated as operationally autonomous and independent from the societal conditions they impact and the governance claims of affected individuals and communities. 4.2.5 Challenges Related to Research Equity Challenges related to research equity fall under two categories: (1) inequities that arise within the outputs of CSS research in virtue of biases that crop up within its methods and analytical approaches and (2) inequities that arise within the wider ﬁeld of CSS research that result from material inequalities and capacity imbalances between different research communities. Challenges emerging from the ﬁrst category include the potential reinforcement of digital divides and data inequities through biased sampling techniques that render digitally marginalised groups invisible as well as potential aggregation biases in research results that mask meaningful differences between studied subgroups and therefore hide the existence of real-world inequities. Challenges emerging from the second category include exploitative data appropriation by well-resourced researchers and the perpetuation of capacity divides between research communities, both of which derive from long- standing dynamics of regional and global inequality that may undermine reciprocal sharing and collaboration between researchers from more and less resourced geographical areas, universities, or communities of practice. Issues of sampling or population bias in CSS datasets extracted from social media platforms, internet use, and connected devices arise when the sampled population 78 D. Leslie that is being studied differs from the larger target population in virtue of the non-random selection of certain groups into the sample (Hargittai, 2015, 2020; Hollingshead et al., 2021; Mehrabi et al., 2021; Olteanu et al., 2019; Tufekci, 2014). It has been widely observed that people do not select randomly into social media sites like Twitter (Blank, 2017; Blank & Lutz, 2017), MySpace (boyd, 2011), Facebook (boyd, 2011; Hargittai, 2015), and LinkedIn (Blank & Lutz, 2017; Hargittai, 2015). As Hargittai (2015) shows, in the US context, people with greater educational attainment and higher income were more likely to be users of Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn than others of less privilege. Hargittai (2020) claims, more generally, that “big data derived from social media tend to oversample the views of more privileged people” and people who possess greater levels of “internet skill”. Earlier studies and surveys have also demonstrated that, at any given time, “different user demographics tend to be drawn to different social platforms” (Olteanu et al., 2019), with men and urban populations signiﬁcantly over-represented among Twitter users (Mislove et al., 2011) and women over-represented on Pinterest (Ottoni et al., 2013). The oversampling of self-selecting privileged and dominant groups, and the under-sampling or exclusion of members of other groups who may lack technical proﬁciency, digital resources, or access to connectivity, for example, large portions of elderly populations (Friemel, 2016; Haight et al., 2014; Quan-Haase et al., 2018), can lead to an inequitable lack of representativity in CSS datasets—rendering those who have been left out of data collection for reason of accessibility, skills, and resource barriers “digitally invisible” (Longo et al., 2017). Such sampling biases can cause deﬁciencies in the ecological validity of research claims (Olteanu et al., 2019), impaired performance of predictive models for non-majority subpopulations (Johnson et al., 2017), and, more broadly speaking, the failure of CSS models to generalise from sampled behaviours and opinions to the wider population (Blank, 2017; Hargittai & Litt, 2012; Hollingshead et al., 2021). This hampered generalisability can be especially damaging when the insights and results of CSS models, which oversample privileged subpopulations and thus disadvantage those missing from datasets, are applied willy-nilly to society as a whole and used to shape the policymaking approaches to solving real-world problems. As Hollingshead et al. (2021) put it, “the ethical concern here is that, as policymakers and corporate stakeholders continue to draw insights from big data, the world will be recursively fashioned into a space that reﬂects the material interests of the inﬁnitely connected” (p. 173).7 Another research inequity that can crop up within CSS methods and analytical approaches is aggregation bias (Mehrabi et al., 2021; Suresh & Guttag, 2021). This occurs when a model’s analysis is applied in a “one-size-ﬁts-all” manner to 7 A similar and compounding form of sampling bias can occur when survey data is linked, through participant consent, to digital trace data from social media networks. Here the dynamic of non- random self-selection manifests in the select group of research subjects (likely those who are privileged and young and more frequently male) who have social media accounts and who consent to having them linked to the survey research (Al Baghal et al., 2020; Stier et al., 2020). 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 79 subpopulations that have different conditional distributions, thereby treating the results as “population-level trends” that map inputs to outputs uniformly across groups despite their possession of diverging characteristics (Hollingshead et al., 2021; Suresh & Guttag, 2021). Such aggregation biases can lead models to ﬁt optimally for dominant or privileged subpopulations that are oversampled while underperforming for groups that lack adequate representation. These biases can also conceal patterns of inequity and discrimination that are differentially dis- tributed among subpopulations (Barocas & Selbst, 2016; boyd & Crawford, 2012; Hollingshead et al., 2021; Longo et al., 2017; Olteanu et al., 2019), consequently entrenching or even augmenting structural injustices that are hidden from view on account of the irresponsible statistical homogenisation of target populations. A different set of research inequities arise within the wider ﬁeld of CSS research as a consequence of material inequalities and capacity imbalances that exist between different research communities. Long-standing dynamics of global inequality, for instance, may undermine reciprocal sharing between research col- laborators from high-income countries (HICs) and those from low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) (Leslie, 2020). Given asymmetries in resources, infrastructure, and research capabilities, data sharing between LMICs and HICs, and transnational research collaboration, can lead to inequity and exploitation (Bezuidenhout et al., 2017; Leonelli, 2013; Shrum, 2005). That is, data originators from LMICs may put immense amounts of effort and time into developing useful datasets (and openly share them) only to have their countries excluded from the beneﬁts derived by researchers from HICs who have capitalised on such data in virtue of greater access to digital resources and compute infrastructure (World Health Organization, 2022). Moreover, data originators from LMICs may generate valuable datasets that they are then unable to independently and expeditiously utilise for needed research, because they lack the aptitudes possessed by researchers from HICs who are the beneﬁciaries of arbitrary asymmetries in education, training, and research capacitation (Bull et al., 2015;Merson et al., 2015). This can create a twofold architecture of research inequity wherein the beneﬁts of data production and sharing do not accrue to originating researchers and research subjects and the scientists from LMICs are put in a position of relative disadvantage vis-à-vis those from HICs whose research efﬁcacy and ability to more rapidly convert data into insights function, in fact, to undermine the efforts of their disadvantaged research partners (Bezuidenhout et al., 2017;Crane, 2011). It is important to note, here, that such gaps in research resources and capabilities also exist within HICs where large research universities and technology corporations (as opposed to less well-resourced universities and companies) are well positioned to advance data research given their access to data and compute infrastructures (Ahmed & Wahed, 2020). In redressing these access barriers, emphasis must be placed on “the social and material conditions under which data can be made useable, and the multiplicity of conversion factors required for researchers to engage with data” (Bezuidenhout et al., 2017, p. 473). Equalising know-how and capability is a vital counterpart to equalising access to resources, and both together are necessary preconditions 80 D. Leslie of just research environments. CSS scholars engaging in international research collaborations should focus on forming substantively reciprocal partnerships where capacity-building and asymmetry-aware practices of cooperative innovation enable participatory parity and thus greater research access and equity. 4.3 Incorporating Habits of Responsible Research and Innovation into CSS Practices The foregoing taxonomy of the ﬁve main ethical challenges faced by CSS is intended to provide CSS researchers with a critical lens that enables them to sharpen their ﬁeld of vision so that they are equipped to engage in the sort of anticipatory reﬂection which roots out irresponsible research practices and harmful impacts. However, circumvention of the potential endurance of “research fast and break things” attitudes requires a deeper cultural transformation in the CSS community of practice. It requires the end-to-end incorporation of habits of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) into all its research activities. An RRI perspective provides CSS researchers with an awareness that all processes of scientiﬁc discovery and problem-solving possess sociotechnical aspects and ethical stakes. Rather than conceiving research as independent from human values, RRI regards these activities as ethically implicated social practices. For this reason, such practices are charged with a responsibility for critical self-reﬂection about the role that these values play both in discovery, engineering, and design processes and in considerations of the real-world effects of the insights and technologies that these processes yield. Those who have been writing on the ethical dimension of CSS for the past decade have emphasised the importance of precisely these kinds of self-reﬂective research practices (for instance, British Sociological Association, 2016; Eynon et al., 2017 Franzke et al., 2020; Hollingshead et al., 2021; Lomborg, 2013; Markham & Buchanan, 2012;Moreno et al., 2013; Weinhardt, 2020). Reacting to recent miscarriages of research ethics that have undermined public trust, such as the 2016 mass sharing of sensitive personal information that had been extracted by researchers from the OKCupid dating site (Zimmer, 2016), they have stressed the need for “a bottom-up, case-based approach to research ethics, one that emphasizes that ethical judgment must be based on a sensible examination of the unique object and circumstances of a study, its research questions, the data involved, and the expected analysis and reporting of results, along with the possible ethical dilemmas arising from the case” (Lomborg, 2013, p. 20). What is needed to operationalise such a “bottom-up, case-based approach to research ethics” is the development across the CSS community of habits of RRI. In this section, we will explore how CSS practices can incorporate habits of RRI, focusing, in particular, on the role that contextual considerations, anticipatory reﬂection, public engagement, and justiﬁable action should play across the research lifecycle. 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 81 Building on research in Science and Technology Studies and Applied Technology Ethics, the RRI view of “science with and for society” has been transformed into helpful general guidance in such interventions as Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)’s 2013 AREA framework8 and the 2014 Rome Declaration9 (Fisher & Rip, 2013; Owen, 2014; Owen et al., 2012, 2013; Stilgoe et al., 2013; von Schomberg, 2013). More recently, EPSRC’s AREA principles (anticipate, reﬂect, engage, act) have been extended into the ﬁelds of data science and AI by the CARE & Act Framework (consider context, anticipate impacts, reﬂect on purposes, positionality, and power, engage inclusively, act responsibly and transparently) (Leslie, 2020; Leslie et al., 2022b). The application of the CARE & Act principles to CSS aims to provide a handy tool that enables its researchers to continuously sense check the social and ethical implications of their research practices and that helps them to establish and sustain responsible habits of scientiﬁc investigation and reporting. Putting the CARE & Act Framework into practice involves taking its several guiding maxims as a launching pad for continuously reﬂective and deliberate choice-making across the research workﬂow. Let us explore each of these maxims in turn. 4.3.1 Consider Context The imperative of considering context enjoins CSS researchers to think diligently about the conditions and circumstances surrounding their research activities and outputs. This involves focusing on the norms, values, and interests that inform the people undertaking the research and that shape and motivate the reasonable expectations of research subject and those who are likely to be impacted by the research and its results: How are these norms, values and interests inﬂuencing or steering the project and its outputs? How could they inﬂuence research subjects’ meaningful consent and expectations of privacy, conﬁdentiality, and anonymity? How could they shape a research project’s reception and impacts across impacted communities? Considering context also involves taking into account the speciﬁc domain(s), geographical location(s), and jurisdiction(s) in which the research is situated and reﬂecting on the expectations of affected stakeholders that derive these speciﬁc contexts: How do the existing institutional norms and rules in a given domain or jurisdiction shape expectations regarding research goals, practices, and outputs? How do the unique social, cultural, legal, economic, and political environments in which different research projects are embedded inﬂuence the conditions of data generation, the intentions and behaviours of the research subjects 8 https://www.ukri.org/about-us/epsrc/our-policies-and-standards/framework-for-responsible- innovation/ 9 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/rome-declaration-responsible-research-and- innovation-europe 82 D. Leslie that are captured by extracted data, and the space of possible inferences that data analytics, modelling, and simulation can yield? The importance of responsiveness to context has been identiﬁed as signiﬁcant in internet research ethics for nearly two decades (Buchanan, 2011; Markham, 2006) and has especially been emphasised more recently in the Internet Research: Ethical Guidelines 3.0 of the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR), where the authors stress that a “basic ethical approach” involves focussing on “on the ﬁne-grained contexts and distinctive details of each speciﬁc ethical challenge” (Franzke et al., 2020,p. 4).10 For Franzke et al., such a process- and context-oriented approach ... helps counter a common presumption of “ethics” as something of a “one-off” tick-box exercise that is primarily an obstacle to research. On the contrary ... taking on board an ongoing attention to ethics as inextricably interwoven with method often leads to better research as this attention entails improvements on both research design and its ethical dimensions throughout the course of a project. (pp. 4–5) This ongoing attention entails a keen awareness of the need to “respect people’s values or expectations in different settings” (Eynon et al., 2017) as well as the need to acknowledge cultural differences, ethical pluralism, and diverging interpretations of moral values and concepts (Capurro, 2005, 2008; C.M.Ess, 2020; Hongladarom & Ess, 2007; Leslie et al., 2022a). Likewise, contextual considerations need to include a recognition of interjurisdictional differences in legal and regulatory requirements (for instance, variations in data protection laws and legal privacy protections across regions and countries whence digital trace data is collected). All in all, contextual considerations should, at minimum, track three vectors: The ﬁrst involves considering the contextual determinants of the condition of the produc- tion of the research (e.g., thinking about the positionality of the research team, the expectations of the relevant CSS community of practice, and the external inﬂuences on the aims and means of research by funders, collaborators, and providers of data and research infrastructure). The second involves considering the context of the subjects of research (e.g., thinking about research subjects’ reasonable expectations of gainful obscurity and “privacy in public” and considering the changing contexts of their communications such as with whom they are interacting, where, how, and what kinds of data are being shared). The third involves considering the contexts of the social, cultural, legal, economic, and political environments in which different research projects are embedded as well as the historical, geographic, sectoral, and jurisdictional speciﬁcities that conﬁgure such environments (e.g., thinking about the ways different social groups—both within and between cultures—understand and deﬁne key values, research variables, and studied concepts differently as well as the ways that these divergent understandings place limitations on what computational approaches to prediction, classiﬁcation, modelling, and simulation can achieve). 10 It is important to note that the importance of contextual considerations has also been present in earlier versions of the AoIR guidelines which date back two decades (Internet Research Ethics— IRE 1.0, 2002; Internet Research Ethics-IRE 2.0, 2012). 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 83 4.3.2 Anticipate Impacts The imperative of anticipating impacts enjoins CSS researchers to reﬂect on and assess the potential short-term and long-term effects their research may have on impacted individuals (e.g., research participants, data subjects, and the researchers themselves) and on affected communities and social groups, more broadly. The purpose of this kind of anticipatory reﬂection is to safeguard the sustainability of CSS projects across the entire research lifecycle. To ensure that the activities and outputs of CSS research remain socially and environmentally sustainable and support the sustainability of the communities they affect, researchers must proceed with a continuous responsiveness to the real-world impacts that their research could have. This entails concerted and stakeholder-involving exploration of the possible adverse and beneﬁcial effects that could otherwise remain hidden from view if deliberate and structured processes for anticipating downstream impacts were not in place. Attending to sustainability, along these lines, also entails the iterative re-visitation and re-evaluation of impact assessments. To be sure, in its general usage, the word “sustainability” refers to the maintenance of and care for an object or endeavour over time. In the CSS context, this implies that building sustainability into a research project is not a “one-off” affair. Rather, carrying out an initial research impact assessment at the inception of a project is only a ﬁrst, albeit critical, step in a much longer, end-to-end process of responsive re-evaluation and re-assessment. Such an iterative approach enables sustainability-aware researchers to pay continuous attention both to the dynamic and changing character of the research lifecycle and to the shifting conditions of the real-world environments in which studies are embedded. This demand to anticipate research impacts is not new in the modern academy— especially in the biomedical and social sciences, where Institutional Review Board (IRB) processes for research involving human subjects have been in place for decades (Abbott & Grady, 2011;Grady, 2015). However, the novel human scale, breadth, and reach of CSS research, as well as the new (and often subtler) range of potential harms it poses to impacted individuals, communities, and the biosphere, call into question the adequacy of conventional IRB processes (Metcalf & Crawford, 2016). While the latter have been praised a necessary step forward in protecting the physical, mental, and moral integrity of human research subjects, building public trust in science, and institutionalising needed mechanisms for ethical oversight (Resnik, 2018), critics have also highlighted their unreliability, superﬁciality, narrowness, and inapplicability to the new set of information hazards posed by the processing of aggregated big data (Prunkl et al., 2021; Raymond, 2019). A growing awareness of these deﬁciencies has generated an expanding inter- est in CSS-adjacent computational disciplines (like machine learning, artiﬁcial intelligence, and computational linguistics) to come up with more robust impact assessment regimes and ethics review processes (Hecht et al., 2021; Leins et al., 2020; Nanayakkara et al., 2021). For instance, in 2020, the NeurIPS (Neural 84 D. Leslie Information Processing Systems) conference introduced a new ethics review pro- tocol that required paper submissions to include an impact statement “discussing the broader impact of their work, including possible societal consequences—both positive and negative” (Neural Information Processing Systems Conference, 2020). Informatively, this protocol was converted into a responsible research practices checklist in 2021 (Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021) after technically oriented researchers protested that they lacked the training and guidance needed to carry out impact assessments effectively (Ashurst et al., 2021; Johnson, 2020; Prunkl et al., 2021). Though there has been recent progress made, in both AI and CSS research communities, to integrate some form of ethics training into professional development (Ashurst et al., 2020; Salganik & The Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science, n.d.) and to articulate guidelines for anticipating ethical impacts (Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022), there remains a lack of institutionalised instruction, codiﬁed guidance, and professional steward- ship for research impact assessment processes. As an example, conferences such as International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, ICWSM (2022); International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML (2022); North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, NAACL (2022); and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP ((2022) each require some form of research impact evaluation and ethical consideration, but aside from directing researchers to relevant professional guidelines and codes of conduct (e.g., from the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL; Association for Computing Machinery, ACM; and Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, AAAI), there is scant direction on how to operationalise impact assessment processes (Prunkl et al., 2021). What is missing from this patchwork of ethics review requirements and guidance is a set of widely accepted procedural mechanisms that would enable and stan- dardise conscientious research impact assessment practices. To ﬁll this gap, recent research into the governance practices needed to create responsible data research environments has called for a coherent, integrated, and holistic approach to impact assessment that includes several interrelated elements (Leslie, 2019, 2020; Leslie et al., 2021; Leslie et al., 2022c, 2022d, 2022e): • Stakeholder analysis: Diligent research impact assessment practices should include processes that allows researchers to identify and evaluate the salience and contextual characteristics of individuals or groups who may be affected by, or may affect, the research project under consideration (Mitchell et al., 2017; Reed et al., 2009; Schmeer, 1999; Varvasovszky & Brugha, 2000). Stakeholder analysis aims to help researchers understand the relevance of each identiﬁed stakeholder to their project and to its use contexts. It does this by providing a structured way to assess the relative interests, rights, vulnerabilities, and advantages of identiﬁed stakeholders as these characteristics may be impacted by, or may impact, the research. • Establishment of clear normative criteria for impact assessment: Effective research impact assessment practices should start from a clear set of ethical 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 85 values or human rights criteria against which the potential impacts of a project on affected individuals and communities can be evaluated. Such criteria should provide common but non-exclusive point of departure for collective delibera- tion about the ethical permissibility of the research project under considera- tion. Adopting common normative criteria from the outset enables reciprocally respectful, sincere, and open discussion about the ethical challenges a research project may face by helping to create a shared vocabulary for informed dialogue and impact assessment. Such a common starting point also facilitates deliberation about how to balance ethical values when they come into tension. • Methodical evaluation of potential impacts: The actual research impact assess- ment process provides an opportunity for research teams (and engaged stakehold- ers, where deemed appropriate) to produce detailed evaluations of the potential and actual impacts that the project may have, to contextualise and corroborate potential harms and beneﬁts, to make possible the collaborative assessment of the severity of potential adverse impacts identiﬁed, and to facilitate the co-design of an impact mitigation plan. • Impact mitigation planning: Once impacts have been evaluated and the severity of any potential harms assessed, impact prevention and mitigation planning should commence. Diligent impact mitigation planning begins with a scoping and prioritisation stage. Research team members (and engaged stakeholders, where appropriate) should go through all the identiﬁed potential adverse impacts and map out the interrelations and interdependencies between them as well as surrounding social factors (such as contextually speciﬁc stakeholder vulnerabil- ities and precariousness) that could make impact mitigation more challenging. Where prioritisation of prevention and mitigation actions is necessary (for instance, where delays in addressing a potential harm could reduce its remedia- bility), decision-making should be steered by the relative severity of the impacts under consideration. As a general rule, while impact prevention and mitigation planning may involve prioritisation of actions, all potential adverse impacts must be addressed. When potential adverse impacts have been mapped out and organised, and mitigation actions have been considered, the research team (and engaged stakeholders, where appropriate) should begin co-designing an impact mitigation plan (IMP). The IMP will become the part of your transparent reporting methodology that speciﬁes the actions and processes needed to address the adverse impacts which have been identiﬁed and that assign responsibility for the completions of these tasks and processes. As such, the IMP will serve a crucial documenting function. • Establishment of protocols for re-visitation and re-evaluation of the research impact assessment: Research impact assessments must pay continuous attention both to the dynamic and changing character of the research lifecycles and to the shifting conditions of the real-world environments in which research practices, results, and outputs are embedded. There are two sets of factors that should inform when and how often initial research impact assessments are re- visited to ensure that they remain adequately responsive to factors that could present new potential harms or signiﬁcantly inﬂuence impacts that have been 86 D. Leslie previously identiﬁed: (1) research workﬂow and production factors: Choices made at any point along the research workﬂow may affect the veracity of prior impact assessments, leading to a need for re-assessment, reconsideration, and amendment. For instance, research design choices could be made that were not anticipated in the initial impact assessment (such choices might include adjusting the variables that are included in the model, choosing more complex algorithms, or grouping variables in ways that may impact speciﬁc groups); (2) environmental factors, changes in project-relevant social, regulatory, policy, or legal environments (occurring during the time in which the research is taking place) may have a bearing on how well the resulting computational model works and on how the research outputs impact affected individuals and groups. Likewise, domain-level reforms, policy changes, or changes in data recording methods may take place in the population of concern in ways that affect whether the data used to train the model accurately portrays phenomena, populations, or related factors in an accurate manner. 4.3.3 Reﬂect on Purposes, Positionality, and Power The foregoing elements of research impact assessment presuppose that the CSS researchers who undertake them also engage in reﬂexive practices that scrutinise the way potential perspectival limitations and power imbalances can exercise inﬂuence on the equity and integrity of research projects and on the motivations, interests, and aims that steer them. The imperative of reﬂecting on purposes, positionality, and power makes explicit the importance of this dimension of inward-facing reﬂection. All individual human beings come from unique places, experiences, and life contexts that shape their perspectives, motivations, and purposes. Reﬂecting on these contextual attributes is important insofar as it can help researchers understand how their viewpoints might differ from those around them and, more impor- tantly, from those who have diverging cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds and life experiences. Identifying and probing these differences enables individual researchers to better understand how their own backgrounds, for better or worse, frame the way they see others, the way they approach and solve problems, and the way they carry out research and engage in innovation. By undertaking such efforts to recognise social position and differential privilege, they may gain a greater awareness of their own personal biases and unconscious assumptions. This then can enable them to better discern the origins of these biases and assumptions and to confront and challenge them in turn. Social scientists have long referred to this site of self-locating reﬂection as “posi- tionality” (Bourke, 2014; Kezar, 2002; Merriam et al., 2001). When researchers take their own positionalities into account, and make this explicit, they can better grasp how the inﬂuence of their respective social and cultural positions potentially creates research strengths and limitations. On the one hand, one’s positionality— with respect to characteristics like ethnicity, race, age, gender, socioeconomic status, 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 87 education and training levels, values, geographical background, etc.—can have a positive effect on an individual’s contributions to a research project; the uniqueness of each person’s lived experience and standpoint can play a constructive role in introducing insights and understandings that other team members do not have. On the other hand, one’s positionality can assume a harmful role when hidden biases and prejudices that derive from a person’s background, and from differential privileges and power imbalances, creep into decision-making processes undetected and subconsciously sway the purposes, trajectories, and approaches of research projects.11 4.3.4 Engage Inclusively While practices of inward-facing reﬂection on purposes, positionality, and power can strengthen the reﬂexivity, objectivity, and reasonableness of CSS research activities (D’Ignazio & Klein, 2020; Haraway, 1988; Harding, 1992, 1995, 2008, 2015), practices of outward-facing stakeholder engagement and community involve- ment can bolster a research project’s legitimacy, social license, and democratic governance as well as ensure that its outputs will possess an appropriate degree of public accountability and transparency. A diligent stakeholder engagement process can help research teams to identify stakeholder salience, undertake team positionality reﬂection, and facilitate proportionate community involvement and input throughout the research project workﬂow. This process can also safeguard the equity and the contextual accuracy of impact assessments and facilitate appropriate end-to-end processes of transparent project governance by supporting their iterative re-visitation and re-evaluation. Moreover, community-involving engagement pro- cesses can empower the public and the CSS community alike by introducing the transformative agency of “citizen science” into research processes (Albert et al., 2021; Sagarra et al., 2016; Tauginien˙eet al., 2020). It is important to note, however, that all stakeholder engagement processes can run the risk either of being cosmetic or tokenistic tools employed to legitimate research projects without substantial and meaningful participation or of being insufﬁciently participatory, i.e., of being one-way information ﬂows or nudging exercises that serve as public relations instruments (Arnstein, 1969; Tritter & McCallum, 2006). To avoid such hazards of superﬁciality, CSS researchers should shore up a proportionate approach to stakeholder engagement through deliberate 11 When taking positionality into account, researchers should reﬂect on their own positionality matrix. They should ask: to what extent do my personal characteristics, group identiﬁcations, socioeconomic status, educational, training, and work background, team composition, and insti- tutional frame represent sources of power and advantage or sources of marginalisation and disadvantage? How does this positionality inﬂuence my (and my research team’s) ability to identify and understand affected stakeholders and the potential impacts of my project? For details on this process see Leslie et al. (2022b). 88 D. Leslie and precise goal setting. Researchers should prioritise the establishment of clear and explicit stakeholder engagement objectives. Relevant questions to pose in establishing these goals include Why are we engaging with stakeholders? What do we envision the ideal purpose and the expected outcomes of engagement activities to be? How can we best drawn on the insights and lived experience of participants to inform and shape our research?12 4.3.5 Act Transparently and Responsibly The imperative of acting transparently and responsibly enjoins CSS researchers to marshal the habits of Responsible Research and Innovation cultivated in the CARE processes to produce research that prioritises data stewardship and that is robust, accountable, fair, non-discriminatory, explainable, reproducible, and replicable. While the mechanisms and procedures which are put in place to ensure that these normative goals are achieved will differ from project to project (based on the speciﬁc research contexts, research design, and research methods), all CSS researchers should incorporate the following priorities into their governance, self-assessment, and reporting practices: • Full documentation of data provenance, lineage, linkage, and sourcing: This involves keeping track of and documenting both responsible data management practices across the entire research lifecycle, from data extraction or procurement and data analysis, cleaning, and pre-processing to data use, retention, deletion, and updating (Bender & Friedman, 2018; Gebru et al., 2021; Holland et al., 2018). It also involves demonstrating that the data is ethically sourced, responsibly linked, and legally available for research purposes (Weinhardt, 2020) and making explicit measures taken to ensure data quality (source integrity and measurement accuracy, timeliness and recency, relevance, sufﬁciency of quantity, dataset representativeness), data integrity (attributability, consistency, completeness, contemporaneousness, traceability, and auditability), and FAIR data (ﬁndable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable). • Full documentation of privacy, conﬁdentiality, consent, and data protection due diligence: This involves demonstrating that data has been handled securely and responsibly from beginning to end of the research lifecycle so that any potential breaches of conﬁdentiality, privacy, and anonymity have been prevented and any risks of re-identiﬁcation through triangulation and data linkage mitigated. Regardless of the jurisdictions of data collection and use, researchers should aim to optimally protect the rights and interests of research subjects by adhering to the highest standards of privacy preservation, data protection, and responsible data handling and storage such as those contained in the IRE 3.0 and the National 12 An elaboration on the essential components of a responsible stakeholder engagement process can be found in Leslie et al. (2022b). 4 The Ethics of Computational Social Science 89 Committee for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and the Humanities (NESH) guidelines (Franzke et al., 2020; National Committee for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and the Humanities (NESH), 2019). They should also demonstrate that they have sufﬁciently taken into account contextual factors in meeting the privacy expectations of observed research subjects (like who is involved in observed interactions, how and what type of information is exchanged, how sensitive it is perceived to be, and where and when such exchanges occur). Documentation should additionally include evidence that researchers have instituted proportionate protocols for attaining informed and meaningful consent that are appropriate to the speciﬁc contexts of the data extraction and use and that cohere with the reasonable expectations of targeted research subjects. • Transparent and accountable reporting of research processes and results and appropriate publicity of datasets: Research practices and methodological con- duct should be carried out deliberately, transparently, and in accordance with recording protocols that enable the interpretability, reproducibility, and replica- bility of results. For prediction models, the documentation protocols presented in Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) provide a good starting point for best conduct guidelines in research reporting (Collins et al., 2015; Moons et al., 2015).13 Following TRIPOD, transparent and accountable reporting should demonstrate diligent methodological conduct across all stages and elements of research. For prediction models, this includes clear descriptions of research participants, predictors, outcome variables, sample size, missing data, statistical analysis methods, model speciﬁcation, model performance, model validation, model updating, and study limitations. While transparent research conduct can facilitate reproducibility and replicability, concerns about the privacy and anonymity of research subjects should also factor into how training data, models, and results are made available to the scientiﬁc community. This notwithstanding, CSS researchers should prioritise the publication of well-archived, high-quality, and accessible datasets that enable the replication of results and the advancement of further research (Hollingshead et al., 2021). They should also pursue research design, analysis, and reporting in an interpretability-aware manner that prioritises process transparency, the understandability of models, and the accessibility and explainability of the rationale behind their results. • An end-to-end process for bias self-assessment: This should cover all research stages as well as all sources of biases that could arise in the data; in the data collection; in the data pre-processing; in the organising, categorising, describing, annotating, structuring of data (text-as-data, in particular); and in research design and execution choices. Bias self-assessment processes should cover social, statistical, and cognitive biases (Leslie et al., 2022a). An end-to-end process 13 Though the TRIPOD method is intended to be applied in the medical domain, its reporting protocols are largely applicable to CSS studies. 90 D. Leslie for bias self-assessment should move across the research lifecycle, pinpointing speciﬁc forms of social, statistical, and cognitive bias that could arise at each stage (for instance, social biases like representation bias and label bias as well as statistical biases like missing data bias and measurement bias could arise in the data pre-processing stage of a research project). 4.4 Conclusion This chapter has explored the spectrum of ethical challenges that CSS for policy faces across the myriad possibilities of its application. It has further elaborated on how these challenges can be met head-on only through the adoption of habits of RRI that are instantiated in end-to-end governance mechanisms which set up practical guardrails throughout the research lifecycle. As a quintessential social impact science, CSS for policy holds great promise to advance social justice, human ﬂourishing, and biospheric sustainability. However, CSS is also an all-too- human science—conceived in particular social, cultural, and historical contexts and pursued amidst intractable power imbalances, structural inequities, and potential conﬂicts of interest. Its proponents, in both research and policymaking communities, must thus remain continuously self-critical about the role that values, interests, and power dynamics play in shaping mission-driven research. Likewise, they must vigilantly take heed of the complicated social and historical conditions surrounding the generation and construction of data as well as the way that the activities and theories of CSS researchers can function to reformat, reorganise, and shape the phenomena that they purport only to measure and analyse. Such a continuous labour of exposing and redressing the often-concealed interdependencies that exist between CSS and the social environments in which its research activities, subject matters, and outputs are embedded will only strengthen its objectivity and ensure that its impacts are equitable, ethical, and responsible. Such a human-centred approach will make CSS for policy a “science with and for society” second-to-none. References Abbott, L., & Grady, C. (2011).

Part II Methodological Aspects Chapter 5 Modelling Complexity with Unconventional Data: Foundational Issues in Computational Social Science Magda Fontana and Marco Guerzoni Abstract The large availability of data, often from unconventional sources, does not call for a data-driven and theory-free approach to social science. On the contrary, (big) data eventually unveil the complexity of socio-economic relations, which has been too often disregarded in traditional approaches. Consequently, this paradigm shift requires to develop new theories and modelling techniques to handle new types of information. In this chapter, we ﬁrst tackle emerging challenges about the collection, storage, and processing of data, such as their ownership, privacy, and cybersecurity, but also potential biases and lack of quality. Secondly, we review data modelling techniques which can leverage on the new available information and allow us to analyse relationships at the microlevel both in space and in time. Finally, the complexity of the world revealed by the data and the techniques required to deal with such a complexity establishes a new framework for policy analysis. Policy makers can now rely on positive and quantitative instruments, helpful in understanding both the present scenarios and their future complex developments, although profoundly different from the standard experimental and normative framework. In the conclusion, we recall the preceding efforts required by the policy itself to fully realize the promises of computational social sciences. M.

Guerzoni 5.1 Introduction We deﬁne CSS as the development and application of computational methods to complex, typically large-scale, human (sometimes simulated) behavioural data (Lazer et al., 2009). The large availability of data, the development of both algorithms and new modelling techniques, and the improvement of storage and computational power opened up a new scientiﬁc paradigm for social scientists willing to take into account the complexity of the social phenomena in their research. In this chapter, we develop the idea that the key transformation in place concerns two speciﬁc self-reinforcing events: • (Big) data unveil the complexity of the world and pull for new modelling techniques • New modelling techniques based on many data push the development of new tools in data science. We do not share the view that this vast availability of data can allow science to be purely data-driven as in a word without theory (Anderson, 2008;Prensky, 2009). On the contrary, as other authors suggested, science needs more theory to account for the complexity of reality as revealed by the data (Carota et al., 2014; Gould, 1981; Kitchin, 2014; Nuccio & Guerzoni, 2019) and develop new modelling techniques. Obviously, in this age of abundance of information, data analysis occupies a privileged position and can eventually debate with the theory on a level playing ﬁeld as it has never happened before. Social sciences are not yet fully equipped to deal with this paradigm shift towards a quantitative, but positive, analysis. Indeed, economics developed an elegant, but purely normative, approach, while other social sciences, when not colonized by the economics’ mainstream positive approach, remained mainly qualitative. Consequently, this present shift can have a profound impact on the way researchers address research questions and, ultimately, also on policy questions. However, before this scientiﬁc paradigm unravels its potential, it needs to wind up any uncertainty about its process, speciﬁcally around the following issues: • Data as the input of the modelling process. There are three levels of data- related issues: – How to collect the data and from which sources. – Data storage which relates with ownership, privacy, and cybersecurity. – Data quality and biases in data and data collection. • New modelling techniques for new data, which account for heterogeneous, networked, geo-located, and time-stamped data. • Policy as the output of the process, namely, the type of policy questions that can be addressed, e.g. positive vs. normative and prediction vs. causality. The chapter is organized as follows: Sect. 5.2 frames the topic in the existing literature; Sect. 5.3 addresses the main issues that revolve around the making 5 Modelling Complexity with Unconventional Data 109 of computational social sciences (data sources, modelling techniques, and policy implications); and Sect. 5.4 discusses and concludes. 5.2 Existing Literature Starting from the late 1980s, sciences have witnessed the increasing inﬂuence of complex system analyses. Far from a mechanistic conception of social and economic systems, complex systems pose several challenges to policy making: • They are comprised of many diverse parts, and, therefore, the use of a represen- tative individual is of no avail (Arthur, 2021). • They operate on various temporal and spatial scales. It follows that the system behaviour cannot be derived from the mere summation of the behaviour of individual components(Arthur, 2021). • They operate out of balance, where minor disturbances may lead to events of all dimensions. Thus, most of equilibrium-based theoretical framework used to devise (economic) policy does not apply (Bonabeau, 2002; Fontana, 2012). In the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2008, the idea that social systems were more complex than what was so far assumed spreads in the policy1 domain. Mean- while, the European Union has been placing an increasing focus on complexity- based projects: “In complex systems, even if the local interactions among the various components may be simple, the overall behaviour is difﬁcult and sometimes impossible to predict, and novel properties may emerge. Understanding this kind of complexity is helping to study and understand many different phenomena, from ﬁnancial crises, global epidemics, propagation of news, connectivity of the internet, animal behaviour, and even the growth and evolution of cities and companies. Mathematical and computer-based models and simulations, often utilizing various techniques from statistical physics are at the heart of this initiative” (Complexity Research Initiative for Systemic InstabilitieS). Furthermore, a growing theoreti- cal literature and the related empirical evidence (Loewenstein & Chater, 2017; Lourenço et al., 2016) spur policy makers to gradually substitute the rational choice framework with the behavioural approach that stresses the limitations in human decision-making. This change in ontology brings about a whole set of new policy features and, subsequently, new modelling challenges. Firstly, since local interaction of heterogeneous agents (consumers, households, states, industries) 1 See also J. Landau, Deputy Governor of the Bank of France “Complex systems exhibit well- known features: non-linearity and discontinuities (a good example being liquidity freezes); path dependency; sensitivity to initial conditions. Together, those characteristics make the system truly unpredictable and uncertain, in the Knightian sense. Hence the spectacular failure of models during the crisis: most, if not all, were constructed on the assumption that stable and predictable (usually normal) distribution probabilities could be used to describe the different states of the ﬁnancial system and the economy. They collapsed when extreme events occurred with a frequency that no one ever thought would be possible”(Cooper, 2011). 110 M. Fontana and M. Guerzoni shapes the overall behaviour and performance of systems, ABMs are used to model the heterogeneity of the system’s elements and describe their autonomous interaction. ABMs are computer simulations in which a system is modelled in terms of agents and their interactions (Bonabeau, 2002). Agents, which are autonomous, make decision on the basis of a set or rules and, often, adapt their action to the behaviour of other agents. ABM is being used to inform policy or decisions in various contexts. Recent examples include land use and agricultural policy (Dai et al., 2020), ecosystems and natural resource management (González et al., 2018), control of epidemics (Kerr et al., 2021; Truszkowska et al., 2021), economic policy (Chersoni et al., 2022; Dosietal., 2020), institutional design (Benthall & Strandburg, 2021), and technology diffusion (Beretta et al., 2018). Moreover, ABM rely on the idea that information does not ﬂow freely and homogeneously within systems and they often connect the policy domain to the ﬁeld of network science (Kenis & Schneider, 2019). The position of an agent (a state, a ﬁrm, a decision- maker) within the network determines its ability to affect its neighbours and vice versa, while the overall structure of the network of agent’s connection determines both how rapidly a signal travels the network and its resilience to shocks(Sorenson et al., 2006). Although social network analysis was initiated in the early years of the twentieth century, the last two decades have built on the increased availability of data and of computational resources to inaugurate the study of complex networks, i.e. those networks whose structure is irregular and dynamic and whose units are in the order of millions of nodes (Boccaletti et al., 2006). In the policy perspective, spreading and synchronization processes have a pivotal importance. The diffusion of a signal in a network has been used to model processes such as the diffusion of technologies and to explore static and dynamic robustness (Grassberger, 1983)to the removal of central or random nodes. It is worth noting that ABM and networks can be used jointly. Beretta et al. (2018) use ABM and network to show that cultural dissimilarity in Ethiopian Peasant Associations could impair the diffusion of a subsidized efﬁcient technology, while Chersoni et al. (2021) use agent-based modelling and network analysis to simulate the adoption of technologies under different policy scenarios showing that the diffusion is very sensitive to the network topology. Secondly, the abandonment of the rational choice framework renders the mathematical maximization armoury ineffective and calls for new modelling approaches. The wide range of techniques that fall under the big tent of adaptive behaviours have a tight connections with data and algorithms. In addition to the heuristic and statistical models of behaviour, recent developments have perfected machine learning and evolutionary computation. These improve the representation of agents both by identifying patterns of behaviour in data and also by modelling agents’ adaptation in simulations (Heppenstall et al., 2021; Runck et al., 2019). By providing agents with the ability to elaborate different data sources to adapt to their environment and to evolve the rules that are the most suitable response to a given set of inputs, machine learning constitutes an interesting tool to overcome the Lucas’ critique. That is to say that it allows modelling individual adjustments to policy making, without renouncing the observed heterogeneity of agents and their dispersed interaction. 5 Modelling Complexity with Unconventional Data 111 Thirdly, the information required to populate these models are not (only) the traditional socio-demographic and national account data but is more diverse and multifaceted. 5.3 Addressing Foundational Issues of CSS for Policy The development and application of CSS implies a rethinking of the approach to policy making. The increased availability of data provides institutions with abundant information that broadens the spectrum of practicable interventions. Yet, the recognition that economic, social, and ecologic systems are complex phenomena imposes a rethinking of the modelling techniques and of the evaluation of their output. A further layer of complexity is that of data management. While traditional data are collected through institutional channels, new data sources require protocols to establish data ownership and privacy protection. In this section, we propose a three-pronged framework to develop an efﬁcient approach to CSS. 5.3.1 Data as the Input of the Process There are two main sources of data in the modelling process. On the one hand, the wide application of smart technologies in an increasing number of realms of social and economic life made the presence of sensors ubiquitous: For instance, they record information for machines on the shop ﬂoor; register pollution, trafﬁc, and weather data in the smart city; and check and store vital parameters of athletes or sick people. On the other hand, the increased amount of activities occurring on the internet allows for detailed registration of the individual’s behaviour with ﬁne-grained details. The extraordinary effort by Blazquez and Domenech (2018) to create a taxonomy of all these possible data sources is a vain one since such an enterprise would require a constant update. However, from their work, it clearly emerges how this new world of data presents peculiar characteristics so far unconventional for the social scientist. • First of all, most of the data collected are at the microlevel, being the unit of analysis about a single person, a ﬁrm, or a speciﬁc machine. • Data are almost always geo-located and time-stamped with a very high precision. In other words, each observation with its attributes occupies a small point in a very dense time-space coordinates. • There is an unprecedented data collection activity with the focus on interactions. We have at disposal for research any information about commercial transactions among both individuals and ﬁrms, which could eventually create a map of the economic activity of a system (Einav & Levin, 2014). At the same time, the advent of social platforms allows to register data on social interactions, which represent the networked world of human relationships. 112 M. Fontana and M. Guerzoni • There are new data on people’s behaviour coming from their searches on search engines, online purchasing activities, and reading and entertainment habits (Bello-Orgaz et al., 2016; Renner et al., 2020). Moreover, the format of data collected is often unconventional. While statistics has been developed to deal with ﬁgures, most of the data available today record texts, images, and videos, only eventually transformed into binary ﬁgures by the process of digitization. These types of data convey new content of a paramount importance for the social scientist since it allows to analyse information about ideas, opinions, and feelings (Ambrosino et al., 2018; Fontana et al., 2019). Thus, different from statistics, which evolved over the last century in time of data scarcity, the present state of the art in the use of data leverages precisely on the vast size of datasets in terms of number of observations, of their attributes, and of different data formats (Nuccio et al., 2020). As a consequence, newly collected data is increasingly stored in the same location, and there is a constant effort to link and merge existing datasets in data warehouses or data lakes. The traditional solution in data science for data storage is a data warehouse, in which data is extracted, transformed, and loaded, while more recently many organizations are opting for a data lake solution, which stores heterogeneously structured raw data from various sources (Ravat & Zhao, 2019). A concurrent and partly connected phenomenon is the widespread adoption of big data analytics as a service (BDaaS), that is, when ﬁrms and institutions rely on cloud services on online platforms for the storage and analysis of data (Aldinucci et al., 2018). As a result, there is an increasing presence of very large online databases. This present situation raises the following challenges to CSS. • The collection, storage, and maintenance of vast datasets create competitive advantages for the private sectors, but it is a very costly process. For these reasons, ﬁrms are not always willing to share their data with third parties involved in research- or data-driven policy making. Moreover, even in the presence of an open approach to data sharing, privacy laws do not always allow it without the explicit authorization of subjects providing the data, as in the case of the European Union GDPR2 (Peloquin et al., 2020; Suman & Pierce, 2018). Public organizations are increasingly digitized and becoming an important hub of data collection of ﬁne-grained data. However, even in the presence of large investments, they often lack adequate human resource and organization capabilities for both the deployment of data warehouse and data lakes and their accessibility for research purposes. • The capacity for investing in data structure and the ability to collect data are very skewed, with few large players owning a tremendous amount of data. Alphabet’s yearly investment in production equipment, facilities, and data centres has been around 10 billion dollars for the last 5 years for the maintenance of about 15 exabytes of data (Nuccio & Guerzoni, 2019). This high concentration 2 GDPR: https://gdpr-info.eu/ 5 Modelling Complexity with Unconventional Data 113 allows a small handful of players to exploit data at a scale incomparable even with the scientiﬁc community. As a result, scientiﬁc institutions need to rely on partnership with these private players to effectively conduct research. • The storage of vast amounts also raises issues in cybersecurity since dataset can become a target for unlawful activities due to the monetary value of detailed and sensitive information. Once again, protection against possible cybersecurity threats requires investment in technologies and human capital which only large ﬁrms possess. The cost and the accountability involved might discourage the use of data for scientiﬁc purposes (Peloquin et al., 2020). The availability of data does not free social science from its original curse, that is, employing data created elsewhere for different purposes than research. Data, even if very large, might not be representative of a population due to biases in the selection of the sample or because they are affected by measurement errors. Typically, data collected on the internet over-represent young cohorts—which are more prone to the use of technology—or rich households and their related socio-demographic characteristics, since they are rarely affected by the digital divide. Alternatively, data might lack some variables which represent the true key of a phenomenon under investigation. Important attributes might be missing because they are not measured (say expectation on the future) or not available for privacy concern (say gender or ethnicity) (Demoussis & Giannakopoulos, 2006; Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008). As an exemplary case for the depth of this problem, consider the widespread debate on the alleged racism of artiﬁcial intelligence. A prediction model might systematically provide biased estimation for individual in a speciﬁc ethnicity class, not because it is racist, but because it might be very efﬁcient in ﬁtting the data provided which (a) describe a racist reality, (b) show (over)under-representation of a speciﬁc ethnic group, and (c) lack important features (typically income) which might be the true explanation of a phenomenon and they are highly correlated with ethnicity. In this case, a model can represent very well the data at disposal, but also its possible distortions. Thus, it will fail in being a correct support for policy making or research. It is thus of a paramount importance to have in place data quality evaluation practices (Corrocher et al., 2021). The next section discusses different methodologies at disposal to deal with this large availability of data. 5.3.2 Modelling Techniques for New Data This availability of data reveals a no longer deniable complexity of the world and opens up for social scientists a vast array of possibilities under the condition that they go beyond “two-variable problem of simplicity” Weaver (1948). We now discuss some theoretical and empirical data techniques which recently reached their mature stage after decades of incubation. As recalled before, data available today are usually at the microlevel, geo-located, time-stamped, and characterized by attributes that described the interaction of the unit of observations both with 114 M. Fontana and M. Guerzoni other observations and with a non-stationary environment. Take, for instance, the phenomena of localization and diffusion. Geospatial data, initially limited to the study of geographical and environmental issues, are currently increasingly available and accessible. These data are highly complex in that they imply the management of several types of information: physical location of the observation and its attributes and, possibly, temporal information. Complexity further increases since such observations change in accordance to the activities taking place in a given location (e.g. resources depletion, ﬁre diffusion, opinion, and epidemic dynamics) and that the agents undertaking those activities are, in turn, changed by the attributes of the location. The main challenge here is the simultaneous modelling of two independent processes: the interaction of the agents acting in a given location and the adaptation of the attributes of both. Any model attempting to grasp these ﬁned- grained dynamic phenomena should account for these properties. Agent-Based Modelling These data are naturally dealt with agent-based modelling and networks. Agent- based modelling describes the system of interest in terms of agents (autonomous individuals with properties, actions, and possibly goals), of their environment (a geometrical, GIS, or network landscape with its own properties and actions), and of agent-agent, agent-environment, and environment-environment interactions that affect the action and internal state of both agents and environment (Wilenski & Rand, 2015). ABMs can be deployed in policy making in several ways. Policy can exploit their ability to cope with complex data, with data and theoretical assumptions (e.g. simulate different diffusion models in an empirical environment), and with interaction and heterogeneity. Literature agrees on two general explanatory mechanisms and three categories of applications. ABMs can be fruitfully applied when there are data or theories on individual behaviour and the overall pattern that emerge from it is unknown, integrative understanding, or when there is information on the aggregate pattern and the individual rules of behaviour are not known— compositional understanding (Wilenski & Rand, 2015). In both cases, ABM offers insights into policy and interventions in a prospective and/or retrospective framework.3 Prospective models simulate the design of policies and investigate their potential effects. Since they rely on non-linear out-of-equilibrium theory, they can help in identifying critical thresholds and tipping points, i.e. small interventions that might trigger radical and irreversible changes in the system of interest (Bak et al., 1987). These are hardly treated with more traditional techniques. The identiﬁcation of early warning signals of impending shifts (Donangelo et al., 2010) relies on the observation of increasing variance and changes in autocorrelation and skewness in time series data; however, traditional data are often too coarse- grained and cover a time window that is too small with respect to the rate of change of the system. Empirically calibrated ABMs instead can simulate long- term dynamics and the related interventions (see, for instance, Gualdi et al. (2015). 3 This classiﬁcation is proposed and discussed at length by Hammond (2015). 5 Modelling Complexity with Unconventional Data 115 When multiple systems are involved—say, the economy and the environment— ABMs map the trade-offs or synergies of policies across qualitatively different systems. Moreover, they are useful to highlight the unintended or unexpected consequences of the interventions, especially when in vivo or in vitro experiments are expensive, unpractical, or unethical. Retrospective models are useful especially under the compositional understanding framework. Firstly, they can investigate why policy have or have not played out the way they were expected to. This is relevant especially when data do not exist. For instance, Chersoni et al. (2021) study the reasons behind the underinvestment in energy-efﬁcient technologies in Europe in spite the EU-wide range of interventions. They start from data on households and simulate their—unobserved—connections to show that policy should account for behavioural and imitative motives beyond the traditional ﬁnancial incentives. While retaining the heterogeneity of observations, ABMs can also reveal different effects of policies across sub-samples of the population. Retrospective models can be used in combination with the prospective ones as input in the policy design process. Network Modelling Policy can exploit the theoretical and empirical mapping provided by network modelling to improve the knowledge of the structure of connections among the elements of the systems of interest, to reinforce the resulting networks, and to guide the processes that unfold on it. Network modelling elaborate on the mapping by computing metrics (e.g. density, reciprocity, transitivity, centralization, and modularity) to characterize the network and to quantify its dimensions. The features associated with those metrics are key to understand the robustness of network to random or target nodes and to study the speed at which a signal travels on it. Once the structure of the network is known, policy makers can design their intervention in order to foster or prevent the processes that are driven by local interactions. For instance, it has been shown that small world networks maximize diffusion (Schilling & Phelps, 2007) and that policy that encourage the formation of distant connections can sustain the production of scientiﬁc knowledge (Chessa et al., 2013). The identiﬁcation of pivotal nodes, on the other hand, allows the design of policy that target the most central or fragile components of the networks. Network modelling also contributes to the identiﬁcation of tipping points and to the elaboration of the required preventive policies. If the elements of the systems are connected through a preferential attachment topology (for instance, the world banking system Benazzoli and Di Persio, 2016), then the system could experience radical and irreversible change if the most central nodes are hit, while it is resilient to random node removals (Eckhoff & Morters, 2013). Explaining, Predicting, and Summarizing That traditional modelling techniques based on optimization naturally suggest simple closed-form equations apt to be tested with econometric techniques does not come as a surprise. The funding father of econometrics Ragnar Frisch clearly emphasized the ancillary role of data analysis in economics with respect to the neoclassical theorizing by stating that econometrics should achieve “the advance- 116 M. Fontana and M. Guerzoni ment of economic theory in its relation to statistics and mathematics” (Cowles, 1960) and not vice versa. However, the complexity of the world now revealed and measured by new data and modelled by networks and ABM pushes for an evolution in the analysis of data. There exist three types of approach in data analysis: causal explanation, prediction, and summarization of the data. Guerzoni et al. (2021) explain that the speciﬁcity of the three approaches with the most severe consequences is the way they deal with external validity. Standard econometrics techniques rely on inference, and the properties of estimators have been derived under strong assumptions on error distribution and for a small class of simple and usually linear models: the focus is on the creation of reliable sample either via experiments or by employing instrumental variables to account for possible endogeneity of the data. As a consequence, econometrics manages to be robust in terms of identifying speciﬁc causal relationships, but at the cost of a reduced model ﬁtness, since simple and mostly linear models are always inappropriate to ﬁt the complexity of the data. Moreover, further issues such as the number of degrees of freedom and multicollinearity reduce the use of a large number of variables. While a scientist might be satisﬁed with sound evidence on casual relationships, for policy making, this is a truly unfortunate situation. Knowing the causal impact of a policy measure on a target variable is surely important, but useless if this impact accounts for a tiny percentage of the overall variation of the target. On the contrary, prediction models measure their uncertainty by looking at the accuracy of prediction on out-of-sample data. There are no restrictions in the type or complexity of the models (or combination of models), and the most advanced data processing techniques such as deep learning can fully displace their power. In this way, the prediction of future scenarios became possible at the expense of eliciting speciﬁc causal effects. The trade-off, known as bias-variance trade-off, is clear: On the one hand, simple econometric models allow us to identify an unbiased sample average response at the cost of inhibiting any accuracy of ﬁtness. On the other hand, complex prediction models reach remarkable level of accuracy, even on the single future observation, but they are silent on speciﬁc causal relations. In this situation, the importance of complex theoretical approaches such as the ABM or network modelling becomes clear. Indeed, predicted result can be used to evaluate the rules of the model and the parameter settings. A complex theoretical model ﬁne- tuned with many data and in line with predictions can be rather safely employed for policy analysis since it incorporates both theoretical insights on causal relationship and a veriﬁed prediction power (Beretta et al., 2018). Lastly, summarizing techniques serve the purpose of classifying and display- ing, often with advanced visualization, properties of the data. Traditionally, the taxonomic approach to epistemology, that is, to create a partition of empirical obser- vations based on their characteristics, has been carried on by a careful qualitative evaluation of data made by the researcher. In the words of most philosophers of science, classiﬁcation is a mean to “bring related items together” (Wynar et al., 1985, p. 317), “putting together like things” (Richardson, 1935); (Svenonius, 2000, p. 10), and “putting together things that are alike” (Vickery, 1975,p. 1) (see Mai, 2011 for a review). Of course, the antecedent of this approach dates back in the 5 Modelling Complexity with Unconventional Data 117 Aristotelian positive approach to science, which describes and compares vis-á-vis Plato’s normative approach (Reale, 1985). More recently, the availability of large dataset made a qualitative approach to the creation of taxonomic possible only at the expense of a sharp a priori reduction of the information in data. However, at the same time, algorithms and computational power allow for an automatic elaboration of the information with the purpose of creating a taxonomy. This approach is known as pattern recognition, unsupervised machine learning, or clustering and has been introduced in science by the anthropologists Driver and Kroeber (1932)and the psychologists Zubin (1938)and Tyron (1939). Typically, unsupervised algorithms are fed by rich datasets in terms of both variables and observations and require as main output the number of groups to be identiﬁed from the researcher. On this basis, as output, they provide a classiﬁcation which minimize within-group variation and maximize between-groups variation, usually captured by some measures of distance in the n-dimensional space of the n variables. Although among these methods in social science the use of K-means algorithm MacQueen et al. (1967) is the most widespread, it has some weaknesses such as a possible dependence by initial condition and the risk of lock-in in local optima. More recently, the self- organizing maps (SOM) (Kohonen, 1990) gained attention as a new method in pattern recognition since they improve on K-means and present other advantages such as a clear visualization of the results.4 Data Analysis for Unconventional Data Sources Also, the large share of unconventional data sources such as texts, images, or videos requires new techniques in the scientist’s toolbox, and the nature of such information is more informative than ﬁgures since it contains ideas, opinions, and judgments. However, as for numerical data, the challenge is to reduce and organize such information in a meaningful way with the purpose of using it for a quantitative analysis, which does not require the time-consuming activity of reading and watching. Concerning text mining, the term “distant reading” attributed to Moretti (2013) could be used as an umbrella deﬁnition encompassing the use of automatic information process for books. The large divide for text mining is between the unsupervised and the supervised approach. The former usually deals with corpora of many documents which need to be organized. Techniques such as topic modelling allow to extrapolate the hidden thematic structure of an archive, that is, they highlight topics as speciﬁc distribution of words which are likely to occur together (Blei et al., 2003). Moreover, they return also the relative distributions of such topics in each document. Thus, at the same time, it is possible to have a bird’s- eye overview on the key concept discussed in an archive, their importance, and when such concepts occur together in the different documents. The exact nature of the topic depends on the exercise at hand and, as in any unsupervised model, is subject to the educated interpretation of the researcher. Ultimately, it is possible 4 For example, in the use of SOM for policy making, see, for instance, Carlei and Nuccio (2014) and Nuccio et al. (2020). 118 M. Fontana and M. Guerzoni also to automatically assign a topic distribution to a new document, evaluate the emergence of new instances and the disappearing of old ones, and monitor how the relative importance of different instances changes over time (Di Caro et al., 2017). Topic modelling has been employed for the analysis of scientiﬁc literature (Fontana et al., 2019), policy evaluation (Wang & Li, 2021), legal documents (Choi et al., 2017), and political writings and speeches (Greene & Cross, 2017). Documents can also come as an annotated text, that is, a text in which words or sentence of a group of documents is associated with a category. For instance, each word can be assigned to a feeling (bad vs. good), an evaluation (positive vs. negative), or an impact (relevant vs. non-relevant). The annotated text can be used as a training dataset to train a model able to recognize and predict the speciﬁc category in new document and analyse them. In this vain, a dataset of annotated tweets returning the feeling of the author can be used to infer the feeling of other users or the average sentiment of a geographical area or a group of people. For instance, Dahal et al. (2019) analyse the sentiment of climate change tweets. 5.3.3 Policy Recommendation as an Output of the Process Based on the above review, it is possible to discuss which policies can be expected as outcome of a data-driven approach. The main theoretical element brought forward in the previous paragraphs consists in the link between the complexity of the world revealed by the data and the techniques require to deal with such a complexity. Such element constitutes the foundation of CSS and establishes the consequences for its use for policy analysis. Precisely, since theoretical models such as ABM and network modelling lack the ability to come forward with simple testable equations, the attempt of deriving clear causal links as tool for policy should be abandoned. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to look back in despair since the ﬁne and elegant armoury of causal identiﬁcation has been developed in a century of scarcity of data and it made the best under such circumstances. However, as discussed above, the use of data was only ancillary to positive theorizing, and such an impoverished use of data science made prediction and quantitative scenario analysis ineffective for the policy maker. Nowadays, the combination of complex modelling with prediction empowers a truly quantitative policy analysis: on the one hand, relation among variables is hypothesized and tested within theoretical, but positive, models taking into account the heterogeneous attributes (also behavioural) of the subjects, the temporal and geographical speciﬁcity, and the dense interactions and feedback in the systems. The ﬁne-tuning of their parameters and accuracy of their prediction are evaluated with supervised algorithms. Moreover, the unsupervised approach allows also for a hypothesis-free and easy-to-visualize exploration of data. Such a positive and quantitative analysis can be helpful in understanding the present scenarios and their future complex development as the result of interactions of complex elements such as in the case of contagion of diseases (Currie et al., 5 Modelling Complexity with Unconventional Data 119 2020), but also the diffusion of ideas, technologies, and information as the aggre- gated manifestation of underlying adoption decisions (Beretta et al., 2018). Note that according to data at the disposal, these results can be achieved either by ﬁne-tuned modelling with micro- and behavioural data, which return predictions on aggregate behaviour, or, on the contrary, by theoretical models which infer micro-behaviour when the model can replicate aggregate results in an exercise of compositional understanding. Economic systems can be also depicted as a complex evolving system, and CSS can describe aggregate ﬂuctuation in economics and ﬁnances by feeding with data at the microlevel ABM models which can predict aggregate ﬂuctuations with much ﬁne accuracy than present DSGE models (Dosi & Roventini, 2019). Predictions aside, these models can easily incorporate heterogeneity of the agents, such as in income distribution or different behavioural routines such as propensity to save for consumers or to invest for entrepreneurs. Finally, the discussion holds not only for policy analysis but also for the corresponding process of policy monitoring and evaluation. The current state of the art in scientiﬁc literature suggests that it is possible to evaluate the single causal impact of a policy, but this is far to be true: even in a controlled policy ﬁeld experiment, it is not possible to estimate the external validity of the results when a pilot policy instrument is deployed at the country level, that is, at a different scale of complexity, or repeated in a slightly different situation in which local attributes are different. 5.4 The Way Forward Data and algorithms applied to CSS can heavily impact upon the way we conceive the process of policy generation. However, the adoption of such tools needs preceding efforts by the policy itself, mainly in the areas of data as an input. The ability of the public infrastructure to gather and store data for many sources calls for investment in technology, human capital, and a legislation that ﬁnd a ﬁne balance between citizens’ right for privacy and a ﬂexible use of the data. The storage and the computational power of large amount of data should not rely on foreign service providers since data should be subject to European regulation. Therefore, policies within the European Data Infrastructure such as the European Open Science Cloud are welcome as well as the high prioritization of technological infrastructure in the European Regional Development Fund.5 Data collected and stored in Europe are subject to the GDPR which is correctly concerned with citizens’ privacy protection. Although art. 89 allows research of certain privileges in data handling, the regulation is silent about the use for research 5 European Data Infrastructure, https://www.eudat.eu/; European Open Science Cloud, https://eosc-portal.eu/; European Regional Development Fund, https://ec.europa.eu/regional_ policy/en/funding/erdf/ 120 M. Fontana and M. Guerzoni of privately gathered data, de facto providing a solid reason to a large private platform not to share their data. This is in area in which the policy maker could intervene with the purpose of facilitating public-private data exchange for achieving the purpose of public interest. The management of data and CSS also requires investments in human capital. The introduction of new professional proﬁles such as data stewards is required to deal with legislation and technical issue related to data, and the introduction of university curricula in data science should be encouraged. Moreover, due to variegated mix of skills that are required to apply CSS, interdisciplinary research should be supported and promoted.

Chapter 6 From Lack of Data to Data Unlocking Computational and Statistical Issues in an Era of Unforeseeable Big Data Evolution Nuno Crato Abstract Reliable cross-section and longitudinal data at national and regional level are crucial for monitoring the evolution of a society. However, data now available have many new features that allow for much more than to just monitor large aggregates’ evolution. Administrative data now collected has a degree of granularity that allows for causal analysis of policy measures. As a result, administrative data can support research, political decisions, and an increased public awareness of public spending. Unstructured big data, such as digital traces, provide even more information that could be put to good use. These new data is fraught with risks and challenges, but many of them are solvable. New statistical computational methods may be needed, but we already have many tools that can overcome most of the challenges and difﬁculties. We need political will and cooperation among the various agents. In this vein, this chapter discusses challenges and progress in the use of new data sources for policy causal research in social sciences, with a focus on economics. Its underlying concerns are the challenges and beneﬁts of causal analysis for the effectiveness of policies. A ﬁrst section lists some characteristics of the new available data and considers basic ethical perspectives. A second section discusses a few computational statistical issues on the light of recent experiences. A third section discusses the unforeseeable evolution of big data and raises a note of hope. A ﬁnal section brieﬂy concludes.

Crato 6.1 Introduction: Data for Causal Policy Analysis A few decades ago, researchers and policymakers would struggle to get access to information. A student in time series would frequently have difﬁculty in getting data with 100 data points. A statistician willing to experiment with novel methods would frequently need to type data by hand, after collecting tables from dozens of print publications. An economist willing to compare the evolution of macroeconomic variables in different countries would need to search for days and would usually get series built with different criteria and with different length. In the mid-1990s, things changed dramatically. Internet started working as an open means for communication and information access, although too many data sets were proprietary, as too many still are, and too often researchers would need to beg statistical ofﬁcers or other researchers for getting appropriate data sets. In parallel to an increasing data availability, a culture of openness spread slowly across countries and ﬁelds of activity. Driven by some governmental and institutional examples, by researcher pressure, and by public political tension, data that would previously be safely hidden in institution’s departments become progressively available to researchers and the public. Scientiﬁc journals could start avoiding systematically one of the obstacles to scientiﬁc reproducibility. Many journals adopted the policy of requiring authors to make data available upon request or by posting the data ﬁles at journals’ websites. In ofﬁcial statistics things started also changing. During the ﬁrst years of the twenty-ﬁrst century, the idea of using conﬁdential microdata for research gained momentum (Jackson, 2019). This recent interest in original highly granular data ofﬁcially collected, in brief, in administrative data, prompted the promise of a revolution in econometrics and social statistics studies.1 Microdata is usually deﬁned as data ‘collected at the individual level of units considered in the database. For instance, a national unemployment database is likely to contain microdata providing information about each unemployed (or employed) person’.2 Modern administrative data provides access to microdata at an unprecedented level. This revolution in studies using administrative data was backed by a scientiﬁc “credibility revolution” in social statistics. Economists Angrist and Pischke (2015) described this “revolution” in empirical economics as the current “rise of a design- based approach that emphasizes the identiﬁcation of causal effects”. In fact, methods such as regression discontinuity, differences in differences, and others, which have been maturing in areas of statistical analysis as different as psychometrics or biometrics, registered a renewed interest as they become recognized as tools for assessing and isolating social variables inﬂuences and for looking for causal factors in overly complex environments. As already expressed in Crato and Paruolo (2019), 1 For additional insights, please refer to the chapter by Signorelli et al. (2023) in the present Handbook. 2 Glossary in Crato and Paruolo (2019, pp. 10–12). 6 From Lack of Data to Data Unlocking 127 this means that “Public policy can derive beneﬁt from two modern realities: the increasing availability and quality of data and the existence of modern econometric methods that allow for a causal impact evaluation of policies. These two fairly new factors mean that policymaking can and should be increasingly supported by evidence”. By the end of the twentieth century, collected data volumes increased in such a way that researchers started using the phrase “big data”. This phrase usually encompasses data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used hardware and software tools to collect, manage, and process them within a reasonable time (Snijders et al., 2012). The expression encompasses unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data; however, the usual focus is on unstructured data (Dedi´c& Stanier, 2017). Administrative data can be considered big data in volume, although usually it is highly structured and so it departs form this common characteristics of the big data classiﬁcation. This distinction is important as unstructured big data is evolving at an incredible speed, and it is by essence varied and difﬁcult to characterize. What may be applicable to a big data set may not be applicable to a different big data set, and things are evolving at such a pace that new applications for big data are appearing every day. Very recently, the Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated the usefulness of new sources of data, such as students’ logins to sites or the search for speciﬁc medical information. It will help our discussion to characterize the types of data we are discussing. 6.1.1 The Variety of Data In this volume, the chapter by Manzan (2023) provides a valuable discussion of various sources of data and how they have been instrumental for advancements of knowledge in several ﬁelds of economics. Our purpose here is more schematic. In Table 6.1, we summarize the characteristics of different data types. For our purposes, it is also interesting to characterize data according to their level of structuring. An attempt appears on Table 6.2. For social research, policy design, and democratic public scrutiny, it is important to have access to as much data as possible, both in volume and variety. This is particularly important for data produced and kept by the public sector. 6.1.2 Underlying Statistical Issue: The Culture of Open Access The idea that information should be available to the public is a democratic and an old one. The following well-known excerpt from James Madison, the father 128 N. Crato Table 6.1 Types of data according to their origin, partially based on Connelly et al.

A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives. More than two centuries later, similar concerns were clearly expressed in a report by President Obama’s executive ofﬁce (The White House, 2014), which considers “data as a public resource” and ultimately recommends that government data should be “securely stored, and to the maximum extent possible, open and accessible” (p. 67). In the European Union, there have been analogous concerns and recommenda- tions. Among other statements, the European Commission has also pledged that, where appropriate, “information will be made more easily accessible” (2016,p. 5). In addition to the issue of public access to nonconﬁdential data, there is the issue of data access for research purposes. This latter issue is an old one, but it took a completely different development in the twenty-ﬁrst century with the rise of two factors: ﬁrstly, the availability of very rich, longitudinal, historically ordered, and granular administrative data; secondly, the development of the so- called counterfactual methods for detecting casual relations among complex social data. In the United States, researcher’s call to access to administrative data reached the National Science Foundation (Card et al., 2010; US Congress, 2016 ; The White House, 2014), which established a Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking, with a composition involving (a) academic researchers and (b) experts on the protection of personally identiﬁable information and on data minimization. Similar developments happened in Europe regarding the use of admin data for policy research purposes, albeit with heterogeneity across states. A few countries, namely, the UK and The Netherlands, already make considerable use of admin data for policy research. The European Commission (2016) issued a directive establishing that data, information, and knowledge should be shared as widely as possible within the Commission and promoting cross-cutting cooperation between the Commission and Member States for the exchange of data, aiming at better policymaking. This research access has been discussed in general terms but has been dominated by policy concerns.3 We are still far from regularly having the disclosure of administrative data and independent systematic analysis of policies. Too often, policy design is based on ideology, group interests, and particular policy matters, 3 In science in general, the disclosure of scientiﬁc data and ideas has also beneﬁted from the digitalization and the internet. The existence of scientiﬁc electronic archives that are nonrefereed and with open access, such as arxiv.org, and a variety of preprint archives is an open culture answer to the scientiﬁc priority concerns, making available data, experimental data, and ideas, is a way to establish priority (Watt, 2022). 130 N. Crato without regard to its efﬁciency in terms of the intended goals. The possibility of measuring the impact of policies and correcting their course is certainly a very valid one and deserves all efforts for opening the access to data. Although it is not clear whether this push for evidence-based policy impact evaluation is changing the panorama of policy design, it certainly is increasingly visible. All these recent developments raise many questions and pose many opportunities and issues. In what follows, I will discuss three particular issues, trying to contribute to speciﬁc relevant policy questions raised by JRC scientists and collected by the editors of the volume in Bertoni et al. (2022). A ﬁrst issue is how to take advantage of the different types of data by adding or consolidating the information available from each type of data set, ideally by linking them. A second issue is the scientiﬁc replicability of studies that access propriety data or data that evolves and are no longer retrievable. A third issue is conﬁdentiality. With access to huge volumes of microdata, sensible personal or organizational information may be spread in a nonethical and undesired way. How can we navigate in this changing sea of opportunities without threatening legitimate privacy rights? These three main issues are tightly linked, as we can see in the following discussion. 6.2 Computational Statistical Issues 6.2.1 Statistical Issues with Merging Big Data In contrast to organized administrative data, nonstructured or loosely structured big data are difﬁcult to link with common probability linkage methods, namely, with those that are used to ﬁx occasional misaligned units (Shlomo, 2019). There are, however, a few promising experiences. A relatively old problem that can beneﬁt from big data corrections is the so- called problem of the “missing rich”, i.e. the paradoxical fact that too often data underestimates the size and wealth of people and families in the upper tail of the income distributions (Lustig, 2020). This has been a well-known problem in household surveys and other type of data collection in various countries. The “missing rich” problem affects many types of data, not only in income distribution.4 The expression now stands for issues that affect upper tails of social statistics, namely, underreporting, under covering and non-responses. For proceeding with estimates corrections, social statisticians have used methods that rely on within survey methods, looking for inconsistencies. More recently, there have been renewed interest in methods that rely on external sources, such as media lists and tax records. Researchers have used both parametric and nonparametric methods for these corrections. Corrections can be made by simple reweighing or 4 See, e. g. Lustig (2020) and the references therein. 6 From Lack of Data to Data Unlocking 131 by adding items. In the ﬁrst case, we are facing a trend to the use of model-based statistics, which have been common in areas as diverse as national statistics and student’s standardized tests. In the second case, we are using selected administrative data linkage, as it has been done for a certain time in France for the EU-SILC survey. Adamiak and Szyda (2021) work provide another example of merging ofﬁcial statistics with unstructured big data. They studied the distribution of worldwide tourism destinations by complementing the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) data with two big data sources: a gridded population database and geo-referenced data on Airbnb accommodation offers. Their results emphasize the predominance of domestic tourism in the global tourism movements, an often-hidden phenomenon, which is revealed by a ﬁner granular analysis of locations and types of tourism preferences. Global statistics with movements across borders cannot reveal the true scale of domestic movements. Other researchers have explored similar big data sources for tracking dynamic changes in almost real time. For monitoring passenger ﬂuxes, hotel stays, and car rentals, various researchers have successfully used booking data, Google searches, mobile device data, remote account logins, card payments, and other similar data. See, e.g. Napierała et al. (2020) and Gallego and Font (2021) aswell asthe work by Romanillos Arroyo and Moya-Gómez (2023) in the present Handbook. Alsunaidi et al. (2021) provide a good synthesis of studies for tracking COVID-19 infections by using big data analysis. The pandemic prompted the surge of big data studies which were useful for estimation or prediction of risk score, healthcare decision-making, and pharmaceutical research and use estimation. Data sources for these studies have been incredibly varied, ranging from body sensors and wearable technology to location data for estimating the spread risks of COVID-19. Additional data sources have been developed and should be most important in a foreseeable future. Among those, activity tracking and health monitoring through smart watches is proving to become an important tool. By using collected disperse data, researchers can now develop real-time diagnosis tools that could be used in the future. In his chapter in this volume, Manzan (2023) provides some other examples of microdata uses. 6.2.2 The Statistical Issue of Replicability and Data Security The pandemic brought startling scientiﬁc advances in medicine and related areas but also in social statistics and in statistics in general. A surprising reality that hit everybody was the uncertainty regarding many factors and variables in the pandemic. In early October 2020, the comparison of various estimates for the rate of Covid-19 spread in the United Kingdom revealed a degree of uncertainty masked by each individual estimate. Figure 6.1 shows the nine estimates considered at the time by the UK Scientiﬁc Pandemic Inﬂuenza Group on Modelling. The point estimates ranged from 1.2 to 1.5, i.e. widely different rates of 132 N. Crato Fig. 6.1 Conﬁdence bands at 90% for estimates for the reproduction rate R of Covid-19 in the UK in October 2022. Graph adapted from Scientiﬁc Pandemic Inﬂuenza Group on Modelling. (2020) growth. Even more startling is the fact that different 90% conﬁdence intervals do not overlap. The estimate represented as the ﬁfth from the left on the graph admitted in the corresponding conﬁdence interval the possibility that the pandemic is receding, while the highest estimate, the seventh on the graph, suggested that 100 people infect 166 others. This example is not unique and similar results have recently been reported in other areas. A recent project in ﬁnance that collectively involved 164 teams tested six hypotheses widely discussed in ﬁnancial economics (Menkveld et al., 2021). The hypotheses were on the existence of trends in the market efﬁciency, the realized bid- ask spread, the gross trading revenue of clients, and other measurable and testable characteristics of the markets. Additionally, used data were the same Deutsche Boerse sample. Reporting the results from different teams, the authors note a sizeable dispersion in results. For the ﬁrst hypothesis, for instance, which was that “market efﬁciency has not changed over time”, the global standard error for the estimate was 20.6%, while the variability across researchers’ estimates was 13.6%. This is certainly non- negligible. The authors of this study propose to make a distinction between the traditional standard errors from parameters estimates, computed by using well-established statistical methods, and what they call “the non-standard errors”, due to variability in methods used by researchers. Along the same lines, a recent article in Nature (Wagenmakers et al., 2022) provides startling examples of different conclusions drawn from the same data with different statistical tools. Consequently, they argue persuasively on the need 6 From Lack of Data to Data Unlocking 133 to contrast different research conclusions obtained through different statistical methods. This would obviously be a particular form of triangulation, a concept worth revisiting. Following the Oxford Bibliography by Drisko (2017), “triangulation in social science refers to efforts to corroborate or support the understanding of an experi- ence, a meaning, or a process by using multiple sources or types of data, multiple methods of data collection, and/or multiple analytic or interpretive approaches”. The concept was arguably ﬁrst introduced by Campbell and Fiske (1959)and usually comprises four types of triangulation identiﬁed by Denzin in the 1970s: (1) data triangulation; (2) investigator triangulation; (3) theory triangulation; and (4) methodological or method triangulation. As a way to apply triangulation and reaching more robust statistical conclusions in social sciences, Aczel et al. (2021) present a “consensus-based guidance” method and argue that a broad adoption of such “multi-analyst approach” can strengthen the robustness of results and conclusions in basic and applied research. Wagenmakers et al. (2021) also argue that limitations of single analysis call for contrasting analyses and recommend seven concrete statistical procedures: (1) visualizing data; (2) quantifying inferential uncertainty; (3) assessing data pre- processing choices; (4) reporting multiple models; (5) involving multiple analysts; (6) interpreting results modestly; and (7) sharing data and code. For our purposes, this seventh recommendation is of paramount importance and consequences. Let us highlight it again: for robustness of statistical inferences in social sciences, it is essential to share data and to share code. These have been practiced for decades in physical sciences. In particular, high-energy physics and astronomy have a long tradition of sharing data and procedures, so that other teams can replicate and corroborate, or contradict the analyses. A similar practice exists in climate research. Why is this such a novelty and odd thing to request in the social sciences? A serious issue, though, is the security of sensitive data. Should data be completely free, easily available upon request, maybe entailing only a responsibility of a sworn statement, or should it be more rigorously restricted? There is no simple answer to this concern. But there are multiple practical solutions. One practical solution is the availability to researchers of veriﬁed scripts only, with which studies could be done. This way, researchers do not deal directly with data and only get the statistical results. There are some inconveniences to this solution, namely, the difﬁculty in accessing data in this step-by-step way, while research usually needs to be done in an interactive way. Another practical solution is the creation of safe environments in which only accredited researchers may have access and in which all interactions with data are recorded. With ethical and peer pressure from the scientiﬁc and technical community, this solution is feasible, although not without risks. As a great provider of reliable data, public authorities should face in a very serious way the issue of safely organizing their data. A governmental example worth following is the X-Road, a centrally created and managed systematic data 134 N. Crato exchanger between information systems. It is extensively used in Estonia5 and followed by Finland in 2017, when the exchange systems from both countries were interconnected. 6.2.3 Statistical Issues Risen by Anonymity Concerns and Related Challenges Privacy is often quoted as the main concern for restricting the use of big data in various settings. This is obviously an important issue, but often shown through biased perspectives. Firstly, it should be highlighted that tax collection, lack of respect for democratic rules in some countries, and the involuntary or unconscious supply of sensitive data to internet-based companies provide a much higher anonymity threat than big data studies operated by researchers following ethical protocols. Secondly, the anonymity issue is often a convenient political pretext for not collecting data, not revealing data, nor assessing the impact analyses of public policies. Thirdly, and most importantly, there are now methods of anonymizing data and realizing studies that do not reveal any personal sensitive data but provide the public with important knowledge about social issues. Other issues are worth noting, namely, information correctness and replicability. Missing data and incorrect data can lead to biased ﬁndings (Richardson et al., 2020). And these incorrect ﬁndings can be replicated and induce larger mistakes. Additionally, data collected by businesses often change the sampling and processing methods and do not report it adequately (Vespe et al., 2021). All these issues are even more serious as they mean that replicability is often difﬁcult and so the scientiﬁc debate can be hindered. As we discuss big data availability and issues, it is obligatory to note that a wealth of administrative data of great use and of technically easy access exists and should be available to researchers and interested citizen groups. In this regard, if there are difﬁculties, they could easily be removed with sufﬁcient governance will. Rossiter (2020) has noted that access to education data is essential for institutions accountability. This could hardly be overstated as education arguably is one of the most important public policies issues and education budgets are among the most important in any country. What is a stake is highly important for a country’s future and for the taxpayer, and what is at stake is the use of substantial public resources. Read and Atinc (2017) listed the availability of education administrative data in 133 low- and middle-income countries and noted that 61 of these have no available data and 43 have only data at the national level. Of the 29 countries that have desegregate data, they were most in non-machine reading format, and only 16 of 5 https://e-estonia.com/solutions/interoperability-services/x-road/ 6 From Lack of Data to Data Unlocking 135 these provide data from student assessment. The consequent limitation can hardly be overstated: student results are the most—some can even say the only—important data regarding any education system. This “underutilization of administrative data” has serious consequences form educational development. As Rossiter (2020) again points out, for many educational decisions ﬁndings cannot be imported. When there are conﬂicting evidence results, in particular, then “non-experimental results from the right context are very often a better guide to policy than experimental results from elsewhere”. We should thus look for solutions. How can we replicate results if data are conﬁdential and restricted to particular groups of researchers? We can address this issue by fostering communities of prac- tice. This way, access to conﬁdential data is guaranteed to trusted researchers under appropriate conditions. This would allow and nudge researchers to independently study the same data set and contrast conclusions. Public and statistical authorities are among those more reticent to this type of data sharing. However, this is the best way to reach robust conclusions that can illuminate policy evaluation and public policy decisions. In case a team of researchers claims that policy X had effect Y, one could ask a team of “research team of veriﬁers” to replicate or reanalyse the data to validate ﬁndings, similarly with what happens in physical sciences. The “research team of veriﬁers” could even be reimbursed, as they provide a public service. But this could be done in exchange of similar work done by others (reciprocity), or as normal peer review work, which is often done for free. In an ideal future, access to non-public administrative data could be regimented in a way that forces varied teams access and varied methods. This happens in public tenders. Why should not data access be granted mandatorily to more than a single research team? This prerequisite for data use would foster social sciences, public policy evaluation, and, ultimately, democracy. Publicly collected data is a public good. A good example to this practice is what has been put in place by some scientiﬁc societies and scientiﬁc journals6: Data sharing is a requirement for paper publication. A simple proposal is as follows. Similarly to what happens in scientiﬁc jour- nals, ofﬁcial analysis of policies impact could have as a normal prerequisite the veriﬁcation by independent researchers. In these cases, the analyses could involve much more computational and teamwork than normal paper refereeing. It would be of public interest that the promoter of the study includes in the initial budget a provision for paying teams of veriﬁers that could constitute an accredited pool. 6 See, e. g. Committee on Professional Ethics of the American Statistical Association (2018). 136 N. Crato 6.3 The Way Forward As discussed in Callegaro and Yang (2018) inter alia, variability is an important characteristic of big data. This means that gathering, analysing, and interpreting big data requires technical expertise that is always evolving. This also means that methods are evolving, and it is difﬁcult or even impossible to have a ﬁxed set of tools that will allow the use and merging of data, when we deal with this particular type of data. Researchers have used relatively old or, at least, well-established techniques such as propensity score analysis, regression discontinuity, and differences-in-differences methods. Another research worth noting is Chen et al. (2020). The authors note that the “challenge of low participation rates and the ever-increasing costs for conducting surveys using probability sampling methods, coupled with technology advances, has resulted in a shift of paradigm”. At this moment, even government statistical agencies need to pay attention to non-probability survey samples, i.e. samples that are not random or that do not derive from a known probabilistic rule. One example is the so-called opt-in panels, for which volunteers are recruited. These authors propose a general framework for statistical inferences with this type of samples, by coupling them with auxiliary information available from a reference probability sample survey. In this setting, they propose a novel procedure for the estimation of propensity scores. All their procedure supposes the availability of high-quality probability sample surveys to allow for the pairing. At this moment, data sources are evolving at such a speedy pace that it is difﬁcult or even impossible to establish general rules. Each data collection method is providing new types of data with different characteristics, different insufﬁciencies, different challenges, and different possibilities. The general rules we may offer are (1) to apply established scientiﬁc rules and methods to the analysis of data and (2) to cross validate conclusions through open science, namely, through data and code sharing. Is this a pessimistic or an optimistic view? I think it is an optimistic one. 6.4 Conclusion This chapter discussed the recent evolution of data existence and use. It contrasted the previous lack of data with the current big data moment, in which we are facing a new issue, the issue of unlocking the power of existing data. There are many types of data that fall under the classiﬁcation of big data. This distinction is important, as methods to access, analyse, and use these types of data are different according to data structure. However, more than a practical issue, the wide use of data by the society is an ethical imperative. As such, this chapter argues 6 From Lack of Data to Data Unlocking 137 that it is our duty as researchers to contribute to ﬁnd ways of overcoming the many existing obstacles to full use of data. There are many technical issues with data use, from anonymity issues to inference issues. This chapter lists some recent experiences and argues that some well-established scientiﬁc practices can be extended to data use and analysis, particularly when data are used for causal inference on policy measures. This can be done without increasing risks to data use and adding beneﬁts to the scientiﬁc quality of the analyses. Scientiﬁc social studies and society will be the great beneﬁciaries.

Chapter 7 Natural Language Processing for Policymaking Zhijing Jin and Rada Mihalcea Abstract Language is the medium for many political activities, from campaigns to news reports. Natural language processing (NLP) uses computational tools to parse text into key information that is needed for policymaking. In this chapter, we introduce common methods of NLP, including text classiﬁcation, topic modelling, event extraction, and text scaling. We then overview how these methods can be used for policymaking through four major applications including data collection for evidence-based policymaking, interpretation of political decisions, policy commu- nication, and investigation of policy effects. Finally, we highlight some potential limitations and ethical concerns when using NLP for policymaking. 7.1 Introduction Language is an important form of data in politics. Constituents express their stances and needs in text such as social media and survey responses. Politicians conduct campaigns through debates, statements of policy positions, and social media. Government staff needs to compile information from various documents to assist in decision-making. Textual data is also prevalent through the documents and debates in the legislation process, negotiations and treaties to resolve international conﬂicts, and media such as news reports, social media, party platforms, and manifestos. Natural language processing (NLP) is the study of computational methods to automatically analyse text and extract meaningful information for subsequent analysis. The importance of NLP for policymaking has been highlighted since the Z.

With the recent success of NLP and its versatility over tasks such as classiﬁcation, information extraction, summarization, and translation (Brown et al., 2020; Devlin et al., 2019), there is a rising trend to integrate NLP into the policy decisions and public administrations (Engstrom et al., 2020; Misuraca et al., 2020;Van Roy et al., 2021). Main applications include extracting useful, condensed information from free-form text (Engstrom et al., 2020), and analysing sentiment and citizen feedback by NLP Biran et al. (2022) as in many projects funded by EU Horizon projects (European Commission, 2017). Driven by the broad applications of NLP (Jin et al., 2021a), the research community also starts to connect NLP with various social applications in the ﬁelds of computational social science (Engel et al., 2021; Lazer et al., 2009;Luz, 2022;Shah et al., 2015) and political science in particular (Glavaš et al., 2019; Grimmer & Stewart, 2013). We show an overview of NLP for policymaking in Fig. 7.1. According to this overview, the chapter will consist of three parts. First, we introduce in Sect. 7.2 NLP methods that are applicable to political science, including text classiﬁcation, topic modelling, event extraction, and score prediction. Next, we cover a variety of cases where NLP can be applied to policymaking in Sect. 7.3. Speciﬁcally, we cover four stages: analysing data for evidence-based policymaking, improving policy communication with the public, investigating policy effects, and interpreting political phenomena to the public. Finally, we will discuss limitations and ethical considerations when using NLP for policymaking in Sect. 7.4.

According to the type of information that we want to extract from the text, we introduce four different NLP tools to analyse text data: text classiﬁcation (by which the extracted information is the category of the text), topic modelling (by which the extracted information is the key topics in the text), event extraction (by which the extracted information is the list of events mentioned in the text), and score prediction (where the extracted information is a score of the text). Table 7.1 lists each method with the type of information it can extract and some example application scenarios, which we will detail in the following subsections. 7.2.1 Text Classiﬁcation As one of the most common types of text analysis methods, text classiﬁcation reads in a piece of text and predicts its category using an NLP text classiﬁcation model, as in Fig. 7.2. Table 7.1 Four common NLP methods, the type of information extracted by each of them, and example applications NLP method Information to extract Example applications Text classiﬁcation Category of text Identify the sentiment, stance, etc. Topic modelling Key topics in text Summarize topics in political agenda Event extraction List of events Extract news events, international conﬂicts Score prediction Score Text scaling News Article Political Perspective StanceCampaign Positive or Negative Sentiment Legislation Issue AreaSpeech International Statement Politicians' Language Language Devices, e.g., Framing Technique Type Text Classification Peaceful or Belligerent Example Applications Usage Text Category NLP Text Classification Model Fig. 7.2 The usage and example applications of text classiﬁcation on political text 144 Z. Jin and R. Mihalcea There are many off-the-shelf existing tools for text classiﬁcation (Brown et al., 2020;Loria, 2018; Yin et al., 2019) such as the implementation1 using the Python package transformers (Wolf et al., 2020). A well-known subtask of text clas- siﬁcation is sentiment classiﬁcation (also known as sentiment analysis or opinion mining), which aims to distinguish the subjective information in the text, such as positive or negative sentiment (Pang & Lee, 2007). However, the existing tools only do well in categories that are easy to predict. If the categorization is customized and very speciﬁc to a study context, then there are two common solutions. One is to use dictionary-based methods, by a list of frequent keywords that correspond to a certain category (Albaugh et al., 2013) or using general linguistic dictionaries such as the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary (Pennebaker et al., 2001). The second way is to adopt the data-driven pipeline, which requires human hand coding of documents into a predetermined set of categories, then train an NLP model to learn the text classiﬁcation task (Sun et al., 2019), and verify the performance of the NLP model on a held-out subset of the data, as introduced in Grimmer and Stewart (2013). An example of adapting the state-of-the-art NLP models on a customized dataset is demonstrated in this guide.2 Using the text classiﬁcation method, we can automate many types of analyses in political science. As listed in the examples in Fig. 7.2, researchers can detect political perspective of news articles (Huguet Cabot et al., 2020), the stance in media on a certain topic (Luo et al., 2020), whether campaigns use positive or negative sentiment (Ansolabehere & Iyengar, 1995), which issue area is the legislation about (Adler & Wilkerson, 2011), topics in parliament speech (Albaugh et al., 2013; Osnabrügge et al., 2021), congressional bills (Collingwood & Wilkerson, 2012; Hillard et al., 2008) and political agenda (Karan et al., 2016), whether the international statement is peaceful or belligerent (Schrodt, 2000), whether a speech contains positive or negative sentiment (Schumacher et al., 2016), and whether a US Circuit Courts case decision is conservative or liberal (Hausladen et al., 2020). Moreover, text classiﬁcation can also be used to categorize the type of language devices that politicians use, such as what type of framing the text uses (Huguet Cabot et al., 2020), and whether a tweet uses political parody (Maronikolakis et al., 2020). 7.2.2 Topic Modelling Topic modelling is a method to uncover a list of frequent topics in a corpus of text. For example, news articles that are against vaccination might frequently mention the topic “autism”, whereas news articles supporting vaccination will be more likely to mention “immune” and “protective”. One of the most widely used models is the 1 https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/new-pipeline-for-zero-shot-text-classiﬁcation/681. 2 https://skimai.com/ﬁne-tuning-bert-for-sentiment-analysis/. 7 Natural Language Processing for Policymaking 145 A Collection of Text Topic Modeling Topic 1 Topic N Topic 2 Multiple Topic Clusters *Each topic is a weighted list of words ... Fig. 7.3 Given a collection of text documents, topic modelling generates a list of topic clusters Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2001) which is available in the Python packages NLTK and Gensim, as in this guide.3 Speciﬁcally, LDA is a probabilistic model that models each topic as a mixture of words, and each textual document can be represented as a mixture of topics. As in Fig. 7.3, given a collection of textual documents, LDA topic modelling generates a list of topic clusters, for which the number N of topics can be customized by the analyst. In addition, if needed, LDA can also produce a representation of each document as a weighted list of topics. While often the number of topics is predetermined by the analyst, this number can also be dynamically determined by measuring the perplexity of the resulting topics. In addition to LDA, other topic modelling algorithms have been used extensively, such as those based on principal component analysis (PCA) (Chung & Pennebaker, 2008). Topic modelling, as described in this section, can facilitate various studies on political text. Previous studies analysed the topics of legislative speech (Quinn et al., 2006, 2010), Senate press releases (Grimmer, 2010a), and electoral manifestos (Menini et al., 2017). 7.2.3 Event Extraction Event extraction is the task of extracting a list of events from a given text. It is a subtask of a larger domain of NLP called information extraction (Manning et al., 2008). For example, the sentence “Israel bombs Hamas sites in Gaza” expresses an event “Israel bombs −−−→ Hamas sites” with the location “Gaza”. Event extraction usually incorporates both entity extraction (e.g. Israel, Hamas sites, and Gaza in the previous example) and relation extraction (e.g. “bombs” in the previous example). Event extraction is a handy tool to monitor events automatically, such as detecting news events (Mitamura et al., 2017;Walker et al., 2006) and detecting international conﬂicts (Azar, 1980; Trappl, 2006). To foster research on event extraction, there are tremendous efforts into textual data collection (McClelland, 3 https://skimai.com/ﬁne-tuning-bert-for-sentiment-analysis/. 146 Z. Jin and R. Mihalcea 1976; Merritt et al., 1993; Raleigh et al., 2010; Schrodt & Hall, 2006; Sundberg & Melander, 2013), event coding schemes to accommodate different political events (Bond et al., 1997;Gerner et al., 2002; Goldstein, 1992), and dataset validity assessment (Schrodt & Gerner, 1994). As for event extraction models, similar to text classiﬁcation models, there are off- the-shelf tools such as the Python packages stanza (Qi et al., 2020)and spaCy (Honnibal et al., 2020). In case of customized sets of event types, researchers can also train NLP models on a collection of textual documents with event annotations (Hogenboom et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020, inter alia). 7.2.4 Score Prediction NLP can also be used to predict a score given input text. A useful application is political text scaling, which aims to predict a score (e.g. left-to-right ideology, emotionality, and different attitudes towards the European integration process) for a given piece of text (e.g. political speeches, party manifestos, and social media posts) (Gennaro & Ash, 2021; Laver et al., 2003;Lowe et al., 2011; Slapin & Proksch, 2008, inter alia). Traditional models for text scaling include Wordscores (Laver et al., 2003) and WordFish (Lowe et al., 2011; Slapin & Proksch, 2008). Recent NLP models represent the text by high-dimensional vectors learned by neural networks to predict the scores (Glavaš et al., 2017b; Nanni et al., 2019). One way to use the NLP models is to apply off-the-shelf general-purpose models such as InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and design a prompt to specify the type of the scaling to the API,4 or borrow existing, trained NLP models if the same type of scaling has been studied by previous researchers. Another way is to collect a dataset of text with hand-coded scales, and train NLP models to learn to predict the scale, similar to the practice in Gennaro and Ash (2021); Slapin and Proksch (2008), inter alia. 7.3 Using NLP for Policymaking In the political domain, there are large amounts of textual data to analyse (NEUEN- DORF & KUMAR, 2015), such as parliament debates (Van Aggelen et al., 2017), speeches (Schumacher et al., 2016), legislative text (Baumgartner et al., 2006; Bevan, 2017), database of political parties worldwide (Döring & Regel, 2019), and expert survey data (Bakker et al., 2015). Since it is tedious to hand-code all textual data, NLP provides a low-cost tool to automatically analyse such massive text. 4 https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction. 7 Natural Language Processing for Policymaking 147 In this section, we will introduce how NLP can facilitate four major areas to help policymaking: before policies are made, researchers can use NLP to analyse data and extract key information for evidence-based policymaking (Sect. 7.3.1); after policies are made, researchers can interpret the priorities among and reasons behind political decisions (Sect. 7.3.2); researchers can also analyse features in the language of politicians when communicating the policies to the public (Sect. 7.3.3); and ﬁnally, after the policies have taken effect, researchers can investigate the effectiveness of the policies (Sect. 7.3.4). 7.3.1 Analysing Data for Evidence-Based Policymaking A major use of NLP is to extract information from large collections of text. This function can be very useful for analysing the views and needs of constituents, so that policymakers can make decisions accordingly. As in Fig. 7.4, we will explain how NLP can be used to analyse data for evidence- based policymaking from three aspects: data, information to extract, and political usage. Data Data is the basis of such analyses. Large amounts of textual data can reveal information about constituents, media outlets, and inﬂuential ﬁgures. The data can come from a variety of sources, including social media such as Twitter and Facebook, survey responses, and news articles. Information to Extract Based on the large textual corpora, NLP models can be used to extract information that are useful for political decision-making, ranging from information about people, such as sentiment (Rosenthal et al., 2015;Thelwall et al., 2011), stance (Gottipati et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2020; Stefanov et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2006), ideology (Hirst et al., 2010; Iyyer et al., 2014;Preo¸tiuc-Pietro et al., 2017), and reasoning on certain topics (Camp et al., 2021; Demszky et al., Information to Extract Classification Data Sentiment Stance Social Media Survey Responses Political Usage Predict Elections Collect Opinions towards Topics or Parties/President/etc. Ideology Events About people: About facts: Topics Get Feedbacks / Increase Engagement Reasoning on Certain Topics About constituents: About media outlets & influential figures: News Social Media Needs Analysis Scaling Topic Model Event Extr. NLP Classification Classification Classification Survey Voters' Views & Needs Fig. 7.4 NLP to analyse data for evidence-based policymaking 148 Z. Jin and R. Mihalcea 2019; Egami et al., 2018), to factual information, such as main topics (Gottipati et al., 2013), events (Ding & Riloff, 2018; Ding et al., 2019; Mitamura et al., 2017; Trappl, 2006), and needs (Crayton et al., 2020; Paul & Frank, 2019; Sarol et al., 2020) expressed in the data. The extracted information cannot only be about people but also about political entities, such as the left-right political scales of parties and political actors (Glavaš et al., 2017b; Slapin & Proksch, 2008), which claims are raised by which politicians (Blessing et al., 2019;Padó et al., 2019), and the legislative body’s vote breakdown for state bills by backgrounds such as gender, rural-urban, and ideological splits (Davoodi et al., 2020). To extract such information from text, we can often utilize the main NLP tools introduced in Sect. 7.2, including text classiﬁcation, topic modelling, event extraction, and score prediction (especially text scaling to predict left-to-right ideology). In NLP literature, social media, such as Twitter, is a popular source of textual data to collect public opinions (Arunachalam & Sarkar, 2013;Pak & Paroubek, 2010; Paltoglou & Thelwall, 2012; Rosenthal et al., 2015; Thelwalletal., 2011). Political Usage Such information extracted from data is highly valuable for political usage. For example, voters’ sentiment, stance, and ideology are important supplementary for traditional polls and surveys to gather information about the constituents’ political leaning. Identifying the needs expressed by people is another important survey target, which helps politicians understand what needs they should take care of and match the needs and availabilities of resources (Hiware et al., 2020). Among more speciﬁc political uses is to understand the public opinion on par- ties/president, as well as on certain topics. The public sentiment towards parties (Pla & Hurtado, 2014) and president (Marchetti-Bowick & Chambers, 2012) can serve as a supplementary for the traditional approval rating survey, and stances towards certain topics (Gottipati et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2020; Stefanov et al., 2020) can be important information for legislators to make decisions on debatable issues such as abortion, taxes, and legalization of same-sex marriage. Many existing studies use NLP on social media text to predict election results (Beverungen & Kalita, 2011; Mohammad et al., 2015; O’Connor et al., 2010; Tjong Kim Sang & Bos, 2012; Unankard et al., 2014). In general, big data-driven analyses can facilitate decision- makers to collect more feedback from people and society, enabling policymakers to be closer to citizens, and increase transparency and engagement in political issues (Arunachalam & Sarkar, 2013). 7.3.2 Interpreting Political Decisions After policies are made, political scientists and social scientists can use textual data to interpret political decisions. As in Fig. 7.5, there are two major use cases: mining political agendas and discovering policy responsiveness. 7 Natural Language Processing for Policymaking 149 Discovering Policy Responsiveness (Alignment of Policies & Public Opinion) Data Mining Political Agenda Data Press Releases Legislation Topics (with Priority) Political Events Electoral Campaigns Event Extr. Topic Model Policy Public Sentiment (Surveys & Social Media) Score Prediction Alignment Classification Politicians' Stances Fig. 7.5 NLP to interpret political decisions Mining Political Agendas Researchers can use textual data to infer a political agenda, including the topics that politicians prioritize, political events, and different political actors’ stances on certain topics. Such data can come from press releases, legislation, and electoral campaigns. Examples of previous studies to analyse the topics and prioritization of political bodies include the research on the prioritization each senator assigns to topics using press releases (Grimmer, 2010b), topics in different parties’ electoral manifestos (Glavaš et al., 2017a), topics in EU parliament speeches (Lauscher et al., 2016) and other various types of text (Grimmer, 2010a; Hopkins & King, 2010;King & Lowe, 2003; Roberts et al., 2014), as well as political event detection from congressional text and news (Nanni et al., 2017). Research on politicians’ stances include identifying policy positions of politi- cians (Laver et al., 2003;Loweet al., 2011; Slapin & Proksch, 2008; Winter & Stewart, 1977, inter alia), how different politicians agree or disagree on certain topics in electoral campaigns (Menini & Tonelli, 2016), and assessment of political personalities (Immelman, 1993). Further studies look into how political interests affect legislative behaviour. Legislators tend to show strong personal interest in the issues that come before their committees (Fenno, 1973), and Mayhew (2004) identiﬁes that senators replying on appropriations secured for their state have a strong incentive to support legislations that allow them to secure particularistic goods. Discovering Policy Responsiveness Policy responsiveness is the study of how policies respond to different factors, such as how changes in public opinion lead to responses in public policy (Stimson et al., 1995). One major direction is that politicians tend to make policies that align with the expectations of their constituents, in order to run for successful re-election in the next term (Canes- Wrone et al., 2002). Studies show that policy preferences of the state public can be a predictor of future state policies (Caughey & Warshaw, 2018). For example, Lax and Phillips (2009) show that more LGBT tolerance leads to more pro-gay legislation in response. A recent study by Jin et al. (2021b) uses NLP to analyse over 10 million COVID- 19-related tweets targeted at US governors; using classiﬁcation models to obtain the public sentiment, they study how public sentiment leads to political decisions of COVID-19 policies made by US governors. Such use of NLP on massive textual 150 Z. Jin and R. Mihalcea Research Questions How Do Politicians Establish Their Images? How Do Constituents Allocate Credit? What Receives Attention in News?

Fig. 7.6 NLP to analyse policy communication data contrasts with the traditional studies of policy responsiveness which span over several decades and use manually collected survey results (Caughey & Warshaw, 2018; Lax & Phillips, 2009, 2012). 7.3.3 Improving Policy Communication with the Public Policy communication is the study to understand how politicians present the policies to their constituents. As in Fig. 7.6, common research questions in policy communication include how politicians establish their images (Fenno, 1978)such as campaign strategies (Petrocik, 1996; Sigelman & Buell Jr, 2004; Simon, 2002), how constituents allocate credit, what receives attention in Congress (Sulkin, 2005), and what receives attention in news articles (Armstrong et al., 2006; McCombs & Valenzuela, 2004; Semetko & Valkenburg, 2000). Based on data from press releases, political statements, electoral campaigns, and news articles,5 researchers usually analyse two types of information: the language techniques politicians use and the contents such as topics and underlying moral foundations in these textual documents. Language Techniques Policy communication largely focuses on the types of lan- guages that politicians use. Researchers are interested in ﬁrst analysing the language techniques in political texts, and then, based on these techniques, researchers can dive into the questions of why politicians use them and what are the effects of such usage. For example, previous studies analyse what portions of political texts are position-taking versus credit-claiming (Grimmer, 2013; Grimmer et al., 2012), 5 Other data sources used in policy communication research include surveys of senate staffers (Cook, 1988), newsletters that legislators send to constituents (Lipinski, 2009), and so on. 7 Natural Language Processing for Policymaking 151 whether the claims are vague or concrete (Baerg et al., 2018; Eichorst & Lin, 2019), the frequency of credit-claiming messages versus the actual amount of contributions (Grimmer et al., 2012), and whether politicians tend to make credible or dishonourable promises (Grimmer, 2010b). Within the political statements, it is also interesting to check the ideological proportions (Sim et al., 2013) and how politicians make use of dialectal variations and code-mixing (Sravani et al., 2021). The representation styles usually affect the effectiveness of policy communi- cation, such as the role of language ambiguity in framing the political agenda (Campbell, 1983; Page, 1976) and the effect of credit-claiming messages on constituents’ allocation of credit (Grimmer et al., 2012). Contents The contents of policy communication include the topics in the political statements, such as what senators discuss in ﬂoor statements (Hill & Hurley, 2002) and what presidents address in daily speeches (Lee, 2008), and also the moral foundations used by politicians underlying their political tweets (Johnson & Goldwasser, 2018). Using the extracted content information, researchers can explore further ques- tions such as whether competing politicians or political elites emphasize the same issues (Gabel & Scheve, 2007; Petrocik, 1996) and how the priorities politicians articulate co-vary with the issues discussed in the media (Bartels, 1996). Another open research direction is to analyse the interaction between newspapers and politicians’ messages, such as how often newspapers cover a certain politician’s message and in what way and how such coverage affects incumbency advantage. Meaningful Future Work Apart from analysing the language of existing political texts that aims to maximize political interests, an advanced question that is more meaningful to society is how to improve policy communication to steer towards a more beneﬁcial future for society as a whole. There is relatively little research on this, and we welcome future work on this meaningful topic. 7.3.4 Investigating Policy Effects After policies are taken into effect, it is important to collect feedback or evaluate the effectiveness of policies. Existing studies evaluate the effects of policies along different dimensions: one dimension is the change in public sentiment, which can be analysed by comparing the sentiment classiﬁcation results before and after policies, following a similar paradigm in Sect. 7.3.1. There are also studies on how policies affect the crowd’s perception of the democratic process (Miller et al., 1990). Another dimension is how policies result in economic changes. Calvo-González et al. (2018) investigate the negative consequences of policy volatility that harm long-term economic growth. Speciﬁcally, to measure policy volatility, they ﬁrst obtain main topics by topic modelling on presidential speeches and then analyse how the signiﬁcance of topics changes over time. 152 Z. Jin and R. Mihalcea 7.4 Limitations and Ethical Considerations There are several limitations that researchers and policymakers need to take into consideration when using NLP for policymaking, due to the data-driven and black-box nature of modern NLP. First, the effectiveness of the computational models relies on the quality and comprehensiveness of the data. Although many political discourses are public, including data sources such as news, press releases, legislation, and campaigns, when it comes to surveying public opinions, social media might be a biased representation of the whole population. Therefore, when making important policy decisions, the traditional polls and surveys can provide more comprehensive coverage. Note that in the case of traditional polls, NLP can still be helpful in expediting the processing of survey answers. The second concern is the black-box nature of modern NLP models. We do not encourage decision-making systems to depend fully on NLP, but suggest that NLP can assist human decision-makers. Hence, all the applications introduced in this chapter use NLP to compile information that is necessary for policymaking instead of directly suggesting a policy. Nonetheless, some of the models are hard to interpret or explain, such as text classiﬁcation using deep learning models (Brown et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2019), which could be vulnerable to adversarial attacks by small paraphrasing of the text input (Jin et al., 2020). In practical applications, it is important to ensure the trustworthiness of the usage of AI. There could be a preference for transparent machine learning models if they can do the work well (e.g. LDA topic models and traditional classiﬁcation methods using dictionaries or linguistic rules) or tasks with well-controlled outputs such as event extraction to select spans of the given text that mention events. In cases where only the deep learning models can provide good performance, there should be more detailed performance analysis (e.g. a study to check the correlation of the model decisions and human judgments), error analysis (e.g. different types of errors, failure modes, and potential bias towards certain groups), and studies about the interpretability of the model (e.g. feature attribution of the model, visualization of the internal states of the model). Apart from the limitations of the technical methodology, there are also ethical considerations arising from the use of NLP. Among the use cases introduced in this chapter, some applications of NLP are relatively safe as they mainly involve analysing public political documents and fact-based evidence or effects of policies. However, others could be concerning and vulnerable to misuse. For example, although effective, truthful policy communication is beneﬁcial for society, it might be tempting to overdo policy communication and by all means optimize the votes. As it is highly important for government and politicians to gain positive public perception, overly optimizing policy communication might lead to propaganda, intrusion of data privacy to collect more user preferences, and, in more severe cases, surveillance and violation of human rights. Hence, there is a strong need for policies to regulate the use of technologies that inﬂuence public opinions and pose a challenge to democracy. 7 Natural Language Processing for Policymaking 153 7.5 Conclusions This chapter provided a brief overview of current research directions in NLP that provide support for policymaking. We ﬁrst introduced four main NLP tasks that are commonly used in text analysis: text classiﬁcation, topic modelling, event extraction, and text scaling. We then showed how these methods can be used in poli- cymaking for applications such as data collection for evidence-based policymaking, interpretation of political decisions, policy communication, and investigation of policy effects. We also discussed potential limitations and ethical considerations of which researchers and policymakers should be aware. NLP holds signiﬁcant promise for enabling data-driven policymaking. In addi- tion to the tasks overviewed in this chapter, we foresee that other NLP applications, such as text summarization (e.g. to condense information from large documents), question answering (e.g. for reasoning about policies), and culturally adjusted machine translation (e.g. to facilitate international communications), will soon ﬁnd use in policymaking. The ﬁeld of NLP is quickly advancing, and close collaborations between NLP experts and public policy experts will be key to the successful use and deployment of NLP tools in public policy.

Chapter 8 Describing Human Behaviour Through Computational Social Science Giuseppe A. Veltri Abstract The possibilities offered by digital and Computational Social Science can improve our understanding of human behaviour as never before. The availability of behavioural data in a society where the digital has been widely adopted is because of two reasons: ﬁrst, the vast amount of digital traces produced by people in their daily lives and related behaviours and, second, the possibility of running online experiments that can cover a large segment of a target population (we have seen online experiments with hundreds of thousands of participants). This chapter will discuss the opportunity offered by online large behavioural experiments. The implications for policymakers of this shift are the possibility of having behavioural insights both across different societies and better understanding and capturing within a country heterogeneity. In other words, large-scale online experiments combined with computational methods allow for unprecedented cognitive and behavioural based segmentation. 8.1 Introduction This chapter describes the role of Computational Social Science in enhancing our understanding of human behaviour. We will highlight the importance of behavioural data compared to the more common self-reported ones and how the increased availability of digital traces of human behaviour is crucial in the new potential analysis. The digital revolution that has affected the social sciences in the past decade or so (e.g. Salganik, 2018; Veltri, 2020) created the context for three possible forms of studies about human behaviour: 1. The use of large online behavioural experiments, which will be the focus of this chapter G. A.

Veltri Fig. 8.1 Different forms of behavioural data available due to the ‘digital revolution’ in the social sciences and the role of CSS in it 2. Similarly to point one, the online has become a large ﬁeld in which natural experiments occur 3. Many digital platforms collect behavioural data of their users and these can be repurposed for social scientiﬁc purposes The amount, type, and complexity of data generated from the three approaches above require innovation from the analytical point of view. This is where Computa- tional Social Science methods are being applied (Fig. 8.1). Finally, we will discuss one promising form of modelling that we believe is particularly relevant for studies of human behaviour and decision-making. Large-scale online experiments can test the behavioural response to intervention and explore the heterogeneity of treatment effects across different social strata helping to tailor differentiated options. The use of computational models to identify subgroups in large datasets is a growing area of interest. Of particular interest is the form of online experiments that combine the lessons learned from online 8 Describing Human Behaviour Through Computational Social Science 165 surveys. The so-called population-based survey experiments or PBSEs aim to address this problem through research design rather than analyses, combining the best aspects of both approaches, capitalizing on their strengths, and eliminating many weaknesses. We will discuss the potential of unstructured data such as text and the use of text mining techniques that, combined with other types of data, can further enrich our understanding of social behaviour. The contribution of Computational Social Science to our understanding of social behaviour is not limited to data availability. However, it includes the opening to analytical approaches developed in computer science, particularly in machine learning, which brings a new ‘culture’ of statistical modelling that bears considerable potential for the social scientist and informs policy harnessing heterogeneity. Segmentation is widely used in decision- making. It is usually based on sociodemographic factors (e.g. age, gender, income, geographical location). However, cognitive and behavioural differences within the population are an important source of variability that needs to be considered in policy design and implementation because how one reacts to a public policy is conditioned by what cognitive and cultural patterns are used by those targeted. The target population is behaviourally and cognitively plural: people vary in how they feel, think, and act. Moreover, each citizen interprets reality according to different cognitive and cultural schemas speciﬁc to the individual and active in the cultural environment. Therefore, public policies need to be designed in ways that allow for the ﬂexibility to take into account differences in the target population and other dimensions (e.g. sociodemographic, linguistic, and so on). 8.2 Data in the Digital World To appreciate the transformative nature of digital data and computational methods in the social sciences, we need to draw some fundamental distinctions between the types of data that social scientists have been dealing with. A great deal of social science research has been produced based on self-reported data. Self-reported data stands for the accounts and reporting people do about their views, psychological states, and behaviours. However, the biggest challenge to self-reported data has come from a shift in the model of human behaviour in the wider social sciences except for psychology. Since the late 1990s, psychologists have distinguished between two systems of thought with different capacities and processes (Kahneman, 2012; Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Lichtenstein & Slovic, 2006; Metcalfe & Mischel, 1999;Sloman, 1996; Smith & DeCoster, 2000), which have been referred to as System 1 and System 2 (Evans & Stanovich, 2013). System 1 (S1) is made up of intuitive thoughts of great capacity, is based on associations acquired through experience and quickly and automatically calculates information. On the other hand, System 2 (S2) involves low-capacity reﬂective thinking based on rules acquired through culture or formal learning and calculates information in a relatively slow and controlled manner. The processes associated with these systems have been deﬁned as Type 1 (fast, automatic, unconscious) and Type 2 166 G. A. Veltri (slow, conscious, controlled), respectively. The so-called dual model of the mind is now the most supported way of understanding human behaviour at the individual level and in continuous evolution (De Neys, 2018). The model has also been applied outside psychology, for example, in sociology (Lizardo et al., 2016; Moore, 2017) and political science (Achen & Bartels, 2017). The implications of Kahneman and Tversky’s work have led to the research programme labelled behavioural economics, which has dramatically impacted traditional microeconomics theory. A more precise human behaviour and decision-making model has implications for social science research methodology, particularly for the distinction between self-reported and observational/behavioural data. The dual mode of thinking brings back the importance of unconscious thought processes and contextual and environ- mental inﬂuences on the latter in the broader context of the social sciences, which is highly problematic in studies only using self-reported measures and instruments. Traditionally, collecting behavioural data has been very difﬁcult and expensive for social scientists. Keeping track of people’s actual behaviour could be done only for small groups of people and for a minimal amount of time. However, the availability of digital data has brought us a signiﬁcant increase in behavioural data; we now have digital traces of people’s actual behaviour that were never available before. The combined effect of a relatively new and powerful foundational model of human behaviour and decision-making offered by the dual model and the availability of behavioural data thanks to the digital traces recorded by a multitude of services and tools is very promising for social scientists. Before continuing this line of argument, let’s clarify one point that might be the object of criticism— considering human behaviour as the outcome of mutual inﬂuences of conscious acting and unconscious heuristics, biases, and environmental inﬂuences are not a return to reductionism. People’s opinions count for nothing. Self-reported data will remain an essential source of information for social scientists, but, at the same time, the availability of behavioural data will function as complementary data to understand complex social phenomena. 8.3 Behavioural Digital Data The distinction between self-reported and behavioural data is no longer mainly theoretical because the new opportunities for collecting the latter are unprecedented. Such an option opens new research opportunities and the possibility of reviewing current theories and existing models. However, the increased availability of col- lecting data about people’s behaviour does not free us from biases generated by the design and aims of digital platforms. People’s behaviour is constrained by the platform they use; for example, it is impossible to write an essay on Twitter unless we decide to write it using many individual tweets. There are, therefore, several potential sources of confounding factors, as we will further elaborate in the section below on construct validity. 8 Describing Human Behaviour Through Computational Social Science 167 Another distinction is relevant about the different levels of analysis: the one between static and dynamic data. The large majority of data collected in the social sciences have been ‘static’—that is, data collection has been carried out at a given time. This is because longitudinal data collection, data collected over some time, was challenging and expensive. Digital data introduce a much-increased capacity for recording and using longitudinal data for social scientiﬁc purposes. Digital data have not been historically around for many decades, but future researchers might have at their disposal longitudinal datasets that were absent in the past. Behavioural digital data are the object of attention of a new generation of social scientists who believe in their potential to regenerate the current theories and framework that were developed in a condition of data scarcity, with different models of human behaviour and using only self-reported data. It is too early to say what changes will bring increased data availability, but this is the most exciting aspect of the use of digital data for social scientiﬁc research. However, the nature of the data collected from the digital world is not without problems, and it poses speciﬁc challenges to researchers. The distinction between self-reported and behavioural data touched brieﬂy on one feature of digital data: their nonreactive nature in terms of data collection. We can distinguish digital data as the outcome of unobtrusive or obtrusive data collection methods (Webb et al., 1966). The distinction between these two data collection modalities is essential in the social sciences because people ‘react’ to researchers’ measurements and can ﬁgure out what a researcher’s goals are. Two of the most common problems are people’s reactions to measurements, the Hawthorne effect and the social desirability effect. The Hawthorne effect, as mentioned before, refers to the fact that individuals modify their behaviour in response to their awareness of being observed. Recent scandals related to social media and privacy, in which users’ data have been harvested for commercial or political campaigning purposes, have made people more conscious that their online behaviour is observed and recorded. Social desirability is the tendency of some respondents to report an answer in a way they deem to be more socially acceptable if they believe they are under observation than would be their ‘true’ answer, where true means aligned to current dominant social norms. They do this to project a favourable image of themselves and to avoid receiving negative evaluations. The outcome of the strategy results in the over-reporting of socially desirable behaviours or attitudes and the under-reporting of socially undesirable behaviours or attitudes (Nederhof, 1985). Social media are particularly affected by social desirability bias because people manage their presence online to generate a positive self-image. This process leads to a positivity bias in the content present on social media (Spottswood & Hancock, 2016). The availability of behavioural data in a society where the digital has been widely adopted is because of two reasons: ﬁrst, the vast amount of digital traces produced by people in their daily lives and related behaviours and, second, the possibility of running online experiments that can cover a large segment of a target population (we have seen online experiments with hundreds of thousands of participants). Next, we 168 G. A. Veltri will discuss the opportunity offered by the online large behavioural experiments, particularly in the form of population-based survey experiments or PBSE. 8.4 Online Population-Based Survey Experiments The limitations of laboratory experiments and the opportunities of the digital as a ﬁeld in which to conduct research have prompted researchers to develop online experiments both in academia and in the private research world. Of particular interest is the form of online experiments that combine lessons learned from online surveys. The aim of so-called population-based survey experiments, or PBSEs (Mutz, 2011), is to address this problem through research design rather than analysis, combining the best aspects of both approaches, capitalizing on their strengths, and eliminating many of their weaknesses. Deﬁned in the most rudimentary terms, a population-based survey experiment is an experiment that is administered to a representative sample of the population. Another common term for this approach is simply ‘survey experiment’, but this abbreviated form can be misleading because it is not always clear what the term ‘survey’ means. The use of survey methods does not distinguish this approach from other combinations of survey and experimental methods. After all, many experiments already involve survey methods in the administration of pre-test and post-test questionnaires, but this is not what is meant here. Population-based survey experiments are not deﬁned by their use of interview techniques, whether written or oral nor by their location in a setting other than a laboratory. Instead, a population- based experiment uses sampling methods to produce a set of experimental subjects that is representative of the target population of interest for a particular theory, whether that population is a country, a state, an ethnic group, or some other subgroup. The population represented by the sample should be representative of the population to which the researcher intends to extend his results. In population-based survey experiments, experimental subjects are randomly assigned to conditions by the researcher, and treatments are administered as in any other experiment. Nevertheless, participants are generally not required to show up in a laboratory to participate. Theoretically, they could, but population-based experiments are inﬁnitely more practical when representative samples are not required to appear in one place. Strictly speaking, population-based survey experiments are more experiments than surveys. By design, population-based experiments are experimental studies that draw on the power of random assignment to establish unbiased causal inferences. They are also administered to randomly selected representative samples of the target population of interest, just as a survey would be. However, population-based experiments do not need (and often have not relied on) nationally representative population samples. The population of interest could be members of a particular ethnic group, parents of children under 18, people who watch television news, or 8 Describing Human Behaviour Through Computational Social Science 169 others. Still, the key is that convenience samples are abandoned in favour of samples representing the target population of interest. The advantage of population-based survey experiments is that theories can be tested on samples that are representative of the populations to which they are said to apply. The downside of this trade-off is that most researchers have little experience administering experimental treatments outside of a laboratory setting, so new techniques and considerations come into play, as (Veltri, 2020) described extensively. In a sense, population-based survey experiments are by no means new; simpliﬁed versions of them have existed since at least the early years of research. However, technological developments in survey research, combined with the development of innovative techniques in experimental design, have made highly complex and methodologically sophisticated population-based experiments increasingly accessible to social scientists from many disciplines. The development of the digital has made implementable the possibilities of population-based experiments. With the diffusion of pre-recruited online panels that are built according to the golden standards of sampling, the ability to exploit such dynamic data collection tools has expanded social scientists’ methodological repertoire and inferential range in many ﬁelds (e.g. Veltri et al., 2020). The many advances in interview technology offer social science researchers the potential to introduce some of its most important hypotheses into virtual laboratories scattered across countries. Whether evaluating theoretical hypotheses, examining the robust- ness of laboratory results, or testing empirical hypotheses of other varieties, the ability of scientists to experiment on large and diverse groups of subjects allows them to address critical social and behavioural phenomena more effectively and efﬁciently. Population-based experiments can be used by social scientists in sociology, political science, psychology, economics, cognitive science, law, public health, communication, and public policy, to name just a few of the main ﬁelds that ﬁnd this approach appealing. Although most social scientists recognize the enormous beneﬁts of experimentation, the traditional laboratory setting is unsuitable for all important research questions. Experiments have always been more prevalent in some social science ﬁelds than in others. To a large extent, the emphasis on experimental versus investigative methods reﬂects a ﬁeld’s emphasis on internal versus external validity, with ﬁelds such as psychology more oriented towards the former and ﬁelds such as political science and sociology more oriented towards the latter. For researchers, population-based experiments provide a means of establishing causality that is unmatched by any large-scale data collection effort, no matter how extensive. Conducting online population-based survey experiments can beneﬁt from the latest development of survey design and, in particular, adaptive survey design or ASD. ASD (Wagner, 2010) is based on the premise that samples are heterogeneous, and the optimal survey protocol may not be the same for each individual. For example, a particular survey design feature such as incentives may appeal to some individuals but not to others (Groves et al., 2000; Groves & Heeringa, 2006), leading to design-speciﬁc response propensity for each individual. Similarly, relative to 170 G. A. Veltri interviewer-administration, a self-administered mode of data collection may elicit less measurement error bias for some individuals but more measurement error bias for others. The general objective in ASD is to tailor the protocol to sample members to improve targeted survey outcomes. The basic premise of adaptive interventions is shared by ASDs—tailoring methods to individuals based on interim outcomes. We label these dynamic adaptive designs to reﬂect the dynamic nature of the optimization and static adaptive designs when they are based solely on information available prior to the start of data collection. A tailoring variable is used to inform the decision to change treatments, such as the type of concerns the sample member may have raised at the contact moment. Decision rules would include the matching of information from the tailoring variables (concerns about time, not worth their effort) to interventions (a shorter version of the task, a larger incentive). Finally, the decision points need to be deﬁned, such as whether to apply the rules and intervene at the time of the interaction or at a given point in the data collection period. What is noteworthy is that either of these approaches and much more complex experimental designs are easily implemented in the context of use of online platforms. The ability to make strong causal inferences has little to do with the laboratory environment itself and much to do with the ability to control the random assignment of people to different experimental treatments. By moving the possibilities of experimentation out of the laboratory in this way, population-based experiments strengthen the internal validity of social science research and provide the potential to interest a much wider group of social scientists in the possibilities of experimentation. Of course, the fact that it can be done outside the laboratory is not itself a good reason to do so. Therefore, we will review some of the key advantages of online population-based experiments, starting with four advantages over traditional laboratory experiments and then ending with some of their more general beneﬁts for accumulating valuable social scientiﬁc knowledge. The main strategic advantage of an online experiment over a laboratory exper- iment is the greater possibility of generalization (external validity), the greater statistical power and possibly the quality of the data produced. Web-based studies, having larger samples, usually have greater statistical power than laboratory studies. Data quality can be deﬁned by variable error, constant error, reliability, or validity. Comparisons of power and some quality measures have found cases where web data are of higher quality for one or other of these deﬁnitions than comparable laboratory data, although not always (Birnbaum, 2004). Many web researchers are convinced that data obtained via the web can be ‘better’ than data obtained from students (Reips, 2002), despite the laboratory’s obvious advantage for control. The main disadvantage of an online experiment compared to a laboratory experiment is the lack of complete environmental control. Participants in online experiments may answer questions and perform behavioural tasks in very different environments (a room with light and silence, versus their own desk at work with less light and surrounded by much noise) and with different equipment (a participant may use a browser that does not display visual stimuli correctly or may have a slow connection, thus delaying task completion and increasing fatigue, frustration and ‘noisy’ responses). Most importantly, as lab assistants do not monitor participants, 8 Describing Human Behaviour Through Computational Social Science 171 there is more chance that they will engage in automatic responses and task completion, which introduces noise into the data. This can be controlled with control questions and is less of a problem for between-subjects design with randomization of treatments and control conditions. Other technical/tactical issues can be controlled for in the online experiment (multiple submissions, drop-outs, self-selection). Still, the main trade-off between online experiments and laboratory is to trade off greater generalizability and power of data for less experimental control. Therefore, it is not surprising that experiments are often repeated with the same outcome measures both online and in the laboratory to check the quality and validity of the data. 8.5 Heterogeneity Analysis and Computational Methods Extending experiments to large samples, both national and international, increases the potential heterogeneity present in response to our treatments. Therefore, iden- tifying and studying such heterogeneity is a crucial step in the world of online behavioural experiments. New analytical techniques have emerged in computational and computer sciences that are very promising to achieve this goal. One of the best examples of how social science can beneﬁt from analytical approaches developed in computational methods is the development of model-based recursive partitioning. This approach improves the use of classiﬁcation and regression trees. The latter also is a method from the ‘algorithmic culture’ of modelling that has valuable applications in the social sciences but is essentially data-driven (Berk, 2006;Hand & Vinciotti, 2003). In summary, classiﬁcation and regression trees are based on a purely data-driven paradigm. Without using a predeﬁned statistical model, such algorithmic methods recursively search for groups of observations with similar response variable values by constructing a tree structure. Thus, they are instrumental in data exploration and express their best utility in the context of very complex and large datasets. However, such techniques make no use of theory in describing a pattern of how the data was generated and are purely descriptive, although far superior to the ‘traditional’ descriptive statistics used in the social sciences when dealing with large datasets. Model-based recursive partitioning (Zeileis et al., 2008) represents a synthesis of a theoretical approach and a set of data-driven constraints for theory validation and further development. In summary, this approach works through the following steps. Firstly, a parametric model is deﬁned to express a set of theoretical assumptions (e.g. through a linear regression). Second, this model is evaluated according to the recursive partitioning algorithm, which checks whether other important covariates that would alter the parameters of the initial model have been omitted. Third, the same regression or classiﬁcation tree structure is produced. This time, instead of partitioning by different patterns of the response variable, model-based recursive partitioning ﬁnds different patterns of associations between the response variable and other covariates that have been pre-speciﬁed in the parametric model. In other 172 G. A. Veltri words, it creates different versions of the parametric model in terms of beta (β) estimation, depending on the different important values of the covariates (for the technical aspects of how this is done, see Zeileis & Hornik, 2007). In other words, the presence of splits indicates that the parameters of the initial theory-driven deﬁnition are unstable and that the data are too heterogeneous to be explained by a single global model. The model does not describe the entire dataset. Classiﬁcation trees look for different patterns in the response variable based on the available covariates. Since the sample is divided into rectangular partitions deﬁned by the values of the covariates and since the same covariate can be selected for several partitions, classiﬁcation trees can also evaluate complex interactions, non-linear and non-monotonic patterns. Furthermore, the structure of the underlying data generation process is not speciﬁed in advance but is determined in an entirely data-driven way. These are the key distinctions between classiﬁcation and regression trees and classical regression models. Model-based recursive partitioning was developed as an advancement of classi- ﬁcation and regression trees. Both methods originate from machine learning, which is inﬂuenced by both statistics and computer science. Classiﬁcation and regression trees are purely data-driven and exploratory—and thus mark the complete opposite of the model speciﬁcation theory approach prevalent in the empirical social sciences. However, the advanced model-based recursive partitioning method combines the advantages of both approaches: at ﬁrst, a parametric model is formulated to represent a theory-driven research hypothesis. Then this parametric model is handed over to the model-based recursive partitioning algorithm, which checks whether other relevant covariates have been omitted that would alter the model parameters of interest. Technically, the tree structure obtained from the classiﬁcation and regression trees remains the same for model-based recursive partitioning. However, the appli- cation of model-based recursive partitioning offers new impulses for research in the social, educational, and behavioural sciences. For the interpretation of model-based recursive partitioning, we would like to emphasize the connection to the principle of parsimony: following the fundamental research paradigm that theories developed in the social sciences must produce falsiﬁable hypotheses, these are translated into statistical models. The aim of model building is thus to simplify complex reality. What is the advantage of having such information? The answer to this question relates to the initial distinction that was introduced about the two modelling cultures. In the predominant (in the social sciences) data modelling culture, comparing different models has always been complex and problematic. The hybrid approach of model-based recursive partitioning modelling can help review models that work for the whole dataset and do not neglect such information that imposes on the models as ‘global’ straitjackets. Furthermore, suppose the researcher in question values the ‘Ockham’s razor’ rule (that a model should not be more complex than necessary but must be complex enough to describe the empirical data). In that case, model-based recursive partitioning can be used to evaluate different models. Another valuable piece of information generated by this approach is that the recursive model-based method allows for identifying particular segments of the 8 Describing Human Behaviour Through Computational Social Science 173 sample under investigation that might merit further investigation. That is, the possibility of identifying segments of our sample (and, therefore, presumably segments of the population if our sample is representative) that have a different version of the general theoretical model we have employed, in the form of statistical regression, to explain a given phenomenon Y. This possibility of identifying ‘local’ models of the population is not just a matter of chance. When applied to independent variables involving the measurement of attitudes and preferences, this possibility of identifying’ local’ models as deﬁned above allows us to identify subgroups characterized by a particular cognitive pattern shared by that group. Such a group could very well be transversal to traditional sociodemographic categories (the young, the old, the middle class, etc.). Applied to experiments, it represents an advanced form of heterogeneity of treatment effects analysis that, with sufﬁcient cases, can be very informative about the presence of general and local effects of a treatment. This approach is very promising but has a ‘cost’ in methodological terms. To work well, it needs large samples and, even better, samples collected in several countries. Only with a sufﬁcient number of cases, we can identify noteworthy subgroups. In contrast, if we have a few hundred cases, we cannot be sure of the statistical validity of the partitioning, besides the fact that we are talking about subgroups consisting of a few tens of cases are uninteresting as results. This brief overview of model-based recursive partitioning illustrates the general point discussed in the previous sections: the complexity, quantity, and availability of digital data have highlighted the need to use analytical approaches other than those considered conventional in the social sciences. Therefore, Computational Social Science is, among other things, an attempt to adapt these new computational techniques and their associated ‘modelling culture’ to the research goals and questions of social scientists (Veltri, 2017). In other words, it is not only a matter of having more data of different types, which is important but also of innovating modelling techniques that can bring about transformative changes in the social sciences. Of course, there will also be methodological problems. Still, the ability to answer old questions with alternative approaches and ask new questions is the most attractive feature of Computational Social Science. 8.6 Conclusions The possibilities offered by the new turn of digital and Computational Social Science can improve our understanding of human behaviour as never before. We move from data scarcity and local studies to potential large- scale, complex, and international ones. The implications for policymakers of this shift are the possibility of having behavioural insights both across different societies and better understanding and capturing within a country heterogeneity. In other words, large-scale online experiments combined with computational methods like the one discussed do allow for unprecedented 174 G. A. Veltri cognitive and behavioural based segmentation (see recent example Steinert et al., 2022). Consequently, such differences can be used to differentiate the population to identify subsets of people, each characterized by a particular cognitive style. Segmentation is usually associated with proﬁling—the description of the relevant characteristics of the identiﬁed segment—sociodemographic characteristics, occu- pational status, geographical and spatial location, health status, attitudes towards essential aspects of the public policy in question. It is clear that cognitive and cultural segmentation also interacts with classical forms of classiﬁcation result- ing from afﬁliations such as occupations, generations, social classes, and status groups. Still, it cannot be taken for granted that they coincide. An example of such cultural segmentation is the analysis of the Brexit vote in the UK and how different cognitive-cultural styles are predictive of that vote (Veltri et al., 2019). Behavioural segmentation is a potential tool for policy development. It is particularly suitable for the ex ante phase because it refers to a segmentation strategy of the target population and during the monitoring of the intervention in progress because it allows identifying the mismatch between the policy objectives and the citizen’s interpretation of the policy. Similarly, cognitive-behavioural segmentation helps both the effectiveness and efﬁciency of policy interventions. In the ﬁrst case, it helps to tailor instruments to the cognitive and cultural variability within the target population. An analogy here is precision medicine, an emerging approach for the treatment and prevention of diseases that considers individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle. In the context of public policy, the unit cannot be the individual but subgroups of the target population that will respond differently to the same public policy intervention. Thus, cognitive and behavioural segmentation plays an important role in improving efﬁciency. It can warn against implementing policy interventions that are likely to be ineffective with speciﬁc subgroups and thus help develop solutions that take cognitive and behavioural speciﬁcities into account. The other great opportunity comes from the use of digital traces and unstructured data. The sheer amount of this type of data provides insights into people’s behaviour. However, because we are repurposing existing data collected for other purposes, some challenges are present. The ﬁrst is entirely methodological: the criterion validity of these data types is still unclear (McDonald, 2005). The second concerns the ethical and privacy dimension of covert research, meaning that people are not often fully aware of the extend of their digital traces and how third-parties use them. Computational Social Science is no longer a complementary addition to or an embellishment in the social scientiﬁc study of society. Instead, it is changing the nature of social research because the digital has changed our societies. This is the starting point, we believe, that should accompany social scientists from now on. 8 Describing Human Behaviour Through Computational Social Science 175 References Achen, C.

Chapter 9 Data and Modelling for the Territorial Impact Assessment (TIA) of Policies Eduardo Medeiros Abstract Territorial Impact Assessment (TIA) is still a ‘new kid on the block’ on the panorama of policy evaluation methodologies. In synthesis, TIA methodologies are thematically holistic and multi-dimensional and require the analysis of a wide pool of data, not only of economic character but also related with social, environmental, governance and planning processes, in all territorial scales. For that, TIA requires a wealth of comparable and updated territorialised data. Here, data availability is often scarce in many of the selected analytic dimensions and respec- tive components, to assess territorial impacts in a given territory, in particular in the domains of governance, planning and environment. In this context, this chapter presents a list of non-traditional potential indicators which can be used in existing TIA methodologies. Moreover, the analysis was able to show how important can be the use of non-traditional data, to complement mainstream statistical indicators associated with socioeconomic development trends. However, for the interested scientist, the dispersal of existing non-traditional data per a multitude of sources can pose a huge challenge. Hence the need of an online platform which centralises and updates non-traditional data for the use of all interested in implementing TIA methodologies. 9.1 Introduction Academia and public and private entities are being ﬂooded with ‘tsunamis’ of traditional and non-traditional data for their research. This data is collected via multichannel business environments (Baesens, 2014) and via, for instance, ‘sensors, smartphones, internet, social media, and administrative systems’.1 The central 1 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research/centre-advanced-studies/css4p E.

(eds.), Handbook of Computational Social Science for Policy, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16624-2_9 177 178 E. Medeiros question for this chapter is how and which available non-traditional data can increase the effectiveness of the Territorial Impact Assessment (TIA) (see Medeiros, 2020b, 2020d) of projects, programmes and policies, via existing or novel TIA methodologies. This chapter is written in a necessary condensed and focused way and is guided by the following three policy questions raised by European Commission (EC) Joint Research Centre (JRC) (Bertoni et al., 2022): 1. How can CSS help evaluate the measure and its territorial impacts, either in an ex ante way (using simulation methods) or in an ex post one (using data science ones)? 2. Which sources of data could be used to better consider EU territorial heterogene- ity? 3. What are the challenges of this approach, for example, how can we establish the correct level of spatial granularity, trading off the optimality of the targeted policy measure with the costs/timeliness of the decision? All these questions are, in our view, relevant and reﬂect emerging axioms on the importance of considering the territorial dimension in analysing and assessing the implementation of policies, at different policy phases (ex ante, mid-term, and ex post), that have begun to permeate the policy evaluation discourse over the past decades. The ﬁrst question provides an insightful emphasis to debate the potential positive and complementary contribution of non-traditional data to analyse all policy phases of TIA, in order to improve its effectiveness. The second aims to identify con- crete sources of non-traditional data which can complement mainstream traditional data when implementing a TIA methodology. This is particularly relevant for TIAs since they should consider a broad and comprehensive set of indicators covering all dimensions and components of territorial development (Medeiros, 2014a). Finally, the third question touches a critical foundation of the implementation of TIAs: how to identify the appropriate territorial level for the TIA analysis and the dimensions and components for the analysed policy, in order to increase the efﬁciency and effectiveness of TIA evaluations. All these questions will be further scrutinised in Sect. 9.3. In this regard, and based on past TIA evaluations (Medeiros, 2014b, 2016a, 2017b), non-traditional data can provide crucial inputs on components related to the territorial governance and spatial planning dimensions of territorial development, which are difﬁcult to obtain via traditional data sources. 9.2 TIA: A Literature Review What is and why TIAs? These fundamental questions are answered in existing literature in various manners, from the ﬁrst known report which unveiled the ﬁrst TIA model (TEQUILA—see ESPON 3.2, 2006), through to a recent book which explains each one of the existing TIA methodologies (Medeiros, 2020d). From the ﬁrst to the last, no more than 15 years have passed. This formally makes TIA methodologies ‘new kids on the block’ of policy evaluation (Medeiros, 2020c). 9 Data and Modelling for the Territorial Impact Assessment (TIA) of Policies 179 Table 9.1 TIA methodologies and main pros and cons Name Pros Cons TEQUILA First TIA.

Even so, current ESPON TIAs are profoundly preconditioned by their erroneous rationale which means it is possible to obtain a valid and sound TIA score in a quick manner (Medeiros, 2016c). Inevitably, any state-of-the-art literature review of TIA methodologies must start with the ﬁrst one: the pioneering quantitative TIA model known as TEQUILA. This multi-criteria model is supported by a quantitative database on EU NUTS 3, to assess ex ante impacts of EU directives. According to the authors of this methodology, the criteria to select the TEQULA data refers to the main dimensions of territorial cohesion, territorial efﬁciency, territorial quality and territorial identity, and their sub-dimensions, measurable by multiple indicators (Camagni, 2020), particularly economic-related ones (Table 9.2). Also devised within the ﬁrst ESPON programme, the STEMA TIA model is based on an original qualitative-quantitative methodological approach, returning ex ante and ex post impact scores. Just like the TEQUILA model, the STEMA uses traditional sources of data, mostly related to the economic dimension of development (Prezioso, 2020). The same goes for the ESPON EATIA (Marot et al., 2020) and the simpliﬁed QUICK_TIA (Ferreira & Verschelde, 2020). Crucially, all these four ESPON TIA models are supported by existing sources of quantitative databases at the EU level (mostly NUTS 2 and 3), collected from several sources and organised in the ESPON database, which has data related to agriculture and ﬁsheries, economy, education, environment and energy, governance, health and safety, information society, labour market, population 180 E.

Soon after the creation of the ﬁrst ESPON TIAs, other TIAs or similar policy assessment methodologies were designed to assess territorial impacts. The ﬁrst was the TARGET_TIA which, unlike the ESPON TIAs, was speciﬁcally designed to assess the ex post impacts of EU Cohesion Policy. Just like the TEQUILA, however, the TARGET_TIA selected the quantitative indicators based on the con- cept of Territorial Cohesion, but with different analytic dimensions (socioeconomic cohesion, territorial governance and cooperation, polycentricity and environmen- tal sustainability). It uses mainly traditional sources of data for socioeconomic and environmental dimensions. This data is complemented with non-traditional statistical sources of data collected for the dimensions of cooperation/governance and polycentrism, in databases like the INTERACT KEEP database and other sources available in different national and EU entities. In the meantime, the TAR- GET_TIA was already tested in speciﬁc EU programmes like the EU INTERREG-A (Medeiros, 2017a). For this case, the selected quantitative data referred to the two main dimensions of cross-border cooperation (territorial development and reduction of border barriers) and respective components. In this regard, it goes without saying that the collection of data on persisting border barriers required the access to non- mainstream sources of data, which are available in distinct regional and national entities. Finally, the two remaining types of TIA methodologies mentioned in this chapter are designed for speciﬁc policy evaluation contexts. The ﬁrst, known as Territorial Foresight, is used when the analysis of long-term developments is required. For this, qualitative data is collected via questionnaires, comprising three elements: content, geography and time (Böhme et al., 2020). Conversely the LUISA model ‘is based on the concept of ‘land function’ for cross-sector integration and for the representation of complex system dynamics’ (Lavalle et al., 2020). It is fundamentally supported by territorial indicators collected from several external models and presented via an online tool: the Urban Data Platform. This means that it explores higher spatial granularities than other TIA tools, since it provides information at the urban level. 9.3 Computational Guidelines on TIA 9.3.1 The Main Contribution of Computational Social Science for Territorial Impact Assessment As seen in the previous section, existing TIA methodologies are supported by traditional sources of quantitative data. These are retrieved from EU national and sometimes regional statistical entities such as the Eurostat, ESPON and JRC databases. In some cases, speciﬁc data is obtained directly from non-mainstream data sources, especially for measuring components associated with governance and 182 E. Medeiros spatial planning dimensions of territorial development. In this context, there is a wide scope for incorporating non-traditional sources of data (see McQueen, 2017) in the implementation of TIA methodologies, in the following domains. 9.3.1.1 Complementarity Territorial impact assessment analysis is generally related to analysing policy impacts on territorial development or territorial cohesion trends. It can, of course, also tackle other policy arenas, such as territorial cooperation or territorial inte- gration (on territoriality, see Medeiros, 2020a). The problem here is that, as a holistic concept, territory encompasses basically all aspects related to the concept of development (Potter, 2008). This scenario implies a constant struggle to ﬁnd, in traditional sources of data, a balanced set of indicators for all the analytical dimensions of, for instance, territorial development (Medeiros, 2019), hence, the potential beneﬁts of usage of non-traditional data (e.g. digital footprint, digital tracking data, etc.) to complement largely incomplete traditional sources of data in implementing a TIA methodology. Here, besides the economic-related pool of statistics, which are normally relatively abundant at several territorial levels, the remaining policy dimensions of development can be enriched by non-traditional sources of data. These include social statistics, like ‘quality of life’ indicators, which often depend on an individual perception, which can be acquired via enquiries made with mobile phones. Furthermore, environmental-related data, such as the potential ‘carbon footprint’ of each individual in a given territory, can be acquired by means of online questionnaires via mobile phones or even by data on road congestion and public transport data. In the latter case, online applications such as the Flightradar24 (ﬂightradar24.com) or the UCL Energy Institute portal to visualise the world’s shipping routes can be used to estimate a carbon footprint impact score for each intended territorial scale. These are just a few examples that can also be applied in other dimensions of territorial development, such as territorial governance (e.g. to identify social engagement and participation in a given domain via the analysis of social network geo-tagged information) and spatial planning (e.g. to determine the compacity of urban areas via the visualisation of Google Maps). 9.3.1.2 Real-Time Information One of the main advantages of non-traditional sources of data is the possibility to analyse territorial ﬂows of data in real time. One aforementioned example is Flightradar24, which presents the current location of all commercial airplanes at any given time. The same goes for data which can be collected from some public transport operators and mobile phone companies tracking the exact location of individuals in a real-time context. This data, once aggregated and anonymised, can be particularly useful, for instance, to assess cross-border ﬂows, which are a 9 Data and Modelling for the Territorial Impact Assessment (TIA) of Policies 183 crucial element to understanding the territorial impacts of cross-border cooperation (Medeiros, 2018), or urban mobility processes (Pucci et al., 2015). 9.3.1.3 Spatial Accuracy Another advantage related to digital tracking is the collection of highly accurate spatial data (Christl & Spiekermann, 2016) which is normally absent in traditional sources of data. However, this data collection should comply with the right of citizens to minimise their digital footprint (Bronskill & McKie, 2016). One domain in which spatial accuracy for TIA is particularly relevant is the analysis of all sorts of ﬂows, especially in urban areas. As Cao (2018) puts it: ‘data science can also fundamentally change the way political policies are made, evaluated, reviewed and adjusted by providing evidence-based informed policy making, evaluation, and governance’. 9.3.2 Sources of Data Towards an Analysis of EU Territorial Heterogeneity I still remember the wise words of a former university professor on research methodologies stating that ‘before you think you will not ﬁnd the data you need, try hard and you will be amazed on what data is out there’. Indeed, data of all kinds and sources is waiting to be found in a myriad of places, to be treated and used in various studies. In the case of TIAs, it would appear reasonable to surmise how important it is to have access to a wide pool of updated and georeferenced data at several territorial levels and at several policy domains. In this regard, the writing of this particular chapter conﬁrmed the premise that it is possible to access a wider pool of data to be used in TIA methodologies, to complement the ones commonly available in traditional data sources (regional, national and EU statistical entities and databases). What is more striking, as seen in Table 9.3, is that it was possible to ﬁnd alternative non-traditional sources of data that have already been explored and presented in scientiﬁc literature. These data covers basically all dimensions and respective components of a central concept for elaborating TIA analysis: territorial cohesion. Here, the economic-related indicators were basically the exception as regards the availability of relevant non-traditional data which can be used to assess territorial cohesion trends in a given territory. Also, it goes without saying that what this research found does not necessarily equate precisely to all potential non- traditional indicators which can eventually be found and applied in assessing each of the territorial cohesion analytic components. Moreover, many other non-traditional data sources can be found and used to analyse other topics which can be assessed 184 E. Medeiros via TIA methodologies, such as cross-border cooperation programmes, and urban, rural or regional development policies, among several other policy domains. The selection of the territorial cohesion concept (Medeiros, 2016b)serves as a concrete and optimal example to explain the potential selection of sources of non- traditional data towards an analysis of EU territorial heterogeneity. Firstly, territorial cohesion is a multi-dimensional concept which encompasses a wide array of policy arenas, which can, in its own right, be also subject to a stand-alone TIA analysis, as is the case of environmental sustainability-related policies. Secondly, territorial cohesion can be analysed at different territorial levels, and some of them, especially at the urban and local levels, can greatly beneﬁt from the new spatial granularity provided by some of the already available non-traditional sources of data. In detail, Table 9.3 provides at least one example of a potential indicator and respective data source which can be used to assess most of the identiﬁed territorial cohesion components. This is particularly valid for analysing social cohesion, environmental sustainability, territorial governance and cooperation and trends in morphological polycentricity. A large part of these novel and non-traditional data, which can be used as complementary to existing traditional data, is linked to mobile technologies (i.e. phones). Due to the large amount of presented examples, a more detailed explanation of each one of these sources of alternative data can be found on the presented literature references. One can, however, highlight the tremendous possibilities provided by mobile technologies to study commuter ﬂows using public transport in a given territory, which can deliver a very precise location at different times of the day, and even real-time information. Another example is the collection of data from certain operators on the production and use of renewable sources of energy at any given time, in different locations. This data can be particularly useful since traditional sources of statistics do not yet provide detailed information, per territorial sub-national unit, on the production and use of renewable energy. Most instructive in the polycentricity analytic domain of territorial cohesion is the possibility to use geospatial data sources to assess the degree of urban compactness, which is otherwise difﬁcult to analyse by means of traditional sources of data. Finally, it is interesting to see the number of digital sources of information which can be used to analyse and measure governance and cooperation-related analytic components such as social participation and interaction. How far and how this data is spatially detailed and how it can be updated is, however, a discussion topic for subsequent analysis. 9.3.3 Main Challenges on Using Non-traditional Sources of Data on Implementing TIA Methodologies The previous topic unveiled a wealth of non-traditional sources of information to implement TIA methodologies, mostly based on the use of territorial cohesion as a central concept for the TIA analysis, as would be the case in assessing the 9 Data and Modelling for the Territorial Impact Assessment (TIA) of Policies 185Table9.3Non-traditionaldataforanalysingterritorialcohesionDimensionComponentTraditionalindicatorsPotentialnon-traditionalindicatorDataandsourceSocioeconomiccohesionProductivityWorkproductivity––IncomeGDPpercapita––EmploymentEmploymentrate––InnovationPatentsgrantedPatentsinITC-relatedtechnologyclassesEUESSLaitprojectMicroMomentsDatabase(OECD,2014)InfrastructureIndustrialparks––EntrepreneurshipStartupsNumberofStartupsperuniversityUniversityinternetsitesEducationTertiaryeducation(%)MobilephonesforeducationalassessmentMobilephonedata(¸Sahin&Mentor,2016)HealthPhysicianspercapitaMobilephonedataforinformingpublichealthactionsMobilephonedata(Oliveretal.,2020)CultureCultureexpenses(%)Digitaldimensionofculturalcapitale.g.ReadingIRTscore(Paino&Renzulli,2013)Exclusion/inclusionPovertyrateDigitalpovertye.g.digitalinteraction(Barrantes,2007)BasicinfrastructurePublictransportsDigitaldataforpublictransportMobilephonedataandSmartcarddata(Zannat&Choudhury,2019)(continued) 186 E.

Medeiros territorial impacts of EU Cohesion Policy in a given territory. In almost every way, however, the use of these ‘novel and digital’ sources of data comes with known challenges, mainly related to the goal of establishing the necessary correct level of spatial granularity provided by spatial analysis, as is the case of a TIA. Alike and complementary challenges can be exposed when trying to ﬁnd and use such sources of data. 9.3.3.1 The Relevance of the Sample Collected data for TIA studies must be sound, reliable, comparable and georefer- enced. As such, it is crucial that non-traditional data selected for TIA methodologies represent a relevant number (or sample) of the population (individuals, entities) on several territorial levels (from local to national if possible). Furthermore, existing data should be regularly updated, at least each year. For that, individuals and entities which are asked to provide their positions via mobile or non-mobile technological platforms should be convinced of the common beneﬁts to change policies from transmitting the requested information on a regular basis. 9.3.3.2 Precise Location and Low Cost of Collected Data Entities which use digital technological means to gather data should provide the produced data at distinct spatial granularities preferably via a free or low-cost online framework. This is, of course, challenging, particularly in establishing the correct level of spatial granularity and optimality of the targeted policy measure and costs/timeliness of the decision. These challenges depend on what policy is being assessed via a TIA methodology. In the case of assessing EU cross-border cooperation programmes, for instance, the level of spatial granularity would require the use of EU NUTS 3-related data. In this case, the cost and time associated with the acquisition of non-traditional data on cross-border commuting for each border NUTS 3, for instance, could be ﬁnancially and timely viable in view of the analytic added value it would provide to the overall TIA analysis, based on our experience (Medeiros, 2017a). Indeed, one of the potential advantages of using data collected via the activation of the GPS location of mobile devices, or via digital questionnaires requesting the exact location of the individual, is the possibility to produce precise spatial analysis, which is vital for analysing certain territorial processes, such as metropolitan and cross-border commuting patterns. 9.3.3.3 Easy Access and Real-Time Data One of the tantalising challenges associated with accessing non-traditional data sources is its dispersion by a myriad of different sources. In this regard, already existing statistical entities such as Eurostat and national statistic entities could 9 Data and Modelling for the Territorial Impact Assessment (TIA) of Policies 189 centralise non-traditional data sources in their existing online platforms for data consulting. This would facilitate the access to data to all interested. Another possi- bility is to have an internet platform with links available to non-traditional sources of data divided by policy domains. Some of these sources are already provided on internet sites and a few demonstrate quite interesting real-time spatialised data (e.g. Flightradar24). To have a platform with the collection of all available real- time spatialised data sites would signiﬁcantly reduce the time and, inevitably, costs associated with the search for non-traditional data to elaborate a TIA. 9.4 The Way Forward In the context of policy evaluation, TIAs are relatively new. A cursory glance across existing TIAs also conﬁrms their continuous modiﬁcation and perfection process towards improved effectiveness in assessing the main ex ante (mostly) and ex post territorial impacts of projects, programmes and policies. In this evolving methodological context, the scientiﬁc relevance of using non-traditional data is par- ticularly important for TIA, for several reasons. Firstly, by covering all dimensions of territorial development, TIAs require a wide set of comparable territorialised data which are often difﬁcult to get via traditional data sources (regional, national and European statistic entities). In this regard, it is routinely contended that some dimensions and respective components of territorial development, such as territorial governance and spatial planning, have limited comparable and spatialised data, which can complement abundant data from socioeconomic development-related components. Secondly, non-traditional sets of data do not embrace real-time and spatial accuracy qualities, which can be of great value when assessing territorial impacts of certain policy areas, such as cross-border cooperation processes. When contemplating the potential advantages of using non-traditional data in TIAs, which include their complementarity with traditional sources of data and the possibility of using real-time information and more detailed spatial accuracy, it is easy to demonstrate the potential advantages for existing TIA methods to not only provide more comprehensive and coherent TIA impact policy scores but to also improve overall policy forecast accuracy, both at ex ante and ex post evaluation phases. There are several open avenues for research on how to conciliate the use of traditional and non-traditional data to be used in TIA methodologies, which is still very much absent in current TIA related literature. There is a wealth of academic literature on the potential use of non-traditional data in many aspects of territorial development. Amid this ever-growing body of literature discussing the potential use of non- traditional data for policy evaluation in speciﬁc policy areas, this chapter compiled, for the ﬁrst time, a collection of potential non-traditional indicators, proposed in academic literature, which can be used in all existing TIA methodologies. There are, for sure, far more such indicators of this kind which can complement and complete the use of traditional datasets to be used in TIA analysis. What is 190 E. Medeiros striking are the tremendous possibilities to obtain non-traditional indicators for analysing the dimensions and components of territorial development as normally there are fewer options available with traditional data. It was indeed, a great surprise that it was possible to ﬁnd a myriad of potential non-traditional indicators in components related to the analysis of, for instance, territorial governance, which imply wider possibilities to better understand social participation and involvement related processes. The same goes for increasing possibilities to better understand spatial planning trends via the analysis of speciﬁc components such as commuting ﬂows, detailed analysis of demographic density and urban compactness. Likewise, the analysis of environmental sustainability trends on related components can be greatly improved using novel non-traditional data in areas such as renewable energy, environmental quality and sustainability. But even domains which are normally relatively robust in terms of data availability, such as the economic and social indicators, can be complemented by existing non-traditional sources of data in certain domains such as innovation, entrepreneurship, education, health, culture and security. I have to admit that, prior to writing this chapter, I was not fully aware of the sea of possibilities offered by the potential use of non-traditional data indicators which can be used by TIA methodologies. Hence, what this chapter offers to the interested readers is a necessarily short and simpliﬁed introduction to the potential advantages of using non-traditional data when implementing TIA methodologies, as well as a wide number of potential non-traditional indicators and respective literature. Future analysis can detail even more the availability of such types of data to be used in assessing the territorial impacts of policies. Given the speed in which science evolves nowadays, I would not be surprised if 10 years from now, the number of non-traditional indicators that could potentially be used for TIA analysis has grown exponentially. But more importantly, in our opinion, existing and future sources of non-traditional data should be compiled on a regular basis and formatted in a sound, reliable, comparable and georeferenced manner, to be used in TIAs. By implication, these novel data should be easily accessible in online platforms and preferably free of charge, so they can be easily collected and used by all interested. In this regard, the EC can play a vital role in deﬁning norms and regulations similar to the ones used for traditional data and use entities such as Eurostat and the JRC, as platforms to make it available to the general public in an organised manner, not only in datasets but also via Web Geographical Information Systems presenting real-time information. To some extent, data science and technology are at the heart of an ongoing scientiﬁc and technological revolution and globalisation transformation. Even more starkly, the past decades saw a drastic change in data availability for policy evalua- tion. Indeed, around 30 years ago, the implementation of a TIA would be almost impossible since comparable spatialised data only existed for certain social and economic indicators. This means that it was only possible to assess socioeconomic impacts of a given policy. Instead, territorial impact analysis implies a balanced collection of not only socioeconomic but also environmental, governance and spatial planning related indicators. This context explains why TIA analyses are relatively 9 Data and Modelling for the Territorial Impact Assessment (TIA) of Policies 191 recent. They gravely depend on data availability in several policy domains. For all involved in territorial analysis and speciﬁcally in implementing TIA methodologies, data availability is still a major challenge. This is particularly evident for ex post TIA analysis which require a crucial use of comparable quantitative data to verify territorial trends of the analysed territory using a wide set of indicators. By proposing at least one potential non-traditional data indicator for almost all the components of territorial cohesion, to be used on TIA analysis, this chapter underlines a rosier foresight for TIA evaluations, no matter which methodology and selected time framework (ex ante, mid-term or ex post). This crucial positive implication of using non-traditional sources of data to implement TIAs in a more effective manner remains, however, to be seen in a practical manner, since there are still several challenges ahead to make them usable in scientiﬁc research, as previously mentioned. These challenges are also rooted in pre-conceptions related to the potential unreliability and incomparability of certain non-traditional data sources. Even so, the potential gains from using them for territorial analysis are evident. The idea, for instance, of using data from mobile phones and related mobile sources, to analyse metropolitan and cross-border commuting patterns is widely appealing for policy makers and evaluators. Similarly, data obtained from satellites can provide a very detailed spatial granularity, often absent from traditional sources of data. Hence, the use of programmes or software to automate the analysis of territorial impacts (programmatic scope), with a complementary use of non- traditional sources, heralds a battery of choices which are widely promising, but that are yet to be fully understood and tested. This is an appealing testing ground for future research for all involved in TIA implementation. References Akhmetov, B., & Aitimov, M. (2015).

Chapter 10 Challenges and Opportunities of Computational Social Science for Ofﬁcial Statistics Serena Signorelli, Matteo Fontana, Lorenzo Gabrielli, and Michele Vespe Abstract The vast amount of data produced everyday (so-called digital traces) and available nowadays represent a gold mine for the social sciences, especially in a computational context, that allows to fully extract their informational and knowledge value. In the latest years, statistical ofﬁces have made efforts to proﬁt from harnessing the potential offered by these new sources of data, with promising results. But how difﬁcult is this integration process? What are the challenges that statistical ofﬁces would likely face to proﬁt from new data sources and analytical methods? This chapter will start by setting the scene of the current ofﬁcial statistics system, with a focus on its fundamental principles and dimensions relevant to the use of non-traditional data. It will then present some experiments and proofs of concept in the context of data innovation for ofﬁcial statistics, followed by a discussion on prospective challenges related to sustainable data access, new technical and methodological approaches and effective use of new sources of data. 10.1 Introduction Ofﬁcial statistics can be deﬁned as the ensemble of all indicators, statistics and indices that are produced and disseminated by national statistical authorities (OECD The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an ofﬁcial position of the European Commission.

Right now, in their operations, ofﬁcial statistics tend to rely on so-called traditional data sources, namely, census data, surveys and administrative data.1 Yet, in an era characterised by increasing amounts of time spent living with connected devices, large amounts of new data are generated and collected every day. The places that we live in or that we visit can be inferred by analysing the position marked by our smartphones, our passions and relationship networks inferred from what we write on social media, and our health status from physiological data gathered through smart watches. By living in a world that is a hybrid between its real and virtual instances, every day we leave traces and footprints of our life that are digital and can thus be collected, stored and processed. Is it possible for statistical ofﬁces to draw on these “digital trace” data for creating new statistical indicators or for improving speed, quality and resolution of old ones in the ﬁeld of social sciences? Such questions are very timely and high policy relevance, as shown by the collective exercise carried out at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (Bertoni et al., 2022) with the aim of mapping the demand side of Computational Social Science for Policy and its speciﬁc chapter on data innovation for ofﬁcial statistics. In this chapter, we will address main challenges and needs that statistical authorities will have to face in order to harness the full potential of these new data sources and illustrate some successful examples, with a focus on Computational Social Science. 10.2 Current Ofﬁcial Statistics Systems In a recent report (2019, Chap. 7), the United Nations deﬁne three different types of data sources that are or could be used in ofﬁcial statistics: 1. Statistical data sources, composed by data collections created primarily for statistical purposes. This category includes surveys and census data. 2. Administrative data sources, which, differently from the former sources, are primarily set up for administrative purposes by public sector bodies. 3. Other data sources represented by all other sources created for commercial, market research or other private purposes. The third source of data is the one that usually is referred to as the term “big data”. In the following section, we introduce the ofﬁcial statistics principles and how these new data sources relate to them. The section provides an overview of the steps that statistical agencies have undertaken so far to discover their potential and leverage their value and represent the foundations for Computational Social Science to provide input to policy through Ofﬁcial Statistics. 1 Examples include birth and death registers in demographic statistics or the registries of real estate transactions in housing market statistics. 10 Challenges and Opportunities of Computational Social Science for Ofﬁcial... 197 10.2.1 Statistical Principles To fulﬁl their mission of providing timely and reliable data, the National Statistical Systems must comply with a set of principles that were formalised and adopted for the ﬁrst time in 1991 by the Conference of European Statisticians (1991), revised afterwards and adopted globally by the UN Statistical Commission (1994),2 with the name of Fundamental Principles of Ofﬁcial Statistics. Subsequently these principles have been updated periodically: the most recent version dates to 2013 (UN Economic and Social Council, 2013). Together with the principles above, the concept of “quality” of ofﬁcial statistics needs to be taken into account. Brackstone (1999) deﬁned quality in statistical agencies as “embracing those aspects of the statistical outputs of a NSO [National Statistical Ofﬁce] that reﬂect their ﬁtness for use by clients” and, as this concept is not capable of giving an operational deﬁnition, deﬁned six dimensions of the broader concept to quality (see Table 10.1). These six dimensions have been adapted by the main International Statistical Organizations to their own needs, as detailed in the table published by UNECE (Vale, 2010)(see Table 10.2). When dealing with new data sources, one of the key elements to be considered is timeliness. Surveys and censuses usually require a substantial timeframe between the collection phase and the publication of results, while different sources like, for example, mobile phone data, could be available, at least theoretically, in near-real time. Together with timeliness, this highlights an additional feature offered by new data sources that is the potential to improve frequency or periodicity of the data collected. The time between observation can be reduced almost arbitrarily below the yearly or monthly that are typical in current ofﬁcial statistics. As Brackstone (1999) points out in Table 10.1, “Timeliness is typically involved in a trade-off against accuracy”. In fact, this is speciﬁcally true for traditional data sources such as survey or census data. With reference to new sources of data, they usually do not constitute a representative sample of the population marking an intrinsic limitation to accuracy. In the case of new data sources, accuracy is less linked to timeliness given the availability of information that occurs in almost real time. When dealing with innovative data sources, other kind of trade-offs may emerge; as an example, when dealing with mobility data gathered via mobile networks (as done in Iacus et al. (2020)), accuracy could be in trade-off with resolution, since the increase in granularity may further reduce the representativeness of the information. This representation issue constitutes one of the differences between data coming from research institutions and from commercial companies highlighted by Liu et al. (2016). Private companies do not necessarily follow scientiﬁc data collections procedures or statistical sampling schemes, as their main objective is to streamline 2 The United Nations Statistical Commission represents he highest body of the global statistical system and brings together the Chief Statisticians from member states from around the world. 198 S. Signorelli et al. Table 10.1 The six dimensions of data quality, from Brackstone (1999) Relevance “The relevance of statistical information reﬂects the degree to which it meets the real needs of clients. It is concerned with whether the available information sheds light on the issues of most importance to users”. Assessing relevance is a subjective matter dependent upon the varying needs of users. The NSO’s challenge is to weigh and balance the conﬂicting needs of different users to produce a program that goes as far as possible in satisfying the most important needs and users within given resource constraints”. Accuracy “The accuracy of statistical information is the degree to which the information correctly describes the phenomena it was designed to measure. It is usually characterized in terms of error in statistical estimates and is traditionally decomposed into bias (systematic error) and variance (random error) components. It may also be described in terms of the major sources of error that potentially cause inaccuracy (e.g., coverage, sampling, nonresponse, response)”. Timeliness “The timeliness of statistical information refers to the delay between the reference point (or the end of the reference period) to which the information pertains, and the date on which the information becomes available. It is typically involved in a trade-off against accuracy. The timeliness of information will inﬂuence its relevance”. Accessibility “The accessibility of statistical information refers to the ease with which it can be obtained from the NSO. This includes the ease with which the existence of information can be ascertained, as well as the suitability of the form or medium through which the information can be accessed. The cost of the information may also be an aspect of accessibility for some users”. Interpretability “The interpretability of statistical information reﬂects the availability of the supplementary information and metadata necessary to interpret and utilize it appropriately. This information normally covers the underlying concepts, variables and classiﬁcations used, the methodology of collection, and indications of the accuracy of the statistical information”. Coherence “The coherence of statistical information reﬂects the degree to which it can be successfully brought together with other statistical information within a broad analytic framework and over time. The use of standard concepts, classiﬁcations and target populations promotes coherence, as does the use of common methodology across surveys. Coherence does not necessarily imply full numerical consistency”. processes such as billing (e.g., call detail records—CDR—from mobile network operators) or optimise services as product recommendations and advertising (e.g., social media advertising platform data), ultimately maximising their proﬁt. Another accuracy aspect that Liu et al. (2016) highlight is the fact that private companies could “change the sampling methods and processing algorithms at any time and without any notice”, adding uncertainty and risk to accuracy. Examples of this were reported when accessing mobility data from multiple mobile network operators in Europe to help ﬁght COVID-19 (Vespe et al., 2021). Finally, Liu et al. (2016) emphasise how the validity of data itself could be at risk, as “commercial platforms have no obligation or motivation to ensure the authenticity and validity of the data they collected”. 10 Challenges and Opportunities of Computational Social Science for Ofﬁcial... 199 Table 10.2 Mapping quality components used by International Statistical Organisations, from Vale (2010) UNECE OECD EUROSTAT IMF Relevance Relevance Relevance Prerequisites of quality (part) Methodological soundness Accuracy Accuracy Accuracy Accuracy and reliability Timeliness Timeliness Timeliness and punctuality Serviceability (part) Punctuality Accessibility Accessibility Accessibility and clarity Accessibility Clarity Interpretability Assurances of integrity (part) Comparability Coherence Comparability Serviceability (part) Coherence (Considered more relevant at the level of the organisation) Credibility Prerequisites of quality (part) Assurances of integrity (part) The dimensions described above are not the only ones affected by the uptake of innovative data sources in ofﬁcial statistics; we need to consider accessibility issues, as new data sources—often privately held—may be difﬁcult or expensive to procure. At the same time, it is also true that the data sources currently used in ofﬁcial statistics (surveys, generally) already present an increase in nonresponse rates, that leads to a reduction in the quality of data and consequently to an increase in the associated costs (Luiten et al., 2020). In order to improve accessibility, a switch to new data sources could be framed as a possible way to address rising costs associated with traditional data collections. Costs would probably not be reduced, but ﬁnancial resources could be invested into new sources that could complement (or even replace) existing ones. Nevertheless, in many other cases, data may not be yet available on the market for several reasons (e.g., non-clear reputational or monetisation advantages over risks of non-compliance after sharing the data), requiring additional efforts to improve such data ﬂows, including regulatory ones (e.g., the EU Data Governance Act3 or the EU Data Act4). As mentioned, the use of such new data sources for ofﬁcial statistics would be a secondary one with respect to the reasons for which they were conceived and collected. For example, CDR data could be employed for mobility analysis (Blondel et al., 2015), while social media advertising platform data could be used to estimate population ﬂows (Spyratos et al., 2019). This requires a certain amount of additional processing and interpretation in order to lead to meaningful indicators. 3 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0767 4 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/data-act-proposal-regulation-harmonised-rules- fair-access-and-use-data 200 S. Signorelli et al. Interpretability5 will therefore play a signiﬁcant role in the future of ofﬁcial statistics with new data, as it will not be straightforward as currently is with surveys and census data, designed and set up to describe the phenomenon they are supposed to measure. Also, coherence will be affected, as it will be important for these data sources to be sustainable over time, making them available continuously and with constant underlying methodology (this links again to accuracy), or at least with full knowl- edge of it to be constantly updated as part of the production process. Going back to the Fundamental Principles of Ofﬁcial Statistics (UN Economic and Social Council, 2013), which deal with issues like accountability, relevance, impartiality and transparency, among others, it can be observed that a process of adaptation of these guidelines to a new paradigm will be needed. For example, principle no. 2 states that “to retain trust in ofﬁcial statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientiﬁc principles and professional ethics, on the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and presentation of statistical data”. This principle refers to transparency in ofﬁcial statistics, which is assessed and guaranteed by a set of guidelines that must be fulﬁlled by professionals handling data in statistical ofﬁces. Nevertheless, the concept of transparency applied to new sources and digital trace data should not only be seen from a “data handler” perspective, but it must be complemented by a set of rules that refer to procedures and codes used to produce insights, calling for open-source practices and FAIR (ﬁndable, accessible, interpretable and reusable) data principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016) to ensure interpretability and reproducibility. The structure of the statistical system may need to adapt when using digital trace data: the “survey design” part would become less relevant in this context, possibly superseded by a “data ingestion” and “data processing” sections, while processing becomes central. The nature and composition of the tasks a NSO needs to perform to deliver reliable ofﬁcial statistics starting from big data may call for an adaptation of the organisational structure as well as of the competences needed by NSOs. Many statistical ofﬁces have begun this transformation with exploratory exercises with the exception of sporadic cases.6 This is a challenge that statistical ofﬁces may need to face. As an example, in terms of computer code, with a one-off analysis (as done with scientiﬁc research), it is sufﬁcient to publish the code as open source, while in regular production settings of ofﬁcial statistics, the code itself needs to be maintained, implementing regular edits and versioning. This translation of statistical 5 Interpretability here has to be intended in the broader sense used by Brackstone (1999) and not as in the machine learning context [see, e.g., Murdoch et al. (2019)], where it is more related to algorithmic transparency. 6 International travel statistics in Estonia: https://statistika.eestipank.ee/failid/mbo/valisreisid_eng. html and foreign visitor statistics in Indonesia: https://www.bps.go.id/subject/16/pariwisata.html# subjekViewTab1, both using mobile positioning data. 10 Challenges and Opportunities of Computational Social Science for Ofﬁcial... 201 methodology into software code has been introduced by Ricciato (2022) with the name of softwarisation of statistical methodologies. 10.2.2 Recognition of the Value of New Data Sources In Europe, the European Statistical System7 (ESS) has been involved in recognising the existence of digital trace data and its value since nearly a decade. Two documents have paved the way to the use of innovative data sources in ofﬁcial statistics. The Scheveningen Memorandum on Big Data and Ofﬁcial Statistics (DGINS, 2013) represents the ﬁrst statement through which the ESS recognised the importance of these new data sources and highlighted the main issues related to their use. The Bucharest Memorandum on Ofﬁcial Statistics in a Dataﬁed Society (Trusted Smart Statistics) (DGINS, 2018) represents an updated version of the former docu- ment, where the ESS underlines the need for “amendments to the statistical business architecture, processes, production models, IT infrastructures, methodological and quality frameworks, and the corresponding governance structures”. Moreover, in 2021 Eurostat8 started a revision process of Regulation 223/20099 (the EU legal framework for European statistics) considering the new needs of ofﬁcial statistics. The updated version of the Regulation is expected to be ﬁnalised by the end of 2022. One of the explicit goals of the revision process is to set the legal framework for the reuse of privately held data for the development, production and dissemination of ofﬁcial statistics in Europe (Baldacci et al., 2021). On a more international perspective, the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) collected a series of examples of statistical applications (OECD, 2015) that made use of new data sources, as well as a list of limitations of this type of data. More importantly, the report introduces the implications for statistical ofﬁces when using these new data sources. Speciﬁcally, they envision three different possible roles for statistical ofﬁces, which may: 1. Act as certiﬁcatory institutions (giving the so-called trust mark to datasets) 2. Act as dissemination institutions (in a way that all statistics produced with non- traditional data are stored and disseminated in a central agency—the National Statistical Ofﬁce) 3. Become active users of non-traditional data sources, for complementing the traditional ones as well as to create standalone statistical series 7 The partnership between the European Community statistical authority, composed by Eurostat, the national statistical ofﬁces (NSOs) and other national authorities in each EU Member State that are responsible for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics. 8 The statistical ofﬁce of the European Union. 9 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32009R0223 202 S. Signorelli et al. The OECD has already underlined some sensitive issues that will need to be taken into consideration for a successful adoption of non-traditional data in the workﬂow of national statistical ofﬁces. The main challenges are represented by the acquisition of skills needed to work with non-traditional data, the relevant data governance principles as well as privacy concerns (OECD, 2015). They also see space for partnerships of National Statistical Ofﬁces with universities and research organisations to best exploit the new opportunities brought by data innovation and to become collectors and disseminators of best practices. 10.2.3 Some Proof of Concepts and Experiences In 2014, the United Nations established a Global Working Group (GWG) on Big Data for Ofﬁcial Statistics10 with the aim of promoting the practical use of big data sources as well as building trust in the use of these sources for ofﬁcial statistics. One of the outputs of the group was a handbook on the use of mobile phone data for ofﬁcial statistics (UN Global Working Group on Big Data for Ofﬁcial Statistics, 2019), which put forward a series of practical examples of the use of this data source in different statistical domains (tourism, population, migration, commuting, trafﬁc ﬂow and employment). Many countries (Estonia, Japan, Sri Lanka, among others) launched pilots and projects that have some potential for statistics in the mentioned statistical domains. Most practical examples of applications have been carried out by European coun- tries, where a partnership between Eurostat, NSOs and other National authorities that are responsible for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics was implemented with the name of European Statistical System (ESS). One of the ﬁrst attempts identiﬁed is ESSnet Big Data I,11 composed by 22 NSOs. The objective of this initiative is to integrate big data into the regular production of ofﬁcial statistics. This is achieved via the development of projects that could explore the potential of these data sources, carried out from February 2016 to May 2018. One of these projects was carried out with the help of six national statistical institutes (and afterwards other four joined) and investigated the feasibility of using job advertisement data scraped from the Web to improve ofﬁcial estimates of job vacancy statistics.12 The activity consisted in the comparison between online job advertisement and job vacancy surveys. Some cases demonstrated a high correlation, while others showed only a loose relationship between the two. Nevertheless, this appears to be a promising area where innovative data can complement traditional survey data by potentially producing ﬂash estimates or 10 https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/ 11 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/essnet-big-data-1_en 12 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/wp1-reports-milestones-and-deliverables1_en 10 Challenges and Opportunities of Computational Social Science for Ofﬁcial... 203 increasing the frequency survey-based statistics but also to produce additional insights about occupations, required skills and labour demand in local areas. Another ESSnet example aimed at inferring enterprise characteristics by access- ing their websites through Web scraping techniques.13 Six NSOs were involved, and their activity focused on six different use cases (URLs retrieval, e-commerce/web sales, social media detection, job advertisement detection, NACE14 detection, SDGs detection) using both deterministic and machine learning methods. The predicted values can be used at unit level, to enrich the information contained in the register of the population of interest, and at population level, to produce estimates. The activity resulted in a series of output indicators, published as experimental statistics).15 A third example in the framework of the ESS network (European Statistical System, 2017) concerned the use of scanner data or web-scraping for Consumer Price Index (made by NSOs in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal), the use of mobile phone data to study population and the study of tourist accom- modations offered by individuals (French NSO), an analysis on the identiﬁcation of inhabited addresses through electricity providers data to reduce survey costs (NSOs in Poland and Estonia) and the use of credit and debit cards data in the National Accounts (Portuguese NSO). A deeper analysis was carried out speciﬁcally on tourism statistics. Eurostat has made an extended analysis of data sources having potential relevance for measuring tourism. In a recent report (2017), Demunter develops a taxonomy of big data sources relevant to tourism, including communication systems (e.g., MNO data, social media posts), web (e.g., web activity data), business process generated data (e.g., ﬂight bookings, ﬁnancial transactions), sensors (e.g., earth observation, vessel tracking systems, smart energy meters) and crowdsourcing (e.g., Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap). An attempt to develop a hybrid between one-off analyses and regular production statistics has been undertaken by some statistical ofﬁces in the form of experimental statistics. Among the examples that can be identiﬁed, a very notable one was carried out by Eurostat.16 These statistics cover 14 topics,17 ranging from collaborative economy platforms to skills mismatch. All these experiments are listed and can be further explored.18 They are deemed experimental as they “have not reached full maturity in terms of harmonisation, coverage or methodology”. Nevertheless, the potential in terms of provided insights and knowledge of such solutions is clearly disruptive. Moreover, in a spirit of experimentation and co-creation, Eurostat and the single NSOs invite users to submit feedback and suggestions to improve them. 13 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/wp2-reports-milestones-and-deliverables1_en 14 NACE stands for the statistical classiﬁcation of economic activities in the European Community. 15 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/experimental-statistics/ 16 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/experimental-statistics 17 At the moment of publishing. 18 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/experimental-statistics/overview/ess 204 S. Signorelli et al. The UK Ofﬁce for National Statistics published on its website a guide on experimental statistics,19 deﬁning the features of this kind of statistics, namely: • new methods, which are being tested and still subject to modiﬁcation; • partial coverage (for example, of industries) at that stage of the development programme; • potential modiﬁcation following user feedback about their usefulness and credibility compared with other available statistical sources. 10.3 The Need for Change The above considerations and examples show the signiﬁcant attention posed by statistical ofﬁces on the use of novel data sources since almost a decade, as well as the readiness and will to innovate. But what does this shift mean in practice for them? With the availability of new data sources, the statistical system may need to adapt, as it was traditionally designed to work with data of a different nature (surveys and administrative data). This comes from the fact that data from new sources (that we will call non-traditional data for convenience) are quite different from traditional ones: • Firstly, surveys are designed to produce speciﬁc statistics, whereas non- traditional data are collected for other purposes (see Section Current Ofﬁcial Statistics systems). • Secondly, while non-traditional data tend to capture human behaviour, they are not directly generated by humans, but by automated systems and machines with which humans interact. These peculiarities require an additional effort in terms of translating machine logs into information about human actions and then connecting such actions to human behaviour. • Thirdly, the process of translation of machine logs into information requires many choices to be done by researchers that will in some way inﬂuence the result (Ricciato, 2022; Ricciato et al., 2021). Having understood the context to properly address these issues, we can observe how the analysis and use of new data for ofﬁcial statistics requires a dual set of competences: both in terms of modelling and inference of human behaviour (in its many possible dimensions) as well as the technical capabilities needed to manage and analyse such big and complex data sources. This speciﬁc skillset is the one required by the emerging ﬁeld of Computational Social Science. Statistical authorities may need to develop and strengthen these skills to beneﬁt from the information included into non- traditional data. 19 https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/ guidetoexperimentalstatistics 10 Challenges and Opportunities of Computational Social Science for Ofﬁcial... 205 These new data sources represent a huge opportunity for statistical ofﬁces to innovate while increasing openness. Nonetheless, challenges relevant to data access, adaptation of processes and effective uses of the data will have to be addressed. 10.3.1 Data Access The great majority of the data sources that could be harnessed for ofﬁcial statistics purposes resides with the private sector. The debate on the access to such data is broad and vivid, with different opinions arising, in favour and against the mandatory obligation for private companies of giving access to the data. The European Commission is addressing this issue in its legislative process and has recently proposed a regulation in the framework of the European Data Strategy, the Data Act20 that, among other provisions, aims at fostering business- to-government data sharing for the public interest, supporting business-to-business data sharing and evaluating the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) framework with a view to further enhance data access and use. The legislative process started in May 2021 and included a public consultation carried out during summer of 2021 that led many affected parties to the publication of a number of position papers. From the perspective of statistical ofﬁces, the ESS called on the need for the Data Act to ensure that European Statistical Ofﬁces and Eurostat can be granted access to privately held data for the development, production and dissemination of ofﬁcial statistics (European Statistical System, 2021). On the other hand, private sector data holders stressed on a lack of incentives to share data and an unclear impact that this sharing would have in practice (Bitkom, 2021) but also on voluntary sharing of data (and not an obligation) (AmCham EU, 2021; ETNO, 2021; Orgalim, 2021) as well as legitimate business interest around data to be protected. The Data Act was proposed by the Commission on 23 February 2022 (European Commission, 2022), providing means for public sector bodies, EU institutions, agencies or bodies to access and use privately held data in exceptional circumstances such as in emergencies. Such data may be shared to carry out scientiﬁc research activities compatible with the purpose for which the data was requested by the public sector body or with national statistical institutes for the compilation of ofﬁcial statistics. Guidelines and best practices are also being published in the literature, such as by researchers from the Bank of Italy, highlighting the three main challenges that characterise the access and use of new data sources: trust, usability and sustainability (Biancotti et al., 2021). Moreover, the authors developed a set of principles that should guide data partnerships and that concern general aspects, principles speciﬁcally directed to statistical agencies and to private sectors’ data collectors (Biancotti et al., 2021). The principles directly related to statistical ofﬁces build 20 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/data-act-proposal-regulation-harmonised-rules- fair-access-and-use-data 206 S. Signorelli et al. around three main notions: responsibility and accountability (on process, output and methodology), safeguard (of individual and business interests), coordination and standardisation (the “collect only once” principle, to avoid the same request to thesamedataprovider). 10.3.2 Adapting the Ofﬁcial Statistics System In a recent paper (2020), Ricciato and co-authors highlight a set of important challenges that statistical ofﬁces may need to address when confronted with the possibility of using non-traditional data, which imply a series of changes “[ ... ] in almost every aspect of the statistical system: processing methodologies, computation paradigms, data access models, regulations, organizational aspects, communication and disseminations approaches, and so forth”. Going more into practical details and on speciﬁc issues, one of the most critical is privacy that must be protected via, e.g., privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Borrowing greatly from the work of Ricciato and co-authors (2019a), the UN Big Data Working Group deﬁned in 2019 the three goals that need to be taken as guidelines when dealing with privacy concerns: input privacy, output privacy and policy enforcement (Big Data UN Global Working Group, 2019). In particular, “one or more Input Parties provide sensitive data to one or more Computing Parties who statistically analyse it, producing results for one or more Result Parties” (Big Data UN Global Working Group, 2019). The ﬁrst goal, input privacy, must ensure that Computing parties are not able to access (or to indirectly derive with speciﬁc techniques and mechanism) any input value provided by Input Parties. At the other end of the process, output privacy has to ensure that published results do not contain identiﬁable input data. The third goal, introduced by the Big Data UN Global Working Group (2019), policy enforcement, represents the meeting point of the ﬁrst two, as it is able to assure that they are automatically assured in a privacy-preserving statistical analysis system. Without entering into many details, this goal is concretised if there exists a mechanism that allows input parties to exercise positive control over computations that can be performed on sensitive inputs and over the publication of results; the just mentioned positive control is “[ ... ] expressed in a formal language that identiﬁes participants and the rules by which they participate” and carried out through a series of rules and decision points. The report then presents ﬁve different PETs for statistics: Secure Multiparty Computation, (Fully) Homomorphic Encryption, Trusted Execution Environments, Differential Privacy and Zero Knowledge Proofs. In light of the abovementioned system, for each PET they describe which of the three goals it supports and in which way. Another important issue is the transparency of National Statistical Ofﬁces. Luhmann et al. (2019) propose a new paradigm called STATPRO (shared, trans- parent, auditable, trusted, participative, reproducible and open). The authors make an open call to all National Statistical Ofﬁces about the need of implementing these 10 Challenges and Opportunities of Computational Social Science for Ofﬁcial... 207 seven principles, in order to achieve the goal of having a transparent and defensible evidence-based data-informed policymaking. In particular, some best practices from the open-source software (OSS) community are needed for the development and deployment of statistical processes. As an example, they suggest that algorithms and methods should be available and accessible to anyone, with adequate level of documentation, and versioning should be introduced for environments. After looking at speciﬁc issues, we need to focus on how to practically adapt the production system with the new requirements brought by the use of non-traditional data. One possible approach is proposed by Grazzini et al. (2018) through the so- called plug and play design. This approach was thought to handle the changes needed in production systems, and it is based on software components, which are modular and customisable, that are subsequently assembled together. This design has the advantage of allowing the integration of existing systems, operations and components with the new ones needed to embrace new data and/or models. Being modular, it also allows to overcome the constraint usually present on the choice of platform used for the implementation. One practical proposal that has been theorised and discussed in Europe in recent years is the introduction of Trusted Smart Statistics. One of the main principles behind this proposal relies on the idea of “pushing computation out instead of pulling data in” (Ricciato et al., 2019b). The concept is often referred to as “in situ data processing” (Martens et al., 2021). This implies that the new data sources that statistical ofﬁces wish to analyse and integrate with traditional ones do not necessarily need to leave the premises of the data holders. Instead, the algorithm will reach the latter in order to perform computations, and afterwards only aggregated and processed data will be led to statistical ofﬁces to produce ofﬁcial statistics. On the one hand, this new paradigm will allow to preserve the privacy principle (as the data are not leaving their premises), but on the other hand, more attention must be paid to transparency and accountability. One way to address these issues is the way already paved by the OPen ALgorithm project (OPAL), which declared algorithmic transparency as its foundational principle.21 The proposal consists in making open by default all the software code along the whole data processing chain and allowing everybody to see it and, eventually, audit it (Ricciato et al., 2019b). 10.3.3 Effective Use of the New Sources Once the ﬁrst two issues are addressed (access to the data and changes in the statistical system), an important one (if not the most important) remains: what are the new statistical products that could only be developed using these new data sources? And why would be the responsibility of statistical ofﬁces to take care of this (and not, e.g., a local authority)? 21 http://www.opalproject.org/ 208 S. Signorelli et al. This implies that the focus must now go to the demand side and to the identiﬁcation of the questions that statistical ofﬁces could tackle with these data sources, in line with what proposed by Bertoni et al. (2022) in the Computational Social Science for policy mapping exercise. This represents a challenging task, as statistical ofﬁces need to take some time and reﬂect on what to highlight, but also why this relies in their mandate, and not among some other institution’s activity. Some examples of these new “needs” are clearly shown for instance in Romanillos Arroyo & Moya-Gómez (2023), Napierala & Kvetan (2023), Manzan (2023)and Crato (2023). Concerning tourism, for example, after an introduction about new data sources and new computational methods for the tourism sector, the authors propose a series of potential applications (in the form of KPIs) on environmental impact and socio-economic resilience of tourism. By looking at the KPIs proposed to monitor land use related to the tourism activities, for instance, one of the indicators put forward aims at quantifying the presence of short-term rentals platforms (like Airbnb) through the analysis of accommodation platform data or similar. This indicator would allow to get more insights about a phenomenon that is increasing and that is not captured through traditional data sources in the tourism sector (viz. surveys) (Romanillos Arroyo & Moya-Gómez, 2023).22 Another example concerns direct and indirect water consumption at tourism des- tinations, a KPI that could be useful for the management of resources consumption related to leisure places. In this case different datasets could be used: from smart meters to food consumption data that in turn can be inferred from credit card data (Romanillos Arroyo & Moya-Gómez, 2023). As can be seen, these new proposed indicators require prior agreement to accessing the data, and therefore the three issues we presented in this chapter again show their very close connectedness. 10.4 The Way Forward Summarising the issues highlighted in this chapter on the use of Computational Social Science for ofﬁcial statistics, the focus goes to the three main enablers: • The access to the data • The adaptation needed by ofﬁcial statistical system • New statistical products that could be developed using these new data sources Concerning this last point, a proposal to facilitate the implementation of this could be the institution of speciﬁc committees or steering groups with the aim to discuss possible solutions to the issues presented. Something that needs to be 22 The phenomenon of short-term rental accommodation in tourism is already under the lens of the European Commission, that will shortly propose a regulation about it (https://ec.europa.eu/ info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13108-Tourist-services-short-term-rental- initiative/public-consultation_en). 10 Challenges and Opportunities of Computational Social Science for Ofﬁcial... 209 underlined is the fact that even if data access could come for free (following speciﬁc partnerships or law provisions), the processing of these new data sources has a cost. As a concluding remark, these new data sources have enormous potential for the ofﬁcial statistics world in terms of improved timeliness and granularity, but they can only be considered as a complementary source and not pure substitutes of the traditional ones. As it is thoroughly explained in this chapter, due to the strict statistical requirements in terms of quality of the data used in ofﬁcial statistics we think that these new sources of data could improve and complement the existing ones.

Part III Applications Chapter 11 Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Security: Concept, Datasets and Opportunities for Computational Social Science Applications T. S. Amjath-Babu, Santiago Lopez Riadura, and Timothy J. Krupnik Abstract Ensuring food and nutritional security requires effective policy actions that consider the multitude of direct and indirect drivers. The limitations of data and tools to unravel complex impact pathways to nutritional outcomes have constrained efﬁcient policy actions in both developed and developing countries. Novel digital data sources and innovations in computational social science have resulted in new opportunities for understanding complex challenges and deriving policy outcomes. The current chapter discusses the major issues in the agriculture and nutrition data interface and provides a conceptual overview of analytical possibilities for deriving policy insights. The chapter also discusses emerging digital data sources, modelling approaches, machine learning and deep learning techniques that can potentially revolutionize the analysis and interpretation of nutritional outcomes in relation to food production, supply chains, food environment, individual behaviour and external drivers. An integrated data platform for digital diet data and nutritional information is required for realizing the presented possibilities. 11.1 Introduction The global goal of ending hunger and malnutrition (Sustainable Development Goal- 2) by 2030 is off track as the numbers of food insecure and malnourished people are increasing (Fanzo et al., 2020). The number of undernourished people climbed to 768 million in 2020 from 650 million in 2019 (FAO, 2021), belonging mainly to the Asian (>50%) and African continents (25%).

Some may consider it ironic that a large proportion of the undernourished people, who cannot afford healthy diets, are those involved in the food production, including subsistence farmers and farm labourers (Fanzo et al., 2022). In addition, low- and middle-income (LMIC) as well as wealthy countries are burdened with overweight (BMI > 25), obesity (BMI > 30) and diet-related non-communicable diseases (Ferretti & Mariani, 2017; Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition, 2016). As such, there are increasing calls for agricultural and food system innovations and policies that can enhance diets and improve availability of quality foods for better nutrition and health outcomes (Fanzo et al., 2022; Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition, 2016). Nevertheless, the linkages of global and national food systems to nutritional out- comes are complex and are inﬂuenced by diverse macro-level (trade, market access, climate change, technology, conﬂicts, wealth distribution, agricultural policies. etc.) and micro- and meso-level factors (farm types, income, gender considerations, diet preferences, attitude and beliefs, inter- and intra-household dynamics and power, cooking methods, sanitation, among others). A deeper understanding of these multi-scale (micro-, meso- and macro-level) drivers of nutritional outcomes is vital in devising agricultural policies and programmes and hence transforming the agri-food sector to meet the goal of ending hunger and malnutrition (Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition, 2016). There is a wide recognition of inadequate methods, data and metrics for understanding agri-food systems relationships to nutritional outcomes and dynamics (Marshall et al., 2021; Micha et al., 2018; Sparling et al., 2021). Towards this end, new sources of data and emerging computational social science methods may offer possibilities to test novel conceptual frameworks as well as empirical and experimental examination of the complex relationships and pathways. The current chapter focuses on how the availability of digital data and computational social science methods can support modelling and the analytics of a complex portfolio of factors (and their interactions) inﬂuencing food and nutritional outcomes. It also highlights the need of data- sharing protocols and platforms for fully utilizing the potential of emerging data and analytical tools for generating meaningful policy insights (Müller et al., 2020; Takeshima et al., 2020). 11.2 The Complex Pathways to Nutritional Outcomes: A Conceptual Note Agricultural production and consequently nutrient availability and consumption are interrelated through complex pathways span across spatial and time scales. Nutritional outcomes (Sparling et al., 2021) are driven by a range of factors including food production, consumer purchasing power, trade and market systems as 11 Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Security: Concept, Datasets... 217 well as food transformation and consumer behaviour (Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition, 2016). The downturns in economies, climate stress and conﬂicts can contribute to changes in consumption practices that lead to malnutrition, while trade policies and supply chain infrastructure can impact food prices that inﬂuence the costs of food necessary for healthy diets that in part drive nutritional outcomes (FAO, 2021). Climate variability and extreme events can lead to losses in agricultural production and increased import demand from affected countries, leading to food price volatility (Willenbockel, 2012; Chatzopoulos et al., 2020). Recession or reduction in economic activity at country level can also lead to unemployment and reduction in wages and income, which may force households to shift to energy dense and cheaper foods (including ‘junk food’) instead of purchasing and consuming nutritious foods (Dave & Kelly, 2012). Income and social inequality amplify the impact of climate stresses or economic downturns in terms of access to nutritious diets (FAO, 2021). Lower productivities and low efﬁciency of supply chains can also lead to higher prices for diverse food groups needed for healthy diets. Conﬂicts or health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic disrupt the movement of goods, increase in prices of healthy foods and decrease in their availability (Amjath-Babu et al., 2020). Conﬂicts can also reduce access to capital, energy, labour or land and hence impact food production (FAO, 2021). In the case of farm households, the raw nutrient availability for a household is determined by own production used for self-consumption, purchased food from market using the farm household income and food received through informal exchanges and social safety nets. Farm household income is determined by the yield (sold in market) of various farm enterprises (cereal crops, vegetables, cash crops, livestock, aquaculture, etc.), their farmgate price levels and the cost (inputs including land, labour, machinery, fertilizers, pest control, etc.) of production in addition to any available rental income, off-farm income and remittances. Farm production and income is further conditioned by environmental stresses and the state of natural resources (e.g. soil, water), agricultural policies and market infrastructure. Apart from these drivers, the technology available at farm level inﬂuences yield performance and post-harvest losses that impact food availability and access (Müller et al., 2020). The direct (self-consumption) and indirect (as a source of income for market purchase of food consumed) role of farm production in food nutrient availability depends on the strength and quality of market linkages (Bellon et al., 2020; Sibhatu et al., 2015). The net energy and macro- and micronutrient availability to men, women and children are further conditioned by diet preferences, cooking methods, gender norms, nutritional knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (Monterrosa et al., 2020). A deﬁcit in net availability and effective consumption of nutrients compared to requirement of individual members can potentially lead to malnutrition that can manifests in stunting, wasting of children, nutrition-deﬁcit disorders as well as nutrition-related non-communicable diseases (N-NCD) in children and adults. Stunting, wasting and N-NCD are conditioned not only by nutritional deﬁciencies but also by nutrient utilization (determining bioavailability of nutrients through metabolic pathways) capacity of human bodies (Millward, 2017) and sanitary, 218 T.S Amjath-Babu et al. hygiene and water quality conditions. Conversely overconsumption of high-calorie, low-nutrient foods can lead to overweight and obesity (Astrup & Bügel, 2019). Women’s empowerment in terms of time, income and asset control can also positively inﬂuence the nutritional and health-related outcomes (Herforth & Ballard, 2016). The agriculture-nutrition pathway map by Kadiyala et al. (2014) includes health-care expenditure, health status as well as women’s employment as additional determinants for nutritional outcomes. Figure 11.1 provides a comprehensive overview of the complex path of nutritional outcomes. In the case of affordability of diets, nutrient adequate (e.g. the advised ‘EAT- Lancet diet’) diets is not affordable for 1.5 billion poor people globally (Hirvonen et al., 2020). Even in European Union, around 10% of population in 16 countries faces ﬁnancial issues in affording healthy diets (Penne & Goedemé, 2021). Nutrient-rich food items are often costly to grow, store and transport compared to starchy food. Oil and sugar tend also to have a longer shelf life and is easier to transport (Fanzo et al., 2022). This calls for also further understanding on ways to make the nutritious food more affordable as high prices of nutritious food or its volatility can negatively impact consumption among the poor. Conversely, lower prices of sugar and sugar- rich food prices are related to higher prevalence of overweight and obesity (Headey &Alderman, 2019). These point to the importance of a better understanding of the macro-economic policies on nutritional outcomes as well as disconnects between agriculture-nutrition pathways. The discussion so far highlights the requirement of deeper understanding the complex pathways linking nutritional security, health outcomes and public policies, especially for the most vulnerable groups (children and women). Below, we discuss existing modelling-based approaches as well as the role of emerging digital data and computational methods in opening new frontiers in quantifying the ex ante impacts of regional or national food and nutrition policies by unravelling the complex interactions of the macro-meso-micro-factors. 11.3 Current Ex Ante Analytical Models for Nutritional Policy Insights In case of existing ex ante assessments (nutritional outcomes of agricultural policy), three studies are discussed here for documenting the current state of the art of methods employed. Lopez-Ridaura et al. (2018) took a nutrient-balancing approach where self-consumed farm products and the net annual farm income derived from all farm enterprises were converted to energy equivalents and compared with annual food energy requirement of households. Although the model focused on calories, the simpliﬁed relation allowed simulations of yield changes due to new technologies and their impact on potential household-level food availability ratios. The study provides a framework that could also be extended to macro and micronutrient availability and consumption (Bizimana & Richardson, 2019). 11 Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Security: Concept, Datasets... 219Fig.11.1Macro-leveldriversandhousehold-levelnutritionoutcomepathwaysoffarmhouseholds[expandedframeworkbasedonaninitialframeworkpresentedinLopez-Ridauraetal.(2018)] 220 T.S Amjath-Babu et al. FARMSIM model is able to simulate the impact of net cash income from all farm enterprises on consumption of nutrients such as protein, calories, fat, calcium, iron and vitamin A. To represent the complex interrelations of macro- and micro- factors affecting food production and nutritional outcomes, current modelling approaches addressing nutritional security questions often use local-level proxies of macro-determinants (e.g. yield functions) or through representations of key variables (e.g. food prices or farm sizes) (Müller et al., 2020). In the case of the FARMSIM model, market prices are simulated (using Monte Carlo approaches) using probability distributions obtained from historical data or expert opinion, while yield distributions are generated by crop yields generated by the APEX (Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender) simulation model using historical weather data and plant growth parameters. These are matched to different technologies considered in simulation. Consideration of stochastic prices and yields allows modelling risk behaviour using stochastic efﬁciency with respect to a function (SERF). FSSIM-Dev (European Commission. Joint Research Centre, 2020)is a farm- level model based on positive mathematical programming (PMP) which does not consider risk as the model is deterministic. FSSIM-Dev considers the non- separability of production and consumption decisions of farming households: It maximizes the utility from both the production and the consumption of food, and the decision to rely on home production or to go the market is governed by transaction costs. The model considers annual income beyond farm income by including subsidies, pensions, off farm income, remittances and other transfers as exogenous variables. Farm income is linked to the consumption by a linear expenditure function of uncompressible consumption below which consumption may not fall and supernumerary consumption, which is modelled as a ﬁxed proportion (marginal budget share) of net income. FSSIM-Dev model is capable to generate food and nutrition security indicators as carbohydrates, proteins and lipids from the simulated food consumption. The simulation of micronutrients is not yet attempted by the existing model. Figure 11.1 shows an extended conceptual modelling frame that can offer wider insights to the questions related to nutritional impacts of agricultural policies, food environment, sanitation, etc. The quoted policy simulation studies analysed policy impact on availability of macronutrients such as carbohydrates or proteins and had limited capacity in dealing with micronutrients. In addition, modelling efforts currently have limited ability to consider the access (income levels, impact of social safety nets, informal exchanges of food) and stability (seasonality and occasional shocks), gender roles (intra- household food allocation, women empowerment) and utilization (bioavailability) dimensions of the nutrient security question. Net nutritional availability is also affected by cooking methods, knowledge, attitude and beliefs that are not always integrated in modelling exercises to reduce complexity. In case of availability of nutrients for a given individual, distribution of food within households adds another layer of complexity. Despite the fact that ensuring adequate nutrition at an individual’s level is at the heart of nutritional challenges, policy insights at this level are generally lacking. New sources of digital data and computational methods are expected to address the stated challenges. 11 Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Security: Concept, Datasets... 221 11.4 The Data Scarcity for Nutritional Modelling and Analytics The scarcity, within countries and among countries for harmonized data on food consumption and nutrition, is a major challenge for initiatives aimed at addressing global nutritional challenges. Currently, major data sources used for analytics are the specialized household surveys [demographic health surveys (DHS), multi-indicator cluster surveys (MICS), dietary intake surveys, consumption expenditure surveys, Living Standard Measurement Studies (LSMS), Food Security Monitoring System (FSMS) etc.]. These tend to include both economic-related variables and detailed diet data (Buckland et al., 2020). There is a need for efforts to make the datasets (cleaned data on food consumption and their nutritional equivalents) open through platforms with deﬁned standards and efﬁcient infrastructure to share data (de Beer, 2016). To make the open data sharing a reality, technological, legal and ethical challenges need to be considered. Communities like smallholder farmers hold data that, when subject to analytics, can be used to improve their well-being. But there is an absence of platforms and mechanisms that enable rapid and regular data acquisition and sharing (de Beer, 2016). Traka et al. (2020) suggested making food and nutrition data FAIR (ﬁndable, accessible, interoperable and reusable). An integrated data perspective of agriculture-food, nutrition and health is required for meaningful interventions ensuring sustainable production, shift in diets and reduction in non-communicable nutrition-related diseases (Traka et al., 2020). Even if data are available, they are often not available at sub-national levels, or may not be disaggregated across demographic groups, or may be out of date, in addition to a range of additional data quality challenges. Key complementary information required in preparing such databases is country-speciﬁc food composition tables (FCTs) that can be used to convert food products to their nutrient value, although often these tables are not comprehensive or may not even be available. As such, here is a need of coordinated effort to make sure that comprehensive FCTs are available (Ene-Obong et al., 2019). The distribution of food within households adds another layer of difﬁculty, since information regarding intra-household distribution is lacking in many surveys. The disaggregation of household consumption data using adult male equivalent (AME) weights is a relevant disaggregation method (Coates et al., 2017)and is based on household members’ relative caloric requirement. This deterministic method can be improved by adding error observed in dietary energy expenditure prediction models. Côté et al. (2022) compared traditional regression models against machine learning models in predicting individual vegetable and fruit consumption and did not observe a major improvement. Nevertheless, the scope of using machine learning or other innovative methods in disaggregation of consumption data is currently underexplored. Lager sets of food consumption data, disaggregated among household members, are required for validating and ﬁne-tuning the methods. 222 T.S Amjath-Babu et al. 11.5 Novel Digital Food and Nutrition Data for Computational Analytics Global Individual Food consumption data Tool (GIFT-FAO/WHO) initiative aims to make harmonized data freely accessible online through an interactive web platform. This tool is based on FoodEx2, which is a food classiﬁcation and description protocol (food items are coded with distinct hierarchy) developed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to standardize the 24 h recall data (Leclercq et al., 2019). There are also increasing attempts to collect nutritional data using telephonic surveys. Lamanna et al. (2019) reports that efforts to collect nutrition data from rural women in Kenya through telephone surveys result in a 0–25% increase in nutritional scores [minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W) and minimum acceptable diet for Infants and young children (MAD) estimates compared to face- to-face interviews]. This points to the potential of using digital tools and methods for data collection. Nutrition apps for collecting diet information are increasingly available for diet recording and monitoring (Campbell & Porter, 2015). Hundreds of nutrition-related mobile apps are available, but their utility in tracking healthy food consumption and nutrition data generation is still limited. Fallaize et al. (2019) compared popular nutrition-related apps (Samsung Health, MyFitnessPal, FatSecret, Noom Coach and Lose It!) that assess macronutrients and micronutrients as well as energy from consumed food, against a reference method. They showed that apps are in general capable to assess macronutrient availability, while micronutrients estimates were inconsistent. Another similar study on nutritional apps (FatSecret, YAZIO, Fitatu, MyFitnessPal and Dine4Fit) showed inconsistent results on macronutrients and energy intake estimates (Bzikowska-Jura et al., 2021). The efforts to use digital diet information collected by these or similar apps are so far very limited (Martinon et al., 2022), although they offer large potential. Smartphone image-based automatic food recognition and dietary assessment tools are currently emerging. These tools are attempting to identify, classify and estimate volume of food intake and nutrient content estimation. Machine learning and deep learning approaches are also now being used for classifying food items in a meal, which depends on generic and comprehensive food image datasets for training data. Deep learning approaches including convolutional neural network have been suggested as being more effective than machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) for this purpose due to their higher classiﬁcation efﬁciency (Ciocca et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the quantiﬁcation of the mass of food by visual assessment of volume and density is much more challenging. The estimation of calories and nutrients can be error prone due to poor classiﬁcation and mass estimations. Further research and development of fully automated nutritional content detection applications using smartphones may transform it to a game changer for nutritional data (Subhi et al., 2019). An assessment of the meal snapp app by Keeney et al. (2016) showed that caloriﬁc values generated by such apps are comparable to standard application (Nutritionist 11 Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Security: Concept, Datasets... 223 Pro™ used by dietitians). Nevertheless, user-documented diet data availability for analytical purposes tends to be constrained by lack of harmonization in collection of data and terms of use and privacy conditions (Maringer et al., 2018). In case of developing nations, nutrition apps are mainly used at urban locations, and this may lead to a ‘digital divide’ if diet datasets from rural areas remain limited (Samoggia et al., 2021). Such a divide could be less pronounced in high-income countries. A novel digital tool that is being prototyped by CIMMYT (2022)in Bangladesh may address the possible rural-urban digital nutrition data divide in lower-income countries. This mobile app can be used by extension ofﬁcers to assess diet data of smallholders to detect potential macro- and micronutrient deﬁciencies and suggest possible seasonal crops that can be grown in their homesteads to address the potential nutritional deﬁciencies in diets. When used in larger scale, similar digital tools can also generate large-scale anonymised diet data that can be used for analytical purposes including modelling. The tool mentioned above helps extension ofﬁcers to digitalize 7-day diet diaries recorded by farm household members. Digital tools that can lead to healthy food consumption while passively collecting food consumption data can prove useful for large-scale collection of diet datasets. Such datasets can be used for more comprehensive monitoring of national-level nutritional deﬁciencies and intervention targeting (Buckland et al., 2020) and policy simulations. In addition, if digital tools are used to source information on dietary supplements or additional constituents in foods (other than those meeting basic nutritional needs) that have health impacts, the role of bioactive dietary components (Yasmeen et al., 2017) in nutritional outcomes can also be explored using such datasets (Barnett & Ferguson, 2017). Retailers’ data on food purchases by consumers is another emerging source of nutrition-related data (Saarijärvi et al., 2016). Digital data generated at points of sale (POS) can be used for consumption pattern recognition and then mobilized to promote healthier consumption behaviour. Application such as ‘NutriSavings’, a healthy grocery shopping reward programme in the United States, attempted to inﬂuence consumers’ decision to purchase healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables while reducing unhealthy fats, sugars and sodium using POS data (Nierenberg et al., 2019). Applications of point-of-sale nutrition data therefore could be advantageous in understanding nutrition consumption behaviour in developed countries and urban areas of developing nations. Social media analytics (SMA) is also an emerging ﬁeld for dietary data col- lection, behaviour analytics and population health assessments (Stirling et al., 2021). SMA is currently in data preparation and exploration phase, and future developments in quantitative data generation and analytics is expected to contribute towards nutritional surveillance and triangulation of other nutritional datasets. SMA applications in opinion mining, sentiment and content analysis and predictive analytics related to nutrition and health are emerging (Stirling et al., 2021). Initial studies on SMA show its high potential to yield policy insights similar to large surveys (Shah et al., 2020). 224 T.S Amjath-Babu et al. 11.6 The Way Forward The ideal (for computational social science applications) scenario (Fig. 11.2)is that all kinds of diet and nutrition data sources, such as the harmonized diet data from multi-indicator and other nutrition-related surveys, high frequency data from telephone surveys, diet data from mobile applications aiming nutritional advise, diet data from image-based diet detection applications, consumption information from point-of-sale data, diet- and nutrition-related social media data getting aggregated to a single data platform. These kinds of large datasets can be used for machine or deep learning as well as for simulation and modelling studies (e.g. FARMSIM) or for more conventional statistical analysis. Such national nutritional data-sharing plat- form can also include spatial data related to food supply chains, food environment and external factors so that major drivers can be diagnosed for observed diet patterns and for predictive analytics. The creation of uniﬁed platform for interoperable digital data can facilitate analytics that could in turn result in more insightful policy advice. The challenge is in the developing agreements with private ﬁrms and public agencies who are data holders to ensure the data access to researchers and the privacy of users and respondents. There is a need of policy innovations that encourage the creation of centralized data-sharing platforms, especially on nutritional data that allow researchers to analyse and derive policy insights that can lead to achievement of sustainable development goals. Several recent studies showed the viability of using satellite data and mobile operator call detail records (CDR) to predict poverty levels at higher frequency and Fig. 11.2 Idealized national data platform for digital diet data and nutritional information. In case of data ﬂows, the thick arrow shows the existing data stream, the thinner arrows represent novel data streams and dotted arrows represent upcoming and future data streams 11 Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Security: Concept, Datasets... 225 spatial granularity (Pokhriyal & Jacques, 2017; Steele et al., 2017). There are also attempts to track poverty using e-commerce data (Wijaya et al., 2022) and mobile money transactions data (Engelmann et al., 2018). Once large-scale geographic location-speciﬁc diet and nutrition datasets are available, it may also be possible to make predictions regarding diet patterns and nutritional deﬁciencies using satellite, CDR data, mobile money or e-commerce transactions. Social media data can also complement such nutritional surveillance. This kind of near real-time monitoring of agri-food systems components and nutritional analytics could potentially results in important new insights for policy, given the current infrequent and inadequate food consumption and nutrition-related data and limited capacity of the modelling tools. The chapter provides an overview of signiﬁcant challenges in agriculture and nutrition policy development and presents emerging digital data sources and com- putational social science methods that can potentially address the stated challenges. Given the right analytical framework, data platforms and enabling conditions, com- putational social science techniques can unravel the complex impact pathways to nutritional outcomes and contribute signiﬁcantly to addressing the global burden of overweight, obesity, malnutrition, hunger and nutrition-related non-communicable diseases.

Chapter 12 Big Data and Computational Social Science for Economic Analysis and Policy Sebastiano Manzan Abstract The goal of this chapter is to survey the recent applications of big data in economics and ﬁnance. An important advantage of these large alternative datasets is that they provide very detailed information about economic behaviour and decisions which has spurred research aiming at answering long-standing economic questions. Another relevant characteristic of these datasets is that they might be available in real time, a property that can be used to construct economic indicators at high frequencies. Overall, big alternative datasets have the potential to make an impact on economic research and policy and to complement the information used by governmental agencies to produce the ofﬁcial statistics. 12.1 Introduction Computational social science (CSS) can be broadly deﬁned as the area of the social sciences that makes computing power an essential tool to conduct the analysis. The ﬁeld has a long tradition in economics that goes back to the 1970s when economists started to use computers to solve numerically economic models. Since then, there has been an exponential growth in applications as documented by four Handbooks of Computational Economics published between 1996 and 2018 (see Amman et al., 1996; Hommes & LeBaron, 2018; Schmedders & Judd, 2013; Tesfatsion & Judd, 2006). Computational economics can be broadly characterized in three main areas of activity: numerical methods to solve economic models, agent-based models, and computationally intensive techniques to analyse and model big datasets. The limited goal of this chapter is to provide an overview that focuses on the analysis and modelling of large datasets, while I refer to Fontana and Guerzoni (2023) in this Handbook for a review of agent-based models (ABM) and their use in economic problems. The availability of big data offers the possibility to investigate S.

Manzan long-lasting questions using more detailed information about economic behaviour. In addition, these datasets allow to uncover new empirical facts that were not previously known due to lack of information. What exactly is “big data” in the context of economic applications? It can be deﬁned as datasets that require advanced computing hardware and/or software tools to conduct the analysis. One such tool is distributed computing that shares the processing of a task across several machines, instead of a single machine as typically done by economists. Examples of large datasets used in economic analysis are administrative data (e.g. tax records for the whole population of a country), commercial datasets (e.g. consumer panels), and textual data (e.g. such as Twitter or news data) just to mention a few. In some cases, the datasets are structured and ready for analysis, while in other cases (e.g. text), the data is unstructured and requires a preliminary step to extract and organize the relevant information. As discussed in Einav and Levin (2014), economists are still in the early stages of analysing big data and are learning from developments in other disciplines. In particular, there is renewed interest in machine learning (ML) algorithms after the early applications of the 1990s (Kuan & White, 1994). Varian (2014) discusses techniques that can be used to analyse large datasets. How can big data contribute to a better understanding of the economy and to support policy? In the highly aggregate context of macroeconomic analysis, big data offer the opportunity to bring to light the heterogeneity in consumers and ﬁrms that is typically neglected in ofﬁcial statistics. The high granularity of big datasets can be exploited to construct indicators that are better designed to explain certain phenomena, for example, along a geographic or demographic dimension. In addition, many economic models make assumptions about deep behavioural parameters that are difﬁcult to estimate without detailed datasets. An example is represented by the work of Chetty et al. (2014b) where individual information about the school performance of a child is matched to his/her path of future earnings derived from tax data of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In other situations, big data allow to measure quantities that we could not measure until now. A ﬁeld that is beneﬁting from these alternative sources of data is development economics. For instance, Storeygard (2016) uses night-light satellite data to estimate the income of sub-Saharan African cities. Another important dimension in which big data can contribute to economic analysis is by offering information that is not only more granular but also more frequent in the time dimension. At times when economic conditions are rapidly changing, policy-makers need an accurate measure of the state of the economy to design the appropriate policy response. An example is provided by the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 when policy-makers felt the pressure to act in support of the economy despite the lack of ofﬁcial statistics to measure the extent of the slump, as discussed by Barbaglia et al. (2022). Many relevant economic indicators are observed infrequently, such as gross domestic product (GDP) at the quarterly frequency and the unemployment rate and the industrial production index at the monthly frequency. In addition, these variables are released with delays that range from a few days to several months. For these reasons, big data have the 12 Big Data and Computational Social Science for Economic Analysis and Policy 233 potential to produce indicators of business conditions that are more accurate and timely. More generally, private companies are amassing signiﬁcant amounts of data that could be used to complement ofﬁcial statistics and inform economic policy. As discussed by Bostic et al. (2016), the approach of governmental agencies to produce ofﬁcial statistics is based, to a large extent, on consumer and business surveys. The approach guarantees the accuracy and the representativeness of the sample, although it comes at the cost of being an expensive and time-consuming exercise. Hence, the availability of alternative datasets offers the possibility of extracting information that can complement the evidence obtained from the surveys (a deeper analysis on the issue of the use of digital trace data and unconventional data in ofﬁcial statistics can be found in Signorelli et al., 2023). However, we are also faced with a new set of issues regarding data governance and ethics issues as discussed by Taylor (2023) in this Handbook. The chapter is organized as follows. I ﬁrst review some of the recent work in economics and ﬁnance that leverages large datasets and emphasize the role of big data in allowing the researcher to conduct the analysis. I then draw some conclusions and discuss areas of potential development of the ﬁeld. 12.2 Big Data in Economics In this sect. 12.1, I discuss the main ﬁndings of recent applications of big data in economics and ﬁnance. I organize the discussion by data source with the intention to provide a more consistent review of the results. The goal of this section is not to be exhaustive, but rather to offer a concise overview of some of the main applications of big data to economics. 12.2.1 Administrative Data Administrative data refer to data collected by governmental agencies as part of their mandate. As discussed by Card et al. (2010), the main advantages of administrative data, relative to surveys, are their large samples, the low attrition and non-response rates, and the small measurement error. In addition, administrative datasets are very detailed in terms of the information available regarding individuals. However, the researcher is confronted with signiﬁcant challenges in conducting the analysis given the restricted access to the data. Typically, the researcher is required to provide the code to the government agency that actually conducts the analysis, slowing down signiﬁcantly the development of the research project. An inﬂuential paper using tax record data is Chetty et al. (2014). The goal of the paper is to investigate intergenerational mobility in the USA. They use a sample of 40 million children born between 1980 and 1982 and relate their income at age 234 S. Manzan 30 to the parents’ income. This administrative dataset represents a unique setting to evaluate intergenerational mobility since it provides a large sample going back to the 1980 and allows to link children and parents with very high accuracy. Information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) is used in Kopczuk et al. (2010) to investigate income inequality and social mobility in the USA starting in 1937. They ﬁnd that inequality decreased up to the early 1950s and increased steadily since then. In terms of social mobility, they show that it has been relatively constant over time, including at the top end of the income distribution. Big administrative datasets are also used to evaluate educational attainments and teaching effectiveness. Dobbie and Fryer (2011) uses administrative data from the New York City Department of Education to evaluate the effect of charter school programmes on students’ achievement. The evidence suggests that charter schools have a signiﬁcant positive effect on improving the academic performance of poor children across several metrics. One of the possible explanations for these improvements is that the schools employ high-quality teachers. The issue of measuring the quality of the teachers and their impact on student performance is investigated by Chetty et al. (2014a) and Chetty et al. (2014b). They use a sample of one million students and match data from the school districts and tax records to track the evolution of earnings for the children in the sample. They ﬁnd that measures of teacher’s value added (VA), such as student’s test scores, do not show a signiﬁcant bias as proxies of teacher’s quality. In addition, by matching students to their subsequent tax record, Chetty et al. (2014b) ﬁnd that elementary school teachers with higher VA have a positive effect on college attendance and average earnings, among other measures. Another source of administrative data is the credit register used by Jiménez et al. (2014) to evaluate the effect of monetary policy on bank’s lending behaviour. The credit register records all loans and contracts between the public and the banking sector in a country. They show that a lower interest rate has the effect of increasing bank’s risk-taking behaviour which leads to an increase in the supply of credit, in particular to more risky borrowers. 12.2.2 Financial Data Financial transaction data represent a prominent source of big data in economic analysis. An early application is represented by Gross and Souleles (2002)that use a random sample of 24 thousand credit card accounts to investigate the effect on debt of changes to credit limits. Their results show that individuals respond to an increase in credit limits by borrowing more, in particular for those that started near the limit. Another more recent application using credit card data is Gallagher and Hartley (2017) that use a random 5% sample of individuals with credit history. They use hurricane Katrina as a natural experiment and ﬁnd that households that lived in areas most affected by the ﬂood experienced large reductions in debt, mostly due to the decline in home loan obligations. Horvath et al. (2021) use credit card data to 12 Big Data and Computational Social Science for Economic Analysis and Policy 235 evaluate the behaviour of consumers during the 2020 pandemic. They ﬁnd that credit card spending and balances declined rapidly during March/April 2020, in particular in areas with the highest incidence of cases. The recovery in spending started in May 2020 with riskier borrowers leading the way relative to those with high credit score. Dunn et al. (2020) use daily credit card data to assess the geographical and sectoral impact of the pandemic on consumer spending. They show that their measure of spending closely proxy for the monthly retail trade ofﬁcial statistic, which demonstrates the beneﬁt of using big data to monitor the economy in real time. A similar analysis is provided in Bodas et al. (2019) and Carvalho et al. (2020) for Spain. Calvet et al. (2009) use administrative data on the asset holdings and demo- graphic information of all taxpayers in Sweden. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the ﬁnancial sophistication of households in avoiding investment mistakes, such as under-diversiﬁcation, inertia in risk taking, and holding losing stocks while selling winning stocks. They ﬁnd that households with higher wealth and education levels are more sophisticated and less prone to investment mistakes. 12.2.3 Labour Markets Labour market statistics have historically been data-rich due to the direct involve- ment of government agencies in the administration of unemployment beneﬁts. Recently, private companies have started collecting information about the labour market. Naturally, the question is the representativeness of these private datasets for the overall labour market and the US economy. Horton and Tambe (2015)is a recent survey of the various sources of alternative labour market data that have emerged in recent years and provide a detailed discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of using such data. Napierala and Kvetan (2023) in this Handbook provide a complementary analysis of the role that big data can play in the analysis of the evolution of job skills. An example of the use of alternative labour market data for policy is provided by Cajner et al. (2019). They use payroll data from the private company ADP to construct employment measures similar to those constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) using the Current Employment Statistics (CES). They ﬁnd that the two measures of employment complement each other and jointly they provide information about the dynamics of the labour market. This is a very important contribution since it shows that alternative data can provide information that is complementary and highly correlated with ofﬁcial statistics. The additional advan- tage of these private data sources is that they are available at higher frequencies and allow the researcher to segment the sample geographically and by demographic characteristics. This beneﬁt is discussed in Cajner et al. (2020) that shows the real- time behaviour of the weekly employment measure during the Covid-19 pandemic relative to the monthly ofﬁcial statistic from CES. Similar results are also obtained by Gregory and Zhu (2014). 236 S. Manzan 12.2.4 Textual Data An alternative source of data that is gaining interest in economics and ﬁnance is textual data. In this case, the goal is to use text from newspapers, speeches, company reports, and Twitter, among others, to construct measures that help understand economic behaviour or predict economic variables. Gentzkow et al. (2019) provide a recent overview of the work done so far. An important source of text data is newspaper articles that might be considered a proxy for the information set available to the public when making an economic decision. An early paper is Tetlock (2007) that extracts sentiment from a column of The Wall Street Journal and ﬁnds that it is useful to predict daily returns of the aggregate market. Baker et al. (2016) aim at measuring economic and political uncertainty by counting the number of articles that contain a set of keywords associated with uncertainty. They show that their measure is highly correlated with measures of uncertainty. Other recent applications analyse news to construct proxies for economic sentiment (see Barbaglia et al., forthcoming;Larsen & Thorsrud, 2019; Shapiro et al., 2020; Thorsrud, 2020). Monitoring the sentiment of consumers and businesses has a long tradition in economics, and it is typically based on surveys. The contribution of these papers is to show that sentiment based on newspaper articles has a similar behaviour to survey-based sentiment. These indicators are found to have forecasting power for several macroeconomic variables that is incremental relative to the typical macroeconomic predictors (Barbaglia et al., forthcoming). Larsen and Thorsrud (2019) investigate the relation between news and consumer expectations and ﬁnd that the topics extracted from the news contribute to explain the consumers’ decision to update their inﬂation expectations. Another line of research has investigated the role of communication in the implementation of monetary policy. Hansen and McMahon (2016)use the text of verbal and written communication by the Federal Reserve to understand its role in predicting economic variables. They ﬁnd that the forward guidance embedded in the central bank statements is more relevant relative to the communication of the state of the economy. Hansen et al. (2018) investigate the role of increasing transparency in the central bank communication by analysing the internal deliberation of the policy-makers. They ﬁnd that their communication patterns changed signiﬁcantly after transparency was introduced. The GDELT project1 is another source of textual data that has been used in several applications. Consoli et al. (2021) use sentiment analysis to understand the dynamics of sovereign yields in Europe. Acemoglu et al. (2018) use GDELT to identify events of political and social unrest in Egypt and to evaluate their effect on stock returns. A data source that is gathering momentum in economic and ﬁnancial analysis is Twitter. Baker et al. (2021) use Twitter messages to construct a Twitter Economic 1 More information about GDELT is available at https://www.gdeltproject.org/. 12 Big Data and Computational Social Science for Economic Analysis and Policy 237 Uncertainty (TEU) indicator similar to the EPU indicator proposed by Baker et al. (2021) that is based on newspaper articles. Their results show that there is a very high correlation between TEU and EPU. 12.2.5 Mobile Phone Data Mobile phone data represents an additional source of big data for economic analysis. This type of data is potentially very high dimensional since it tracks the location of a user over time. An economic application is represented by Blumenstock et al. (2015) that use mobile phone data to measure the socio-economic status of the caller. This is a particularly useful initiative for developing countries where ofﬁcial statistics are not very reliable and well-developed. Milusheva (2020) uses mobile phone data to track the effect of the movement of people from high-disease areas to low-disease areas on malaria spreading. A similar idea is developed in Iacus et al. (2020)that investigate the effect of the containment measures on the spreading of the Covid-19 virus. Their ﬁndings suggest that a measure of mobility constructed from mobile phone data is a highly accurate predictor of the initial spread of the virus in Italy and France. 12.2.6 Internet Data The emergence of the internet has created the opportunity for researchers to collect online data to proxy for economic variables of interest (see Edelman, 2012,for a detailed discussion). An example is provided by the emergence of eBay as a marketplace for the exchange of goods that allowed economists to test market design mechanisms and to investigate the behaviour of bidders and sellers. An early paper is Bajari and Hortacsu (2003) that examine the empirical regularities of eBay auctions and estimate a model of bidding. An area of intense recent work has been measuring social ties based on online platform, such as Facebook. Bailey et al. (2018a) discuss the construction of the Social Connectedness Index (SCI) which measures the friendship connections between Facebook users living in different geographical areas of the USA and abroad. An application of the SCI to explain the housing market is provided in Bailey et al. (2018b). They ﬁnd that social connections contribute to explain the surge in house prices which they argue to be the result of the similarity of experience and expectations about the housing market. Cavallo and Rigobon (2016) uses price data that are scraped from online stores to construct measures of inﬂation. These measures are found to track well the ofﬁcial statistics and have the advantage that can be calculated at high frequencies. Goolsbee and Klenow (2018) use a large dataset of e-commerce transactions to 238 S. Manzan calculate the inﬂation rate. They ﬁnd that during the period 2014–2017, the inﬂation rate was 3% lower relative to the ofﬁcial Consumer Price Index (CPI). Another big dataset that has recently gained interest among economists is Google Trends. It represents a measure of the intensity of queries in the Google search engine regarding a set of keywords in a certain geographic area. The big data feature of Google Trends is that the time series for the search terms is the outcome of the aggregation across millions of queries by Google users around the world. Google Trends can be interpreted as a sentiment measure since it captures the public interest on a speciﬁc topic at a certain point in time. An early contribution using Google Trends is Choi and Varian (2012) that ﬁnds that including appropriately selected trends improves the accuracy of nowcasts for several economic variables. D’Amuri and Marcucci (2017) use job search-related queries to forecast the unemployment rate in the USA. Their results show that using Google Trends improves accuracy also relative to professional forecasters and are particularly accurate during turning points that are difﬁcult to predict in real time. Castelnuovo and Tran (2017) construct an indicator that they call Google Trends Uncertainty (GTU) that aims at capturing Economic and Political Uncertainty (EPU) in the spirit of Baker et al. (2016)using series from Google Trends. 12.2.7 Other Data An interesting application of seismic data to economics is represented by Tiozzo Pezzoli and Tosetti (2021). They use seismic data to identify vibrations produced by human activity, such as air and road trafﬁc and manufacturing activity among others. They ﬁnd that the indicator they construct is strongly correlated with several ofﬁcial measures of economic activity. Another source of alternative big data is obtained from satellite images that are used in a variety of CSS applications. However, only recently, economists realized the potential of satellite image data for economic analysis. Donaldson and Storeygard (2016) and Gibson et al. (2020) provide overviews of the application of satellite data in economics and a primer on remote sensing. Chen and Nordhaus (2011) use night-light satellite data to improve GDP mea- sures for developing countries, which is particularly relevant when ofﬁcial statistics are missing. The paper shows that luminosity provides informational value that can help improve the accuracy of output measures. Galimberti (2020) performs a similar exercise with the focus on the forecasting ability of the measures of economic activity based on the luminosity data. The results indicate that these measures are useful to improve the accuracy of simple forecasting models, although country- speciﬁc models deliver better forecast performance relative to the pooled model. In a similar context, Hu and Yao (2021) propose an econometric methodology to use luminosity to improve GDP measures. Henderson et al. (2011) provides a detailed discussion of applications of night lights to measure national income, in particular in the case of developing economies. Another application of night-light 12 Big Data and Computational Social Science for Economic Analysis and Policy 239 data is represented by Storeygard (2016) that evaluates whether the distance of cities from a port inﬂuenced their growth in sub-Saharan African countries. The role of the satellite data in this case is to provide a measure of economic activity at the city level that are not otherwise available from ofﬁcial statistics. 12.3 Conclusion The discussion in this chapter demonstrates how big data can be valuable to answer long-standing questions and to test the validity of economic assumptions. An illustration is the work with administrative data discussed earlier that shows the great potential of providing economic researchers access to these data, but highlights also the severe limitations of scaling up the availability of these data to a wider audience of users. Another challenge is represented by the fact that many of these alternative datasets are collected by private companies that might have low incentives to share the data with researchers. However, big data have a signiﬁcant public role to play which calls for a framework that facilitates sharing of the information. An example of the public relevance of using big data is to produce real-time indicators of business conditions. In this respect, the collaboration between the Federal Reserve and the payroll processor ADP (Cajner et al., 2019) indicates how the private big dataset can complement the existing information provided by statistical agencies to support economic policy in real time. This collaboration is likely to set the path for more extensive partnerships between the private sector and statistical agencies. As argued in Bostic et al. (2016), the current model of the production of economic data is the domain of governmental agencies that are funding and running the collection of data, typically in the form of consumer and business surveys. This model is likely to evolve in the future as companies collect increasing amounts of economic data that are valuable, and most likely cheaper, to the production of ofﬁcial statistics.

Chapter 13 Changing Job Skills in a Changing World Joanna Napierala and Vladimir Kvetan Abstract Digitalization, automation, robotization and green transition are key current drivers changing the labour markets and the structure of skills needed to perform tasks within jobs. Mitigating skills shortages in this dynamic world requires an adequate response from key stakeholders. However, recommendations derived from the traditional data sources, which lack granularity or are available with a signiﬁcant time lag, may not address the emerging issues rightly. At the same time, society’s increasing reliance on the use of the Internet for day- to-day needs, including the way individuals search for a job and match with employers, generates a considerable amount of timely and high granularity data. Analysing such nontraditional data as content of online job advertisements may help understand emerging issues across sectors and regions and allow policy makers to act accordingly. In this chapter, we are drawing on experience setting the Cedefop project based on big data and presenting examples of other numerous research projects to conﬁrm the potential of using nontraditional sources of information in addressing a variety of research questions related to the topic of changing skills in a changing world. 13.1 Introduction We live in the world where huge amount of data on almost any aspect of our life is produced and collected. Capturing, understanding and fully exploiting nontraditional data, through advanced analytics, machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence, might yield beneﬁts for policy makers. For example, the dynamic changes on the labour markets driven by digitalization, automation, robotization and green transition require adequate response of key players to mitigate skills shortages. The timely understanding of emerging issues across sectors and regions J. Napierala (\u0002) · V.

Kvetan would allow policy makers to better manage strands of education and training (E&T) policy and better design labour market policies. The relevance of this issues is underlined by the related policy questions in a recently published European Commission policy report (European Commission, Joint Research Centre, 2022). Below we will discuss how the analysis of nontraditional data might allow to address various questions, for which the granularity of traditional data was not adequate, such as: • Which are the most demanded skills brought about by the recent changes in labour markets? • Is there a gap between the supply and demand side with respect to skills? • What is the best possible way to reskill and upskill individuals building on their current skill sets? • Are “new skills” concentrated in speciﬁc economic sectors or regions? Against this background the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) has taken up the challenge to integrate its work on skills intelligence making use of big data collected via web sourcing of online job advertisements. 1 Drawing on Cedefop’s work and expertise, in this chapter we will focus on the presentation of existing research that based analysis on nontraditional data or applied data science or AI-based analytical approaches to better understand ongoing changes in skills. 13.2 Existing Literature Traditionally, the labour market intelligence (LMI) was based on information collected via well-established surveys or administrative data. In the rapidly changing labour market, job seekers, teachers and trainers search for timely and more ﬁne- grained information to support their decisions. As the recent society more and more relies on the Internet for the day-to-day needs, it naturally changes also the way employer-employee job matching process occurs. With the growing number of employers who use websites to reach out for potential candidates and also the increase of users searching for jobs online, the analysis based on the information extracted from online job advertisements (OJAs) became the most promising approach for addressing some of the most relevant questions that new labour market trends are posing (Colombo et al., 2018). Potential of labour market systems based on big data lays in giving access to a greater variety of data sources producing information beyond ability of traditional survey. This allows for labour market comparisons at regional level and for subpopulations, as well as at the level of skills 2 rather than occupations. Yet, these systems are not 1 https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/projects/skills-online-job-advertisements 2 In this chapter we will not make distinction between skills and competences or knowledge, but the interested reader could refer to the discussions on this topic that are summarized in, e.g. paper by Rodrigues, M., Fernandez Macias, E., and Sostero, M. (2021). A uniﬁed conceptual framework of 13 Changing Job Skills in a Changing World 245 free from shortcomings, e.g. not suitable for long-term projections, having limits in representativeness related to coverage or completeness and subject of missing data as a result of inconsistencies in unstructured text [see Naughtin et al. (2017)and Cedefop et al. (2021)]. Although these examples come from mainly one-off and exploratory research projects, which very often are based on one data source, they still conﬁrm the capacity of using online job advertisements in a variety of analysis. The potential of this source of information to draw conclusions about labour market trends across multiple dimensions as occupation, geography, level of education and the type of contract was conﬁrmed in the study by Tkalec et al. (2020). Moreover, there were various examples of efforts to identify skills for emerging jobs, for example, skill requirements for business and data analytics positions (Verma et al., 2019), for ICT and statistician positions (Lovaglio et al., 2018) and for software engineering jobs (Gurcan & Cagiltay, 2019; Papoutsoglou et al., 2019). Few studies focused on skills identiﬁcation in speciﬁc sectors—IT (Ternikov & Aleksandrova, 2020), tourism (Marrero-Rodríguez et al., 2020) and manufacturing (Leigh et al., 2020)—or requested for speciﬁc occupations: computer scientist positions (Grüger & Schneider, 2019), various types of analyst positions (Nasir et al., 2020) or skills requested in the public health job (Watts et al., 2019). Alekseeva et al. (2019) searched online job advertisements data for terms related to artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) to understand which professions are demanding these skills. The jobs informa- tion collected over time allows identiﬁcation of trends in the skill set requirements for different industries as done by Prüfer and Prüfer (2019), who provided insights into the dynamics of demand for entrepreneurial skills in the Netherlands and also identiﬁed professions for which entrepreneurial skills are particularly important. Fabo et al. (2017) analysed how important are foreign language skills in the labour markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Pater et al. (2019) analysed demand for transversal skills on Polish labour market. Dawson et al. (2021a) used longitudinal job advertisements data to analyse changes in journalists’ skills and understand changes in the situation of this occupation group on the Australian labour market. Although a growing number of employers use the web to advertise job openings, this data is still being criticized for being more skewed toward employers seeking more highly skilled professions or those more exposed to the Internet (Carnevale et al., 2014; Kureková et al., 2015b). Nevertheless, Beblavý et al. (2016)using Slovak job portals or Kureková et al. (2015a) using Czech, Irish and Danish publicly administered cross-European job search portal data delivered evidence on skills requested speciﬁcally in low- and medium-skilled occupations. Wardrip et al. (2015) focused on understanding employers’ educational preferences studying medium- skilled job advertisements. tasks, skills and competences. JRC Working Papers Series on Labour, education and Technology, 2021/02. https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/sites/default/ﬁles/jrc121897.pdf 246 J. Napierala and V. Kvetan The extraction of information on skills level allows to calculate different types of skills required (e.g. soft, transversal, digital) and therefore better understand how soft and hard skills inﬂuence each other which was analysed by Borner et al. (2018). The potential of extending studies on labour market polarization by including the information on relevance of speciﬁc skills and skill bundles was indicated in few studies (Alabdulkareem et al., 2018;Salvatori, 2018;Xu et al., 2021). The skills- based approach to study possible transitions from lower-wage into better-paying occupations based on online job advertisements data was explored by Demaria et al. (2020). The rich structure of neural language models encourages researchers to make attempts in building more sophisticated models, e.g. that predicts wages from job postings’ text [see Bana (2021)]. Building online job advertisements databases over extended periods of time allows introducing longitudinal perspective into the analysis. For example, Adams- Prassl et al. (2020) used job advertisements data to get more insights into deter- minants of employers’ demand for ﬂexible work arrangements. Blair and Deming (2020) analysed changes in demand for skills in the USA indicating that increase in the demand for graduates with bachelor’s degree is of structural rather than cyclical nature. Shandra (2020) analysed trends in skills requirements of internship positions. Das et al. (2020) explored how occupational task demands have changed over the past decade due to AI innovation. Acemoglu et al. (2020) studied AI effects on the labour market, indicating the increase in demand for AI skills after 2014. Recently, the job advertisements data were used to study the impact of introduced social distancing measures during Covid-19 pandemic on the labour market in the EU (Pouliakas & Branka, 2020). Similar analysis carried out on the Covid-19 impact on labour market demand in the USA gave insights about state- level, for essential and non-essential sectors, and teleworkable and non-teleworkable occupations (Forsythe et al., 2020). Using real-time labour market data can also bring valuable insight on the reasons of the low employability of graduates and help learners make informed decisions about acquisition of skills requested by employers. Persaud (2020) combined information extracted from job postings and from programmes offered by universities and colleges and identiﬁed what skills employers are seeking for big data analytics professions and to what extent these competencies are acquired by students. Universities may use AI-based analytics for mapping of competences from job adverts and compare them with curricula and course descriptions to better design future education offer (Ketamo et al., 2019). Borner et al. (2018) systematically analysed the interplay of job advertisement contents, courses and degrees offered and publication records to understand skills gaps and proposed not only methodology but also visualizations to ease making data-driven decisions by less tech-savvy stakeholders’ groups. Brüning and Mangeol (2020)using job posting data analysed geographical differences in demand for graduates’ skills in the USA. They tried to ﬁnd the answers on what skills employers look when searching for graduates that did not follow the vocational career pathway. They looked also how open are employers in need of ICT specialist to hire graduates from other study ﬁelds (ibidem). 13 Changing Job Skills in a Changing World 247 Although there is little evidence that individuals when receiving supporting infor- mation from job recommending tools change their job search behaviour (Hensvik et al., 2020) and also that such recommending tools are effectively decreasing skills mismatches on the labour market, the recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence has spurred research contributions in the areas of career pathway planning, curriculum planning, job transition tools and software supporting job search. The advancements in extraction of information on skills based on online job advertisement lead to the proposals of solutions of the job searching tools allowing to ﬁlter recommendations by skill set and company attribute (e.g. size, revenue) (Muthyala et al., 2017)or proposal of models that can be used in building job prediction applications based on descriptions of user knowledge and skills (Van Huynh et al., 2020). There are also solutions being developed (based on vacancies information) that given starting sets of skills recommend job options which are not only matched with individual skill sets (Giabelli et al., 2020b, 2021) but also aligned with career ambitions and personal interests of job seeker (Sadro & Klenk, 2021). The aggregation of data sources on skills with job advertisements data and education offer (e.g. from local university, database of online courses) allows for building solutions with more personalized career information, advice and guidance. Such recommendation tools have a matching solution with in-built information from existing sources on education offer that provides job seekers with information about potential career opportunities together with information what courses to take to acquire missing skills. At the same time, these tools account for the available time to learn new skills a job seeker/person interested in changing profession has (Sadro & Klenk, 2021). Recommendation tools powered by labour market information could be personalized even further, for example, to allow job opportunities to be ﬁltered to match individuals’ health requirements (Sadro & Klenk, 2021) or commuting expectations of job seeker (Berg, 2018; Sadro & Klenk, 2021). Networking websites for matching workers with employers could serve as source of information to give more insights about demand but also about supply of skills. From the demand perspective, such data allows to retrieve additional company metadata to investigate the relationship between company characteristics and workers’ skills (Chang et al., 2019). Information extracted from workers’ career proﬁles allows to extend the analysis to differentiate skills from entry- to middle- to top-level jobs. Such data was used to test the effectiveness of proposed framework to predict career trajectory with in-built time variable that allows to account for different length of workers’ experience (Wang, 2021). The networking websites may allow also for checking which job advertisements were visited more frequently and which information could be used, e.g. to improve analysis on the tightness of the labour market (Adrjan & Lydon, 2019). The information about users’ skills from online CV proﬁles could also be used as an input in career guiding tools as proposed by Ghosh et al. (2020) to support people in their decisions on which skills to acquire to achieve their career goals. The analysis of big data of real changes in careers allows getting more understanding into possibilities for intersectoral mobility (International Labour Organization, 2020). Natural language processing (NLP) solutions were applied to ﬁnd overlapping 248 J. Napierala and V. Kvetan skills between occupations based on which potential job transition was established (Kanders et al., 2020). Dawson et al. (2021b) built job transitions recommender system getting more insights of similar sets of skills by combining information from longitudinal datasets of real-time job advertisements and occupational transitions from a household survey. In the ongoing project (Cedefop, 2020), the analysis based on data about labour market transitions extracted from more than 10 million anonymized CVs from across EU member states was carried out to feed the recommendation tool. 3 This tool will support job seekers by providing them with information on occupations alternative to their own. Allowing the worker for identiﬁcation of skills which acquisition would yield the highest utility gains could translate into the improvement of his/her employment outcomes and increase his/her productivity. Sun (2021) presented a new data-driven skill recommendation tool based on deep reinforcement learning solution that also allows to account for learning difﬁculty. Stephany (2021) combining information about freelancers’ skills and wages calculated the marginal gains of learning a new skill. Insights from this study could help designing individual reskilling pathways and help to increase individuals’ employability. There is ongoing feasibility study 4 which aims is to explore the potential of information extracted from work platforms that play intermediary role on the labour market, in better understanding of interplay between workers’ skills, tasks and occupations. 13.3 Computational Guidelines The growing body of knowledge on labour market generated based on the online sources translated into the increasing interest in taking advantage of the skills intelligence for policy making. In 2014, Cedefop started building a pan-European system to collect and classify online job advertisements data. The initial phase included only ﬁve EU countries. Yet, with time the project was scaled up and extended to the whole EU, including all 27 Member States + UK and all 24 ofﬁcial languages of the EU (Cedefop, 2019). This positive experience led Cedefop to join efforts with Eurostat (and creation of its Web Intelligence Hub) in developing well- documented data production system that has big data element integrated into the production of ofﬁcial statistics (Descy et al., 2019). Yet, the retrieval of good- quality and robust information from online data sources to deliver labour market analysis in an efﬁcient way is still a challenging task. The identiﬁed key challenges in using online job advertisements (OJAs) for skills and labour market analysis are 3 The open source codes and libraries are shared on the project website: https://cran.r-project.org/ web/packages/labourR/index.html. 4 It is part of Cedefop/Eurostat project titled “Towards the European Web Intelligence Hub— European System for Collection and Analysis of Online Job Advertisement Data (WIH-OJA)” carried out in the 2020–2024 period under the contract reference number: AO/DSL/VKVET- JBRAN/WIH-OJA/002/20. 13 Changing Job Skills in a Changing World 249 representativeness, completeness, maturity, simpliﬁcation, duplication and status of vacancies (International Labour Organization, 2020). The computational challenges with building reliable time series data based on collecting information from online data sources can be grouped into four areas related to: • Data ingestion • Deduplication • Classiﬁcation of occupations and skills • Representativeness When the focus is on the data ingestion and landscaping part, then the source stability is one of the main technical problems, which has a direct impact on the representativeness of collected information and the reliability of further analysis. Firstly, some sources of information might be blocked from data collection not allowing for extraction of information, and prior agreements with the website’s owners will be needed to access the information. Secondly, some websites may not be available during the data extraction because of technical problems. Thirdly, there is also a natural lifecycle of the online sources as some new websites may appear while existing ones can close or rebrand. It has been shown that inclusion of the website that contained a large volume of spurious and anonymous job postings could lead to the discrepancy with the ofﬁcial vacancy statistics (International Labour Organization, 2020). In order to ensure stability of data sources, the added value of using tools like analytic hierarchy process to help in ranking of the online sources based on various dimensions, including information coverage, update frequency, popularity and expert assessment and validation, is explored. 5 The challenges with deduplication relate to the fact that it is common that the same job advertisement appears in various sources on the Internet. This can happen either intentionally, when employer publishes OJA on more than one portal, or unintentionally due to activities of aggregators—portals that automatically crawl other websites with the view of republishing OJAs. Very often, the content of such job advertisements is almost identical differing only in a small portion of the text (e.g. date of release). There are several ways to allow for identiﬁcation of near- duplicate job advertisement to avoid counting the same information multiple times, e.g. using bag of words, shingling and hashing techniques (Lecocq, 2015). In the process of deduplication, the comparison of several ﬁelds in the job advertisement (e.g. job title, name of employer, sector) is done to determine whether it is a duplicate or not. 6 Metadata derived from job portals is another way to help identifying duplicate advertisements (e.g. reference ID, page URL). In addition, machine learning algorithms could be used to remove irrelevant content, e.g. training offers. 5 This is ongoing work carried out by Cedefop and Eurostat under WIH-OJA project mentioned earlier. 6 It should be mentioned that information from deduplicated advertisements is used to enrich the ﬁnal observation as additional information from across all sources is merged into one. 250 J. Napierala and V. Kvetan In the next phase of the data processing, the challenges relate to the classiﬁcation of occupations, and skills emerge from the fact that the information is extracted from unstructured ﬁelds of job advertisements. For example, employers might have a tendency to conceal tacitly expected requirements by explicitly mentioning only a few skills from the list of required ones in online job advertisements. Similarly, the candidates building their online career proﬁles may signal only selected skills they have, for example, indication of “Hadoop” and “Java” could infer workers’ expertise as well as for “MapReduce” (Muthyala et al., 2017). Sometimes the same word may have different meaning depending on the context, e.g. philosophy as the ﬁeld of study or as the company philosophy, informal written guidelines on how people should perform and conduct themselves at work; Java could either come from the job advertisement searching for IT or coffee making person. In general, two approaches are used in the information extraction from unstruc- tured text: cluster analysis and classiﬁcation (Ternikov & Aleksandrova, 2020). For example, Zhao et al. (2015) developed a system for skill entity recognition and normalization based on information from resumes, while Djumalieva and Slee- man (2018) used online job advertisements data and employed machine learning methods, such as word embeddings, network community detection algorithms and consensus clustering to build general skills taxonomy. In a similar way, Khaouja et al. (2019) created a taxonomy of soft skills applying combination of DBpedia and word embeddings and evaluated similarity of concepts with cosine distance. Moreover, a social network analysis was used to build a hierarchy of terms. The unavailability of high-quality training datasets was believed to constrain advancements in the use of AI in extraction of information from unstructured text. Yet, it is observed that solutions based on structured and fully semantic ontological approaches or taxonomies proved to work better allowing to extract meaningful information from online data compared to applications exclusively based on machine learning approaches (International Labour Organization, 2020; Sadro & Klenk, 2021). Nevertheless, the taxonomy-based extraction processes are not free from deﬁciencies, as the quality of extracted information tends to be as good as the underlying taxonomies used for this purpose (Cedefop et al., 2021). Plaimauer (2018) studying matches between taxonomy terms and language used in vacancies published on Austrian labour market shows that 56% of the terms from taxonomy never appeared in job advertisements. She also observed that longer terms were identiﬁed with less frequency in the vacancies’ descriptions. Grammatical cases in some language seem challenging for natural language processing tools, which often leads to misinterpretation of recognized skills (Ketamo et al., 2019). The mapping of the unstructured text (e.g. of job titles, skills) to existing taxonomies (e.g. ISCO—International Standard Classiﬁcation of Occupations) is usually done in a few steps, and pipelines are built for separate languages (Boselli et al., 2017). First the text needs to be extracted from the body of the job adverts; 13 Changing Job Skills in a Changing World 251 this could be done by bag of word or Word2Vec approach 7 (Boselli et al., 2017). In both cases the usual steps were applied to preprocess the text. 8 The bag of word extraction leads to creation of sets of n-consecutive words (so called n-grams); usu- ally unigrams or bigrams are analysed (ibidem). The Word2Vec extraction is based on replacement of each word in a title by a corresponding vector of n-dimensional space. This approach requires huge text corpora for producing meaningful vectors (ibidem). The corpuses with speciﬁc domain can signiﬁcantly improve the quality of obtained word embeddings. In the next step of the classiﬁcation pipeline, machine learning techniques (e.g. decision trees, naïve Bayes, K-nearest neighbour (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM), convolutional neural network) are applied to match with the “closest” code. The similarity is judged based on the value of one of the existing indexes of similarity (e.g. Cosine, Motyka, Ruzicka, Jaccard, Levenshtein distance, Sørensen-Dice index). The evaluation of the quality of obtained matches (e.g. between job titles and occupation classiﬁer) is not an easy task, although the problem related to matching itself is not a new one as previously some AI solutions were developed for coding of open answers on job titles provided by respondents in survey data (Schierholz & Schonlau, 2020). Yet, the main difference between the information on job titles provided by individual worker and information originating from job titles mentioned in online job advertisements is that the latter includes more extraneous information (e.g. “ideal candidate”, “involve regular travel”) and tends to be more difﬁcult to parse (Turrell et al., 2019). One way to validate that the occupation classiﬁer is generating meaningful predictions is to check the implied occupational hierarchies (Bana et al., 2021). For example, a classiﬁer that misclassiﬁes a high-skilled profession with a low-skilled one would be judged as performing worse than the one that would categorize such occupation as belonging to more general category but within adequate hierarchical occupational group. Nevertheless, Malandri et al. (2021a)who applied word embeddings approach to job advertisements data identiﬁed existing mismatches in the taxonomy compared to real market examples. In particular, analysing the market of ICT occupations, they showed that although in ESCO taxonomy data engineer and a data scientist belonged to the same occupation group, these are not similar occupations in the real labour market (ibidem). The previous studies show that the level of accuracy of extracted information depends from ﬁeld to ﬁeld and also on the level of detail, as the accuracy rate of six- digit occupation coding was about 10 percentage points lower than when done for major groups at two-digit ISCO level (Carnevale et al., 2014). A similar trade-off between more granularity and less accuracy was observed by Turrell et al. (2019) 7 Word2Vec is a technique that uses words’ proximity to each other within the corpus as an indicator of relatedness. It creates a co-occurrence matrix that shows how often each word in the corpus is found within a “window” of other adjacent words. 8 The usual steps were applied as (i) HTML tag removal, (ii) tokenization, (iii) lowercase reduction, (iv) stop words removal and (v) stemming, which will not be discussed in detail here. 252 J. Napierala and V. Kvetan who decided to use three-digit occupation classiﬁcation. Yet, using supervised algorithms it was proven to be possible at least for English language to achieve good performances (over 80%) in classifying textual job vacancies gathered from the online advertisements with respect to the fourth-level ISCO taxonomy (Boselli et al., 2017). Nevertheless, less than 85% of titles were correctly classiﬁed in the matching exercise of job titles advertised on Dutch websites with ISCO-08 ontology (Tijdens & Kaandorp, 2019). The manual check of the unclassiﬁed terms showed that job titles in vacancies could be either more specialized compared to the terms in ontology or vice versa. However, some wrong classiﬁcations also occurred despite the high reliability score of classiﬁcations for these titles that included some similar words, e.g. campaign manager versus camping manager (ibidem). Another challenge with ﬁnding matching occupation classiﬁer is that sometimes job advertisements can have generic, meaningless job titles or no title at all. Therefore, it is also important to design and train the classiﬁers that, e.g. could suggest a job title acknowledging the content of entire job description as, for example, the proposed Job-Oriented Asymmetrical Pairing System (JOAPS) by Bernard et al. (2020). Overall, the main disadvantage of classifying unstructured information with use of taxonomies is that they are not forward-looking, and the frequency of revisions that oftentimes lean on expert panels and surveys allows updating them with the information on the emerging skills and/or occupations only with substantial delays. The AI solutions were introduced to update ESCO taxonomy with information on occupations; however the detailed information on the applied procedure was not provided in the ofﬁcial reports (European Commission, 2021a, b). A tool with capacity to automatically enrich the standard occupation and skills taxonomy with terms that represent new occupations was proposed by Giabelli et al. (2020b, 2021). This tool identiﬁes the most suitable terms to be added to the taxonomy on the basis of four measures, namely, Generality, Adequacy Speciﬁcity and Comparability (GASC) (for formal deﬁnitions of these measures, see Giabelli et al. (2020a)). Very often inconsistencies in terminology used by job seekers and the jargon of employers when describing the same skills are the reasons for which the solution developers struggle when matching information from different data holders (Sadro & Klenk, 2021). One way to overcome the problem is to apply the AI and advanced linguistic understanding and build a platform which “translates” jargon of job advertisements to a simpler language for job seekers (Sadro & Klenk, 2021). The revealed comparative advantage (RCA) 9 wasused asa measure ofthe importance of a skill for an individual job by Anna Giabelli et al. (2020a)to enrich ESCO taxonomy with real labour market-derived information about skills relevance and skills similarity. 10 Another AI-based methodology to reﬁne taxonomy was proposed by Malandri et al. (2021b). The novelty of this approach is based on the 9 For formula see Alabdulkareem, A., Frank, M. R., Sun, L., AlShebli, B., Hidalgo, C., and Rahwan, I. (2018, Jul). Unpacking the polarization of workplace skills. Sci Adv, 4(7), eaao6030. https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aao6030 10 Skills similarity was measured by Jaccard index. 13 Changing Job Skills in a Changing World 253 automation of the process, which is to be carried out without involvement of experts. It is based on the implementation of domain-independent metric called hierarchical semantic similarity applied to judge the semantic similarity between new terms and taxonomic elements, which value is later used to evaluate the embeddings obtained from domain-speciﬁc corpus and, eventually, the suggestions on which new terms should be assigned to a different concept are made based on comparison of these evaluations. Chiarello et al. (2021) proposed a methodology that can be used to improve taxonomy. The innovation of this approach lays in the use of the natural language processing tools for knowledge extraction from scientiﬁc papers. The extracted terms are later linked with the existing ones allowing for identiﬁcation of these which were not included in the taxonomy before. As the ﬁnal step before starting to analyse online data, it is crucial to explore its representativeness. The sources of potential bias in online job advertisements are multiple (Ber˛esewicz & Pater, 2021). Moreover, the population of job vacancies and its structure are practically unknown, and for non-probability samples the traditional weighting cannot be used as an adjusting method (Kureková et al., 2015b). Researchers who recognize the problem of online data representativeness very often provide results of their analysis together with information from other data sources, i.e. representative surveys and registry data [e.g. Colombo et al. (2019)]. Beresewicz et al. (2021) suggest applying a combined traditional calibration with the LASSO-assisted approach to correct representation error in the online data. 13.4 The Way Forward The aim of this chapter was to map the diversity of existing research projects that used big data and artiﬁcial intelligence approaches to research the topic of changing job skills in the changing world. It also tried to summarize the computational challenges related to extraction of information from online, unstructured data and the other issues that analysts using such data may struggle with. Based on the existing evidence, suggestions were made for the design of future research projects, which in this very vivid research area may already be addressed but were not identiﬁed by us in our mapping exercise. Having said that, ﬁrstly, one needs to focus more on the understanding of the quality of applied classiﬁcation methods. Although one ongoing project that investigates the quality of job title classiﬁers was identiﬁed [see (Bana et al., 2021)], the projects focusing on design and testing of some alternative approaches with outputs allowing to understand and improve the quality of existing solutions will be welcomed. Secondly, the projects which aim at delivering comparable information across countries (e.g. Skills Online Vacancy Analysis Tool for Europe—OVATE 11) would 11 https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/data-visualisations/skills-online-vacancies 254 J. Napierala and V. Kvetan beneﬁt from further research aiming at understanding the language characteristics’ role in the extraction capacity of taxonomies or quality of these extractions. For example, the analysis on the number of extracted skills obtained in each OVATE language extraction pipeline shows huge variation across language pipelines. In general, translated version of ESCO taxonomy 12 from English to any other language used in EU countries brings lower number of extracted skills, but the reasons behind this are not known. Research projects with approach presented in Sostero and Fernández-Macías (2021) or similar approaches with other existing ontologies used as a benchmark or applied to other than English languages would be highly welcomed. Thirdly, the use of artiﬁcial intelligence approaches in identiﬁcation of new/emerging skills, which are not included in taxonomies, is another research area that requires more investment and knowledge building. The ongoing research tendered by Cedefop/Eurostat may bring some more understanding to this discussion, but other possibilities should also be explored, e.g. identifying gaps by merging taxonomy terms with the information extracted from academic journals [see Chiarello et al. (2021)]. Furthermore, the researchers using results of online data analysis to inform policy makers to be transparent about the potential biases should also include an explanatory methodological note on the representativeness of their data. The AI-based approaches to correct representation error in the online data are also a developing ﬁeld in the researchers’ discussions [see Beresewicz et al. (2021)]. Lastly, the various recommendation tools that appear on the market to offer help to job seekers are based on the similarities or overlap between skills of two occupations, and these similarities are very often calculated with use of similar techniques to classifying unstructured text with existing taxonomies [see Amdur et al. (2016) and Domeniconi et al. (2016)]. It would be worth researching and evaluating the quality of existing solutions and the suggested transitions offered to job seekers, especially that some recommendation tools do not account for hierarchical structure of skills or duration of learning time.

Chapter 14 Computational Climate Change: How Data Science and Numerical Models Can Help Build Good Climate Policies and Practices Massimo Tavoni Abstract Computational social science can help advance climate policy and help solve the climate crises. To do so, several steps need to be overcome to make the best use of the wealth of data and variety of models available to evaluate climate change policies. Here, we review the state of the art of numerical modelling and data science methods applied to policy evaluation. We emphasize that signiﬁcant progress has been made but that critical social and economic phenomena—especially related to climate justice—are not yet fully captured and thus limit the predictivity and usefulness of computational approaches. We posit that the integration of statistical and numerical approaches is key to developing a new impact evaluation science that overcomes the traditional divide between ex ante and ex post approaches. 14.1 Introduction Climate change is one of the deﬁning societal and policy issues of our time. As climate impacts are already felt in societies and economies, governments around the world are mobilizing enormous resources to help reduce greenhouse gases and to adapt to climate impacts. Given the complexity of the mitigation and adaptation strategies, which involve a variety of different constituencies and span a broad technology spectrum, advanced research methods can help guide policies to be most effective, efﬁcient, and inclusive. Computational social science has already made signiﬁcant contributions to climate policy evaluation and climate impact research. This is an area of high inter- disciplinarity that combines climate physical information with data representing human systems. Broadly speaking, methodologies have focused on either retro- M.

Tavoni spective or prospective assessments, though mixed approaches have also emerged. Retrospective, ex-post analysis has focused on evaluating the impact of climate policies and global warming on a variety of social and economic outcomes, such as economic productivity, inequality, labour market participation, social acceptance, etc. This strand of research has employed a variety of statistical approaches such as econometrics and machine learning to data either historically observed or purposefully generated (e.g. via surveys, or experimental trials). Prospective, ex ante approaches have tackled the issue of projecting the consequences of climate change and climate strategies into the future, often far distant ones given the inertia in the climate and economic systems. Here, methodologies have focused on numerical approaches such as optimization and simulation models, often integrating different components of the human and climate systems. Prominent examples include integrated assessment models (IAMs), energy system models, computable general equilibrium models, and agent-based models. Both approaches have had a signiﬁcant policy inﬂuence in Europe and elsewhere. The increased empirical recognition of the social and economic risks of climate change has helped to make climate a policy priority. Ex-post policy evaluation has helped improve our understanding of the functioning of public interventions and to improve them. Future scenarios of emissions and the energy and economy transformations compatible with decarbonization have had a major inﬂuence in determining the outcomes of international climate negotiations such as the Paris Agreement and informing society of the possible course of actions via international panels such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This chapter provides a succinct review of the role played by both statistical and numerical methods in climate change mitigation and adaptation research. It then discussed the policy implications of the research done so far on speciﬁc policy- relevant issues. Finally, it maps possible evolutions and future contributions of computational social sciences to help the impending ﬁght against climate change. 14.2 Modelling the Climate Economy 14.2.1 Model Paradigms Understanding the complex relationship between climate change, social and eco- nomic factors, and the needed transition in the emitting sectors such as agricul- ture and energy cannot be done without complex tools. Indeed, computational approaches have become the dominant paradigm for generating scenarios of future climate and of climate-resilient strategies. One class of models that is prominent in this ﬁeld goes under the name of IAMs. As evident from the title, integrated assessment modelling is a general term that captures a variety of paradigms, often of a very different nature. 14 Computational Climate Change: How Data Science and Numerical Models... 263 A general distinction has been made between beneﬁt-cost and detailed process models (Weyant, 2017). Both model paradigms include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, compute their climate consequences, and feature technologies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. They have been used for decades to inform the design of climate policies. However, they have some fundamental differences which have set them apart, despite often being equated. Beneﬁt-cost models have a relatively aggregated representation of the mitigation component but include the feedback of climate change on the economic system. The closed-loop formulation allows doing what the name suggests: to compute costs and beneﬁts of climate action and to opti- mize the trade-off between the two, suggesting courses of action which are therefore economically optimal. This class of models originates from economists’ role in early climate debates, such as the US National Academy of Science climate committee established in the early 1980s which included two future Nobel prize winners in economics, Tom Schelling and William Nordhaus. Nordhaus developed back then what has become a standard beneﬁt-cost model, the DICE model (Nordhaus, 1994, 2008; Nordhaus & Boyer, 2000), for which he eventually won the prestigious award in 2018. DICE is a dynamic, non-linear optimization model based on the optimal growth framework of Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans, coupled with a simpliﬁed climate model and a very simple representation of emission reduction technologies. Despite the simplicity and reliance on standard, neo-classical approaches, the model has been used extensively by many scholars in different ﬁelds, thus becoming a classic still in use today even in regulatory work. Other beneﬁt-cost IAMs are FUND (Tol 1997, www.fund-model.org) and PAGE (Hope, 2006). In parallel to the development of beneﬁt-cost models, a different approach emerged. This built on the work done in the 1970s to model energy systems in response to the oil price shocks, for example, by the Energy Modeling Forum, as well as by the establishment in the late 1980s of the IPCC. By the early 1990s, several detailed process models had been developed, and even a model comparison project on the economic costs of climate control was completed (Gaskins & Weyant, 1993), at the same time when structured model comparisons emerged in climate science (Smith et al., 2015). Disaggregated process-based models represent the underlying processes more explicitly than aggregate models: for example, mitigation technologies are represented in much greater detail, the climate components are based on intermediate complexity models calibrated upon large-scale climate models, and the economic sectors might be represented at higher granularity. This class of models includes simulation and optimization approaches but tends to focus on the evaluation of policies such as emission reduction ones rather than ﬁnding the optimal climate conditions for the economy. Over time, dozens of such models have been developed, whether global tools for understanding international climate policies such as the ones envisioned in the Paris Agreement or national or subnational tools to simulate local policies. An association has been established 14 years ago with the purpose of (Emmerling & Tavoni, 2021; Gambhir 264 M. Tavoni et al., 2019;Weyant, 2017) creating a community of scholars and practitioners focused on integrated modelling for climate change.1 In addition to these two broad classes of integrated assessment models, additional numerical approaches have been developed over the years. A large number of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models are now available, though not always classiﬁed as IAMs (Parrado, 2010;Rausch et al., 2011). These models, alongside dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) ones, have a detailed representation of economic sectors and of their interaction. They are used for policy evaluation and not optimization, thus belonging to the detailed process category. For example, the European Commission regularly employs a CGE and a DSGE for the impact assessment of its policy proposals, including the ambitious Fit-for-55 policy package. Model paradigms that do not enforce equilibrium are also available and also used for policy appraisal. These include macro-econometric approaches as well as agent-based models applied to climate change (Keppo et al., 2021;Lamperti et al., 2018;Ma & Nakamori, 2009). 14.2.2 Modelling Relevance for Climate Policy It is hard to underestimate the contribution of computational models to the climate change policy debate, whether it is about policy impact assessment or international negotiations. The reliance of scientiﬁc bodies such as the IPCC on model-generated scenarios and numbers is clear evidence of this process: from the less than 200 scenarios in the 4th assessment report of the IPCC, scenarios have grown to well over 1000 in most recent ones. The Paris Agreement agreed upon in 2015 was, for example, heavily inﬂuenced by the ﬁfth assessment report and in particular by the results of integrated assessment models which simulated the implications of stabilizing temperature below 2 ◦C. The climate neutrality pledges recently announced by several major economies can be partly attributed to a sentence in the IPCC 1.5 special report which is the outcome of model-based evaluations: ‘In model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5◦C, global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40–60% interquartile range), reaching net zero around 2050 (2045–2055 interquartile range)’. Models have not just provided the timing of climate neutrality, which has become such a focal point for international climate policies. They have also depicted transformation pathways for the economic, energy, and land systems compatible with climate stabilization: most of the scenario work has indeed focused on cost- effective pathways meeting given climate targets. These constraints have been taken as given by policy, including temperature targets but progressively carbon budgets, which have emerged as a reliable climate metric from the climate science 1 https://www.iamconsortium.org/ 14 Computational Climate Change: How Data Science and Numerical Models... 265 community (Allen et al., 2009). The integration of process-based models with climate science speaks of the multidisciplinary nature of mathematical modelling. Models have also laid out different technological and behavioural pathways to net-zero emissions: though in all climate stabilization scenarios fossil fuels are phased out quite rapidly and replaced by renewable sources and energy demand measures, the combination of different technologies and behavioural changes can change substantially across pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement. For example, the same temperature goal can be achieved with different usage of CO2 removal strategies. Although all scenarios compatible with 1.5 ◦Cenvisage some negative emission technologies, the timing and extent of removals vary across models and scenarios and have been the subject of intense academic debate (Fuss et al., 2014; Tavoni & Socolow, 2013). The extent of CO2 removals is driven as much by techno-economic assumptions made in the models about the technologies as by normative hypothesis and scenario design. For example, the choice of the intertemporal discount rate is a well-known key parameter in integrated assessment modelling but mostly for beneﬁt-cost optimization rather than cost-effective analysis of a given temperature target. The introduction into IAMs of negative emission strategies, however, has made this normative assumption relevant also for cost- effectiveness: by sharing the burden towards future generations, scenarios with high discount rates are characterized by a higher reliance on CO2 removals (Emmerling et al., 2019). This example shows how normative judgments, often implicit in model formulations, matter for climate change (Saltelli et al., 2020). The consequences of these choices matter not just for academic purposes but also for policy design: the extent and need of negative emission technologies are now discussed in international policy such as in the revision of the Nationally Determined Contributions, as well as in national policies such as the EU Green Deal where a separate accounting of removals from standard emission reductions and their management into the Emission Trading Scheme is now debated (Rickels et al., 2021). Computational impact assessments have also examined the social and economic consequences of climate policies. For example, the European Commission leg- islative proposals—including the Fit-for-55 and the mid-century strategies—have been vetted by a series of climate-energy-economy models, which have computed the repercussions for economic activity, employment, and other social dimensions. Table 14.1 (EC, ‘Policy scenarios for delivering the European Green Deal’) reports the latest estimates for the increased emission reduction ambition recently announced by the European Commission for the GDP of Europe, as computed by three climate-energy-economy models (JRC-GEM-E3, E3ME, and E-QUEST). Although all models tend to agree on relatively small macroeconomic impacts of decarbonizing the European economy, it is worth noting that different models produce estimates of different signs, as well as that the results will depend on the details of the policy formulation. For example, the GEM-E3 model of the JRC suggests that the economy will slightly contract, whereas the E3ME by Cambridge Econometrics foresees a policy-induced economic expansion. The reason for this discrepancy is the underlying economic framework assumed in each model: GEM- E3 is a computational general equilibrium model which embeds assumptions about 266 M.

E3ME is a macro-econometric model which does not assume optimizing behaviour and full utilization of resources but is rather based on a simulation approach based on economic accounting matrices and histori- cal relations which include, for example, voluntary and involuntary unemployment. E-QUEST is a micro-founded dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. The choice of the European Commission to employ three models of different nature highlights the fact that when it comes to economic and social repercussions, the model paradigm choice is essential and it is hard to discriminate between good and bad models, contrary to physical models such as Global Circulation Models. Importantly for policy evaluation, different models can simulate different policy provisions: Table 14.1 shows just how relevant is the type of policies which will be implemented, for example, how carbon tax revenues will be used. If economic policy consequences are hard to predict, social impacts are even more complicated and yet increasingly important in the objective of achieving a just transition. Economic and social inequalities, for example, are a major driver of policy acceptance and a crucial policy objective. Traditionally, integrated assessment models have not focused on inequality (Emmerling & Tavoni, 2021): however, this has now become a policy focus, and new work to expand models in order to address this request is ongoing (Gazzotti et al., 2021). The use of computational models for understanding behavioural responses has proven more difﬁcult. As a result, models have prioritized technological, supply-side solutions over demand-side ones (Creutzig et al., 2018). This is because of the difﬁculties of portraying human behaviour into tractable mathematical formulations, and the traditional paucity of empirical evidence on how households respond to economic and behavioural interventions. As we will discuss later on, the empirical evidence 14 Computational Climate Change: How Data Science and Numerical Models... 267 has accumulated in recent years thanks to more robust statistical approaches and data with higher resolutions. This has opened up the possibility of using models, such as agent-based models, to better capture the behavioural responses to climate policies. Even standard integrated assessment models have developed and can now account for lifestyle changes necessary to achieve the low carbon transformation (van den Berg et al., 2019). Besides climate mitigation policies, computational models have been used to compute the impacts of climate change and to design adaptation strategies. One policy-relevant application of IAMs, for example, has been to compute the social cost of carbon (SCC)—the monetized damages associated with an incremental increase in carbon emissions. The SCC is used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of climate policies in the USA and has been traditionally computed using three beneﬁt-cost IAMs. The economic valuation of climate impacts is important also in climate negotiations on the discussion of loss and damages. One major driving factor in the wide range of estimates of the SCC is the formulation and parametrization of the damage functions. The damage function originally used in simple beneﬁt- cost models such as DICE has been criticized for lack of empirical basis and for recommending insufﬁcient climate ambition (or equivalently for producing too low SCC). This highlights the importance of better integration of empirical and modelling approaches, a point on which we will return further in the chapter. One area where computational models have indirectly contributed to policy assessment, both for mitigation and adaptation, is the generation of counterfactual emission scenarios. Evaluating policies ex ante requires ﬁrst deﬁning a world in which those policies are absent, as a reference over which to calculate the policy repercussions. This is a notoriously difﬁcult task, given the uncertainties of predict- ing future outcomes but also the challenges of deﬁning which trends and policies to include. For global climate issues, the workhorse of counterfactual emission scenarios is that of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways [SSPs (Riahi et al., 2017)]. The SSPs depict ﬁve possible scenarios of the future, with different demographic, economic, and technological trajectories, and consequent challenges for climate mitigation and adaptation challenges (O’Neill et al., 2013). The narratives span dif- ferent evolutions of prosperity, inequality, and environmental degradation: they are characterized by both quantitative elements, such as population and GDP growth, and qualitative elements such as technological narratives. The SSPs have been simulated by ﬁve IAMs, which have produced the resulting emission trajectories, and consequent climate outcomes. These have been used by several other scientiﬁc communities, most notably the climate science and climate impact ones. They also have had policy repercussions, for example, on the social cost of carbon. 268 M. Tavoni 14.2.3 Challenges in Using Integrated Assessment Models to Inform Societal Change So far, we have highlighted the growing relevance of computational mathematical models for the prospective evaluation of climate policies. Climate strategies’ repercussions for societies, households, and businesses are now routinely quantiﬁed using numerical models. Although this speaks of the growing importance of computational sciences in the climate domain, the increased reliance on structured approaches has not come without problems. For example, quantitative approaches have been condemned for exploring only a narrow set of possible futures and not keeping track of the rapid evolution of the climate technology and policy context. Most models implicitly represent value judgments and social preference and have been criticized for not exploring these normative assumptions, which are also plagued by uncertainties (MacAskill, 2016). The modelling community has responded in various ways to the challenges of underplaying or not representing the full range of uncertainties. For example, global sensitivity analysis (Razavi et al., 2021) is a well-proven approach to ensure model-generated results are robust. It has been used in the context of large-scale climate-energy models only to a limited extent (Butler et al., 2014; Marangoni et al., 2017). An additional strategy to deal with model uncertainty has been a coordinated community response based on multi-model ensembles. Multi-model ensembles provide a range of plausible outcomes from a set of harmonized assumptions (i.e. given carbon budgets or temperature targets, still within this century). The ensemble spread is typically used to quantify model uncertainty. Although this process appears unambiguous, it can deceptively be so, since it is based on the assumption that models constitute independent estimates (Abramowitz et al., 2019; Merriﬁeld et al., 2020). Selection and availability biases determine the typology and number of models involved in the comparison project and model dependencies inherent in the community work. Uncertainty is inﬂuenced by choices made in the model compar- ison project construction (Knutti et al., 2010). For example, ensemble members are not independent: they have historically shared code, use similar parametrization, and—an issue that is especially important for models examining socio-techno- economic transitions—belong to similar paradigms. The implicit normativity of climate-energy-economy models further contributes to compounding the sources of uncertainties and model relations. The challenges in formulating policy recommendation from a vast number of scenarios and models, which often disagree, have led the policy community to often embrace simpler approaches based on few, representative scenarios. This, for example, has become the standard approach of IPCC in presenting its scenario space in an accessible way. International organizations, such as the International Energy Agency, typically present very few scenarios that become standard ones. However, the problem of the plausibility of scenarios and of the associated uncertainties is not solved by reducing the scenario space arbitrarily, unless statistical valid approaches are employed, which is typically not the case. This has important policy 14 Computational Climate Change: How Data Science and Numerical Models... 269 ramiﬁcations: for example, impact studies typically take the SSP5-RCP8.5 as a benchmark scenario, despite this being a relatively extreme one which was judged as a low probability by the scenario community itself (Ho et al., 2019). Advancements in statistical approaches and in behavioural science can be used towards not only more robust empirical evidence of policy effectiveness but also to make scenarios credible and insightful, something we turn to in the next section. 14.3 Data Science for Climate Impacts and Policy The contribution of computational social sciences to climate change is not limited to numerical modelling. Actually, some of the most important contributions of the literature with direct or indirect policy repercussions have come from empirical and statistical approaches. 14.3.1 Data-Driven Approaches for Climate Economics The fact that climate change has been changing, in addition to the natural and large variability in weather patterns, and the fact that climate and energy policies have been slowly but gradually deployed have provided previous information to scholars interested in the causal relationship between climate and its solutions and high-stakes social and economic issues. The growth of observations not just on climate outcomes but also on social and economic ones at high spatial resolution has provided sufﬁcient statistical power to conduct innovative empirical research. Several approaches have been used to infer causal climate-socio-economic linkages. Panel data econometrics, for example, has been applied to understand the impacts of climate change on a large set of outcomes, as discussed below. Other econometric approaches such as difference in difference, matching, and regression discontinuity designs have been used to infer causal relationships in the absence of an exogenous variation to be exploited. Standard regression approaches have been used where counterfactual randomization was ensured, such as in randomized controlled trials. Finally, machine learning methods are increasingly used to understand and promote sustainable policies: for example, machine learning has been applied to satellite imagery, whose increased abundance and resolution can provide crucial information on sustainability in areas of the world where data is scarce (Burke et al., 2020) and where climate change impacts are also more likely to occur. Novel algorithms have also been used to better understand energy usage patterns, for example, in the residential and transportation sectors where high-frequency information is now available, and to study policies to motivate behavioural and technological changes towards a greener society. 270 M. Tavoni 14.3.2 Relevance of Empirical Methods for Climate Policy Empirical methods are key for understanding policy effectiveness and environmen- tal social and economic disruptions. They are also needed in order to calibrate prospective impact assessments. Over the past few years, empirical studies have greatly advanced the understanding of climate change impacts and of the policies meant to address them. One major area has been in the quantiﬁcation of climate social and economic impacts. Traditionally, the climate impact functions used in beneﬁt-cost analysis and for the social cost of carbon were based on prospective studies which raised issues of replicability and transparency. Over the course of the past 10 years, a wealth of data-driven approaches have highlighted the relationship between historical weather variability and many outcomes (Carleton & Hsiang, 2016). For example, temperature heat induces mortality and has been connected to aggression and violence. Agriculture and crop yields are related to temperature in a strongly non- linear way, with yields dropping when temperature exceeds certain thresholds. This non-linear relationship has been documented also for energy demand (Auffhammer et al., 2017), with peak demand rising when temperatures are high. On the economic side, temperature variability has been associated with signiﬁ- cant macroeconomic repercussions. The identiﬁcation of a non-linear relationship between temperature and economic growth has highlighted how climate impacts can persistently slow economic progress (Burke et al., 2015; Delletal., 2012; Kalkuhl & Wenz, 2020). This view is in stark contrast to the previously assumed relations which were based on the levels and not the growth of the economy. The consequences of this new empirical evidence have been particularly prominent in the beneﬁt-cost assessments of climate policies and in the calculations of the social cost of carbon. Once the empirically derived damage functions were plugged into the IAMs, the recommendations for policy stringency changed dramatically, and for the ﬁrst time, it appeared that stabilizing climate change within the goals of the Paris Agreement made global economic sense (Gazzotti et al., 2021; Glanemann et al., 2020;Hänsel et al., 2020). Similarly, the social cost of carbon—a policy-relevant metric for setting policy in the USA—increased substantially over previously available estimates (Ricke et al., 2018). The data science advanced on the economics of climate change impact also highlighted the major economic inequalities brought about by climate change. These economic inequalities are detectable already today (Diffenbaugh & Burke, 2019) and are forecasted to persist even in case of ambitious emission reductions, and even more in the absence of cooperation, as shown in Fig. 14.1. Although the extent of persistency of climate economic impacts is a subject of intense academic debate (Piontek et al., 2021), the accumulated evidence has shown the importance of reducing emissions as fast as possible, preparing adaptation systems, and considering additional climate interventions such as CO2 removals, to avoid temperature overshoots and consequent social and economic repercussions. 14 Computational Climate Change: How Data Science and Numerical Models... 271Fig.14.1GDPpercapita,netofcostsandimpacts,population-weighteddistributionin2100forthreeclimatescenarios(BAUwithoutclimateimpacts,globalcooperationandnoncooperation).FromGazzottietal.(2021) 272 M. Tavoni Another area of data-driven research which has important ramiﬁcations for policy design is that of behavioural science and of the experimental economics literature quantifying traditional and behavioural interventions. Behavioural sciences have consistently shown how human behaviour is fraught by biases, but also that several of these can be predicted, and thus partly addressed (Ariely, 2010). Many governments around the world have promoted the use of behavioural informed public policies, including but going beyond the use of ‘nudges’ (Banerjee et al., 2021). Methodologically, disentangling the impact of policy interventions, including behavioural ones, on outcome variables is difﬁcult. Confounding factors such as exogenous trends (e.g. in energy prices, preferences, etc.) and self-selection (e.g. environmentally sensitive households more likely to enrol in pro-environmental programmes) have traditionally made it difﬁcult to quantify the causal impact of policies. However, the embracing of statistical approaches based on counterfactual randomization, such as laboratory, online, and ﬁeld experiments, has opened up the possibility to test for causality of policy interventions. Randomized controlled trials have been now done on millions of households and have helped evaluate a variety of interventions, such as information provision, message framing, social comparisons, monetary, and symbolic incentives (Allcott, 2011; Allcott & Mullainathan, 2010; Bonan et al., 2020, 2021; Ferraro & Price, 2013; Fowlie et al., 2015). These inter- ventions have been assessed using reliable metrics of energy usage (and consequent GHG emissions) such as actual metered electricity consumption, thus providing a reliable line of evidence. The main results of this stream of computational social science have shown that behavioural interventions, if properly designed and implemented, can lead to small but signiﬁcant energy and emission reductions. However, their effectiveness is context-dependent and varies signiﬁcantly across population subgroups. As such, these policy instruments should complement but not substitute traditional interventions, including infrastructural and incentive-based ones. The potential of data science to inform climate policymaking is enormous, but it has not yet realized its full capacity and should anticipate possible critiques which might emerge in the future. In terms of potential applications, data-driven approaches can help inform local decisions and design climate-resilient infrastruc- tures at the local level. Cities are places that abound both in data and emissions, and where well-designed infrastructural policies can promote lifestyles that are both sustainable and inclusive (Creutzig et al., 2018). Data can be used to transform mobility services and reduce congestion and pollution. Some local institutions have already begun using high-resolution data for public purposes related to sustainable planning, but only limited potential has concretized. One concern with such an extension of data-driven urban policies regards the question of data equity and privacy. The way data is handled when it comes to policymaking is as crucial as the actual policies which will derive from it: data availability is often skewed towards certain sociodemographic areas and population subgroups, and resulting policies need to ensure to go beyond pre-existing social arrangements. Furthermore, the question of privacy which has become a central element of regulatory design needs to be accounted for when relying on data-driven impact evaluation. 14 Computational Climate Change: How Data Science and Numerical Models... 273 14.4 Towards an Integrated Computational Approach Overall, we have highlighted that computational approaches—both model-based and data-driven—have played an increasingly important role in climate change poli- cies, both for mitigation and adaptation. Computational approaches have become ubiquitous, and policymaking is now heavily dependent on them, whether it is for determining the impacts of proposed legislation or of already implemented one. However, in order to serve society well, mathematical and statistical modelling should be accompanied by an epistemic strengthening of the underlying theoretical basis, empirical validity, and scientiﬁc practices (Saltelli et al., 2020). One focus area for climate-purposed computational approaches is that of inte- grating data and model-driven approaches. Traditionally, these two approaches have been used to look at retrospective and prospective policy assessment, respectively. This rigid division of labour needs to be overcome if we want to have policy appraisal which can be learned from actual experiences: the growing number of energy and climate policies being tested in real-world conditions can now provide important information for calibrating models and made them more policy- relevant. Furthermore, the growing availability of high-resolution data such as those from satellite imagery, social media, and high-frequency metered energy and environmental indicators can be harnessed to understand behavioural policy responses at a high level of granularity. Machine learning approaches can then be combined with model inputs and output to increase the understanding of the model-embedded processes and to better predict policy responses. Finally, model validation and adequate exploration of the uncertainties should become scientiﬁc practices fully integrated in mathematical modelling. Computational approaches to do that effectively are now available, and their properties are well known (Razavi et al., 2021), and yet they are often not done (Saltelli et al., 2019). This speaks of the importance of a tighter and regulated relationship between researchers and policymakers, with clear guidance from policy evaluation agencies on scientiﬁc practices and robust methodological approaches. If crafted properly in a coordinated and co-designed manner, computational social science can be of tremendous value to climate policy-making and help accelerate the climate transition and ensure it is carried out in a just and inclusive way.

Chapter 15 Digital Epidemiology Yelena Mejova Abstract Computational social science has had a profound impact on the study of health and disease, mainly by providing new data sources for all of the primary Ws—what, who, when, and where—in order to understand the ﬁnal “why” of dis- ease. Anonymized digital trace data bring a new level of detail to contact networks, search engine and social media logs allow for the now-casting of symptoms and behaviours, and media sharing informs the formation of attitudes pivotal in health decision-making. Advances in computational methods in network analysis, agent- based modelling, as well as natural language processing, data mining, and time series analysis allow both the extraction of ﬁne-grained insights and the construction of abstractions over the new data sources. Meanwhile, numerous challenges around bias, privacy, and ethics are being negotiated between data providers, academia, the public, and policymakers in order to ensure the legitimacy of the resulting insights and their responsible incorporation into the public health decision-making. This chapter outlines the latest research on the application of computational social science to epidemiology and the data sources and computational methods involved and spotlights ongoing efforts to address the challenges in its integration into policymaking. 15.1 Introduction From the beginnings of epidemiology, the importance of data has been central. Often considered fathers of the ﬁeld, John Graunt analysed London’s bills of mortality to measure the mortality of certain diseases in 1663, and later in 1854, John Snow mapped the cholera cases to identify its sources. Although since those early days in London the medical and mathematical understanding of disease have greatly advanced, one of the primary roles of the epidemiologist is still to prepare and Y.

Mejova organize the collection of relevant and useful data and to use it to model disease (Obi et al., 2020). This data includes the fundamental Ws that are necessary to understand disease: health event (what), people involved (who), place (where), time (when), and causes, risk factors, and modes of transmission (why/how) (Dicker et al., 2006). Thus, some of the main tasks of an epidemiologist are disease surveillance, ﬁeld investigation, contact tracing, evaluation of interventions, and public communication—all of which have been transformed by the digital and computing revolutions. Scientiﬁcally, the ﬁeld is highly multidisciplinary, ﬁrst measuring the basics of the Ws—identifying the people, places, and time frames of the health events— and then introducing higher-order considerations, the biology of disease, behaviour of its carriers, and ecological inﬂuences on the transmission. By building models around this knowledge, it attempts to recommend possible interventions, which then require additional measurement and modelling of complex feedback effects and the psychological and behavioural factors. Advances in disparate ﬁelds like genetics, behavioural economics, and ecology on the one hand and more recent strides in computing methods and digitization on the other are making it possible for epidemiology to develop a systems conceptualization of the ﬁelds it connects. Computational social science (CSS) in particular adds new tools via large-scale detection, tracking, and contextualizing of disease. As we will see below, digital traces such as mobility and cellphone data have been used to better understand human networks, user-generated content on social media and the web has been employed to now-cast symptoms and disease, and social interactions have been monitored to understand the impact of social contact and new information on health- related behaviour change. Capturing the latest modelling and computing techniques, the umbrella terms of digital or computational epidemiology encompass these new methodological developments. A string of epidemics in the early twenty-ﬁrst century—H1N1 (swine ﬂu) in 2009, Ebola in 2014 and 2019, and Zika in 2016—has brought epidemiology to the forefront of public awareness, culminating in the COVID-19 pandemic (at the time of this writing, in any case). Meanwhile, public health policy and interventions are being increasingly informed by telecommunications and other digital data (Budd et al., 2020; Oliver et al., 2020;Rich & Miah, 2017). Governments are collab- orating with major cellphone companies to perform privacy-preserving contact tracing, internet companies are releasing aggregated mobility data for contagion modelling, and social media giants are partnering with public health organizations to tackle health misinformation and to support public health messaging campaigns. Throughout, a constant negotiation is at play between the needs of public health researchers and the release of commercially valuable information by the companies. Moreover, a less publicized, but nevertheless critical, battle is being waged against non-communicable diseases including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and mental health disorders. Daily digital traces, such as social media posts and location check-ins, are being used to understand the lifestyle choices of large cohorts, as an alternative to surveys and diaries. Discussions around mental health, disordered eating, illicit drugs, and other topics that are difﬁcult to capture using traditional 15 Digital Epidemiology 281 surveillance methods are now presenting a window into vulnerable populations, even before they register in medical records. Despite the great promise of new data sources and methodologies, big data approaches are a subject to a slew of challenges that the ﬁeld needs to overcome in order to establish fruitful collaboration with policymakers. Although big, the datasets often present biased view of the population, which is more tech-savvy and afﬂuent, while excluding those who may have a more urgent need of monitoring and assistance. However, integration of this new data into existing datasets allows for the reduction of overall bias and helps in extending analyses performed on traditional data sources. Encompassing many disciplines who have their own organization, research frameworks, peculiar jargon, and publication venues, digital epidemiology is still in the processing of bridging the siloes to encourage truly multidisciplinary insight. Standardizing the reporting and transparency among these disciplines aims to reduce the number of isolated studies which may suffer from the lack of reproducibility due to the peculiar nature of the available data, application domain, or poorly documented methodology. The legal and ethical standards of using digital data are still being decided through a dialogue between data owners, public health researchers, academics in various disciplines, and representatives of the users of the digital platforms. Thus, the ﬁeld is still building the structures of cooperation, trust, and legitimacy that are necessary to provide impactful insights for policymakers. Nevertheless, COVID-19 has accelerated the integration of digital epidemiology into its decision-making process. Below, we outline the major accomplishments in the application of computational social science to epidemiology, the accompanying challenges, and the possible ways forward to greater legitimacy and impact. 15.2 Existing Literature The explosion in the utilization of computational methods for epidemiology has been spurred by the combination of new computational techniques and the availabil- ity of new sources of data. The immense volume of available data has encouraged further development and integration into the scientiﬁc toolkit of distributed comput- ing frameworks, as well as data-intense deep learning algorithms, with frameworks such as Apache Spark and TensorFlow that allow the ingestion and processing of terabytes of data (Kleppmann, 2017; Weidman, 2019). The rise of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) business model from giants of industry including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and cloud services from Oracle, Google, and IBM has allowed the researchers to access sophisticated infrastructure without purchasing the hardware and support staff within their institutions (on a similar topic, see also Fontana & Guerzoni, 2023). Much of the data that has accompanied these developments in the computing ﬁeld has been put to use by epidemiologists, opening new scientiﬁc ground. The ongoing digitization of medical records, insurance claims, and governmental public health data continues to provide large-scale, high-quality view of individuals within 282 Y. Mejova the medical system. Ongoing efforts, such as the European Health Data Space,1 aggregate such datasets, handle privacy concerns, and make it available for research and policymaking (European Commission., 2021). Moreover, the communication revolution has enabled researchers to better understand these individuals even before they enter the public health system. Digital traces of people’s daily activities, including the apps they use, web searches they make, social media posts they publish, as well as the signals from the wearables they keep on their bodies, can help create a view of health-related activities with an unprecedented resolution and reach. One of the earliest attempts to track inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) using user-generated data was proposed by a team of Google researchers who tracked the occurrence of speciﬁc keywords in the company’s search query logs (Ginsberg et al., 2009). Although highly criticized by subsequent researchers (Lazer et al., 2014) (we will discuss these concerns below), research on web logs continues to produce encouraging results, including detecting adverse reactions (Yom-Tov &Lev-Ran, 2017), predicting diagnosis of diabetes (Hochberg et al., 2019), and understanding the information needs around medical topics (Rosenblum & Yom- Tov, 2017). Specialized application use has been used to understand the effects of gamiﬁcation (Althoff et al., 2016) and social contagion (Aral & Nicolaides, 2017) on exercise and the characteristics of (un-)successful diets (Weber & Achananuparp, 2016). The text posted by thousands of users on social media platforms has been used to identify and track depression (De Choudhury et al., 2013), eating disorders (Stewart et al., 2017), attitudes toward vaccination (Cossard et al., 2020), and other health interventions. The networked nature of the data often allows the study of the way in which information (Johnson et al., 2020), behaviours, and diseases propagate. Finally, anonymized mobility data, often coming from telephone and transportation companies, has allowed a more ﬁne-grained transmission modelling of the disease (Vespe et al., 2021), as well as the impact of mobility-related interventions (Jeffrey et al., 2020). These data sources add immense value to the traditional ones by increasing the population coverage (some into millions of people), temporal resolution (allowing “now-casting”), and qualitative depth that are impossible or prohibitively expensive to reach outside the digital domain. One of the earliest examples of the application of computational models to infectious diseases was human inﬂuenza, which is an ongoing public health battle. It is continuously analysed via viral phylodynamics in order to better understand its transmission dynamics. Computational phylogenetics methods are applied to datasets of genetic sequences sampled over time and sub-populations in order to assemble a phylogenetic tree and estimate various dynamics of the process (Volz et al., 2013). Fitness models also help in selecting the vaccines year over year (Łuksza & Lässig, 2014). Beyond the study of the virus itself, CSS has introduced several behavioural aspects to the models, many of which have been used during the COVID-19 epidemic. Mobility data (including that provided publicly by large corporations during the pandemic) has been used to monitor the compliance with 1 https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space_en 15 Digital Epidemiology 283 interventions, such as the stay-at-home orders during COVID-19, revealing the role of awareness and fatigue in modelling risky behaviours (Weitz et al., 2020). Large- scale online surveys and crowdsourcing have been used to gauge psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic around the world (Yamada et al., 2021). Even larger efforts, such as InﬂuenzaNet, recruit thousands of volunteers across Europe to regularly report ILI symptoms, allowing researchers to identify risk factors and gauge inﬂuenza vaccine effectiveness (Koppeschaar et al., 2017). Travel records have been used to track the international transmission of disease (Azad & Devi, 2020), whereas a machine-learned anonymized smartphone mobility map has been used to forecast inﬂuenza within and across countries (Venkatramanan et al., 2021). For instance, the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) framework uses local and international mobility data to build epidemic models, allowing for the simulation of worldwide pandemics, including estimating the impact of interventions during the COVID-19 epidemic (Chinazzi et al., 2020; Van den Broeck et al., 2011). To better understand the reasons behind risky behaviours and non-compliance with public health advice, researchers utilized discussions on social media, often ﬁnding misunderstandings and downright misinformation (Betti et al., 2021; Keller et al., 2021). Finally, public health communication campaigns have been evaluated using outreach online by inﬂuencers (Bonnevie et al., 2020)aswell as newswebsites and popular social media sites (Carlson et al., 2020). Unlike in the beginning of epidemiology’s development as a science, the infec- tious diseases have these days given way to non-communicable diseases as the cause of illness and death, especially in the developed countries. The daily behaviours captured in digital trace data, especially social media, have been extensively used to study non-communicable diseases including obesity and diabetes type 2, mental illness, and even suicide. At population level, diabetes has been tracked using store purchase data (Aiello et al., 2019), as well as social media posts (Abbar et al., 2015), and some environmental causes have been tracked in the USA, with a focus on “food deserts” where access to healthy food is limited (De Choudhury, Sharma, et al., 2016). Attempts to inform potential interventions have been made by measuring the importance of community support during a weight loss journey (Cunha et al., 2016) and the effect of intervention messaging on those affected by anorexia (Yom-Tov et al., 2012). Observational studies of exercise in particular through specialized exercise applications have shown that information about other people’s routine may affect one’s own (Aral & Nicolaides, 2017) and that gender plays an important role in the continued use of such apps (Mejova & Kalimeri, 2019). Further, a combination of web search and wearables data has been used to show the health impact of applications not necessarily meant for exercise, such as Pokémon Go, which resulted in potentially years worth of life spans added to the fans of the game (Althoff et al., 2016). The anonymous and connected nature of social media and specialized forums have also allowed a better understanding of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and other mental health issues (for an overview, see Chancellor & De Choudhury, 2020). The text of the posts has been used to predict suicidal ideation (Cheng et al., 2017), psychotic relapses (Birnbaum et al., 2019), and PTSD (Coppersmith et al., 2014). More specialized data sources 284 Y. Mejova have been used to track recreational drug use (Deluca et al., 2012), as well as the use of “dark web” as a marketplace for such activities (Aldridge & Décary-Hétu, 2016). In combination with screening questionnaires which use validated scales such as Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the daily self-expressions of those dealing with mental health issues provide an unintrusive record of the condition’s progression and reactions to potential interventions. These encouraging developments have been accompanied by a vigorous discus- sion of their limitations. The privacy concerns regarding secondary use of personal data, even if originally posted on public platforms, demand a critical evaluation of the balance between potential beneﬁts of public health research, compared to the privacy risks to the individuals captured in the data (see, e.g. Taylor, 2023). Other critiques are more unique to the ﬁeld of epidemiology. For instance, the machine learning framework of classiﬁcation, as well as most deterministic compartmental models (such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR), more on which later), makes necessary simplifying assumptions about the natural progression of a disease, its behaviour, as well as the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions introduced to slow its spread, although more sophisticated models with more complex representations are continuously being proposed. The separation between traditional epidemiology and computing disciplines in the research teams often results in the failure to take into consideration the estab- lished theories in clinical science, using operationalization that is most convenient technically, but not as well matched to the medical condition tracked, while a vague communication of the technical aspects of computing pipelines makes it difﬁcult to integrate the results into clinical practice (Chancellor & De Choudhury, 2020). Observational studies have also lacked the rigor of causal analysis, often stopping at correlational observations. Despite capturing multitudes of people, each data source has substantial biases that must be not only acknowledged by the researchers but accounted for in the analytical pipeline (Yom-Tov, 2019). Finally, data ownership, global justice, and ethical oversight are all important problems that need to be addressed for digital epidemiology to gain legitimacy on the scientiﬁc and policy stage (Vayena et al., 2015). We will touch on these and other peculiarities of using computational social science for epidemiology in the next section. 15.3 Computational Guidelines The abovementioned literature not only pushes the boundaries of traditional epi- demiology and the purview of computing but addresses multiple important policy questions regarding public health. The third goal of the UN Sustainable Develop- ment Goals (SDGs) is to “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all 15 Digital Epidemiology 285 ages”.2 For instance, the goal encompasses the work on alleviating communicable and non-communicable diseases, prevention and treatment of substance abuse, ensuring access to sexual and reproductive services, and increasing the healthcare capacity in all countries, but especially in the developing ones. Although CSS cannot build the necessary infrastructure, it can measure, on both community and individual scale, the utilization of healthcare services, the barriers experienced by the populous, and the expression of unfulﬁlled needs. Furthermore, it can help in tracking and forecasting disease, again at the scales including individuals, thus measuring the impact of potential ongoing interventions. In fact, CSS can help to craft, deploy, and monitor epidemiological interventions by providing detailed proﬁling of the target audience, individualized message delivery, and ﬁne-grained behavioural feedback. In order to bring these promises to fruition, a slew of challenges remain to be fully addressed by the research and policy community, including data access and privacy, construct validity, methodological transparency, sampling bias, accounting for confounders, and ﬁnally sufﬁciently clear communication to ensure real-world application. Below, we discuss several policy questions that CSS may address and outline technical and organizational best practices. 15.3.1 Infectious Diseases The modelling and predicting of infectious diseases is perhaps the most well-known purview of digital epidemiology. Some of the simplest models of disease spread use a system of states as a basis, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model wherein the population can be put into one of these three states (Bjørnstad et al., 2020). Other compartmental models exist which describe the progression of disease with more states (“compartments”), including Asymptomatic infectious, Hospitalized, etc. (Blackwood & Childs, 2018). Such states may also include behaviours of the population segments, including those produced via interventions such as quarantining (Maier & Brockmann, 2020) and wearing masks (Ngonghala et al., 2020). The SIR model has also been extended to incorporate the age structure in the contact matrices (Walker et al., 2020). Compartmental models are popular because they can be designed to frame the essential parts of a question and to work with reduced amounts of data for calibration. By varying parameters such as time between cases, average rate an individual can infect another, and the time infected individual can recover, researchers can estimate the case increase, as well as other properties of the epidemic. For instance, during the COVID-19 epidemic, the effective reproduction number R, or average number of secondary cases per infectious case in a population made up of both susceptible and non-susceptible hosts, has been closely watched and estimated in different affected countries, providing an important characterization of the disease’s spread (D’Arienzo & 2 https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3 286 Y. Mejova Coniglio, 2020). This classic model has been recently challenged and improvements have been proposed. For instance, the assumption that any individual may contact and thus infect any other in a population (homogeneous mixing) has been shown to be oversimpliﬁcation of the way people interact in reality; instead, considering other information, such as differential susceptibility by age, may improve the models models (Q.-H. Liu et al., 2018). Further, the availability of large-scale data has allowed scholars to model the real- world networks more accurately. The effect of network structure has been studied in the context of epidemic spreading velocity (Cui et al., 2014)and size (Y. Liu et al., 2016;Wu et al., 2015) and thresholds (Silva et al., 2019). Pandemic outbreaks have been found to be supported in networks with high assortativity (Moreno et al., 2003) and those having community structures (Z. Liu & Hu, 2005). The plethora of data has also allowed the application of agent-based models (ABMs) which attempt to capture empirical socio-demographic characteristics such as household’s sizes and compositions, however at a larger computational cost. Such models have been used to incorporate empirical knowledge about contact rates within and between age groups (Ogden et al., 2020) and comorbidities (Wilder et al., 2020). Most such models are built using known population statistics, such as the ABM built to simulate disease evolution in France in order to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 lockdowns, physical distancing, and mask-wearing (Hoertel et al., 2020). Alternatively, contact tracing data has been used to build detailed community network approximations, such as one built for Boston, by considering anonymized GDPR-compliant mobile location data in combination with 83,000 places from Foursquare (Aleta et al., 2020). To make sure data sparsity does not result in individual privacy violations, the authors use a probabilistic approach to measure co-presence. Thus, ABMs have been useful in furthering our understanding of the changes to contact networks and their impact on disease transmission. Fine-grained mobile phone data has been used to estimate population movements affecting the spread of inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) predating COVID-19. In Tizzoni et al. (2014), the data comes as a set of phone calls georeferenced to the cellphone tower. The authors estimate that a user’s most frequent location in the data is their residence and second-most frequent is the place of employment. Usually obtained via extensive (and expensive) surveys, such information is revolutionizing disease modelling on both local and global scales. Beyond phone records, internet data has also been used to monitor mobility. These works show the possibility for large corporations to surface anonymized, aggregated, and differentially private data in order to assist public health researchers and decision-makers. These include Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (Google, 2021a), Apple Mobility Trends Reports (Apple., 2021), and Facebook Disease Prevention Maps (Facebook, 2021b), all of which aggregate the massive amounts of information their platforms collect about the location of their users. All three resources have been used to gauge the changes in mobility of during the COVID-19 lockdowns (Mejova & Kourtellis, 2021; Shepherd et al., 2021; Woskie et al., 2021). However, if one wants to obtain a more nuanced understanding of contact networks, wearable technologies can be used to detect face-to-face interactions within, say, an organization or a building. 15 Digital Epidemiology 287 Unobtrusive sensors have been used to detect close proximity interactions at 1.5 m in order to reveal the interaction patterns among healthcare workers and patients in a hospital (Vanhems et al., 2013), as well as at an academic conference (Smieszek et al., 2016) and within several households in Kenya (Kiti et al., 2016). Large-scale proximity sensors were later used by many governments during the COVID-19 epidemic through passive contact tracing apps, which use anonymous identiﬁers to remember devices which were in a close proximity of a person and which can notify their users in case somebody within their contact history has been found to be COVID-positive (Barrat et al., 2020). But before the disease can be tracked, its very presence needs to be detected. Computational social science presents several unprecedented data sources that enable researchers to “now-cast” disease as it moves through the population. As mentioned, web search data has been used to monitor ILI symptoms (Ginsberg et al., 2009) and is still used for many others. However, one does not need to be a Google employee to perform such research, as aggregated search data is surfaced by the company via Google Search Trends (Google, 2021b), which has been used to track anything from Lyme disease (Kapitány-Fövény et al., 2019)to type 2 diabetes (Tkachenko et al., 2017). Of course, other dynamic social media have been used to track disease, including Twitter, Reddit, and Sina Weibo, all of which have been used to track non-communicable diseases as well. Beyond observation, self-reported data can be obtained from participatory surveillance systems, such as InﬂuenzaNet (Koppeschaar et al., 2017), which collects inﬂuenza- related information from thousands of volunteers from countries around the EU. Both algorithmic and data advances described above come with many caveats which both the scientiﬁc and policy communities are yet to tackle effectively. As machine learning and other modelling algorithms become more complex, difﬁculties in communicating their beneﬁts and—more importantly—limitations to those outside the initiated trained practitioners result in misunderstandings about the certainty of the predictions and limits of their applications, leading to a limited deployment in the ﬁeld. However, the solution may not lie in a more detailed description of the algorithms, but in the clariﬁcation of their merits, such that we can be determined whether their performance warrants their integration in the decision- making process of policymaking. One could take a page from the social science “reproducibility crisis” (Camerer et al., 2018) which illustrated the bias toward signiﬁcant, positive, and theoretically neat results at the cost of valid, generalizable insights. Several actions, including the Social Sciences Replication Project (SSRP), the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (RPP), and the Experimental Economics Replication Project (EERP), have been organized to provide increased rigor to the insights on important theories and results in each ﬁeld. Beyond reproducibility, integration of new methodologies should be tested in prediction competitions, such as CDC’s FluSight, a competition that brings together researchers and industry leaders to forecast the timing, peak, and intensity of the ﬂu season (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., 2021). Another ongoing effort is the ECDC’s European Covid-19 Forecast Hub which collates and combines short-term forecasts of COVID-19 generated by different independent modelling teams across Europe 288 Y. Mejova and makes available a near-term future trajectory of the pandemic (European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), 2021). The legitimacy afforded by such efforts would encourage the data owners (e.g. internet/technology companies including social media websites and phone companies) to contribute datasets that would level the playing ﬁeld between well-funded and smaller players. It is especially important to solicit both algorithmic and expert (human) predictions in order to provide a baseline for comparison, as it has been shown that people tend to distrust algorithms faster when they make mistakes, compared to when humans do the same (Dietvorst et al., 2015). Increased transparency in the way epidemiological studies are designed, the kind of data they use, and—crucially—their predictions ahead of the target date are all likely not only to clarify the potential impact of the new methods on public health but also to unify the ﬁeld under a set of common goals (Miguel et al., 2014). This proposal will hopefully address several other critiques. Legitimizing and clearly describing the uses of data would give a greater transparency to the sec- ondary use of data, greater oversight over anonymization standards, and aggregate statistics of its biases. Biases in data collection have been a constant critique of scientiﬁc endeavours; however, it may be even easier to gloss over biases in big datasets, but it has been shown that even large datasets of internet or technology users have substantial biases in terms of demographics, wealth, and technological access (Hargittai, 2020;Yom-Tov, 2019). Sampling biases limit the generalizability of the scientiﬁc studies. As such biases tend to underrepresent those coming from more disadvantaged backgrounds and locales, systematic testing of the algorithms on different populations would provide a quantiﬁable measure of the change in performance across groups of interest (Olteanu et al., 2019). The peculiarities of the digital platforms provide another constraint, including the affordances provided by each website, as well as the peculiar user base and culture. For instance, the privacy and identiﬁcation limitations on Facebook distinguish it from more open platforms, like Twitter, or community-oriented ones, like Reddit, resulting in differences of information disclosure and propagation. The very timing of the studies imposes biases speciﬁc to the time period selected for the analysis (for instance, 2020 will likely be a special year in many datasets), making some observations unique to the contemporary societal, technological, and public health situation. To address some of these problems, scientists must be encouraged to publish replication studies, as well as to extend them into long-term projects, in order to test the models initially proposed on different data and time spans. Further, establishing data partnerships addressing important public health concerns will insure the infrastructure is in place in case a crisis, such as the COVID-19 epidemic, strikes. 15.3.2 Non-communicable Diseases As medicine advanced against infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases have become the leading causes of death and illness throughout developed and developing 15 Digital Epidemiology 289 world. Many of such conditions, including obesity and the overweight, diabetes, and cardiovascular complications, have a strong “lifestyle” component, wherein the daily activities of the population accumulate to contribute to worsening outcomes. CSS provides a unique view of such behaviours, using the digital traces left through these daily activities such as social media posts, business check-ins, web searches, use of applications, and many others. Behaviours around food consumption and nutrition have been studied using Twitter (Abbar et al., 2015), Instagram (Mejova et al., 2015), as well as large datasets of grocery purchases (Aiello et al., 2019). Often, natural language processing (NLP) tools are used to process the text obtained from many internet users or deep machine learning (ML) models to “recognize” relevant objects in the shared images in order to understand the daily behaviours of the internet users. Crucially, these activities can be put into a cultural context to better understand the societal, economic, and psychological forces shaping these daily decisions, much as proposed by Weiss as “cultural epidemiology” (Weiss, 2001) that combines quantitative and qualitative methodologies. For instance, large datasets of recipes have been examined in order to establish a network of ﬂavours and ingredients across countries and relate it to the health outcomes of different locales (Sajadmanesh et al., 2017). The relationship between economic deprivation on diet in the USA has shown that those living in “food deserts” mention food that is higher in fat, cholesterol, and sugar than otherwise (De Choudhury, Sharma, et al., 2016). Further, specialized apps and wearables are used to monitor physical activity. For example, a study of running tracking app data (Aral & Nicolaides, 2017)aimed to understand the role of social interaction and comparison on the duration of one’s run. However, some researchers aim to go beyond behavioural proﬁling and use internet search data to detect those potentially having serious illness. A team used search query logs to ﬁrst identify users who mentioned having a diabetes diagnosis and compare them to a control group (Hochberg et al., 2019). Researchers were able to predict whether a user will be searching for diabetes-related words from their previous queries with a positive predictive value of 56% at a false-positive rate of 1% at up to 240 days before they mention the diagnosis. In general, it was found that people tend to search about symptoms some time before they are diagnosed with the underlying condition (Hochberg et al., 2020), especially if the symptoms are serious. Yet more data is available to monitor disease on a population level via information surfaced by the advertising systems of large social media platforms. For instance, Facebook allows potential advertisers to run detailed queries on their target audience, specifying their demographics, precise location, language, and interests (which span health concerns, activities, hobbies, worldviews, and many more categories) (Facebook, 2021a). These can then be used as a kind of “digital census” to quantify awareness of health-related topics and behaviours related to non- communicable diseases within well-deﬁned demographic groups across ﬁne and broad geographies (Mejova, Weber, et al., 2018). Compared to traditional survey- based monitoring, the above studies provide unobtrusive, real-time, and extremely rich sources of behavioural observation. Especially on social media, the users are self-motivated to share their meals and activities, to annotate them with geographic and other metadata, and to interact with other posts. Although suffering from social 290 Y. Mejova desirability bias, in combination with other consumption statistics, social media and app use data provide important signals about the social and psychological context of health-related behaviours. Further, non-communicable disease interventions can be studied on a personal level while delivered through a myriad of technologies. Integration of smartphones with user-generated content is leading to sophisticated personalized interventions aiming at motivating the users to increase their physical activity level (Harrington et al., 2018;op den Akker et al., 2014). Different messaging strategies have been explored including personalized exercise recommendation (Tseng et al., 2015), also employing machine learning via supervised learning (Hales et al., 2016;Marsaux et al., 2016) and reinforcement learning (Rabbi et al., 2015; Yom-Tov et al., 2017). Others help users ﬁnd exercise partners (Hales et al., 2016) and provide educational materials (Short et al., 2017) and emotional support (Vandelanotte et al., 2015). The applications have been embraced by the governments and businesses worldwide. For instance, UK’s National Health Service promotes an Active 10 app that encourages everyone to have a brisk walk and for those ready for a bigger challenge has Couch to 5K app for beginner runners (National Health Service., 2021). India’s Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports launched its Fit India app to help its populous keep track of their ﬁtness goals, water intake, and sleep (Play Store., 2021). Social media is, of course, another popular outlet for public health outreach. Many associations, such as the National Eating Disorders Association in the USA, run annual health awareness campaigns on different social media channels, making it possible to measure the impact of their campaigns on the sustainability of the attention to the topic and other subsequent behaviours expressed by their audience (Mejova & Suarez-Lledó, 2020). To assist in the efforts, some researchers focus on which inﬂuencers and content (especially contagious “memes”) are particularly successful in attracting an audience (Kostygina et al., 2020) or how to better identify the relevant users to target (Chu et al., 2019). Although the above studies provide a valuable context to the ongoing epi- demics of non-communicable diseases, and potential avenues to communicate about them, mostly observational studies usually fail to reach the threshold for causal insight. Often large datasets lack the information on important confounders that may affect the outcome of the study. For instance, while comparing health- related interests expressed by Facebook users to rates of obesity, diabetes, and alcoholism, researchers have found that unrelated (or “placebo”) interests, such as those in entertainment or technology, also had substantial correlation with the rates of disease (Mejova, Weber, et al., 2018). Some attempt to improve the quality of their models by employing instrumental variables, especially when the explanatory variable of interest is correlated with the error term. Weather is a popular instrumental variable, as it is often not related to the dependent variable, but may have some relationship with the independent ones. In their study of social contagion in a community of runners, the authors used the weather at one person’s location as an instrumental variable when modelling the running behaviour of another (Aral & Nicolaides, 2017). They show that without the corrections, the effect would have been overestimated by 71–82%. The inability to acquire multi- 15 Digital Epidemiology 291 dimensional data that has important confounders (which are often demographics, protected by numerous privacy regulations) has an additional effect of hiding the unequal relevance of the ongoing work to those less represented in these datasets. Inferring sensitive information, including age, gender, and location, may be possible from some sources of data, but such activity may both break the privacy of the platform and violate the protections imposed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is thus imperative to engage legitimate stakeholders who will negotiate controlled releases of highly detailed data for research on pressing topics and especially provide input during policy changes when a “natural experiment” may take place. Policymakers may also want to explicitly outline the under-served populations they would like to focus on, thus encouraging the creation of datasets around groups that are not yet captured in currently available data. For instance, India’s efforts in the National Mission for Empowerment of Women (NMEW) may be augmented by encouraging the monitoring of technology use through available data (Mejova, Gandhi et al., 2018). Alternatively, access to care can be monitored using online tools, such as those for women’s health services (Dodge et al., 2018) across the USA. 15.3.3 Mental Illness and Suicide An especially vulnerable population that has been extensively studied by CSS in the context of epidemiology is people with diagnosed mental illness, or those simply expressing mental distress, alongside those who vocally contemplate suicide. The anonymity and social support provided by the internet forums and websites allow many to express feelings and thoughts which may be difﬁcult to evoke using standard public health methods like surveys and medical records. The pervasive use of social media, including on mobile devices, allows users to post instantly during the moments of mental distress and for some to integrate digital platforms into their coping mechanisms. Communities around eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia, etc.) (Stewart et al., 2017; Yom-Tov et al., 2012), depression (De Choudhury et al., 2013; Reece & Danforth, 2017), and drug abuse (Kazemi et al., 2017)and recovery (Chancellor et al., 2019) are providing valuable insights in the way people experience these conditions, seek and provide support, and even provide practical advice. For instance, by combining automated machine learning classiﬁcation and text processing techniques with clinical expertise, researchers have used the Reddit opioid addiction recovery forums to discover alternative treatments that the users share and discuss (Chancellor et al., 2019). It is also possible to monitor the progression of mental illness to serious suicide ideation by examining suicide prevention forums (De Choudhury, Kiciman et al., 2016), as well as studying web search patterns (Adler et al., 2019). Studies of search engine usage have been able to conﬁrm behavioural signs of people with autism, for instance, ﬁnding that users who have self-stated that they have autism spend less time examining image results (Yechiam, Yom-Tov et al., 2021). Whereas most studies rely on self-declaration 292 Y. Mejova of diagnosis, some studies use social media to better understand those who have been conﬁrmed to be clinically diagnosed. Facebook posts of patients diagnosed with a primary psychotic disorder have been analysed to ﬁnd predictors of a future psychotic relapse (Birnbaum et al., 2019). However, the very fact that self-expression of mental distress may come before ofﬁcial diagnosis makes such research struggle with construct validity, that is, what exactly is being measured, and how robust it is in clinical terms. Reviews of literature on mental health status on social media show that few use the deﬁnitions and theories developed in the clinical setting to deﬁne, for instance, the conditions of “anxiety” or “depression” that are being tracked (Chancellor & De Choudhury, 2020). Whether mentions of disorders on social media capture users who are struggling with them, merely interested in the topic, or even misusing the terms is an important question to answer before these methods can be applied to the clinical setting. It is imperative to foster a closer collaboration between the medical establishment and researchers attempting to contribute to the epidemiology of conditions possibly discussed in user-generated data. From the CSS research community’s side, it is important to rigorously deﬁne the cohorts of interest and follow clinically validated diagnostic procedures (Ernala et al., 2019) when studying new sources of data and methods for identifying those potentially struggling with mental illness. However, it is also desirable to have the medical community to acknowledge these new sources of information as an additional signal that should be clinically studied and which may play a role in ofﬁcial diagnostic (and possibly treatment) frameworks. As mentioned earlier, methods based on alternative data sources may play a role in the proﬁling of future recruits for studies, potentially expanding their reach beyond those already in the medical system. 15.3.4 Beliefs, Information, and Misinformation User-generated data provides yet another unique context around health and disease: the dynamics of individual’s knowledge, opinion, and belief and their interactions with various information sources that shape these important precursors to behaviour. The quality of medical information available to people on social media and through web search can be evaluated using big data NLP tools and in collaboration with area experts. YouTube videos have been found to be some of the worst offenders in terms of advocating methods proven to be harmful or having no scientiﬁc basis (Madathil et al., 2015). Twitter (Rosenberg et al., 2020), Reddit (Jang et al., 2019), and Pinterest (Guidry & Messner, 2017) all have been examined for links to potentially harmful health advice. One of the most serious problems is the anti-vaccination movement that has been strengthening in both developed and developing countries. Twitter data has proven to be useful in explaining some variation in the vaccine coverage rates, as reported by the immunization monitoring system of WHO (Bello- Orgaz et al., 2017). Classifying whether social media users support or oppose vaccinations has been shown to be feasible, both using deep learning on the 15 Digital Epidemiology 293 posted text and images (Wang et al., 2020) and using network algorithms on the conversation network (Cossard et al., 2020). However, it is in the more specialized websites, such as the discussion forums for parents, that give space to those who are hesitant and are in the process of making healthcare decisions for themselves or their family. There, researchers can ﬁnd lists of concerns, previous experiences, and information seeking, as well as testimonials about the experiences with the medical establishment (Betti et al., 2021). Further, internet captures myriad interactions with medical services and con- sequences of health interventions. Social media has been used extensively for pharmacovigilance, discovering drug side effects (Alvaro et al., 2015), drug inter- actions (Correia et al., 2016), and recreational drug use (Deluca et al., 2012)and even uncovering illicit online pharmacies (Katsuki et al., 2015). Patient experiences can be found on business review websites (Rastegar-Mojarad et al., 2015), as well as general-purpose social media, where communities can discuss their perceptions of treatment (Booth et al., 2019; Hswen et al., 2020). Super-utilizers of healthcare services have also been studied on social media in order to inform online social support interventions and complement ofﬂine community care services (Guntuku et al., 2021), and efforts have been made to integrate patient experiences in online discussions into customer satisfaction and service quality measures (Albarrak & Li, 2018). As more and more people use internet and social media as a source of medical knowledge and advice, as well as social support, understanding how this information is translated into behaviours and life choices is an increasingly urgent research direction. Although the detection of cyberbullying and other negative speech on social media is an active research direction (Chatzakou et al., 2019), ethical concerns prevent the integration of user proﬁling and targeting in mental health interventions. However, health misinformation has been acknowledged to be a parallel pandemic in the COVID-19 era, and concerted efforts are ongoing in monitoring and tackling potentially harmful information (World Health Organization, 2021a). In this sphere, CSS will continue to play an important role by providing the tools for the analysis of new social and information sharing platforms that are increasingly permeating the information landscape. 15.4 The Way Forward Epidemiology was one of the ﬁrst of the sciences to use large datasets, and thus, it is in a natural position to take advantage of the latest developments in digitization, big data, and computing methods. The year 2020 has forced the ﬁeld to mobilize its best resources to address the COVID-19 pandemic and put in stark light the challenges facing the ﬁeld. The silver lining of this dark cloud could be an understanding of the necessary steps in bringing digital epidemiology into the policy sphere, making it agile and relevant in a fast-moving globalized world. 294 Y. Mejova The COVID-19 pandemic has imparted an important component to the epidemi- ological ﬁeld—a clarity of vision. It has shown in a stark contrast the cost of indecision and the global repercussions on the lives and economies and forced the realities of a global pandemic to the public and the governmental attention. It has also revealed weaknesses in the current health policy structures, the slow response of the governments to the WHO’s messaging, and disarray in the case tracking and reporting standards. Already, actions are in place to remedy these weaknesses. Attempts are being made to formalize the government responses through treaties and international agreements (though enforcing such agreements remains a struggle) (Maxmen, 2021). Partnerships are being forged, and large companies released detailed datasets of user activity and mobility to aid in monitoring and modelling (National Institutes of Health., 2021). Such clarity of vision is necessary to improve the impact of digital epidemiology also in other spheres. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)3 provide a general prioritization for the health and well-being challenges, but these must be deﬁned clearly in order to encourage the building of tools and partnerships. One such effort is the European Data Space, which aims to legitimize and operationalize the data usage across the member states while complying with its established privacy regulations.4 Another is the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence which aims to build a “global trust architecture” that will encourage greater sharing of data through addressing numerous aspects: “governance, legal frameworks and data-sharing agreements; data solidarity, fairness and beneﬁts sharing; transparency about how pandemic and epidemic intelligence outputs are used; openness of tech- nology solutions and artiﬁcial intelligence applications; security of data; combating misinformation and addressing infodemics; privacy by design principles; and public participation and people’s data literacy” (World Health Organization, 2021b,c). Additionally, the One Health movement, supported by the WHO, emphasizes the collaboration between disparate domains to accomplish a systems-level perspective on problems such as antibiotic resistance (World Health Organization., 2017). These ambitious projects are a response to a complex problem that involves many parties, some of which only recently began weighing the beneﬁts and dangers of massive surveillance for the greater good. Several important steps need to be taken in order to engage all major parties involved. First, civil society must be educated in the basics of digital literacy, data privacy, and its governance in order to ensure the users of technologies contributing to the big data revolution provide truly informed consent. For instance, the EU has proposed the Digital Competence Framework that comprises not only information literacy but also skills in communication, digital content creation, safety, and problem-solving (EU Science Hub., 2021). Second, the professionals coming from different civic, academic, and policy silos must be brought together and upskilled to legibly communicate about the role of data in public health. For instance, efforts 3 https://sdgs.un.org/goals 4 https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/dataspace_en 15 Digital Epidemiology 295 such as the Lagrange Fellowships in Italy (Fondazione CRT., 2019); the Data Science for Social Good Fellowship in Chicago, USA (University of Chicago., 2021); and the Data Fellowship at the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data (Centre for Humanitarian Data, 2021) are excellent efforts to impart data science skills in the next generation of humanitarians, epidemiologists, and academics. Institutionally, the normalization of building teams that incorporate data literacy (and analytics skills, if possible) is an ongoing process that is only recently being supported by educational resources. Third, the governance of technology giants that own much of the data necessary for monitoring and modelling disease must be kept clear and up- to-date considering the latest technological developments. Interestingly, during the COVID-19 efforts to build contact tracing apps, it was the corporations (Apple and Google) that refused to implement features that would threaten the privacy of their users (privacy being an important feature of their services) (Meyer, 2021). However, one must not rely on the businesses to maintain ethical standards of data use, which must be carefully negotiated before the next disaster strikes. Much of this chapter describes the impressive accomplishments by the aca- demic researchers in the ﬁelds of disease monitoring, modelling, prediction, and contextualization. However, to bring these tools to the policymakers’ table, they must be robust, vetted, and available on demand. Additional organization is necessary to establish a well-deﬁned set of problems for the community to tackle and to provide legitimacy in order to foster data exchange to support research. Standardizing the tasks (such as ﬂu season prediction), metrics, available data, and benchmarks will allow for an increased accountability and reproducibility of academic endeavours that go beyond publication peer review. Such tasks should be deﬁned in collaboration with the policymakers in order to align the priorities with the societal needs and system outputs with the information needs. The way Netﬂix Prize has invigorated the recommender systems community (Netﬂix, 2009) and Google Flu Trends spurred interest in the digital disease tracking (Google., 2014), ambitious competitions not only would provide clarity of vision for the ﬁeld but would also be able to direct the research agenda to under-served areas and communities. It would be beneﬁcial if the collaborative efforts described above would include a space for the academics and researchers to tackle speciﬁc problems within an evaluation framework that produces benchmark datasets and reproducible methods, beyond scientiﬁc publications. Finally, the technological development will continue revolutionizing the ﬁeld, spurring debate on additional policy considerations. The advances in deep machine learning are allowing to process speech, images, and video at scale and are already being used for plant (Ferentinos, 2018) and human (Li et al., 2020) disease detection. The rise of conﬁdential computing, wherein user data is isolated and protected on the user’s device, and only trusted operations can be run on it, eliminates the need to transfer the data for processing elsewhere (Rashid, 2020). The negotiation between the new potential insights and the cost to the society will require thoughtful, informed, and urgent consideration. 296 Y. Mejova References Abbar, S., Mejova, Y., & Weber, I.

Chapter 16 Learning Analytics in Education for the Twenty-First Century Kristof De Witte and Marc-André Chénier Abstract The online traces that students leave on electronic learning platforms; the improved integration of educational, administrative and online data sources; and the increasing accessibility of hands-on software allow the domain of learning analytics to ﬂourish. Learning analytics, as in interdisciplinary domain borrowing from statistics, computer sciences and education, exploits the increased accessibility of technology to foster an optimal learning environment that is both transparent and cost-effective. This chapter illustrates the potential of learning analytics to stimulate learning outcomes and to contribute to educational quality management. Moreover, it discusses the increasing emergence of large and accessible data sets in education and compares the cost-effectiveness of learning analytics to that of costly and unreliable retrospective studies and surveys. The chapter showcases the potential of methods that permit savvy users to make insightful predictions about student types, performance and the potential of reforms. The chapter concludes with recommendations, challenges to the implementation and growth of learning analytics. 16.1 Introduction Education stakeholders are currently working within an environment where vast quantities of data can be leveraged to have a deeper understanding of the educational attainment of learners.

Chénier which students, teachers and administrators interact (Kassab et al., 2020), through apps, social networking and the collection of user behaviour on aggregators such as YouTube and Google (De Wit & Broucker, 2017). Moreover, thanks to the Internet of Everything phenomenon, stakeholders in the education domain have access to data in which people, processes, data and things connect to the internet and to each other (Langedijk et al., 2019). That data takes on non-traditional formats and retains language, location, movement, networks, images and video information (Lazer et al., 2020). Such non-traditional data sets require cutting-edge analytical techniques in order to be effectively used for learning purposes and to be translated into succinct policy recommendations. Learning analytics, as an interdisciplinary domain borrowing from statistics, computer sciences and education (Leitner et al., 2017), exploits this new data- rich landscape to improve the learning process and outcomes of current and future citizens (De Wit & Broucker, 2017). In education, learning analytics is set squarely within the new computational social sciences, which consist in the “development and application of computational methods to complex, typically large-scale human behavioral data” (Lazer et al., 2009). Learning analytics directs these advances towards the creation of actionable information in education. It applies data analytics to the ﬁeld of education, and it attempts to propose ways to explore, analyse and visualize data from any relevant data source (Vanthienen & De Witte, 2017). An important role of learning analytics is the exploitation of the traces left by students on electronic learning platforms (Greller & Drachsler, 2012). As such, learning analytics allows teachers to maximize the cognitive and non-cognitive education outcomes of students (Long & Siemens, 2011). In an optimal learning environment, one would maximally leverage the potential of students to increase their welfare and performance not only during schooling but also afterwards, across civil society. As the COVID-19 pandemic induced shifts towards online and home education, there is an increased opportunity for data analytics in general and to mitigate the crisis’ effects both on learning outcomes (Maldonado & De Witte, 2021) and on the well-being of students (Iterbeke & De Witte, 2020) in particular. The online traces that students leave on electronic learning platforms allow teachers, schools and policy-makers to better tailor targeted remedial teaching interventions to the most needy students. The closures of schools also showed how unequally digital devices are spread among students, with signiﬁcant groups of disadvantaged students without access to basic digital instruments such as stable broadband access and computer. Similarly, the school closures revealed signiﬁcant differences between countries in their readiness for online teaching and in the availability of high-quality digital instruction. Still, thanks to the unprecedented crisis, multiple countries made signiﬁcant investments in the educational ICT infrastructure (De Witte & Smet, 2021). If this coincides with improved training of teachers and school managers; an improved integration of educational, administrative and online data sources; and the improved accessibility of hands-on software, we expect to see the domain of learning analytics to further ﬂourish in the next decades. The following chapter aims to contribute to this accelerated use of learning analytics by picturing its potential in multiple educational domains. We ﬁrst discuss 16 Learning Analytics in Education for the Twenty-First Century 307 the increasing emergence of large and accessible data sets in education and the associated growth in expertise in educational data collection and analysis. This is sustained by real-time streamed data and increasingly autonomous administrative data sets. Section 16.2 compares the cost-effectiveness of learning analytics to that of costly and unreliable retrospective studies and surveys. Learning analytics may also contribute to the improvement in the quality of the currently dispensed education through fraud detection and student performance prediction, for example. In Sect. 16.3, three tools of growing popularity and potential for learning analytics are presented: the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), the Social Network Analysis (SNA) and the Natural Language Processing (NLP). These tools permit savvy users to make insightful predictions about student types, performance and the potential of reforms. The brief description of these techniques aims to familiarize practitioners and decision-makers with their potential. Finally, alongside recommen- dations, technical and non-technical challenges to the implementation and growth of learning analytics and empirically based education in general are discussed. As the growing possibilities of learning analytics result in sensitive options regarding data usage and linkages, we discuss in the conclusion section the related ethical and legal concerns. 16.2 Potential for Educators and Citizens 16.2.1 Growing Opportunities for Data-Driven Policies in Education “Students and teachers are leaving large amounts of digital footprints and traces in various educational apps and learning management platforms, and education administrators register various processes and outcomes in digital administrative systems” (Nouri et al., 2019). In this section, we discuss three trends that allow for growing opportunities in fomenting creative data-driven policies in education: (1) the development of online teaching platforms, (2) software-oriented administrative data collection with links between heterogeneous data sets (Langedijk et al., 2019) and (3) the Internet of Things (Langedijk et al., 2019). First, consider the online teaching platforms. A prime example of the latter are massive open online courses (i.e. MOOCs, De Smedt et al., 2017). Institutional MOOC initiatives have been contributing to making high-quality educational material accessible to a wide range of students and to maintaining the prestige of the participating institutions (Dalipi et al., 2018). For adults, MOOC completion has also been associated with increased resilience to unemployment (Castaño-Muñoz & Rodrigues, 2021). From a learning analytics perspective, it is interesting to observe that all student activities can be tracked within the MOOC. This information has been studied to give empirical grounding to suggestions to reduce course dropout by fostering peer engagements on online forums, team homeworks and peer evaluations 308 K. De Witte and M.-A. Chénier (Dalipi et al., 2018). From a methodological perspective, some of the innovative methodologies exploiting MOOC’s large data sets include K-means clustering, support vector machines and hidden Markov models.1 A second trend in data-driven policies in education arise from software-oriented administrative data collections. These refer to the digital warehousing of adminis- trative data such that this data can be relatively easily linked with other data sets and easily transformed through, for example, the inclusion of a large quantity of new observations (e.g. student ﬁles) and the ad hoc addition of new variables of interest (Agasisti et al., 2017). Administrative data sets are built around procedures whose aims are not primarily to foster data-driven policies (Barra et al., 2017; Rettore & Trivellato, 2019). In that sense, they can provide rich information about students and other educational stakeholders while being quicker to gather and signiﬁcantly cheaper than retrospective surveys (Figlio et al., 2016). As a major advantage, software-oriented administrative data collections can be easily linked to other data sources, such as the wide array of information surveyed by local governments in their interactions with citizens. Through software integration, data regarding such diverse domains as public health and agriculture may be seamlessly captured. To conceptualize the diversity of potential data sources, Langedijk et al. (2019) describe those data as divided into thematic silos. Each silo represents an important civil concern, health or education, for example, and within each silo, stakeholders can deﬁne sub-themes onto which interesting data sets are attached. For example, in the case of education, some proposed sub-themes are standardized test results, textbook quality and teacher quality2 (Langedijk et al., 2019). Through the development of electronic networks, links cannot only be established within silos, where policy-makers may, for instance, be interested in the relation between teacher quality and test scores, but also across silos, where improvement in learning outcomes can be associated with changes in the health of citizens (Langedijk et al., 2019). The analyses required to measure such associations can take advantage of the typically long-run collection of administrative data (Figlio et al., 2016). As an additional advantage of the electronic networks, whereas data has traditionally been transmitted in batches, in order to produce descriptive reports at set time intervals, for example, electronic networks now permit event registration in real time (De Wit & Broucker, 2017; Mukala et al., 2015). The real-time extraction 1 K-means clustering divides the observations (e.g. a sample of teachers) into a quantity K of groups that share similar measured characteristics. That similarity is deﬁned as the squared distance to the mean of the group’s characteristics (Bishop, 2006). Support vector machines construct a porous hyperplane that maximally separate the observations closest to it. They are particularly useful to solve classiﬁcation problems with high-dimensional data (e.g. registered student activity during multiple lecture) (Bishop, 2006). Finally, hidden Markov models assume that measurements are generated by underlying hidden states. These hidden states are modelled as a Markov process (Bishop, 2006). That approach is particularly suited to the analysis of sequential data such as the quantity of attempts in an educational game (Tadayon, 2020). 2 Teacher quality is a multi-dimensional concept that is often proxied by teacher value-added scores. 16 Learning Analytics in Education for the Twenty-First Century 309 of data beneﬁts teachers and students who can rely, for example, on automated assignments and online dashboards in order to improve their learning experience and their learning outcomes (De Smedt et al., 2017). A good example of data set linkages in education are studies with population data that aim to explore education outcomes in speciﬁc subgroups. A recent study by Mazrekaj et al. (2020) made use of the rich micro-data sets made available to researchers by the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). These micro-data cover many themes of social life (e.g. ﬁnancial, educational, health, environmental, professional silos and more) and are, though of limited access because of privacy issues, easy to link together with standard analytics software. Third, consider the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things denotes the numer- ous physical devices with integrated internet connectivity (DeNardis, 2020). In educational settings, these devices are the computers, SNS services, mobile devices, camera, sensors and software with which students, teachers and administrators interact (Kassab et al., 2020). They are used to monitor student attendance and class behaviour and their interactions with online teaching services and laboratories. On online platforms, but also through mobile apps and logging platforms (e.g. library access, blogs, electronic learning environment), students’ and tutors’ behaviours and opinions can be monitored in real time and passed through automatic analytics platforms or saved to solve future policy issues (De Smedt et al., 2017;De Wit & Broucker, 2017). Similarly, RFID (radio-frequency identiﬁcation) sensors track the locations and availability of educational appliances such as laboratory equipment and projectors. Students and tutors can communicate with each other regardless of location, and assessment feedback can be delivered instantaneously, resulting in higher-quality education. 16.2.2 Learning Analytics as a Toolset The toolset of learning analytics can be used for several purposes. We ﬁrst provide some examples on how it can contribute to improve the cost-effectiveness of education and next how it can foster education outcomes on cognitive and non- cognitive scales. Finally, we provide examples of how learning analytics can assist in educational quality management. 16.2.2.1 Improving Cost-Effectiveness of Education The increasing public scrutiny and tighter budgets, which are an ever-present reality of the educational landscape, motivate a double goal for data-driven solutions. These must improve efﬁciency and performance with regard to learning outcomes while also proposing solutions that are competitive in terms of cost (Barra et al., 2017). There are two poles through which cost-effective learning analytics solutions can be proposed. 310 K. De Witte and M.-A. Chénier The ﬁrst pole stands at the level of data collection. Administrative data sets suffer from their high cost of data cleaning and collection. Indeed, although data extraction is usually native to recent administrative software (King, 2016), administrative data sets typically require ad hoc linkages and research designs (Agasisti et al., 2017). In the sense that their inclusion in data-driven decision-making is not their primary purpose, they constitute an opportunistic data source and thus may occasionally demand more resource investments than deliberate data collection procedures. Meanwhile, the omnipresent network of computing devices and the associated online educational platforms permit data extraction at every step of the learning process (De Smedt et al., 2017). As previously indicated, this type of unstructured data can be saved, but the real-time data stream can also be designed in such a way to permit automatic analyses. This deliberate pipeline associating the collected data to useful analyses can insure cost-effectiveness through economies of scales. It can also serve as a baseline to future improvements in summarizing data for students, teachers and stakeholders in general. In short, rich data sets and insightful analyses can be produced without requiring punctual organizational involvement. In that sense, the environment in which learning analytics is embedded permits professionals and stakeholders to beneﬁt from opportunistic analyses and from insights that are delivered efﬁciently (Barra et al., 2017). For example, during the COVID-19 crisis, learning analytics was used to monitor how students were reached by online teaching. The second pole to achieve cost-effectiveness in the establishment of data-driven policy-making for education is that of data analytics. Up until now, technologically able and creative teams have been achieving parity with the expanding volume, variety and velocity of data by developing and applying advanced analytical methods (De Wit & Broucker, 2017; King, 2016). One such method is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). It permits the employment of administrative and learning data in order to directly fulﬁl goals related to cost minimization (Barra et al., 2017; De Witte & López-Torres, 2017; Mergoni & De Witte, 2021). The result of such analyses may be useful in promoting efﬁcient investments in educational resources (see, e.g. the report by the European Commission Expert Group on Quality Investment in Education and Training). Additional spending brings to the forefront its paradoxical effect of increasing cost-effectiveness in the long run. Advances in social sciences have already demonstrated the consequences of poor learning outcomes, the principal of which are “lower incomes and economic growth, lower tax revenues, and higher costs of such public services as health, criminal justice, and public assistance” (Groot & van den Brink, 2017). Hence, learning outcomes deserve an important place in discussions around the cost-effectiveness of education (De Witte & Smet, 2021). 16.2.2.2 Improving Learning Outcomes In terms of directly improving educational quality, three ambitions can be distin- guished for learning analytics: making improvements in (non-)cognitive learning 16 Learning Analytics in Education for the Twenty-First Century 311 outcomes, reducing learning support frictions and a wide deployment and long-term maintenance for each teaching tool (Viberg et al., 2018). These ambitions are now discussed. First, learning outcomes can be interpreted as the academic performance of students, as measured by quizzes and examinations (Viberg et al., 2018). Learning outcomes can also be deﬁned in a broader way than similar testable outcomes, for example, by being related to interpersonal skills and civic qualities. However widely deﬁned, it is important that the set of criteria identifying educational success is well-deﬁned by stakeholders and that it is clearly communicated to and open to the contributions of citizens. In that way, educational policy discussions can be centred around transparent and recognized aims. Although there is a rich literature evaluating learning analytics in higher educa- tion, the contributions of learning analytics tools to improving the (non-)cognitive learning outcomes of secondary school students have received relatively little attention in the empirical literature (Bruno et al., 2021). Nevertheless, clear improvements in writing and argumentative quality have been associated with the use of automatic text evaluation softwares (Lee et al., 2019; Palermo & Wilson, 2020). These softwares use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyse data extracted from online learning platforms. Automatic text evaluation has also shown promising results at higher education levels and with non-traditional adult students (Whitelock et al., 2015b). There is thus ﬂexibility in terms of the type of students or teachers to whom learning analytics approaches apply. Another interesting contribution of learning analytics to the outcomes of sec- ondary school students has been in improving their computer programming abilities. This has been accomplished through another advanced data analysis technique, process mining, which helped teachers in pairing students based on captured behavioural traces during programming exercises (Berland et al., 2015). Second, with respect to learning support frictions, there is often a lag between the assumptions behind the design of learning platforms and the observed behaviours of students (Nguyen et al., 2018). An example of this lag is that students tend to spend less time studying than recommended by their instructors. Less involved students also tend to spend less time preparing assignments (Nguyen et al., 2018). By reducing their ability to receive feedback in a timely manner, a similar lag can negatively affect both students’ and teachers’ involvement in the learning process. Thanks to learning analytics tools, students will receive tailored feedback, will rehearse exercises that are particularly difﬁcult for them and will receive stimulating examples that ﬁt their interest (Iterbeke et al., 2020). This reduces the learning support frictions and consequently improves learning outcomes. Yet, the lag between the desired learning outcomes and student behaviour cannot be corrected simply through the implementation of electronic platforms or through a gamiﬁcation of the learning process. It is critical that the digital tools being implemented and those implementing them take students’ feedback into account. Many students are now used to accessing information without having to pass through much in the manner of physical and social barriers. For those students, the interactivity and the practicality of the digital learning tools are particularly 312 K. De Witte and M.-A. Chénier important (Pardo et al., 2018; Selwyn, 2019). Other students may not have the same familiarity with online computing devices. For these, accessibility has to be negotiated into the tools. Many authors warn of a transfer from magisterial education to learning platforms in which feedback and exercises may be too numerous, superﬁcial or ill-adapted to students’ capabilities or learning ambitions (Lonn et al., 2015; Pardo et al., 2018; Topolovec, 2018). Hence, a hybrid approach to learning support is suggested wherein technologies, such as those just touched upon of automatic text analyses and process mining, are combined with personalized feedback from teachers and tutors. Indeed, classroom teaching is often characterized by a lack of personalization and biases in the dispensation of feedback and exercises. For example, low-performing students are over-represented among the receiver of teacher feedback. Additionally, given the same learning objectives, feedback may be administrated differently to students of different genders and origins. Teachers may ﬁnd learning analytics tools useful in helping their students attain the desired learning outcomes while fostering their personal learning ambitions and their self-conﬁdence (Evans, 2013; Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Third, learning analytics can provide additional value to students and teachers. In that sense, we observe several clear advantageous applications of learning analytics. • Learning analytics could contribute to non-cognitive skills, as collaboration is an area where non-cognitive skills play an important role. Identifying collaboration and the factors that incite it can improve learning outcomes and even help in preventing fraud. The implementation of analytics methods such as Social Network Analysis (SNA) in learning platforms may allow teachers to prevent or foster such collaborations (De Smedt et al., 2017). Simple indicators like the time of assignment submission can be treated as proxies for collaboration. We discuss SNA more into depth in Sect. 16.3. • Another computational approach, process mining, can exploit real-time behavioural data to summarize the interactions of students with a given course’s material. Students can then be distinguished based on their mode of involvement in the course (Mukala et al., 2015). It allows teachers to learn how the teaching method results in behavioural actions. These insights can be incorporated in the course design, and on the detection of inefﬁcient behaviour, allowing fast and personalized intervention (De Smedt et al., 2017). • A conjoint method to generate value from learning analytics is by implementing text analyses directly on the learning platforms. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a text analysis method that has been shown to greatly improve the performance of students with regard to assignments such as the writing of essays (Whitelock et al., 2015a). Generally, text analysis can provide automated feedback shared with the students and their teachers (De Smedt et al., 2017). Providing automated feedback makes another argument for the cost-effectiveness of learning analytics. By giving course providers the ability to score large student bodies, it allows teachers to put more focus onto providing adapted support 16 Learning Analytics in Education for the Twenty-First Century 313 to their students (De Smedt et al., 2017). We discuss NLP into more depth in Sect. 16.3. • Not the least advantage of online learning is that it allows asynchronous and syn- chronous interactions and communications between the participants to a course (Broadbent & Poon, 2015). These interactions can be logged as unstructured data and incorporated into useful text, process and social network analyses. 16.2.2.3 Educational Quality Management A key component of quality improvement in education is the creation of quality and performance indicators related to teachers and schools (Vanthienen & De Witte, 2017). Learning analytics’ contribution to educational quality improvement is in providing data sources and computational methods and combining them in order to produce actionable summaries of teaching and schooling quality (Barra et al., 2017). Whereas, traditionally, data analyses have required punctual involvement and costly (time) investments from stakeholders, learning analytics can rely on computational power and dense networks of computational devices to automatically propose real- time reports to policy-makers. Below, contributions in terms of quality measurement and predictions are introduced. 16.2.2.4 Underlying Data for Quality Measurement Through the exploitation of unstructured, streamed, behavioural data and pre- existing administrative data sets, analytical reports can be updated in real time to reﬂect the state of education at any desired level, from the individual student and classroom to the country as a whole. That information is commonly ordered in online dashboards (De Smedt et al., 2017). Analysts and programmers can even allow the user to customize the presented summary in real time, by applying ﬁlters on maps and subgroups of students, for example. 16.2.2.5 Efﬁciency Measurement An aspect of the quality measurements provided by learning analytics is efﬁciency research, in which inputs and outputs are compared against a best practice frontier (see the earlier discussed Data Envelopment Analysis model). In this branch of literature, schools are, for instance, compared based on their ability to maximize learning outcomes given a set of educational inputs (De Witte & López-Torres, 2017; e Silva & Camanho, 2017; Mergoni & De Witte, 2021). The outcome of a similar analysis might be used for quality assessment purposes. 314 K. De Witte and M.-A. Chénier 16.2.2.6 Predictions When discussing the potential of learning analytics for educators and stakeholders, the ability to make predictions about learning outcomes is an unavoidable point of interest. In quantitative analyses, predictions are generated by translating latent patterns in historical data, be it structured or unstructured, in order to identify likely future outcomes (De Witte & Vanthienen, 2017). Predictions can be produced using, for example, the Bayesian Additive Regres- sion Trees (BART) model (see Sect. 16.3), as applied in Stofﬁ et al. (2021). There, linked administrative and PISA data available only in Flanders is used to distinguish a group of overwhelmingly under-performing Walloon students and explain their situation. Typically, such a technique uses administrative data that is available for both endowment groups in order to make a sensible generalization from one to the other. Alternatively, process mining can be used to identify clusters of students and distinguish successful interaction patterns with a course’s material (Mukala et al., 2015). Similar applications can be imagined for Social Network Analysis (De Smedtetal., 2017), through the evaluation of collaborative behaviour, and Natural Language Processing. These techniques are usually perceived as descriptive, but their output may very well be included in a predictive framework by education professionals and researchers. Learning analytics has initiated a shift from using purely predictive analytics as a mean to identify student retention probabilities and grades towards the application of a wider set of methods (Viberg et al., 2018). In return, cutting-edge exploratory and descriptive methods can improve traditional predictive pipelines. 16.3 An Array of Policy-Driving Tools It is one thing to comb over the numerous contributions and potential of learning analytics to data-informed decision-making; it is yet another to actually take the plunge and settle on tools for problem-solving in education. In what follows, a brief introduction to distinct methods from the ﬁeld of computational social sciences is provided. In that way, the reader can get acquainted with the intuition of the methods and how they can be used to improve learning outcomes and quality measurement in education. To set the scene, we also illustrate how the approaches open up the range of innovative educational questions that can be answered through learning analytics. 16.3.1 Bayesian Additive Regression Trees The Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) stems from machine learning and probabilistic programming. It is a predictive and classifying algorithm that makes 16 Learning Analytics in Education for the Twenty-First Century 315 solving complex prediction problems simple by relying on a set of sane param- eter conﬁgurations. Earlier comparable algorithms such as the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and the Random Forest (RF) require repeated adjustments that hinge the quality of their predictions on an analyst’s programming ability and lim- ited computational resources. By contrast, the BART incorporates prior knowledge about educational science problems in order to produce competitive predictions and measures of uncertainty after a single estimation run (Dorie et al., 2019). This contributes to the accessibility of knowledge discovery and the credibility of policy statements in education. As with the GBM and the RF, the essential and most basic component of the BART algorithm is the decision or prediction tree. The prediction tree is a classic predictive method that, unlike traditional regression methods, does not assume linear associations between sets of variable. It is robust to outlying variable values, such as those due to measurement error, and can accommodate a large quantity of data and high-dimensional data sets. Their accuracy and relative simplicity have made regression trees popular diagnostic and prediction tools in medicine and public health (Lemon et al., 2003; Podgorelec et al., 2002). In education, a recent application of regression trees has been to explore dropout motivations and predictors in tertiary education (Alfermann et al., 2021). The regression tree algorithm (i.e. CART or classiﬁcation and regression trees, Breiman et al., 2017) does variable selection automatically, so researchers are able to distinguish a few salient motivations, such as the perceived usefulness of the work, from a vast endowment of possible predictors. To predict quantities such as test scores or dropout risk, regression trees separate the observations into boxes associating a set of characteristics with an outcome. The trees are created in multiple steps. In each of these steps, all observations comprised in a box of characteristics are split in two new boxes. Each split is selected by the algorithm to maximize the accuracy of the desired predictions. The end result of this division of observations into smaller and smaller boxes are branches through which each individual observation descends into a leaf. That leaf is the ﬁnal box that assigns a single prediction value (e.g. a student’s well-being score) to the set of observations sharing its branch. Graphically, the end result is a binary decision tree where each split is illustrated by a programmatic if statement leading onto either the next binary split or a leaf. The Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) algorithm is the combination of many such small regression trees (Kapelner & Bleich, 2016). Each regression tree adds to the predictive performance of the algorithm by picking up on the mistakes and leftover information from the previously estimated trees. After hundreds or possibly thousands of such trees are estimated, complex and subtle associations can be detected in the data. This makes the BART algorithm particularly competitive in areas of learning analytics where a large quantity of data are collected and there is little existing theory as to how interesting variables may be related to the outcome of interest, be it some aspect of the well-being of students or their learning outcomes. The speciﬁc characteristic of the BART algorithm is its underlying Bayesian probability model (Kapelner & Bleich, 2016). By using prior probabilistic knowl- 316 K. De Witte and M.-A. Chénier edge to restrict estimation possibilities to realistic prediction scenario, the algorithm can avoid detecting spurious association between variables. Each data set, unless it constitutes a perfect survey of the entire population of interest, contains variable associations that are present purely due to chance. Such coincidental associations reduce the ability to predict true outcomes when they are included in predictive models. Thus, each regression tree estimated by the BART algorithm is kept relatively small. Because each tree tends to assign predictions to larger sets of observations (i.e. large boxes), the predictive ability of individual trees is bad. This is why analysts call them weak learners. However, by combining many such weak learners, a ﬂexible, precise and accurate prediction function can be generated (Hill et al., 2020). The BART algorithm has already been presented earlier in this chapter as a ﬂexible technique to detect and explain learning outcome inequalities (Stofﬁ et al., 2021). A reﬁnement of the algorithm also permits the detection of heterogeneous policy effects on the learning outcomes of students. This is showed in Bargagli- Stofﬁ et al. (2019), where it is found that Flemish schools with a young and less experienced school director beneﬁt most from a certain public funding policy. The large administrative data sets provided by educational institutions and governments are well ﬁt for the application of rewarding but computationally demanding techniques such as the BART (Bargagli-Stofﬁ et al., 2019). 16.3.2 Social Network Analysis The aim of Social Network Analysis (SNA) is to study the relations between individuals or organizations belonging to the same social networks (Wasserman, Faust, et al., 1994). Relations between these actors are deﬁned by nodes and ties. The nodes are points of observations, which can be students, schools, administrations and more. The ties indicate a relationship between nodes and can contain additional information about the intensity of various components of that relationship (e.g. the time spent collaborating, the type of communication; Grunspan et al., 2014). Speciﬁcally for education, SNA aims to describe the networks of students and staff and make that information actionable to stakeholders. Applications of SNA include the optimization of learning design, the reorganization of student groups and the identiﬁcation of at-risk clusters of students (Cela et al., 2015). Through text analysis and other advanced analytics methods, SNA can handle unstructured data from school blogs, wikis, forums, etc. (Cela et al., 2015). We discuss ﬁve examples more in detail next and refer the interested readers to the review by Cela et al. (2015), who provides many other concrete applications of SNA in education. As a ﬁrst example, the recognized importance of peer effects, both within and outside the classroom, makes Social Network Analysis (SNA) a particularly useful tool in education (Agasisti et al., 2017;Cela et al., 2015; Iterbeke et al., 2020). Applications of SNA model peer effects indirectly as a component of unobserved school or classroom effects that inﬂuence the (non-)cognitive skills (Cooc & Kim, 16 Learning Analytics in Education for the Twenty-First Century 317 2017). As a second example, SNA has been applied to describe and explain a multiplicity of phenomena in schools. In a study of second and third primary school graders from 41 schools in North Carolina, Cooc and Kim (2017) found that pupils with a low reading ability who associated with higher ability peers for guidance signiﬁcantly improved their reading scores over a summer. Third, other relevant applications of SNA have been in assessing the participation of peers in the well- being, be it mental or physical, of students. Surveying 1458 Belgian teenagers, Wegge et al. (2014) showed that the authors of cyber-bullying were often also responsible for physically bullying a student. Additionally, it was observed that a majority of bullies were in the same class as the bullied students. Moreover, a map of bullying networks isolated some students as being perpetrators of the bullying of multiple students. In cases of intimidation and bullying, a clear advantage of SNA over the usual approaches is that the data does not depend on isolated denunciations from victims and peers. The analysis of Wegge et al. (2014) simultaneously identiﬁes culprits and victims, suggesting a course of action that does not focus attention on an isolated victim of bullying. A fourth example application of SNA is in improving the managerial efﬁcacy and the performance of employees within educational organizations. One way to do this is by identifying bottlenecks in the transmission of information through the mapping of social networks. This can take two forms in the language of SNA: brokerage and structural holes (Everton, 2012). In a brokerage situation, a single agent or node controls the passing of information from one organizational sub-unit to the other. Meanwhile, structural holes identify absent ties between sub-units in the network. In a school, an important broker may be the principal’s secretary, whereas structural holes may be present if teachers or staffs do not communicate well with one another (Hawe & Ghali, 2008). As a ﬁfth illustration, the SNA method has been used to propose a typology of teachers based on the nature of their ties with students and to identify clusters of students more likely to be plagiarising with each other (Chang et al., 2010; Merlo et al., 2010; Ryymin et al., 2008). The ability to cluster students based on the intensity of their collaborations in a course has also been distinguished as a way to prevent fraud. Detecting cooperation between students is one of the key application of SNA in learning analytics (De Smedt et al., 2017). 16.3.3 Natural Language Processing Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an illustration of the ability of computing machines to communicate with human languages (Smith et al., 2020). NLP applications can be achieved with relatively simple sets of rules or heuristics (e.g. word counts, word matching) or without applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques (Smith et al., 2020). Given NLP relies on machine learning techniques, it is better able to understand the context and reveal hidden meanings in communications (e.g. irony) (Smith et al., 2020). 318 K. De Witte and M.-A. Chénier In education, the use of NLP has been shown to improving students’ learning outcomes (Whitelock et al., 2015a) and promoting student engagement. Moreover, NLP systems have the potential to provide one-on-one tutoring and personalized study material (Litman, 2016). The automatic grading of complex assignments is a precious feature of NLP models in education. These may eventually become a cost-effective solution that facilitate the evaluation of deeper learning skills than those evaluated through answers to multiple-choice questions (Smith et al., 2020). By efﬁciently adjusting the evaluation of knowledge to the learning outcomes desired by stakeholders, NLPs can contribute to educational performance. External and open data sets have allowed NLP solutions to achieve better accuracy in tasks such as grading. Such data sets can situate words within commonly invoked themes or contexts, for example, allowing the NLP model to make a more nuanced analysis of language data (Smith et al., 2020). Access to rich language data sets and algorithmic improvements may even allow NLP solutions to produce course assessment material automatically (Litman, 2016). However, an open issue with machine learning implementations of NLP is that the features used in grading by the computer may not provide useful feedback to the student or the teacher (e.g. by basing the grade on word counts) (Litman, 2016). Reasonable feedback may still require human input. 16.4 Issues and Recommendations Despite the outlined beneﬁts and contributions of learning analytics, there are, however, still some issues and limitations. A clear distinction can be made between issues belonging to the technical and non-technical parts of learning analytics (De Wit & Broucker, 2017). In the ﬁrst case, there are the issues related to platform and analytics implementations, data warehousing, device networking, etc. With regard to the non-technical issues, there are concerns over the public acceptance and involvement in learning analytics, private and public regulations, human resources acquisition and the enthusiasm of stakeholders as to the technical potential of learning analytics. We summarize these challenges and propose a nuanced policy pathway to learning analytics implementation and promotion. 16.4.1 Non-technical Issues Few learning analytics papers mention ethical and legal issues linked to the appli- cations of their recommendations (Viberg et al., 2018). Clearly, developments in learning analytics participate to and beneﬁt from the expansion of behavioural data collection. The spread and depth of data collection are generating new controversies around data privacy and security. These have an important place in public discourse and, if mishandled by stakeholders, could contribute to further limiting the potential 16 Learning Analytics in Education for the Twenty-First Century 319 of data availability and computational power in learning analytics and similar disciplines (Langedijk et al., 2019). Scientists are currently complaining about the restrictions put upon their research by rules and accountability procedures. Such rules curtail data-driven enterprises and may be detrimental to learning outcome’s improvements (Groot & van den Brink, 2017). To facilitate collaboration between decision-makers, it is important that the administrative procedures related to learning analytics been seen by researchers as contributing to a healthy professional environment (Groot & van den Brink, 2017). Additionally, public accountability and policies promoting organizational trans- parency may be a proper counter-balance to privacy concerns among citizens (e Silva & Camanho, 2017). The transparency and accessibility of information, by making relevant educational data sets public, for example, can involve citizens in the knowledge discovery related to education and foster enthusiasm for data- driven inference in that domain (De Smedt et al., 2017). It is also important that the concerned parties, including civil society, are interested in applying data-driven decision-making (Agasisti et al., 2017). It can be difﬁcult to convince leaders in education to shift to data-driven policies since, for them, “experience and gut- instinct have a stronger pull” (Long & Siemens, 2011). Just as necessary as political commitment, the acquisition of a skilled workforce is another sizeable non-technical issue (Agasisti et al., 2017). The growth of data- driven decision-making has yielded an increase in the demand for higher-educated workers while reducing the employment of unskilled workers (Groot & van den Brink, 2017). In other words, there is a gap between the growing availability of large, complex data sets and the pool of human resources that is necessary to clean and analyse those data (De Smedt et al., 2017). This invokes the problem, shared across the computational social sciences, of the double requirement of technical and analytical skills. Often, even domain-speciﬁc knowledge is an unavoidable component of useful policy insights (De Smedt et al., 2017). That multiplicity of professional requirements has made certain authors talk of the desirable modern data analyst as a scholar-practitioner (Streitwieser & Ogden, 2016). 16.4.2 Technical Issues Many technical problems must be tackled before data-driven educational policies become a gold standard. Generally, there is a need for additional research regarding the effects of online educational softwares and of digital data collection pipelines on student and teacher outcomes. Additionally, inequalities in terms of the access to online education and its usage are an ever-present challenge (Jacob et al., 2016; Robinson et al., 2015). There is yet relatively little evidence indicating that learning analytics improve the learning outcomes of students (Alpert et al., 2016; Bettinger et al., 2017; Jacob et al., 2016; Viberg et al., 2018). For example, less sophisticated correction algorithms may be exploited by students who will tailor their solution to obtain 320 K. De Witte and M.-A. Chénier maximal scores without obtaining the desired knowledge (De Wit & Broucker, 2017). This is a question of adjustment between the spirit and the letter of the learning process. Additionally, although the combination of administrative and streamed data is in many ways advantageous compared to survey data (Langedijk et al., 2019), the fast collection and analysis of data create issues of data accuracy. With real-time data analyses and reorientations of the learning process, accessible computing power becomes an issue. Meanwhile, the unequal access to online resources and devices plainly removes a section of the student and teacher population from being reached by the digital tools of education. In part, this creates issues of under-representation in educational studies that increasingly rely on data obtained online (Robinson et al., 2015). It also creates a divide between those stakeholders that can make an informed choice between using and developing digital tools and face-to-face education and those that cannot access it or to whom digital education has a prohibitive cost (Bettinger et al., 2017; Di Pietro et al., 2020; Robinson et al., 2015). Lack of access to digital or hybrid learning tools (i.e. a mix of face-to-face and digital education) may directly impede the learning and well-being of students. Indeed, students with access to online and hybrid education can access resources independently to enhance their educational pathway (Di Pietro et al., 2020). In a sense, a larger range of choices makes better educational outcomes attainable. For example, students at a school within a neighbourhood of low socio-economic standing may access a diverse network of students and teachers on electronic platforms (Jacob et al., 2016). In times of crisis such as with the COVID-19 school lockdowns, ready access to online educational platform also reduces the opportunity cost of education (Chakraborty et al., 2021; Di Pietro et al., 2020). However, access is not a purely technical challenge. There are also noted gaps between populations in terms of the usage that is made of educational platforms and internet resources more generally (Di Pietro et al., 2020; Jacob et al., 2016). Students participating to MOOC, for example, are overwhelmingly highly educated professionals (Zafras et al., 2020). Online education may also leave more discretion to students. This discretion has proven to be a disadvantage to those who perform less well and are less motivated in face-to-face classes (Di Pietro et al., 2020). 16.4.3 Recommendations Data-driven policies will require vast investments in information technology sys- tems towards both data centres and highly skilled human resources. Therefore, additional data warehouses need to be built and maintained. Those require strong engineering capabilities (De Smedt et al., 2017). The integration of teaching and peer collaborations within computer systems promises to accelerate innovations in education. One can imagine that, in the future, administrative and real-time learning data will be updated and analysed in real time. The analyses will also beneﬁt from 16 Learning Analytics in Education for the Twenty-First Century 321 combining data from other areas of interest such as health or ﬁnance. Additionally, the reach of analytics programs could be international, allowing for the shared integration and advancement of knowledge systems across countries (Langedijk et al., 2019). Although there is a large practical potential of data-driven policies and educa- tional tools, it is important that an educational data strategy not be developed in and of itself. Unlike what some big data enthusiasts have claimed, the data does not “speaks for itself” in education (Anderson, 2008). Those teachers, administrators and policy-makers, who are working to better educate our children, will still face complicated dilemma appealing to their professional expertise regardless of the level of integration of data analytics in education. Furthermore, to insure political willingness, it is critical that work teams and stakeholders proﬁt from the collected and analysed data (De Smedt et al., 2017). This contributes to the transparency of data use. Finally, although the evidence is still quite thin regarding the beneﬁts of learning analytics, it must be noted that only a small quantity of validated instruments are actually being used to measure the quality and transmission of knowledge through learning platforms (Jivet et al., 2018). Despite this scarcity of evidence pertaining to education, the exploitation of data through learning analytics can be linked to the recognized advantages of big data in driving public policy. Namely, it can facilitate a differentiation of services, increased decisional transparency, needs identiﬁcation and organizational efﬁciency (Broucker, 2016). Generally, the lack of available data backing a decision is an indication of a lack of information and, thus, sub-optimal decision-making (Broucker, 2016). Policies can be better implemented through quick and vast access to information about students and other educational stakeholders. In other words, the needs of students and other educational stakeholders can be more efﬁciently satisﬁed with evidence obtained from data collection (e.g. lower cost, higher speed of implementation). Such evidence-based education is a rational response to the so- called fetishization of change that has been plaguing educational reforms (Furedi, 2010; Groot & van den Brink, 2017). It follows that data analytics should not become a new object for the fetishization of change in educational reforms. Indeed, quantitative goals (e.g. quantity of sensors in a classroom) should not be confounded with educational attainments (Long & Siemens, 2011; Mandl et al., 2008). Rather, data analytics should be developed and motivated as an approach that ensures that there are opportunities to use data in order to sustain mutually agreeable educational objectives. These objectives may pertain to the lifetime health, job satisfaction, time allocation and creativity of current students (Oreopoulos & Salvanes, 2011). In other words, learning analytics pipelines must be carefully implemented in order to ensure that they are a rational response to contemporary challenges in education.

Chapter 17 Leveraging Digital and Computational Demography for Policy Insights Ridhi Kashyap and Emilio Zagheni Abstract Situated at the intersection of the computational and demographic sci- ences, digital and computational demography explores how new digital data streams and computational methods advance the understanding of population dynamics, along with the impacts of digital technologies on population outcomes, e.g. linked to health, fertility and migration. Encompassing the data, methodological and social impacts of digital technologies, we outline key opportunities provided by digital and computational demography for generating policy insights. Within methodological opportunities, individual-level simulation approaches, such as microsimulation and agent-based modelling, infused with different data, provide tools to create empirically informed synthetic populations that can serve as virtual laboratories to test the impact of different social policies (e.g. fertility policies, support for the elderly or bereaved people). Individual-level simulation approaches allow also to assess policy-relevant questions about the impacts of demographic changes linked to ageing, climate change and migration. Within data opportunities, digital trace data provide a system for early warning with detailed spatial and temporal granularity, which are useful to monitor demographic quantities in real time or for understanding societal responses to demographic change. The demographic perspective highlights the importance of understanding population heterogeneity in the use and impacts of different types of digital technologies, which is crucial towards building more inclusive digital spaces.

Zagheni 17.1 Introduction Demography is the scientiﬁc study of populations, including the three fundamental forces that shape population dynamics—mortality, fertility and migration. While these three forces produce the essential events for which demographers have developed a range of measurement methods, each of these processes is also the result of complex individual behaviours that are shaped by multiple forces. Thus, in addition to measuring demographic phenomena and describing macrolevel population patterns, demographers examine how and why speciﬁc population- level outcomes emerge, seek to explain them and understand their consequences. While pursuing science-driven discovery, demographers also inevitably address several interrelated, policy-relevant themes, such as ageing, family change, the ethnic diversiﬁcation of societies, spatial segregation and related outcomes and the relationship between environmental and population change. These and related policy-relevant topics are intimately connected with the three core demographic processes of mortality, fertility and migration. For example, signiﬁcant reductions in mortality rates over the course of the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries imply that individuals across Europe can expect to lead long lives, with an increasing overlap of generations within populations. How does the ageing of populations impact on key social institutions linked to the labour market, pension systems and provision of care? Moreover, how can societies better prepare for these changes? Demography has historically been a data-driven discipline and one that has developed tools to repurpose different kinds of data—often not originally intended or collected for research—for measuring and understanding population change (Billari & Zagheni, 2017; Kashyap, 2021). Demography is thus uniquely positioned to take advantage of the opportunities enabled by the broader development of the computational social sciences, both in terms of new data streams and com- putational methods. A growing interest in this interface between demography and computational social science has led to the emergence of digital and computational demography (Kashyap et al., 2022). This chapter describes how insights from digital and computational demography can help augment the policy relevance of demographic research. Demographic research is relevant for policy makers in several ways. At its most basic level, understanding the current as well as anticipated future size, composition and geographical distribution of a population—whether a national, regional or local population—is essential for planning for the provision of services, for identifying targets of aid and for setting policy priorities. For example, the needs for speciﬁc public services are closely tied to the age structure of a population—populations that have more young people have very different needs than those with a larger share of older people. The impacts of these age structures are also felt in economic and social domains. This shapes not only what services are needed, e.g. schools versus social care for the elderly, but also which issues require priority at a given time. Demographic analyses can also help identify population changes and trends for the future, to identify areas that will emerge in the future as relevant for policy making. 17 Leveraging Digital and Computational Demography for Policy Insights 329 For instance, subnational areas where population is growing quickly have very different needs, and require a different type of planning, compared to those areas that experience depopulation. More broadly, demography sheds light on population heterogeneity along various dimensions and offers insights into the heterogeneous impact of policy interventions on different segments of the population. For example, when considering key demographic trends like ageing, or the impact of climate change on health and population dynamics, questions of the inequality in these impacts across different regions and socioeconomic groups are critical from a policy perspective for identifying vulnerable communities and for supporting them appropriately. Policy makers may also try to favour certain demographic trends, such as through fertility policies or migration policies, in a way that leads to co- beneﬁts at the individual and societal level. For example, policy makers may pursue fertility policies oriented towards helping individuals achieve the desired number of children, which may in turn affect the long-term sustainability of social security systems. 17.2 The Digital Turn in Demography: An Overview Demographers have conventionally relied on data sources such as government administrative registers, censuses and nationally representative surveys to describe and understand population trends. A key strength of these data sources that makes them well-suited for demographic research is their representativeness and popula- tion generalizability. Censuses and population registers target complete coverage and enumeration of populations. In contrast, the types of surveys conducted by and used by demographers draw on high-quality, probability samples to provide a richer, in-depth source of data with a view to testing speciﬁc theories, understanding individual behaviours and attitudes that underpin demographic patterns. While these data sources are critical for demographic research, they also have a number of limitations. These data sources are often slow (e.g. censuses are mostly decennial), resource- and time-intensive and often reactive (e.g. surveys that require asking individuals for information), although in some cases these data are generated as by-products of administrative transactions where individuals interact with state institutions (e.g. birth registration, tax registration). Demographers have developed and applied mathematical and statistical techniques to use quantitative data sources to carefully measure and describe macrolevel (aggregate) population patterns, understand the relationships between different demographic variables and decom- pose changes in population indicators into different underlying processes. Growing bodies of individual-level and linked datasets have also enabled demographers to address individual-level causal questions about how speciﬁc social policies or social changes affect demographic behaviours. The growing use of digital technologies such as the internet and mobile phones, as well as advances in computational power for processing, storing and analysing 330 R. Kashyap and E. Zagheni data, has led to a digital and computational turn in demography (Kashyap et al., 2022). This digital turn has affected demographic research along three dimensions: 1. Advancements in data opportunities 2. Applications of computational methods for demographic questions 3. Growing interest in the impacts of digitalization for demographic behaviours 17.2.1 Advances in Data Opportunities Technological changes in digitized information storage and processing have improved access and granularity of traditional demographic data sources, while also generating new types of data streams and new opportunities for data collection, thereby enriching the demographic data ecosystem (Kashyap, 2021). Some of these new data streams are opened up by the widespread use of digital technologies such as the internet, mobile phones and social media. However, the digitization of information more broadly means that diverse types of digital data sources can now be repurposed for demographic research, ranging from detailed administrative data to bibliometric and crowdsourced genealogical databases, many of which were not intentionally collected for the purpose of research (Alburez-Gutierrez et al., 2019). These new data sources offer novel possibilities, but also come with their own unique ethical and methodological challenges, as we describe in the next section on computational guidelines. In terms of their opportunities, these new data streams can help ﬁll data gaps in areas where conventional data may be lacking and can provide higher-frequency and real-time measurement than conventional sources of demographic data to capture events as they occur. In addition, they provide better temporal and/or spatial resolution that can help ‘nowcast’ and understand local patterns and indicators in a timely way. For example, a growing body of research has used digital trace data from the web, mobile and social media to measure international or internal migration (e.g. Zagheni & Weber, 2012; Deville et al., 2014; Gabrielli et al., 2019; Alexander et al., 2020; Fiorio et al., 2021; Rampazzo et al., 2021). Different types of digital traces have been used to capture mobility processes. Some widely used examples include aggregated social media audience counts from Facebook’s marketing platform (Rampazzo et al., 2021; Alexander et al., 2020) and timestamped call detail records from mobile phones that provide changing spatiotemporal distributions of mobile users (e.g. Deville et al., 2014). Vehicle detection with machine learning (ML) techniques applied to satellite images obtained via remote sensing have also been used to track mobility processes (e.g. Chen et al., 2014). Conventional data on migration are often lacking, and these studies identify ways in which these nontraditional data can help ﬁll gaps and complement traditional sources of demographic statistics. Digital traces of behaviours, such as those from aggregate web search queries or social media posts, can further provide non-elicited forms of measurement of contexts, norms and behaviours that are relevant for understanding demographic shifts (Kashyap, 2021). For example, aggregated web search queries 17 Leveraging Digital and Computational Demography for Policy Insights 331 have been shown to capture fertility intentions that are predictive of fertility rates (Billari et al., 2016; Wilde et al., 2020) or information-seeking about abortion (Reis &Brownstein, 2010; Leone et al., 2021). Social media posts have also been used to study sentiments surrounding parenthood (Mencarini et al., 2019), while satellite images have been used to assess the socioeconomic characteristics of geographical areas (Elvidge et al., 2009; Gebru et al., 2017; Jochem et al., 2021). Beyond passive measurement from already existing digital traces, internet- and mobile-based technologies can also provide cost-effective opportunities for data collection. Targeted recruitment of survey respondents, based on social and demographic attributes such as those provided by the social media advertisement platforms (e.g. Facebook), has enabled research on hard-to-reach groups, e.g. migrant populations (Pötzschke & Braun, 2017), or those working in speciﬁc service sector jobs/occupations (Schneider & Harknett, 2019a, b). Digital modes of data collection also proved invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic, when rapid understanding of social and behavioural responses to the pandemic and associated lockdowns was needed but traditional face-to-face forms of data collection were impossible (Grow et al., 2020). Combining passively collected information (e.g. from social media or mobile phones) with accurate surveys is an active area of research, with great promise in the context of monitoring indicators of sustainable development on a global scale (Kashyap et al., 2020; Aiken et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022). 17.2.2 Computational Methods for Demographic Questions Second, improvements in computational power have facilitated the adoption of com- putational methodologies, such as microsimulation and agent-based simulation, as well as ML techniques, for demographic applications. Microsimulation techniques, which take empirical transition rates of mortality, fertility and migration as their input to generate a synthetic population that has a realistic genealogical structure, have been used to study the evolution of population dynamics. Microsimulation techniques have been used to examine kinship dynamics and intergenerational processes, such as the availability and potential support of kin and extended family across the life course (Zagheni, 2010; Verdery & Margolis, 2017;Verdery, 2015) or the extent of generational overlap (Alburez-Gutierrez et al., 2021), as well as the impact of macrolevel changes, like technological changes (Kashyap & Villavicencio, 2016) or educational change (Potanˇcoková & Marois, 2020)that affect demographic rates, on population dynamics. Agent-based simulation tech- niques build on microsimulation by incorporating individual-level behavioural rules, social interaction and feedback mechanisms to test behavioural theories for how macrolevel population phenomena emerge from individual-level behaviours. Agent- based simulation approaches have been used within the demographic literature to model migration decision-making (Klabunde & Willekens, 2016;Entwisle et al., 2016) as well as family and marriage formation processes (Billari et al., 2007; 332 R. Kashyap and E. Zagheni Diaz et al., 2011;Grow & Van Bavel, 2015). Both these types of individual-based simulation techniques that model individual-level probabilities of experiencing events—when infused with different types of real demographic data—offer ways of building what Bijak et al. describe as ‘semi-artiﬁcial’ population models that are empirically informed (Bijak et al., 2013). Such semi-artiﬁcial models are useful for generating scenarios to examine social interaction and feedback effects or assess the likely consequences of policies given a set of theoretical expectations. These approaches can be used to generate synthetic counterfactual scenarios and are useful to identify causal relationships, especially for social and demographic questions for which experimental approaches like randomized trials are not possible nor ethically desirable. Given that policy making is often concerned with causal relationships, these tools are of quintessential importance, especially when used in combination with data-driven approaches. Improvements in computational power combined with an increasingly data-rich environment have also opened up opportunities for the use of ML approaches in demographic research. The focus on the discovery of macrolevel regularities in population dynamics, its interest in exploring different dimensions of population heterogeneity and the discipline’s orientation towards projection of unseen (future) trends based on seen (past) trends lends itself well to the applications of ML tech- niques (Kashyap et al., 2022). An emerging body of work has used supervised ML approaches that ﬁnd predictive models that link some explanatory variables to some outcome to individual-level longitudinal survey data to assess the predictability of demographic and life course outcomes (Salganik et al., 2020; Arpino et al., 2022). ML approaches have also been used for demographic forecasting (Nigri et al., 2019; Levantesi et al., 2022) and for population estimation using geospatial data (Stevens et al., 2015; Lloyd et al., 2017). While demographic research has been broadly concerned with prediction of risk for population groups or sub-groups, ML techniques offer the opportunity to generate more accurate predictions at the individual level and to better quantify heterogeneity in outcomes or responses. 17.2.3 Demographic Impacts of Digitalization Digitalization has implications for demographic processes as digital tools are used for information-seeking, social interaction and communication and accessing vital services. The importance of digital technologies as a lifeline for different domains was powerfully illuminated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic research has highlighted how the use of internet and mobile technologies can directly impact on demographic outcomes linked to health (Rotondi et al., 2020), marriage (Bellou, 2015; Sironi & Kashyap, 2021), fertility (Billari et al., 2019, 2020) and migration (Pesando et al., 2021), by enabling access to information, promoting new paths for social learning and interaction and providing ﬂexibility in reconciling work and family (e.g. through remote working). This research suggests that access to digital resources (e.g. broadband connectivity, mobile apps) may, for example, 17 Leveraging Digital and Computational Demography for Policy Insights 333 enhance the health, wellbeing and quality of life in sparsely populated areas, by enabling better connectivity, access to services and economic opportunities in those regions. This may contribute to reduce depopulation in certain rural areas of Europe, by making them more attractive places to live and work. At the same time, not everyone may have the same level of access or skills necessary to take full advantage of the digital revolution (van Deursen & van Dijk, 2011; Alvarez- Galvez et al., 2020), and a deeper examination of the heterogeneity of these impacts is necessary to understand who and under what conditions digital technologies can empower. In addition to understanding the social impacts of digital technologies, there is value in understanding the demographic characteristics of digital divides also from the perspective of using new streams of digital data for population generalizable measurement. This is an area where demographers have also begun to make contributions through exploring demographic dimensions of social media and internet use (Feehan & Cobb, 2019; Gil-Clavel & Zagheni, 2019; Kashyap et al., 2020). 17.3 Computational Guidelines Digital and computational demography, which bridges computational social sci- ence with demography, offers several opportunities for addressing policy-relevant questions. We provide guidelines for leveraging these opportunities along three dimensions: methodological opportunities, data opportunities and understanding demographic heterogeneity in the impacts of digital technologies. 17.3.1 Methodological Opportunities Policy makers frequently need to understand the impacts of speciﬁc policies or a basket of policies (e.g. fertility policies that seek to promote the realization of desired fertility), examine multiple scenarios and counterfactuals and assess the heterogeneity in the impacts of speciﬁc policies or social and environmental changes (e.g. climate change) on populations. Computational simulation techniques such as microsimulation and agent-based simulation, which have been increasingly adopted within digital and computational demography, are particularly useful for addressing these types of questions. By incorporating different types of data and forms of population heterogeneity (e.g. differences by educational groups) within simulation models, these approaches can be used to create synthetic populations where individual decisions and behaviours are guided by empirical survey data and/or observed demographic rates (e.g. birth, death or migration rates). Agent-based simulation approaches are especially useful when the focus is on understanding non-linear feedback effects or social inﬂuence effects on behaviours, such as those linked to whether or not to have a child given a wider set of 334 R. Kashyap and E. Zagheni contextual conditions. Microsimulation approaches can help understand the broader implications of a current set of demographic rates for population composition and change, as well as for kinship and intergenerational processes. Microsimulation techniques, for example, can help understand the evolution of kinship availability and support as a consequence of changing demographic rates. By incorporating rates that vary by different population sub-groups (e.g. ethnic groups), microsimulation approaches can help explore questions about the future size and composition of the availability of kin support for different population groups, which is a central question for understanding and adapting in the context of population ageing. These approaches provide the necessary ﬂexibility to create counterfactual scenarios and for an opportunity to link different types of data to understand how different parts of a population system respond—e.g. individual-level changes affect macrolevel patterns, or macrolevel shocks affect individuals. A central challenge when building simulation models is the trade-off between parsimony and complexity. On the one hand, while simulation models allow for ﬂexibility to incorporate different parameters to model complex systems, the inclusion of too many parameters can be counterproductive for interpretability, i.e. for understanding which parameters directly affect the outcome of interest. Another separate concern is that of how best to understand model uncertainty and draw statistical inferences from model outcomes. To this end, different approaches for computationally intensive calibra- tion of simulation models have been applied within the demographic literature. These approaches combine the tools of statistics (including Bayesian statistics) with simulation approaches to help assess model sensitivity and uncertainty (Poole & Raftery, 2000; Bijak et al., 2013). As noted in the previous section, the data ecosystem of demography has been signiﬁcantly enriched with the digital revolution. The availability of a greater variety of data sources and the ability to link them, either at individual or aggregate levels, offer an opportunity to apply tools of causal analysis for observational data, such as quasi-experimental techniques. These techniques can be especially powerful for analysing the impacts of climate shocks (e.g. temperature changes, natural disasters). Such research designs are enabled by the availability of georeferenced data and the ability to link these to other data, e.g. survey or census datasets, thereby facilitating analysis of the impacts of environmental contexts on demographic outcomes (e.g. Andriano & Behrman, 2020; Hauer et al., 2020;Thiede et al., 2022). Computational methods like ML further provide new approaches to harness an enriched data ecosystem. While a lot of social demographic research has been guided by a theoretical perspective focused on analysing the speciﬁc relationship between a theoretical predictor and outcome of interest, ML techniques allow for ways in which a wider range of potential predictors (or features) that are increasingly available in our data sources as well as different functional forms can inform analyses such that new patterns can be learned from data. From a policy perspective, these approaches have the potential to help identify new types of regularities and relationships between variables (e.g. social factors and health outcomes), detect vulnerable population sub-groups and help guide new questions to identify new social mechanisms that can help streamline the targeting and delivery of public 17 Leveraging Digital and Computational Demography for Policy Insights 335 services and social policies (e.g. Wang et al., 2013; Mhasawade et al., 2021; Aiken et al., 2022). The deployment of algorithmic decision-making processes however also raises signiﬁcant social and ethical challenges, such as those about bias and discrimination, whereby algorithms can amplify existing patterns of social disadvantage, as well as transparency and accountability, particularly given concerns about the opacity of complex algorithms (Lepri et al., 2018). Insights from the demographic literature further emphasize the importance of proceeding carefully when deploying these tools. Social demographic research that has applied ML techniques to long-standing survey datasets to predict life course outcomes such as educational performance or material hardship has shown that these outcomes are often challenging to predict at the individual level (Salganik et al., 2020). More work is needed to understand the conditions under which ML approaches can help improve predictive accuracy with different types of social data but also to better evaluate the social and ethical implications and trade-offs in the use of predictive approaches for policy making. 17.3.2 Data Opportunities Policy makers are interested in knowing about real-time developments as they unfold. A key challenge with traditional sources of demographic data, as noted in the previous section, has often been their slower timeliness and lags between data collection, processing and publication. Digital trace data, which are generated as by- products of the use of web, social media and mobile technologies, are often able to more effectively capture real-time processes. The widespread use of different types of digital technologies in different domains of life implies that aggregated forms of these data can provide meaningful signals of population behaviours. For example, the reliance on search engines such as Google for information-seeking means that aggregated web search queries, such as those provided via Google Trends, can help us understand health concerns or behaviours, or fertility intentions within a population. When calibrated to ‘ground truth’ demographic data sources, these real- time data have the potential to help predict future changes and ‘nowcast’ patterns before they appear in ofﬁcial statistics. More generally, new data opportunities provide a system for early warning with detailed spatial and temporal granularity. This can be useful in cases where demographic quantities, like migration ﬂows, need to be monitored in response to a crisis, or for understanding the societal responses to demographic change, e.g. misinformation related to migration or media portrayals of immigrant populations. The value of nontraditional, digital trace datasets for monitoring mobility was highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, where Google mobility data was used to track the impacts of lockdowns and for other forms of public health surveillance (Google, 2022). These data proved useful to assess the potential impact of policy decisions related to partial or full lockdowns, and related reductions in mobility, on lives saved (Basellini et al., 2021). 336 R. Kashyap and E. Zagheni Different types of digital trace data can also provide complementary measures of sentiments, attitudes, norms and current conversations in different formats (e.g. images, text) that are useful for capturing social responses to events, as might be required for policy makers. Online spaces have become salient spaces for social interaction and exchange, information-seeking and collective expression and mobilization. For example, in the area of fertility and family formation, online platforms and forums, such as Mumsnet or fertility apps, can provide a view on prevailing sentiments, concerns and aspirations surrounding parenthood. For other domains, such as for the labour market, when understanding supply or demand in speciﬁc sectors may be necessary (e.g. long-term care), online job search forums can provide insights into these dynamics (e.g. Buchmann et al., 2022). Social media can also provide a useful barometer to track sentiments surrounding immigration or policy changes surrounding immigration (e.g. Flores, 2017) while also providing novel ways to measure the integration of immigrant groups (e.g. Dubois et al., 2018). While digital trace data provide unique opportunities, it is important to ensure that appropriate ethical, measurement and theoretical frameworks guide the use of the data for policy purposes and, where feasible, the data be triangulated and contextualized against traditional data sources. In many cases, aggregated data are sufﬁcient to address a policy-relevant research question, whereas in others more ﬁne-grained, individual-level information may be needed. In cases where aggregated data are insufﬁcient, creating ways to appropriately anonymize the data and safeguard against any risk of harming respondents should remain priority. Given that digital trace data are often not expressly collected for research and collected with informed consent, which is a fundamental principle for survey research, higher standards of privacy protection should be adhered to when using these data. A central challenge with digital trace data remains data access. These data come from and are often owned by private companies, which implies that both their access can often be limited and important details of the proprietary algorithms that shape them may not be known. The landscape of access to digital trace data, via more democratic modes of access such as public application programming interfaces (APIs), has become increasingly more constrained, and in many cases platform terms of use have become more stringent. Policy initiatives to support the development of transparent frameworks for enabling ethically guided and privacy-preserving modes of data sharing between research institutions and private companies are urgently needed to ensure that the potential of these data is realized. When analysing digital traces, it is important to consider demographic biases to better understand who is represented in them and the broader generalizability of the data. These biases may reﬂect broader digital divides in internet access or platform- speciﬁc patterns of use. Triangulation against high-quality traditional data, e.g. from probability surveys, can be valuable in assessing these biases. A separate, but equally important, consideration is that of algorithmic bias, i.e. whereby algorithms implemented on online platforms shape behaviours, such that it is difﬁcult to assess whether observed patterns detected in the data reﬂect actual behaviours or the algorithms. One way to address algorithmic bias is to move beyond passively 17 Leveraging Digital and Computational Demography for Policy Insights 337 collected digital traces towards data collection that involves surveying respondents directly, as we describe next. The increasing adoption of digital technologies has also facilitated online and mobile modes for primary data collection. For example, even in the case of traditional data sources such as censuses, respondents can ﬁll in questionnaires online, although no census so far has shifted completely online as the exclusive mode of data collection. Digital technologies provide cost-efﬁcient modes for survey data collection, although mode and demographic biases of these platforms need to be addressed when using these approaches. A signiﬁcant opportunity for online recruitment of speciﬁc population groups, e.g. migrants or new parents, is provided by social media-targeted advertisement platforms. These are relevant from a policy perspective as they offer new opportunities for data collection that are cost-efﬁcient, timely, and can help overcome some of the limitations of only passively collected digital traces. For example, Facebook allows ads that are targeted towards migrants from speciﬁc countries or language speakers, although the algorithms used to determine whether a user is a migrant are unclear. By conducting surveys on migrant groups where respondents are recruited using these algorithmic targeting capabilities of social media ad platforms, researchers can help audit the algorithms that are used in designing the targeting features of these platforms. While such online surveys offer advantages, they are not high-quality probability samples. Drawing population-level inferences from them requires users to collect demographic information within them followed by the application of de-biasing techniques such as post-stratiﬁcation weighting, where population weights come from a source such as a census or a high-quality probability survey (Zagheni & Weber, 2015). An important direction for extracting greater value from digital behavioural data is to integrate these with surveys—for example, mobile app-based modes of data collection may enable both the collection of self-reported information combined with data on location or movement (e.g. via an accelerometer) or time use. More broadly, data linkage of different types of data—e.g. survey and geospatial data, administrative data with survey data—can help bolster the value that can be derived from data for policy purposes. Linked administrative data, such as that from population registers, are a key resource for demographic research. The Nordic countries (Thomsen & Holmøy, 1998; Blom & Carlsson, 1999), but also others such as the Netherlands (Bakker et al., 2014), have led the way in creating robust data infrastructures and access to these data, and greater policy efforts across Europe to improve linkage of and access to administrative data are highly desirable. 338 R. Kashyap and E. Zagheni 17.3.3 Understanding Demographic Heterogeneity in the Impacts of Digital Technologies Research suggests that digital technologies, by providing cost-effective ways of accessing information, enabling communication and exchange and providing access to vital services, can help empower individuals in different domains of life, including their health, wellbeing and family life, among others. Digital technologies have the potential to provide valuable tools, for example, for mitigating isolation and exclusion of rural or ageing populations, or providing modes for ﬂexible working. While technology has the potential to make signiﬁcant positive impacts, the internet is also not a singular technology, and one where content is often deregulated and user-generated and where the risk of misinformation is also present. From a policy perspective to ensure that the full potential of digital technologies is realized effectively and equitably, it is essential to understand who is using digital technologies and tools (or not), how they use them and who beneﬁts from them. The demographic perspective can be especially valuable for understanding this with the aim of clarifying who and under what conditions technology can empower and when it does not. For understanding demographic differences in the use of digital technologies and functionalities, different data sources are needed. First, a deeper assessment of these differences requires more detailed questions, moving beyond simple measures of internet use within traditional data sources, e.g. large-scale social and demographic survey data infrastructures, to understand how individuals are leveraging technolo- gies for various life domains. Second, administrative data from governments, but also private companies (e.g. mobile phone operators), can provide important insights on the use of digital services by demographic groups. Policy makers should seek to incorporate demographic information (e.g. age, gender, education, ethnicity) where possible in identifying the uptake and impacts of digital tools. Third, digital traces from different platforms can themselves be useful for understanding demographic differences in the use of different platforms in some cases. For example, data from the social media marketing platforms can provide insights on the demographic composition of their user base, although the aforementioned limitations about potential algorithmic bias affecting these data should be carefully considered when interpreting these data. 17.4 Discussion Demography is a highly policy-relevant discipline. As this chapter has highlighted, the new data sources and computational tools available to demographers enable us to provide sharper images of our societies and of sociodemographic mechanisms. This, in turn, ampliﬁes our intuition of the implications of alternative policy choices. While the use of computational approaches, such as those outlined in this 17 Leveraging Digital and Computational Demography for Policy Insights 339 chapter, is clearly valuable, we emphasize that these are best thought as providing complementary and synergistic potential. The most fruitful use cases are likely to be those where both traditional and nontraditional data can be integrated for policy making purposes. Computational modelling approaches that we have described, such as individual- level simulation models, will further beneﬁt from integrating different types of data to help build ‘semi-artiﬁcial’ societies (Bijak et al., 2013), or in other words empirically informed synthetic models, that can serve as virtual laboratories to assess the potential social impacts of different policies. These provide useful tools to assess policy-relevant questions about the impacts of the future course of key demographic trends, such as ageing, climate change and immigration. A distinct opportunity offered by the demographic perspective is the importance of understanding demographic differences in the use of different types of digital technologies and platforms. This is crucial both from the perspective of understand- ing their social impacts and also for more careful use, analysis and interpretation of the data generated by the use of technologies (e.g. digital trace data). The internet is not a singular technology, yet the digital revolution has affected nearly all domains of life. Understanding population-level heterogeneity in digital access and skills, as well as identifying pathways through which digital tools can empower different marginalized populations (e.g. rural populations, older populations), is crucial for addressing population inequalities. Ensuring that no one is left behind in digital spaces is something that needs to be addressed by policy makers, as presently signiﬁcant digital divides in digital infrastructure, as well as digital skills, persist, such as between Eastern and Western Europe (OECD, 2019). Closing these divides will require policy efforts targeting both infrastructure and also digital (up)-skilling to facilitate the digital inclusion of communities. Policy efforts that push for frameworks for data sharing and access between researchers and proprietary datasets to facilitate their scientiﬁc use are crucial for realizing the opportunities offered by new types of data. The involvement of researchers, not only at point of access but also in the process of coproduction of proprietary datasets and for algorithmic transparency, is desirable, to ensure constructive use for scientiﬁc and policy insights. Beyond proprietary data, the data revolution also encompasses administrative data held by governments, which is now increasingly digitized, and streamlined access to these data as well as frameworks to facilitate more effective data linkage between different governmental agencies is crucial. While the data ecosystem has diversiﬁed and become enriched, we stress that more and bigger datasets do not necessarily mean better data. The proper assessment of data quality and reliance on proper measurement should remain core principles when collecting, producing, using and analysing data, which are areas where demographic research has much to contribute. Lastly, it is useful to remember that while better data when used in an ethical way can provide better images of our societies, data itself can only help us identify problems, but does not solve them. 340 R.

Chapter 18 New Migration Data: Challenges and Opportunities Francesco Rampazzo, Marzia Rango, and Ingmar Weber Abstract Migration is hard to measure due to the complexity of the phenomenon and the limitations of traditional data sources. The Digital Revolution has brought opportunities in terms of new data and new methodologies for migration research. Social scientists have started to leverage data from multiple digital data sources, which have huge potential given their timeliness and wide geographic availability. Novel digital data might help in estimating migrant stocks and ﬂows, infer intentions to migrate, and investigate the integration and cultural assimilation of migrants. Moreover, innovative methodologies can help make sense of new and diverse streams of data. For example, Bayesian methods, natural language processing, high-intensity time series, and computational methods might be relevant to study different aspects of migration. Importantly, researchers should consider the ethical implications of using these data sources, as well as the repercussions of their results. 18.1 Introduction Migration has become one of the most salient issues confronting policymakers around the world.

These frameworks have also provided a renewed push to calls from the international community to improve migration statistics globally. The ﬁrst of the 23 objectives of the GCM is about improving data for evidence-based policy and a more informed public discourse about migration. As a matter of fact, many countries still struggle to report basic facts and ﬁgures about migration, which limits their ability to make informed policy decisions and communicate those to the public, but also limits the ability of researchers to contribute to the production of evidence and knowledge on migration. Migration is a complex phenomenon to measure. Population changes generally happen slowly as fertility and mortality tend to impact population dynamics gradually. However, a country’s population structure might change more rapidly due to migration (Billari, 2022). Migration, and in particular international migration, has become increasingly important in shaping population change, especially in higher-income countries, where fertility is decreasing (Bijak, 2010). The study of migration is affected by many challenges (i.e. availability of data, measurement problems, harmonisation of deﬁnitions) (Bilsborrow et al., 1997). Above all, there is a lack of timely and comprehensive data about migrants, combined with the varying measures and deﬁnitions of migration used by different countries, which are barriers to accurately estimating international migration (Bijak, 2010; Willekens, 1994, 2019). Despite the best efforts of many researchers and ofﬁcial statistics ofﬁces, international migration estimates lack quality due to the limited data available in many countries (Kupiszewska & Nowok, 2008; Poulain et al., 2006; Zlotnik, 1987). Migration is a topic widely discussed in several research ﬁelds including demography (Lee, 1966), sociology (Petersen, 1958), political science (Boswell et al., 2011), and economics (Kennan & Walker, 2011). Insufﬁcient availability of quality data on migration can have a high social and political impact, because these inaccuracies might limit the capacity to take evidence-based decisions. The main data sources used to measure migration are censuses, administrative records, and household surveys, collectively referred to as ‘traditional data sources’. These data sources have limitations related to the deﬁnition of migrants (i.e. the dis- crepancy between internationally recommended deﬁnition and applied deﬁnitions in each country), coverage of the entire migrant population, and the quality of the estimates (especially for admin records) (Azose & Raftery, 2019; Willekens, 2019). Moreover, traditional data on migration are not promptly and regularly available. There might be a gap of several months or even years between the time the data are collected and statistics are released to the public. Timely and granular migration data are needed not only for research purposes but also for informed policy and programmatic decisions related to migration. In times of global crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the need for accurate and timely data becomes particularly urgent, but the capacity to collect data from traditional sources can be signiﬁcantly reduced (Stielike, 2022). In the last 25 years, the world has experienced a data revolution (Kashyap, 2021). New data created by human digital interactions increased dramatically in volume, speed, and availability. The data revolution did come not only with the advent of new data sources but also with increased computational power. This, in turn, helped to 18 New Migration Data: Challenges and Opportunities 347 create more sophisticated models to study social phenomena such as migration. New ‘ready-made’ data from digital sources, commonly referred to as ‘digital trace data’ (Salganik, 2019), have started to be repurposed to answer social science questions. Cesare et al. (2018) addressed the challenges faced by social scientists when using digital traces. One of the main challenges is related to bias and non- representativeness, as users of social media platforms, for instance, are not rep- resentative of the broader population and might not necessarily reveal their true opinions or personal details. Correspondingly, understanding how to measure the bias of these online non-representative sources is critical to infer demographic trends for the wider population (Zagheni & Weber, 2015). Once the biases are quantiﬁed, one possible next step is to combine different data sources to extract more information and enhance the existing data. This is an ongoing process in which social scientists have started to combine survey data with digital traces, originally created for marketing, and repurposing them for scientiﬁc research (Alexander, Polimis and Zagheni, 2020; Gendronneau et al., 2019; Rampazzo et al., 2021; Zagheni et al., 2017). The idea of repurposing data is not new to the social sciences (Billari & Zagheni, 2017; Sutherland, 1963; Zagheni & Weber, 2015). For example, John Graunt’s ﬁrst Life Table (1662) was in fact a reworking of public health data from the Bills of Mortality to infer the size of the population of London at the time (Sutherland, 1963). New data sources are a gold mine for migration studies because they offer an opportunity to address the lack of information which hinders this ﬁeld of research. Digital traces (especially social media data) are quick to collect using, for example, Twitter’s or Facebook’s application programming interface (API)1 (for a comprehensive overview of digital trace data for migration and mobility, check Bosco et al., 2022). This allows to know in close to real time how many of the users are in a speciﬁc location and have recently changed their country of residence or are foreign-born, contributing to ‘nowcasting’ migration (e.g. monitoring trends almost in real time). However, digital traces are not always available to academics and practitioners, as they are mostly owned by businesses and may not be fully and publicly accessible. This chapter has two objectives. First, it aims to bring examples of how new data sources and methodologies have been used for studying migration and migrant characteristics. Second, it highlights advantages, limitations, and challenges of digital trace data in migration research. 1 An API is a kind of middleman between data held by a company and a user requesting this data. While the actual database storing the data is protected and not exposed to the outside world, an API provides a link between the requesting user and the server where the data are stored in a database (Cooksey, 2014; Sloan & Quan-Haase, 2017). To be able to connect to an API, a key authentication is usually needed, which is a long series of letters and numbers that identiﬁes the account querying the API (Cooksey, 2014). 348 F. Rampazzo et al. 18.2 New Data in Migration Research As a statistical concept, international migration has been historically characterised by ﬁve building blocks:2 (i) legal nationality, (ii) residence, (iii) place of birth, (iv) time, and (v) purpose of stay (Zlotnik, 1987). As these blocks are complexly entwined with each other, statistical systems use one or a combination of them to gather data on international migrants. The United Nations recommends a deﬁnition of international migration which explicitly focuses on residence and time (UN, 1998), deﬁning a migrant as a ‘person who moves from their country of usual residence for a period of at least 12 months’. Migrants that stay between 3 and 12 months are considered to be short-term migrants. The intended purpose of the UN’s deﬁnition of international migrants is to harmonise data sources worldwide. However, current deﬁnitions of migrants vary between countries. While they all depend on the time of stay outside of the country of usual residence, deﬁnitions applied at the national level differ (i.e. ‘minimum duration of stay in the destination country required for the change of residence in the origin country’ Kupiszewska and Nowok, 2008, p. 58) (Kupiszewska & Nowok, 2008; Willekens, 1994). It has been suggested that digital traces can help reﬁne migration theory and modelling. Fiorio et al. (2017) and Fiorio et al. (2021) highlight the potential of using geotagged Twitter data to investigate short-term mobility and long-term migration. Indeed, the deﬁnition of an international migrant has become tied up with the increase in the number of individuals living transnational lives (Carling et al., 2021). Digital trace data might help broaden or qualify the distinction between short-term and long-term migrants, adding nuances. However, we need to consider that digital trace data do not follow the same deﬁnition as traditional data sources. For example, on Twitter, migrants can be identiﬁed through changes in their location over a period of time, while Facebook provides on their Advertising Marketing Platform a variable that can be used to characterise migrants. The Facebook variable is deﬁned as ‘People that used to live in country x and now live in country y’ (Rampazzo et al., 2021), which refers to the concept of residence and usage of the social media. The Facebook migrant deﬁnition does not account for the time aspect, which creates problems when comparing ofﬁcial migration statistics and Facebook estimates. In Zagheni et al. (2017), the description of the Facebook migrant variable was ‘Expat from country x’, which highlights that the deﬁnition behind this variable may be subject to change. The information on the categorisation of migrant users on social media is limited. In the case of Facebook, the evidence comes from internal and external research. Migrant users might be identiﬁed not only through self-declared public information (e.g. ‘hometown’) but also through inferred information based on their use of the 2 The UN Expert Group on Migration Statistics is updating and revising concepts and deﬁnitions on international migration: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/migration-expert-group/ task-forces/TF2-ConceptualFramework-Final.pdf and https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic- social/migration-expert-group/task-forces/taskforce-2. 18 New Migration Data: Challenges and Opportunities 349 social media (e.g. user’s IP address) (US SEC Commision, 2018, 2019, 2020). Spyratos et al. (2018) conducted a survey of 114 Facebook users asking them to check whether they were classiﬁed by the Facebook Advertising Platform as migrants. The majority of the non-representative sample was classiﬁed correctly as an ‘expat’ despite not having self-reported country of birth or of previous residence on Facebook. Moreover, Facebook’s researchers declared to use ‘hometown’ as a feature for characterising migrants (Herda˘gdelen et al., 2016). On Twitter, migrants are typically identiﬁed through geo-targeting for research studies. However, the number of geo-tagged tweets is limited: only 2/3% of the tweets are provided with a geo-location (Halford et al., 2018; Leetaru et al., 2013). Fake and duplicate accounts might also be a challenge when studying migrants on social media. For Facebook, the percentages of fake and duplicated accounts are reported every year on the US Securities and Exchange Commission documents and are stable at a 11% duplicate accounts and 5% fake accounts (US SEC Commision, 2018, 2019, 2020). Therefore, possible algorithm changes on the measure provided may affect continuity of data from these sources. Case in point, previous work (Palotti et al., 2020; Rampazzo et al., 2021) identiﬁed discontinuities in the Facebook data in March 2019 leading to a drop in the global estimates of the number of migrants active on the platform. Although migrants are not clearly deﬁned in digital trace data, stock estimates of migrant populations seem to be proportionally comparable to traditional data estimates. Zagheni et al. (2017) showed that Facebook Advertising data and American Community Survey data are highly correlated. Moreover, Facebook Advertising data has proved to be faster in capturing out-migration from Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Alexander et al. (2020) show how Facebook Advertising data allowed to provide monthly estimates of the relocation of Puerto Ricans to mainland USA, and subsequent return migration, which traditional data sources were not able to register. The same result is supported by the use of Twitter data (Martín et al., 2020), as well as by monthly Airline Passenger Trafﬁc data used by the US Census Bureau.3 Facebook Advertising Platform could also be used to monitor out-migration from a country experiencing political turbulence, such as Venezuela (Palotti et al., 2020). These examples highlight another important feature of digital trace data: their broad geographic availability. These data can be widely available also in contexts of poor traditional statistics (e.g. low- and middle-income countries); for example, the Facebook migrant variable is available for 17 of the 54 African countries (Rampazzo & Weber, 2020). Facebook Advertising data has also provided insights on migrant integration in Germany and the USA (Dubois et al., 2018; Stewart et al., 2019). Cultural assimilation was studied through the comparison of interests expressed online by the German population and Arabic-speaking migrants in Germany (Dubois et al., 2018). Results shows that Arabic-speaking migrants in Germany are less culturally similar compared to other European migrants in Germany, but the divide is less 3 https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2020/08/estimating-puerto-rico-population-after- hurricane-maria.html 350 F. Rampazzo et al. pronounced for younger and more educated men. Similarly, cultural integration in the USA was investigated through self-reported musical interests between Mexican ﬁrst- and second-generation migrants and Anglo and African Americans (Stewart et al., 2019). The comparison between self-reported musical interests highlights that education and language spoken (e.g. English versus Spanish) are key characteristics determining assimilation. However, these studies are affected by limitations linked to self-reported information and ‘black box’ algorithms estimating interests on social media platforms. Analysis of digital traces can do more than help with estimation of current migration stocks. Non-traditional data sources can also provide insights into migration intentions, migration ﬂows, and more. For example, Google Trends data going back to 2004 has been used to estimate migration intentions and subsequently predict ﬂows to selected destination countries (Böhme et al., 2020). Böhme et al. (2020) complemented Google Trends with survey data to predict migration ﬂows and intentions. Their results are robust, but the authors highlight as a limitation that the predictive power of words chosen might change over time. Moreover, the models had higher performance when focusing on countries where internet usage is high (Böhme et al., 2020). Wanner (2021) used a similar approach with Google Trends data to study migration ﬂows to Switzerland from France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. They found that Google Trends data can anticipate migration ﬂows to a certain extent when actual migration is decreasing in volume. Avramescu and Wi´sniowski (2021) focused on Google Trends searches related to employment and education from Romania directed to the UK, creating a composite indicator in a time series model. They obtained mixed results in terms of predictive power, stressing that knowing the context of the origin and destination countries is important to increase accuracy of the predictions. Despite the challenges, all the authors agree that Google Trends is a powerful source for estimating potential migration. New opportunities might arise also from consumer data from the retail sector (e.g. from basket analysis). For instance, some studies show how food consumption patterns can shed light on integration aspects (Guidotti et al., 2020; Sîrbu et al., 2021). Moreover, companies such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and Duolingo provide reports on their users that might reﬂect migration dynamics. LinkedIn4 and Indeed5 reports focus on economic migration, providing insights on the international job market, while Duolingo6 featuring the most studied language per country shows, for example, how Swedish is the most popular language in Sweden or that German is the top language studied in the Balkans. 4 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202105_02~ c429c01d24.en.html#toc4 5 https://www.hiringlab.org/uk/blog/2021/10/05/foreign-interest-in-driving-jobs-rises-on-visa- announcement/ 6 https://blog.duolingo.com/2021-duolingo-language-report/ 18 New Migration Data: Challenges and Opportunities 351 This section has looked at multiple digital data sources and what they can bring to the ﬁeld of migration studies. Clearly, digital trace data have huge potential given their timeliness and wide geographic availability. However, calibrating new data sources with and validating them against traditional data are essential to use novel sources effectively for migration analysis and policy. New digital data offer possibilities to study a diverse range of topics, including the scale of migration, intentions to migrate, and integration and cultural assimilation of migrants. Given their wide applicability to often politically sensitive topics, such as migration and human displacement, social scientists should critically reﬂect on the risks of results being misinterpreted, or, worse, misused, and how unethical uses of the data could harm individuals, particularly those in vulnerable situations, and infringe upon their fundamental rights (Beduschi, 2017). While many of the applications of computational social science to study are motivated by a potential positive impact on both migrants and the wider society, similar methods could be used to limit freedom and rights of migrants (for a comprehensive analysis of ethical considerations, see Taylor, 2023). 18.3 New Opportunities in Migration Research The Digital Revolution has brought not only new data sources but also opportunities to apply new methodologies or augment research possibilities. Modelling migration is necessary because of the lack of quality in migration data from both traditional and digital sources. Digital trace data needs to be calibrated with traditional data. A natural way of combining data sources is through Bayesian models; indeed, Alexander et al. (2020) suggest a framework to combine migration data from multiple sources over time through a Bayesian hierarchical model. One level of the model focuses on adjusting the bias related to non-representative data (e.g. digital trace data) for a ‘gold standard’ given by survey data (e.g. the American Community Survey). Rampazzo et al. (2021) proposed a Bayesian hierarchical model as well. Their model combines traditional and digital data considering both data sources to be biased. Both frameworks stress that digital trace data cannot be a substitute for traditional data sources and that more accurate results can be obtained through their combination, rather than replacement. Moreover, social media could also be actively used to recruit survey respondents. Advertisements on social media can be repurposed to recruit survey participants to answer a questionnaire. Facebook and Instagram have been used to recruit survey respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic (Grow et al., 2020), LGBTQ+ minorities (Kühne & Zindel, 2020), but also migrants (Pötzschke & Braun, 2017; Pötzschke & Weiß, 2021). Recruiting migrant respondents for traditional sampling strategies is notoriously challenging. However, social media advertising platforms such as that offered by Facebook provide the opportunity for non-probabilistic 352 F. Rampazzo et al. sampling of migrants, through the use of the migration variable.7 Pötzschke and Braun (2017) used Facebook to sample Polish migrants in four European countries—Austria, Ireland, Switzerland, and the UK. In the 4 weeks during which the ads were running, a total of 1100 respondents were recruited with a budget of 500 euro. Moreover, Pötzschke and Weiß (2021) used a similar design on Facebook and Instagram to recruit German migrants worldwide. 3800 individuals completed the questionnaire from 148 countries. The advantage of this strategy is to recruit migrant respondents worldwide in a timely manner and with modest budgets. However, it is challenging to produce representative results as there is no control over who opts in to the survey. This necessitates techniques such as post-stratiﬁcation to make the results more representative of the speciﬁc migrant population. It may be worth noting that similar techniques are also used in traditional surveys (e.g. re-weighting, re-calibration), though with surveys on social media, the lack of a probability sampling results in a necessity to post-stratify. Narratives around migration are usually investigated through qualitative inter- views (Flores, 2017;Rowe et al., 2021). The proliferation of social media has also increased the volume of publicly available text that can be analysed to study general perceptions, narratives, and sentiments on a variety of topics. For instance, Twitter can also be used to analyse sentiments towards migrants and migration (Flores, 2017;Rowe et al., 2021). In 2010, the state of Arizona implemented an anti-immigrant law, the effect of which was studied using 250,000 tweets with natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a difference-in-difference design (Flores, 2017). Analysing the content of the tweets, the author stressed that policies have an effect on the perception of migrants, proving that micro-blogging data are an alternative source for public opinion on migrants (Flores, 2017). In Europe as well, analysis of Twitter text data delivered insights on sentiment towards migrants, describing a situation of polarisation of opinion (Rowe et al., 2021). The data provide an opportunity to track population sentiment towards migration in close to real time and monitor shifts over time. Moreover, focusing on the language used on social media, NLP might be useful to identify migrants and study migration ﬂows (Kim et al., 2020). High-intensity (e.g. weekly or monthly) time series are an opportunity to monitor change and create early alert systems for shifting migration patterns. Napierała et al. (2022) proposed a cumulative sum model to detect changes in trend of asylum applications. The use of ﬂow data and early warning systems could help policymakers in anticipating refugee movements and improve preparedness and management capacities, if handled ethically and responsibly. However, these data and models can be used to make it more difﬁcult for individuals to exercise their rights under the International Human Rights Law. Administrative data sources hold great potential for the study of migration patterns but present speciﬁc issues: for instance, their coverage is limited to the extent that people ofﬁcially register or de- register from countries’ administrative systems; also, administrative records track 7 On Facebook Advertising Platform, it is possible to also create advertisements on Instagram. 18 New Migration Data: Challenges and Opportunities 353 events (e.g. asylum applications), not individuals, and are affected by issues of double-counting and biases that may affect their usability for ofﬁcial migration statistics. Eurostat data on number of applications lodged (which might also be biased) in EU countries could be augmented by including digital trace data in the model, increasing the ability to potentially anticipate future trends. This approach is suggested by Carammia et al. (2022) through an adaptive machine learning algorithm which combines data from Google Trends and traditional data sources. Given their frequency, data from social media platforms and Google Trends could indeed contribute to the early identiﬁcation of shifting trends and, if managed responsibly, to greater capacities of migration policymakers and practitioners to inform adequate and timely measures (Alexander, Polimis and Zagheni, 2020; Martín et al., 2020). Projects like Refugee.Ai and GeoMatch8 propose to use data-driven algorithms to assign refugees across countries and improve their integration prospects (Bansak et al., 2018). Providing examples for the USA and Switzerland, Bansak et al. (2018) describe an algorithm based on supervised machine learning and optimal matching which takes into account the refugee characteristics (e.g. age, gender, language, education) and local site characteristics. The authors bring evidence of an improvement in subsequent refugee employment outcomes (from 34 to 48%). Moreover, they suggest that the model is ﬂexible and can focus on different integration metrics to optimise for. The matching system is described also in the context of the UK (Jones & Teytelboym, 2018). Similar systems have been suggested also in Sweden to match refugees and property landlords (Andersson & Ehlers, 2020). Nevertheless, automated decisions should always be accompanied by a human element of review to avoid risks of algorithmic bias and human rights infringements. There is evidence that also computational methods such as machine learning and neural networks might provide insights on migration. Simini et al. (2021) suggested a gravity model with deep neural network to predict ﬂows of migrants and demonstrated that the model performed better than other models due to its geographic agnosticism. Moreover, convolutional neural networks might lead to new ways of fusing data and master high-frequency data (Pham et al., 2018). 18.4 The Way Forward This chapter has demonstrated how the Digital Revolution has provided new data sources and opportunities to researchers. Timely data on migration are important not only for academics but also for policymakers and practitioners to design data-driven policies and programmes. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed the importance of having timely and accurate mobility data for the study of the diffusion of the 8 See https://immigrationlab.org/project/harnessing-big-data-to-improve-refugee-resettlement/. 354 F. Rampazzo et al. virus (Alessandretti, 2022). However, data from digital traces often lacks a clear deﬁnition of what is being measured. Since such data are obtained from private companies, there may be no information available about the algorithms used to produce migration and mobility estimates, for example, about the speciﬁc criteria used to classify migrants. A clearer understanding of the construction of these measures would allow to include these data sources in models with more precision. In the future, it would be important to create sustainable systems for safe and secure access to the data. At the moment, much of this research is dependent on application programming interfaces (API), which as attested by Freelon (2018) might be closed suddenly. When APIs are not available, web-scraping9 might be a solution, but terms and conditions of the project as well as ethical implications should be taken into account. Initiatives such as the Big Data for Migration Alliance (BD4M),10 convened by IOM’s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre (GMDAC), the EU Commission Knowledge Centre on Migration and Demography (KCMD), and the Governance Lab (GovLab) at New York University, aim to provide a platform for cross-sectoral international dialogue and for guidance on ethical and responsible use of new data sources and methods. Social Science One11 tries to create partnerships between academic researchers and businesses. At the moment, it has an active partnership with Facebook, established in April 2018. The initiative is led by Gary King (Harvard University) and Nathaniel Persily (Stanford University). The goal is to give researchers access to Facebook’s micro-level data after having submitted a research proposal. There are signiﬁcant privacy concerns from this, however, which has created delays in the process. On February 13, 2020, the ﬁrst Facebook URLs dataset was made available; ‘The dataset itself contains a total of more than 10 trillion numbers that summarize information about 38 million URLs shared more than 100 times publicly on Facebook (between 1/1/2017 and 7/31/2019)’.12 A research proposal is needed to apply for access to such datasets; this is the ﬁrst step in analysing large micro-level datasets from private social media companies. Companies also often control the analysis produced with their data. Researchers using companies’ data have to follow strict contracts on its use and seek approval on the results before publication. The Social Science One initiative is interesting in this regard as it comes with pre-approval from Facebook. However, it also highlights challenges of relying on Facebook-internal teams to prepare the data in a non-transparent matter: recently, Facebook had to acknowledge that, accidentally, half of all of its US users were left out of the provided data.13 This 9 Web-scraping is deﬁned as the process of automatically capturing online data from online websites (Marres & Weltevrede, 2013). 10 https://data4migration.org 11 https://socialscience.one 12 https://socialscience.one/blog/unprecedented-facebook-urls-dataset-now-available-research- through-social-science-one 13 https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/10/facebook-error-data-social- scientists/ 18 New Migration Data: Challenges and Opportunities 355 essentially invalidated any work done with the data so far, including that of PhD students. To avoid such issues, ultimately caused by a lack of external oversight, researchers are increasingly calling for legally mandated corporate data-sharing programmes to enable outside, independent researchers to analyse and audit the platforms14 (Guess et al., 2022). Overall, the value of new data sources and new models cannot be underestimated. However, applications of these tools for research and public policy purposes should follow high ethical and data responsibility standards. New data sources and AI- based technologies could help researchers and policymakers improve prediction abilities and ﬁll information gaps on migrants and migration, but the use of these technologies should be closely scrutinised and comprehensive risk assessments undertaken to ensure migrants’ fundamental rights are safeguarded. The purposes of machine learning- and AI-based applications should be clearly communicated, and participatory approaches that empower migrant communities and ‘data subjects’ more generally should be promoted in research and policy domains, with a view to increasing transparency and public trust in these applications, but also provide guarantees for the protection of individual fundamental rights (Bircan & Korkmaz, 2021; Carammia et al., 2022). Many technologies come with a risk of being used to create ‘digital fortresses’15 in which these tools keep out migrants, rather than support them. Hence, social scientists and other researchers should carefully weigh the risks and potential repercussions when using digital traces. References Alessandretti, L.

Chapter 19 New Data and Computational Methods Opportunities to Enhance the Knowledge Base of Tourism Gustavo Romanillos and Borja Moya-Gómez Abstract Tourism is becoming increasingly relevant at different levels, intensifying its impact on the environmental, the economic and the social spheres. For this reason, the study of this rapidly evolving sector is important for many disciplines and requires to be quickly updated. This chapter provides an overview and general guidelines on the potential use of new data and computational methods to enhance tourism’s knowledge base, encourage their institutional adoption and, ultimately, foster a more sustainable tourism. First, the chapter delivers a brief review of the literature on new data sources and innovative computational methods that can signiﬁcantly improve our understanding of tourism, addressing the big data revolution and the emergence of new analytic tools, such as artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML). Then, the chapter provides some guidelines and applications of these new datasets and methods, articulated around three topics: (1) measuring the environmental impacts of tourism, (2) assessing the socio-economic resilience of the tourism sector and (3) uncovering new tourists’ preferences, facilitating the digital transition and fostering innovation in the tourism sector. 19.1 Introduction Tourism is playing an increasingly important role at many levels, and its sector is evolving extraordinarily fast. Thus, the study of tourism, crucial for numerous disciplines, needs to be quickly updated. During the last few years, tourism research is starting to be renovated to keep pace with the ongoing transformations. Nowadays, new data sources and innovative quantitative and qualitative methods offer new possibilities for better analysing and planning tourism (Xu et al., 2020), overcoming many limitations of more conventional approaches. G. Romanillos (\u0002) · B. Moya-Gómez tGIS, Department of Geography, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain e-mail: gustavro@ucm.es; bmoyagomez@ucm.es © The Author(s) 2023 E. Bertoni et al. (eds.), Handbook of Computational Social Science for Policy, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16624-2_19 361 362 G. Romanillos and B. Moya-Gómez Although recent tourism research is exploring and taking advantage of new data sources and methods, there is still a long way to walk on innovation. This chapter aims to provide a general review and some guidelines on the potential use of new data and computational methods to enhance tourism’s knowledge base and promote their institutional adoption and, ultimately, more sustainable tourism. The chapter is articulated around three topics proposed by Barranco et al. and included in a publication of the Joint Research Centre that aimed at collecting the upcoming research needs in terms of policy questions (Bertoni et al., 2022). The ﬁrst one measures the environmental impacts of tourism. Tourism is, directly and indirectly, consuming an increasing amount of global resources, including fossil fuel consumption with the associated CO2 emissions, freshwater, land and food use (Gössling & Peeters, 2015). Therefore, assessing the impact of global tourism activity is one of the most relevant potential applications of new data sources and computational methods. The second topic is assessing the socio-economic resilience of the tourism sector. Tourism economic weight and social impact have become even more evident in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: the crisis has put between 100 and 120 million direct tourism jobs at risk, many of them in small- and medium-sized enterprises, according to the UNWTO (2021). Hence, it is relevant and urgent to explore how new data sources, analyses and models can contribute to planning a more resilient and balanced tourism sector in socio-economic terms. Finally, the third topic is uncovering new tourists’ preferences, facilitating the digital transition and fostering innovation in the tourism sector. How can we better analyse new tourist patterns? COVID-19 may have accelerated some existing changes in tourism trends, so there is an urgent need for quick analyses and predictions for the very near future, as the emergence of nowcasting techniques evidences it. 19.2 Existing Literature Over the past years, new data sources and innovative computational methods emerged to signiﬁcantly improve our understanding of tourism. A summary is provided next. 19.2.1 New Data Sources of Potential Interest for Tourism Tourism is being transformed at an accelerated pace, and conventional data sources often do not reﬂect ongoing changes with enough velocity or spatiotemporal resolution to support the urgent studies to be carried out. In this scenario, new data sources emerge as the raw material to open further explorations in tourism. 19 New Data and Computational Methods Opportunities to Enhance... 363 New datasets can be grouped into different categories according to data sources. Next, a listing of relevant new datasets is provided, classiﬁed according to the nature of the data source and its potential interest for tourism studies, offering some speciﬁc examples. First, we must point out big data from speciﬁc sources of the tourism sector, such as smart tourism cards or information systems in destinations. These sources provide data directly recorded in tourism points of interest, valid to monitor existing activity and analyse current or past trends. In this category, we can also include other data sources such as booking data from transportation companies (especially ﬂight booking data from airline operators), which can help predict tourism activity quickly, feeding nowcasting models. Additionally, we can highlight online accommodation companies and apps, such as Tripadvisor1 or Booking,2 or new peer-to-peer accommodation online services such as Airbnb3 (Calle Lamelas, 2017). These sources can be helpful not only for anticipating tourism demand but also because of the additional information collected from users, such as opinions, ratings, comments, etc. In addition, data with high spatiotemporal resolution allows us to analyse emergent spatial patterns, for instance, in the location of Airbnb accommodation in heritage cities (Gutiérrez et al., 2017). Second, it is remarkable the potential use of GPS datasets. GPS data was actually ranked the top of big data in tourism research (accounting for 21%) and the ﬁrst of device data (58%) according to the classiﬁcation provided by Li et al. (2018). It is essential to use GPS tracks to study tourists’ routes, with an unprecedented level of detail, thanks to the high spatiotemporal resolution of GPS records. In this group, we include the GPS routes recorded by vehicle navigation apps, such as TomTom,4 Waze5 or Google Maps,6 and tracking apps such as Wikiloc7 or Strava,8 very useful when analysing tourism in natural areas, for instance (Barros et al., 2019), or GPS data collected through the emerging tourist mapping apps (Brilhante et al., 2013; Gupta & Dogra, 2017). Third, it is also outstanding the interest of user-generated content (UGC), especially datasets obtained from social networks such as Twitter; photo-sharing social networks such as Instagram,9 Flickr10 or Panoramio11; or apps focused on the location of points of interest, such as Foursquare.12 UGC allows us to explore 1 Tripadvisor website, for more information: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ 2 Booking website, for more information: https://www.booking.com/ 3 Airbnb website, for more information: https://www.airbnb.com/ 4 TomTom website, for more information: https://www.tomtom.com/ 5 Waze website, for more information: https://www.waze.com/ 6 Google Maps website, for more information: https://maps.google.com/ 7 Wikiloc website, for more information: https://www.wikiloc.com/ 8 Strava website, for more information: https://www.strava.com/ 9 Instagram website, for more information: https://www.instagram.com/ 10 Flickr website, for more information: https://www.ﬂickr.com/ 11 Panoramio website, for more information: https://www.panoramio.com/ 12 Foursquare website, for more information: https://foursquare.com/ 364 G. Romanillos and B. Moya-Gómez different tourism dynamics. Semantic analysis of online textual data, such as tweets or travelling blog content, can uncover tourism preferences and trends (Ramanathan & Meyyappan, 2019). Spatial or temporal analyses can also be carried out because most users share data through mobile apps that register GPS coordinates. For instance, Flickr data can be the basis for different temporal analyses, such as estimating tourism demand over a day according to time slots or measuring tourism seasonality in national parks (Barros et al., 2019); also Twitter and Foursquare data can support spatial analyses, such as the identiﬁcation of multifunction or specialised tourist spaces in cities (Salas-Olmedo et al., 2018)(Fig. 19.1). Fourth, search engines’ data constitute a precious data source, such as Google Trends records. Considering that search engines are a leading tool in planning vacations (Dergiades et al., 2018), these datasets provide information on tourists’ interests and plans in advance and can feed models oriented to forecasting tourist arrivals (Havranek & Zeynalov, 2021). Fifth, we must highlight the interest of datasets obtained from diverse infor- mation and communication technologies/devices. The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) provides an increasing amount of Bluetooth data, RFID data and Wi-Fi data (Shoval & Ahas, 2016), which can be helpful to measure, for instance, tourist presence and consumer behaviour over time. Also, in this group, we must emphasise mobile phone data due to its potential use at different scales and for various purposes. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of mobile phone data to monitor changes in tourism or general mobility trends with a high level of spatiotemporal resolution (Romanillos et al., 2021). This analysis may be extended beyond national borders. Nowadays, roaming services have become crucial for tourists, and roaming data allows us to track tourists globally. Lastly, Fig. 19.1 Location of hotel and Airbnb offers (a) and density of photographs taken by tourists and residents (b) in Barcelona. Source: Gutiérrez et al. (2017) 19 New Data and Computational Methods Opportunities to Enhance... 365 credit card datasets should also be included here, given their potential for tourist consumption and behaviour analyses. Finally, more conventional data sources can also provide “new” datasets and opportunities, due to improvements in the quality of data or the way data is shared, in real time, through mobile apps and online services. For example, it is the case of meteorological data. Given that weather is an essential factor in tourism demand, incorporating meteorological variables in tourism forecasting models can increase the predictability of tourist arrivals (Álvarez-Díaz & Rosselló-Nadal, 2010). 19.2.2 New Computational Methods with Application to Tourism Studies In recent years, increased computational capacity, part of the big data revolution, has allowed for faster and cheaper analysis of massive databases by using new analytic tools, such as artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML). Nowadays, tourism analysts may also access an enormous collection of methods for their studies (some are comprehensible; others are like “black boxes”). This section gives a brief and non-exhaustive list of computational methods used in tourism studies, applications and examples. Unsupervised techniques can identify groups and relationships by analysing explanatory variables themselves: no already known responses exist. Outcomes must be validated – are they logic? – tagged and hypothesised. In tourism, clustering techniques were used for detecting the spatial patterns of new touristic accommo- dations (Carpio-Pinedo & Gutiérrez, 2020) or exploring topics of online tourists’ reviews (Guo et al., 2017), factor analysis for uncovering latent motivational and satisfaction variables in tourist (Kau & Lim, 2005)and association rules mining/learning for discovering the most frequent and strong sets of visited places with Bluetooth data (Versichele et al., 2014). Supervised techniques provide models to explain/predict responses. They need complete observations: explained (response) and explanatory variables. Outcomes must be compared to observed datasets. Some models investigate causalities and hypothetical “what-if” scenarios (key results are model’s parameters): linear regressions for inferring causes on tourism industry employment and retention (Chen et al., 2021)or structural equation models (SEM) for modelling the quality of life in a tourist island (Ridderstaat et al., 2016). Other models, especially AI-based techniques, anticipate responses or classify observations (key results are responses): autoregressive moving average (ARMAX) time series models for forecasting weekly hotel occupation with online search engine queries and weather data (Pan & Yang, 2017)or artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) for predicting tourist expenditures (Palmer et al., 2006). Some datasets need to be treated before applying the above methods, especially for reusing datasets from other studies or online sources. Observations must be 366 G. Romanillos and B. Moya-Gómez regrouped into another spatial or temporal unit. While aggregating is a straight- forward procedure, disaggregating data needs the use of other techniques; see estimating visitor data from regional to municipality scope (Batista e Silva et al., 2018). Finally, data and models’ outcomes need to be presented and stand out to the tar- get public. They can be shown using innovative designs (word clouds, cartograms, etc.), such as the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) tourism data dashboard (UNWTO, n.d.). Part of them should be used on digital social networks or in other analysis processes. 19.3 Guidelines This section proposes some guidelines and potential applications of the described new data sources and computational methods to the three main topics mentioned in the introduction. 19.3.1 Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Tourism To facilitate the green transition in the tourism sector, we need a concrete EU roadmap with a solid framework and measurable objectives. Working with key performance indicators (KPIs) can help guide and commit the tourism industry and destinations. This section aims to propose a set of KPIs related to central topics regarding the environmental impact of tourism, focusing on new data sources and computational methods. The ﬁrst topic concerns tourism mobility. Sustainable tourism should be linked to a concept of sustainable mobility, so we propose a set of KPIs that can reveal to what extent we are advancing in the transition to a more sustainable model (Table 19.1). The second topic is tourism land consumption. As a consequence of the growth of tourism activity, land in tourist destinations is progressively occupied and degraded. Essential variables in this degradation process are land occupation, land fragmentation and changes in land-use patterns. We propose a set of KPIs that can improve the monitorisation of these variables, with the help of new data sources and methods (Table 19.2). Finally, the third topic is tourism resources consumption and management. The increasing number of tourists leads to dramatic growth in the consumption of local resources, often leading to unsustainable scenarios. Next, a set of KPIs is proposed to help evaluate tourism resources consumption with the support of new data sources and methods (Table 19.3). 19 New Data and Computational Methods Opportunities to Enhance... 367 Table 19.1 KP Is for tourism mobility Topic KPIs’ description [units] (from low (+)to high feasibility (+++)) Tourism mobility National/International tourist trips made by plane, according to distance ranges [%] (+++) • The lowest the percentage, the lower the environmental impact of the tourism mobility model, since planes are generally the most pollutant transportation mode. Around 40% of tourism emissions are attributed to air travel (Higham et al., 2019) • Mobile phone data can be used to differentiate transportation modes by geolocating call detail records (CDR) and by map-matching estimated routes with transportation networks. Especially effective at the national level but increasingly feasible at the international one with the help of roaming databases (Ahas et al., 2018) • Data from transportation operators, especially airlines • Feasibility: high. Although monitorisation of different mobility and transport dynamics (including tourism) based on mobile phone data is still being adopted in other countries (at a very different pace), data from transportation operators are easily accessible National/international tourist trips made by collective transport modes [%] (+++) • Mobile phone data can be used to differentiate some collective transportation modes from private ones (train, planes or boats) but not correctly others (bus) • Data from transportation operators, car rental companies, etc. • Feasibility: high, for the same reasons explained above Proximity tourism, below a threshold to be deﬁned [%] (++) • Mobile phone data can be effectively used to differentiate tourist trips, analyse trip distances and estimate tourist ﬂow • Trends in the present and the near future can be estimated through data from online accommodation companies and apps, photo-sharing social networks, online accommodation companies and apps and search engines, such as Google Trends records • Feasibility: moderate–low.

In addition, walking is starting to be explored through mobile phone data (Hunter et al., 2021) • Mobile phone data can be effectively used to differentiate trekking and cycling activity • Feasibility: moderate. Accessibility to the mentioned data sources depends on partnerships with private companies (continued) 368 G. Romanillos and B.

Accurate estimations would rely on precise monitorisation of all tourist trips. Some useful data for this purpose (such as mobile phone data) have not been adopted by many EU Member States yet 19.3.2 Socio-Economic Resilience in the Tourism Sector Tourism is an important sector in the EU economy. EU’s tourists spent about $400 billion on trips across Europe before COVID-19 (Eurostat, 2021b). In 2016, tourism was 10% of the EU’s GDP, and it employed 10% of workers in 3.2 million tourism-related enterprises (Eurostat, 2018). However, the tourism sector has high levels of temporal contracts and low retention rates (25%), women employment (~60%), younger workers 15–24 years old (~20%), lower educated workers (~20%) or foreign workers (~1/6) compared to other sectors. The following KPIs can help key stakeholders assess their tourist offers and benchmark with competitors. These indicators could identify socio-economical rela- tionships, vulnerabilities and weaknesses, undeveloped attractions and upcoming opportunities to make a more resilient sector. KPIs’ spatiotemporal dimensions are essential, especially for regions characterised by stationarity. These KPIs should be calculated for several periods, for the whole touristic population in a location (descriptive) or the whole/speciﬁc touristic population in competitors (comparison). This ﬁrst group of KPIs points out socio-economic impacts of tourism in a region that can be used for comparing them with other industries and competitors (Table 19.4). Some of these KPIs measure tourism impacts directly, but others estimate effects through related activities. The second set of KPIs concerns assessing tourist models’ diversity for detecting excess dependencies on a few attractions and tourist proﬁles and their stationarity (Table 19.5). Less diverse territories might be very vulnerable to changes in the tourism demand, wildly unexpected events or incompatible weather, among other cases. 19 New Data and Computational Methods Opportunities to Enhance... 369 Table 19.2 KPIs for tourism land consumption Topic KPIs’ description [units] (from low (+)to high feasibility (+++)) Tourism land consumption Land occupation related to tourism [%] (+++) • In addition to conventional approaches, based on the analysis of satellite/aerial images, new methodologies based on new data sources can help differentiate tourist developments from residential ones and better assess tourism’s particular impact • Mobile phone data and diverse online social networks can be analysed over time to discriminate tourism activity across the territory (Salas-Olmedo et al., 2018) • Feasibility: high.

In addition, food consumption patterns could be analysed based on credit card datasets • Feasibility: high, due to the increasing accessibility to the mentioned datasets Electric energy consumption per capita (kWh/person-year) (+++) • New datasets from electricity companies, which are recording consumption with unprecedented granularity • New electric energy consumer characterisation methodologies are proposed, based on data mining techniques (Pérez-Chacón et al., 2018) • Feasibility: high, for the same reasons explained above Solid waste generation [kg/person-year] and recycled solid waste generation [%] (+++) • New smart waste management systems are being proposed. For example, bins equipped with sensors can register geolocated data on total/recyclable waste (Folianto et al., 2015) • Feasibility: high, for the same reasons explained above 19.3.3 Uncovering New Tourists’ Preferences, Digital Transition and Innovation in the Tourism Sector New information technologies have revolutionised the tourism sector too. This section introduces how new technologies can be used to detect tourists’ preferences and better manage touristic businesses and locations. 19 New Data and Computational Methods Opportunities to Enhance... 371 Table 19.4 KPIs for socio-economic impact of tourism in a region Topic KPIs’ description [units] (from low (+)to high feasibility (+++)) Tourism employment Employment in tourism [%] (+++) • Job portals include a large sample of available positions.

Some payments were paid at home 19.3.4 Analysis of Preference Changes in the Tourism Sector Businesses may use tourist demand data (accommodation booking, car renting) and users’ responses (comments or reviews on products or services) to comprehend the needs of (new) customers to develop and/or to update their products and services and to improve their customer care. While the former may reveal tourist preferences based on their choices, the latter may also highlight some declared unsatisﬁed ones. Analyses of preference changes need benchmarking approaches; competitor performances provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the study location/business. Nevertheless, how may new data and methods aid in the detection of preferences and their changes? Some guidelines are provided next. 19.3.4.1 Searching for Holidays and Activities Many trips or touristic activities begin with an online search. Potential tourists use either general online search engines or speciﬁc touristic planner services. Consequently, data on preferences may be extracted by using autocompletion to 372 G.

These tools can use queries from speciﬁc countries to help segment tourist preferences per origin while planning their holidays. Search query data has been used in many academic studies; Dinis et al. (2019) gathered and summarised some of them into the following topic categories: forecasting, nowcasting, identifying interests and preferences, understanding relationships with ofﬁcial data and others. 19.3.4.2 Text Is a Mine People use words to communicate, and they can publicly share their opinions, recommendations, suggestions and complaints towards touristic attractions in inter- active platforms. An analyst can use text mining techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP), to extract the sense of messages (including emo- jis) and undertake sentiment analyses (converting text into Likert scale values). However, this data may contain brief messages, with abbreviations, because of character restrictions. They must be translated into expanded statements. Also, fake/compulsive users should be dropped to avoid biases. Finally, text mining techniques have difﬁculties detecting ironic tones. 19.3.4.3 What a Beautiful Picture! Some tourists also upload their pictures and videos on digital social networks. Unlike texts, images need to be described before automating processes to extract comprehensible data. Simple methods can summarise colours in pictures (they can explain weather conditions or infer day periods). More advanced ones, available in cloud computing services, can also identify locations, buildings and objects. Thus, pictures transformed into texts and previously mentioned text mining techniques can help determine preferences. In addition, images can include description text and comments that can be used to uncover revealed preferences. Finally, images’ metadata include when and, sometimes, where they were taken. This data can be used for determining spatial preferences of what to take a picture of and from where (viewpoints). 19.3.4.4 Life Is Change Tourists’ preferences can evolve for many reasons (getting older, having children or new job positions or contextual reasons, among others). To detect these changes, it is required to have previous preferences to compare with the new ones and see signiﬁcant changes. The above-mentioned methods can continuously process data, get further insights or update continuous datasets. 374 G. Romanillos and B. Moya-Gómez Notice that many tips and ideas use similar strategies for calculating the KPIs introduced in the previous section. Thus, they may also be reinterpreted to help analyse preference changes or warn regarding new successful tourist strategies in competitive locations by KPIs’ variations. 19.3.5 Digital Transition and Innovation We have seen that using new data sources and computational methods can improve our understanding of tourism dynamics and help plan and develop better tourism policies. However, institutions and companies still have a long way to go to use all these new resources. To accelerate what’s been called the digital transition and foster innovation, we address several relevant questions in this section. 19.3.5.1 What Are the Main Challenges for Increasing Digitalisation and Innovation in the Tourism Sector? How Can Existing Difﬁculties Be Overcome? Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) constitute the majority (around 90%) of Europe’s tourism enterprises (UNWTO, 2020). These kinds of enterprises often do not keep pace regarding technological advances, and are behind large companies regarding the digital transition. Furthermore, it has been estimated that up to 25% of jobs in tourism need upskilling. To maintain the competitiveness of the European travel destinations and satisfy the emerging interests of the travellers towards sustainable travelling options, we need to support the digital transition. Therefore, it is urgent to digitalise services and close the existing skills gap. The private sector essentially provides this support, with most SMEs relying on a few private tech companies. Public institutions should provide similar platforms or foster new public-private partnerships (PPPs) to increase the accessibility to new technologies and facilitate the upskilling process. 19.3.5.2 What Are the Main Difﬁculties in Collecting New Data? What Strategies Towards Effective Data Collection Should Be Put in Place? New datasets essentially come from digital data sources. Fostering digitalisation is, therefore, the ﬁrst step in the way of increasing the collection of data. However, as previously mentioned, digitalisation is mainly led by a few private big tech companies. Consequently, most of the new datasets come from these companies. Two actions could be necessary, then: ﬁrst, to foster new or better deals and partnerships with them as data providers and, second, to avoid an excessive 19 New Data and Computational Methods Opportunities to Enhance... 375 dependence on big tech companies by developing public digital/online platforms and services for SMEs, where the whole ecosystem (companies, institutions and users/tourists) shares data. 19.3.5.3 How to Measure Innovation, Digital Transition and Digital Skills Needs in the Tourism Ecosystem? Some indicators can reﬂect the advance in the digital transition or tourism. For example, quantifying the (1) number of public-private partnerships and the (2) budget allocated to these PPPs could be necessary, given the importance of big tech companies in the digital sphere. In addition, when providing license to new digital services, some authorities are pushing agreements in terms of data sharing, so that companies (in the ﬁelds of mobility, waste management, energy, etc.) have to make datasets public, which could be helpful for the mentioned analyses and models. Quantifying the (3) number of agreements on data sharing would then be another essential indicator. 19.3.5.4 How to Motivate and Monitor High-Quality Data Collection by the EU Member States? The Member States must be aware of the usefulness of new data sources and com- putational methods. All campaigns and initiatives launched to incentivise/facilitate data collection should be supported by services provided in exchange. We need to strengthen the link between sharing data and getting beneﬁts in better analyses and services. It could be a good strategy for incentivising bottom-up data collection initiatives, from users to companies, institutions and, eventually, Member States. Monitoring the advances in data collection by the EU Member States is crucial and should be coordinated. Initiatives such as the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA)13 are essential. As previously mentioned, this reﬂects the almost absence of indicators calculated based on new data sources, in the reports provided by the Member States. However, annual reports should be replaced by constantly open and updated online platforms that could also inform not only about results but also about Member States’ progress, strategies, initiatives or agreements, regarding the digital transition. Although recent tourism research is exploring and taking advantage of new data sources and methods, there is still a long way to walk on innovation in institutions at 13 The Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) is a standard statistical framework and the main tool for the economic measurement of tourism. It has been developed by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel- opment (OECD), the Statistical Ofﬁce of the European Commission (Eurostat) and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). More information: https://www.oecd.org/cfe/tourism/ tourismsatelliteaccountrecommendedmethodologicalframework.htm 376 G. Romanillos and B. Moya-Gómez the level of the European Union and national, regional or municipal levels. This fact is evidenced in the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) 2019 (Eurostat, 2019) Annex II. All countries indicate the most relevant data sources used to calculate the related indicators for each TSA table. Annex II shows the almost absence of nontraditional or new data sources, such as “mobile positioning data” or “other Big Data sources”. 19.4 The Way Forward This chapter brieﬂy discusses the potential of new data and computational methods to help stakeholders better understand and plan tourism. The above KPIs might be measured almost everywhere in Europe and other regions of the world, in a wide range of periods and spatial scales, since they can be fed with similar data. If data sources are different, data must be reformatted to a common structure in comparative studies. Therefore, due to data’s total/partial interoperability, KPIs can be measured for several locations or industries, including competitors, and undertake comparative studies. Data, methods and KPIs proposed in this chapter have some limitations. They do not cover all the analyses needed regarding the complex tourism sector. Therefore, other traditional measurement techniques and data sources (surveys) are still required and used complementarily. Moreover, new techniques can create new problems. Some potential issues are: • Dependency on the digital footprint. A signiﬁcant number of tourists or tourist attractions may leave no or only a few digital footprints. The digital divide and digital infrastructure supply in the analysed locations must be considered while measuring and understanding KPIs’ results. Traditional studies must help determine which tourism segments might be well represented by digital data and help ﬁx biases. • User’s privacy. It must be guaranteed while estimating tourism KPIs and developing new products and strategies (Hall & Ram, 2020). KPIs should reveal the necessary information on a given topic without interfering with people’s personal life and without explicitly fostering changes in their preferences. People can feel insecure if they feel constantly and unconsciously watched or worried that their data may be used against them. However, people may also agree to donate data to feed purely anonymous databases for good by an explicit agreement and fair and transparent methods. • Data availability/ownership. Private companies own valuable data for analysing tourism. They usually restrict access to data since it might be a big part of their business. However, some have already released datasets worldwide or in events like hackathons and datathons. These actions have created new businesses/products and brought new insights into the tourism processes. It is necessary to explore win-win strategies among businesses and the public sector to access relevant data while keeping privacy and industrial know-how permanently (Robin et al., 2016). 19 New Data and Computational Methods Opportunities to Enhance... 377 Finally, the above KPIs are just values. Although some of those values seem to be easily interpretable (higher values are better than lower ones in some KPIs), they usually need some comparative or normative framework. These ranges must also be deﬁned. References Ahas, R., Silm, S., & Tiru, M. (2018). Measuring transnational migration with roaming datasets.

Chapter 20 Computational Social Science for Policy and Quality of Democracy: Public Opinion, Hate Speech, Misinformation, and Foreign Inﬂuence Campaigns Joshua A. Tucker Abstract The intersection of social media and politics is yet another realm in which Computational Social Science has a paramount role to play. In this review, I examine the questions that computational social scientists are attempting to answer – as well as the tools and methods they are developing to do so – in three areas where the rise of social media has led to concerns about the quality of democracy in the digital information era: online hate; misinformation; and foreign inﬂuence campaigns. I begin, however, by considering a precursor of these topics – and also a potential hope for social media to be able to positively impact the quality of democracy – by exploring attempts to measure public opinion online using Computational Social Science methods. In all four areas, computational social scientists have made great strides in providing information to policy makers and the public regarding the evolution of these very complex phenomena but in all cases could do more to inform public policy with better access to the necessary data; this point is discussed in more detail in the conclusion of the review. 20.1 Introduction The advent of the digital information age – and, in particular, the stratospheric rise in popularity of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok – has led to unprecedented opportunities for people to share information and content with one another in a much less mediated fashion that was ever possible previously. These opportunities, however, have been accompanied by a myriad of new concerns and challenges at both the individual and societal levels, including threats to systems of democratic governance (Tucker et al., 2017). Chief among these are the rise of hateful and abusive forms of communication on these J. A. Tucker (\u0002) New York University, New York, NY, USA e-mail: joshua.tucker@nyu.edu © The Author(s) 2023 E. Bertoni et al. (eds.), Handbook of Computational Social Science for Policy, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16624-2_20 381 382 J. A. Tucker platforms, the seemingly unchecked spread of mis- and disinformation,1 and the ability of malicious political actors, including, and perhaps most notably, foreign adversaries, to launch coordinated inﬂuence attacks in an attempt to hijack public opinion. Concurrently, the rise of computing power and the astonishing developments in the ﬁelds of information storage and retrieval, text-as-data, and machine learning have given rise to a whole new set of tools – collectively known as Computational Social Science – that have allowed scholars to study the digital trace data left behind by the new online activity of the digital information era in previously unimaginable ways. These Computational Social Science tools can enable scholars to characterize and describe the newly emerging phenomena of the digital information era but also, in the case of the more malicious of these new phenomena, to test ways to mitigate their prevalence and impact. Accordingly, this chapter of the handbook summarizes what we have learned about the potential for Computational Social Science tools to be used to address the three of these threats identiﬁed above: hate speech, mis- /disinformation, and foreign coordinated inﬂuence campaigns. As these topics are set against the backdrop of inﬂuencing public opinion, I begin with an overview of how Computational Social Science techniques can be harnessed to measure public opinion. Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of the paramount importance for any of these efforts of ensuring that independent researchers – that is, researchers not employed by the platforms themselves – have access to the data necessary to continue and build upon the research described in the chapter, as well as to inform, and ultimately facilitate, public regulatory policy. All of these areas – using Computational Social Science to measure pub- lic opinion, and to detect, respond to, and possibly even remove hate speech, misinformation, and foreign inﬂuence campaigns – have important public policy connotations. Using social media to measure public opinion offers the possibility for policy makers to have additional tools at their disposal for gauging the opinions regarding, and salience of, issues among the general public, ideally helping to make governments more responsive to the public. Hate speech and misinformation together form the crux of the debate over “content moderation” on platforms, and Computational Social Science can provide the tools necessary to implement policy makers’ proscriptions for addressing these potential harms but also, equally importantly, for understanding the actual nature of the problems that they are trying to address. Finally, foreign coordinated inﬂuence campaigns, regardless of the extent to which they actually inﬂuence politics in other countries, can rightly be conceived of as national security threats when foreign powers attempt to undermine the quality and functioning of democratic institutions. Here again, Computational Social Science has an important role to play in identifying such campaigns but also 1 I follow Tucker et al. (2018) and Born and Edgington (2017) in deﬁning misinformation online as information that is factually incorrect but is spread by people who are unaware that the information is incorrect; disinformation, by contrast, is knowingly spread false information. 20 Computational Social Science for Policy and Quality of Democracy:... 383 in terms of attempting to measure the goals, strategies, reach, and ultimate impact of such campaigns.2 In the review that follows, I focus almost exclusively on publications and papers from the last 3–4 years. To be clear, this research all builds on very important prior work that will not be covered in the review.3 In addition, in the time it has taken to bring this piece to publication, there have undoubtedly been many new and important contributions to the ﬁeld that will not be addressed here. But hopefully the review is able to provide readers with a fairly up to date sense of the promises of – and challenges facing – new approaches from Computational Social Science to the study of democracy and its challenges. 20.2 Computational Social Science and Measuring Public Opinion One of the great lures of social media was that it would lead to new ways to analyse and measure public opinion (Barberá & Steinert-Threlkeld, 2020; Klašnja et al., 2017). Traditional survey-based methods of measuring public opinion of course have all sort of important advantages, to say nothing of a 70-year pedigree of developing appropriate methods around sampling and estimation. There are, however, drawbacks too: surveys are expensive; there are limits to how many anyone can run; they are dependent on appropriate sampling frames; they rely on an “artiﬁcial” environment for measuring opinion and are correspondingly subject to social desirability bias; and, perhaps most importantly, they can only measure opinions for the questions pollsters decide to ask. Social media, on the other hand, holds open the promise of inexpensive, real-time, ﬁnely grained time-series measurement of people’s opinions in a non-artiﬁcial environment where there is no sense of being observed for a study or needing to respond to a pollster (Beauchamp, 2017). Moreover, analysis can also be retrospective, going back in time to study the evolution of opinion on a topic for which one might not thought to have previously asked questions in public opinion surveys.4 The way the ﬁeld has developed has not, however, been in a way that uses social media to mimic the traditional public opinion polling approach of an omnibus survey 2 See as well Chap. 22, “Political Analysis, Misinformation, and Democracy” of Mapping the Demand Side of Computational Social Science for Public Policy (Bertoni et al., 2022). 3 For longer, prior reviews of related literature, see Tucker et al. (2018) and Persily and Tucker (2020b). 4 More generally, if we can extract public opinion data from existing stores of social media data, we can retrospectively examine public opinion on any topic, which is of course impossible in traditional studies of public opinion via survey questionnaires, which are by deﬁnition limited to the questions asked in the past. Of course, social media data vary in the extent to which past data are available for retrospective analysis, but platforms where most posts are public (e.g. Twitter, Reddit) offer important opportunities in this regard. 384 J. A. Tucker that presents attitudes among the public across a large number of topics on a regular basis. Instead, we have seen two types of Computational Social Science studies take centre stage: studies that examine attitudes over time related to one particular issue or topic and studies that attempt to use social media data to assess the popularity of political parties and politicians, often in an attempt to predict election outcomes.5 The issue-based studies generally involve a corpus of social media posts (usually tweets) being collected around a series of keywords related to the issue in question and then sentiment analysis (usually positive or negative sentiment towards the issue) being measured over a period of time. Studies of this nature have examined attitudes towards topics such as Brexit (Georgiadou et al., 2020), immigration (Freire-Vidal & Graells-Garrido, 2019), refugees (Barisione et al., 2019), austerity (Barisione & Ceron, 2017), COVID-19 (Dai et al., 2021; Gilardi et al., 2021;Lu et al., 2021), the police (Oh et al., 2021), gay rights (Adams-Cohen, 2020), and climate change (Chen et al., 2021b). Studies of political parties and candidates follow similar patterns although sometimes using engagement such as “likes” to measure popularity instead of sentiment analysis. Recent examples include studies that have been conducted in countries including Finland (Vepsäläinen et al., 2017), Spain (Bansal & Srivastava, 2019;Grimaldiet al., 2020), and Greece (Tsakalidis et al., 2018).6 Of course, studying public opinion using computational social methods and social media data is not without its challenges. First and foremost is the question of representativeness: whose opinions are being measured when we analyse social media data? There are two layers of concern here: whether the people whose posts are being analysed are representative of the overall users of the platform but also whether the overall users of the platform are representative of the population of interest (Klašnja et al., 2017). If the goal is simply to ascertain the opinions of those using the platform, then the latter question is less problematic. Of course, the “people” part of the question can also be problematic, as social media accounts can also be “bots”, accounts that are automated to produce content based on algorithms as opposed to having a one-to-one relationship to a human being, although this varies by platform (Grimaldi et al., 2020; Sanovich et al., 2018;Yang et al., 2020). Another problem for representativeness can arise when signiﬁcant portions of the population lack internet access, or when people are afraid to voice their opinions online due to fear of state repression (Isani, 2021). Even if the question of representativeness can be solved and/or an appropriate population of interest identiﬁed, the original question of how to extract opinions out of unstructured text data still remains. Here, however, we have seen great strides by computational social scientists in developing innovative methods. Loosely speaking, 5 The one exception has been a few studies that attempt to use the discussion of issues as a way of teasing out who is leading the public conversation on important policy issues, elites or the mass public (Barberá et al., 2019; Gilardi et al., 2021, 2022). These studies, however, tend to measure attention to multiple topics and issues, but not opinions in regard to these issues. 6 The Greek case involved a referendum, as opposed to a parliamentary election. For a meta-review of 74 related studies, see Skoric et al. (2020). 20 Computational Social Science for Policy and Quality of Democracy:... 385 we can identify two basic approaches. The ﬁrst set of methods are characterized by a priori identifying text that is positively or negatively associated with a certain topic and then simply tracking the prevalence (e.g. counts, ratios) of these words over time (Barisione et al., 2019; Georgiadou et al., 2020; Gilardi et al., 2022). For example, in Siegel and Tucker (2018), we took advantage of the fact that when discussing ISIS in Arabic, the term “Islamic State” suggests support for the organization, while the derogatory term “Daesh” is used by those opposed to ISIS. Slight variations on this approach can involve including emojis as well as words (Bansal & Srivastava, 2019) or focusing on likes instead of text (Vepsäläinen et al., 2017). The more popular approach, however, is to rely on one of the many differ- ent machine learning approaches to try to classify sentiment. These approaches include nonnegative matrix factorization (Freire-Vidal & Graells-Garrido, 2019), deep learning (Dai et al., 2021), convolutional and recurrent neural nets (Wood- Doughty et al., 2018), and pre-trained language transformer models (Lu et al., 2021; Terechshenko et al., 2020); many papers also compare a number of different supervised machine learning models and select the one that performs best (Adams- Cohen, 2020;Grimaldiet al., 2020; Tsakalidis et al., 2018). While less common, some studies use unsupervised approaches for stance relying on networks and activity to cluster accounts (Darwish et al., 2019). Closely related to these latter approaches are network-based models that are not focused on positive or negative sentiment towards a particular topic, but rather attempt to place different users along a latent dimension of opinion, such as partisanship (Barberá, 2015; Barberá et al., 2015) or attitudes towards climate change (Chen et al., 2021b). With this basic background on the ways in which Computational Social Science can be utilized to measure public opinion using social media data, in the remainder of this chapter, I examine the potential of Computational Social Science to address three pernicious forms of online behaviour that have been identiﬁed as threats to the quality of democracy: hate speech, misinformation, and foreign inﬂuence campaigns. 20.3 Computational Social Science and Hate Speech The rise of Web 2.0 brought with it the promise of a more interactive internet, where ordinary users could be contributing content in near real time (Ackland, 2013). Social media in many ways represented the apex of this trend, with the most dominant tech companies becoming those that did not actually produce content, but instead provided platforms on which everyone could create content. While removing the gatekeepers from the content production process has many attractive features from the perspective of democratic participation and accountability, it also has its downsides – perhaps no more obvious than the fact that gatekeepers could also play a role in policing online hate. As that observation became increasingly obvious, a wave of scholarship has developed utilizing Computational Social Science tools to 386 J. A. Tucker attempt to characterize the extent of the problem, measure its impact, and assess the effectiveness of various countermeasures (Siegel, 2020). Attempts to measure the prevalence and diffusion of hate speech have been at the forefront of this work, including studies that take place on single platforms (Gallacher & Bright, 2021;He et al., 2021;Mathew et al., 2018) and those on multiple platforms (Gallacher, 2021; Velásquez et al., 2021) with the latter including studies of what happens to user’s hate speech on one platform when they are banned from another one (Ali et al., 2021; Mitts, 2021). Other studies have focused on more speciﬁc topics, such as the amount of hate speech produced by bots as opposed to humans (Albadi et al., 2019), examining whether there are serial producers of hate in Italy (Cinelli et al., 2021) or hate speech targeted at elected ofﬁcials and politicians (Greenwood et al., 2019; Rheault et al., 2019; Theocharis et al., 2020). A second line of research has involved attempting to ascertain both the causes and effects of hate speech and in particular the relationship between ofﬂine violence, including hate crimes, and online hate speech. For example, a number of papers have examined the rise in online anti-Muslim hate speech on Twitter and Reddit following terrorist attacks in Paris (Fischer-Preßler et al., 2019; Olteanu et al., 2018) and Berlin (Kaakinen et al., 2018). Conversely, other studies have examined the relationship between hate speech on social media and hate crimes (Müller &Schwarz, 2021; Williams et al., 2020). Other work examines the relationship between political developments and the rise of hate speech, such as the arrival of a boat of refugees in Spain (Arcila-Calderón et al., 2021). Closely related are studies, primarily of an experimental nature, that attempt to measure the impact of being exposed to incivility (Kosmidis & Theocharis, 2020) or hate speech on outcomes such as prejudice (Soral et al., 2018) or fear (Oksanen et al., 2020). A third line of research has focused on attempts to not just detect but also to counter hate speech online. The main approach here has been ﬁeld experiments, where researchers detect users of hate speech on Twitter, use “sock puppet” accounts to deliver some sort of message designed to reduce the use of hate speech using an experimental research design, and then monitor users’ future behaviour. Stimuli tested have involved varying the popularity, race, and partisanship of the account delivering the message (Munger, 2017, 2021), embedding the exhortation in religious (Islamic) references (Siegel & Badaan, 2020), and threats of suspension from the platform (Yildirim et al., 2021). Researchers have also employed survey experiments to measure the impact of counter-hate speech (Sim et al., 2020)as well as observational studies, such as Garland et al. (2022)’s study of 180,000 conversations on German political Twitter. Computational Social Science sits squarely at the root of all of this research, as any study that involves detecting hate speech at scale needs to rely on automated methods.7 There are essentially two different research strategies employed by researchers. The ﬁrst is to utilize dictionary methods – identifying hateful words that 7 Some studies of hate speech do avoid the need to identify hate speech at scale by the use of surveys and survey experiments (Kaakinen et al., 2018; Kunstetal., 2021; Oksanen et al., 2020; 20 Computational Social Science for Policy and Quality of Democracy:... 387 are either available in existing databases or identiﬁed by the researchers conducting the study and then collecting posts that contain those particular terms (Arcila- Calderón et al., 2021; Greenwood et al., 2019;Mathew et al., 2018; Mitts, 2021; Olteanu et al., 2018). The second option is to rely on supervised machine learning. As with the study of opinions and sentiment generally, we can see a wide range of supervised ML methods employed, including pre-trained language models based on the BERT architecture (Cinelli et al., 2021; Gallacher, 2021; Gallacher & Bright, 2021;He et al., 2021), SVM models (Rheault et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2019), random forest (Albadi et al., 2019), doc2vec (Garland et al., 2022), and logistic regression with L1 regularization (Theocharis et al., 2020). Siegel et al. (2021) combine dictionary methods with supervised machine learning to screen out false positives from the dictionary methods using a naive Bayes classiﬁer and, signaling a potential warning for the dictionary methods, ﬁnd that large numbers (in many cases approximately half) of the tweets identiﬁed by the dictionary methods are removed by the supervised machine learning approach as false positives. Unsupervised machine learning is less prevalent in this research – other than for identifying subtopics in a general area in which to look for the relative prevalence of hate speech (e.g. Arcila-Calderón et al. 2021, (refugees), Velásquez et al. 2021 (COVID-19), Fischer-Preßler et al. 2019 (terrorist attacks)) – although Rasmussen et al. (2021) propose what they call a “super-unsupervised” method for hate speech detection that relies on word embeddings and does not require human-coded training data. One important development of note is that in recent years it is becoming more and more possible to ﬁnd studies of hate speech involving language other than English, including Spanish (Arcila-Calderón et al., 2021), Italian (Cinelli et al., 2021), German (Garland et al., 2022), and Arabic (Albadi et al., 2019;Siegel & Badaan, 2020). Other important Computational Social Science innovations in the ﬁeld include matching accounts across multiple platforms to observe how the same people behave on multiple platforms, including how content moderation actions on one platform can impact hate speech on another (Mitts, 2021) and network analyses of the spread of hateful content (Velásquez et al., 2021). Finally, it is important to remember that any form of identiﬁcation of hate speech that relies on humans to classify speech as hateful or not is subject to whatever biases underlie human coding (Ross et al., 2017), which includes all supervised machine learning methods. One warning here can be found in Davidson et al. (2019), who demonstrate that a number of hate speech classiﬁers are more likely to classify tweets written in what the authors call “African-American English” as hate speech than tweets written in standard English. Sim et al., 2020; Soral et al., 2018), or creating one’s own platform in which to observe participant behavior (Álvarez-Benjumea & Winter, 2018, 2020). 388 J. A. Tucker 20.4 Computational Social Science and Misinformation In the past 6 years or so, we have witnessed a very signiﬁcant increase in research related to misinformation online.8 One can conceive of this ﬁeld as attempting to answer six closely related questions, roughly in order of time sequence: 1. Who produces misinformation? 2. Who is exposed to misinformation? 3. Conditional on exposure, who believes misinformation? 4. Conditional on belief, is it possible to correct misinformation? 5. Conditional on exposure, who shares misinformation? 6. Through production and sharing, how much misinformation exists online/on platforms? Computational Social Science can be used to shed light on any of these questions but is particularly important for questions 2, 5, and 6: who is exposed, who shares, and how much misinformation exists online?9 To answer these questions, Computational Social Science is employed in one of two ways: to trace the spread of misinformation or to identify misinformation. The former of these is a generally easier task than the latter, and studies that employ Computational Social Science in this way generally follow the following pattern. First, a set of domains or news articles are identiﬁed as being false. In the case of news articles, researchers generally turn to fact checking organizations for lists of articles that have been previously identiﬁed as being false such as Snopes or PolitiFact (Allcott et al., 2019; Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017;Shao et al., 2018). Two points are worth noting here. First, this means that such studies are limited to countries in which fact checking organizations exist. Second, such studies are also limited to articles that fact checking organizations have chosen to check (which might be subject to their own organizational biases).10 For news domains, researchers generally rely either on outside organization that ranks the quality of news domains, such as NewsGuard (Aslett et al., 2022), or else lists of suspect news sites published by journalists or other scholars (Grinberg et al., 2019; Guess et al., 2019). Scholars have also found other creative ways to ﬁnd sources of suspect information, such as public pages on Facebook associated with conspiracy theories (Del Vicario et al., 2016) or videos that were removed from YouTube 8 For reviews, see Guess and Lyons (2020), Tucker et al. (2018), and Van Bavel et al. (2021). 9 The questions of who believes misinformation and how to correct misinformation are of course crucially important but are generally addressed using survey methodology (Aslett et al., 2022). For a review of the literature on correcting misinformation, see Wittenberg and Berinsky (2020); for more recent research on the value of “accuracy nudges” and games designed to inoculate users against believing false news, see Pennycook et al. (2021) and Maertens et al. (2021), respectively. 10 For an exception to this approach, however, see Godel et al. (2021) which relies on an automated method to select popular articles from ﬁve news streams (three of which are low-quality news streams) in real time and then send those articles to professional fact checkers for evaluation as part of the research pipeline. 20 Computational Social Science for Policy and Quality of Democracy:... 389 (Knuutila et al., 2020). Once the list of suspect domains or articles are identiﬁed, the Computational Social Science component of researching the spread comes from interacting with and/or scraping online information to track where these links are found. This can be as simple as querying an API, and as complicated as developing methods to track the spread of information.11 The second – and primary – use of Computational Social Science techniques in the study of misinformation is the arguably more difﬁcult task of using Com- putational Social Science to identify content as misinformation. As might be expected, using dictionary methods to do so is much more difﬁcult than for tasks such as identifying hate speech or ﬁnding posts about a particular topic or issue. Accordingly, when we do see dictionary methods in the study of misinformation, they are generally employed in order to identify posts about a speciﬁc topic (e.g. Facebook ads related to a Spanish general election in Cano-Orón et al., 2021) that are then coded by hand; Gorwa (2017) and Oehmichen et al. (2019) follow similar procedures of hand labelling small numbers of posts/accounts as examples of misinformation in Poland and the United States, respectively. Although still a very challenging computational task, recent research has begun to attempt to use machine learning to build supervised classiﬁers to identify misinformation on Twitter using SVMs (Bojjireddy et al., 2021), BERT embeddings (Micallef et al., 2020), and ensemble methods (Al-Rakhami & Al-Amri, 2020). Jagtap et al. (2021) comparatively test a variety of different supervised classiﬁers to identify misinformation in YouTube comments. Jachim et al. (2021) have built a tool based on unsupervised machine learning called “Troll Hunter” that while not identifying misinformation per se can be used to surface narratives across multiple posts online that might form the basis of disinformation campaign. Karduni et al. (2019) also incorporate images into their classiﬁer. Closely related, other studies have sought to harness network analysis to identify misinformation online. For example, working with leaked documents that identify actors paid by the South Korean government, Keller et al. (2020) show how retweet and co-tweet networks can be used to identify possible purveyors of misinformation. Zhu et al. (2020) utilize a “heuristic greedy algorithm” to attempt to identify nodes in networks that, if removed, would greatly reduce the spread of misinformation. Sharma et al. (2021) train a network-based model on data from the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) troll datasets released by Twitter and use it to identify coordinated groups spreading anti-vaccination and anti-masks conspiracies. A different use of machine learning to identify misinformation – in this case, false news articles – can be found in Godel et al. (2021). Here we assess the possibility of crowdsourcing fact checking of news articles by testing a wide range of different possible rules for how decisions could possibly be made by crowds. Compared with intuitively simple rules such as “take the mode of the crowd”, we ﬁnd that machine learning methods that draw upon a richer set of features – and in particular when analysed using convolutional neural nets – far outperform simple aggregation rules 11 See, for example, https://informationtracer.com/, which is presented in Z. Chen et al. (2021). 390 J. A. Tucker in having the judgment of the crowd match the assessment of a set of professional fact checkers. Given the scale at which misinformation spreads, it is clear that any content moderation policy related to misinformation will need to rely on machine learning to at least some extent. From this vantage point, the progress the ﬁeld has made in recent years must be seen as encouraging; still, important challenges remain. First, the necessary data to train models is not always available, either because platforms do not make it available to researchers due to privacy or commercial concerns or because it has, ironically, been deleted as part of the process of content moderation.12 In some cases, platforms have released data of deleted accounts for scholarly research, but even here the method by which these accounts were iden- tiﬁed generally remains a black box. Second, for any supervised learning method, the question of the robustness of a classiﬁer designed to identify misinformation in one context to detect it in another context (different language, different country, different context even in the same country and language) remains paramount. While this is a problem for measuring sentiment on policy issues or hate speech as well, we have reason to suspect that the contextual nature of misinformation might make this even more challenging and suggests the potential value of unsupervised and/or network-based models. Third, so many of the methods to date rely on training classiﬁers based on news that has existed in the information ecosystem for extended periods of time, while the challenge for content moderation is to be able to identify misinformation in near real time before it spreads widely (Godel et al., 2021). Finally, false positives can have negative consequences as well, if the reaction to identifying misinformation is to suppress its spread. While reducing the spread of misinformation receives the most attention, it is important to remember that reducing true news in circulation is also costly, so future studies should try to explicitly address this trade-off, perhaps by attempting to assess the impact of methods of identifying misinformation for the overall makeup of the information ecosystem. 20.5 Computational Social Science and Coordinated Foreign Inﬂuence Operations A third area in which Computational Social Science plays an important role in protecting democratic integrity is in the study of foreign inﬂuence operations. Here, I deﬁne foreign inﬂuence operations as coordinated attempts online by one state to inﬂuence the attitudes and behaviours of citizens of another state.13 While foreign 12 Tools such as the Wayback Machine have been creatively applied in some instances to get around this issue of deletion (Bastos & Farkas, 2019; Knuutila et al., 2020). 13 For reviews of media reports of foreign inﬂuence operations globally, see Bradshaw et al. (2021), O’Connor et al. (2020), and Martin and Shapiro (2019). 20 Computational Social Science for Policy and Quality of Democracy:... 391 propaganda efforts of course precede the advent of the modern digital information age, the cost of mounting coordinated foreign inﬂuence operations has signiﬁcantly dropped in the digital information era, especially due to the rise of social media platforms.14 Research on coordinated foreign inﬂuence operations (hereafter CFIOs) can loosely be described as falling into one of two categories: attempts to describe what actually happened as part of previously identiﬁed CFIOs and attempts to develop methods to identify new CFIOs. Notably, the scholarly literature on the former is much larger (although one would guess that research on the latter is being conducted by social media platforms). Crucially, almost all of this literature, though, is dependent on having a list of identiﬁed accounts and/or posts that are part of CFIOs – by deﬁnition if the goal is to describe what happened in a CFIO and for use as training data if the goal is to develop methods to identify CFIOs. Accordingly, the primary source of data for the studies described in the remainder of this section are collections of posts from (or list of accounts involved with) CFIOs released by social media platforms. After having turned over lists of CFIO accounts to the US government as part of congressional testimony, Twitter has emerged as a leader in this regard; however other platforms including Reddit and Facebook have made CFIO data available for external research as well.15 By far the most studied subject of CFIOs is the activities of the Russian IRA in the United States (Bail et al., 2020; Bastos & Farkas, 2019) and in particular in the period of time surrounding the 2016 US presidential election (Arif et al., 2018; Boyd et al., 2018; DiResta et al., 2022; Golovchenko et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2018; Linvill & Warren, 2020; Lukito, 2020; Yin et al., 2018; Zannettou et al., 2020). Studies of CFIOs in other countries include Russian inﬂuence attempts in Germany (Dawson & Innes, 2019), across 12 European countries (Innes et al., 2021), Syria (Metzger & Siegel, 2019), Libya, Sudan, Madagascar, Central African Republic, and Mozambique (Grossman et al., 2019, 2020); Chinese inﬂuence attempts in the United Kingdom (Schliebs et al., 2021), Hong Kong, and Taiwan 14 In a way, coordinated foreign inﬂuence operations that rely on disguised social media accounts – that is, accounts pretending to be actors that they are not – could be considered another form of misinformation, with the identity of the online actors here being the misinformation. It is important to note, though, that coordinated foreign inﬂuence operations are not used solely to spread misinformation. Foreign inﬂuence operations can, and do, rely on true information in addition to misinformation; indeed, Yin et al. (2018) found that Russian foreign inﬂuence accounts on Twitter were actually much more likely to share links to legitimate news sources – and in particular to local news sources – than they were to low-quality news sources. 15 Two other potential sources of data included leaked data and data from actors that researchers can identify – or at least speculate – as being involved in foreign inﬂuence activities, such as Chinese ambassadors (Schliebs et al., 2021), the FB pages of Chinese state media (Molter & DiResta, 2020), or the Twitter accounts of Russian state media actors (Metzger & Siegel, 2019). While there have been a series of very interesting papers published based on leaked data to identify coordinated domestic propaganda efforts (Keller et al., 2020; King et al., 2017; Sobolev, 2019), I am not aware of any CFIO studies at this time based on leaked data. 392 J. A. Tucker (Wallis et al., 2020); and the US (Molter & DiResta, 2020) and Iranian inﬂuence attempts in the Middle East (Elswah et al., 2019). The methods employed in these studies vary, but many involve a role for Com- putational Social Science. In Yin et al. (2018) and Golovchenko et al. (2020), we extract hyperlinks shared by Russian IRA trolls using a custom-built Computational Social Science tool; in the latter study, we also utilize methods described earlier in this review in the measuring public opinion section to automate the estimation of the ideological placement of the shared links. Zannettou et al. (2020) extract and analyse the images shared by Russian IRA accounts. Innes et al. (2021), Dawson and Innes (2019), and Arif et al. (2018) all rely on various forms of network analysis to track the spread of IRA content in Germany, Europe, and the United States, respectively. Two studies of Chinese inﬂuence operations use sentiment analysis – again, in a manner similar to the one described earlier in the measuring public option section – to measure whether inﬂuence operations are relying on positive or negative messages (Molter & DiResta, 2020; Wallis et al., 2020). In a similar vein, Boyd et al. (2018) use NLP tools to chart the stylistic evolution of Russian IRA posts over time. DiResta et al. (2022) and Metzger and Siegel (2019)use structural topic models to dig deeper into the topics discussed by Russian inﬂuence operations in the United States and tweets by Russian state media about Syria, respectively. Lukito (2020) employs a similar method to the one discussed earlier in the measuring public opinion section regarding whether elites or masses drive the discussion of political topics to argue that the Russian IRA was trying out topics on Reddit before purchasing ads on those subjects on Facebook. Other papers combine digital trace data from social media platforms such as Facebook ads (Kim et al., 2018) or exposure to IRA tweets (Bail et al., 2020;Eady et al., 2022) with survey data. A number of studies rely on qualitative analyses based on human annotation of CFIO account activity (e.g. Innes et al. (2021) include a case study of a Russian inﬂuence in Estonia to supplement a network-based study of Russian inﬂuence in 12 European countries; see also Bastos and Farkas, 2019; Dawson and Innes, 2019; DiResta et al., 2022; and Linvill and Warren, 2020), but even in these cases, Computational Social Science plays a role in allowing scholars to extract the relevant posts and accounts for analysis. What there is much less of, though, are studies of the actual inﬂuence of exposure to CFIOs, which is a direction in which the literature should try to expand in the future. Two exceptions are Bail et al. (2020) and Eady et al. (2022), both of which rely on panel survey data combined with data on exposure to tweets by Russian trolls that took place between waves of the panel survey. A second strand of the Computational Social Science literature involves trying to use machine learning to identify CFIOs.16 One approach has been to use the releases of posts from CFIOs by social media platforms as training data for supervised 16 Note that there is also a much larger literature on detecting automated social media accounts or bots (Ferrara et al., 2016; Stukaletal., 2017) which is beyond the subject of this review. Bots come 20 Computational Social Science for Policy and Quality of Democracy:... 393 models to identify new CFIOs (or at least new CFIOs that are unknown to the models); both Alizadeh et al. (2020) and Marcellino et al. (2020) report promising ﬁndings using this approach. Innes et al. (2021) ﬁlter on keywords and then attempt to identify inﬂuence campaigns through network analysis; this approach has the advantage of not needing to use training data, although the ultimate ﬁndings will of course be a function of the original keyword search. Schliebs et al. (2021)use NLP techniques to look for common phrases or patterns across the posts from Chinese diplomats, thus suggesting evidence of a coordinated campaign. This method also does not require training data, but, unlike either of the previous approaches, does require identifying the potential actors involved in the CFIO as a precursor to the analysis. Taken together, it is clear that a great deal about the ways in which CFIOs operate in the modern digital era has been learned in a short period of time. That being said, a strikingly large proportion of recent research has focused on the activities of Russian CFIOs around the 2016 US elections; future research should continue to look at inﬂuence operations run by other countries with other targets.17 There is also clearly a lot more work to be done in terms of understanding the impact of CFIOs, as well as in developing methods for identifying these campaigns. This latter point reﬂects a fundamental reality of the ﬁeld, which is that its development has occurred largely because the platforms chose (or were compelled) to release data, and it is to this topic that I turn in some brief concluding remarks in the following section. 20.6 The Importance of External Data Access Online hate, disinformation, and online coordinated inﬂuence operations all pose potential threats to the quality of democracy, to say nothing of the threats to people whose personal lives may be impacted by being attacked online or being exposed to dangerous misinformation. Computational Social Science – and in particular tools that facilitate working with large collections of (digital trace) data and innovations in machine learning – have important roles to play in helping society understand the nature of these threats, as well as potential mitigation strategies. Indeed, social scientists are getting better and better at incorporating the newest developments in machine learning (e.g. neural networks, pre-trained transformer models) into their research. So many of the results laid out in the previous sections are incredibly impressive and represent research we would not have even conceived of being able to do a decade ago. up a lot in discussion for CFIOs, as bots can be a useful vehicle for such campaigns. Sufﬁce it to say, Computational Social Science methods play a very important role in the detection of bots. 17 This picture looks a lot more troubling if one takes out the numerous excellent reports produced by the Stanford Internet Observatory on CFIOs targeting Africa and the Middle East. 394 J. A. Tucker That being said, the ﬁeld as a whole remains dependent on the availability of data. And here, social scientists ﬁnd themselves in a different position than in years past. Previously, most quantitative social research was conducted either with administrative data (e.g. election results, unemployment data, test scores) or with data – usually survey or experimental – that we could collect ourselves. As Nathaniel Persily and I have noted in much greater detail elsewhere (Persily & Tucker, 2020a, b, 2021), we now ﬁnd ourselves in a world where the data which we need to do our research on the kinds of topics surveyed in this handbook chapter are “owned” by a handful of very large private companies. Thus, the key to advancing our knowledge of all of the topics discussed in this review, as well as the continued development of related methods and tools, is a legal and regulatory framework that ensures that outside researchers that are not employees of the platforms, and who are committed to sharing the results of their research with both the mass public and policy makers, are able to continue to access the data necessary for this research.18 Let me give just two examples. First, almost none of the work surveyed in the previous section on CFIOs would have been possible had Twitter not decided to release its collections of tweets produced by CFIOs after they were taken off the platform. Yes, it is fantastic that Twitter did (and has continued to) release these data, but we as a society do not want to be at the mercy of decisions by platforms to release data for matters as crucial as understanding whether foreign countries are interfering in democratic processes. And just because Twitter has chosen to do this in the past, it does not mean that it will continue to do so in the future. Second, even with all the data that Twitter releases publicly through its researcher API, external researchers still do not have access to impressions data (e.g. how many times tweets were seen and by whom). While some have come up with creative ways to try to estimate impressions, this means that any research that is built around impressions is carrying out studies with unnecessary noise in our estimates; a decision by Twitter tomorrow could change this reality. For all of the topics in this review – hate speech, misinformation, foreign inﬂuence campaigns – impressions are crucially important pieces of the puzzle that we are currently missing. As of the ﬁnal editing of this essay, though, important steps are being taken on both sides of the Atlantic to try to address this question of data access for external academic researchers. In the United States, a number of bills have recently been introduced in the national legislature that include components aimed 18 Of course, issues surrounding data access raise very important issues in terms of obligations to users of social media to both protect their privacy and to make sure their voices are heard. The myriad of trade-offs in this regard are far beyond the purview of this chapter, but I invite interested readers to see the discussion of trade-offs between data privacy and data access for public-facing research to inform public policy in Persily and Tucker (2020b, pp. 321–324), the chapter by Taylor (2023) in the present handbook, as well as the proposal for a “Researcher Code of Conduct” – as laid out in Article 40 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDRP) – by the European Digital Media Observatory multi-stakeholder Working Group on Platform-to-Researcher Data Access: https://edmo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Report-of-the-European-Digital-Media- Observatorys-Working-Group-on-Platform-to-Researcher-Data-Access-2022.pdf. 20 Computational Social Science for Policy and Quality of Democracy:... 395 at making social media data available to external researchers for public-facing analysis.19 While such bills are a still a long way from being made into law, the fact that multiple lawmakers are taking the matter seriously is a positive step forwards. Perhaps more importantly in terms of immediate impact, the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) has provisions allowing data access to “vetted researchers” of key platforms, in order for researchers to evaluate how platforms work and how online risk evolves and to support transparency, accountability, and compliance with the new laws and regulations.20 Computational Social Science has a huge role to play in helping us understand some of the most important challenges faced by democratic societies today. The scholarship that is being produced is incredibly inspiring, and the methodological leaps that are occurring in such short periods of time were perhaps previously unimaginable. But at the end of the day, the ultimate quality of the work we are able to do will depend on the data to which we have access. Thus data access needs to be a fundamental part of any forward-facing research plan for improving what Computational Social Science can teach us about threats to democracy.

I would 19 See, for example, https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/coons-portman- klobuchar-announce-legislation-to-ensure-transparency-at-social-media-platforms; https:// www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/bennet-introduces-landmark-legislation-to- establish-federal-commission-to-oversee-digital-platforms; and https://trahan.house.gov/news/ documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2112. 20 The Act deﬁnes “vetted researchers” as individuals “with an afﬁliation with an academic institution, independence from commercial interests, proven subject or methodological expertise, and the ability to comply with data security and conﬁdentiality requirements” (Nonnecke & Carlton, 2022). The Act requires platforms to make three categories of data available with online databases or APIs: data needed to assess systemic risks (dissemination of illegal content, impacts on fundamental rights, coordinated manipulation of the platform’s services), “data on the accuracy, functioning, and testing of algorithmic systems for content moderation, recommender systems or advertising systems, and data on processes and outputs of content moderation or internal complaint-handling systems” (Nonnecke & Carlton, 2022), Moreover, VLOPs (very large online platforms) are required, by Article 63, to create a public digital ad repository with information on ad content, those behind ads, whether it was targeted, parameters for targeting, and number of recipients (Nonnecke & Carlton, 2022). Member states will be required to designate independent “Digital Service Coordinators”, who will supervise compliance with the new rules on their territory (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_2348). The EU Parliament and Council and Commission reached a compromise regarding the text for the DSA on April 23, 2022. The ﬁnal text is expected to be conﬁrmed soon, and once formally approved, it will apply after 15 months or from January 1, 2024 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/ detail/en/QANDA_20_2348). See as well the discussion of data altruism, and the possibility of donating data for research, in https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/05/ 16/le-conseil-approuve-l-acte-sur-la-gouvernance-des-donnees/. 396 J. A. Tucker like to thank Matteo Fontana for his very helpful feedback on the ﬁrst draft of this chapter, as well as the rest of the CSS4P team (Eleonora Bertoni, Lorenzo Gabrielli, Serena Signorelli, and Michele Vespe) for inviting me to contribute the chapter, their patience with my schedule, and their helpful comments and suggestions along the way.

Chapter 21 Social Interactions, Resilience, and Access to Economic Opportunity: A Research Agenda for the Field of Computational Social Science Theresa Kuchler and Johannes Stroebel Abstract We argue that the increasing availability of digital trace data presents substantial opportunities for researchers and policy makers to better understand the importance of social networks and social interactions in fostering economic opportunity and resilience. We review recent research efforts that have studied these questions using data from a wide range of sources, including online social networking platform such as Facebook, call detail record data, and network data from payment systems. We also describe opportunities for expanding these research agendas by using other digital trace data, and discuss various promising paths to increase researcher access to the required data, which is often collected and owned by private corporations. 21.1 Introduction Social networks facilitate much of modern economic activity. Workers use them to ﬁnd jobs and investors to learn about new investment opportunities. Social networks can serve to spread information, enforce social norms, and sustain collaboration, trade, and lending. The tangible and intangible resources that individuals can access through their social networks—that is, the social capital available to them—are central to fostering their resilience to a range of economic shocks, from recessions to health emergencies to environmental disasters. Understanding the relationships between social interactions and economic out- comes is therefore of central importance to policy makers. For example, in 2020, T. Kuchler · J. Stroebel (\u0002) NYU Stern, NBER, CEPR, CESifo, New York, NY, USA e-mail: theresa.kuchler@nyu.edu; johannes.stroebel@nyu.edu © The Author(s) 2023 E. Bertoni et al. (eds.), Handbook of Computational Social Science for Policy, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16624-2_21 405 406 T. Kuchler and J. Stroebel the European Commission’s ﬁrst annual Strategic Foresight Report1 prominently identiﬁed the concept of resilience as a central compass for EU policy making. Increasing the resilience of communities involves strengthening their abilities not only to “withstand and cope with challenges” but also to “undergo transitions in a sustainable, fair, and democratic manner”. Investing in social capital is crucial to achieving these objectives. However, policy makers who hope to increase resilience and economic opportunity by fostering social networks face challenges, in part due to a number of important gaps in the academic literature that studies the economic effects of social networks. To close some of these gaps, researchers need to better understand which features of social networks—for example, their size, connectedness, homogeneity, or geographic spread—contribute to the resilience of communities and their access to economic opportunities. Similarly, it is unclear how resilience and economic opportunity are affected by different types of social connections, such as connections among family members, friends, neighbours, or colleagues. As we discuss in this chapter, computational social scientists are in a strong position to answer such questions about the role of networks and social capital in fostering community resilience and economic opportunity. While policy makers are naturally interested in the economic effects of social networks, fostering strong networks might also be a direct policy objective. For example, following the large increase in immigration to Europe from refugees ﬂeeing violence in Syria and Afghanistan, many European governments are highly concerned with the question of how to best achieve the social integration of these refugees (European Commission, 2020). While social integration has multiple aspects, including labour market attachment and language acquisition, a central aspect is the formation of ties of camaraderie between immigrants and natives. Such ties are desirable in themselves, independent of their positive economic effects, and researchers are increasingly interested in measuring and explaining the formation of such links between different groups (Bailey et al., 2022). The primary objective of this chapter is to discuss a number of approaches and data sources that hold promise for computational social science research studying the economic effects of social networks. In particular, we focus on opportunities to use the recent explosion in digital trace data—the footprints produced by users’ interactions with information systems such as websites and smartphone apps—to make progress on questions of policy interest (see also Lazer et al., 2009, 2020). Compared to traditional survey instruments to measure social networks, digital trace data offers a host of advantages: with it, researchers can observe social interactions as they organically occur, circumvent response biases, and measure social networks at unprecedented scales. But while some sources of digital trace data have recently become more accessible to researchers, others have not. In this sense, and in the spirit of this volume, our discussion of future research avenues will be partly aspirational. 1 https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/strategic-planning/strategic-foresight/2020-strategic- foresight-report_en 21 Social Interactions, Resilience, and Access to Economic Opportunity:... 407 21.2 Current Progress The role of social networks and social capital in creating economic resilience, exchange, and opportunity has been the focus of research across several ﬁelds, including sociology and economics. While it is impossible to do justice to this wide-ranging literature in the few short paragraphs available here, we next describe several research papers that have worked with particularly new and promising datasets. We encourage readers who are interested in obtaining more comprehensive overviews to start with recent review articles. Readers interested in more theoretical treatments could start with Jackson (2011) and Jackson et al. (2017), who discuss various economic applications of social networks, and Jackson (2020), who provides a formal typology of measures of social capital and their interactions with network measures. Readers who are looking for an overview of empirical work on the economic effects of social networks might start with Kuchler and Stroebel (2021), who review the role of social interactions in household ﬁnancial decision-making, and Jackson (2021), who summarizes the evidence on the interaction between social capital and economic inequality. In addition, several chapters of the Handbook of Social Economics (edited by Benhabib, 2011) summarize the evidence on peer effects across a wide range of settings. Finally, for discussions of identiﬁcation challenges in the peer effects literature, see Bramoullé et al. (2020)and Kuchler and Stroebel (2021). One takeaway from these reviews is that much of the existing empirical research into the economic effects of social networks has measured networks either by using data from a few relatively small surveys (e.g. the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health) or by deﬁning networks according to individuals’ memberships in observable associations (e.g. groups of neighbours or work colleagues). However, in recent years, the increased availability of digital trace data has led to a surge of interest in using tools from the computational social science to better understand economic activity. (An earlier literature has studied the topological structure of social graphs across a variety of online social networking services but without explicitly linking the structure of networks to economic outcome variables of interest; see Magno et al. (2012) and Ugander et al. (2011).) We next discuss some data sources that have the ability to push forward the frontier of this ﬁeld of research. 21.2.1 Online Social Networking Services The appeal of working with data from online social networking services is clear: these widely adopted services record social links between many individuals and even, in some cases, the strength of these ties. The scale of the most successful online social networks is astonishing. As of the second quarter of 2021, Facebook had 2.9 billion monthly active users—nearly 40 per cent of the world’s population— and as of their last reports, Twitter and LinkedIn each had over 300 million active 408 T. Kuchler and J. Stroebel users. WeChat, a China-based online platform that includes a substantial social networking element, had 1.25 billion users. The enormous user bases of these platforms dwarf the sample sizes traditionally studied by economists and social scientists and provide researchers not only with sufﬁcient statistical power to detect granular patterns but also with data that is difﬁcult or expensive to obtain directly via surveys. Already, a number of researchers have worked with anonymized (individual- level) microdata from Facebook to study a broad range of economic and social outcomes. For example, Gee et al. (2017) explore the extent to which weak and strong ties might help individuals ﬁnd new jobs. Similarly, Bailey et al. (2018a, 2019a, b) study the role of social interactions in driving optimism in housing and mortgage markets. Bailey et al. (2019a, b) use data from Facebook to study the role of peer effects in product adoption, and Bailey et al. (2020a) study the role of information obtained through friends on individuals’ social distancing behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bailey et al. (2022) use data from Facebook to explore the determinants of the social integration of Syrian migrants in Germany. Data from online social networking platforms can also be a rich record of cross-country and cross-regional connections. Using more aggregated data from Facebook—data we describe in more detail in Sect. 21.3.2—researchers have explored the historical and cultural drivers of social connectedness across European regions (Bailey et al., 2020b), as well as the relationship between social connections and international trade ﬂows (Bailey et al., 2021), migration (Bailey et al., 2018b), investment (Kuchler et al., 2021), bank lending (Rehbein et al., 2020), and the spread of COVID-19 (Kuchler et al., 2020). While Facebook is the largest online social networking platform in the world, other platforms—in particular those that offer different services and therefore measure different types of networks—are also valuable data sources for researchers. Jeffers (2017) uses LinkedIn data on professional networks to study the role of labour mobility frictions in reducing entrepreneurship. Bakshy et al. (2011) quantify the inﬂuence of Twitter users by studying the diffusion of information that they post, and Bollen et al. (2011) measure the sentiment of Tweets to predict stock market movements. In a similar vein, Vosoughi et al. (2018) examine the network structure of sharing behaviour on Twitter to document that false news often spreads faster and more widely than true news. As illustrated by these studies, social networking platforms have information on a large set of variables. Besides the connections between pairs of individuals, these services collect data on the personal characteristics that users choose to share—for example, education, employment, and relationship status—as well as the content they produce or engage with (such as posts, messages, and “likes”). With advances in natural language processing (NLP) methods, which extract meaning from text, the latter type of data provides increasing opportunities for researchers to measure opinions and beliefs that are otherwise hard to capture at scale. A recent example is Bailey et al. (2020a), who use Facebook posts to measure attitudes towards social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. (For a review of text mining and NLP research with Facebook and Twitter data, see Salloum et al. (2017)). 21 Social Interactions, Resilience, and Access to Economic Opportunity:... 409 Moreover, many of these services record a rich set of metadata, including users’ log-in times and geographic locations. Several recent studies have exploited location data from Facebook to study social distancing behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic (Ananyev et al., 2021; Bailey et al., 2020a; Tian et al., 2022). Similarly, most apps record information on the phone type used to log into the apps. Combined with other information, this can provide a proxy of a users’ income or socio-economic status (see Chetty et al., 2022a, b). Such data can be very helpful to researchers hoping to study the effects of social capital on outcomes such as social mobility. Indeed, many measures of social capital that the literature associates with beneﬁcial outcomes relate to the extent to which relatively poor individuals are connected with relatively rich individuals—see, for example, the work of Loury (1976), and Bourdieu (1986), and the discussion in Chetty et al. (2022a, b). Measuring the variation of such “bridging capital” across regions or other groups requires information not only on networks but also on the income or socio-economic status of each individual node. 21.2.2 Other Communication Networks The widespread adoption of smartphones has generated a trove of data capturing various aspects of economic and social behaviours. A large body of research has used smartphone location data—available from companies such as SafeGraph, Veraset, and Unacast—to study a range of topics, from the effect of partisanship on family ties (Chen & Rohla, 2018) to the role of staff networks in spreading COVID-19 in nursing homes (Chen et al., 2021) to racial segregation and other racial disparities (Athey et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2020). Another set of research has used call detail record (CDR) data to understand the economic effects of social networks. This literature includes Björkegren (2019), who uses CDR data from Rwanda to study the spread of network goods (goods whose beneﬁts to a user depend on the network of other users), as well as Büchel andEhrlich(2020) and Büchel et al. (2020), whouse CDR data toanalyse how geographic distance impacts interpersonal exchange and how social networks affect residential mobility decisions, respectively. Other sources of digital trace data suggest further avenues for advancing research on social networks and resilience. For example, researchers who wish to study the relationship between segregation and resilience might follow Davis et al. (2019) in using data from services such as Yelp—a platform that allows users to review local businesses—to test whether people of different racial or socio-economic backgrounds visit the same parks, restaurants, hotels, stores, or other public places. Email and direct messaging networks can also offer insights into the structure of networks. For example, data on who communicates with whom within a corporation or community can allow researchers to establish how hierarchical organizations are, or how quickly information spreads within a community—both of which can be related to economic resilience and opportunity. For example, the analysis by Diesner 410 T. Kuchler and J. Stroebel et al. (2005) of the Enron email corpus illustrates the patterns of communication within a collapsing organization. Data from other professional communication tools, such as Slack, Skype, or Bloomberg chat, might also offer insights into how the communications of traders and other ﬁnance professionals shape trading behaviour and asset prices. 21.2.3 Financial or Business Transaction Networks One crucial way through which social networks bolster economic resilience is by providing a foundation for the ﬂow of credit and insurance, and a long line of sociological research illustrates this phenomenon in myriad communities. An early example is Geertz’s (1962) description of the rotating credit associations of small communities in Asia and Africa, where members periodically contribute money to a fund that can be claimed by each member on a schedule. More recently, Banerjee et al. (2013) document how well-connected individuals in Indian villages—for instance, shopkeepers and teachers—play an essential role in spreading information about a microﬁnance programme. But the importance of social networks in fostering access to ﬁnancial resources is not limited to less-developed countries. In Europe, crowdfunding platforms such as GoFundMe and Kickstarter have hosted campaigns to help refugees, rescue small businesses during the COVID-19 recession, and ﬁnance individuals’ medical needs, educational expenses, or creative ventures. Data from such crowdfunding platforms is thus an interesting and valuable source of information for researchers hoping to measure the strength of social capital across communities. Social networks can also provide essential resources to small businesses. Two classic discussions in the literature are provided by Light (1984), who attributes the entrepreneurial success of Korean immigrants in Los Angeles to social solidarity, nepotistic hiring, mutual support groups, and political connections, and by Coleman (1988), who describes Jewish diamond merchants in New York City exchanging stones with each other for inspection, relying on close ethnic ties, rather than expensive formal contracts, as insurance against theft. Furthermore, with the growth of online payment platforms (e.g. PayPal, Venmo, WeChat Pay, and Wise) and peer-to-peer lending websites (e.g. Zopa and Lend- ingClub), it is increasingly possible to observe networks of ﬁnancial transactions among friends and family as well as strangers. An example of work beneﬁting from such data is by Sheridan (2020) who uses data from MobilePay, a Danish mobile payment platform, to measure social networks. Sheridan (2020)shows that individuals’ spending responds to their friends’ unemployment shocks, thereby documenting that spending and consumption are linked across social networks. In an international context, remittances by immigrants to their home countries are an important economic force in many countries with substantial expat communities. Increasingly, such remittances are sent electronically, allowing for systematic measurement. We view the use of these types of data sources as highly promising 21 Social Interactions, Resilience, and Access to Economic Opportunity:... 411 directions for researchers interested in studying the contribution of various types of social capital to the resilience of communities. 21.2.4 Civic Networks Although sociologists have characterized a central product of social networks— social capital—in various different ways (see the discussion in Chetty et al., 2022a), one inﬂuential description by Putnam (2000) emphasizes citizens’ participation in civic and community life, their respect for moral norms and obligations, and their trust in institutions and in one another. Digital trace data can be used to provide new ways of measuring these aspects of civic social capital. A growing body of literature has used digital trace data to analyse the relationship between social networks and political trends, especially polarization. Employing innovative text, content, and sentiment analysis techniques, researchers have quan- tiﬁed patterns in political news and discourse on Facebook and Twitter (e.g. Alashri et al., 2016; Engesser et al., 2017; Moody-Ramirez & Church, 2019). Other work has found that individuals’ socio-economic backgrounds can predict their civic engagement on social media (e.g. Hopp and Vargo, 2017;Lane et al., 2017)and that social media can drive their real-life political opinions and behaviours (e.g. Amador Diaz Lopez et al., 2017; Bond et al., 2017; Gil de Zúñiga et al., 2012; Groshek and Koc-Michalska, 2017; Kosinskietal., 2013). In particular, there has been enormous interest in researching the causes and consequences of “fake news” on social media (e.g. Allcott and Gentzkow, 2017; Guess et al., 2019; Lazer et al., 2018). Besides Facebook and Twitter, other sources of digital trace data provide further opportunities to measure civic beliefs and behaviours and to construct measures of civic social capital. An emerging strand of research uses data from e-petition platforms—including governmental sites established by the White House (Dumas et al., 2015) and the Bundestag (Puschmann et al., 2017), as well as commercial sites such as Change.org (Halpin et al., 2018)—to study the forces that motivate citizens’ political engagement. Elnoshokaty et al. (2016), for instance, have found that the success of petitions is more strongly driven by emotional elements than by moral or cognitive ones. Combined with records of online and ofﬂine social connections, this data offers the opportunity to study attitudes not only towards governmental policies and programmes but also towards those of communities such as universities and neighbourhood associations. 21.3 The Way Forward Despite the economic and political importance of better understanding the effects of various types of social networks, research has long been hindered by the lack of large-scale data on individuals’ social interactions. Moreover, to study 412 T. Kuchler and J. Stroebel how individuals’ networks affect their economic outcomes, economists must not only measure connections between individuals but also match these measurements to data on income, savings, consumption, health, or other variables of interest. The difﬁculty of obtaining such complex data can pose a serious roadblock to researchers. 21.3.1 Increasing Access to Microdata As illustrated in our discussion in the previous section, the richest datasets on social networks are usually not in the public domain, but are instead held by corporations. The digital trace data created on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube, WeChat, TikTok (Douyin), Meetup, and Nextdoor hold immense promise for empirical research on which types of people form connections, how and where they meet, and whether their acquaintances and friends shape their future behaviours. As for research on professional networks, LinkedIn, along with its European competitors XING and Viadeo, possesses records that can shed light on important labour market patterns. While these microdata hold much promise for conducting research of substantial value to policy makers and the academic community, there are obvious challenges to facilitating large-scale data access to researchers. Most importantly, the ﬁrms holding the data are responsible for safeguarding the privacy of their users and have to trade off the beneﬁts of research to the broader public against potential reputational and legal risks from collaborating with researchers on these projects. There are a number of paths that researchers have followed in navigating the challenge of accessing microdata owned by corporations. On the one hand, some researchers have gained access to proprietary data by working directly with companies as employees, contractors, or consultants. These agreements often involve signing nondisclosure agreements, and companies usually retain the right to veto publication if they are concerned, for example, that their users’ anonymity is compromised by the results. Because of the potential for various conﬂicts of interest in such relationships, some members of the research community have expressed concerns about bias in the questions asked or the results generated by researchers with such arrangements. On the other hand, researchers may attempt to work independently of the companies whose data they analyse. For example, they might be able to use data that companies publicize through application programming interfaces (APIs) or data purchased from market research ﬁrms. However, the former source of data may be unstructured or incomplete, while the latter, collected through methods that are sometimes opaque, might be unrepresentative or prohibitively expensive. (For a longer discussion of the tradeoffs researchers face in accessing proprietary microdata, see Lazer et al. (2020)). To help navigate these challenges, there have been recent advances in developing models of industry-academic data-sharing collaborations that seek to facilitate 21 Social Interactions, Resilience, and Access to Economic Opportunity:... 413 researchers’ access to anonymized microdata held by ﬁrms while guaranteeing their ability to publish ﬁndings independent of a ﬁnal review by the company. Most prominent is Facebook’s relationship with Social Science One, launched after the 2016 US elections (see King and Persily (2020) for details). We believe that policy makers have the opportunity—and even the responsibility—to play a key role in advancing the various attempts by ﬁrms and academic researchers to collaborate on producing publicly accessible research on questions of high social importance. A key aspect of this is to create legal certainty about how academic research would be treated within various privacy frameworks, ideally carving out exemptions for public good research to the frameworks’ most restrictive provisions. For example, the US Federal Trade Commission recently highlighted2 that its consent decree with Facebook “does not bar Facebook from creating exceptions for good-faith research in the public interest”. Increasing support from policy makers to facilitate public interest research within the frameworks of other privacy regulations, such as the European Union’s GDPR, would be hugely beneﬁcial to the academic research community and broader society. 21.3.2 Increasing Access to Aggregated Data While working with individual-level data offers several important advantages for researchers, these collaborations are often hard to scale, in part due to the substantial resources that companies must invest to provide privacy-protected access to their data. In addition, many outcome variables of interest cannot be merged to individual-level data in a privacy-preserving way. On the ﬂipside, there are many opportunities for better understanding the role of social networks and social interactions by using more aggregated data on social networks, social capital, and mobility. One prominent example of such aggregated data is the Social Connectedness Index (SCI), which was introduced by Bailey et al. (2018a, b). The SCI is based on the universe of friendship links on Facebook and measures the relative probability that a random pair of Facebook users across two locations are friends with each other on Facebook. For example, Fig. 21.1 shows a heat map of the social connectedness to Düsseldorf in Germany to all European NUTS2 regions. Importantly, the SCI data is publicly available3 to researchers through the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX). As of February 2022, this data has been downloaded more than 16,000 times, demonstrating that the research and policy communities are highly interested in accessing aggregated data sets, even at such 2 https://www.ftc.gov/blog-posts/2021/08/letter-acting-director-bureau-consumer-protection- samuel-levine-facebook 3 https://data.humdata.org/dataset/social-connectedness-index 414 T. Kuchler and J. Stroebel Fig. 21.1 Heat map shows the strength of social connections of European NUTS2 regions to Düsseldorf. Darker colours correspond to stronger social ties. The data source is the Social Connectedness Index described in Bailey et al. (2018b) relatively coarse levels of aggregation. We believe that there are many opportu- nities to deepen the insights from such data sets by further disaggregation—for example, by demographics or by setting. This ﬁner level of information would allow researchers to study questions about how social connectedness varies across individuals of different ages, ethnicities, nationalities, genders, or educational and professional backgrounds. Other sources of aggregated data also offer opportunities to understand how social networks and social capital affect economic outcomes. For example, LinkedIn could provide aggregated measures of connectedness across geographic locations, allowing researchers to study similarities and differences between the structure of professional networks and friendship networks. Similarly, measures of the connectedness between ﬁrms could be useful to study the determinants of labour ﬂows. We believe that policy makers should communicate to ﬁrms that such data efforts are perceived as valuable by both the academic and the policy communities, thereby encouraging more ﬁrms to engage in similar efforts. 21 Social Interactions, Resilience, and Access to Economic Opportunity:... 415 21.4 Summary There are many interesting opportunities to work with nontraditional data sources to understand the role of social networks in fostering resilience and access to economic opportunities. Indeed, many of the data sources required to further study these questions already exist or could be collected in a relatively straightforward way. Many of these data sets are owned by private companies. An important question, then, is what can be done to facilitate more broad-based access to such data. It is critical that the private companies collecting digital trace data, aware of their unique positions to advance important research agendas, continue and expand their engagement with researchers to ﬁnd paths to improve our understanding of the economic effects of social networks. Our hope is that, over time, we reach an equilibrium where such efforts to engage with academic researchers become the expectation of companies holding unique and important data assets. We are encouraged by the creation of “Data for Good” efforts across a variety of ﬁrms such as Meta and Acxiom, as well as by the creation of formal research institutes within many corporations, such as the JPMorgan Chase Institute and the ADP Research Institute. The further expansion of such efforts holds much promise for the future of the computational social sciences. Policy makers can help this process by creating frameworks that incentivize ﬁrms to collaborate with researchers. For ﬁrms, collaborations with researchers involve substantial ﬁnancial costs and can carry reputational and legal risks. In the decision of whether to engage in collaborations that are not directly related to the core business of the ﬁrm (as is the case with many of the research questions reviewed in this chapter), these costs and risks are then weighed against potential beneﬁts to the ﬁrm, such as positive press and public goodwill. Policy makers can alter both the perceived costs and beneﬁts to ﬁrms from such collaborations. On the cost side, as highlighted above, an important element is the provision of legal certainty about how research for the social good will be treated under data privacy regulations such as GDPR. Policy makers interested in encouraging ﬁrms to collaborate with researchers on social good questions should also consider providing explicit carve-outs for these research activities in various privacy regulations. Similarly, policy makers can increase the perceived beneﬁts for ﬁrms from academic collaborations, for example, by publicly recognizing that ﬁrms’ facilitation of such collaborations contributes to the public good.

Chapter 22 Social Media Contribution to the Crisis Management Processes: Towards a More Accurate Response Integrating Citizen-Generated Content and Citizen-Led Activities Caroline Rizza Abstract The two policy questions addressed in this chapter cover the whole crisis management cycle from the response and recovery to prevention and preparedness. They consider both the beneﬁt of using citizen-generated content and the challenges of integrating citizen-led initiatives in the response. On the one hand, focusing on data allows interrogating the IT methods available to collect, process and deliver relevant information to support decision-making and response engagement. On the other hand, considering citizens’ contribution and initiatives to the crisis manage- ment processes and response requires working on organizational and collaborative processes from local, regional, national or transnational levels. This chapter frames an up-do-date state of the art on the questions of citizens’ generated content and led initiatives for crisis management and response, and it proposes directions to policy makers to that respect. It places the question of mutual trust between institutions and citizens as a key problematic in a hybrid world where mediated communication and interactions with citizens required new and adapted practices from professionals of crisis management. 22.1 Introduction The current global context, characterized by climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, poses new challenges in terms of crisis management and collaboration between world regions, countries and actors (policy makers, emergency manage- ment services, citizens and private sector actors) (European Commission Joint Research Centre, 2021). Despite their more or less long-term consequences on C. Rizza (\u0002) Information and Communication Sciences, I3-Telecom Paris (UMR 9217), Institut Polytechnique de Paris, Paris, France e-mail: caroline.rizza@telecom-paris.fr © The Author(s) 2023 E. Bertoni et al. (eds.), Handbook of Computational Social Science for Policy, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16624-2_22 421 422 C. Rizza the environment and human activities, the manifestations of these phenomena are increasingly violent and frequent in a short-term perspective. Thus, so-called civil security crises such as natural disasters, technological events or urban crises are characterized, among other things, by rapid kinetics (with a crisis peak and a return to “normal”), uncertainty, tension, victims, etc. The ﬁeld of crisis informatics studies how networked digital technologies, for instance, social media from the 2000s onwards, interact with crisis management, from both social sciences and computational sciences sensibility, notably through data science (Palen et al., 2007, 2020; Palen & Anderson, 2016). More speciﬁcally, scientiﬁc literature in this ﬁeld has highlighted the presence and simultaneous manifestation of citizen initiatives to respond to a crisis. During a disaster, people immediately react and help each other providing ﬁrst aid to victims and very often organize themselves for helping with cleaning and rebuilding during the recovery phase. As illustrations, during the Nice attacks in July 2016 in France, taxis immediately organized themselves to evacuate people from the Promenade des Anglais; a few months earlier, during the Bataclan attacks in November 2015, Parisians opened their doors to welcome those who were unable to return home; Genoa in 1976 and in 2011, having experienced two exceptionally violent ﬂash ﬂoods, twice saw its young city dwellers volunteering to clean up the streets and to help shopkeepers and residents for days on end (Rizza & Guimarães Pereira, 2014). The use of social media in daily life has enriched this range of initiatives by allowing them to be manifested and organized online, in addition to the actions that usually arise spontaneously on the ground. In the examples given above, the hashtag #parisportesouvertes was used to publicize and organize the reception of Parisians during the attacks; in Genoa in 2011, a Facebook page “Gli angeli col fango sulle magliette” became the hub of communication and organization during and after the ﬂooding, involving institutional bodies in particular. Social media, as a virtual public space, allow the emergence and organization of citizen initiatives and make available new data supporting to build a more accurate situational picture of the event and its consequences on the ground. Nevertheless, they also complexify, in ways we will develop below, crisis management and constitute a challenge in the response provided by its managers. Their integration into the crisis management process requires mutual trust that the proximity of institutional and citizen actors may facilitate. 22.2 State of the Art 22.2.1 Social Media and Crisis Management: New Perspectives Social media are Web 2.0 platforms or applications that allow their users to create content online, exchange it, consume it and interact with other users or their environment in real time (e.g., Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010; Luna & Pennock, 2018; 22 Social Media Contribution to the Crisis Management Processes: Towards... 423 Reuter et al., 2020). In 2019 Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp had 5.7 billion users worldwide (Statista, 2019) in Reuter et al. (2020). Thus, in recent years, the use of social media has increased considerably, and its nature has changed by becoming more collaborative, especially during crises or emergencies (Reuter et al., 2020). In general, social media allow users to communicate and interact in different and often combined ways: information creation and dissemination, relationship management, communication and self-expression. Based on these activities, we can distinguish (Reuter et al., 2011): – Wikis: for information gathering and knowledge creation according to a collabo- rative logic – Blogs and microblogs: for publishing information and/or self-expression – Social networks: for relationship management, self-expression and communica- tion and information gathering – Content sharing and indexing systems: for the creation and exchange of multi- media information (photos, videos) Last but not least, platforms specialized in crisis management also exist: they are run by communities of volunteers and allow, for instance, collaborative mapping (e.g., Crisis mapper, a variation of OpenStreetMap), on-site and remote contribution (e.g., Ushahidi) and public-private-citizen partnership (Wendling et al., 2013). Based on this categorization, social media are differentiated according to their main functions: Twitter as a microblog is used for the dissemination or collection of information; Facebook as a social network allows interaction between “friends” or within a “group” community; Wikipedia, as a collaborative encyclopaedia, supports the creation of collaborative knowledge and sense-making (Bubendorff & Rizza, 2021; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). Literature in the ﬁeld highlights that during a major event, speciﬁc uses of social media rise such as a combination of the main function of a platform with other functions needed in the moment. As an illustration, to make sense to an ongoing event and face its uncertainty, the discussion pages of Wikipedia become the place for exchanges within the community of contributors in the same way as a group on a social network (Bubendorff & Rizza, 2020). “Sharing and obtaining factual information is the primary function of social media usage consistently across all disaster types” (Eismann et al., 2016). Much of the literature in the ﬁeld of crisis informatics has focused on “microblogging” activities, i.e., the use of social media by citizens to report on what is happening on site during a major event. These microblogging activities have been documented based on real events: they cover both the creation and distribution of information as well as the communication and response to requests for help (Palen et al., 2009; Palen & Vieweg, 2008; Reuter et al., 2011; Tapia et al., 2013). Due to their ubiquity in citizens’ life, their speed as a relay of information and communication and their accessibility through different platforms, microblogging activities have been considered very early as an opportunity for crisis management and communication. They constitute a place where real-time information about an event is being collected (Palen et al., 2010; Reuter et al., 2011; Vieweg et al., 2010). Interestingly, Reuter et al. (2020) distinguish two reasons for harnessing information from 424 C. Rizza social media: to establish a more complete picture of the situation, also known as “situational awareness”, and to engage a response on the ground, also mentioned as “actionable information” (see also Coche et al., 2019). To this respect, several challenges related to the quality of the data and its relevance for the crisis management processes have been underlined such as issues of format, reliability, quantity, attention required, effective interpretation and contextualization (Grant et al., 2013; Ludwig et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2013;Tapia et al., 2011, 2013). From an organizational perspective, other challenges exist: issues of veriﬁcation, accountability, credibility, information overload, dedicated resource allocation as well as lack of time and experienced and trained staff (Castagnino, 2019; Hiltz et al., 2014; Hughes & Palen, 2014; Kaufhol et al., 2019; San et al., 2013). Lately, the literature on crisis management and institutional practices has been emphasizing new challenges. In order to effectively beneﬁt from the multiple sources of available data, Munkvold et al. (2019), Pilemalm et al. (2021), and Steen-Tveit and Erik Munkvold (2021) show how “situational awareness and understanding” and “common operational picture” both require more effective collaboration between the engaged stakeholders based on speciﬁc organizational processes to be established. Technical and organizational challenges have been rising in terms of combination of different information sources (e.g., video and images, social media, sensor data, body-worn devices, UAVs and open data). 22.2.2 From Citizen-Generated Content to Citizen-Led Activities: Opportunities and Challenges As mentioned in the introduction, social media have been supporting emergence and organization of online citizens’ initiatives at the occasion of a major event. Literature commonly distinguishes “real volunteers”, who act on site to respond to the crisis from “virtual volunteers”, who, located anywhere, provide help and support by organizing action and processing information on social media (Reuter et al., 2013). This distinction helps to understand how social media has become a place for expressing and organizing solidarity (Batard et al., 2018; Rizza & Guimarães Pereira, 2014). Whether these citizen initiatives take place on site or online, they are mostly spontaneous: spontaneous volunteers are people who act in response to or in anticipation of a disaster and who may or may not have the required skills (Drabek & McEntire, 2003). The notion of “afﬁliation” (‘afﬁliated’/‘unafﬁliated volunteer’) with a crisis management organization allows reﬁning this characterization (Batard et al., 2019; Stallings & Quarantelli, 1985; Zettl et al., 2017). Some volunteers have signed agreements with public institutions and their actions are coordinated. This is the case of the VOST (Virtual Operations Support Team) in Europe, for example, but other user communities such as the Waze community can also be mentioned. 22 Social Media Contribution to the Crisis Management Processes: Towards... 425 Consequently, social media enable citizens to build a collective and coherent approach to the event (Stieglitz et al., 2018). The generated content can be understood as a key element in the achievement of social resilience (Jurgens & Helsloot, 2018) where resilience is the ability of social groups and communities to recover from or respond positively to crises (Maguire & Hagan, 2007;Reuter & Spielhofer, 2017). As described above, there is a need for collaboration and reliable models between heterogeneous actors (such as police, ﬁreﬁghters, infrastructure providers, public administration and citizens) in order to improve collaborative resilience, i.e., the ability of a community to prepare for, respond to and recover from a crisis (Board on Earth Sciences and Resources, 2011; Goldstein, 2011). Therefore, the opportunities of organization and collaboration with social media offer in response to the crisis concretized their organizational dimension. However, this aspect should not minimize the challenges raised by citizens’ initiatives or engagement during a major event and the added complexity, time and organization they require from crisis management institutions. Citizen activism can have negative effects (Reuter et al., 2020). Three examples illustrate this view. During the 2011 attack in Norway, citizens’ action to save people from the attack and expression of public opinion on social media made the management of the crisis more complex for the rescue teams and crisis managers who had to respond to these citizen dynamics at some point of the crisis (Perng et al., 2013). During the 2015 Bataclan attacks, the use of the hashtag #parisportesouvertes associated with personal addresses of Parisians who were offering places to victims or people stranded outside has also required regulation from the authorities to protect citizens who were putting themselves in danger. The manhunt against the rioters of the 2011 Vancouver riots also underlines the negative side of this activism and necessity from public institutions to be fully prepared when mobilizing it (Rizza et al., 2014). 22.3 Computational Guidelines This section is articulated around two policy questions proposed by De Groeve et al. and included in a publication of the Joint Research Centre that aimed at collecting the upcoming research needs in terms of policy questions around different topics, including emergency response and disaster risk management (Bertoni et al., 2022). 22.3.1 Which Contribution to the Crisis Management Cycle? The two proposed policy questions in Bertoni et al. (2022; Chap. 15)cover the whole crisis management cycle from the response and recovery to prevention and preparedness. They consider both the beneﬁt of using citizen-generated content and the challenges of integrating citizen-led initiatives in the response. Focusing on 426 C. Rizza data allows interrogating the IT methods available to collect, process and deliver relevant information to support decision-making and response engagement. Social network analysis can also play a relevant role in the context of disinformation campaign (Starbird, 2020; Starbird et al., 2019). Considering citizens’ contribution and initiatives to the crisis management processes and response requires working on organizational and collaborative processes from local, regional, national or transnational levels. 22.3.2 Towards an Actionable Information for Practitioners In this section, we aim to address the ﬁrst set of policy questions from Bertoni et al. (2022; Chap. 15) related to the optimization of crisis response and computational methods supporting to both harness and process multiple sources of citizen- generated content. The multiplication of such data sources brings to crisis managers several visions of an event and may support settling a more accurate situational awareness based on more information, geo-localization of the data collected and cross-veriﬁcation through several platforms or formats (e.g., text, images, sensors). In that respect, in the ﬁeld of crisis informatics, several systems have been developed to process emerging sources of data from social media, sensors in smart cities, UAVs as well as external data such as open data and multidisciplinary data archives. Nevertheless, as pointed out by Coche et al. (2021a), the adoption of such systems in crisis management practices is low and may be understood or interpreted by a gap between practitioners’ expectations and what these systems provide: actionable information vs. situational awareness. The key element here relies on the fact that systems aim at improving the situational awareness by addressing practitioners’ information needs about the event while practitioners expect an “actionable information”, that is to say, a complementary piece of information allowing them to take a decision and engage concretely a response on the ground. Once settled, systems supporting EMS should collect, process and match multiple data sources and formats in order to both establish a relevant situational awareness of the event and to aggregate data in order to build actionable information supporting the engagement of a response. In this context, actionable information is relevant, timely, precise and reliable. In their research works on social media contribution to crisis management and response, Coche et al. (2021a) demonstrate that actionable information can be identiﬁed by systems only if a situational awareness is established ﬁrst. Underlining the issue that information management and ﬁltering systems for actionable information detection remain mostly unexplored in the ﬁeld, they propose to design and build new systems based on a four-step architecture where the two last steps focus on actionable information: (1) data collection and management; (2) what they call “information creation” to establish a sufﬁcient perception of the situation; (3) “information management” to understand the situation and be able to take a decision; and (4) “information ﬁltering” to anticipate the evolution of the situation. 22 Social Media Contribution to the Crisis Management Processes: Towards... 427 22.3.2.1 Designing Automatic Emergency Systems to Support Local EMS and EU Supervision: Directions Once settled the objective of data processing systems in terms of situational awareness and actionable information, recommendations about design and imple- mentation of such systems into practices can be addressed. Designing crisis situation models is based on the data available at the time of the event, and, for this purpose, heterogeneous data sources such as phone calls, the information provided by the rescue teams on the ground, sensors and UAVs or news media exist. Nevertheless, these channels do not allow automated implementation and therefore neither implementation of viable crisis models. Interestingly, social media data are already in a digital format and can be processed by a computer with minimal human interaction to input the data (Coche et al., 2021b). About automatic social media processing systems, three main types of systems to provide information to decision-makers can also be identiﬁed: – Automatic data ﬁltering systems – Real-time systems providing semantic enrichment (based on spatial, social and/or emotional context of the content) – Automatic clustering of tweets based on machine learning to ﬁlter messages from social media and successfully classify them in a category or another depending on their content and the context of the crisis, or to extract and cluster the information according to different parameters and similarities Open data and multidisciplinary open archives also constitute relevant sources of data both to contextualize an event and to analyse its impact. Chasseray et al. (2021) and Lorini et al. (2020) propose to use meta-modelling and ontology to structure this available knowledge and feed decision support systems. Relevantly, they insist on the necessity to mobilize experts to validate the information extracted through this processing. While computational method supports data extraction and processing, expert intervention can speciﬁcally focus on decision-making and response engagement. Decision support systems in crisis management and response should also facili- tate collaboration between stakeholders. Based on Fogli and Guida (2013), Fertier et al. (2020) assign three properties to these systems related to collaborative dimen- sions: sharing information with citizens, interacting with other information systems and coordinating heterogeneous and independent stakeholders while anticipating the effects of decisions made. To that respect, it is important that support decision systems based on the heterogeneous data available (“decision support environment”) provide to each crisis cell an up-to-date common operational picture allowing them to take decision, coordinate and collaborate. Fertier et al. (2020) also assign four key capabilities to these systems: improving the situation awareness through automatic collection and interpretation of raw data; processing data, in real time, by means of easy subscription to new sources; managing the issues related to big data; and processing heterogeneous data to update the model of a complex situation in real time. 428 C. Rizza However, systems of systems enabling multiagency crisis management strengthen the issue of making mass surveillance possible and require a speciﬁc attention. Interoperability combined with systems of systems and big data processing can foster the development of a technological and bureaucratic apparatus for all, encompassing surveillance and eroding civil liberties (Büscher et al., 2014; Rizza et al., 2017). The potentiality of collecting and processing data from participatory sensing makes fuzzy the boundary between decision support and control or surveillance. For instance, the knowledge database created through such system could contain pervasive information revealing individuals’ habits, routines or decisions and, consequently, constitutes a privacy infringement. To address these issues, a human practice focused approach is particularly useful when designing crisis management information systems: it allows designing and developing tools in close collaboration with EMS to and supporting them in restructuring their services in integrating these tools in their practices. It also prevents from misuse by closely working with stakeholders, understanding and framing their needs at the multiple level of the command chain. Indeed, in this context, crisis management system processing data, providing decision support and collaboration between stakeholders are more likely to be integrated into practices in respect of the rules and processes of each institution. Box 1: In Summary • Multiple formats and sources of citizen-generated content raised oppor- tunities in terms of crisis management and response: some of these data support to contextualize and understand the event (e.g., open data, multidisciplinary data archives) and others to make decision and engage response on the ground (sensors, UAVs, social media). • Computational modelling methods can support establishing a more accu- rate and timely situational awareness and providing pieces of data consti- tutive of actionable information: they move expert intervention from the collection and processing of the data to the analysis and decision-making phases. • In the case of disinformation campaign, social network analysis constitutes a relevant tool to reveal and understand the ongoing dynamics. • Such systems constitute challenges for both practitioners and researchers and IT designers. Practitioners need to integrate new information and their processing in their decision-making processes and to coordinate and col- laborate more closely. Researchers and IT designers have to develop data processing and decision-making systems embedding these new properties, answering to practitioners’ needs and giving a speciﬁc attention to legal and ethical frameworks. 22 Social Media Contribution to the Crisis Management Processes: Towards... 429 22.3.3 Integrating Citizen-Led Activities in the Crisis Management Processes This section addresses the second round of policy questions from Bertoni et al. (2022; Chap. 15) more focused on citizen-led activities and their possible integration to the crisis management processes. Social media have made possible most of these activities through the organizational dimension they propose. Beyond the beneﬁts of using citizen-generated content by means of new computational methods, how making the most from these grassroots initiatives in the crisis management cycle? 22.3.3.1 Social Media as a Communication and Organizational Infrastructure We usually think of social media as a means of communication used by institutions (e.g., ministries, municipalities, ﬁre and emergency services) to communicate with citizens top-down and improve the situational analysis of the event through the information conveyed bottom-up from citizens (Zaglia, 2021). The literature has demonstrated the changes brought by social media, how citizens have used them to communicate in the course of an event, provide information or organize to self-help. There are therefore an informational dimension and an organizational dimension to the contribution of social media to crisis management (Batard, 2021; Rizza, 2020): – Informational in that the published content constitutes a source of relevant information to assess what is happening on site. For example, ﬁre ofﬁcers can use data from social media, or photos and videos during a ﬁre outbreak, to readjust the means they need to deploy. – Organizational in that aim is to work together to respond to the crisis: for example, creating a Wikipedia page about an ongoing event (and clearing up uncertainties), communicating pending an institutional response (as it has been the case during Hurricane Irma in Cuba in 2017), helping to evacuate a place (Gard, France, July 2019), taking in victims (Paris, 2015; Var, November 2019) or helping to rebuild or to clean a city (Genoa, November 2011). 22.3.3.2 Citizens: First Links of the Crisis Management Chain? While institutions according to a top-down perspective use citizen-generated content and more largely social media to assess and communicate with citizens, citizen initiatives affect institutions horizontally in their professional practices. There is indeed a signiﬁcant difference between harnessing and using online published data to understand an ongoing event or its consequences on the ground from supporting organized grassroots initiatives or engaging citizens on site to face an event. There is still a prevailing idea that citizens need to be protected, even if the COVID-19 crisis 430 C. Rizza has been showing that the public also wants to play an active role in protecting themselves and others. In that respect, during the ﬁrst 2020 lockdown, panels of citizen-led initiatives have emerged to support states facing the ﬁrst peak of the crisis: sewing masks or making them with 3D printers to public hospitals, turning soap production into hand sanitizer production, proposing to translate information on preventative measures into different languages and sharing it to reach as many citizens as possible, etc. Despite this experience, according to some institutions, doing so would be recognizing that, somehow, crisis managers are failing (Batard, 2021). Consequently, another dimension is delaying the integration of these initiatives in the common or virtual public space. It implies placing the public on the same level as the institution; in other words, citizen-led initiatives do not just have an “impact” horizontally on professional practices and their internal rules and processes (doctrines), but their integration requires citizens to be recognized as full participants, as actors, of the crisis management and response processes. Then, the main question concerns the required conditions supporting to both recognize citizens as actors of the crisis management processes and response and integrate their initiatives in these processes. 22.3.3.3 Building Speciﬁc Partnerships and Collaborations with Existing Online Communities As underlined in the introduction of this chapter, the integration of citizen-led initiatives into the crisis management processes requires mutual trust from both sides. Again, the COVID-19 crisis illustrates the existing distrust against institu- tions, which has taken the form of misinformation campaign and required speciﬁc actions to counter this phenomenon. Among them, Wikipedia community has been working to making sense to major events, and, in that respect, the discussion pages associated to each article related to the crisis reveal the speciﬁc work done by Wikipedian contributors (Bubendorff & Rizza, 2020, 2021). Even if its contribution has not been yet fully recognized in crisis management, Wikipedia is a notorious community. Other online communities not afﬁliated to crisis management, such as forecast or road trafﬁc groups, have also been playing an increasing role at the time of an event and need speciﬁc attention by publishing, for instance, prevention messages. Consequently, working closely with these communities in order to be able to mobilize them at the time of an event from the prevention to the recovery phases would be an asset. Afﬁliated communities of volunteers such as the VOST play already fully their part by providing online support to crisis managers. Their collaboration has been recognized and formalized through institutional agreements. They constitute today a trustful and reliable network to be mobilized before, during or even after a crisis. Establishing such agreements with other citizens, communities (as already mentioned, forecast or road trafﬁc group but also related to air or water quality, earthquake monitoring, etc.) would allow crisis managers and decision- 22 Social Media Contribution to the Crisis Management Processes: Towards... 431 makers to rely on complementary and reliable raw data sources easily mobilizing in case of need. The geographical proximity of actors in the same area enables them to get to know each other better and therefore encourages mutual trust – this trust constitutes a key component to success. In order to build such partnership with online communities, it is necessary working locally on speciﬁc areas to understand the composition of the network of local actors and initiate collaborations at each level of the national territory. At the European level, mobilizing and animating these communities by topics (air, water, ﬁre, etc.), types of crises (ﬂoods, earthquake, technological event, urban crisis, etc.), type of data (social media, sensors, etc.), etc. would allow an EU monitoring of data and an EU kind of virtual taskforce. Box 2: In Summary • Social media constitute an infrastructure and a public place allowing citizens to communicate, coordinate and provide self-help initiatives. • From an organizational perspective, integrating citizen-led initiatives into the crisis management processes and the response implies recognizing citizens as the ﬁrst link of the crisis management chain. • Building collaboration and partnership with online afﬁliated and (non- )afﬁliated communities will support the constitution of relevant networks of experts easily mobilized from a local to a European level to provide data and monitor citizen-led initiatives. 22.4 The Way Forward Crisis management institutions are increasingly challenged by citizen-generated content and citizen-led initiatives. The ﬁrst one constitutes new opportunity to better assess, monitor the situation and to engage a more accurate response on the ground but, at the same time, requires time, human resources and competences to aggregate, analyse and integrate these data in the usual processes. While responding speciﬁcally to the effects of an event on site, the second ones make the usual processes more complex in several ways: they require a speciﬁc and additional attention; they can disturb the institutional response. Nevertheless, afﬁliated and non-afﬁliated volunteers and their initiatives have been demonstrating their relevant contributions to crisis management at the time of an event. What we argue in this chapter is the necessity from both types of actors (crisis managers and citizens) to both getting used of each other’s online practices. Bridg- ing the gap between such initiatives and their integration in the crisis management processes and response relies on (re-)establishing a mutual trust between institutions and citizens. Citizens have to get used to online ofﬁcial communication in their daily 432 C. Rizza life in order to be able to get the message and understand it when it is published at the time of an event. Crisis management institutions need to understand and adapt to online rules of communication to be able to be heard on online public sphere. This communication goes beyond the usual diffusion of prevention or behavioural messages and requires real interaction with citizens. In this context, computational methods and decision support systems have been improved: they tend to collect and analyse more and more multiple data sources and rely on different methodologies. They still require to be designed closely with practitioners to guarantee an answer to their needs and to ensure their integration into practices. Despite their contribution, such systems constitute only a decision support; in other words, they allow the expert intervention moving from the data extraction and processing to the analysis and decision-making phases. As an illustration, computational methods and systems may allow the VOST to focus on the analysis of the situation to be reported to crisis management institutions instead of manually screening and collecting information on social media. Despite the beneﬁt of such methods and systems, what we would like to underline is the necessary reorganization of institution internal processes in order to be able to fully and relevantly integrate citizen-generated content, as well as citizen-led initiatives in the crisis management processes.

Chapter 23 The Empirical Study of Human Mobility: Potentials and Pitfalls of Using Traditional and Digital Data Ettore Recchi and Katharina Tittel Abstract The digitization of human mobility research data and methods can temper some shortcomings of traditional approaches, particularly when more detailed or timelier data is needed to better address policy issues. We critically review the capacity of non-traditional data sources in terms of accessibility, availability, populations covered, geographical scope, representativeness bias and sensitivity, with special regard to policy purposes. We highlight how digital traces about human mobility can assist policy-making in relation to issues such as health or the environment differently to migration policy, where digital data can lead to stereotyped categorizations, unless analysis is carefully tailored to account for people’s real needs. In a world where people move for myriad reasons and these reasons may vary quickly without being incorporated in digital traces, we encourage researchers to constantly assess if what is being measured reﬂects the social phenomenon that the measurement is intended to capture and avoids rendering people visible in ways that are damaging to their rights and freedoms. 23.1 Introduction Besides the shock of the human lives lost to the disease, when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, the global public opinion was in awe by the sight of the main non-pharmaceutical intervention that governments put in place almost everywhere – lockdowns. The images of an immobile world created an unexpected dystopic landscape. The prohibition to step out of home emptied cities, highways, stations and airports. Like in a postatomic fantasy, media spread out pictures and videos of the usually most crowded venues of the planet – from Shibuya Station in Tokyo to E. Recchi (\u0002) · K.

Tittel Heathrow Airport in London – without a living soul in the middle of the day. After decades of reckless increase in the number of airline travellers, for instance, in April 2020 these were no more than 3 per cent their number a year earlier (Recchi et al., 2022). No other nonviolent event could have looked more antinomic – and thus revealing – of the nature of social life in late modernity. In the pre-Covid-19 era, the number of international trips had been on a steady and uninterrupted rise since at least 1960 – from 69 million to almost 3 billion border crossings per year (Recchi, 2015, 2016; Recchi et al., 2019). Never in history have human beings had such an ease to move out of their usual residences – whether on daily commutes, weekend trips, holiday travel or (although not across the board) long-term migration spells.1 This is clearly more the case for the rich, whose lifestyle is often patterned after frequent journeys. Nonetheless, the drop in the cost of travel has also facilitated the (shorter-haul and less exotic) mobility of the less privileged, at least in high-income countries (e.g. Demoli and Subtil, 2019). Spatial mobility has thus progressively become a hallmark of our age, as social theorists Zygmunt Bauman and John Urry happened to remark already by the turn of the millennium (Bauman, 1998; Urry, 2000). In the second half of the twentieth century, the absence of large-scale wars, economic growth, progress in transportation and ICT developments – that is, the major keys to globalization – paved the way to a more mobile world. While the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and a possibly higher sensitivity to the climate impact of fuel-propelled mobility may styme this pre-existing trend, human mobility will hardly cease to be part and parcel of what it means to live in the twenty-ﬁrst century – not the least because global inequality and climate change also spur migration (Barnett & McMichael, 2018; Milanovi´c, 2019; Rigaud et al., 2018). For a comprehensive take of the topic, we must acknowledge its different mani- festations – ﬁrst of all, in spatial terms. Human mobility is a multiscale phenomenon, spanning from the micro (local) to the meso (national) and macro (international) level. Repeated national surveys show that all of these levels saw an increase in the last decades of the twentieth century (for instance, in Germany: Zumkeller, 2009). People spend more time in mobility and cover a larger distance per time/unit than they were used to do. The second dimension that thus needs to be acknowledged is the temporal manifestation of mobility. Movements can be temporary, seasonal or longer term/permanent. The third dimension that fundamentally shapes individuals’ mobility experiences as well as legal and policy responses to it is the reason for mobility, including voluntary reasons (such as tourism, work, education or family reasons) or forced displacement (as a result of conﬂict or natural disasters), with or 1 While short-term mobility has skyrocketed in comparative terms, international migration only modestly increased in recent decades: in 2019, 3.5% of the global population qualiﬁed as migrants compared to 2.9% in 1990 (UNDESA, 2019). This proportion is obtained applying the UN deﬁnition, according to which an international migrant is somebody who has moved into a different country for 12 months or more (see the Glossary on Migration in IOM 2019). Issues of deﬁnition are discussed in the draft Handbook on Measuring International Migration through Population Censuses (UNDESA, 2017). 23 The Empirical Study of Human Mobility: Potentials and Pitfalls of Using... 439 without documentation. In practice demarcations are not always clear, since reasons are often mixed and people are often motivated to move by a multiplicity of factors (Mixed Migration Centre, 2020), and intersections between migration and other forms of circular mobility are growing (Skeldon, 2018). Think, for instance, about ‘gap years’ and ‘sabbaticals’, not only in academia. While mobility is a fundamental element of human freedom with real and perceived value for all groups affected by it, the historical intensiﬁcation of mobility – and its likely spatial-temporal clustering in certain sites (for instance, global cities) or certain periods (for instance, during end-of-year festivities) – is a key concern from a policy perspective. We mention here just two issues that have come to the fore in recent years, partly in conjunction with the Covid-19 crisis – beyond the epidemiological risk that is openly associated with the movement of virus-carrying population. First is the ‘evasiveness of remote workers’ through mobility. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, ﬁrms increasingly operate partly or completely remote, asking or allowing workers to ‘work from home’. Such a shift, which was already present in some industries like IT, may spur white collars’ relocation even at long distance – including abroad – as ‘digital nomads’. Some countries introduced so-called digital nomad visas (Bloom, 2020; Hughes, 2018) that can be used to track such mobility. Mobility in free movement zones, or if workers relocate short term on tourist visas, often goes unrecorded yet may be of increasing interest for policies related to such mobilities, including tax issues. Second is the ‘environmental and epidemiological risks’ linked to human mobility. The bulk of human mobility is fed by fossil fuel burned for road, rail, air and maritime transportation. Almost all (95 per cent) of the world’s transportation energy comes from petroleum-based fuels, largely gasoline and diesel. Globally, transportation accounts for no more than 14 per cent of the global greenhouse emissions – less than electricity and heating (25 per cent), agriculture (24 per cent) and industry (21 per cent) (Pachauri et al., 2014). These proportions vary signiﬁcantly by level of economic development though, and transportation takes the lion’s share of greenhouse gas emission in richer countries (e.g. the US: EPA, 2019). Therefore, the impact of mobility on the environment is bound to become more severe as economic development advances, unless major changes in fuel emission take place. In parallel, travel spreads diseases, and increased travel may have made the world more vulnerable to epidemics, although the intensity of long-distance mobility does not necessarily entail a stronger incidence of epidemics (Clemens & Ginn, 2020; Recchi et al., 2022). The importance of effective policy responses to mobility has been ampliﬁed during the Covid-19 pandemic. A major puzzle is whether human mobility will change in size, scope and form in the coming years. At the macroscale, the appetite of human beings for travel does not seem shaken, but travel limitations and travellers’ biometric and health controls are likely to be enhanced as ‘new normal’ ways of restricting (even surreptitiously) access to undesirable travellers (Favell & Recchi, 2020). At the meso and micro level, it is unlikely that the economic and cultural attractiveness of cities as poles of mobility will be disrupted, although the 440 E. Recchi and K. Tittel take-off of telework – as complement or substitute to ofﬁce spaces – may incentivize some sort of ‘ﬂight to the suburbs’ (Florida et al., 2021). Clearly, the pandemic moment and its aftermath expose the importance of monitoring human mobility with adequate measurement tools to improve response capacities. At the same time, the pandemic experience has also brought more attention to the ethical components of tracking mobility among the general public. 23.2 Monitoring Human Mobility: Traditional and New Data Tracking human movements in space has always been a challenge for population statistics, but new data open up new opportunities and challenges. Previous studies (European Commission, 2016; Bosco et al., 2022) offer a systematic review of the literature about measuring migration with traditional and new data sources, which we complement with up-to-date information and critical consideration from a policy-related angle. As suggested also by Taylor in this volume (Taylor, 2023), we pay particular attention to what digital data reﬂects and how it can be used for policy-relevant analysis, foregrounding the policy issue to be solved and what evidence is needed in support, discarding the ‘panopticon illusion’ (and danger) of making everything visible through mobility data. 23.2.1 Traditional Data: Pros and Cons Traditionally, mobility has been measured with censuses, population registers, administrative sources and household surveys. Data from these sources are cleaned, edited, imputed, aggregated and used to produce ofﬁcial statistics, including the datasets documenting international migration ﬂows and migrant stocks released by agencies of the United Nations. The major advantages of traditional data sources are that they are transparent, frequently curated and stored in public databases (with varied degrees of accessi- bility), allowing comparability over time and across countries. However, there are some important limitations. First, they are not reliably available in many parts of the world. Estimates on in- and out-migration ﬂows by country of origin and destination are only reported by 45 countries to the United Nations (UN DESA, 2015). Second, these aggregate statistics have a poor time and spatial resolution. Moreover, with these standard approaches, the category of internally displaced persons is often overlooked despite its policy relevance. In general, inconsistent deﬁnitions of a migrant make it difﬁcult to compare data across different countries (Sîrbu et al., 2021). Third, and as an extension of the previous point, traditional sources typically do not capture circular, short-term, seasonal or temporary mobility (Hannam et al., 2006). Fourth, surveys that include large enough samples of people with different migratory backgrounds and socioeconomic proﬁles, particularly the most 23 The Empirical Study of Human Mobility: Potentials and Pitfalls of Using... 441 vulnerable, in different contexts and over time are not at all or not systematically available despite the importance to understand inequalities in terms of education, housing, employment, discrimination, well-being, access to services and protection, etc. Finally, censuses and surveys have data publishing lags of several years.2 This is particularly problematic in a context in which migratory ﬂows become increasingly complex and dynamic, and in emergency situations, including environmental or health crisis situations. Both academic and nonacademic actors have tried to improve comparability and availability of traditional data sources and reconcile measurement problems, such as undercount, varying duration of stay criteria and coverage (de Beer et al., 2010; European Commission, 2016;Raymer et al., 2013). To respond to these shortcomings, and with the purpose of informing the humanitarian community and government partners, different international organizations have established data collection and dissemination mechanisms on speciﬁc aspects of human mobility, such as UNHCR’s refugee statistics, ILO’s labour migration statistics, the World bank remittances database or IOM’s data on various migrations matters including internal displacement and their ‘missing migrants’ project. These organizations are increasingly aiming to incorporate more digital, non-traditional data sources as part of their migration data strategies. 23.2.2 Non-traditional Data Usages: An Overview The mass use of digital devices across the globe has generated large repositories of spatiotemporal ‘trace data’ (Chi et al., 2020), some of which provide new opportunities for ad hoc measurements and modelling of human mobility. While new technologies are capturing mobility rather than migration data (McAuliffe &Sawyer, 2021), some can also be used to better understand certain aspects of migration. As outlined in Table 23.1, different non-traditional data sources differ signiﬁcantly in terms of the information available, the populations covered, geographical availability, the data level (individual or grouped), representativeness bias issues, sensitivity and in consequence in terms of who they reﬂect, the mobility events they capture (micro, meso and macro level), ethical issues and their usefulness to provide information relevant for policy purposes. In the policy sphere, categories are used to deﬁne ‘groups of people who are assumed to share particular qualities that make it reasonable to subject them to the same outcomes of policy’ (Bakewell, 2008: 436). While in relation to issues such as health or the environment, information about mobility events (how many individuals move, where, when and how) provide key information and the characteristics of who moves may be secondary, in the context of migration, analytical or administrative categories, such 2 For example, in the case of the International Migration Database of the OECD, the lag is between

450 E. Recchi and K. Tittel as ‘migrant’, ‘foreign worker’, ‘internally displaced person’ or ‘refugee’, funda- mentally shape the interactions between individuals and bureaucratic organizations. As Taylor stressed in this volume (Taylor, 2023), that connection is often obscured when computational methods and new data sources are used. 23.2.2.1 A Review of the Usefulness of Non-traditional Data to Study Different Types of Mobility Local and National Mobility At micro and meso level, geotagged digital trace data from call detail records (CDR) (e.g. Song et al., 2010), GPS technology (e.g. Bachir et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018) or social media data (e.g. Bao et al., 2016) can be used to study individual (Giannotti et al., 2011; González et al., 2008; Pappalardo et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2011) as well as group mobility (Hiir et al., 2019; Lulli et al., 2017;Tosi, 2017). Because of their wide coverage3 and ad hoc availability, these data allow studying population movements in emergency situations, such as during natural disasters (Bengtsson et al., 2011) or events like the Covid-19 pandemic (e.g. Xiong et al., 2020). In other contexts, satellite data have been used to estimate the effect of extreme climate events, such as ﬂooding, on migration (Chen et al., 2017). Compared to self-reporting on causes of migration in surveys, they offer the advantage of not being affected by subjective factors such as recall bias. While individual characteristics, such as gender or age or motivations for mobil- ity, that are key variables to consider for policy responses, are usually unavailable, researchers started to collect or link survey data with geotagged digital trace data to alleviate this limitation and get more information on demographic characteristics of the populations covered (Blumenstock & Fratamico, 2013). Other sources used for mobility research include Twitter (e.g. Fiorio et al., 2017; Zagheni et al., 2014), Skype (e.g. Kikas et al., 2015), LinkedIn (e.g. Li et al., 2019) or Flickr (Bojic et al., 2016) and could include any other platform that provides geotagged data of their users. Their usefulness for policy purposes fundamentally depends on how well represented the population of interest is on the speciﬁc platform. Large platform companies like Apple or Google also possess vast repositories of human movement data that could be used to understand local mobility patterns. While these companies do not normally publish their data for research purposes, they offered ad hoc data products and visualizations of aggregated mobility of customers, including the use of travel modes (public transport, driving, walking), during the Covid-19 pandemic (Apple, 2021; Google, 2021). Notably, however, omitted information on methods and on the underlying population that is captured 3 As of 2018, mobile phone penetration is around 100 per cent in high- and middle-income and 55 per cent in low-income countries. This has raised from 12 per cent of the world population in 2000 (Worldbank, 2019). 23 The Empirical Study of Human Mobility: Potentials and Pitfalls of Using... 451 leads to a lack of clarity of these data and their biases, limiting their usefulness for policy purposes. International Mobility Social media advertising platforms can help estimate stocks and sociodemographic proﬁles of certain populations and facilitate non-probability sampling, since the platforms support showing ads exclusively to certain audiences. This information has also been used to target speciﬁc populations in order to invite them through paid Facebook advertisement to participate in a survey, such as Polish migrants in European countries (Pötzschke & Braun, 2017). Compared to traditional surveys, this approach offers the advantage of targeting demographic characteristics to reach a larger sample size at a global scale quickly and at lower cost (Rampazzo et al., 2021). Böhme et al. (2020) used georeferenced online search data from Google Trends (looking for the combination of migration- and target country-related keywords as a proxy for migration intentions) in origin countries to improve the predictive power of international migration models. While there are promising examples in different areas employing Google Trends data, such as to forecast private consumption (Vosen &Schmidt, 2011), the precision and goodness of ﬁt of such models can also rapidly change (Lazer et al., 2014). A Special Case: Airline Mobility A major source of big data on travel are airline reservation systems (ARS). A handful of private companies dominate this market. They handle such informa- tion omitting not only personal information but also categorical groupings about sociodemographic characteristics of passengers. One of these companies, Sabre, sells an air travel dataset that reports monthly data on the numbers of air travellers between all world airports and regular airline routes. Capitalizing on this source, in combination with the more traditional statistical reports of the United Nations World Tourism Organization, researchers have created a Global Transnational Mobility Dataset which details cross-border trips between all sovereign states worldwide from 2011 to 2016 (Recchi et al., 2019). Other studies have used Sabre data to infer types of transnational mobility (Gabrielli et al., 2019) the economic impact of reduced mobility due to Covid-19 (Iacus et al., 2020), and the global spread of the pandemic in 2020 (Recchi et al., 2022). Potentially, similar data could be collected for other ticket reservation systems in bus, railway or sea lines, but such forms of transportations tend to be highly national or regional, rather than global, and thus there is possibly an issue of integration of different sources. At any rate, this is an evolving area of data collection that has proven fruitful for macro analyses of international ﬂows. Its major limit is that a travel is an event, not a person, thus leaving uncharted the characteristics of human 452 E. Recchi and K. Tittel populations that experience cross-border travel, which survey research describes as mostly – albeit not exclusively – drawn from among the middle-upper classes (Demoli & Subtil, 2019). Along these lines, Chareyron et al. (2021) used data scraped from the digital platform Tripadvisor to examine privileged mobility patterns. Other platforms for evaluating tourism consumption (accommodation, places, activities) that might be leveraged for research on this issue in certain contexts include Booking, Airbnb, Hotels.com or Weibo. Difﬁculties to Infer Policy-Relevant Categories from Digital Trace Data While digital devices trace the geolocalizations of their users, there are no standards or commonly respected methodological frameworks for how to produce estimates of policy-relevant information from granular geo-located data points (Bell et al., 2015), and the analysis of such data by data scientists without context-speciﬁc knowledge and understanding of the social phenomena underlying human mobility creates new risks (McAuliffe & Sawyer, 2021). Unlike survey data about respondents’ residential history, georeferenced digital trace data only record locations at a speciﬁc moment in time. Blondel et al. (2015)and Chi et al. (2020) introduce different estimation techniques to infer patterns of human mobility from observational geo- tagged data. Without further context-speciﬁc information, it is not straightforward to determine what the location of a given individual corresponds to (Fiorio et al., 2021). For this reason, how researchers choose to deﬁne features of trips for the ambiguous distinction between migration and other kinds of movements, and how they group geo-located data points together based on their temporality, greatly affects the consistency of human mobility estimates generated from digital trace data (Ahas et al., 2018; Fiorio et al., 2021). This points to the challenge of how to discern policy-relevant categories from inferred mobility patterns. A risk that is linked to this labelling process is called delinkage, which refers to the replacement of an individual identity by a ‘stereotyped identity with a categorical prescription of assumed needs’ (Zetter, 1991: 44). In theory, the possibilities opened by the new data sources suggest revisiting some presuppositions of such labelling and categorization processes and question the labels researchers apply to people and the functions those categories fulﬁl to design policies that effectively cater for real and not stereotyped human needs (see Turton, 2005; Bakewell, 2008). In practice, however, there are several challenges to correctly understand and interpret the underlying meaning of data variables in differ- ent contexts. Certain data, such as those scraped from LinkedIn, may offer relatively straightforward ways to identify a ‘foreign worker’ on the platform, whereas such classiﬁcation is more difﬁcult and more sensitive to contextual changes when using CDR data. Ahas et al. (2018), for example, in their roaming dataset operationalize a ‘foreign worker’ as someone who did 1 to 52 trips to a certain country in a certain time period. Such an identiﬁcation strategy would not have worked, however, during the Covid-19 pandemic, when remote work was widespread. Geolocated messages 23 The Empirical Study of Human Mobility: Potentials and Pitfalls of Using... 453 or posts are often the key variable in estimating the geo-coordinates of users, while other studies use the language used on social networks; friend or follower networks; proﬁle pictures; names; or other textual information available (e.g. Huang et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2020) to infer users’ sociodemographic characteristics. In the case of Facebook marketing data, researchers have to rely on the categories provided by the platform, even though, as Zagheni et al. (2017) highlight, categories are not documented according to scientiﬁc research standards. This may introduce biases that are hard to disentangle from biases related to selection and non- representativeness, or other inconsistencies. ‘Naming’ mobile individuals is often based on legal deﬁnitions and should be carefully considered, particularly in a context where inaccurate estimates can cause confusion and be fuel for heavily contested public and political discourses (McAuliffe & Sawyer, 2021). Without relevant content knowledge of migration and technology use, errors or wrong assumptions can lead to misspeciﬁcation and misinterpretation (McAuliffe & Sawyer, 2021), exempliﬁed by Pew Research’s 2019 estimates of irregular migrants in Europe (Connor & Passel, 2019). The authors wrongly included asylum seekers whose applications were being processed in the category of irregular migrants, leading to inaccurate and inﬂated estimates. Drawing on examples like this one, McAuliffe and Sawyer (2021) highlight that, in reality, the application of so-called new data science in the study of migration often fails to take into account the most basic understanding of the topic. 23.2.2.2 Limitations and Caveats in the Use of Non-traditional Data on Human Mobility Despite the opportunities offered by non-traditional data sources, their use comes with important limitations and caveats that add to the potentials we outlined so far. In this ﬁnal section, we list and discuss four of them. Importantly, the different non- traditional data sources differ signiﬁcantly with regard to their properties and hence related concerns. Proprietariness A ﬁrst, and rather mundane, problem with some of the above-mentioned data is difﬁcult access. Some data sources require appropriate technical skills (e.g. Facebook and LinkedIn marketing API); some data can be purchased; some sources lack formalized purchasing mechanisms (e.g. mobile phone providers), and others do not share their data at all. Moreover, by employing terms of service (TOS)- compliant methods, a researcher may respect the business prerogatives of the company that created the platform studied, but this may or may not respect the dignity and privacy of the platform users (Freelon, 2018). This is particularly sensitive in a context of radical power asymmetries with the platform/service providers, as users often have far less understanding of who can access their data 454 E. Recchi and K. Tittel and under which circumstances, as well as of the functioning of the tools they use online (Broeders & Dijstelbloem, 2015;Taylor, 2023). Non-representativeness Second, another key and too often overlooked issue with digital trace data – like in many other social science data – is selection bias: users of a particular social media platform or mobile phone provider are not representative of the underlying general population. In the analysis of CDR, selection bias regarding mobile phone ownership and usage must be considered when extrapolating from the number of moving SIM cards to the number of moving persons (Blumenstock, 2012; Blumenstock & Fratamico, 2013). For instance, in some sub-Saharan African countries, men are more likely to be mobile phone owners, while phone sharing is common among rural women, and there is considerable cross-country variation: while mobile phone records in Kenya are an excellent proxy for mobility, regardless of socioeconomic factors, mobile phone data in Rwanda are a good proxy only for the mobility of wealthy and educated men (Luca et al., 2021). While existing studies showed that approaches using CDR data work well in one-off emergencies, such as the earthquake in Haiti (Bengtsson et al., 2011) and other disaster events (Chen et al., 2017), for estimating general population displacement, ad hoc knowledge is needed about who is using phones or services. Otherwise, such approaches cannot identify vulnerabilities of speciﬁc populations, a key aspect of targeting social protection and relief (Lu et al., 2016). Similarly, Facebook and Twitter adoption rates differ between countries and depending on user characteristics, such as age or gender (Zagheni et al., 2017). By relying on data from highly specialized online services, users’ self-selection into these services hence limits the generalization of these results (Böhme et al., 2020). For instance, LinkedIn may be useful to study the labour mobility of highly educated individuals in rich countries and allows researchers to link this to career choices and industry-speciﬁc patterns. However, it cannot yield mobility estimates for the global population. This is problematic because, as Sîrbu et al. (2021) highlight, being unable to track speciﬁc groups of users can steer migration policies in directions that unwillingly perpetuate discriminations or neglect the needs of invisible groups. Different statistical approaches help to correct for selection bias. Zagheni and Weber (2015) propose a method that relies on calibration of the digital trace data against reliable ofﬁcial statistics. When the data also contains demographic information about users of a given platform, that information can be leveraged to de- bias non-representative results by adjusting the responses via multilevel regression prediction models and post-stratiﬁcation (Wang et al., 2015). Importantly, statistical calibration models require datasets containing enough variables for the use of post- stratiﬁcation techniques, as well as knowledge about speciﬁc functional relationship between estimates of migration and how this relationship varies by geography and population characteristics as well as how it changes over time – information that is often not available, and that requires systematic and hence costly on-the-ground 23 The Empirical Study of Human Mobility: Potentials and Pitfalls of Using... 455 research. Since the composition of the user bases of new data sources may change rapidly, predicting over time variation is usually more difﬁcult than understanding cross-spatial variation in human mobility. Beyond challenges that are common to any survey, such as selection bias and nonresponse, some pitfalls are speciﬁc to non-probability sampling on social media. Not only does non-probability inclusion lead to non-representative data, but the sampling error is further enhanced by the self-selection of users, which may be affected by issues of trust and incentives, and by the platform’s algorithm. To alleviate some of these shortcomings and generate more reliable and com- prehensive estimates, it is key to borrow from a number of different data sources and develop methods to analyse them that are robust to the lack of a speciﬁc data source (European Commission, 2016). For example, Huang et al. (2021)used Twitter, Google, Apple and Descartes Labs data to disentangle the disparities in mobility dynamics from lower- and upper-income US counties during Covid-19. They found that mobility from each source presented unique and even contrasting characteristics. Their (optimistic) conclusion is that hierarchical Bayesian methods can be used effectively to combine different mobility data in a consistent way. However, this requires the availability of different mobility datasets as proxies for the same phenomenon, which at the global level – given that the data showed contrasting characteristics even for the USA – seems extremely hard to achieve. No Gold Standard Third, it must be acknowledged that a proper gold standard does not exist since precise current and past mobility patterns are unknown. Therefore, validation of nowcasting models of human mobility is not straightforward. While traditional data sources have a number of limitations and caveats, without a benchmark it is difﬁcult to trust new data sources and innovative approaches and assess their validity (European Commission, 2016). Therefore, a combination of traditional and new data might yield more accurate estimates and predictions than solely relying on non-representative sources (Lazer et al., 2014; Zagheni et al., 2017). Ethical Concerns Finally, we deem appropriate to underscore some ethical caveats and raise frequently ignored data justice-related questions, which Taylor discusses in this issue (Taylor, 2023). While statistical techniques may alleviate the shortcomings of new data sources, the use of some of this information, notably individual-level data (CDR, social media data), raises severe ethical issues. Anonymization – i.e. removing personal identiﬁers – is a commonly used method to protect users’ privacy, but it is not sufﬁcient to shield privacy nor address issues related to informed consent, since in large mobility datasets, individuals can be reidentiﬁed with as little as four spatial- temporal data points, even if they do not contain identiﬁable information like names 456 E. Recchi and K. Tittel or email addresses (de Montjoye et al., 2013). Having a precise, always-on tracking of individuals, with a spatiotemporal history of their trajectories, and drawing a picture of how people use city space or move across borders and how they break rules and create informal ways to support themselves are a sensitive matter in any context, especially when data are unobtrusively collected without informed consent. Risks are aggravated in an environment where geolocations might be mapped to addresses such as religious places, abortion clinics and other sensitive areas. In the context of migration, where many individuals are vulnerable, and political freedoms cannot be taken for granted, these concerns are particularly important. It is key to consider what it means if mobile populations become more legible and, thereby, more amenable to control from above (Scott, 2008). Individual invisibility may sometimes be life-saving or, at least, grant a basic right to personal freedom. As Polzer and Hammond (2008) insist, ‘researchers who lift this veil [of invisibility] in the name of illuminating ‘creative livelihood strategies’ or ‘ﬂexible identities’ may inadvertently be alerting powerful states, the UN or NGOs to the ways in which their rules are circumvented, and thereby reduce the space for life-saving creativity and ﬂexibility in remaining invisible’. While visibility to institutions that are seen as potential allies might increase access to resources, defence of rights and legitimacy and can hence be seen as an ethical imperative, invisibility may serve as a protective shield in the absence of true legal, political and social protection, and in contexts of xenophobic and majoritarian violence. As governments and public agencies are increasingly using digital technologies for a more efﬁcient, neutral and disembodied migration management and border control (Latonero & Kift, 2018; Trimikliniotis et al., 2015), Leurs and Smets (2018) remind us that it is important to ponder how approaches, methodologies, tools and ﬁndings may be coopted or used in unintended and undesirable ways. Actors interested in better understanding human mobility may include organizations like the United Nations and aid agencies, but also private sector subcontractors, as well as actors in the ‘migration industry of connectivity services’ (Gordano Peile, 2014), such as money transfer services, mobile phone companies targeting refugees or even illegal organizations exploiting irregular migration. In a context where Western states direct much attention and investment to monitoring and combatting irregular migration in some geographical areas (Andersson, 2016; Słomczy´nska & Frankowski, 2016; Triandafyllidou & McAuliffe, 2018), journalistic coverage (BBC, 2021) of the terrifying ﬁnal hours of a fatal attempt to cross the English channel exempliﬁes not only the centrality of technology use in life-saving efforts but also the risks digital traces pose to individuals, reﬂected in them tossing their phone into the waves to protect people trafﬁckers’ identities or to hide details that may prevent their asylum claims being accepted. The key here is to try to minimize people’s vulnerability in the face of unequal power relations. This may entail very different decisions when trying to better understand labour mobility of highly educated intra-European migrants, or analysing intra-city mobility patterns by vehicle type, rather than when dealing with marginalized and vulnerable groups. Since we know about certain minority populations’ reluctance to participate in routine demographic exercises after experi- 23 The Empirical Study of Human Mobility: Potentials and Pitfalls of Using... 457 ences of marginalization and stigmatization (Weitzberg, 2015), any choice to make populations visible without informed consent should be carefully considered. 23.3 Concluding Remarks Based on the above-described potentials and pitfalls of different sources, we recom- mend that policy-makers use digital data to temper the shortcomings of traditional mobility data – namely, their poor space-time resolution, the limited availability of data disaggregated by sociodemographic characteristics, their delayed availability – when more detailed data is needed to better address policy issues related to inequalities, such as regarding housing, education, health, employment and non- discrimination. Ultimately, the usefulness of digital data and arising methodological challenges depend on research goals. For example, longitudinal mobility estimations using digital data are rendered difﬁcult by changing user bases. No single non- traditional data source captures all types of mobility, but the different sources discussed here capture related but partly different phenomena, including urban and international transport, tourism, population displacements, labour mobility of the highly educated and large-scale mobility data from different data providers, where usability depends on coverage and accessibility. Because of their higher granularity, digital data can monitor and evaluate human mobility and population presence at a higher scale, resolution and detail – in real time – spanning from the micro (local) to the meso (national) and macro (international) level. This is particularly important for policy responses in emergency situations (such as humanitarian or public health emergencies). Here, estimations based on digital data sources can help make faster and more informed decisions. However, in other contexts, it should be carefully considered who beneﬁts if individuals on the move and their practices are made visible. For models to be correctly speciﬁed and for estimations to be reliable, in- depth context-speciﬁc knowledge about the ways human mobility occurs on the ground as well as knowledge about quickly changing technology use among the populations of interest is fundamental, although difﬁcult and costly to obtain, and has to be constantly updated. Traditional statistics remain important to evaluate and complement estimations as baselines, especially in a context in which migration is the focus of signiﬁcant political and media attention and is all too frequently misunderstood or misinterpreted. Moreover, as regards migration, it is crucial that legal policy deﬁnitions and normative frameworks are respected. The bottom line is that any model of human movement should be carefully tailored to the speciﬁc local context. In an unpredictable world, where people move or not move for myriad reasons and these reasons may vary quickly, as the case of Covid-19 exempliﬁes, we encourage researchers to constantly reassess if what is being measured reﬂects the social phenomenon that the measurement is intended to assess and to ensure that their analysis does not generate injustice by rendering people visible in ways that are damaging to their rights and freedoms. This makes the data collection and analysis 458 E. Recchi and K. Tittel process more expensive and less universal than sometimes suggested in relation to new data sources and their usefulness for policy-relevant analysis. Beyond the realm of migration, digital data on human mobility can assist evidence-based policies on transportation – a primary concern in the ﬁeld of environmental policies. A well-informed understanding of human mobility and its forms is particularly urgent in a context in which a reduction of fossil fuel-propelled transports in rich countries (ﬂights, cruises and car use) is needed to mitigate global warming (Holden et al., 2019; Peeters & Dubois, 2010). A primary instance is the design of incentives to shift passengers to less polluting travel means – e.g. from airplanes to trains. Whatever the domain of interest, researchers must be aware that precise, always- on data about individuals, often unobtrusively collected without informed consent, raise several issues concerning privacy and security. Associated risks largely depend on the legal, political and social situations of the individuals or groups eventually covered by it, the actors handling this data and their interests. Operational guidelines on data responsibility are provided, for example, by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) of the United Nations system.4 Although far from frontline operations, migration research analysing big data can have a quick impact on policies (for instance, border management) and, thus, on human lives – something that traditional studies of migrants rarely had (McAuliffe & Sawyer, 2021). Just because research and policy-making on human mobility have an unprecedented potential to go hand in hand – a good news in itself – we can only urge any actor collecting, using, storing and sharing human mobility data to commit to ‘do no harm while maximizing the beneﬁts’ principles (IASC, 2021), always prioritizing the safe, ethical and effective management of personal and nonpersonal data.

Chapter 24 Towards a More Sustainable Mobility Fabiano Pallonetto Abstract The transport sector is the second most important source of emissions in the EU. It is paramount to act now towards the decarbonisation of our transport system to mitigate climate change effects. Waiting for future technological advance- ments to minimise the existing anthropogenic emissions and dramatically boost its sustainability is risky for human survival. The current chapter highlights how the path towards a sustainable transport system is a whole stakeholders’ effort involving the mass deployment of available technology, changing user behaviours, data-driven legislation, and researching and developing future disruptive technologies. The author analyses and classiﬁes the available data on various transport modals and assesses the impact of the technologies and policy measures in terms of potential reduction of carbon emissions, challenges, and opportunities. It also exempliﬁes outstanding test settings across the world on how already available technologies have contributed to the development of a lower-carbon transport setting. The chapter considers developing countries’ economic and infrastructural challenges in upgrading to a low-carbon transport system and the lack of data-driven decisions and stakeholders’ engagement measures in addressing the sector sustainability challenges. It also emphasised how a sustainable transport system should lay the foundation on data harmonisation and interoperability to accelerate innovation and promote a fast route for deploying new and more effective policies. 24.1 Introduction The transport sector has been a critical economic area for the world from the industrialisation era to the present. It is an essential ﬁnancial sector as it employs more than 11 million people, enabling international trade both in Europe and developing countries (Maparu & Mazumder, 2017). The trade-off of advanced F. Pallonetto (\u0002) Maynooth University, Maynooth, Ireland e-mail: Fabiano.Pallonetto@mu.ie © The Author(s) 2023 E. Bertoni et al. (eds.), Handbook of Computational Social Science for Policy, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16624-2_24 465 466 F. Pallonetto transport infrastructures is their environmental impact. Although the greenhouse emissions in EU decreased by 22.4% between 1990 and 2014, the greenhouse gas (GHG) contribution of the transport sector has considerably increased, amounting to more than 20.8% and rated as the second most important source of emissions in the EU (Andrés & Padilla, 2018). The pollutants emitted by endothermic engines powered by fossil fuels can also elicit harmful health effects like heart disease, asthma, and cancer. In Europe, the transport sector is the second sector for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions after the power system sector. In the USA, the emissions caused by the transport sector have overtaken the environmental impact of electricity generation (Fan et al., 2018). Road transport is responsible for 72.9% of emissions within the transport sector, followed by aviation and maritime, which account for 13.3% and 12.8%, respectively. The growing demand for transport services could determine increased air pollution, reducing the sustainability of the whole sector. However, the pandemic has disrupted the status quo offering a cause for reﬂection on how transportation needs can evolve in the coming future. Signiﬁcantly during times of restricting travel and activity measures, the travel behaviour has radically changed, showing a slight increase in shares of cycling and walking while public transport usage dropped signiﬁcantly. At the same time, private cars remained the preferred travel mode across countries (Eisenmann et al., 2021). It is also interesting to evaluate how the pandemic has provided alternative solutions to reduce the transport demand, such as blended, ﬂexible, and hybrid working, and it has established a new essential travel baseline. At the same time, technology is presenting imminent breakthroughs in the transportation sector. Electric vehicles and scooters have already been used through- out Europe but are not yet perceived as a potential replacement for endothermic cars because of their range or safety limitations (Kopplin et al., 2021). Autonomous vehicles and drones are the future technologies announced as having a high potential to reduce energy consumption and emissions, especially in the last mile operations (Figliozzi, 2020; Staat, 2018). The deployment of these technologies is imminent, but social, economic, and technological barriers and untested negative implications are slowing down the adoption. Among the concerns of these technologies, there is a potential increase in congestion, unanswered ethical questions on the control of the vehicle, and excessive travel demand (EU Directorate-General for Communication, 2020). Therefore, it is essential to assess these innovations’ potential impact and evaluate possible already available alternatives if the technology will not deliver what has been envisioned. The scalability of analysed advanced mobility solutions is probably one of the leading global challenges, especially for developing countries lacking infrastructure with less structured and competent governmental bodies. Another possible alternative tested during the pandemic could be to establish policies that could, in some ways, limit the mobility of the population. However, such an approach could become incompatible with the concept of democracy and freedom of movement. The relevance of these issues is underlined by the related policy questions in a recently published European Commission policy report (Bertoni et al., 2022, pp. 136–140). 24 Towards a More Sustainable Mobility 467 The current chapter tries to reﬂect on the points mentioned above, and it is structured into six main sections. Section 24.2 provides a detailed overview of the future and already present technologies that could positively impact the sector, including the integration perspective. Section 24.3 highlights the potential of the illustrated technologies to reduce emissions and improve the sector’s sustainability. Section 24.4 will give an overview of the impact of the pandemic on the transport sector and highlights some ﬁndings. Section 24.5 will assess the applicability of technologies to developing countries and their challenges. Section 24.6 shows how policies can further contribute to transport sustainability, while Sect. 24.7 will summarise the chapter and provide some recommendations. 24.2 Background: Computational, Environmental, and Data Aspects of Sustainable Mobility Technologies This section analyses the main characteristics of the more imminent and high- potential technologies in the mobility sector that will lead to the decarbonisation of the transport system, trying to estimate the adoption rate, the economic and environmental impact, and the data dimension. All the low emission technologies identiﬁed are compared across different characteristics and summarised in Table 24.1. The table compares each technology’s advantages, barriers, and travel range and highlights its scalability and the economic impact. A set of labels for each technology analysed is assigned to assess the solution’s effects and deﬁne an uptaking timeline. The labels identiﬁed are leverage, application timeline and potential risks. Leverage identiﬁes a technology/set of technologies that can solve one or more mobility challenges and it has been divided as high leverage and low leverage. High leverage identiﬁes technologies that could signiﬁcantly solve one or more challenges identiﬁed as critical or bottlenecks to the uptake. The low leverage label identiﬁes technologies that could solve a limited subset of broader mobility challenges. Application timeline evaluates the temporal applicability of the technology, and it has been identiﬁed as long term, medium or short term. When a solution is tagged long term, the technology will have its immediate impact after 2030. In the medium-term, it could already impact, but the adoption phase could be delayed after 2030. In short term, the technology has already impacted the mobility sector, and it is in the adoption phase. Short- and long-term solutions are necessary to improve the sector’s sustainability. In potential risk assesses the uncertainty of the impact of the technology on the emissions reduction and side effects of the full- scale deployment. It is divided in high risk, when the technology is risky because of its uncertain emission reduction, or it is not yet at commercialisation maturity or could lead to adverse side effects. If is tagged medium risk, the emission reduction impact at the full scale has been modelled, and a contingency plan for adverse risks is outlined. In case of low risk the technology could positively impact the emission reductions, and there are no relevant adverse risks on a full-scale deployment. The labels represent an evaluation based on the literature, and they should not beTable24.1RecentandupcominglowemissiontechnologiesforamoresustainablemobilityTechnologyHybridandplug-inEVConnectedautonomousEVCompressednaturalgasVHydrogenfuelcellvehiclesUnmannedaerialvehiclesCarsharingCyclingelectricbikeElectricscooterMaaSEnvironmental30–40%feweremissionsthanconventionalICEs40–60%feweremissionsthanconventionalICEsa25–60%feweremissionsthantraditionalICEs100%feweremissionsthantraditionalICEs25–50%feweremissionsthantraditionalICEsa13–18%feweremissionsthantraditionalICEs40–70%feweremissionsthantraditionalICEs40–70%feweremissionsthantraditionalICEs40–70%feweremissionsthantraditionalICEsEconomicLimited–high-impactpowersys-tem/batterystillexpensiveHigh–highimpactonthetransportsystemmodelLimited–highpricesofCNGreducethesavingsLimited–highpricesofmanufactur-ingHigh–highimpactonthetransportsystemmodelHigh–costreducedbyupto60%ofownershipHigh–lowcapitalandmaintenancecostHigh–lowcapitalandmaintenancecostHigh–lowcostperkmandnomaintenanceAdvantagesDecarbonisationisshiftedtothepowersystem/highefﬁciencyDecarbonisationtopowersys-tem/control/highefﬁciencyReducedcarbonemissions/cost-effectiveMaximumreductionofcarbonemis-sions/hydrogenDecarbonisationtopowersys-tem/reducedtraveltime,congestionReducedvehiclesontheroad,carbonemis-sions/increasedcost-effectivenessReducedcongestionandemissions/cost-effectiveReducedcongestionandemissions/cost-effectiveReducedcongestion,carbonemissions,changedbehaviourBarriersRange/rawmaterialforbatter-ies/GDPdependentEthical/range/rawmaterialforbatter-ies/safety/techbarriers/lawRange/CNGimport/reducedpowertrainRange/greenhydrogenlimited/techearlystageEthical/range/accep-tance/techbarri-ers/batterycapacitydensityPublicaccep-tance/safety/legislationgapsCycleinfrastruc-ture/integrationwithothermodalsSafety/noinfrastruc-ture/regulationsPublicaccep-tance/safety/legisla-tion/roadinfrastruc-ture/LCAAdoptionPositivetrend(+20.5%)bUndeﬁned–futuretechnologyNegativetrend(−0.04%)aPositivetrend(+0.01%)aUndeﬁned–futuretechnologyNegativetrend(−32%)Positivetrend(+3.73)aPositivetrend(+27.6%)Negativetrend(−20%)ScalabilityInprogress–charginginfrastructurenotreadyRequirescharginginfrastructure,connectionCNGinfrastructureislackingincapillarityHydrogencharginginfrastructureisnotexistentRequiresland-ing/takeoffinfrastructure,weightdependentHighscalable–ITinfrastruc-turesalreadypresentHighscalableandavailableHighscalableandavailableHighscalable–alreadyavailableonthemarketTraveldistance0to>100km0to>100km0to>100km0to>100km0to10km0to>100km0to20km0to20km0to20kmNotes43–69%moreefﬁcient,commercialvehiclesareatanearlystageofadoptionChallengesduetolackofinfrastruc-turesindevelopingcountriesNaturalgasreservesdependencycouldpromoteshalegasOnlyforpassengervehicles,notavailableforcommercialSuitableforshort-distancetripsbecauseofbatterycapacitylimitationThepandemichasrevertedtheadoptionrate,anditwillbeafewyearsdelayedThepandemichaspromotede-bikesandcyclingmoreinvestmentinthesectorneededSafetyconcernsandregulationsaredifferentforeachcountryThepandemichasrevertedtheadoptiontrend,anditwillbeafewyearsdelayedImpactLeverageHighleverageHighleverageLowleverageHighleverageHighleverageLowleverageLowleverageLowleverageLowleverageApplicationtimelineShorttermLongtermShorttermMediumtermLongtermShorttermShorttermShorttermShorttermPotentialriskMediumriskHighriskHighriskHighriskHighriskLowriskLowriskLowriskLowriskaEstimatebasedonpreliminarystudiesandliteraturereview–https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/europe-bicycle-marketbACEA,E.,2021.MakingtheTransitiontoZero-emissionMobility–trenddatafrom2014to2020 470 F. Pallonetto considered deﬁnitive or speciﬁc. However, such a classiﬁcation will provide a quick overview of what is coming, the timeline, and the potential impact. The following section adds further details to Table 24.1 on data and computational perspectives for the upcoming and future mobility technologies, starting from the imminent uptaking of electric vehicles and extending to multimodal sharing mobility concepts. 24.2.1 Hybrid and Plug-In Vehicles Electric vehicles provide an alternative to meet the needs for a green and clean source of transportation with fewer emissions and better fuel economy. There are three main categories of EVs: fully electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). As illustrated in Table 24.1, the technology is low risk and commercially available across Europe, with Norway leading the uptake of EVs with a share of 75% (Wangsness et al., 2020). In the EU, HEVs and PHEV reached the penetration of 1.25% over the 3.46% share of the whole car sector (European Environmental Agency, n.d.). The EV’s lifetime energy consumption costs are signiﬁcantly lower than conventional, between 45% and 70%. EVs are between 60% and 70% more efﬁcient than gas vehicles; however, the beneﬁt is offset by the high capital cost of the EVs’ battery technology (Habib et al., 2018). One of the adoption barriers is the battery capacity which is not enough to provide a comparable driving range to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and requires a lengthy charging duration (Capuder et al., 2020). Another major obstacle to the mass deployment of EVs is the slow implementation of charging infrastructures such as fast-charging stations and the challenges of integrating the power system. One of the primary data challenges is data interoperability between power systems, mobility providers, parking data, and charging infrastructure (Karpenko et al., 2018). Since cars are parked approximately 90% of the time, interoperability can support grid services by modulating/injecting/absorbing electricity based on grid operators’ needs and market opportunities. At the same time, operators can deliver local beneﬁts via behind-the-meter optimisation leading to a maximised energy efﬁciency and local use of renewables, fostering customers’ involvement through new services and tools. From the life cycle analysis of critical components such as EV batteries, the charging and travel historical data could lead to a life extension of the battery or innovative business models focused on second-life battery applications (Shahjalal et al., 2022). 24.2.2 Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been identiﬁed as a possible solution to various modern transport issues. The adoption of autonomous cars can provide environmen- tal beneﬁts of up to 60% and economic and social advantages (Kopelias et al., 2020). 24 Towards a More Sustainable Mobility 471 Table 24.1 shows that the beneﬁts of connected electric autonomous vehicles involve reducing emissions and energy consumption through their ability to implement eco- driving, which continuously optimises the engine to run consistently at the most efﬁcient operating points. As a result, it will also reduce emissions (Wadud et al., 2016). Additionally, the environmental advantages begin from the reduced demand for vehicles to the car’s standard maintenance and optimal operation. AVs can also provide more signiﬁcant economic beneﬁts by offering ridesharing services (Bahamonde-Birke et al., 2018). The ridesharing economy allows greater efﬁcien- cies by reallocating underutilised resources for more productive purposes, such as achieving new sources of supply at a lower cost. It requires integrated datasets and intense computational resources. Legislations for all road trafﬁc aim to ensure the best road safety; therefore, autonomous vehicles must meet their predecessors’ complex and new strict requirements. The legal challenges include public policies, trafﬁc codes, technological standards, and ethical dilemmas (Barabás et al., 2017). Furthermore, AVs pose a signiﬁcant threat to the job of professional drivers as they would change the required skills for workers whose careers are linked to mobility systems. It also may impact taxi drivers and other on-demand driver services as corporations have already begun experimenting with offering driverless experiences (Sousa et al., 2018). One of AVs’ risks is cybersecurity, which could lead to terrorist attacks and privacy intrusion (Ahangar et al., 2021). Therefore, in Table 24.1, the technology has been identiﬁed as high risk and high leverage. However, its impact on society is still projected in the long term. From the data perspective, AV requires a different approach to mobility data, such as seamless integration across data providers and social media to forecast trajectories, optimise routes, and understand common mobility patterns (Giannotti et al., 2016). 24.2.3 Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Vehicles Over 23.5 million natural gas vehicles (NGV) are on roads worldwide. The leading countries in natural gas are the Asian countries with 15.7 million natural gas vehicles, closely followed by the Latin American countries with 5.4 million natural gas vehicles (Khan et al., 2015). NGV have been identiﬁed as leading candidates for green transportation among sustainable fuel alternatives. CNG is a clean energy fuel when used as motor fuel, and there are relatively low particulate emissions and toxicity of exhaust gasses (Agarwal et al., 2018). However, there are high costs with developing the refuelling infrastructure, such as pipelines and ﬁlling stations, which are the more signiﬁcant disadvantage of the technology (Imran Khan, 2017). The considerable challenge of natural gas vehicles is the lower efﬁciency compared to gasoline vehicles and longer reﬁlling time. Other environmental challenges to the adoption of CNG vehicles concern fuel treatment and natural gas distribution (Chala et al., 2018). From the data perspective, geographical data can reduce waiting time at gas stations for reﬁlling, and satellite data analysis can support the identiﬁcation 472 F. Pallonetto of leakages. Despite advances, the technology is highly dependent on gas imports, and it is unlikely to scale, so in Table 24.1, it has been classiﬁed as low leverage. 24.2.4 Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles Fuel cell vehicles result in nearly zero tailpipe emissions during vehicle operations (Sharma & Strezov, 2017). The implementation and use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles were found to have a positive impact and result in economic savings over internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) (Watabe & Leaver, 2021). The study found that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles using hydrogen from solar and wind electrolysis will have positive economic beneﬁts beyond 2050. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant barrier concerns the safety of hydrogen vehicles and linked awareness campaigns. The concern for safety arises as hydrogen can burn in lower concentrations, and a possible spark or ﬁre may occur if there is a mixture of hydrogen and air (Manoharan et al., 2019). The second barrier involves the storage of hydrogen. A sizeable onboard storage tank is required to transport the fuel. The barrier to adoption is concerning ﬁnding the appropriate material for the storage container. As described in Table 24.1, another barrier is a lack of hydrogen infrastructure that could lead to slow adoption, the inability to charge from home, and cost-related issues to the adoption. From the social data perspective, the technology requires strong awareness campaigns to limit the focus on security concerns, and integrated data on the infrastructure could support adoption in the long term. 24.2.5 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), combine three critical principles of technology: data processing, autonomy, and boundless mobility. They enable new access to new spaces and analysis with data collection aid (Kellermann et al., 2020). UAVs have the potential to reduce energy consumption and emissions in some scenarios signiﬁcantly. Current UAVs are approximately 47 times more CO2 efﬁcient than US delivery vehicles in terms of energy consumption and approximately over 1000 times concerning emissions. Drone delivery will also signiﬁcantly shift energy and greenhouse gas consumption (Figliozzi, 2020). For instance, drones will shift energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle fuels such as diesel and gasoline to varying regional sources of electricity to be charged. The wide-scale implementation of drones will lead to economic and commercial beneﬁts. Drones can be deployed in several contexts and for varying purposes; however, drones for parcel delivery services are still in infancy, along with their “air taxi” services to transport passengers between cities. As a result of its ability to serve multiple needs, the European Commission estimates that drones will have an economic impact of 10 billion euros annually by 2035 and 24 Towards a More Sustainable Mobility 473 expects approximately 250,000 to 450,000 jobs to be created (de Miguel Molina & Santamarina Campos, 2018). Despite being identiﬁed as high leverage, there are several barriers to the public adoption of drones (Table 24.1). The most signiﬁcant anticipated obstacles to adopting drones are concerning the technical, legal, and public acceptance of drones (Kellermann et al., 2020). The technical concerns refer to autonomous ﬂying, airspace integration, and questions about battery capacity and data communication. UAV trips can ﬂood the suburb and city airspace, providing trafﬁc and safety concerns. Therefore, prioritising accurate, centralised data acquisition and control of airspace trafﬁc is required to fully deploy the technology. The second biggest potential barrier is ethical aspects, which are heavily related to privacy threats. Drones may threaten privacy because of their ability to capture imagery and collect sensitive data (Merkert & Bushell, 2020). 24.2.6 Carsharing Carsharing signiﬁcantly impacts car usage and ownership, enabling a reduction in environmental impacts. The annual environmental beneﬁt per capita is between 240 and 390 kilograms (Nijland & van Meerkerk, 2017). The same study found that the total impact of carsharing versus ownership leads to an annual emission reduction between 13% and 18%. Similar ﬁndings have been highlighted in other studies, which have found an emission reduction between 35% when hybrid vehicles are utilised and 65% when utilising electric vehicles (Baptista et al., 2014;Te & Lianghua, 2020). Carsharing is a short-term technology (Table 24.1), and it enables users to gain economic beneﬁts such as reducing travel costs associated with travel style and car ownership. Car owners saved approximately 74%, and public transit car owners saved around 60% by adopting carsharing in Ireland (Rabbitt & Ghosh, 2016). However, non-car owners may have to adapt to a multimodal active traveller lifestyle, which was found to have incurred additional costs. Safety was highlighted as an area of concern as respondents had commented that security is one of the most signiﬁcant inhibitors of carsharing. Carsharing requires a data-driven approach to learning the mobility habits of users, providing ﬂexibility in case of delays or route changes. Additionally, carsharing requires reassurance to users on the reliability and safety of the trips and drivers. Such a reassurance and safety layer can be entrusted by social network data and previous users’ feedback. 24.2.7 Micromobility Micromobility aims at providing short-distance, ﬂexible, sustainable, and cost- effective on-demand short-distance transport (between 3 and 20 km). Micromobility involves a range of small vehicles that operate at approximately 20 to 25 km/h, such as bicycles, scooters, skateboards, and electric bikes. These vehicles encourage a 474 F. Pallonetto shift towards low-carbon and sustainable modes of transport that can reduce carbon emissions from 40 to 70 per cent compared to an ICE (Abduljabbar et al., 2021). 24.2.7.1 Cycling and Electric Bikes Cycling with traditional bicycles is environmentally friendly as it does not emit emissions and is economically viable to produce (Pucher & Buehler, 2017). E-bikes are substantially more efﬁcient, with an average CO2 emission for km of 22 g, which is signiﬁcantly lower than ICE vehicles (Elliot et al., 2018; Philips et al., 2020). However, the beneﬁts of electric bikes are also varied depending on the mode of transport they are replacing (Edge et al., 2018). The wide-scale implementation and encouragement of cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation is not without its drawbacks. Cycling has been marginalised in many cities’ transports planning, and signiﬁcant barriers to adopting and implementing pro-cycling policies are caused by a lack of infrastructure, funding, and leadership (Wang, 2018). There are often compact urban structure and a lack of street space in European cities, especially inner-city areas, therefore making it challenging to implement cycling infrastructure. Concerning electric bikes, the disposal of their batteries and their manufacturing emissions is the most signiﬁcant environmental concern (Liu et al., 2021). Besides the lack of cycling infrastructure, other relevant barriers to cycling are the limited feasible trip range, personal safety concerns, the safety of bike storage, and lack of ﬂexibility for sudden route extension beyond a particular length or passenger transport. However, as identiﬁed in Table 24.1, a low-risk technology could signiﬁcantly contribute to a sustainable transport system if the ecosystem is enriched with data-driven technologies for charging, sharing, and improving the infrastructure. 24.2.7.2 Electric Scooter During the last few years, electric scooters’ uptake has been soaring. The transport solution has been identiﬁed as economic, clean, and sustainable (Table 24.1). However, introducing electric scooters as a transportation mode has caused sev- eral conﬂicts, such as problems with space, speed, and safety (Gössling, 2020; O’Keeffe, 2019). Some researchers found that the barriers varied greatly on whether respondents had used an e-scooter and how often they used it in the last month. In the survey, 46% of non-riders were satisﬁed with the current modes of transport and were not interested in e-scooters (Sanders et al., 2020). Issues with e-scooter equipment, such as being hard to ﬁnd or easy to break, were a signiﬁcant barrier among e-scooter users. Safety-related barriers were found to be more even between both groups. From the data perspective, localisation and the computation of optimal collection routes of dead scooters require accurate GPS data. Additional parking veriﬁcation through advanced computer vision techniques requires heavy computational capabilities. 24 Towards a More Sustainable Mobility 475 24.2.7.3 Mobility as a Service (MaaS) Shared mobility refers to the shared use of a vehicle. These vehicles can range from scooters to bikes or electric bikes. It is a modern and innovative transportation strategy that enables users to have short-term access to a mode of transport when required. Thus, it may increase multimodality, minimise vehicle ownership and distance travelled, and provide new ways to access goods and services. Shared mobility has an extensive and wide range of modalities; however, the development of newer mobility options, alongside the development of new technology, led to the development of the service concept known as mobility as a service (MaaS) (Machado et al., 2018). Such a concept is often described as a one-stop management platform that uniﬁes and links the purchase and delivery of mobility services such as bike sharers, share riders, and car sharers (Wong et al., 2020). Additionally, the subscription to MaaS enables tailoring and developing mobility services around an individual’s preferences, which may be beneﬁcial to both trans- port users and providers. Therefore, the seamless and affordable travel experience MaaS provides may play a signiﬁcant role in pursuing sustainable transport. Its goals are to create an integrated multimodal system and substitution private vehicles with alternative options (Jittrapirom et al., 2017). The efﬁcient running of MaaS platforms requires seamless data interoperability between operators and mobility data providers such as navigation systems to forecast demand and dynamically allocate resources such as vehicles or public transport routes. 24.3 Questions and Challenges: Decarbonisation of the Transport Sector with the Currently Available Technology As illustrated in the previous section, three leading technologies could disrupt the personal transport sector: unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and connected autonomous and hydrogen cars. Although these technologies have been classiﬁed as high leverage technologies with a potentially disruptive impact on the industry, critical technological and social barriers exist and rely on research and development progress and political and ﬁnancial factors. Additionally, without an environmental analysis of mobility behaviour and clear directives on how to shift towards more sustainable mobility solutions, it is impossible to outline a feasible roadmap to the decarbonisation of the transport system. For example, it is essential to understand if low leverage technologies can achieve the same beneﬁt as the leading future technologies illustrated. For this purpose, the aggregated impact of low leverage technologies on the annual per capita carbon footprint measured in tons of CO2 emissions is considered and computed with an open mobility dataset. It is further compared with the potential impact of the appraised high leverage technologies to assess the viability of the combined solutions. 476 F. Pallonetto It should be noted that the low leverage and low-risk solutions such as cycling, electric bike, and electric scooters have a constraint on the trip length. At the same time, carsharing and electric vehicles can cover virtually any distance, as demonstrated by numerous examples of successful carsharing initiatives such as BlaBlaCar (Quirós et al., 2021). The ﬁrst step in the analysis was to evaluate if short trips within the 20 km range represent a signiﬁcant percentage of the overall total of car trips. Users would switch to micromobility transports such as bicycles, e-scooters, electric bikes, and so on for trips between 3 and 20 km (Fiorello et al., 2016). The distance below 3 km can easily be covered by walking, so the uptake is much lower. As per literature, above the 20 km range, micromobility is not suitable and more comfortable transport modes are required. Therefore, we have analysed the share of domestic trips with private vehicles that can be replaced with micromobility transport services. The data for the analysis were extracted from the US national travel survey in 2009 and 2017 (Federal Highway Administration, 2020), which details more than 1.9 million private trips from participants across the USA, and similar results have been found throughout Europe.1 The participants, during the trial, have logged detailed data for each trip, such as distance, type of vehicle, starting and end time, duration, and destination. As illustrated in Fig. 24.1, the cumulative percentage of car trips versus distance reveals that 47.9% of trips are within the 3 km to 20 km range. The low leverage micromobility solutions could uptake a signiﬁcant percentage of the transport needs in such a range. Above the 20 km range, electric vehicles and carsharing can increase their market share until reaching their full potential. The impact of each low leverage technology has been evaluated through the literature and in terms of annual per capita carbon footprint reduction. Four scenarios for each technology have been considered and their carbon emission reduction compared to the average EU carbon emissions per capita, as illustrated in Fig. 24.2. The four scenarios illustrate a stepwise increased share of a single technology from 10% (Scenario A) to 75% (Scenario D). In the graph, carsharing does not assume any vehicle upgrading. Still, it calculates the reduction of emissions caused by fewer vehicles on the road and shared mobility, and it includes the whole range of trips above 3 km. The remaining low leverage technologies can signiﬁcantly impact the share of trips between 3 and 20 km, while between 20 and 30 km, the number of trips affected by the modal switch was reduced by 50%. Interestingly, there is a marginal positive impact of station-based bike-sharing uptake compared to dockless bike-sharing. The potential emission reduction of these technology spans from 13% associated with a carsharing penetration of 75% in Scenario D up to 33% of station-based bike-sharing in the same scenario. The scenarios do not separate the electric versus not electric bike-sharing because the two results averaged. Each scenario also considers a 5% uncertainty derived from 1 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Passenger_mobility_statistics# Distance_covered 24 Towards a More Sustainable Mobility 477 Fig. 24.1 Percentage of domestic trips within the range for modal shifting. The blue line is the total cumulative percentage of the trips, while the orange line is the cumulative percentage of trips between 3 and 20 km that a low leverage/low-risk technology could replace Fig. 24.2 Annual per capita potential EU emission reduction for each low leverage technology where 100% is the average EU emissions per capita baseline for transport 478 F. Pallonetto slightly different results in the literature. Although the technologies analysed can signiﬁcantly impact the emission reduction, the interaction and uptake of each technology are uncertain, and further analysis requires a higher level of complexity and different perspectives. Moreover, the study and the literature clearly show that reducing the total number of vehicles on the road could not necessarily lead to a proportional emission reduction (Commission & Centre, 2019). To systematically mitigate the carbon emissions from transport, focusing on a few disruptive technologies or assessing the currently available technologies to reduce the number of vehicles is not enough. It is essential to develop a holistic and data-driven approach to transport emissions (Giannotti et al., 2016). As illustrated in Wang et al., a profound discovery of phenomena that have led to emission reductions using essential temporal-spatial data is the ﬁrst step towards developing sustainable and interoperable mobility solutions. The second step is the identiﬁcation of the underlying explanations that have led to the events exploiting machine learning techniques of social-economic and temporal-spatial data. The third step is the predictive assessment of solutions’ impact achievable by combining mobility data and subject-related data (Wang et al., 2021). An interesting example of the effectiveness of this methodology is represented by the impact of the pandemic on transport. 24.4 Impact of the Pandemic The Covid-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on social life and trans- port. The lockdowns and restrictions imposed by governments worldwide to reduce transmissions have drastically affected the transport sector. Such measure was evident as global road transport had fallen below 50% compared to 2019, and commercial ﬂight transport had dropped below 75% by mid-April of 2020 (Abu-Rayash & Dincer, 2020). The pandemic has altered people’s social life routines, travel, and working behaviours. The government-imposed restrictions caused a surge of immediate change towards remote working. Remote working has dramatically affected our mobility, reducing congestion and improving productivity in several sectors (Philips et al., 2020). Global road transport has decreased by more than 50% compared to March 2019. April 2020 ﬂight activity dropped by almost 75% compared to 2019 due to a reduction in transport demand due to restrictions imposed by the government. By the end of April 2020, the total number of passenger transport had declined by 77% compared to January 2020. Lastly, air passenger transport was the least used mode of transportation because of restrictions. On utilising public transport, when conditions began to ease, the public had become more cautious with their transportation choice due to anxiety and fear of infection of Covid-19 (Campisi et al., 2020). As a result, the preference for travelling employing private vehicles increased as they felt public transport was unsafe. As reported in a survey from Jenelius et al., 25% of respondents have entirely resigned from using public transport. These results suggest that people’s perception of their well-being in 24 Towards a More Sustainable Mobility 479 public transport is essential in determining their willingness to use it. After several months, the general perception identiﬁed it as risky (Jenelius & Cebecauer, 2020; Przybylowski et al., 2021). The pandemic has resulted in developing a preference for private vehicles as their mode of transport rather than public transport. In parallel, different private transport modes such as e-scooter and bikes had peak sales trends (Eisenmann et al., 2021; Nundy et al., 2021). It has been deemed the most appropriate mode of road transport in several countries. Berlin has expanded its yellow tapes on its roads to encourage and allow more room for cyclists. In Budapest, cycles were implemented, and there has been a 300% reduction in tariffs for bikes. Lastly, in the UK, the government supported bicycles as a mode of transport. 24.5 Developing Countries Developing countries tend to suffer from a variety of issues. These countries face signiﬁcant environmental challenges due to rapid urbanisation, population growth, climate and environmental issues, and inefﬁcient governance and environmental management, therefore making it extremely difﬁcult for these countries to pursue sustainable transportation (Ameen & Mourshed, 2017). However, an interesting perspective is that developing countries could implement measures to avoid the same path as developed countries. For instance, during the pandemic, the munic- ipality of Bogota transformed a car road lane of 100 km into a bike lane to facilitate citizens to commute by bicycle (Rodriguez-Valencia et al., 2021). In most developing countries, urban areas are affected by prevailing global megatrends such as population growth and urbanisation. The main problem in achieving sustainable transportation in developing countries is a lack of quality infrastructure (Gordon, 2012). Poor infrastructure contributes to a high quantity of accidents and mortality rates. For instance, Bangladesh’s fatality rates are the highest globally at 85.6 per 10,000 vehicles in 2004, which was double the South Asian average of 40.56. Secondly, pollution is exponentially increasing and affecting population health. Lack of necessary transport infrastructure and planning leads to high trafﬁc congestion. Therefore, it is challenging to design the infrastructure to match the current needs (Kyriacou et al., 2019). However, digitalisation and the availability without strong privacy concerns of large mobility datasets could open up to test innovative solutions. For instance, the city of Manila (Philippines) has made an effort to propel digital transition and sustainable transport modes to respond to the pandemic measures. The government has pushed towards systematic data collection and establishing an open database system for all governmental transport agencies to adopt other MaaS solutions (Hasselwander et al., 2022). 480 F. Pallonetto 24.6 Policy Restrictions Covid-19 has forced society to partially renounce its freedom of movement, especially during the early stage of the pandemic when limited studies on the virus and reckless citizens’ behaviour threatened public health. From the economic perspective, the externalities cost of the restrictions posed a signiﬁcant burden on society in unequal shares (Zivin & Sanders, 2020). In such a context, personal and individual decisions no longer match the greater beneﬁt of society. Therefore, policy interventions such as the shutdown of businesses and limitations to mobility and personal freedom have caused signiﬁcant backlashes. These periods have further stressed the evidence that subsidies and incentives for sustainable and virtuous behaviours are more effective than restrictions on personal freedom. Because the climate crisis is reaching an emergency level and reducing the burden for citizens of such externality, policymakers could develop a subsidy infrastructure for environmentally friendly behaviours exploiting big data such as mobile data, metering, and location data. Privacy concerns, cybersecurity, and reliability of the data sources are still open challenges to reaching such ambitious objectives. If the policy framework is accurately planned, some technologies such as edge computing, anonymisation, gamiﬁcation, and distributed ledgers reduce the security risks and mitigate the consequences of opening the data to the public. There is often a lack of adequate planning and regulation in developing countries, leading to problems such as congestion problems and high costs and travel times. In some of these developing countries, this is caused by a poor public transport system, sense of community, and education. In contrast, mobility bottlenecks could be caused by high motorisation rates and private car use in other countries, leading to economic, social, and environmental problems (Sánchez-Atondo et al., 2020). 24.7 Conclusions and Recommendations This chapter analysed a set of future/imminent transport technologies, and they were classiﬁed based on their suitability to solve a speciﬁc transport issue (high/low leverage), deployment time (short/long term), and associated risk (high/low risk). Among the high leverage and long-term technologies, connected autonomous vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, and unmanned aerial vehicles have high disruptive potential and the necessary features to reduce carbon emissions from transport globally. Carsharing, shared electric mobility (MaaS), electric scooter, and cycling have been classiﬁed as low leverage and short-term technologies that can improve the transport sector’s sustainability. One of the main questions addressed was determining if low leverage sustainable transport modes could replace future high leverage solutions if the technology advancements do not deliver what they have promised. The study indicated that the expected average emission reduction of 24 Towards a More Sustainable Mobility 481 9.3% can be associated with the micromobility shared technologies identiﬁed if adequately promoted at the European level. It should be noted that the combination of micromobility solutions, EV adoption, and carsharing could reach a similar level of decarbonisation for passenger transport expected by high leverage technologies. However, the path towards full decarboni- sation of the transport sector is still long. Thus, waiting for future technologies will not bring any additional beneﬁt. As a ﬁrst recommendation, we can state that a sustainable transport system requires all stakeholders to work together towards the common objective of adopting low leverage technologies and creating a new data-driven infrastructure to reward sustainable mobility behaviours. As described above, it is fundamental to collect data to analyse patterns, establish a baseline, and test and verify new technologies and measures. A shared and open data repository could support the analysis of positive and negative phenomena that impact the system. The security risks of such an open data repository are well known and should be carefully considered; however, nowadays, several data distributed infrastructures based on semantic interoperability are rising and could be good candidates to be scaled across the EU. The second recommendation is to implement a reward system to promote sustain- able mobility behaviours. EV owners have been rewarded with free motorway tolls, reduced parking tariffs and taxes in several cities. Such a reward mechanism could be extended to exploiting recurrent mobility patterns. A reward for using a planning tool for short/long trips or utilising a MaaS infrastructure instead of a personal car can be awarded, and shared data can be utilised for further optimisation.2 The technology to implement a ﬂexible transport system is low leverage; Google’s Matrix APIs already provide timing, trafﬁc, and distance for different transport systems such as bikes, public transport, and cars. In the USA, Google Maps started to embed public transport tickets. The Uber CEO clearly stated they wanted to become the leader in a safe, electric, shared, and connected transportation system for cities. Private efforts should be backed up by policies to reduce mobility needs, foster remote working, and pave the way to fast, steady, and effective adoption of technologies. The third recommendation for a sustainable transport system is to exploit the heterogeneous public and big data to forecast demand and optimise road capacity, reduce peak hours’ trafﬁc, and integrate with the rewards mechanisms. Using data collected through different sources and gamiﬁcation can promote sustainable behaviours, especially if combined with social media and linked to a reward mechanism. Data integration and harmonisation are essential for the mass adoption of existing low leverage and future technologies. One of the limits of the low leverage technologies and EV adoption is to rely on the decarbonisation of the power system to deliver an essential contribution to the sector emissions. Therefore, data interoperability is necessary also for sector coupling and integration. The 2 https://www.forbes.com/sites/gusalexiou/2021/05/23/mobility-as-a-service-concept-promises- to-revolutionize-transport-accessibility/?sh=7c0524df7fe6 482 F. Pallonetto situation is more complex in developing countries because of the lack of regulation and infrastructure. In this case, probably the most appropriate solution to reduce congestion and emissions is adopting a combination of low and high leverage technologies that do not require massive investment in infrastructures such as MaaS, UAVs and waterborne or air transport. The decarbonisation of the sector for these countries will be undoubtedly further delayed in time compared to the more economically developed countries because of a slower orchestration between public and private interests. As a ﬁnal recommendation, the pandemic has also highlighted the impor- tance of remote working and provided an estimated baseline for essential travel requirements. These data should be seen as a reference scenario and used to develop subsidies and incentives towards more sustainable mobility. Although government personal freedom restrictions are not compatible with democracy unless there is a tangible health and safety risk, the associated risks of climate change emergency could justify implementing more decisive policies and actions to reduce anthropogenic carbon emissions.

Conclusions: Status and a Way Forward for Computational Social Science in Policymaking1 The number and diversity of contributions in the present handbook (24 chapters, divided in 3 sections and authored by 40 different leading experts in their ﬁeld) underline the breadth and depth of topics of interest when thinking about the role and potential of Computational Social Science in a policy context. Despite the intrinsic horizontal nature of Computational Social Science, the present contribution provides a ﬁrst reﬁned picture of the scientiﬁc and practical landscape of the discipline and its applications to policy. The role of this book, both for the policymaking world and the different research communities interested in exploring the intersection between policymaking and Computational Social Science (statisticians, econometricians, data scientists, machine learners, legal scholars, qualitative and quantitative political scientists, philosophers, etc.), is twofold. As a ﬁrst goal, we wish this book to be both a reference for terminology, deﬁnitions and concepts relative to Computational Social Science for Policy and a picture of the status of the different possible ﬁelds of application. At the same time, this book should not to be seen as an end point for the research in Computational Social Science in policymaking, but a stimulus for scientists to advance knowledge in this very ebullient ﬁeld of research. We additionally hope policymakers to be interested and inspired in implementing Computational Social Science solutions in the policy cycle, as well as to engage in a co-creation exercise with scientists and practitioners to better steer research in this very important applied ﬁeld. The set of foundational aspects described and analysed in the chapters of the ﬁrst section is fundamental in setting up the ethical, moral, legal and political context which scientists or policymakers should put themselves into when talking about Computational Social Science for Policy. This may appear not immediately obvious to many quantitative researchers who are not trained to take into consideration these aspects when performing Computational 1 The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an ofﬁcial position of the European Commission. © The Author(s) 2023 E.

Social Science research. Indeed, it may also be a stimulus (already advocated by several academic institutions across the world) to include data ethics or data justice courses when training data analytics professionals (statisticians, data scientists, data engineers, machine learning specialists, etc.) (Saltz et al., 2018). The main take-home message of the ﬁrst section of this handbook is that Computational Social Science research and applications, especially if applied to policy, must be planned and performed considering all the possible stakeholders in an inclusive and open fashion and in an environment that is able to foster cross- disciplinarity and cross-fertilisation. While this is not necessarily a new concept in the academic research devoted to Computational Social Science (see, e.g. Lazer et al., 2020), the series of chapters in the ﬁrst section of the handbook describe effectively how the environment changes when policymaking comes into the picture. Computational Social Science research has to be performed ethically (Chap. 4) and taking into account a strong social justice perspective with respect to those whose actions are being studied and analysed, as well as those affected by policy decisions triggered by Computational Social Science research (Chap. 3). Moreover, it is fundamental to consider the ecosystem in which Computational Social Science is developed (Chap. 2), also with the use of speciﬁc professional ﬁgures such as the “Data Steward”. The organisational dimension is also stressed in Chap. 1 which provides insights into the functions of public sector bodies that can be helped by Computational Social Science (detection, measurement, prediction, explanation and simulation), setting the scene for the second section. The second section reviews and presents methodologies aimed at performing those “functions of government” described in Chap. 1. Apart from the sheer power of some of the techniques presented (which are, e.g. the ability to infer political and social sentiment from unstructured text or to map the spread of a fake news on a social network), a direct connection between the phases of the policy cycle and some sets of techniques emerges, especially when talking about impact assessment and impact evaluation of policies. This focus is mentioned also fairly explicitly in some of the applied chapters (Chaps. 14 and 15 among all). Namely, a subset of the computational techniques can be used for the formulation/ex ante phases of the policy cycle, when a decision is still being formulated, and thus data about its impact (or about the impact of similar phenomena) is absent. We are referring to simulation techniques, among which we may encounter agent-based models, microsimulation, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models in macroeconomics, computable general equilibrium ones or integrated assessment models for micro and climate economics issues. For the ex-post evaluation of policies, reliable structured or unstructured data sources – where available and accessible and characterised – allow for the use of more empirical techniques, such as statistical or machine learning ones. Two other common lines of reasoning can be deducted from the methodological section: the ﬁrst one is that policies designed or assessed using Computational Social Science methods should be made available for public scrutiny, the issue of openness of data processing and of modelling techniques and the replicability of the ﬁndings used for policy purposes. The second one relates to modelling and communicating Conclusions: Status and a Way Forward for Computational Social Science. . . 489 uncertainty in policymaking, which has proven to be of key importance especially during the COVID-19 pandemic (as described, e.g. in Chap. 6). In fact, we have learned what the effective replication number Rt is, and many policymakers have based decisions on conﬁnement measures based on statistical estimates of this parameter, usually without much consideration to the uncertainty connected to the estimates, or to the robustness of the estimation procedure. We believe that further research in the perception of uncertainty in decision-making and methodological research in ﬂexible forecasting and causal inference methods are in order. As the reader may have observed, the ﬁrst two sections set up the methodological and foundational scene for CSS4P to be performed. At this point, we can observe how to develop a connection between the “offer” of Computational Social Science methods and the demand of pressing societal questions coming from policymakers; the role of “science-policy bilinguals” starts to be fundamental. This necessity of competences that cross different domains poses additional challenges to gov- ernments and supranational organisations aiming and innovate policymaking with scientiﬁc and computationally driven insights, as well as research institutions and universities who need to train established data scientists as well as students with this new paradigm of competences. The third section of the handbook (14 chapters) provides a critical review of the state of the art of the use of Computational Social Science methods in speciﬁc disciplines. In some ﬁelds the use of Computational Social Science methods has nearly reached the production level, meaning that insights from Computational Social Science are already mainstreamed into the policy cycle. Notable examples are the ﬁeld of macroeconomic forecasting (Chap. 12), where advanced forecasting models (using also nontraditional data) have been used to inform economic policy during the COVID-19 pandemic (see, e.g. Barbaglia et al., 2022), the use of integrated assessment models for the ﬁt for 55 package (Chap. 14) or the labour market intelligence through text mining on job advertisement data (Chap. 13). Other ﬁelds instead, despite showing a great deal of potential for policy, are still in their infancy (notably mobility, with respect to both sustainability aspects in Chap. 24 and the direct analysis of human mobility patterns in Chap. 23). In terms of data sources and methodologies, we can observe again the clear partition between policy ﬁelds for which the focus is on the ex ante evaluation and others for which the main interest is on ex-post assessments. Among the ﬁrst, one can observe, e.g. Chap. 11 or 15, while the focus on ex-post modelling is typical of Chaps. 12 or 20. Some ﬁelds interestingly propose a promising fusion of these modelling approaches (mainly Chaps. 14 and 17), via the use of advanced calibration techniques and/or advanced post-processing for computational models. This partition is also reﬂected by the type of data that are currently used to perform analytical work. Some disciplines are still exploring administrative data sources (e.g. Chap. 11), some others are starting to exploit less-traditional data sources (Chaps. 12 and 14), while others have fully embraced their full potential (Chaps. 18 and 15). To conclude, this book aims at presenting an important contribution in estab- lishing the context, theoretical and methodological underpinnings as well as the 490 Conclusions: Status and a Way Forward for Computational Social Science. . . state of the art of Computational Social Science in a policy context. Computational Social Science for Policy is a discipline where a deep understanding and application of ethical and social justice principles to computational modelling is fundamental. Many public sector bodies’ functions can be more effectively and efﬁciently performed using computational methods, and two classes of approaches could be identiﬁed, namely, an ex ante, simulation-based, assessment step and an ex-post, statistical learning-based, evaluation one, yet hybrid approaches are proposed, and an introduction in the scientiﬁc as well as the policy practice should be advocated. The different degrees of maturity of the different applied ﬁelds described, both in terms of the use of nontraditional data sources and their policy impact, should be appreciated and should represent a push for scientists to further contribute to policy- relevant research. At the same time, this work is expected to help practitioners and policymakers in shedding light into the potential of Computational Social Science for Policy while raising awareness of its potential and limitations in a policy context.
