Due to their ability to reduce peak load demand on traditional generators and extend the benefits of the merit order effect, they have been theorized and claimed to reduce peak electricity prices. The purpose of this study is to test these claims within CAISO and understand what effects BESSs have had on peak electricity prices. Our findings show that there has been a significant decrease in prices after the introduction of BESSs into the grid although we found no significant effects of an increasing utilization of BESSs on peak electricity prices. We conclude that BESS utilization in CAISO has had no effect on peak electricity prices. We are contributing to the literature on the tangible market impacts of BESSs, highlighting the need for further empirical research in this domain. iii Declaration We have read and applied the current research ethics guidelines concerning the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in this work, as outlined in the General Course Information.

BESSs are specific ways to store electrical energy utilizing large batteries with a capacity generally exceeding 1 Megawatt. The batteries provide a versatile solution to the challenges of intermittency and variability inherent in renewable energy generation. Therefore, BESSs have garnered significant attention from policymakers, energy providers, and researchers alike as they look to BESSs to help facilitate the green transition. Through the purchasing and storing of excess energy during periods of low demand and then releasing (selling) it when demand is high or when renewable sources are not producing, BESSs hold the potential to enhance grid stability, facilitate the transition to a more sustainable energy future, decrease load demand on traditional generators (Karaduman, 2021), and possibly lower electricity prices. This last point is what this paper will focus on, more specifically how the usage of BESSs during peak demand times has impacted peak electricity prices. This paper will specifically examine how the utilization of BESSs during peak times impacted peak electricity prices in the Californian energy market. We perform two time series analyses during the periods of 2018-2024 and 2021-2024 respectively. The first time series analysis will employ a dummy variable for BESS usage to analyze the impacts of the introduction of BESSs into the grid. The second regression will focus on the impacts that increasing utilization of BESSs have on peak prices by using a variable for BESS which captures the weekly peak percentage share of supply. All of our data is on a weekly basis. We also run fixed time effects regressions along with our main OLS regressions to understand the effects that uncaptured time fixed effects have on our results. We supplement these main regressions with several robustness checks to correctly analyze our results. The greatest challenge confronting humanity currently is climate change (World Economic Forum, 2024). The energy sector stands as the largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions globally (Ritchie et al., 2024), therefore increasing the use of renewable, non-greenhouse gas emitting 2 energy sources is vital to the continued survival of our planet. By using battery storage technology, we are able to extend the efficiency and usefulness of variable renewable energy sources, as well as promote the construction of additional renewable infrastructure (Antweiler & Müsgens, 2024). The significance of BESSs as an integral component of a clean and renewable energy landscape is hard to overstate. Electricity is a commodity which has essentially become a necessity in the modern world, and due to its rising costs, has become a major financial strain on many households around the world. Electricity prices have risen anywhere from 62.7%-112.9%, location dependent, and have increased household expenditures by as much as 4.8%, and worldwide, an additional 78-141 million people will fall into extreme poverty because of these heightened prices (Guan et al., 2023). Electricity prices have continued to climb around the world, greatly outpacing inflation (Apel, 2022). The root of these escalating costs lies in supply and demand imbalances, with electricity demand steadily increasing while supply remains constrained (Roberts, 2024). BESSs present a potential solution to both of these problems. Throughout our exploration of this topic, we observed numerous articles and studies asserting that the utilization of BESSs decreases the mean, peak, and variation in electricity prices, particularly at peak demand times (California Energy Commission, 2021; Volvo Energy, n.d.; Siddiq, 2021; Antweiler & Müsgens, 2024). Most notably a paper from the Californian Energy Commission (2021) which claimed that the decreases in peak electricity prices as evidenced in their graph (Figure 5) were due to battery technologies “cleaning up” the grid and smoothing out demand on electricity generators. Given the relatively nascent nature of BESS technology, there has been limited prior research examining the actual effects of BESS implementation on electricity prices. Hence, this is why we have decided to conduct our own in-depth investigation and analysis of the relationship between BESS use and peak electricity prices in the CAISO region. In Section 2, we provide a concise overview of the background regarding BESSs and the Californian wholesale electricity market. Following this, we delve into key theoretical concepts in Section 3 and review previous studies regarding BESSs in Section 4. In Section 5, we present our data set and detail our variables. The results of our regressions are described in Section 6 and discussed in Section 7. Finally, in Section 8, we offer conclusions based on our findings. 3 2. Background This section will discuss some foundational information to facilitate a better understanding about the subsequent sections of the paper. BESSs offer notable environmental benefits beyond load demand reduction. Their utilization extends the environmental advantages of variable renewable energy sources beyond their operational window by smoothing the inherent variation associated with renewable energy generation (Xiaodong, 2016). A study in California projected that the implementation of BESSs could lead to an 8% reduction in C02 emissions (15.5 million tons of CO2) by 2030 (Balakrishan et al., 2019). Numerous other studies have found that the implementation of BESSs decreases the long-term emissions of greenhouse gases (Craig et al., 2018) and increases the implementation rate of cleaner, renewable energies (de Sisterne, 2016). Figure 1 from Balakrishan et al. (2019) illustrates the potential life-cycle environmental impacts of BESSs compared to the current natural gas standard. The bar graph in the top left corner shows how BESSs decrease CO2 emissions quite significantly as well as fine particulate matter shown in the top right bar graph. Freshwater eutrophication and human toxicity are higher than in the natural gas scenario, although these are not relevant to the issue of climate change. Overall, they show a substantial decrease in the three measures which impact climate change the most (Climate Change, Fine Particulate Matter, and Photochemical Ozone Formation). The unavoidable energy transition away from fossil fuels will make BESS an essential part of the future grid (Teske et al., 2017). Notably, California has identified BESSs as pivotal to achieving its future environmental goals, with plans underway to transition to 100% clean energy by 2045 as outlined in the state’s energy transition plan (California Energy Commission, 2019). 4 Figure 1: Life-Cycle Environmental Impacts of BESSs (Balakrishan et al., 2019) BESS Landscape in California California presents a compelling energy market for analysis due to its extensive adoption of renewable energies and distinctive market dynamics. CAISO has been the subject of many studies precisely because of these characteristics and is also the reason we are studying it. California was one of the first regions in the world to begin using large grid-connected batteries, which first connected in very small quantities in 2016 (Kiefer, 2016). However, it was not until 2021 where BESSs began to constitute a significant portion of the grid’s electricity supply, surging from 0,8% to over 5% of all electricity supplied at peak times at the end of 2021. The development of peak BESS usage is shown below in Figure 2. Government incentives played a key role in driving the adoption of battery systems in California. For instance, the state mandated the three largest electricity producers to establish 1,325 Megawatts of battery storage capacity by 2020 (Balakrishan et al., 2019). Remarkably, this goal 5 was surpassed, and at the time of writing, boasts 6,617 Megawatts of available BESS capacity, with an expected 686% increase in capacity in the next 21 years (Gavin Newsom’s Office, 2023). We have decided to begin our study of BESS usage in 2021 because the majority of these battery storage systems did not come online until late 2020 and were not very coordinated in their schedules (illustrated in Figure 10) which muddled the results. Figure 2: Peak BESS Utilization as a Percentage of Load Supplied in CAISO from 2021-2024 (Own Calculations) Wholesale energy markets Our research focuses on the dynamics of electricity prices in the California Independent Systems Operator (CAISO) wholesale electricity market. CAISO serves as the sole operator in California 6 that facilitates a regulated wholesale energy market between producers and distributors, which are both deregulated in California (Clearly & Palmer, 2022). Electricity markets exhibit considerable complexity in their functioning, necessitating CAISO’s precise calculation of day-ahead prices, subsequently utilized in determining real-time market prices. In electricity markets, supply must always meet demand, or a blackout could quickly occur, and there are also problems when supply outstrips demand, at least within the actual distribution infrastructure. Consequently, firms engage in a delicate equilibrium to ensure parity between supply and demand. As demand escalates, an increase in electricity supplied to the grid must occur, leading to higher “ask” prices from the suppliers as it consumes greater quantities of fuel. The “ask” price of electricity suppliers is determined by the marginal cost of electricity production (Clearly & Palmer, 2022). Often, as demand rises to certain thresholds, ancillary services are employed to help the traditional electricity generators to match demand. These services typically entail higher fuel and startup costs than traditional electricity generators which are usually left running continuously. The replacement of these ancillary services is currently the most common use for BESSs. Other Energy Storage Technologies Battery energy storage systems represent just one of several energy storage solutions worldwide. It is important to understand why BESSs have emerged as the preeminent energy storage solution and the distinctions that clarify the relationship between electricity prices and BESSs. The problem of energy storage has gained increasing relevance in the last decade due to the proliferation of variable renewable energy and the need to be able to store the excess energy produced with renewable energy sources during the day. In the United States, pumped hydroelectric storage remains the most prevalent energy storage solution (EIA, 2023). However, pumped storage has witnessed a decline in popularity over the recent decades, evidenced by the absence of new pumped storage projects nationwide since 2014, with minimal activity in the preceding decade as well (Mayes, 2019). The main challenge with pumped storage hydroelectricity (and many other energy storage solutions besides batteries) is the substantial cost of capital required for construction and maintenance (NHA, 2017). Pumped storage hydro typically demands $1,500-$2,500 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), contrasting sharply with what is required for new a BESS project, which currently averages around $345/kWh and is 7 decreasing rapidly (Feldman et al., 2021). The only caveat is that pumped storage hydro has a much longer estimated lifespan than BESSs (Feldman et al., 2021; NHA, 2017). 3. Theoretical Framework This chapter will describe and analyze economic theories on BESSs and energy market dynamics that are relevant to our research question. An important part of our narrative revolves around the notion that an increase in demand causes an increase in prices, which can thus be partially offset by BESSs. This relates back to the most basic economic theory of supply and demand. The correlation between electricity prices and demand is well established. Joskow & Kahn (2001) conclude that electricity demand is one of the 3 main “market fundamentals” which they found to explain fluctuations in electricity prices. They found a highly significant relationship between the demand and electricity prices, a positive correlation collaborated by our own data, meaning a rise in demand would lead to a rise in prices. Joskow & Kahn explain that in perfect competition, these factors can adequately explain normal market conditions. In a more recent study by Durant et al. (2022), they confirm the strong association between demand and price within a day, as well as show that an increase in the use of renewable energies decreases energy prices but amplifies variability in electricity prices. Moreover, they briefly discuss how efficient energy storage could help smooth variability in prices and increase the efficiency of variable renewable energies. Geman & Roncoroni (2006) similarly discuss the idea of energy storage systems helping to smooth variability in pricing demand and prices. At the time of their study, BESSs did not exist, leading them to conclude that shocks within the electricity market lead to very harsh and sudden pricing outcomes because of the inability to store electricity, but postulated these could be smoothed with this ability. Demand shocks are a frequent occurrence in electricity markets for various reasons, often leading to a loss in consumer welfare due to significantly higher prices during these times. Consequently, there has been extensive research to understand and mitigate this phenomenon. Time of use (TOU) tariffs have emerged as the most popular way for governments and electricity utility companies to encourage consumers to limit electricity consumption during peak periods, constituting the main 8 method used in CAISO. TOU tariffs are dynamic tariffs that increase the price of electricity during peak hours but decrease in strength during hours of low consumption. Unfortunately, TOU tariffs have had little impact on the actual electricity consumption in the market. Faruqui & Sergici (2010) found that TOU tariffs only caused a modest 3%-6% decrease in electricity consumption during peak hours. Enrich et al. (2023) also claims that TOU tariffs have only accounted for a 1%-2% decrease in demand during peak periods. Both studies highlight a net decrease in consumer welfare as a consequence, as consumers endure higher prices without a commensurate reduction in demand. These studies show the imperative of reducing demand on the electricity grid to alleviate rising prices and enhance consumer welfare. However, previous studies have encountered challenges in achieving substantial reductions in electricity consumption despite price increases, often attributed to the inherent inelasticity of electricity as a commodity (Lee & Chiu, 2011). This is a well- researched fact within energy economics. Harding & Sexton (2017) and Lee & Chiu (2011) argue that consumers are generally unaware of the current price of electricity, therefore a change in price will not change their consumption behavior. They also state that electricity is a need in the modern world and there exists no substitutes, which leads to an inelastic demand curve. Because of this inelasticity, we cannot achieve a lower demand load by increasing prices, and we must try and increase electricity availability or decrease the price of producing electricity. As discussed earlier in Section 2, electricity producers establish prices based on the marginal cost of production. There is an ordering of which sources will be bought/used first, ranking from least to most expensive based on the ask price of the seller. This creates an interesting effect with renewable energies, which owing to their negligible marginal costs of production, can sell electricity at considerably lower costs than other generation sources reliant on fuel. (Woo et al., 2016; Clearly & Palmer, 2022). This drives down prices in the energy market, a phenomenon extensively researched and termed the merit order effect (Woo et al., 2016; López et al., 2020; Enrich et al., 2023). In a simulation conducted by Antweiler & Müsgens (2024), the potential of BESSs to augment the effectiveness of the merit order effect is explored by leveraging renewable energy sources during periods of excess production and high demand. Additionally, Enrich et al. (2023) propose that enhancing electricity storage would stabilize prices and increase the 9 effectiveness of renewable energy sources, by allowing for electricity to be used at different times than it is produced. The interplay between supply and demand can explain why electricity prices can become so high during peak periods of demand. Supply in a grid is limited and exhibits constant returns to scale (Geman & Roncoroni, 2006), rendering it uneconomical to maintain excessively large generation plants that are capable of accommodating all peaks. Therefore, electricity demand often peaks past the generation capacity of what is available at that time, necessitating the activation of specially allocated ancillary services which are available to give extra electricity to the grid at short notice. These services are both much more polluting and costly than traditional electricity generators (Geman & Roncoroni, 2006). Thus, when demand increases to a point where these must be activated, prices surge significantly due to the sharp increase of the marginal cost of production. Analyzing the usage of batteries during peak load demand times allows us to understand why BESSs should put downward pressure on peak electricity prices. CAISO recently released a special Battery Report in 2023 which went into detail on how their BESSs were used and affecting the market. The report revealed that half of the ancillary services provided in CAISO are presently fulfilled by BESSs, with a gradual shift towards general usage during net peak demand times. They also specified the method batteries use when participating in the buying and selling of electricity in CAISO. Unlike the conventional marginal cost pricing method, batteries price their electricity by considering the opportunity cost of discharging electricity immediately versus later. To avoid unnecessary utilization, most batteries intentionally submit higher bids during periods of low demand. The most important part of their report, as pertaining to our paper, was the quote: “On average batteries tended to bid below the average nodal price during peak hours” (CAISO 2023 p. 28). Figure 3 depicts the average BESS bid to discharge compared to the average nodal price in the summer of 2022. This illustrates that BESSs offer significantly cheaper energy to the market, supporting the notion that increasing BESS usage should reduce the average peak price of electricity. Figure 4 extends this analysis over a longer timeframe, showing how prices to discharge are higher than the average nodal price during the day when the opportunity cost to discharge its electricity is the highest. Then when the peak time of day comes it sells below the average price which should put downward pressure on electricity prices. 10 Figure 3: Daily Average Charge/Discharge Bids of BESSs in CAISO Summer 2022 (CAISO, 2023) Figure 4: Quarterly Average Charge/Discharge Bids of BESSs in CAISO for 2021 and 2022 (CAISO, 2023) 11 The Californian Energy Commission explores the pricing impact that BESSs have had on the grid. They note a decline in peak prices and an increase in minimum prices attributed to BESS deployment. Figure 5 below illustrates this claim, with an accompanied caption which states “Batteries participating in the energy market have the effect of moderating extreme high and low prices.” Figure 5: Peak Price Decrease in CAISO from 2019 to 2021 (CAISO, 2021) There are many theoretical benefits that come from the implementation and use of BESSs as outlined in this section, with the most significant being the amplification of the price decreasing nature of the merit order effect and the reduction in load demanded on traditional generators. The positive relationship between demand and prices has been thoroughly empirically proven and is an important aspect of our story about BESSs. Given that BESSs influence the demand placed on generation sources reliant on fuels, it follows logically that prices should decrease with greater BESS implementation. 12 However, certain factors may potentially undermine the anticipated effect of price reduction as demand decreases. The efficient market theory, as expounded by Malkiel (2005), posits that in an efficient market, prices accurately reflect all publicly available information. According to Fama (1970), with a semi-strong form of the efficient market theory, we should expect that a decrease in demand would result in a decrease in prices. This would align with what many would expect with the introduction of BESSs. According to a report by GDS Associates (2022), CAISO has not given efficient market signals during periods of high demand and low supply, leading to inefficient incentives for supply production. This could lead us to possibly reject that CAISO is an efficient market, and potentially be a major reason why our results do not agree with the theory in the rest of this section. The Role of Natural Gas and Energy Imports The 2 other “market fundamentals” as discussed by Joskow & Kahn (2001), as well as Wang et al. (2022), are the prices of natural gas, and the availability of energy imports. Their study revealed a positive correlation between natural gas prices and electricity prices, and a negative correlation between the availability of power imports and electricity imports. This means that when natural gas prices rise, there is a rise in electricity prices and when the availability of energy imports decreases there is an increase in electricity prices. Some things have changed since 2001 in the Californian energy landscape, and during the period of our study, we found that import availability remained relatively consistent, except for in late 2022 when the war in Ukraine caused a natural gas shortage. Therefore, this is accounted for in the price of natural gas variable, and we will not use the availability of energy imports as a control variable. In the empirical analysis, we predict that the variable for natural gas prices should be positive, indicating that peak prices increase when natural gas prices increase. Hypothesis We hypothesize that the increased utilization of BESS will lead to a decrease in peak electricity prices within the CAISO energy market. Our hypothesis statement stems from the premise that increased BESS deployment allows for greater implementation and usage of renewable energy sources which in turn increases the merit order effect on electricity prices and decreases load demand on traditional generators. Through empirical analysis, we aim to demonstrate that as BESS adoption grows, the associated benefits of improved grid stability, demand response, and 13 integration of renewable energies will exert downward pressure on peak electricity prices. This hypothesis forms the basis for our research, which seeks to elucidate the economic implications of BESS deployment within the energy sector. Based on the theoretical argumentation we state the following hypothesis: Increased utalization of BESSs leads to a decrease in peak electricity prices within the CAISO energy market. 4. Literature Review The following chapter will review past research and studies on BESSs and their economic viability and relevance in the electricity grid. By exploring the landscape surrounding BESSs and previous findings we can provide insight into the current state of knowledge between the relationship between BESSs and electricity prices. 4.1 Previous Studies We begin by looking at previous case studies and simulations conducted in actual electricity markets where BESSs were introduced in order to gain perspective on what are their real effects in an electricity market. In a case study performed by Abdullah et al. (2021), they analyzed the effects that the introduction of BESSs would have in Malaysia. Their analysis revealed that the usage of BESSs, primarily to mitigate concerns with variable renewable energy integration, resulted in peak demand reduction for the sites selected. The authors discussed the potential for consumers to experience savings on their electricity bills due to the displacement of expensive ancillary services. Additionally, they concluded that the implementation of BESSs would increase the growth rate of renewable energies and increase consumer cost savings. Similarly, a case study in India found nearly the same results (Gandhok & Manthri, 2022). A simulation of the Indian electricity market with the introduction of BESSs indicated that displacing traditional diesel gas generators could result in cost savings for consumers through reduced electricity costs. Moreover, a study conducted on the Swedish electricity market reported findings consistent with those 14 observed in India and Malaysia (Abran et al., 2021). The study concluded that BESSs are most efficiently utilized to reduce peak demand and keep the power subscription level below 100%, preventing ancillary services from having to come online. Furthermore, a broad analysis of BESSs by Prakash et al. (2022) found that they are able to effectively relieve pressure from ancillary services by flattening peak demand. Although the majority of studies found relatively similar results, a study performed by Karaduman (2021) offered a slightly different perspective. The study analyzed the South Australian Electricity Market (SAEM) with BESS implementation. While the study did indicate an increase in consumer welfare and a reduction in electricity production costs, he found that the initial fixed costs associated with BESSs were too large to be economically viable. What is important to mention about this study is that the SAEM has a very similar level of variable renewable energy production as California and operates its electricity market in a very similar way, which raises questions as to the viability of BESSs in California. A large gap in the existing literature pertains to the scarcity of research addressing the actual market effects stemming from the integration of BESSs into grid systems. While numerous simulations have been conducted, there remains a lack of studies examining the real-world impacts of BESS introduction from the grid perspective. There is great importance in figuring this out, as it directly influences assessments of the economic viability of BESSs, as well as informs cost-benefit analyses for future implementation. We will contribute to existing research by analyzing the real price and battery data from CAISO to get a realistic idea of the actual effects that BESSs have on peak prices. As a secondary contribution, we offer research that is performed in a developed country, while most of the available literature has been conducted in developing countries. This empirical evidence can subsequently serve as a valuable resource for conducting comprehensive cost-benefit analyses and further research into the effectiveness and societal welfare implications of BESS technologies. 15 4.2 Economic Viability As the demand for sustainable energy solutions continues to rise, understanding the economic viability of BESSs becomes important to illustrate the importance and future relevance of BESSs effects within the electricity market. The most prevalent use of BESSs has been as ancillary services (Karaduman 2021), which are services that are brought online to aid the grid and bring extra electricity to the grid at a moment’s notice. Traditionally these services have been performed by expensive, dirty, and inefficient generators (Praskash et al. 2022; Robbins 2022). This, paired with energy arbitrage, is where BESSs predominately earn revenue from. BESSs buy at low, often negative, prices and sell the energy later in the day at a much higher price as previously illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. Using batteries as ancillary services extends their lifespan by avoiding deep charging/discharging cycles and is their main use in California. The net market revenue for BESSs increased to $103/kW in 2022 from $73/kW in 2021, primarily driven by higher peak energy prices (CAISO Battery Report, 2023). Analytical findings on the economic viability of BESSs vary substantially. Yu & Foggo (2017) discuss how there is a lack of knowledge of the investment risks of energy storage because of the inherent risks and complete unpredictability of electricity markets. The volatility of electricity prices surpasses even that of financial markets, rendering the value of energy storage highly uncertain. Consequently, it is unsurprising that numerous studies offer conflicting perspectives, with some asserting their profitability and others arguing to the contrary. A study by Abran et al. (2021), which examines the Swedish electricity market with BESSs, concluded that current technology costs are too high to justify investment in BESSs, but a 50% decrease in battery costs would allow for profitability. However, papers such as those written by Abdullah et al. (2021) and Gandhok & Manthri (2022) concluded that only the use of BESSs for ancillary services makes them economically viable for use. A study by Porzio et al. (2023) supported this conclusion by stating that the most effective use of BESSs is to eliminate these dirty ancillary services. However, he finds that it is not economically feasible to replace all ancillary services in a region with BESSs, as having enough storage to be able to handle all peaks increases the costs to a level where they would no longer be profitable. 16 Given the mixed findings regarding the economic viability of BESSs, Kumar et al. (2021) advocate for government intervention to subsidize BESS implementation. They contend that the positive externalities associated with BESS implementation, particularly in facilitating the integration of renewable energies and promoting environmental sustainability, warrant policy intervention. 5. Data and Methodology 5.1 Data Our study focuses on peak electricity prices and BESS usage in the CAISO energy market between 2018 and 2024, utilizing average weekly values. The primary explanatory variable under analysis is the peak battery usage in the grid, represented as a percentage of total energy supplied. Battery data was sourced directly from CAISO’s official website. To calculate peak battery usage, we identified the highest reported battery usage per week by CAISO and determined the corresponding total usage at that same time. The percentage of total usage attributed to batteries was then computed. Weekly values were chosen due to time constraints inherent to this bachelor's thesis, as processing daily data was not feasible within the available timeframe. Moreover, we observed minimal fluctuations in battery usage within any given week, leading us to believe that weekly data would yield comparable insights to daily data. A total of 157 observations were collected for the BESS variable and 313 observations for the other variables. They differ because only Model 2, which analyzes the effect of increasing utilization of BESSs on peak electricity prices from 2021-2024, utilizes this variable. All other variables are used in Model 1, which analyzes the effect that the introduction of BESSs into the grid had on peak prices during 2018-2024. In this model, BESS usage is represented as a dummy variable and the time frame is longer, explaining the greater number of observations for the other variables. BESS usage is taken as a percentage of total electricity load supplied because of many reasons. Firstly, it provides a standardized metric for comparing battery usage across different time periods, as it is independent of seasonal fluctuations. Secondly, it enables a clearer depiction of the 17 trajectory of BESS usage over time. Figure 2 from Section 2 illustrates this variable from 2021- 2024. Our response variable, peak electricity prices, was aggregated on a weekly basis using data obtained from LCG Consulting, a consulting firm contracted by CAISO for price forecasting and simulation. Unlike the price data available directly from CAISO’s website, LCG Consulting’s dataset provides average prices across all nodes every 5 minutes, ensuring comprehensive coverage. This data source is esteemed for its accuracy and reliability, having been utilized in reports by the US Energy Information Administration (Namovicz, 2017). We calculated the weekly average of peak prices by averaging the highest price recorded each day throughout the week. In addition to the main explanatory variable, we incorporated two control variables to enhance the robustness of our regression analysis and isolate the effects of BESSs on peak electricity prices. These control variables include natural gas prices and peak load demand, both aggregated on a weekly basis. We include natural gas prices and peak load demand because, as discussed in Section 3, they have been identified as “market determinants”. Weekly closing prices of natural gas were obtained from the New York Mercantile. Load demand data was also acquired from LCG Consulting, where the same operation was performed as on peak electricity prices to aggregate the data into weekly averages. Figures 6 and 7 demonstrate the substantial explanatory power of these two variables in explaining the variance in electricity prices within CAISO, affirming their inclusion as control variables in our analysis, supported both by our findings and existing literature. 18 Figure 6: Development of Peak Electricity Prices and Natural Gas Prices Over Time in CAISO from 2018-2024 (Own Calculations) Figure 7: Development of Peak Electricity Prices and Peak Load Demand Over Time in CAISO from 2018 to 2024 (Own Calculations) 19 Time Frame All of our data is aggregated on a weekly basis from the first week of 2018 to the first week of 2024. We choose to use weekly data because of the relatively stable nature of our data on a daily basis. As shown in Figure 8, the day-to-day fluctuations are minimal, while in the long run, there is a notable increase (Figure 2). Therefore, weekly data suffices to capture the overarching trends without sacrificing significant granularity. Both peak electricity prices and load demand are presented as average weekly values to provide a comprehensive view of their trends over time. Utilizing weekly averages mitigates the influence of isolated days with exceptionally high or low prices, allowing for a more accurate representation of the overall pricing dynamics. Natural gas price is given as the weekly closing price because of the limited movement in the price. This approach ensures that the data aligns with the broader analysis and facilitates meaningful comparisons across variables. Figure 8: Annual Weekly Snapshot of Peak BESS Utilization, Week of June 1st. in CAISO (Own Calculations) 20 While batteries were initially integrated into the CAISO grid around 2016 (Kiefer, 2016), data pertaining to the charging and discharging of BESSs only became available in 2020. Capacity data from CAISO indicates minimal changes until 2021, suggesting negligible contribution from batteries to grid supply prior to 2021. Given that batteries accounted for less than 0.5% of peak supply at the beginning of 2020, it is reasonable to assume zero supply of batteries in 2018 and 2019. This approach allows us to analyze peak prices both before and after the introduction of batteries, providing a more accurate assessment of their impact. 5.2 Method To examine the relationship between peak electricity prices and BESS usage, we will perform 2 time series analyses incorporating two other control variables. The first analysis will cover the years 2018-2024 and include a dummy variable for batteries to assess the impact of the introduction of batteries in the CAISO electricity market. The second analysis will focus on the years 2021-2024 specifically evaluating the impact of increasing battery usage on prices. We include two control variables in the time series analysis to help better understand the relation between BESS usage and peak electricity prices. A time series analysis is a widely used method to show the relationship between variables over a defined period within a specific area. Since we are looking at a determined time frame within a single electricity market, this approach aligns with standard time series analysis practices. Incorporating a dummy variable is a common strategy in time series analysis to gauge the effect of a particular change on the outcome variable. This binary variable, denoted as either before batteries (0) or after batteries (1), allows us to discern the impact of the introduction of batteries without measuring the varying utilization levels of batteries. Consequently, we opted to conduct two separate regressions to capture these distinct elements. In addition to the main time series analysis, we will also perform several robustness checks in Section 6.3 to ensure the quality of our analysis. Robustness checks are standard practice when running regressions to validate the results against alternative explanations or biases (Catherine et al., 2022). We will perform autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, stationarity, multicollinearity, and 21 inflation robustness checks on our data to ensure proper results. Stationarity is checked by using the unit root test. We checked for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity by running Breusch- Godfrey and Breusch-Pagan tests, respectively. To correct for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity issues, we will employ Newey-West standard errors in our regressions. Model In order to test our main hypothesis, as stated in Section 3, with a time series analysis we must develop a model which allows us to estimate the relationship between our independent and dependent variables. Time series regressions are commonly used in the forecasting of day-ahead electricity prices, by analyzing previous load and price data (Wang et al., 2022). This, along with the fact that we are analyzing a single region across a period of time, is our motivation for using a time series fixed effect model. We apply the general time series formula as given by Imai & Kim (2019) to create our models. For our first model, we use a dummy variable to capture the effects of the introduction of BESSs onto the CAISO market. Therefore, our first model conducted for the time period 2018-2024 will be: PeakPriceₜ = β₀ + β₁Dₜ + β₂NatGasPriceₜ + β₃Loadₜ + α + εₜ (1) Where PeakPriceₜ is the weekly aggregated peak price data, NatGasPriceₜ is the weekly natural gas price, Loadₜ is the weekly aggregated peak load demand, and εₜ is the unobservable error term. Dₜ is the dummy variable, taking the value 0 for any time before 2021 and the value 1 for any time after 2021 which is when we imply that batteries have been introduced to the grid. The average contemporaneous effect of the variables effect on PeakPriceₜ is described by β. The fixed intercept variable, α, captures time-invariant factors that may affect the regression and is only utilized when we run the time fixed effects model. Table 1 shows a list of all included variables. 22 Variable Name Variable Definition PeakPriceₜ Weekly aggregated peak electricity price BESSpercentₜ Weekly peak supply of electricity from BESS as a percent of total supply NatGasPriceₜ Weekly price of natural gas Loadₜ Weekly aggregated peak load demand Our second model uses no dummy variable and includes a variable which measures the level of usage of BESSs. This model is intended to give us a more detailed picture into the effects of increasing usage of BESSs on peak electricity prices. Our model for the period of 2021-2024 will be: PeakPriceₜ = β₀ + β₁BESSpercentₜ+ β₂NatGasPriceₜ + β₃Loadₜ + α + εₜ (2) All variables are the same as the previous model except for that we replaced the dummy variable with another explanatory variable: BESSpercentₜ; which represents the peak percentage utilization of BESS per week. We include time fixed effects as a separate specification in our model. We did this because there are most likely time variant omitted variables that are correlated with our chosen variables that we cannot observe, and we would like to control for these effects. These effects vary over time but are constant in relation to our variables. 6. Results and Analysis 6.1 Descriptive Statistics This section will provide descriptive statistics for both models. Table 1 below provides descriptive statistics for all variables included in our models. Here we can observe that there is a great amount of variability in all of the variables over the time period of 23 2018-2024 (2021-2024 for BESS). We find that the average peak electricity price is $261.54/Megawatt, with a large degree of variation as the standard deviation is nearly 50% of the mean and the max price is 3 times as large as the mean. For max load demand, it is a similar case. An average peak load demand of 30,245 Megawatts, with a considerably smaller standard deviation. Natural gas prices appear to have quite a lot of volatility from this table, but these results are most likely a consequence of the natural gas shortage and subsequent price hike in late 2022. Variable Obs Mean Std. dev. Min Max PeakPrice 313 261.54 194.85 39.181 1041.37 BESS 157 7.208 4.372 0.663 18.051 NatGasPrice 313 3.449 1.676 1.545 9.335 Load 313 30244.95 4790.17 21598 46893.43 Table 1: Descriptive Statistics Along with these data points, we also collected the time of day where the peak battery usage occurred to see if there was any relationship between BESS peak usage and peak electricity demand times. Figure 9 shows our findings. We found that before 2021, when the usage of BESSs were still quite limited, the timings of their use appears very random and uncoordinated. Almost directly after 2021, the peak use time of BESSs appears to form a pattern which seasonally fluctuates around 18h-20h. This helps to illustrate that the peak usage of BESSs were almost always during the peak electricity load demand which is experienced in the evening. 24 Figure 9: Peak BESS Usage Time of Day in California from 2020-2024 (Own Calculations) We also analyzed the frequency of extreme electricity price peaks. We define extreme peaks as an average weekly peak price of greater than $300/Megawatt. Our results are shown below in Figure 10. We found that there was a significant decrease in extreme peak occurrences from 2018 to 2023. We cannot draw any conclusions based on this evidence, but it does support the notion that BESSs have helped the grid gain stability from extreme price swings. 25 Figure 10: Yearly Frequency of Average Weekly Peak Price Greater Than $300/MW in California from 2018 to 2023 (Own Calculations) 6.2 Empirical Findings This section will describe the empirical findings on the regressions of both of our models. Some of our models are specified as without outliers. We specify outliers as peak electricity prices that reach over $500 per Megawatt. We added this as an alternate specification because there were relatively few of these extreme peaks and when looking at the data, they usually only last for 5 minutes, then decrease to more reasonable prices. This phenomenon may be attributed to timing discrepancies, such as generators coming online slightly delayed, resulting in transient price spikes. By excluding these we get better R-squared results, suggesting that these outliers were distorting the data set. Before looking at our two main models, Table 2 presents the results of two regressions ran solely with our control variables. One ran from 2018 – 2021, labeled “Before Batteries”, and the second from 2021-2024, labeled “After Batteries”. All variables are highly significant, although we find a relatively small R-squared for the Before Batteries regression. The results for load are relatively 26 consistent, showing that for a 1 Gigawatt (1000 Megawatts) increase in load demand, peak prices increase on average $3.80 Before Batteries and $3.20 After Batteries. Natural Gas Prices follow a similar pattern, since when there is a $1 increase in the price of natural gas, there is a $27.74 increase in peak prices Before Batteries, which decreases to $13.95 After Batteries.

This regression is used to understand the main general effects that the introduction of BESSs has had on peak electricity prices. Additionally, the table presents results from a regression composed solely of the dummy variable and peak prices. 27 Table 3: Regression Results 2018 – 2024 Dependent Variable: PeakPrice (1) (2) (3) (4) Independent Variables OLS w/o Controls OLS OLS w/o Outliers TFE Dummy -145.35*** (20.466) -190.60*** (23.700) -25.57 *** (8.131) -307.16* (168.744) Load 0.0022 (0.0021) 0.0034 *** (0.00073) 0.0260 (0.00203) NatGasPrice 26.51*** (7.147) 14.92*** (2.452) 14.40 (11.285) Time Fixed Effects No No No Yes Observations 313 313 313 313 R-Squared 0.140 0.184 0.190 0.292 Note: Standard errors in parenthesis ***p<0.01, **p<0.05, * p<0.1 In Column 1, we found the dummy variable to be highly significant and overall negative with a relatively small R-squared. This tells us that peak electricity prices have decreased significantly since the introduction of BESSs into CAISO’s electrical grid. More specifically, after the inclusion of the dummy variable, there was a $145.35 decrease in peak prices on average. This finding holds in Column 2, where the dummy variable is significant and decreasing. After the inclusion of the control variables, peak electricity prices decrease on average by $190.60. Natural gas prices are significant and increasing as we predicted. Some possible explanations for the insignificant load demand are located in Section 7. Throughout all of our regressions, we found increasing R-squared values as we changed the specifications. Column 3 gives us the OLS regression but with outliers restricted. When we do this, all 3 variables become significant with the expected signs. Although the dummy variable value decreases significantly to a $25.57 decrease in prices after the introduction of the dummy variable. Lastly, in Column 4, we find insignificant load demand and natural gas price, with a weakly significant dummy variable. We propose this could be due to heterogeneity in our data, since BESSs may have more significant impacts on specific nodes than on others, or that the controlled time fixed effects explained a large amount of the variation which 28 was previously attributed to these variables. It could also be due to autocorrelation issues which are discussed further in Section 6.3. Overall, we find a significant negative link between BESSs and peak electricity prices although it turns insignificant in the TFE regression. The overall decrease in peak prices is quite economically significant since the mean peak price without outliers from Table 1 is $261.54. However, the result from Column 3 is less important when compared to the mean value. Model 2 The results for the OLS and TFE regressions for model 2 from 2021–2024 are summarized in Table 4. This model is used to look closer at the effects of increasing BESS usage on peak electricity prices. Table 4: Regression Results 2021 - 2024 Dependent Variable: PeakPrice (1) (2) (3) (4) Independent Variables OLS w/o Controls OLS OLS w/o Outliers TFE BESS -4.91** (2.457) -3.11 (2.270) 0.48 (1.134) -4.34 (5.468) Load 0.0063*** (0.00215) 0.0032*** (0.0011) 0.0060*** (0.00230) NatGasPrice 20.543*** (5.385) 14.118*** (2.690) 23.012** (10.000) Time Fixed Effects No No No Yes Observations 157 157 157 157 R-Squared 0.025 0.200 0.253 0.200 Note: Standard errors in parenthesis ***p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0.1 29 In Column 1, when including no other control variables, BESS is significant at a 95% confidence level. When the percentage of BESS usage as a share of supply increases by 1%, peak prices, on average, decrease by $4.91. Although the value of BESS is decreasing, the economic significance is limited since the mean value of peak prices in Table 1 is $261.54. The R-squared for this result is also quite low, indicating a quite low goodness of fit for this regression. When introducing the control variables, BESS becomes insignificant. Column 2 shows an insignificant BESS, with significant values for load demand and natural gas price. This trend continues in Columns 3 and 4. R-squared values rose over the first 3 Columns but decreased in Column 4 with the TFE regression. Overall, in model 2, we find that BESS has no significant impact on peak prices. This leads us to reject our hypothesis as stated in Section 3 since there is no evidence to prove a decreasing effect on peak electricity prices due to the increasing use of BESSs. 6.3 Robustness Checks In this section we will provide certain robustness checks that we used to check the validity of our data. We perform robustness checks for inflation, stationarity, autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, and multicollinearity. Since we are conducting a study which uses historical prices, inflation is a key metric to account for when analyzing the results as it makes prices further from the past smaller than they were at that time. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was sourced from The Federal Reserve Economic Data. CPI is given every month, and we decided to assign the same value to every week that was in that month to make the data fit the data set. We decided not to include CPI in our main models because we found nearly the same results without it, and it overcomplicated the analysis by including broader economic factors. Therefore, we analyze it only as a robustness check. In the Appendix under Table A.5, we find very similar results to model 1 in Section 6.2. However, we find the dummy variable to be insignificant. In Table A.6 in the Appendix, the results of model 2 with CPI included as a control variable are shown in detail. We find nearly identical results here as found in Section 6.2. We therefore conclude that inflation did not significantly change our results. 30 Stationarity is an important assumption of time series analysis, which means that the statistical properties of the time series do not change over time. Having stationarity issues could result in skewed parameter estimates. To test the stationarity of our models, we employed the Dickey-Fuller Unit Root Test. Detailed results are available in Table A.3 in the Appendix. We reject the null hypothesis, meaning that the dependent variable exhibits stationarity, aligning with the crucial stationarity assumption. We also checked multicollinearity, which is the presence of strong correlations among independent variables. This can distort coefficient estimates and hinder the interpretation of relationships between variables. It is important to ensure that the independent variables are not excessively correlated. Table 5 details the outcome of the correlation matrix between the 4 variables in our model. We find no strong correlations between any of the variables and conclude that multicollinearity is not a concern in our model. Additionally, we performed the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test to detect multicollinearity among the independent variables. This can be found in the Appendix under Table A.4. We also found no signs of multicollinearity. Table 5: Correlation Matrix Correlation Matrix PeakPrice BESS NatGasPrice Load PeakPrice 1 BESS -0.0431 1 NatGasPrice 0.4562 -0.1576 1 Load 0.3440 -0.0527 0.3161 1 Autocorrelation, also known as serial correlation, occurs when the error terms in a regression model are correlated with each other. This violates one of the key assumptions of regression analysis, which is the independence of error terms. Autocorrelation can lead to biased parameter estimates, inflated standard errors, and incorrect inferences about the significance of coefficients. In our study, we conducted the Breusch-Godfrey test for autocorrelation to assess the presence of serial correlation in the residuals of our regression model. The null hypothesis of this test is that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals. A rejection of the null hypothesis suggests evidence of autocorrelation. Our analysis revealed a significant p-value of 0 at different lags, indicating strong 31 evidence against the null hypothesis and confirming the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals for all specifications of the 2018-2024 regression, although only the OLS regression without outliers in the 2021-2024 regression had a problem with autocorrelation. This does have implications for the reliability of our standard errors and p-values. A detailed depiction of the results are available in the Appendix under Table A.2. Next, we address concerns of heteroskedasticity. Heteroskedasticity occurs when the variance of the residuals in a regression model is not constant across all levels of the independent variables. The violation of the OLS assumption of no homoskedasticity can lead to biased standard error estimates and unreliable regression coefficients. In order to check our model for heteroskedasticity, we plotted the residuals, shown in the Appendix under Figure A.1, where we found clustering of values which indicated the presence of autocorrelation. We also used the Breusch-Pagan test to check for heteroskedasticity, shown in the appendix under Table A.1, where we found a significant p-value leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis. This supports the notion that there is heteroskedasticity present in our data. In order to address the issues of autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, which violate two of the OLS assumptions, we have decided to use the Newey-West standard errors. These address the issues by adjusting the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates to account for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity by incorporating lagged values of the residuals into the estimation process. This helps to capture the temporal dependence in the data and adjust the standard errors accordingly. The detailed results of the test are shown below in the Appendix in Figure A.7 and A.8. After the application of the Newey-West standard errors we find nearly no change in the regression results, with only slight increases in the significance of variables in the TFE model (Column 4 Table A.8). 6.4 Limitations This section will acknowledge some of the limitations that may impact the interpretation and generalizability of the findings. Firstly, the decision to use weekly aggregated data for our analysis for reasons previously discussed in Section 5. While we anticipate minimal impact on our results, we acknowledge the potential for greater precision by utilizing daily data to capture more nuanced variations. Furthermore, we 32 recognize a limitation with the broadness of our scope. We choose to analyze the entire CAISO, where the deployment of BESSs may vary across different nodes, potentially yielding divergent effects. Due to the absence of data regarding the usage of BESSs at individual nodes, we opted for an analysis which analyzed CAISO in its entirety. Notably, CAISO covers a very large and diverse area, with vastly differing population densities and environments which may introduce unaccounted disparities in electricity prices. Additionally, we identified a potential limitation with the limited inclusion of control variables. We only included two control variables in our model which, while both highly significant, did not provide a very large R-squared, indicating there is room for improvement for the inclusion of variables which can explain the variation of peak electricity prices other than BESS usage. Some control variables that could be of significance to the model could be the percentage of renewable energy generation as a percent of supply, temperature, and transmission costs. These limitations in our study offer opportunities for further research discussed in Section 8. 7. Discussion In the first part of our analysis where we evaluate the impact of BESSs on a before-after analysis, we find a significant decrease in peak electricity prices after the introduction of BESSs which we represented as the years 2018-2024. In this model, we found load to be not significant, which we suggest could be due to the extreme price peaks. These extreme prices which can reach over $1000/Megawatt only last for one 5-minute interval and could be the cause of a momentary supply side unalignment of supply and demand, or extreme weather phenomenon (Tertre, 2023; Leggett, 2024). This is supported by the results in Table 3 Column 3 where outliers are omitted, and load becomes significant with a positive sign. There was a decrease of $190.60 (Table 3, Column 2), which is a large reduction when comparing the value to the mean peak electricity price of $261.54 (Table 1, Column 2). This decrease depends on the model applied, for example in Table 3 Column 3 we see a much smaller decrease of $25.57. From these results, we can conclude that the variation in peak electricity prices appears to decrease, and prices are more “stable” after 2021 than from 2018-2021, although the amount varies with the specifications of the test used. 33 Even though these results are consistent with our hypothesis, this model does not include the actual usage of BESSs and the specific impacts that an increase in its use had on peak electricity prices. When analyzing the specific impacts of BESSs on peak electricity prices in the OLS model with BESS usage as a dependent variable, we found that BESSs had no significant effect on peak electricity prices (Table 4). This finding was consistent across all specifications except for the initial regression ran with only BESS as an independent variable (Table 4, Column 1). Here we found a slightly significant decreasing value for BESS, although with a small R-squared. However, we discard this result because this effect becomes completely insignificant when controlling for other factors that influence peak prices, signifying the existence of omitted variable bias in this estimate. Additionally, since these estimates did not change after the introduction of the Newey- West standard errors, we can conclude that autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity are unlikely to be the cause of this insignificance. We offer many possible explanations for this non-effect. Firstly, it could be possible that current BESS usage is still not a large enough share of electricity supplied to have a significant impact on the peak prices of electricity. Articles such as one from Jarbratt et al. (2023) often talk about the potential for the reduction of energy prices in the future, an 80% reduction by 2030 per this article. Secondly, as discussed in Section 2, the efficient market theory does not appear to hold in CAISO during periods of peak demand, meaning that the peak prices in CAISO do not accurately reflect all publicly available information. This could potentially be a reason for our results as even though the increased use of BESSs should theoretically decrease prices, we find no evidence in the data. Furthermore, in a study by German & Roncoroni (2006), they analyzed a summer of exceptionally high electricity prices in CAISO and concluded that the prices did not accurately reflect the market conditions and that utility companies would frequently exercise their market power by increasing prices higher than can be explained by normal market dynamics. When looking at Table 2, we can see a decrease in the coefficient of NatGasPrice after the introduction of batteries into the grid. This alteration suggests a shift in the relationship; whereas previously a $1 increase in natural gas price corresponded to a $27.74 increase in PeakPrice, this relationship diminishes to a $13.95 increase. This could indicate that BESSs has had a mitigating effect on the influence of natural gas prices on peak electricity prices. Which could be because BESSs provide a form of energy storage that can be used to offset the need for natural gas generation during peak demand periods. Thereby reducing the sensitivity of peak electricity prices 34 to fluctuations in natural gas. This topic could be of particular interest for further studies considering the market effects of BESSs. In the middle of our time frame, the global COVID-19 pandemic was a major shock to various markets around the world. The pandemic primarily resulted in a reduction in overall electricity demand (IEA, 2021), which is already controlled for within our model. Therefore, we do not anticipate this posing a concern in our regression analysis. Conversely, the war in Ukraine and subsequent shortage of natural gas had a substantial visible impact on the prices as shown previously in Figure 6 in the weeks directly after 2022. We have controlled this using natural gas prices as a control variable in our model. Although we found no significant effects on peak prices from the increased use of BESSs, and only a possible slight effect from them in the before and after analysis, BESSs appear to be here to stay due to their environmental and grid stability effects, which is likely to make them a feature of electricity markets worldwide (Jarbratt et al., 2023). In the future it could be possible to observe decreasing prices because of BESSs, and the restructuring of current gird market dynamics to allow for more efficient allocation of electricity, for both suppliers and consumers (Antweiler & Müsgens, 2024). As our limitations have outlined previously in Section 6.3, there are many opportunities for further research, not to mention how unexplored this topic is in academic studies. Although BESS did not have an effect on peak electricity prices from 2021-2024, we propose that this could be because of unincluded variables that could have had a large impact on this relationship, this is supported the decrease in peak prices found in the first model, as well as the frequency of extreme peaks table (Figure 10). With believe further research into this topic could offer differing results by altering the methods and data set. By including only specific nodes affected by BESSs, it could be possible to see a different result than what we have found. We suggest that future studies should continue to search for further uncorrelated variables for inclusion within the model. We also suggest that further studies should either wait until there is a greater inclusion of BESSs in the grid supply or develop a simulation to simulate an increased use of BESSs to understand how BESSs affect electricity prices with greater usage of batteries. 35 8. Conclusion Battery integration into the grid represents a burgeoning and increasingly prominent aspect of the electricity network. A thorough understanding of the effects that BESSs exert on peak electricity pricing enables us to accurately gauge the implications of this emergent technology from the consumers' standpoint. This paper undertook an analysis of how the heightened utilization of BESSs in the CAISO energy region influenced peak electricity pricing. When considering the overarching impact of BESS introduction on the grid, as examined in the before-after analysis, a decrease in peak electricity prices after the introduction of BESSs is found. However, upon delving deeper into the specific ramifications of increased BESS utilization, as explored in the analysis from 2021-2024, no significant relationship between BESS usage and peak electricity prices was observed. This finding contradicts assertions made in several papers and articles, most notably one authored by the Californian Energy Commission (2021). We propose several explanations for this lack of effect, including inefficiencies within the CAISO market, the relatively low share of BESSs in the supply, or the potentially broad scope of our study. The outcome of our analysis may have differed had we scrutinized specific nodes with higher proportions of BESS energy utilization, or if we had examined a market with a greater BESS share. Nevertheless, our study did reveal a reduction in the occurrence of exceptionally high peak price events, thereby supporting the notion of a more stable power market. Despite the absence of a tangible reduction in peak electricity prices, BESSs possess several noteworthy attributes that are likely to exert a significant future impact on electrical grids and markets. California is particularly suitable for BESS utilization due to its high share of renewable energy generation compared to other regions within the U.S. The social benefits of BESSs increase when used in a system with renewable energy sources. There appears to be a symbiotic relationship between BESSs and renewable energy sources, as increased BESS usage also increases the effectiveness of renewable energy sources. Some policy implications that we offer as a result of our study include incentivizing BESS adoption through subsidies or tax credits, eventual wholesale electricity market reform due to the increased prevalence of the merit order effect, and increasing regulatory support for grid integration from both the producer and consumer side. 36 Further research could investigate the relationship between BESSs and electricity prices in general, composing a study that is broader in scope beside only peak electricity prices. Another suggestion is for further research to analyze this effect on a nodal level to try and better understand the effects BESSs have since BESSs are heterogeneously distributed. We also suggest that further studies try and either create simulations with a larger percentage of BESS usage or wait until a region reaches a more substantial capacity of BESSs since this most likely allows for BESSs to have a greater and more noticeable effect on peak electricity prices. 37 References Abdullah, W.
