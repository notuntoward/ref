The underlying survey data used to p ro duce the ratings is co llected daily. Ratings are narro wly deﬁned to reﬂect the average degree o f p ublic ap p ro val o f the incumbent chief executive and o f their co untry’s trajecto ry in each rated market. Fo r co rp o rates, the ratings are intended to facilitate scenario p lanning and risk management eﬀo rts.

Ratings Design 2A. Underlying Concepts Mo rning Co nsult's Glo bal Po litical Risk Ratings p ro vide high-freq uency, survey-derived risk ratings fo r 36 glo bal markets o n a mo nthly basis. The underlying survey data used to p ro duce the ratings is co llected daily. Ratings are narro wly deﬁned to reﬂect the average degree o f p ublic ap p ro val o f the incumbent chief executive and o f their co untry’s trajecto ry in each rated market. 2B. Ratings Construction Fo r each rated market, Mo rning Co nsult's Glo bal Po litical Risk Ratings are deﬁned as the simp le intra-mo nth average o f two co mp o nent data series: (1) the net share o f adults who ap p ro ve o f the incumbent chief executive (“net leader ap p ro val”) and (2) the net share o f adults who say their co untry is mo ving in the right directio n (“net right directio n” o r alternatively, “net co untry trajecto ry”), bo th scaled o n the -100 to 100 interval. To co mp ute the risk ratings, we ﬁrst take the daily average o f the two co mp o nent series, and subseq uently co mp ute the intra-mo nth mean o f the resulting values, yielding a mo nthly “risk reading” ranging fro m -100 to 100. Readings are subseq uently ro unded to the nearest who le number and map p ed o nto an o rdinal ratings band scale, yielding mo nthly “risk ratings” ranging fro m AAA to U (unstable). Readings are no t no rmalized o r rescaled to p reserve range alignment with the underlying co mp o nent data series, which similarly range fro m -100 to 100. Ratings o f BBB- o r higher, co mmo nly used to deno te the cuto ﬀ fo r investment grade markets and/o r assets, 2 co rresp o nds to risk readings abo ve zero in Mo rning Co nsult’s ratings scale, reﬂecting net-p o sitive p ublic sentiment. Table A2 (see Ap p endix) p ro vides co mp lete survey q uestio n wo rding and scales fo r each co mp o nent data series, and o utlines the transfo rmatio ns used to p ro duce the co mp o site risk readings. Table A3 (see Ap p endix) p ro vides a co mp lete map p ing fro m risk readings to ratings bands. 2 See S&P Glo bal Ratings. 2022. Guide to Credit Rating Essentials. p .9.. See also Fitch Ratings.

Additional Information on Component Data Series The co mp o nent data used to p ro vide Mo rning Co nsult’s Po litical Risk Ratings derives fro m a standard battery o f daily surveys ﬁelded in each rated market using no n-p ro bability samp ling metho ds. All survey interviews are co nducted o nline. Data is co llected using q uo ta samp ling and weighted daily to rep resent the target p o p ulatio n within each market. The target p o p ulatio n reﬂects the 18+ general p o p ulatio n, literate p o p ulatio n, o r internet-using p o p ulatio n dep ending o n market facto rs. Weighting p arameters vary by market. Samp le sizes similarly vary by market, ranging fro m ap p ro ximately several hundred to several tho usand resp o ndents p er day. The co mp o nent data used to p ro duce the ratings reﬂects survey resp o nses amo ng adults (ages 18+ ) in each surveyed market.

Key Ratings Terminology Mo rning Co nsult issues mo nthly “ratings actio n,” “ratings watches,” and “risk trajecto ries” based o n variatio n in underlying risk readings in each rated market. Mo rning Co nsult also issues mo nthly “fo rward o utlo o ks” fo r markets subject to ratings actio n (i.e. up grades/do wngrades) and fo r select markets subject to ratings watches. This sectio n describes each co ncep t in detail, alo ng with related vo latility and co nﬁdence metrics. Table A1 (see Ap p endix) p ro vides a summary o f all key termino lo gy discussed herein. Table A3 (see Ap p endix) p ro vides a co mp lete listing o f all bands and their co rresp o nding no tches. 3A. Ratings Risk “ratings” reﬂect markets’ assignment into o rdinal ratings ranging fro m AAA (the highest rating, reﬂecting the lo west risk level) to U (the lo west rating, reﬂecting the highest risk level) based o n their underlying risk readings. All letter ratings are no tched with p lus and minus sub-ratings (e.g. A+ , A-) with the excep tio n o f the lo west rating (U, co rresp o nding to “unstable”), referred to hereafter as “notches.” Table A3 (see Ap p endix) p ro vides a co mp lete listing o f all bands and their co rresp o nding no tches. “Ratings transitions” refer to a transitio n fro m o ne rating to ano ther. 3B. Ratings Action Mo rning Co nsult issues “ratings action” fo r rated markets o n a mo nthly basis indicating whether a market has exp erienced a ratings “upgrade” o r “downgrade,” deﬁned as a mo nth-o n-mo nth transitio n fro m a lo wer ratings band to a higher band (in the event o f an up grade), o r fro m a higher ratings band to a lo wer band (in the event o f a do wngrade). 3 Ratings bands include AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, and U. Table A3 (see Ap p endix) p ro vides a co mp lete listing o f all bands and their co rresp o nding no tches. Ratings actio n rep resents o ur mo st aggregate-level metric o f whether a rated market’s risk p ro ﬁle has changed. 3 Ratings actio n assessments are made based o n underlying risk readings ro unded to the nearest who le number p rio r to taking their mo nth-o n-mo nth diﬀerence. See additio nal discussio n o f risk readings belo w. 4 Markets that do no t exp erience a mo nth-o n-mo nth ratings transitio n are assessed as “stable,” reﬂecting a lack o f ratings actio n. Ratings actio ns always reﬂect either increasing mo nth-o n-mo nth risk readings (in the event o f an up grade) o r decreasing risk readings (in the event o f a do wngrade). By co ntrast, risk readings (see discussio n belo w) may increase o r decrease in the absence o f ratings actio n, reﬂecting changes in risk readings that fall sho rt o f a ratings transitio n. 3C. Ratings Watches Mo rning Co nsult issues “ratings watches” fo r rated markets o n a mo nthly basis indicating whether a market has exp erienced a transitio n fro m o ne ratings “no tch” to ano ther within the same letter band (e.g. fro m AA+ to AA, fro m BBB+ to BBB, fro m CCC to CCC-). Ratings watches rep resent o ur seco nd mo st aggregate-level metric o f whether a rated market’s risk p ro ﬁle has changed. 4 “Downside ratings watches” indicate a transitio n fro m a higher no tch to a lo wer no tch within the same band, indicating an increase in risk. “Upside ratings watches” indicate a transitio n fro m a lo wer no tch to a higher no tch within the same band, indicating a decrease in risk. Each ratings band aside fro m U has three no tches. Table A3 (see Ap p endix) p ro vides a co mp lete listing o f all bands and their co rresp o nding no tches. Ratings watches always reﬂect either increasing o r decreasing mo nth-o n-mo nth risk readings. By co ntrast, risk readings may increase o r decrease in the absence o f ratings watch issuance, reﬂecting changes in risk readings that fall sho rt o f a ratings transitio n. Markets fo r which Mo rning Co nsult has issued ratings actio n in a given mo nth are no t assigned ratings watches and are marked as “not applicable.” Additio nally, Mo rning Co nsult’s p o litical analysts may p erio dically issue a “discretionary ratings watch” in cases where they assess that a p articular market’s p o litical dynamics are wo rth mo nito ring absent the issuance o f a fo rmal ratings watch. The facto rs info rming such watches are described in detail in Mo rning Co nsult’s mo nthly Market Co mmentary & Risk Outlo o k (MACRO) Po litical Brieﬁngs. 3D. Risk Trajectories Mo rning Co nsult issues “risk trajectories” fo r rated markets o n a mo nthly basis indicating whether a market has exp erienced increasing o r decreasing “risk readings” mo nth-o n-mo nth, co rresp o nding to p o sitive and negative trajecto ries, resp ectively. “Risk trajecto ries” rep resent o ur mo st micro -level metric o f whether a rated market’s risk p ro ﬁle has changed. Markets that do no t exp erience a mo nth-o n-mo nth change in risk readings are assessed as “stable.” As distinct fro m ratings actio n and ratings watches, which are issued based o n ratings transitio ns, risk trajecto ries reﬂect mo vement in the underlying numeric risk readings scaled o n the -100 to 100 interval. As 4 Ratings actio n assessments are made based o n underlying risk readings ro unded to the nearest who le number p rio r to taking their mo nth-o n-mo nth diﬀerence. See additio nal discussio n o f risk readings belo w. 5 such, risk trajecto ries are assessed fo r every rated market o n a mo nthly basis regardless o f whether they have exp erienced ratings actio n o r a ratings watch. Table A3 (see Ap p endix) p ro vides a co mp lete map p ing o f risk readings o nto their resp ective bands and sub-bands. 3E. Companion Risk Trajectory Metrics: Volatility and Conﬁdence To facilitate mo re nuanced risk p ro ﬁle assessments, Mo rning Co nsult leverages intra-mo nth variability in market-sp eciﬁc risk readings to p ro duce vo latility and co nﬁdence metrics fo r all rated markets. The sectio ns belo w describe their use and measurement. 3E.1. Volatility Mo rning Co nsult deﬁnes volatility as the intra-mo nth standard deviatio n in the risk reading fo r a given rated market, ro unded to the nearest who le number, resulting in vo latility assessments o f “increasing,” “stable,” o r “decreasing.” Higher vo latility indicates greater disp ersio n o f a co untry’s intra-mo nth risk readings aro und the mean. In the co ntext o f Mo rning Co nsult’s Market Co mmentary & Risk Outlo o k (MACRO) Po litical Brieﬁngs, increasing vo latility is interp reted as a p o tential signal o f gro wing risk p ro ﬁle instability, while decreasing vo latility is interp reted as a p o tential signal o f gro wing risk p ro ﬁle stability. Vo latility assessments are no t p erfo rmed fo r newly rated markets fo r which less than a single mo nth o f data exists and therefo re p recludes them. Vo latility readings are dep endent o n daily samp le sizes in each rated market, which are variable acro ss markets. Vo latility readings sho uld therefo re o nly be co mp ared within markets acro ss time, and no t acro ss markets. 3E.2 Baseline Conﬁdence Co nﬁdence reﬂects a statistical assessment o f the risk trajecto ry fo r a rated market, reﬂecting the likeliho o d that a mo nth-o n-mo nth change in a market’s risk reading has o ccurred. Mo rning Co nsult derives baseline conﬁdence metrics fro m diﬀerence-in-means tests o f the intra-mo nth diﬀerence in risk readings fo r each rated market. To do so , we emp lo y two -samp le t-tests with uneq ual variances, where the tested mean is the intra-mo nth risk reading and the tested variance is derived fro m daily risk reading o bservatio ns within the indicated mo nth. Tests p ro viding statistical evidence o f mo nth-o n-mo nth diﬀerences are assigned a “medium” o r “high” conﬁdence, co rresp o nding to statistically signiﬁcant test results at the 10% and 5% levels o r higher, resp ectively. Rated markets who se mo nthly tests fail to meet either o f the abo ve signiﬁcance thresho lds are assigned “low” conﬁdence. Co nﬁdence assessments are no t p erfo rmed fo r newly rated markets fo r which a single mo nth o f data exists and therefo re p recludes them. 6 Table A4 (see Ap p endix) p ro vides a summary map p ing o f co nﬁdence assessments o nto statistical signiﬁcance. Because co nﬁdence assessments rely o n vo latility metrics as inp uts, co nﬁdence readings sho uld o nly be co mp ared within markets acro ss time, and no t acro ss markets. In additio n, markets co mmo nly exhibit marked risk adjustments in the windo w just after electio ns o r similar p o litical transitio ns. Intra-co untry co mp ariso ns o f co nﬁdence sho uld therefo re be attentive to sharp mo vements in co nﬁdence readings during such time p erio ds. 3F. Forward Outlooks Mo rning Co nsult issues mo nthly “fo rward o utlo o ks” fo r rated markets exp eriencing up grades/do wngrades and fo r select markets exp eriencing ratings watches as p art o f its Market Co mmentary & Risk Outlo o k (MACRO) Po litical Brieﬁngs. Outlo o ks reﬂect the six-mo nth fo rward-lo o king risk assessment o f Mo rning Co nsult’s analysts, and are assessed as positive, negative or stable with high, medium, or low certainty. 4. Additional Risk Ratings Considerations This sectio n o utlines additio nal risk ratings co nsideratio ns, including temp o ral co ntinuity, retro active data stability, handling o f p o litical transitio ns, tracking dates, and weighting up dates. 4A. Temporal Continuity All co mp o nent data used to p ro duce Mo rning Co nsult’s Glo bal Po litical Risk Ratings is measured co ntinuo usly (i.e. no temp o ral gap s exist in the data series). All survey q uestio ns used to p ro duce the ratings are similarly temp o rally stable (i.e. q uestio n wo rding remains unchanged o ver the full ratings histo ry fo r each rated market). Co mbined, these features yield ratings series that are fully temp o rally co ntinuo us fo r all rated markets. 5 4B. Retroactive Data Stability Mo rning Co nsult o ccasio nally rep ro cesses ratings co mp o nent data in the event o f survey fraud (such as that arising fro m bo t activity), resulting in limited retro active shifts in the data due to the eliminatio n o f fraudulent resp o nses and higher q uality ratings. All co mp o nent data is o therwise fully retro actively stable. Weighting adjustments, when imp lemented, are ap p lied strictly o n a fo rward-lo o king basis, facilitating systematic histo rical analysis by end-users o f the ratings and co mp o nent data. Please co ntact us with any q uestio ns regarding p rio r ep iso des o f data rep ro cessing. Mo rning Co nsult clients are ap p rised o f data rep ro cessing incidents o n an o ngo ing basis. 5 The two so le excep tio ns fo r rated markets are Sp ain (fo r which leader ap p ro val data fo r Pedro Sánchez is unavailable fro m June 18-20, 2022, and the Czech Rep ublic (fo r which leader ap p ro val data fo r Petr Fiala is unavailable fro m March 11-16, 2023). 7 4C. Updates to Leader Approval Tracking Following Political Transitions In the event o f a p o litical transitio n, Mo rning Co nsult generally begins tracking p ublic ap p ro val o f the new chief executive within o ne week o f his/her inauguratio n, at which time tracking o f the p rio r chief executive co ncludes. In the event o f o verlap p ing tracking, risk ratings inco rp o rate ap p ro val o f the new incumbent leader fro m the ﬁrst co mp lete day o f available tracking data; all o verlap p ing days o f data resulting fro m o ngo ing tracking o f the p rio r leader fo llo wing the seating o f the new o ne are remo ved fro m the data p rio r to co nstructing the ratings. Please co ntact us with q uestio ns regarding exact tracking start and end dates fo r chief chief executives in rated markets. 4D. Handling of Intra-Month Political Transitions In cases o f intra-mo nth p o litical transitio ns (i.e. transitio ns that do no t o ccur o n the ﬁrst date o f a given mo nth), Mo rning Co nsult’s “net leader ap p ro val” co mp o nent data p rices in p ublic ap p ro val o f all incumbent leaders in a given mo nth, such that their ap p ro val is treated interchangeably. 4E. Start Dates for Rated Markets Fo r all rated markets fo r which co mp o nent data readings are available p rio r to the 16th day o f the ﬁrst mo nth o f tracking, risk ratings are available beginning in that same mo nth. Fo r rated markets fo r which co mp o nent data readings are available fro m the 16th day o f the ﬁrst mo nth o f tracking o nwards, risk ratings are available beginning in the subseq uent mo nth. This criteria ap p lies so lely to the ﬁrst mo nth in which a rated market has been inco rp o rated in Mo rning Co nsult’s Glo bal Po litical Risk Ratings. See Table A5 fo r a co mp lete listing o f rating start dates by market. 4F. Market-Speciﬁc Weighting Adjustments Mo rning Co nsult p erio dically up dates its survey weights and weighting variables fo r rated markets to better reﬂect the demo grap hic co mp o sitio n o f the target p o p ulatio n. Weighting targets are reviewed annually, with changes to markets with new p o p ulatio n data o ccurring in the ﬁrst week o f each calendar year, alo ngside o ccasio nal intra-year weighting up dates.

Ratings Validation Mo rning Co nsult relies o n externally available data to validate its p o litical risk metrics. At p resent, Mo rning Co nsult has fo cused o n validatio n o n two fro nts: (1) relatio nship s between risk readings and eco no mic p o licy uncertainty, and (2) relatio nship s between risk readings and the likeliho o d o f so cial unrest.

Social Unrest As described in earlier sectio ns, Mo rning Co nsult’s Po litical Risk Ratings are derived fro m two measures o f p ublic satisfactio n with the p o litical status q uo : (1) ap p ro val o f the incumbent chief executive and (2) p ercep tio ns that the co untry in general is headed in the right directio n (o r no t). As such, o ne way to validate o ur risk metric is to evaluate its relatio nship to a p hysical manifestatio n o f p o litical risk o utside o f the regular electio n cycle: p ro tests. To that end, Mo rning Co nsult’s glo bal p o litical analysts have used the underlying risk readings as an inp ut into “Pro test Predicto r” – a p redictive mo del fo r p ro test activity maintained by Mo rning Co nsult. The direct relatio nship between Mo rning Co nsult’s risk readings and p ro test p revalence — which we assess using the Armed Co nﬂict Lo catio n and Event Data (ACLED) — is co mp lex and no n-linear, in keep ing with the literature and as seen in Figure 2 belo w.

Ratings are no tched with p lus and minus sub-ratings (e.g. A+ , A-), referred to as “no tches.” 1. AAA (unno tched) 2. AA (with + /- no tches) 3. A (with + /- no tches) 4. BBB (with + /- no tches) 5. BB (with + /- no tches) 6. B (with + /- no tches) 7. CCC (with + /- no tches) 8. U (unstable) Rating Transition A transitio n fro m o ne rating to ano ther. Ratings Band Aggregate letter ratings bands, which gro up all ratings sharing the same letter co mbinatio n into a single band. Ratings actio n (see belo w) is determined o n the basis o f mo vement acro ss ratings bands. 1. AAA (unno tched) 2. AA (unno tched) 3. A (unno tched) 4. BBB (unno tched) 5. BB (unno tched) 6. B (unno tched) 7. CCC (unno tched) 8. U (unno tched) Ratings Band Transition A transitio n fro m o ne ratings band to ano ther. Ratings Action Indicates whether a market has exp erienced a ratings “up grade” o r “do wngrade.” Markets that do no t exp erience either are assessed as “stable,” reﬂecting a lack o f ratings actio n. 1. Up grade 2. Stable 3. Do wngrade Upgrade A mo nth-o n-mo nth transitio n fro m a lo wer ratings band to a higher ratings band, indicating decreasing risk. Downgrade A mo nth-o n-mo nth transitio n fro m a higher ratings band to a lo wer ratings band, indicating increasing risk. 13 Table A1.2 Ratings Watch Termino lo gy Term Deﬁnition Possible Values Ratings Watch Indicates whether a market has exp erienced an intra-band ratings transitio n, reﬂecting mo vement fro m o ne ratings “no tch” to ano ther within the same letter band (e.g. fro m AA+ to AA, fro m BBB+ to BBB, fro m CCC to CCC-). Markets fo r which Mo rning Co nsult has issued ratings actio n in a given mo nth are no t assigned ratings watches and are assessed as “no t ap p licable.” 1. Up side 2. Do wnside 3. No t Ap p licable (n/a) Upside Ratings Watch “Up side ratings watches” indicate a transitio n fro m a lo wer no tch to a higher no tch within the same band, indicating decreasing risk. Downside Ratings Watch “Do wnside ratings watches” indicate a transitio n fro m a higher no tch to a lo wer no tch within the same band, indicating increasing risk. Discretionary Ratings Watch A ratings watch issued at the discretio n o f Mo rning Co nsult’s p o litical analysts in cases where they assess that a p articular market’s p o litical dynamics are wo rth mo nito ring absent the issuance o f a fo rmal ratings watch. 1. Up side 2. Do wnside 14 Table A1.3 Risk Readings Termino lo gy Term Deﬁnition Possible Values Risk Reading The simp le intra-mo nth average o f (1) net ap p ro val o f the incumbent chief executive and (2) net co untry trajecto ry, deﬁned as the net share o f adults in each market who say their co untry is headed in the right directio n, each measured o n a daily basis. Sp eciﬁcally, to co mp ute the risk ratings, we ﬁrst take the daily average o f the two co mp o nent series, and subseq uently co mp ute the intra-mo nth mean o f the resulting values, yielding a mo nthly “risk reading” ranging fro m -100 to 100. Higher values co rresp o nd to lo wer risk. Ratings assignments (see p receding rubric) are made based o n underlying risk readings ro unded to the nearest who le number. ● -100 to 100 (ro unded to the nearest who le number) Risk Reading Volatility The intra-mo nth standard deviatio n o f daily risk readings fo r a given co untry. Risk Reading Volatility, Monthly Change The mo nth-o n-mo nth diﬀerence in vo latility, co rresp o nding to “increasing,” “stable” (reﬂecting no change), o r “decreasing.” Assessments are made based o n vo latility readings ro unded to the nearest who le number p rio r to taking their diﬀerence. 1. Increasing 2. Stable 3. Decreasing 15 Table A1.4 Risk Trajecto ry & Outlo o k Termino lo gy Term Deﬁnition Possible Values Risk Trajectory Indicates whether a co untry’s underlying risk readings are increasing, stable, o r decreasing mo nth-o n-mo nth, co rresp o nding to a “p o sitive,” “stable” (reﬂecting no change), o r “negative” trajecto ry. A value o f “p ending” indicates that a newly rated market do es no t have suﬃcient temp o ral histo ry to assess its risk trajecto ry. Trajecto ry assessments are made based o n risk readings ro unded to the nearest who le number p rio r to taking their diﬀerence. 1. Po sitive 2. Stable 3. Negative 4. Pending (trajecto ry canno t be assessed due to insuﬃcient temp o ral histo ry) Conﬁdence (“Baseline Conﬁdence”) Reﬂects a statistical co nﬁdence assessment fo r a rated market’s mo nthly risk trajecto ry, derived fro m an indep endent two -samp le diﬀerence-in-means test with uneq ual variances o f risk readings assessed mo nth-o n-mo nth. Rep o rted co nﬁdence metrics reﬂect the statistical signiﬁcance o f the test results. 1. High (p -value < = .05) 2. Medium (p -value > .05 and < = .10) 3. Lo w (p -value > .10) (Assessment thresho lds are inverted fo r markets with stable risk readings, reﬂecting the statistical likeliho o d that no mo nth-o n-mo nth change in risk has o ccurred.)
