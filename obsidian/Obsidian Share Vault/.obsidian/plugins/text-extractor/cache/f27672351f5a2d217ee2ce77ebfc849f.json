The model structure is based on a deep neural network that contains a so-called probability layer. The network’s output is a parametric distribution with 2 (normal) or 4 (Johnson’s SU) parameters. In a forecasting study involving day-ahead electricity prices in the German market, our approach signiﬁcantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, including LASSO-estimated regressions and deep neural networks combined with Quantile Regression Averaging. The obtained results not only emphasize the importance of higher moments when modeling volatile electricity prices, but also – given that probabilistic forecasting is the essence of risk management – provide important implications for managing portfolios in the power sector.

Introduction and motivation Trading in competitive markets requires precise prob- abilistic forecasts. Therefore, the attention of researchers and practitioners is shifting recently from point to prob- abilistic forecasting methods. It is not diﬀerent in elec- tricity markets since the liberalization starting in 1990s. The point electricity price forecasting (EPF) literature is very broad, and the topic is well-researched (Weron, 2014). However, these models can be used in probabilistic fore- casting only to a limited extent, as they mostly predict only the expected price, rarely quantiles or other charac- teristics. A proper risk optimization that is compulsory in the very volatile and uncertain electricity markets can only be carried out using methods that provide a broader view, such as e.g. distributional forecasting. It did not go unnoticed to researchers (Nowotarski and Weron, 2018; Petropoulos et al., 2022), however the literature on prob- abilistic EPF is much scarcer than the one on point EPF. We propose a probabilistic EPF approach based on dis- tributional neural networks. More speciﬁcally, we consider a ‘vanilla’ deep neural network (DNN), i.e., a multi-layer perceptron in which the information propagates only for- ward. We utilize the TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015) and Keras (Chollet et al., 2015) frameworks, and let the out- put layer be a parametric distribution with 2 or 4 pa- rameters (Barnes and Barnes, 2021; Barnes et al., 2021; Salinas et al., 2020). The diﬀerence to a standard net- work providing point forecasts is only in the output layer. Thus, if we have already built a neural network model for point forecasting, it is very easy to convert it to a distribu- tional one. Even though the method is not new (Nix and Weigend, 1994; Williams, 1996), it has not attracted much attention. To the best of our knowledge, the only exist- ing distributional networks in the energy forecasting liter- ature use mixtures of normal distributions obtained using complex structures comprising convolutional neural net- works (CNN) and gated recurrent units (GRU) (Afrasiabi et al., 2020) or recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Brusa- ferri et al., 2020; Mashlakov et al., 2021). The distribu- tional deep neural network (DDNN) proposed in this pa- per is far less complex than the CNNs, GRUs and RNNs, easier to interpret and computationally less demanding. Neural network-based models are popular and have been shown to achieve good predictive accuracy in the ﬁelds of point EPF (Keles et al., 2016; Lago et al., 2021), load forecasting – both point (Yang et al., 2019) and quan- tile (Zhou et al., 2022) as well as quantile wind power forecasting (He and Zhang, 2020). However, despite the relative simplicity of moving from point to probabilistic forecasting using the TensorFlow framework, it has not been utilized in EPF yet. The performance of the model is evaluated using a rolling window forecasting study with the day-ahead elec- tricity prices in Germany. The DDNN is benchmarked against naive bootstrapping and two well performing point EPF approaches (Lago et al., 2021): a lasso estimated autoregression (LEAR) and a DNN, both combined with quantile regression averaging (QRA) for converting point predictions into probabilistic ones. The major contributions of the manuscript are as fol- lows: 1. It is the ﬁrst work to consider the DDNN and one of the ﬁrst to consider probabilistic neural networks in electricity price forecasting. Preprint submitted to Elsevier December 13, 2022arXiv:2207.02832v2 [q-fin.ST] 10 Dec 2022 2. The proposed method is very simple compared to the existing neural network solutions. As we show in this paper, the generalization from a point to a distributional DNN requires almost no eﬀort. 3. If needed, point forecasts can be easily derived from the predicted distribution. 4. It is the ﬁrst in EPF and one of the ﬁrst studies to use the Johnson’s SU (Johnson, 1949) distribution in probabilistic forecasting (Mori, 2021). 5. It is a fully automatic forecasting method that may be used with other markets and data. The code is open-source. 6. The obtained forecasts are interpretable in terms of distribution’s characteristics, and the results provide evidence of the importance of higher moments in EPF. 7. The aggregation schemes for probabilistic forecasts proposed in the paper yield robust predictions that signiﬁcantly outperform the state-of-the-art bench- marks in terms of the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). Finally, given that probabilistic forecasting is the essence of risk management, our study provides power market par- ticipants with a new, signiﬁcantly more accurate tool for assessing risks related to trading power portfolios. The remainder of this manuscript is structured as fol- lows. Section 2 introduces the reader to the concept of dis- tributional artiﬁcial neural networks. Section 3 provides an overview of the market and data used in the appli- cation study. The models, including the DDNN and the hyperparameter tuning, are described in Section 4. The application study together with the results are presented in Section 5. The paper is concluded with a discussion of the main ﬁndings in Section 6. 1.1. Probabilistic forecasting literature The probabilistic EPF literature is not as rich as the one considering point forecasts, what can be deducted from the reviews of Nowotarski and Weron (2018), Ziel and Steinert (2018) and Hong et al. (2020). Researchers consider mainly the day-ahead market, which is the main electricity spot trading place. However in recent years the research focused on other markets as well, e.g. the intraday (Janke and Steinke, 2019; Narajewski and Ziel, 2020a,b; Oksuz and Ugurlu, 2019; Uniejewski et al., 2019) and bal- ancing markets (Browell and Gilbert, 2022; Janczura and Wójcik, 2022; Kraft et al., 2020). Two widely used and eﬃcient model estimation methods in point EPF are lasso (Narajewski and Ziel, 2020a; Uniejewski et al., 2019; Ziel, 2016; Ziel and Weron, 2018) of Tibshirani (1996) and arti- ﬁcial neural networks (Dudek, 2016; Lago et al., 2021; Luo and Weng, 2019; Oksuz and Ugurlu, 2019; Zahid et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). A substantial stream of new EPF research considers hybrid models (Jahangir et al., 2019; Olivares et al., 2022; Oreshkin et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), however, as Lago et al. (2021) conclude, they of- ten avoid proper comparisons to well-established methods. The probabilistic EPF comprises mostly of quantile regres- sion (Maciejowska, 2020; Maciejowska et al., 2016; Marc- jasz et al., 2020a), bootstrapping (Efron, 1979) of point forecast residuals (Narajewski and Ziel, 2022; Wan et al., 2013; Ziel and Steinert, 2018), and of RNNs (Brusaferri et al., 2020; Mashlakov et al., 2021). We follow the recom- mendations of Lago et al. (2021) and compare our model against the very competitive lasso estimated autoregres- sive (LEAR) and a point deep neural network. These are point forecasting models, thus we apply quantile regression averaging on them. Other methods of obtaining proba- bilistic forecasts, such as bootstrap, could be considered as well, but we refrain from that for the sake of simplicity. A vast amount of literature concerns also forecast com- binations in the electricity markets (Hubicka et al., 2018; Karabiber and Xydis, 2019; Seraﬁn et al., 2019), however due to the complexity of the probabilistic forecast aggre- gation as pointed out by Berrisch and Ziel (2022), we limit ourselves only to two simple averaging schemes with equal weights that allow to stabilize the neural network predic- tions. 2. The distributional deep neural network (DDNN) model We assume that the reader is familiar with and un- derstands the concept of the (feed-forward) deep neural networks (DNN). In this section, we brieﬂy recall the def- inition and the mathematics behind it to underline the diﬀerence between the DNN with point and probabilistic output layers. 2.1. Architecture Let X ∈ RD×N be the input matrix with N denoting the number of features and D the number of observations. Further, let Hi ∈ RD×hi be the output matrix of ith hid- den layer, Wi ∈ Rhi−1×hi and bi ∈ RD×h1 be the corre- sponding hidden-layer weights and bias where hi ∈ N is the number of neurons in ith hidden layer with h0 = N and thus H0 = X. Additionally, denote ai(·) the ith acti- vation function. Then, for i ∈ {1, . . . , I} we have Hi = ai (Hi−1Wi + bi) . (1) Now, we got to the point where the DNN with point and probabilistic output layers diﬀer. That is to say, in the standard DNN we calculate the output O ∈ RD×S, where S is the number of modelled features. Formally, O = HI WI+1 + bI+1 (2) are the values returned by the network. Such DNN is optimized given the true observation matrix Y ∈ RD×S 2 with respect to point losses, e.g. the mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE). In the case of the DDNN, the parameter layer Θ ∈ RD×S·P consists of P distribution parameters for each of the S modelled fea- tures. It is however computed in the same manner as in equation (2). The ﬁnal output is made by creating a D×S- dimensional matrix of the assumed distributions F (Θ; x). The network is then optimized given the true observation matrix Y ∈ RD×S with respect to probabilistic losses, e.g. by maximizing the likelihood for a parametric distribution or by minimizing the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). Figure 1 provides an example with I = 2 hidden layers and this setting we use in the remainder of the manuscript. The number of neurons in the hidden layers is arbitrary, but the same for both DNNs in order to underline the dif- ference between the point and probabilistic networks. We see clearly that the input and hidden layers are identical for both DNNs and only the output part diﬀers. As a ﬁnal remark of the subsection, we discuss the mul- tivariate output which consists of multiple features and the possible probabilistic distributions. Namely, we allow in the deﬁnition for S output features, and in our setting they are all S = 24 hours of the electricity prices of the following day. This can be done as all the day-ahead elec- tricity prices are published at once, and therefore they can share the input regressor set. In other applications this is rather not the case, however such a multivariate setting may still be preserved if one considers S similar time series to be forecasted that may beneﬁt from common regressors. The probabilistic output layer may consist of nearly any implemented probabilistic distribution. Based on ap- plication, these can be, e.g., binomial or Poisson if we deal with a discrete problem, gamma or beta if we deal with a continuous problem, but supported only on the positive line, or normal, t or Johnson’s SU if supported on the whole real line. As the electricity prices may be both pos- itive and negative, we use in our study the two-parametric normal and four-parametric Johnson’s SU distributions. 2.2. Regularization The danger of overﬁtting the model can be tackled in the DDNN similarly as in the standard one. One could use regularization, a dropout layer or early stopping. We use all of these in our forecasting study, however we approach the regularization of the parameter layer diﬀerently. The DNN design allows for Lp regularization of every hidden layer Hi, its weights Wi, and bias bi. Applying it to the DNN we get the following loss with regularization Lreg(Y , O) = L(Y , O) + I∑ i=0 λ1,i||Hi||p+ + I∑ i=0 λ2,i||Wi+1||p + I∑ i=0 λ3,i||bi+1||p (3) where || · ||p represents the Lp norm. One can ﬂexibly choose between the types of regularization, use both or none, and choose to regularize only some part of the net- work, e.g., only H1 layer and W2 weights. The λj,i pa- rameters are subject to hyperparameter tuning. The reg- ularization of the DDNN may be done in the same way as described in Eq. (3), however, we could also regularize each of the distributional parameters separately as follows Lreg (Y , F (Θ; x)) = L(Y , F (Θ; x)) + I−1∑ i=0 λ1,i||Hi||k+ + I−1∑ i=0 λ2,i||Wi+1||k + I−1∑ i=0 λ3,i||bi+1||k+ + P∑ p=1 (λ1,I,p||HI ||k + λ2,I,p||WI+1||k + λ3,I,p||bI+1||k) . (4) The diﬀerence between Eq. (4) and Eq. (3) is the regular- ization of the last layer. Namely, in Eq. (3) we regularize the whole output layer using the same λj,I values, whereas in Eq. (4) each parameter p ∈ {1, . . . , P } is regularized us- ing its own λj,I,p values. The colour arrows in Figure 1(b) denote separate kernel WI+1 regularization for each of the distributions’ parameters. The reason to use such a dif- ferentiation is the possibility to use diﬀerent amount of inputs’ information for each distribution parameter, what was already observed in the literature (Narajewski and Ziel, 2020b). 3. The data The goal in the empirical case study is forecasting day- ahead electricity prices in Germany. This section famil- iarizes the reader with the utilized data, especially the in- put features and the forecasting objective. The electricity markets in Europe consist of derivative, spot and balanc- ing parts (Viehmann, 2017). The most important is the spot market, particularly the day-ahead auction. It takes place once a day at noon where all S products of the fol- lowing day are traded in a uniform price auction (Weron and Ziel, 2019). In the majority of countries S = 24, how- ever in some cases like the UK it is S = 48. As all hours of the following day are traded at once, all of them are based on the same set of information. Therefore, in our study we model all the prices using exactly the same in- put features, what supports the multivariate output of the DDNN presented in Section 2. The considered dataset spans six years of hourly obser- vations from 01.01.2015 to 31.12.2020. The study uses a rolling window what mimics the daily business in practice and is a standard procedure in the EPF literature (Weron, 2014; Weron and Ziel, 2019). The initial in-sample pe- riod spans the date range from 01.01.2015 to 26.12.2018 which consists of D = 4 · 364 = 1456 observations. For the purpose of hyperparameter tuning, we split it additionally 3 X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 . . .

The out-of-sample period starts on 27.12.2018, and ends on 31.12.2020, however the ﬁrst 182 observations are used to obtain the QRA fore- casts and thus are excluded from the analysis. Therefore, the ﬁnal out-of-sample test set for probabilistic predictions uses 554 days of data. The models are retrained every day using the most recent D observations and the hyperparam- eters obtained in the tuning that is run on initial in-sample dataset. Figure 2 shows plots of the considered features together with the dates and study stages mentioned above. The data contains the day-ahead (DA) electricity prices, DA load forecasts, DA renewable energy sources (RES) fore- casts, EU emission allowance prices and fuel: coal, oil and natural gas prices. The RES forecast is a sum of wind oﬀ- shore, wind onshore and solar generation day-ahead fore- casts. The DA prices and load forecasts exhibit strong daily, weekly and annual seasonality. Thus, we model each hour of the day separately within a single neural network and also utilize the weekday dummies. We do not con- struct any regressor explaining the annual behavior as it is well described by the load data. On the other hand, the RES forecasts exhibit only daily and annual season- ality and the EUA and fuel prices are random-walk type processes. These conclusions might not be easy to derive based on Figure 2, however see Ziel and Weron (2018), Sgarlato and Ziel (2022) and Billé et al. (2022) for more insights. Figure 3 presents histograms of prices for selected hours. Additionally, we ﬁt there normal and Johnson’s SU dis- tributions and plot their densities. Both distributions be- long to the location-scale family. The normal distribution N (µ, σ2) is a well-known two-parametric distribution with µ being the location and σ the scale parameters. The John- son’s SU distribution J (µ, σ, ν, τ ) was ﬁrst investigated by Johnson (1949) as a transformation of the normal distribu- 4 100 0 100 200DA Price(EUR/MWh) Training Validation QRA calibration Out-of-sample testing Hyper-parameter tuning 40 60DA LoadForecast(GWh) 0 20 40 60DA RESForecast(GWh) 10 20 30EUA Price(EUR/tCO2) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Time 0 50 100Fuel prices API2 Coal Price (EUR/t) Brent Oil Price (EUR/bbl.)

It is a four-parametric distribution with µ being the location, σ the scale, ν the skewness and τ the tail-weight parameters. So far, it has not found application with dis- tributional neural networks. However, it is often used in the context of energy commodities (Abramova and Bunn, 2020; Gianfreda and Bunn, 2018; Patra, 2021). Based on Figure 3 we suspect that the Johnson’s SU is more suitable for modeling the electricity prices than the normal. We ob- serve heavy tails and skewness what cannot be explained by the normal distribution. Thus, in the forecasting study we use both distributions to emphasize the gain that comes from using the more ﬂexible distribution. 4. Models and estimation 4.1. Input features Let us recall that we forecast the S = 24 day-ahead prices on day T , i.e. YT = (YT,1, YT,2, . . . , YT,S) ′. The fol- lowing input features are available for all considered mod- els: • Past day-ahead prices of the previous three days and one week ago, i.e. YT −1, YT −2, YT −3, and YT −7. • Day-ahead forecasts of the total load for day T , i.e. X L T = (X L T,1, X L T,2, . . . , X L T,S)′, as well as the past values of the previous day and one week ago, i.e. X L T −1, and X L T −7. • Day-ahead forecasts of renewable energy sources (RES) for day T , i.e. X RES T = (X RES T,1 , X RES T,2 , . . . , X RES T,S ) ′, as well as the past values of the previous day, i.e. X RES T −1 . • EU emission allowance most recent closing price, i.e. X EU A T −2 . • Fuels most recent closing prices, i.e. X Coal T −2 , X Gas T −2, and X Oil T −2. • Weekday dummies, i.e. DoWd(T ) for d = 1, 2, . . . , 7. Let us note that the forecasting exercise is performed on day T − 1 before the day-ahead auction. That is to say, we possess only the information available at around 11:30 CET on day T − 1. The considered input does not violate this assumption, and therefore we use e.g. T − 2 lag for the EUA and fuels prices. 4.2. Probabilistic neural network The probabilistic NN model uses the DDNN described in Section 2. The model consists of 2 hidden layers, S out- put distributions, and various number of input features. The output distributions are assumed to be either nor- mal or Johnson’s SU and each of them deﬁnes a separate model. We regularize the model through input feature se- lection, dropout layer and L1 regularization of the hidden layers and weights. All these are subject to hyperparame- ter tuning. Additionally, we tune the activation functions, the number of neurons, and the learning rate. The de- tailed list of hyperparameters and the process is described in Section 4.2.1. The model is built and estimated using the TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015) and Keras (Chollet et al., 2015) frame- works. The hyperparameter optimization is performed with the help of Optuna (Akiba et al., 2019) package, 4 times for result stability reasons, each time consisting of 2048 iterations. We report the results for each of the 4 optimized hyperparameter sets, as well as for 3 diﬀerent ensembles of the four distributions, as described in Section 5. The model consists naturally also of components that are not tuned in the hyperparameter optimization. That is to say, the model uses additionally an input normalization, negative loglikehood as the loss function, Adam optimizing algorithm, and early stopping callback with patience of 50 epochs. The batch size is ﬁxed to 32, and the maximum number of epochs to 1500. For the rolling prediction, the dataframe was shuﬄed and 20% was left out for validation. Probabilistic neural networks are denoted in the later parts of the paper using DDNN-{distribution}-{run} scheme, where {distribution} is either Normal (or N) or JSU and {run} is either a number from 1 to 4 (cor- responding to the individual hyperparameter sets), or an indicator of the ensemble of the four: pEns for the vertical average or qEns for the horizontal averaging. See Section 4.2.1 for the description of diﬀerent schemes. Note, that when the choice of the distribution is obvious, as in Fig. 5, the {distribution} term may be missing in the model acronym. 4.2.1. Hyperparameter tuning for neural network models The neural network models (both point and distribu- tional) underwent the hyperparameter optimization con- sidering below hyperparameters and their potential values: • Indicator for inclusion of input features described in Section 4.1 (14 hyperparameters). • Dropout layer – whether to use the dropout layer af- ter the input layer, and if yes at what rate. The rate parameter is drawn from (0, 1) interval (up to 2 hy- perparameters – the rate is not optimized if dropout layer is not present in the model). • Number of neurons in the hidden layers. The values are chosen from integers from [16, 1024] interval (1 hyperparameter per layer). • Activation functions used in each of the hidden lay- ers. The possible functions are: elu, relu, sigmoid, softmax, softplus, and tanh (1 hyperparameter per layer). • L1 regularization for hidden layers – whether to use the L1 regularization on the hidden layers and their weights and if yes at what rate. The rate is drawn from (10 −5, 10) interval on a log-scale (up to 2 hyper- parameters per layer – inclusion of L1 for the layer and the rate). 6 • L1 regularization for distribution layer – separate for each of the P distribution parameters, where P = 2 for normal and P = 4 for Johnson’s SU distributions – whether to use the L1 regularization and if yes at what rate (a total of 2P hyperparameters; rates identical to the hidden layer regularization). • Learning rate for the Adam algorithm chosen from the (10 −5, 10−1) interval on a log-scale (1 hyperpa- rameter). The process consists of 2048 iterations of the optimiza- tion algorithm which are performed in a hybrid batch- rolling approach. Having the ﬁrst four years (1456 days) at disposal, we split them into training data (the ﬁrst 1092 days) and validation data (the last 364 days). Note, that the ﬁrst day of the out-of-sample test window is the day after the end of the hyperparameter validation data, as illustrated on Figure 2 (i.e., there is no data contamina- tion). The hybrid approach is needed to balance two op- posing factors. On one hand, a batch estimation (using a single estimation on NN weights) would be less computa- tionally demanding (we would only have 1 neural network trained for every considered hyperparameter set), however the results of such an experiment are very volatile. The best hyperparameter set chosen using the accuracy metric of only a single run would not – in general – guarantee a good predictive performance. On the other hand, a rolling setting identical to the one used later (i.e., with a daily recalibration) would be infeasible to compute (as it would take roughly 364 times longer than for batch approach – we would have 364 neural networks trained for every hyper- parameter set). The hybrid approach we have chosen uses 13 recalibrations of neural network models with batches of 28 days estimated using each of the nets. Training data is rolled by 28 days after each step. As mentioned earlier, to counteract the local behavior of the hyperparameter optimizer, we repeat the process four times for each of the neural networks. We observe that the predictive performance across the separate hy- perparameter sets is not consistent, however the simple aggregation schemes described below provide results con- sistently better than any of the inputs. The ﬁrst of the aggregation schemes is a mixture distri- bution, which corresponds to averaging the distributions vertically. However, having two distributions with disjoint pdfs (e.g., two copies of the same distributions signiﬁcantly shifted), the resulting mixture will be very wide, and might have a “gap” in the middle. A more robust alternative is considered, which utilizes horizontal (quantile) averaging – i.e., a quantile of an ensemble is computed as an arith- metic mean of the same quantiles from all distributions considered. Such an aggregation in an edge case described earlier would result in an unimodal ensemble distribution, which is much sharper than the vertically averaged one. 4.3. Benchmarks 4.3.1. The naive model The ﬁrst and the simplest benchmark model that we consider is the well-known and widely utilized (Weron, 2014; Ziel and Weron, 2018) naive model. It requires no parameter tuning. Its formula is as follows E (YT ) = { YT −7, DoWd(T ) = 1 for d = 1, 6, 7, YT −1, otherwise. (5) In other words, the naive model uses the prices of yester- day to forecast the prices on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs- day and Friday, and the last week’s prices on Monday, Sat- urday and Sunday. The price distributions are obtained using the bootstrap method which was ﬁrst proposed by Efron (1979). We receive the distributions by adding the in-sample bootstrapped errors to the forecasted expected price ̂Y m T = ̂E (YT ) + ̂ε m T for m = 1, . . . , M (6) where ̂ε m T are drawn with replacement in-sample residuals for day T , i.e., we sample from the set of ̂εd = Yd − ̂Yd for d = 1, . . . , D. 4.3.2. The LEAR model combined with QRA The ﬁrst of the models that use the structure presented in Section 4.1 is LEAR point forecasting model that uses Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) to generate prob- abilistic forecasts. The LEAR model utilizes the LASSO regularization (Tibshirani, 1996). Such an approach elim- inates the need for an additional input selection, as the al- gorithm itself indirectly chooses the most relevant inputs. The regularization parameter (the sole hyperparameter of the LEAR model) is obtained using 7-fold cross validation and a grid of 100 values automatically chosen by a least angle regression (LARS) based estimator. The LEAR ap- proach encompasses a forecast averaging scheme proposed by Lago et al. (2021) – four independent forecasts are gen- erated for each hour (based on 56, 84, 1092 and 1456 day rolling calibration windows) and the ﬁnal output is their simple average. Such an approach allows for a balance of the ability to adapt to rapidly-changing market conditions (thanks to the shorter calibration windows) with robust- ness coming from the use of long windows. It was shown to provide forecasts that – on average – are on par or better than all of the comprising forecasts considered separately (Lago et al., 2021). There are two ways of using a set of four separate fore- casts or an ensemble: one that uses the whole information directly (i.e., the separate forecasts), which we will denote QRA (Quantile Regression Averaging) and QRM (Quan- tile Regression committee Machine) that uses the ensemble of the point predictions (Marcjasz et al., 2020b). Aside from the input data, the QRA and QRM ap- proaches are identical – both use quantile regression with 7 182 day rolling calibration window to produce the fore- cast for each of the 99 percentiles, which approximate the predictive distribution relatively well. The LEAR models’ results are denoted by LEAR- {CAL} for the point forecast estimated using {CAL} calibration days (e.g., LEAR-1456 for the longest cali- bration window), LEAR-Ens for an hour-by-hour aver- age of all 4 point forecasts and LEAR-QRA and -QRM for the probabilistic forecasts. 4.3.3. The DNN model combined with QRA The second set of benchmarks utilizes a point neural network model. It diﬀers from the probabilistic counter- part only in the output construction in the network and hyperparameters corresponding to the missing distribution layer (see Sections 2, 4.2 and Figure 1). The rest of the model setting remains unchanged: DNN model has the same inputs, the same hyperparameter selection and uses the same calibration window lengths and training and val- idation splits. The loss function for the network is MAE, whereas DDNN uses log-likelihood. Similarly to the DDNN, for the (point) DNN we also derive four independently-trained hyperparameter sets. This allows us to i) measure the robustness of the predictions and ii) apply two quantile-regression based methods (QRA and QRM), similarly as for the LEAR point predictions, also using a 182 day rolling calibration window. The results are marked with DNN-n for the point forecasts (where n = 1, . . . , 4 or Ens) and DNN-QRA and DNN-QRM, respectively for percentile forecasts ob- tained using quantile regression on the four separate point forecasts and their ensemble. 5. Empirical results Many earlier works show that forecast averaging is of- ten key to achieving accurate predictions. Here, we also aggregate multiple forecast runs to improve the result ac- curacy and robustness. However, considering probabilistic forecasts instead of the point ones signiﬁcantly increases the complexity of the aggregation schemes that can be ap- plied. As the detailed discussion is out of scope of this paper, we opted to include only the simple aggregations, based on the equally-weighted averaging or distribution mixing. On the probabilistic forecasts side, we have four hy- perparameter sets chosen in four separate hyperparameter optimization runs for both the normal and JSU DDNNs. We report the errors of each of them separately, as well as the result of two aggregation schemes: an equally-weighted mixture of the four resulting distributions (vertical aggre- gation) or a mean of values for a given quantile (horizontal aggregation). 5.1. Evaluation While the paper focuses on probabilistic forecasting, we are also interested in the accuracy of the point fore- casts. The latter can be easily derived from the proba- bilistic ones. Following the best practices of Weron and Ziel (2019), we report two point-oriented metrics: the mean absolute error(MAE; we use median statistic from the probabilistic methodologies for this metric) and root mean squared error (RMSE; we use mean statistic). When it comes to the probabilistic forecasts, we use the CRPS, or rather its approximation – an average pinball score across 99 percentiles.(Gneiting, 2011; Hong et al., 2016): Pinball( ˆQYt(q), Yt, q) = =    (1 − q) ( ˆQYt(q) − Yt) forYt < ˆQYt(q), q (Yt − ˆQYt(q) ) forYt ≥ ˆQYt (q), (7) where ˆQYt(q) is the forecast of the q-th quantile of the price Yt. Additionally for each hour of the day, we perform the Kupiec test (Kupiec, 1995) for unconditional coverage for 50% and 90% prediction intervals (PIs). For the CRPS, we aggregate the score across all forecasted hours, whereas for the Kupiec test, we provide the number of hours which passed the Kupiec test. Lastly, we use the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test that measures the statistical signiﬁcance of the diﬀerence be- tween the accuracy of the forecasts of two models (here, we use A and B to discern between them) (Muniain and Ziel, 2020; Sgarlato and Ziel, 2022; Uniejewski et al., 2019). Let us denote the vector of errors (here, the CRPS scores) of model Z for day d as L d Z. Then, the multivariate loss diﬀerential series ∆d A,B = ||L d A||1 − ||L d B||1 (8) deﬁnes the diﬀerence of the L1 norm of loss vectors. For each pair of models, we compute the p-value of two one- sided DM tests – one with the null hypothesis H0 : E(∆ d A,B) ≤ 0, which corresponds to the outperformance of model B forecasts by those of model A and the second with the re- verse null hypothesis H0 : E(∆d A,B) ≥ 0, complementary to the ﬁrst one. We use the CRPS as the loss function. 5.2. Results In terms of the CRPS scores, as can be seen in Figure 5 and Table 1, the LEAR-based methods are signiﬁcantly worse than the neural network-based approaches. How- ever, the performance of the latter is not robust – run- to-run, the CRPS scores diﬀer by as much as 10%. As discussed in Section 5.3, this is not known ex-ante, there- fore an aggregation scheme is needed. After ensembling, regardless of the aggregation scheme applied (vertical, hor- izontal with mean, horizontal with median), we see simi- lar performance. The normally-distributed networks yield a CRPS of ca. 1.35, whereas JSU ones – 1.30, i.e., ca. 3-4% better than the normal.

As shown in Table 1, the neural network-based models are better than LEAR-based ones also for the point fore- casts. Interestingly, the ensemble of DNN forecasts has the third lowest error – both in terms of MAE and RMSE. The best model according to MAE is DDNN-JSU-pEns, followed by its -qEns counterpart – the two models with the best CRPS score. However, these models are worse w.r.t. the RMSE than all other NN-based models. On the other hand, we see the lowest RMSE for DNN-QR based methods, closesly followed by the DNN-Ens model. The DDNNs are ca 2% (normal) and 7% (JSU) worse. There are only minor diﬀerences between the vertical and hori- zontal aggregation schemes. Additionally, we performed the Kupiec test for uncon- ditional coverage with 5% signiﬁcance level for 50% and 90% prediction intervals. From what can be seen in Table 1, QRA seems to perform better than QRM – for both the LEAR and point DNN models. However, the QR-based approahces pass the Kupiec test for at most 10 hours of the day. The probabilistic DDNNs, on the other hand show mixed performance. The p-Ens forecasts are worse than most other methods, while q-Ens are better than QR- based predictions. As the p-Ens models sport the CRPS scores similar to the q-Ens ones, the latter are a much better choice, especially when chosen with a more robust median quantile instead of mean. Note, however, that the worst overall method (Naive benchmark) provides the best coverage for both 50 and 90% PIs. Lastly, the results of the DM test are visualized in Figure 6. We can observe that DDNN-JSU-qEns is the best model overall, with forecasts signiﬁcantly better than from any other model (represented by a column with all cells green or yellow). Secondly, the DDNN-N-qEns is also signiﬁcantly better than both other aggregation schemes. Lastly, QRA models (both LEAR and DNN ones) pro- duce signiﬁcantly better forecasts than their QRM coun- terparts. 5.3. The need for multiple hyperparameter sets Even though the hyperparameter optimization uses a repeated neural network training procedure to mimic the rolling calibration window setting used later for the evalu- ation, the optimal sets obtained using independent hyper- parameter trials diﬀer signiﬁcantly. Moreover, all the opti- mal sets have a similar, i.e. within 2% diﬀerence, in-sample error metric – what is not reﬂected in the out-of-sample er- ror obtained using this set. Here, the diﬀerences are much more prominent, up to 10%. The locality of the hyperpa- rameter optimization is clearly visible in the optimal sets chosen in independent trials, despite most of the trials be- ing stalled after around 1000 iterations. Figure 7 shows choice frequency of the considered input features (i.e., the number of hyperparameter sets that uses a particular in- put variable), described in Section 4.1.

The plots present p-values for the CRPS loss — the closer they are to zero (→ dark green), the more signiﬁcant the diﬀerence is between forecasts of X-axis model (better) and forecasts of the Y-axis model (worse). neural network models are quite consistent when selecting the inputs. The most important ones are the prices of the previous day and two days ago, the current DA forecasts of load and RES, the previous day’s DA forecasts of RES and the recent gas price. The least important are the further lags of prices and load forecast. Besides the diﬀerences in the inputs chosen, hidden layer sizes are the most prominent, especially for the prob- abilistic networks. They found optima in both the larger and smaller networks, as shown in Table 2. For exam- ple, one of the probabilistic neural networks that used the JSU distribution uses 565 and 962 neurons in the hidden layers (amounting to over 540,000 weights just between the two hidden layers), whereas other had 940 and 58 (over 54,000 weights) or 123 and 668 (over 82,000 weights). Moreover, even the activation functions chosen were not unanimous, but softplus seems to be the best for the ﬁrst hidden layer. We also observe that the dropout is almost never chosen, similarly to the regularization of the network weights. To conclude, we observe that there is a need for re- peating the hyperparameter optimization process. Despite the robust optimization setting, the end results are vastly diﬀerent – both in terms of the parameters chosen, and the out-of-sample error metrics. A form of the forecast combination is crucial for the outperformance of QR-based methods. 6. Conclusions The paper proposes an application of distributional neural networks to probabilistic day-ahead electricity price forecasting and a simple, yet well-performing aggregation scheme for the distributional neural networks that stabi- lizes the predictions. Since probabilistic forecasting is the essence of risk management – Value-at-Risk (VaR) is noth- ing else but a quantile forecast – our study provides im- portant implications for managing portfolios in the power sector. Comparing the results with the literature approaches, we observe a strong performance of the neural networks – both the probabilistic forecasts from the proposed methods and from quantile regression applied to their point counter- parts are signiﬁcantly more accurate than the statistical- based combination of LEAR and quantile regression. The added complexity of the neural network having to model the distribution of the data, rather than just their expected values, proves eﬀective, especially when the limitations in- curred by the distribution choice are not too severe. Interestingly, the beneﬁt of using distributional neural networks is visible also when mean absolute errors of the median (50th percentile) forecasts are considered. The DDNN-JSU-Ens approach is the only one that outper- forms the ensemble of point NNs in this regard.
