{"path":"lit/lit_sources/Wong24harrisQuietStudentLoans.pdf","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — At a campaign rally in April, President Joe Biden told a Wisconsin crowd about hislatest “life-changing” plan for student loan cancellation, promising ﬁnancial relief for more than 30 millionAmericans.But Kamala Harris has steered clear of the issue at her political events since replacing Biden as theDemocratic nominee for president. The vice president’s platform mentions it just twice, and with no speciﬁcplan. As she courts moderate voters, Harris has focused on policies targeting Americans without a collegedegree.“For far too long, our nation has encouraged only one path to success: a four-year college degree,” Harris saidin September in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. “Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths.”In the span of just a few years, student loan cancellation has gone from a pillar of the Democratic Party to apolitical liability. Once seen as a sure-ﬁre way to energize young voters, the issue has now become a bludgeonwielded by Republicans who say it heaps advantage on elites and comes at the expense of those who repaidtheir loans or did not attend college.The issue came up just once in the September presidential debate, when Republican Donald Trumphammered Harris and Biden for failing to deliver their promise of widespread cancellation. The formerpresident called it a “total catastrophe” that “taunted young people.”“They didn’t even come close to getting student loans,” Trump said.Biden’s student loan forgiveness efforts have faced relentlessroadblocksBiden, who once questioned the legality of mass student loan forgiveness, campaigned on the issue afterprogressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., made it a mainstream idea. But as president, Biden has facedrelentless challenges from Republican opponents. For the roughly 42 million people with federal studentloans, hope of having them forgiven has turned into resignation and disillusionment.Harris stays quiet on student loans as cancellation loses its political lusterBY  COLLIN BINKLEY AND ALIA WONGUpdated 5:32 AM PST, October 27, 2024 12/16/24, 5:19 PM Harris stays quiet on student loans as cancellation loses its political luster | AP News chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 1/3Biden’s ﬁrst plan to cancel up to $20,000 for millions of people was blocked by the Supreme Court last year. Asecond, narrower plan has been halted by a federal judge after Republican-led states sued. A separate policyintended to lower loan payments for struggling borrowers has been paused by a judge, also after Republican-controlled states challenged it.On Friday, the Biden administration moved ahead with yet another attempt at student loan cancellation, thisone focused on Americans who face heavy ﬁnancial burdens beyond their student loans. It faces an uncertainfuture, arriving less than two weeks before the Nov. 5 election.The legal uncertainty has probably contributed to Harris’ de-emphasis of cancellation, said Michelle Dimino,education program director at the centrist think tank Third Way. It’s also an issue her base is familiar with,she added.“There’s not too much new she can offer before we know what will happen in the courts,” Dimino said. WhenBiden ﬁrst pitched broad cancellation, it was something that hadn’t been tried. ”Now, it’s a totally differentlandscape than it was in 2020, when it was a clean slate.”Harris’ silence also signals the political risks, especially in a tight election. Any new promise of loancancellation would energize Republicans who have made it a rallying cry. For voters who could beneﬁt fromcancellation, it’s a promise they have heard before.“The Harris campaign has realized this is not necessarily a winning political issue,” said Preston Cooper, asenior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.“The student loan agenda is in tatters and hasn’t really helped them win any votes,” Cooper said.Even moderate Americans appear skeptical of student loan forgiveness. A June poll from the University ofChicago Harris School of Public Policy and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Researchfound that 3 in 10 U.S. adults said they approve of Biden’s work on student debt, and it wasn’t much betteramong those repaying loans. Slightly more than half of Democrats said they supported the president’s work,while 18% of independents said the same.Both Harris and Trump promote alternatives to collegeThe Harris campaign declined to give speciﬁcs or answer questions about her cancellation plan.Her platform mentions student loans only after a full page of policies targeting workers without degrees. Atthe September rally in Pennsylvania, Harris drew applause when she said she would get rid of unnecessarydegree requirements for federal jobs. She did not mention student loans in her 20-minute speech.“Requiring a certain degree does not necessarily talk about one’s skills,” Harris told the audience at WilkesUniversity, a private college in northeast Pennsylvania.Harris’ comments echo a traditional Republican talking point that has increasingly been embraced byDemocrats as more Americans question the value of a college degree.“Student loan forgiveness is ... maybe alienating some of the support that Harris is hoping to get from thenon-college-educated,” said Andrew Gillen, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute’s Center forEducational Freedom. “These kinds of polarizing topics are poisoning the well for other things that havebipartisan support. Once issues like student loan forgiveness are put to rest, I think a lot more of thatbipartisan agreement will emerge.”It’s one of the few areas of common ground between Harris and Trump.In his platform, the former Republican president said he will “support the creation of additional, drasticallymore affordable alternatives to a traditional four-year college degree.” It doesn’t mention loans. Trump hasopposed cancellation, saying it’s illegal.“President Trump will implement real solutions to make education, housing, and the cost of living affordableagain for young people so they can live the American dream,” Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary forTrump’s 2024 presidential campaign, told the AP. 12/16/24, 5:19 PM Harris stays quiet on student loans as cancellation loses its political luster | AP News chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/3Student loan advocates point to Trump’s vague promises, failure to ﬁx Public Service Loan Forgiveness andappointment of the judges who stymied broad student debt relief. “Trump is proud of his work to hurtworking families,” said Melissa Byrne, a political organizer who has pushed for cancellation.Fate of further student loan cancellation unclearAs attorney general in California, Harris led efforts to penalize for-proﬁt colleges for defrauding borrowers.As a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris proposed a narrower path to loan forgiveness than those pushedby Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Harris’ plan would have provided $20,000 in relief to anyfederal Pell Grant recipient who started a business in a disadvantaged community and kept it running forthree years.After the Biden administration announced this month that it had canceled loans for more than 1 millionpublic service workers, Harris issued a statement applauding the work, again generally promising to continuemaking “higher education more affordable.”Aissa Canchola Bañez, political director at Protect Borrowers Action, said Harris’ track record on student debtrelief suggests that she would uphold the pledges made under Biden.“This is an issue that she has been working on since long before her time coming to Washington, D.C.,”Canchola Bañez said, pointing to the unprecedented amount of student loan debt forgiven under the Bidenadministration. “We’ve seen the vice president come out very forcefully applauding the relief that has comeout thus far.”___The Associated Press’ education coverage receives ﬁnancial support from multiple private foundations.
