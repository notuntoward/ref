Newkome Date iii ABSTRACT Every day Americans drive countless miles on the millions of miles of roads. As this general trend continues to climb, it has led to an increasing demand in the diminishing oil supply and an increase in greenhouse gas production. Although many solutions have been proposed, the most viable option currently entering the market and gaining widespread support is the electric car. Manufactures, utility companies and government entities have raised the question of how well will these vehicles perform in the consumer market. This is not only critical to estimating the level of required charging infrastructure but also the reliability of projected economic benefits. This paper proposes to use a diffusion model to study the future market of PEVs. Sales data from hybrid cars are taken to estimate the diffusion model coefficients. Then, a consumer value matrix is employed to simulate the effects of changes in the consumer market that would influence a consumer’s decision whether or not to purchase a vehicle. From these estimates, short term market growth projections have been made and found capable of reflecting consumer’s reaction to different market growth scenarios. iv ACKNOWLEGMENTS I would like my adviser Dr Ping Yi for his critical guidance, support and encouragement throughout the master degree.

Vehicles powered by fossil fuel have an impact on not only the environment but also nonrenewable resources such as oil. As the price of oil goes up, alternative fuels begin to look more attractive to consumers. There have been many options proposed ranging from fuel cells to compress air. In the past decade auto manufactures have introduced hybrid vehicles. These vehicles are propelled by an electric engine for speed up to approximately 30mph and a conventional gasoline engine for speeds greater than that. This type of vehicle has been well received by consumers with over 2 million vehicles being sold by the end of 2010. Several model of hybrid vehicles are shown in figure 1.1 FIGURE 1.1 Examples of Hybrid Cars 2 One option is to use electricity to power vehicles. This option relies upon a fuel source that is readily available. This option not only provides economic advantages from the reduced cost per mile traveled but also environmental benefits from using clean methods of energy production. This option has gained consumer interest and support from the government. There is a widespread interest in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) in the past decade. This has prompted various automakers to develop their own HEVs and the technology associated with it. This has led to the development of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) also know as battery electric vehicles (BEV). For remainder of this manuscript they will be referred to as PEVs. Examples of PEVs and PHEVs are shown in figure 1.2. FIGURE 1.2 Examples of PHEVs and PEVs There is a common misconception in the general public on the differences between these vehicles. HEVs rely on an electric propulsion system for speeds lower than 30 mph and an internal combustion engine for speeds greater than that. PHEVs are driven by an electric propulsion system. They are also equipped range extending equipment in the form of a gasoline generator that recharges the vehicle battery in the event of battery 3 depletion. PEVs are driven by an electric propulsion system. These vehicles are equipped with higher capacity batteries and have longer ranges before battery depletion. Both PHEVs and PEVs rely on charging stations or more commonly referred to as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) by manufactures. EVSE comes in various configurations and levels of power delivery based upon manufacture’s specifications. In order to clear up confusion about the difference in equipment, EVSE is classified as one of three levels. This is shown in Table 1.1. The current and voltage levels are subject to change according to manufactures specifications. The charging times vary due to the capacity of the battery. Table 1.1 EVSE Equipment Types Level I II III Voltage 120 v 240 v 440 v Current 16 amps 30 amp 125 amps Charging Times 8-12 hours 4-6 hours 15-30 min Power Equivalent Hair Dryer Clothing Dryer Electric Welder Level 1 charging equipment is ideal for home due to the charging time. An advantage this level offers is that many models plug into standard household outlets. Level 2 can be either used for commercial use or home use. Wiring capable of handling the electrical load may need to be installed if it is not installed already. The reduced charging time would ideal for locations that consumers would be spending a considerable amount of 4 time but not as much as they would at home. Examples of these locations would be work place or a parking deck. Consumers tend to lead busy lives and don’t want to be stuck at one location for extended periods of time. This has led to the development of level 3 charging station. One advantage of this level is the greatly reduced charging time. This would be ideal for shopping locations and rest areas where consumers would be spending limited amounts of time and connectivity between cities is required. Examples of these charging stations are shown in figure 1.3. FIGURE 1.3 Models of EVSE Equipment There are many problems areas that arise when new technologies are developed. Some problems that arise related to PEVs and PHEV are vehicle range, placement of charging stations, and projection of the consumer acceptance. Many people in industry and government entities have raised the question of how well these vehicles will fit consumer needs. 5 The successful deployment of PEVs will be predicated on the development of effective supporting infrastructure. This in turn has raised the problem of determining what will be the level of consumer acceptance in the mass market. This is not only critical to estimating the level of required charging infrastructure but also the reliability of projected economic and environmental benefits. 1.1 Objectives There are objectives in this study and they are as follows. Objective One: The first objective is to exam consumer behavior and purchasing habits. Based upon those findings, develop a technology diffusion model to explain consumer behavior and the timing of adoption of new technology. Objective Two: The second objective is to establish methodology for calibrating the parameters for the diffusion model based upon consumer values and value fulfillment. Objective Three: The third objective is to successfully identify similar products with mature sales history and use them for model calibration based upon reliability of fit. Objective Four: The forth objective is to simulate the effects of different market conditions and the consumer response along with mass market acceptance of PEVs 6 Objective Five: The fifth objective is to apply the developed model to current PEV models currently in the market place and project the long term sales based upon first year sales. 1.2 Overview of Thesis A brief outline of the chapters within this thesis is described in sections 1.2.1 through 1.2.4. Detailed discussion of these chapters II through IV are provided later in the thesis 1.2.1 Chapter II Chapter II provides an overview of past research and literature that pertains to current research. This section examines variety of approaches whose objective is to explain the adaptation of alternative fuel vehicles. These approaches include statistical choice models, influence of driving habits and influence of consumer preference. 1.2.2 Chapter III Chapter III establishes methodology that was used in the entirety of this research. The strengths and weaknesses of the selected approach are explained here. The selected approach is examined for its application variety of market conditions and consumer acceptance levels. Chapter III proposes a method for calibration for the model parameters in the previously mentioned chapter. The need for this method is explained here with the short term and long term benefits of the approach. 7 1.2.3 Chapter IV Chapter V takes sales data from hybrid cars to calibrate the diffusion model parameters. These parameters are used as the base case for simulation. Then several scenarios are established that are representative of real market scenarios. The consumer reactions to these conditions are examined and the long term consumer acceptance is projected. 1.2.4 Chapter V Chapter VI evaluates the established model for the completion of objects and comments on the practicality of the results. The real world applications of this model for manufactures and law makers are investigated. Possible goals for future improvement is explored in this section and with the possibility of integration of a GIS based platform. 8 CHAPTER II LITERATURE REVIEW Many attempts have been made to study the consumer market though only in recent years some limited work devoted to the PEV and PHEV markets have emerged. These previous attempts took a variety of approaches. They focused on hybrid cars and other alternative fuels but their primary objective was to explain to what would prompt a consumer to choose to switch from a vehicle propelled by a traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) to a vehicle powered by a source that was less taxing on the environment and the oil supply. The same focus can apply to the PEVs and HEVs. 2.1 Statistical Choice Models Lieby et al. [2] proposed the transitional alternative fuels and vehicle model as an attempt to understand the alternative fuel market. This model focused on interaction of factors that affect long term sustainability. These factors include, vehicle demand and choice, flex fuel vehicle choice and use, retail fuel supply and availability, vehicle production, motor fuel production and raw material supply. This model made sales estimates that focused fleet users being the first to purchase the vehicle followed by non- 9 fleet users several years after introduction. Fleet adoption was modeled using fleet mandates for use of alternative fuel. Non fleet demand was modeled using a nested multinomial logit choice formulation. The authors state that their results were quite preliminary and not benchmarked against fuel and vehicle price and quantity. In addition to this, the authors expressed concern of the models ability to emulate regional effects. In addition to this the consumer demand was modeled using a limited set of static attributes related to product attributes that consumers may take into consideration when selecting a vehicle. The values were equally weighted and left no provision for adaptation consumer preference of specific attributes over others. Eppstein et al. [3] suggested using an agent based model as a consumer influence model. This model used a stochastic process to determine if a consumer decided to purchase a vehicle based upon a hierarchy of factors. These factors included the need of a new vehicle, social network influences, vehicle cost, and vehicle benefits. These consumers were coded as individual agents with a range of socio-economic factors. Each factor was assigned a threshold where a consumer would be more inclined to purchase a vehicle. The thresholds were dependant to the socio-economic information. Once all of these thresholds were exceeded, then a consumer would decide to purchase a vehicle. In order to capture the effects of media advertising and social influence, a social network was established for each agent. This social network could positively or negatively affect the value thresholds that influenced the consumer’s decision to purchase a vehicle. In their conclusion, it was commented that the researcher’s data wasn’t complete and there were doubts about its accuracy. Due to these issues, the authors could not guarantee 10 accurate predictions and could not conclude if a more complex model was warranted or how reliable their results were. 2.2 Influence Driving Habits The plug-in hybrid petroleum reduction model developed by Vyas et al. [4] took a differ approach from the other models. These authors began by examining daily driving distance for consumers based upon the NHTS travel survey. From this data they were able to estimate the percentage of consumers who would be able to drive their entire commute using an electric vehicle. This was determined to be ultimate market size for these vehicles. Once that was determined, a logit model was established. This model was configured to mirror the adaptation trends of new fuel and power train technology. This model used battery range as the only limiting factor to prevent adoption of the new technology. This model did not examine any factors other factor that would improve or worsen the overall rate of market adoption. 2.3 Consumer preference Liven et al. [5] conducted a study in Germany to examine consumer preference. This study began by examining factors that might influence a consumer’s decision to purchase a vehicle such as price, range, performance, environment, durability and convenience. 11 Then, the authors continued the survey to have consumers rank these factors based upon the different vehicle types such as compact cars, SUVs, etc that consumers drove. From this survey they determined the probability of a consumer buying an electric vehicle and made projections based upon historical sales data. These projections were determined by assuming consumers who showed interest in purchasing an electric vehicle would do right away and assumed that the same level of interest was shared with the entire populations. The authors examined the trend in purchase factors based upon the type of vehicle the consumer would purchase. In vehicle types price of the vehicle was the most important factors. The level of importance declined when consumer who purchased luxury or sports vehicles. Bass [6] suggested a diffusion model to predict sales of different technologies. Bass began by analyzing consumer behavior theory that has been deeply examined and developed a model to explain the observations made in timing of adoption of new technology. This model divides the number of first time adopters (the market potential) in two groups of consumers. These two groups are innovators (early adopters) and imitators (mass market adopters). The innovator group is the smaller portion of consumers that are very accepting of new technology and aren’t influenced to adopt new technology by the decision of other consumers in a social system. [6] The imitator group is composed of the larger portion of consumers that adopt the technology later in the market life cycle. Consumers in this group are much more prone to base their adoption timing based upon the pressures from their social system. This pressure is highly influence from the previous cumulative 12 number of adopters. This model considers the rate of technology adoption as exponential based upon when each consumer group adopted the technology. This model was then examined for use in the future when new products were introduced. This was accomplished by compiling sales data from existing products and making sales projections based upon only sales from the first several years. These projections were then compared to the actually using regression analysis. These projections produced R2 values that ranged from .72-.95. The author commented that the projections improved in accuracy when more data was used to estimate the model parameters. This model was able to make sales projects for a variety of different product ranging from televisions to lawnmowers. Orbach et al. [7] presented a model that forecasts sales and product evolution based on data on market and industry. In their model, adoption of a new product is considered to be motivated by attribute improvements and the model forms attribute improvement strategies based on market growth directed by market preferences. The interdependency between attributes' improvements and cumulative adoption level makes their problem inherently dynamic. This model is demonstrated on the hybrid car market, where the dependency of attribute levels on adoption levels is assessed using industry and technology analysis. Their results suggest a 5% of annual auto sales in Germany but did not discuss the growth or decline of the estimated sales. Other studies can be found in the literature that attempt to address similar issues in the market to those discussed above. Though sophisticated in nature, most of the existing 13 models produced results that in many cases over project sales of hybrid vehicles when compared to actual sales data Many of these models have had only limited success because they do not take into account consumer behavior. This determines if and when a consumer decides to purchase a product. This can be influenced by several factors such as price, specific product features, time or money savings ect. Interaction between the market side and consumer side is critical to Further study in this area, especially with respect to PEVs, is needed because PEVs represents an emerging market. This need is further emphasized by the recent introduction of several models of PEVs and PHEVs to the consumer marketplace. In addition, the PEV market is affected not only by the consumer behavior but also by government policy which influences the price of vehicle due to rebates and other tax credits. Given the nature of this issue, an effort is needed to study the PEV market in a manner that is focused but also adaptable to changes in the market environment. 14 CHAPTER III METHODOLOGY 3.1 Market Acceptance This research proposes to study the PEV market using an approach similar to the diffusion model. This approach was chosen because of the reliability of predictions for a variety of products. In addition to this, this approach is adaptable to a variety of product diffusion rates and market sizes. This approach requires relatively less information than more complex data intensive models. This proposed model divides the consumer market into innovators and imitators. The defining theory is built on the premise that once innovator market starts to become saturated the imitator market will begin adopting the technology and drive the majority of sales when sales reach their peak. The timing of peak adoption is determined by the rate of adoption The rate of adoption is determined through the coefficients of innovation ( ) and imitation ( ). The coefficient of innovation determines the number of initial consumers and is based on a number of different factors. The coefficient of imitation determines the 15 rate of mass market adoption and ultimate market saturation percentage. This is expressed in Equation 2.1. (3.1) Where A’ = number of vehicles sold A(t) = cumulative number of vehicle sold = market potential The first term of the equation ( ) explains the initial adoption of a new technology by the innovator group. Since this group is the smaller portion of the market, the early sales years of the new product will not be as robust as in the successive years. The consumers who adopt the new product in the early are not as easily influenced by social pressure to adopt the new product because of limited or no sales. This has been shown in many technologies that gained mass market acceptance such as color television, air conditioners, and microwaves (7). The second term ( ) explains the rate that the imitation group adopts the new technology. As the number of adoptions increases, the rate of adoption increases. This rate is determined by and the cumulative number of previous adopters ( ). This is due to increasing social pressure for consumer who have not yet adopted the technology to adopt the technology. The timing of the peak adoption is expressed in equations 3.2. (3.2) As the market approaches the full potential ) , A’(t) begins to decline as the number of previous adopters A(T) increases till the market reaches equilibrium which is shown in 16 the third term of the equation ( ). After this point any sales of the product are from repeat customers or just the natural growth of the market with time. This model presents great potential for forecasting growth but in the case of PEVs and PHEVs, limited data is available to calibrate the model parameters and the model itself posses little ability for predict the effects of various market conditions that would affect a consumers decision to purchase a vehicle. 3.2 Parameter Estimation In an attempt to address the problems mentioned in the previous sections the following methodology is proposed. It is necessary to examine the effects of different factors on the overall market growth. Before the analysis can be undertaken, coefficients and will need to be estimated. This is accomplished though the implementation of the consumer value matrix by means of computing a composite index for each coefficient. The matrix formulation is shown in Equation 3.3 (or 3.4), which features three terms: Vi, Xij, and αj (or βj). Vi presents differently weighted values (Vi) such as price, function or safety that influence a consumer’s decision to purchase a product. [6] These weights can change based upon the importance a consumer places on a value i. These values can be determined through consumer survey towards the product j. Xij reflects market reality and it determines how well product j fulfils value i and can be estimated by using the existing market data. Several similar products are generally chosen for the estimation of α’ and β’. This is done in order to isolate the effects of anomalies in the coefficients. These 17 coefficients (α’ and β’) will be representative of the baseline market conditions that market acceptance scenarios will be simulated through. '= (3.3) '= (3.4) It should be noted that Xij used in Equations 3.3 and 3.4 can differ because it applies to different groups of consumers (innovators vs. imitators) whose purchase decision may be influenced by different factors. In order to examine the future market for PEVs we propose to examine new models of PEVs using the same methodology by which the previous products were examined. We adopted and estimated from Equations 3.3 and 3.4 and used them to represent the market response to new technology based on historical data. In addition, the effects of changes in the market factors (Xjk) can be shown by applying Equations 3.3 and 3.4. Equation 3.3 shows the effects of changes in consumer value fulfillment in the early stages of product sales by modifying . Equation 3.4 shows similar effects in the later stages of product sales by modifying . Then, sale projections for the new product can be made by substituting s 3.5 and 3.6 respectively 18 (3.5) (3.6) (Xjk refers to market data for PEV) 19 CHAPTER IV IMPLEMENTATION 4.1 Case Study In order to implement the proposed diffusion model for the PEV/PHEV market growth study, we selected hybrid cars in the test because they are considered to have the greatest similarity to PEV and maturity in the consumer market. Electric vehicles were not chosen because lack of available data and limited attempts for mass market integration. We obtained sales data from the Department of Energy [12], which include many domestic and foreign models. The complete listing of vehicles examined are shown in the appendix. We further used Toyota Prius, Honda Civic Hybrid and Ford Escape Hybrid for this study based upon market maturity and availability of data from 2000 to 2010. These vehicles were chosen based upon the similarity in configuration to models of PHEVs and PEVs currently entering the market. The implementation begins by analyzing the sales data to estimate α, β and τ. These coefficients are estimated by taking multi-year sales data and reverse calculating by means of regression analysis for the diffusion model shown in Equation 3.1. The detailed mathematical process is complex and not presented here; the results obtained together with the coefficient of determination and the p-value of testing are shown in Table 4.1. 20 TABLE 4.1 Diffusion Model Coefficients for Hybrid Cars During the examination of various hybrid vehicles, difficulties arose during the examination of the data. Certain data sets were hard to model due to unknown reasons. There were other sets that couldn’t be modeled but that was due to limited sales data or because general decline in auto sales regardless of model in the more recent years of the sales data. Next, consumer values were examined for consumers likely and not likely to purchase an electric vehicle at present time. The consumers likely to purchase an electric vehicle in the near future will be representative of the innovation group and the consumer not likely to purchase an electric vehicle in the near future will be representative of imitation group due to their reluctance to purchase an electric vehicle till the technology is better established. We studied the factors that affect a consumer’s choice to purchase a vehicle in a consumer study report [13], where consumers are separated into the two groups in the survey based on their preference of purchasing an electric vehicle. The reason for this division of consumers was due to the observations made by Bass about consumer values. In addition to this, limited work has been conducted to examine motivation for consumers to purchase a vehicle. Model Τ (Vehicles) α β R2 p-value Toyota Prius 2875826 0.001645368 1.455182 0.962873 0.001 Civic Hybrid 3685991 0.003437559 0.631287 0.956147 0.001 Ford Escape 368377 0.03673027 0.432231 0.999401 0.001 21 We summarized the findings from the top 5 consumer values that are shared by and differentiate the two consumer groups in Table 4.2. It can be seen that even the first three values are similar; the last two are what separates the two groups. This distinction for values in the two groups is critical. The innovation group is focused more on the latest improvements in technology for addressing the concerns such as operation reliability or reducing their carbon footprint, whereas the imitation group cares more about the long term effects of their purchase such as safety and future tax rebates. Then, the values were normalized (to percentages) based upon the frequency of response and adapted as Vi in Table 4.2. It should be noted that it was assumed there would be a separation of values depending on when the consumer decided to purchase a vehicle. TABLE 4.2 Consumer Purchase Values V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 Innovation Vehicle Price (66.8%) Gas Saving (51.6%) Price of Gas (36.7%) Amount of emissions produced (36.7%) Operation Reliability (34%) Imitation Vehicle Price (63.3%) Gas Saving (49.6%) Price of Gas (29.1%) Availability of Future Tax benefits (25.4%) Vehicle crash record (23.6%) For our research study we decided that to use these values for our study. The basis for this decision was due to the similarities that major auto manufactures advertise in order to entice consumers to purchase their product. In addition to this, information in order to measure these factors are easily available to consumers. The methods of measurement for each of the factors are discussed in the next section. 22 4.2 Measurement of consumer values These values that influence a consumer’s decision can change with time and some can be subject to volatility. In order to measure how well manufactures were able to fulfill these values, we proposed to measure these with a comparison to a moving average. This gave us the advantage of being adaptive to changes over time and also employed common benchmarks that consumers use for measurement of these values. The following method is used in our study to measure how well a product fulfills the values for each consumer group. We divided the consumer values into two groups. While the price of vehicle, price of gas, and fuel economy are all key preferences for both innovators and imitators, the innovators require necessary assurance that the vehicle is reliable to operate and may be environmentally more conscious. The imitators tend to be more practical in their values such as vehicle crash record and long term savings. Accordingly, we formulated Equations 4.1 through 4.7 to calculate Xij for the two consumer groups. The first three equations are common for both the innovator and imitator groups, and the rest of the equations are group specific. In Equation 4.3, gas savings are calculated based upon increases in fuel economy from normal gasoline engines and the price of gasoline; they are calculated in this manner because consumers would measure savings based upon the decrease in gasoline spending. Emissions examined in Equation 4.5 are based upon the EPA’s air pollution score in relation to the maximum possible score [10]. Vehicle crash record is assessed based upon frontal offset 23 crash test results in which vehicles receive ratings of good, acceptable, marginal or poor [11]. As the rating declines, the value fulfillment score declines as well. X1j = (4.1) Where pavg=Average new vehicle price p= price of vehicle X2j = (4.2) Where pg= Yearly average price of gasoline pgmax=Historical maximum gasoline price X3j = (4.3) Where M=estimated fuel economy Mavg= Average fuel economy Innovator values X4j =Reliability of Operation (4.4) Where 1= yes 0= no X5j = (4.5) Where S=EPA air pollution score (9) Imitator Values X4j= Availability of Tax Benefits (4.6) Where 1= yes 0= no 24 X5j= Frontal offset crash test results (4.7) (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (10)) Where Good =1 Acceptable=.75 Marginal=.5 Poor=.25 TABLE 4. 3 Value Constants Constants Value Pavg $28,500(Average new vehicle price 2010 federal trade commission) [14] $4.054/gal [15] Mavg 27.5mpg (Average fuel economy for passenger cars NHTSA 2010) [16] Using all the values for Vi, Xij, and from the above steps, we calculated ’ and ’ through Equations 3.3 and 3.4 and used those coefficients for the next step to study the PEV market. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the model we proposed 3 different scenarios of market conditions. In each test scenario, we used Equations 3.5 and 3.6 to determine ’’ and ’’, where Xik are calculated from Equations 4.1 to 4.7 using the market data for PEV shown in Table 4. Note that we used “able to charge at home” to replace “operation reliability” in because they address very similar issues from the consumer’s prospective. Further, we gave a good rating for safety but the model can easily adopt any PEV market data in the future. Then, ’’ and ’’ were put into the 25 diffusion model in place of and and sales were forecasted for 10 years after product introduction. The sales are expressed as percentage of ultimate market potential. Even though this model is designed for individual products, general trends of the market acceptance factors will become evident regardless of the specific brand name or the advertising efforts from manufactures. Three market scenarios are shown in Table 4.4. The first test scenario represents the current situation of the market. This scenario represents the current efforts to make this technology available for widespread use. The second scenario represents an ideal market and surrounding conditions. What defines an “ideal” market depends on several factors that influence a consumer to purchase a vehicle. The first factor would be price. This could influence by the manufactures lowering the cost of the vehicle through improved production techniques or government subsidies offered to manufacturers for the offset of emissions. Another factor is the price of gasoline. This factor is harder to control because oil is a commodity that is subject to fluctuation based upon demand. The only way it could positively influence sales would be if gasoline prices were near their historical high. This also affects gas savings as well. This one offers more ability for control because gas savings can be amplified through investments in technology advancement and battery management. The last case is representative of negative market. These market factors are opposite of those in the ideal case. There are a variety causes that would lead to this market scenario. The first would be a dramatic increase of the price of the vehicle. This could be caused by the discontinuation of the current tax credit, increasing cost of battery supplies and other 26 cost components. Another cause could small gains in gas saving. This would be the result of poor vehicle performance or improvements in conventional ICE vehicles. TABLE 4.4 Proposed Market Test Scenarios Scenario Price of vehicle Price of Gas Able to charge at home Emission score Tax Rebate Safety Rating 1 $28,500 $3.50/gal Yes 10 yes good 0.02 0.243 2 $14,250 $4.05/gal yes 10 yes good 0.025 0.313 3 $57,000 $2.00/gal no 10 no good 0.005 0.047 4.3 RESULTS DISCUSSION The sales projections for all three scenarios are shown in Figure 1.The growth for all three scenarios was languid in the first several years, which is to be expected as the majority of consumers wait for the technology to become more proven. In scenario 3 the sales for the vehicles failed to reach the exponential growth that successful products experience in the consumer market. This is a result of the product failing to fulfill consumer values. This is shown in the market increases peaking at 0.75%, and it can be due to many reasons. The first is the cost to the consumer which has direct and indirect 27 parts. The direct cost is the high price of the vehicle which is exacerbated by the unavailability of a tax benefits. The indirect cost to the consumer can be caused by the decline in gasoline savings. The final reason for the poor performance in scenario 3 is the inability to charge at home. In scenarios 1 and 2, vehicle sales began to show fast increases in sales which are an indication of mass market acceptance. This is validated by the market increases peaking at 7.01% for scenario 1 and 9.14% for scenario 2. This can be attributed to the electric vehicle adequately fitting consumer demands. In addition to the direct influences, outside influences such as the price of gasoline and the consumers social network provided justification for consumers to purchase an electric vehicle.

Further work will need to be completed to examine the PEV demand distribution in a more detailed and region specific manner. This will be conducted in a separate effort that employs socioeconomic and trip making data on a GIS based platform. 29 CHAPTER V CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS In an effort to plan for the changes needed in infrastructure, the question of what will be the expected PEV market growth has been raised. Other researchers have proposed models with limited applications but none in the context of PEV market study. These past studies had limited ability to model the consumer side and the market side of technology diffusion and the interaction of these two sides. The diffusion model proposed by Bass examined the extensive work done on consumer behavior theory. This model was able to successfully model the adoption of various technologies. This model has its own limitations. The primary limitation is the model cannot future sales in cases when sales data is limited or nonexistent. In order to solve this issue, the consumer value matrix has been proposed to estimate the diffusion model parameters based on upon the diffusion of similar technologies. After this was completed, consumer values were examined in order to effectively use the developed methodology. The modified diffusion model proposed to meet this challenge in this study appears capable of estimating PEV demand growth as affected by a number of factors including 30 vehicle price, price of gasoline, gasoline savings, the ability to charge at home, availability of tax benefits, vehicle crash record and amount of emission produced. The order of these values doesn’t have an effect on the results due to the matrix procedure. What does have an effect on the sensitivity of the result is the proportion that each factor directs a consumer to purchase or not purchase a vehicle. This model has many areas that it excels but there are limitations to this model. There are certain events that would difficult for the model to forecast. Events such as the introduction of a low cost ICE vehicle that has high gasoline mileage or the failure a particular model of vehicle battery can be detrimental to the sales of PEVs. In additions to this, there may be factors that consumers consider when it comes time to purchase a vehicle that aren’t considered before the purchase. These results might change when consumer motivation is examined in the future. The findings of a future study might provide indication that consumer shouldn’t be divided to separate groups. On the contrary it may give confirmation that the assumption to divide them and their values was the correct one. Even though there are limitations, this proposed model has the potential of remaining valid in the future due to the adaptability in its design. The product relation matrix has been employed to estimate the coefficients of the diffusion model. This matrix is able to adjust the diffusion model in the future when factors that affect the consumer’s choice to purchase an electric vehicle change. The results are based upon model calibration using market data from similar but established products to PEVs, and the three test scenarios are based on today’s market information and projection at the time of the research. When 31 the actual market data gradually becomes available in the years to come, the coefficients used in the model can be adjusted accordingly in the fine tuning process to reflect the dynamics of the market. In addition, the selection of each consumer value and the values themselves can be changed to accommodate market evolutions while perpetuating the primary principals of technology diffusion. The abiltiy of future development of this model looks promising. With the advent and development of geographic information systems (GIS) software, a new range of possibilities has opened up for this model. With the examination of examination of socio- economic data and regional trends, forecasts can possibly be made down to the city or county level. This model can potentially be used as a decision making supporting tool for government entities in policy development to identify the best return on investment. It could identify areas to that are in need to charging station infrastructure. Also give guidance for public information campaigns and time tables for the duration of tax rebates for vehicles or their charging equipment. It can also aid auto manufactures in understanding and properly planning to meet customer demand by modifying their business model. Markets that have fast early growth that are critical to long term adoption can be located in addition to emerging markets. Also manufactures will be able to know well in advance when the these vehicles will begin to reach mass adoption. With this knowledge manufactures can lower the cost of production through measures such raw material acquisition, production 32 capacity increases, ect. These savings can be passed on to the consumer through a lowered vehicle price. Other industries can benefit as well from these projections as well. Vehicle repair shop will know when to be know when to upgrade their facilities and train their employes in order to service these vehicles. Over time these vehicles will achieve mass adoption. As these vehicles reach their ultimate potential, the original problems of dependence on non-renewable fuels and increased emission will be solved. This solution will be able to provide the consumers with the ability to maintain their busy lives with minimal interruption. Before this future can become a reality, the preliminary groundwork must be laid. 33 REFERENCES 1.
