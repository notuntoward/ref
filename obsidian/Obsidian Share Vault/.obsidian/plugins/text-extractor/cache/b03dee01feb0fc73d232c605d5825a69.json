Introduction Economic growth of any country is driven by its sources of energy. Globalization and industrialization has led to depletion of nonrenewable sources of energy. All countries are now looking for alternate sources of energy, among them solar energy is the one source and its harnessing is growing around the world. The total energy that can be intercepted from sun is 1.8 \u0001 1011 MW, much more than what is required by humans on the earth for their consumption. Moreover, it is a clean and reliable source of energy that has the capability to meet the future needs. Solar energy can be utilized directly, into thermal and photo voltaic energy, as well as indirectly into water power, biomass, wind, wave energy, ocean thermal and marine currents [1]. Harnessing of solar energy has great scope in India. Out of total installed renewable energy, 87669 MW till 30th June 2020, solar energy has a share of 34811.78 MW till April 2020 [2]. Out of total 365 days, India receives an hourly radiation of 200 MW/km 2 for an average of 300 days. Jawahar Lal Nehru solar mission has set up a feed –in –tariff regime to increase the utilization of solar energy. Rajasthan and Gujrat are even providing offers for enhancing solar energy production [1]. Earlier, grid tariff was considered a cheap source of energy, but now the costs of solar energy has also come as down as ₹ 20 per kwh to ₹ 3.13 per kwh in the last 5 years as the manufacturing scale has gone up. However, there are certain fac- tors that decide the utilization of solar energy such as geographical and weather condition, solar irradiance, and load consumption [3]. The widely used technology for solar energy utilization these days is solar PV system. PV system plays an important role in reducing global warming and reaching climate change goals [4,5,6,25]. The PV frameworks are capable of converting sun ener- gy into electrical energy. The important aspect here is that Electri- cal energy obtained from the sun need to be stored to be supplied during off-sunshine hour. Apart from electrical energy, solar energy has also many other applications like it can be used for water heating, room heating, solar pump, dryer etc [23,24]. This goal can be achieved either using the batteries or by connecting the power system to a grid [7,8,9,21]. Domestic and MSME can be highly beneﬁtted by standalone roof top systems to reduce their peak load. Performance ratio is an important variable to evaluate the PV efﬁciency. It basically gives relationship between actual and theoretical outputs of solar energy, irrespective of different https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2020.08.785 2214-7853/\u0001 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Sharma et al., Design and simulation of standalone solar PV system using PVsyst Software: A case study, Materials Today: Proceedings, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2020.08.785 losses like inverter inefﬁciency, cable losses, cell mismatch losses, module temperature losses etc. The vital parameters are the solar yield, Performance Ratio and system losses. The Performance Ratio can have different values depending upon the ambient conditions, mounting system and electrical design [10,11,12,13,20]. During high temperature days, the performance of the solar PV cell modules can be increased by using coolants that prevent them from overheating [26]. Perfect location speciﬁc process parameters are necessary for design and development, operation, maintenance and capacity of roof top PV system [11]. The production of energy through photovoltaic system can be calculated using various simulation models like PVsyst, INSEL, TRNSYS, PVSOL, SOLARPRO etc., and Economic assessment tools are HOMER, Solar Advisor Model (SAM), RETScreen, SOLinvest and Energy Periscope. These software’s also helps in ﬁnding out the performance ratio and reduce loses. The meteorological database for simulation can be taken from AEMET European Solar Radiation Atlas, NASA, METEONORM, ISPRA-GIS, HELIOS, Solaris, PV-Design Pro, etc. for this paper, data has been taken from METEONORM and PVsyst simulation has been used [14,15]. 1.1. PVsyst software PVsyst is a simulation software that was ﬁrst of all designed in Geneva and helps in calculating the working and operations of PV system. This software helps in designing the conﬁguration of the system and also enables to calculate the amount of energy generated. The output is based on the simulation of the sizing system which further depends mainly on geographical site location of PV system. Results may include several simula- tion variables that can be displayed in monthly, daily or hourly values. The ‘‘Loss Diagram” predicts the weaknesses in the sys- tem design [16,19]. Simulation in PVSyst is carried out in fol- lowing steps 1.1.1. Deﬁning the project Different sites and meteo ﬁles are already present in the PVSyst databases but one can create his own projects depending upon the location of the site and meteo ﬁles that are to be used. 1.1.2. Creating a system variant: Calculation version of the project created in step 1 is created by the user. Module orientation, system conﬁguration and loss param- eters are to be deﬁned by the user 1.1.3. Running the simulation: Simulation generates different graphs and reports for the the PV system. The user can analyze the results in the program, export them to a different program or save the results for further evalua- tion. [17,18] The objectives of present study are as follows: \u0003 To assess the potential of solar energy at the given site. \u0003 To calculate the minimum load required to run the Mechanical Department ofﬁce in case of electric power failure. \u0003 To design PV system and its layout based on load requirement. \u0003 To determine performance ratio and losses using PVsyst soft- ware simulation.

In this paper, a stand-alone solar photovoltaic sys- tem is studied for its losses and its performance is also highlighted. Losses due to different reasons are investigated and the perfor- mance of the plant is monitored by its performance ratio. Here we have used PVsyst simulation to evaluate the losses across dif- ferent ﬁelds and also calculated the performance ratio by simu- lated performance. Generally, Execution of the plant measures the energy, sun-based asset, and effect of total PR and losses. 3. Stand-alone PV system design Roof top standalone systems are not connected to any electric- ity grid and can have capacities from few milli-Watts to several kilo-Watts. Roof top standalone systems work on batteries and have solar modules, controller and inverter as main components [1,22]. A mount structure is made, over which solar modules are mounted and they produce DC power. Charge controller channels this power and charges the battery. Controller has dual function to perform; one is to charge the battery and second is to prevent overcharging of batteries. They eliminate any of the reverse current ﬂow from batteries back into the solar modules during night. The energy stored in the battery during day time can be used anytime, day and night. The inverter can invert the energy stored in the bat- tery to VAC current to run AC appliances.Other accessories like cables are also required and these need to be ultra- violet safe and sensible for open-air applications. It is exception- ally imperative to keep control losses and voltage drop inside the cable to the slightest [1]. 3.1. Designing A.

Kumar, C.S. Rajoria, A. Sharma et al. Materials Today: Proceedings xxx (xxxx) xxx 4 4.2. Layout of Stand-Alone system Within the off-grid PV framework, the inverter mod- ule should be chosen from the inverter database. All the strings of PV modules associated must be homogeneous suggests unde- ﬁned modules, the same number of modules in a course of action, the same presentation, etc. The ﬁgure underneath shows the schematic diagram of a stand-alone framework. The diode showed up here is the bypass diode utilized for the protection reason as ap- peared in Fig. 3. The power produced by the PV system is utilized with the min- imum losses as conceivable due to less energy solar abdicate of the solar PV system. Thus, it is required to minimize these losses by evacuating the components that impacts the losses produced within the PV system. Dust, rain, temperature is a few of the natu- ral variables that causes losses in PV system and other losses due to system components such as cables, inverters etc. 5. Simulation PVsyst software is used for simulation in this study. All the ﬁg- ures are generated through the simulation process for proposed site only. Since, the computational modeling has been done in this paper, so only simulation results have been discussed. Fig. 4. Performance Ratio and Solar Fraction. Fig. 5. Monthly Normalized productions with losses. R. Kumar, C.S. Rajoria, A. Sharma et al. Materials Today: Proceedings xxx (xxxx) xxx 5 The Table 5 underneath depicts the yearly equaliza- tions and fundamental outcomes about of off-grid PV framework. It can be seen that the vitality can be conveyed to the clien- t is 1068.12 kWh. The execution proportion within the simulation computer pro- gram was almost comparative for each month which is shown in Fig. 4. The performance ratio and solar fraction are also shown in Fig. 4 and numerical value of solar fraction for each month is shown in Table 5. The Performance ratio (PR) is the ratio of the ﬁnal PV system yield (Yf) and the reference yield (Yr) [27]. PR ¼ Y f Y r ð1Þ The highest PR was recorded in the month of December is 86% due to low module temperature and lowest PR 64% is obtained in the month of April due to the high temperature of the PV module. Whereas the annual average PR is 72.8%. The month to month vi- tality generation with the losses has appeared in Fig. 5. There are distinctive sorts of ﬁeld losses that happen within the stand- alone photovoltaic frameworks all through the year which is de- picted in Fig. 6. 6. Conclusion This paper presents the study of required load to run the ofﬁce in Mechanical department as shown in Table 1 and accordingly the stand alone system is designed. This system has also been studied further for its performance ratio and losses using PVsyst software. \u0003 From Table 5, it is evident that average annual energy require- ment in the ofﬁce of Department of Mechanical Engineering is 1086.24 kWh and the energy available through solar panel is 1143.6 kWh, whereas energy supplied to the user is 1068.12 kWh a little less than the required load. The reduced power capacity of the system is because of different kinds of losses. Fig. 6. Loss diagram for the whole year. R. Kumar, C.S. Rajoria, A. Sharma et al. Materials Today: Proceedings xxx (xxxx) xxx 6 \u0003 The performance ratio analysis reveals that the highest PR was recorded in the the month of December is 86% due to low mod- ule temperature and lowest PR, 64% was obtained in the month of April due to the high temperature of the PV module, Whereas the average PR for year is 72.8% as evident from Fig. 4. The working of the PV frameworks depends on material tech- nology, generation, and manufacturing process. The module be- haviour decides the losses in PV system simulation. The PVsyst computer program investigates all types of losses. PVsyst tries to utilize suited models for all parts of the PV framework, including all sources of losses .The Meteo information (source, and yearly inconstancy) the PV module model, and the legiti- macy of the manufacture details still remains the uncertain areas of PV production. It is possible to become self-sufﬁcient by instal- ling roof top solar panels as per the load requirement for domestic or small factories use. This paper can be helpful for further off grid designing and working.
