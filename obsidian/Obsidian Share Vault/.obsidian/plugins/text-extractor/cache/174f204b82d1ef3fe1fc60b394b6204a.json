Recently, many regulatory market environments are reorganized to allow short term electricity trading. This study seeks to quantify the beneﬁts of solar forecasting for energy imbalance markets (EIM). State-of-the-art solar forecasts, covering forecast horizons ranging from 24 h to 5 min are proposed and compared against the currently used benchmark models, persistence (P) and smart persistence (SP). The implemented reforecast of numerical weather prediction time series achieves a skill of 14.5% over the smart persistence model. Using the proposed forecasts for a forecast horizon of up to 75 min for a single 1 MW power plant re- duces required ﬂexibility reserves by 21% and 16.14%, depending on the allowed trading intervals (5 and 15 min). The probability of an imbalance, caused through wrong market bids from PV solar plants, can be reduced by 19.65% and 15.12% (for 5 and 15 min trading intervals). All EIM stakeholders beneﬁt from accurate forecasting. Previous estimates on the beneﬁts of EIMs, based on persistence model are con- servative. It is shown that the design variables regulating the market time lines, the bidding and the binding schedules, drive the beneﬁts of forecasting. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. 1. Introduction The electricity system is undergoing an inevitable change to address increased variability in generation and net load, introduced by intermittent generators, mainly wind and solar. Many ap- proaches to mitigate the adverse effects of ramping have been proposed, e.g. increased storage capabilities, resource and net load forecasting, demand response, etc. The core of all solutions for integrating higher levels of variable wind and solar generation is to increase the ﬂexibility options available in the grid [1,2]. Recently, regulating authorities in several jurisdictions reorganized the market environments to allow ﬂexible energy trading schedules, designed to better exploit spatial and temporal diversity in gener- ation and demand. Historically, this reorganization started in Northern Europe by allowing short-term, cross-border electricity trading, driven by the need to integrate increasing shares of vari- able wind generation. In October 2014, the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) in the Western Interconnection was opened in United States of America interconnecting over 30 participating balancing authorities (BAs) in USA and Canada. This allows for generation and demand balancing across Balancing Authority Areas (BAA) on 15 min and 5 min time- scales with California Independent System Operator (CAISO) over- sight. Previous to the opening, all the Balancing Authorities (BA) were responsible to balance generation and demand for their own area. Now, the ISO can dispatch and share resources across the participating BAAs to balance energy of all BAs. All EIM market participants are mandated to provide a continuous feed of speciﬁed forecasts to the ISO. Energy imbalances caused by errors in the forecasts and bidding are settled by the deﬁned settling regulation e.g. according to the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 890, for intermittent renewable gener- ators, imbalances greater than 7.5% or 10 MW are settled at 125% incremental cost or 75% decremental cost of providing the imbal- ance energy. In contrast to the dominance of wind as intermittent generator in Northern Europe, solar is the dominating intermittent energy source in many regions in the Western Interconnection with tremendous expected growth rates (e.g. California). On this background, this study aims to analyze and quantify the beneﬁts of solar forecasting for EIM operations. To achieve this, solar forecasts are implemented to cover all necessary forecast horizons for EIM operations. All implemented forecasts are state- * Corresponding author.

Energy imbalance markets 2.1. Goals The main objective for the introduction of EIMs is to reduce imbalances between demand and generation without ancillary services or additional reserves by enabling regulated, short-term energy trading between interconnected balancing areas. Without EIMs, resources were not shared between the balancing areas. The individual balancing area authorities had to schedule and keep operating reserves to handle imbalances. For the EIM in the Western Interconnection, after scheduling for 15 min market, the 5 min market is executed to automatically procure resources to balance expected imbalances between generation and demand in 5 min time intervals. Taking the advantage of increased geographical diversity in generation and load proﬁles, the main beneﬁts of this market are reduced operating reserves capacity, enhanced reliability, reduced costs and automatic dispatch, and real-time visibility. 2.2. Previous work This section covers a short summary of previous work, relevant for EIMs. A review on real-time markets is presented in Ref. [3].An overview of previous EIM studies can be found in Ref. [4]. They include a comparison of market regulations based on assumptions, annual beneﬁts, and geographic scope. The study includes beneﬁts of the implemented EIM between ISO and PaciﬁCorp. The impact for EIM, for grids with high levels of wind penetration, was studied in Ref. [5]. They show that the introduction of EIMs enables reserve requirement reductions which is beneﬁcial for all EIM participants. Furthermore, they show that the failure or refusal of participation by as little as one entity can reduce the beneﬁts for all other par- ticipants in the market. Using forecasts as a decision variable the bidders and market operator can commit or de-commit in case of high or low energy production [6]. An evaluation of energy balance and imbalance settlements in Europe is presented in Ref. [7]. A general framework for analyzing various components of market participation for wind generators was proposed in Ref. [8]. They discuss the value of information contained in forecasts for grids with high wind penetration. Conclusions cover that fore- casting has a high economic value for variable wind energy sources. For current status of wind penetration in CAISO, investment in short-term wind forecasting is precarious, whereas in future sce- narios with high wind penetration levels, forecasting can evolve into an important decision variable for real-time market operation, e.g. economic dispatch in the CAISO area [9]. A detailed analysis on organized markets in the Western Interconnection can be found in Ref. [10]. It highlights the factors inﬂuencing the success of EIMs, such as cost allocation, transmission rights, participation of various BAAs, stakeholders and discusses the alternatives to organized markets, for instance Intra-hour Transaction Accelerator Platform, the Dynamic Scheduling System, Balancing Authority Reliability- based Control, Area Control Error Diversity Interchange, Enhance Curtailment Calculator, etc. While these alternative market setups might be beneﬁcial in certain cases, the regulating authorities decided to operate an EIM in the Western Interconnection. The focus of our work is the EIM in the Western Interconnection in the United States. Most of the studies on the impact of EIM on Western and Eastern Interconnection assume forecasts to be persistent [6]. However, there has been tremendous progress in the ﬁeld of solar energy resource forecasting over the past decade. Hence, previous studies provide a conservative estimate of reserves. In this study, we seek to quantify the beneﬁts of state-of-art-solar solar forecasts for the EIM. The next section covers key design variables of EIMs and current solar forecasting methods that can be utilized for EIM participation and operation. 2.3. Market design variables The two fundamental concepts for energy imbalance markets are balance responsibility and imbalance settlements [7]. Balancing responsibility covers the processes from market opening, to bind- ing and market execution. The key variables for balance re- sponsibilities are: (1) program time unit (PTU), deﬁned as the time window for which bids are submitted and base schedules are awarded. (2) Scope of balancing, deﬁned as the magnitude of necessary generation change. (3) Gate closure time (GCTp/o); deﬁning the time when the option to submit or modify a bid ex- pires. The GCTp is for market participants while the GCTo is time when schedules are binded from the operator. (4) Types of imbal- ances, depending on if over- or under-generation occurs. (5) Closed (zero imbalance) or open (occurring imbalance) portfolio positions and (6) look ahead time (LAD), deﬁning the ahead time horizon considered for running the optimization to schedule awards. The design of imbalance settlements deﬁne the detailed setup of penalties associated with wrong forecasts and market bids. Details about imbalance settlements can be found in Ref. [7]. In general, it covers the frequency of settlements, regulations and pricing of imbalances for each market participant. The discussed variables allow for broadly varying market de- signs. The speciﬁc regulation of EIMs vary greatly for different world regions. For instance, in Norway, the ﬁrst GCT of market execution is 7 pm local time on the day before the market is executed. In Sweden, it is 4 pm and in Finland it is 4:30 pm. The PTU in these regions ranges between 60 and 15 min. In the Western Interconnection the ﬁrst GTC before market execution is 40 min and PTUs are 15 to 5 min. More details for European EIMs can be found in Ref. [7] and for the Western Interconnection, the in-depth details are provided below. The PTU and GCT are the key technical drivers of imbalance markets. 2.4. EIM in Western Interconnection The Western Interconnection Energy Imbalance Market (WI EIM) is a centralized and coordinated real-time energy market, operating at 15 and 5 min time intervals. Before the introduction of the WI EIM, resources were not shared between the participating BAAs. Each BA had to independently schedule operating reserves and backup resources. With the introduction of the WI EIM with over 30 participating BAAs, generation and demand can be A. Kaur et al. / Renewable Energy 86 (2016) 819e830820 exchanged between participating entities with CAISO oversight. Hence, imbalances can be corrected for within almost the full Western Interconnection. For instance, under-forecasts of genera- tion by wind in the Seattle area could be balanced with over- forecasts of power output from solar plants in the Mojave Desert. The following groups actively participate in the WI EIM: EIM entity (over 30 participating BAAs) represented by an entity scheduling coordinator (ESC), the market operator (CAISO), and participating resources represented by a scheduling coordinator. Non-Participating resources are also playing a role in the EIM since it was shown that the highest beneﬁts are achieved if all resources participate in the market [5]. 2.4.1. EIM WI market operation To determine the most economic dispatch, CAISO automatically accesses the following variables: generation and demand forecasts, outages, resource schedules, economic bids, dynamic contingencies and interchange schedules to run a multi-objective optimization for future planning and scheduling. The detailed time lines of WI EIM market operations are visualized in Fig. 1. The WI EIM process starts 7 days before the operating day, D. The ESC starts submitting the base schedules and can update the base schedule up to a day before the operating day i.e. D \u0001 1. On D \u0001 1, 10:00 am local time, ISO evaluates the base schedules to determine the energy balance, congestion and ﬂexible ramping capacity. This serves as an advisory information for the day-ahead market (DAM). At D \u0001 1, 1:00 pm local time, ISO runs the sufﬁciency test and provides the informa- tion to the scheduling coordinators. The base schedules and oper- ating bids from the scheduling operators are due 75 min before the operating hour i.e. Te75 min where T represents the start of the operating hour. At Te60 min, ISO runs the sufﬁciency test and publish results. Based on these results, the updated base schedules and energy bids are due by T\u000155 min. Again, a sufﬁciency test is run and results are published. The ﬁnal base schedules and the energy bids are due by Te40 min. The optimization for the 15 min energy market starts at Te37.5 min. Scheduling awards are published at Te22.5 min. The deadline for conﬁrmation between the generator and the market operator (referred to as e-tagging) is due at Te20 min. This process is repeated for every operating hour. Of all the timelines discussed above, Te75 min is crucial because by this time all interested market participants are required to submit their bids. The Te40 min horizon is the ﬁnal opportunity (GCTp) for the participants to update their bids based on the suf- ﬁciency test results. For the 5-min real-time dispatch market, the optimization is run at Te7.5 min interval and at Te2.5 min the resources are dispatched to balance the demand and generation for [T,T þ 5) min interval. This process is repeated for every 5 min time intervals. 2.5. Forecasting for EIMs The decisions for the market operations are based on forecasts. The optimization problem for the 15 min market looks ahead up to 4.5 h in 15 min time intervals. For the 5 min market, the optimi- zation looks ahead up to 65 min in 5 min intervals. These fore- casting horizons are of crucial importance for efﬁcient EIM market operation and management. Thus the timeline at which forecast is issued before GTCp/o and then applied by the vendor or market operator to bid into the market or award base schedules for the given PTU i.e. the interval of forecast highly inﬂuence the dynamics of the market. To account for all these factors and provide a clear distinction we deﬁne three parameters for the forecasts: forecast horizon (fh), forecast interval (ﬁ) and forecast resolution (fr). Lets assume that the market starts at t, then the forecast horizon is deﬁned as the amount of time before t the forecast needs to be issued, forecast interval is deﬁned as the time range for up to which the forecast is issued i.e [t,t þ ﬁ) and lastly, the forecast resolution fr denotes the frequency at which the forecasts are issued. The technical details of a forecast issued will be denoted as fh/ﬁfr. For instance 15/105 in minutes implies that forecast is issued at te15 min for time interval [t,t þ 10) minutes and the resolution of forecasts is 5 min i.e. two forecast {[t,t þ 5), [t þ 5,t þ 10)} in minutes are issued. In this study we focus on fh ¼ 24 h,75 \u0001 5 min, ﬁ,fr ¼ 1 h, 15 and 5 min.

To be able to participate in EIM, all the participants are required to provide their resource and load forecasts to the ISO. Since, EIM is designed to balance demand and resource at shorter time scales, in this study we focus on variable energy resource i.e. solar energy that is likely to play an important role in EIM at high penetration levels. A brief review on current state of art of solar forecasting is provided in the following section. 2.5.1. Solar forecasting Depending on the forecast horizon, different methods are applied for solar forecasting. For intra-week forecasts, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are known to generate good results. This usually holds true for horizons greater than 4 h. For intra-day forecasts below 4 h, mostly satellite image based pre- diction methods are used [11]. For intra-hour forecasts, local sky conditions and sky images are utilized along with other available meteorological data for the site [12e20]. Furthermore, the forecast models with no external inputs are also suggested [21] for solar power for intra-hour forecasts where information is derived from the various characteristics in the time-series. Also, forecast models are suggested that selects inputs based on spatial and temporal distributions [22]. A detailed review on solar forecasting method- ologies can be found in Ref. [23]. 3. Data sets 3.1. NWP data Day-ahead Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) forecasts gener- ated at the 00:00 coordinated universal time (UTC) are downloaded from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) servers for December 2012 to December 2013 and degribed for Folsom, CA. This forecast is generated with the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) based on the North American Model (NAM). Forecast horizons ranging from 9 to 35 h with hourly time- resolution are used. The performance of the NAM model is exten- sively evaluated. A general over-prediction of GHI is well known [24e26]. A reforecasting technique is applied on the GHI time- series forecast to remove the bias and structured errors. To eval- uate the model performance, the data set is divided into three disjoint data sets: training set (12-20-2012 to 1-15-2013), valida- tion set (1-16-2013 to 1-31-2013) and the test set (2-1-2013 to 12- 31-2014). The training set is used to train the models, the validation set is used for optimization as well as for feature selection for the forecast model. The test set is always kept as an independent set to access the model performance and report results. 3.2. Ground data GHI and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) data were collected at Folsom, CA, (located at 38.63\u0004N and 121.14\u0004W) using a rotating shadow-band radiometer (RSR). A CR1000 data logger from Campbell Scientiﬁc running on a 1 min sampling rate was used to store the data. The sensor of the RSR is a Licor-200SZ photodiode, periodically shaded to provide diffuse irradiance values. DNI values are calculated from GHI and diffuse irradiance values, with a pro- gram embedded in the data logger. Sky imagery was acquired with an off-the-shelf ﬁsh-eye lens security camera (Vivotek, model FE8171V) ﬁxed on a horizontal surface and pointed to the zenith, providing one picture every minute. The total costs for the deployed instruments are below $10,000 USD. The data sets of irradiance and sky imagery cover December 2012 to December 2013. 3.2.1. Data preprocessing The collected ground data and sky images are pre-processed to represent 5 and 15 min averages. Irradiance time-series and images are time-matched and divided into three disjoint data sets: training, validation and testing set as discussed above. In this case, each data set contains subsets of all available months to capture the full seasonal variation and various sky conditions. 3.2.2. Feature deﬁnitions Using the time-series and the sky images, features are calculated to be used an input for the forecast models. To calculate the fea- tures, the clearness index for GHI and DNI is deﬁned as kt ¼ GHI GHIcs and kb ¼ DNI DNIcs. The computed features include entropy, backward averages, and variability for both kt and kb. Entropy is deﬁned as, Ei ¼\u0001 Xn j¼1;pijs0 pijlog2\u0002pij\u0003; i ¼ð1; 2; …; 24Þ (1) where pij is the relative frequency for the jth bin out of the 200 bins in the range [0,2] for data in the interval [t \u0001 id,t] and d ¼ 5 min is the minimum window size. The index i ranges from 1 to 24, indi- cating the smallest window is 5 min and the largest is 120 min. Backward averages are deﬁned as, BiðtÞ¼ 1 N X t2½t\u0001id;t\u0005 ktðtÞ; i ¼ð1; 2; …; 24Þ (2) where N is the number of data points in the interval [t \u0001 idt, t]. Variability is deﬁned as: ViðtÞ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 N X t2½t\u0001id;t\u0005 DktðtÞ2 v u u t ; i ¼ð1; 2; …; 24Þ (3) where Dkt(t) ¼ kt(t) \u0001 kt(t \u0001 dt). The imagery features include entropy, mean, and standard de- viation for blue channel, green channel, red channel, red/blue ratio, and normalized red/blue ratio. All imagery features have minimum window sizes of 1 min, maximum window sizes of 10 min, window increments of 1 min, and feature length of 24. More details can be found in Ref. [27]. 3.3. Solar power modeling The PVwatts tool, available from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), is applied to get solar data for 1 MW ﬁxed, (open rack) array, commercial solar plant for the same location as the irradiance data sets. The characteristics chosen for the power plant are: array tilt ¼ 20\u0004, array azimuth ¼ 180\u0004, and system losses ¼ 14%. The data provided by this software is hourly data. A model is derived between the solar power produced and GHI to be able to work with a higher temporal resolution. The data sets generated by PVwatts are divided into two disjoint data sets. One data set is used to derive the curve ﬁt for the model, whereas the second data set is used to test the goodness of ﬁt. The model ﬁt m is computed as a function of ground GHI and day of the year (DOY) i.e. m ¼ f(GHI,DOY). DOY is used to account for the seasonal variations. The ﬁt was calculated using polynomial ﬁtting with degree 6. The results obtained using the ﬁt function are given in Table 1. Results show that the coefﬁcient of determination is 1, with very low MBE and RMSE. This means that all the ramps in solar power are captured by the model ﬁt. The derived ﬁt is used to model solar power P for the given location, which is then used in the analysis to draw conclusions from the perspective of a solar A. Kaur et al. / Renewable Energy 86 (2016) 819e830822 power producers. The solar power forecast P^ is computed as bP ¼ f ð dGHI; DOYÞ. 4. Forecast methods 4.1. Persistence The persistence model is used as the basic reference model. It is based on the assumption that the current conditions will persist so that, bI pðt þ fhÞ¼ IðtÞ; (4) where I^p(t) represents a GHI prediction from the persistence model, fh represents the forecast horizon, and I(t) is the measured GHI value at time t. 4.2. Smart persistence The smart persistence model is based on the same assumption as persistence model but it corrects for the deterministic diurnal variation in solar irradiance. It is deﬁned as, bI spðt þ fhÞ¼ ktðtÞ\u0006ICSðt þ fhÞ; (5) where I^sp(t) represents a GHI prediction, and ICS represents the estimated clear sky solar irradiance [28e30]. 4.3. Support vector regression Support vector regression is a machine learning technique [31,32]. Using a set of training inputs U, the objective is to ﬁnd a function f(u) using weights w that has 2 deviation from the actu- ally obtained targets kt f ðuÞ¼ 〈w; u〉 þ b with w2U; b2ℝ: (6) In this study, time-series formulation is applied kt(t) ¼ f(u(t)). To select the inputs and parameters for SVR model, Genetic Algo- rithms are applied. Hence, this method is referred to as SVR-GA. Genetic algorithm is solution space search technique inspired in natural-selection and the survival of the ﬁttest [33,34]. The algo- rithm starts with a population of individuals that encodes the pa- rameters that determine an individual layout in the population. In this work the parameters consist of binary values that control the inclusion/exclusion of the various input variables, and real values that determined the SVR parameters. The MSE between the measured values and the forecasted values is used as the ﬁtness of the GA individual. The GA optimizes these parameters by evolving an initial population based on the selection, crossover and mutation operators with the objective to minimize the MSE fore- cast error. 4.4. Reforecast The reforecast model proposed for reﬁning day-ahead load prediction by correcting for structured errors and bias in the fore- cast is applied here [35]. We apply the auto-regressive (AR) model which is a linear, time-series regression model. Using this model, the output can be expressed as a linear combination of past outputs and measured values, AðqÞIrðtÞ¼ BðqÞINAMðt \u0001 nkÞðtÞþ eðtÞ (7) where qN is the shift operator, q±N ¼ I(t ± N), A(q) that represents the combination of past values of output using coefﬁcients, a1,a2,/,ana, A(q) ¼ 1 þ a1q\u00011þ/þanaq\u0001na, B(q) ¼ b1þ/þbnbq\u0001nbþ1 and nk is time delay parameter. The part of the time-series not modeled is represented as e(t). For more details refer to [36]. In this study, the external input INAM(t) consists of GHI forecast values predicted by NAM. 5. Forecast results The results obtained using the test set are reported and dis- cussed (Table 2). The statistical metrics used to compare the fore- cast results are: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), relative RMSE (rRMSE), standard deviation (s), coefﬁcient of determination (R2) and fore- cast skill (s). MAE provides the mean of the absolute forecast error, MBE gives information about the bias in forecast error (Measured e Forecast). A negative MBE error indicates over prediction whereas positive MBE indicates under-prediction. RMSE gives information about the spread of the forecast errors, rRMSE is the RMSE normalized by mean annual GHI, and R2 shows the relation be- tween actual and forecast value. For a perfect forecast R2 ¼ 1. Forecast skill is a measure to compare the performance of the proposed model against the benchmark model [37]. 5.1. Intra-week forecast (day-ahead) For the day-ahead reforecast model, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was applied to select the number of lagged inputs for the model and na ¼ nb ¼ nk ¼ 1 were selected as the model pa- rameters. Using the NAM forecast issued at 00:00 UTC as an input and actual hourly GHI measured at ground, the day-ahead forecasts are issued at midnight for the following day. As stated above, the NAM model tends to over-predict irradi- ance. For the chosen location, the performance of the NAM model is even lower than that of the smart persistence model. To correct for this bias, a reforecast model was applied (see Fig. 2). The reforecast model corrects the bias by learning from continuous, structured errors, occurring in the forecast. After applying the reforecast, the bias was reduced by 67.21% and the deviation in forecast errors was reduced from 151.72 Wm\u00012 to 78.91 Wm\u00012. The distribution of forecast errors for the hours of day are shown in Fig. 3. An analysis of errors reveals that the NWP tends to Table 1 Statistical error metrics for GHI to PV output modeling for 1 MWp capacity ﬁxed- array PV plant.

Kaur et al. / Renewable Energy 86 (2016) 819e830 823 overestimated GHI before noon and underestimates the GHI after 14:00 PST. After the application of the reforecast model, this bias is reduced. The magnitude of bias in reforecast errors remains un- changed over the day except for sunrise and sunset times. This consistent error can be accounted for during market operations and reserve allocation. 5.2. Intra-hour forecast The intra-hour forecasts are implemented using a well known, open source machine learning library (LIBSVM) [38]. For intra-hour forecasts, the optimization is performed once for one step ahead prediction. The features and lag of the features selected by the GA are given in Table 3. General practice in forecasting is to propagate the 1 step ahead forecast into the forecast model as an input to forecast the next steps. Doing so, the errors in the forecasts are also propagated into next intervals and the forecasts become correlated. To avoid this correlation between various forecasts, the features selected by the GA are used to train the models speciﬁc for each forecast horizon and forecast interval. This ensures that each forecast is independent of each other and they can be studied independently. The persistence and smart persistence models are implemented according to Equations (4) and (5). 5.2.1. 15-minute Interval forecasts The forecasts in 15 min intervals are produced for forecast ho- rizon: 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 min. The statistics on the forecast errors are reported in Table 4. The trend in RMSE and standard deviation of the forecast errors for persistence, smart persistence and state of art forecast model is shown in Fig. 4. With increasing forecast ho- rizon, the RMSE and standard deviation increases linearly for the P model, whereas in case of SP and SVR-GA, after the forecast horizon of 45 min, the RMSE converges with small change in magnitude. The skill achieved by SVR-GA model, with respect to the P and SP models, ranges from 20.26 to 40.86% and 14.53e20.11% respectively. Fig. 2. Sample day of GHI forecast by NAM and reforecast model. The reforecast model corrects for the bias in the NAM forecast. If ramps are not predicted in NAM, it is unlikely that the reforecast model captures them. Both, NAM and reforecast model, tend to over predict. The bottom plot shows the reduction in absolute error. For clear days, the error is close to zero. Most high magnitude errors occur during overcast and cloudy conditions. Fig. 3. Mean and standard deviation of day-ahead forecast errors for GHI as a function of hour of the day. The NAM tends to over-predict until noon and then under-predicts later. The reforecast model corrects for the bias in the forecast and achieves consistent performance throughout the day.

The error statistics for all the forecast horizons are provided in Table 5. For the P model, the RMSE error increases from 40.43 to 173.61 Wm\u00012 as the forecast horizon in- creases from 5 to 75 min. The trend in error is linear. In case of SP, there is steep increase in RMSE from 5 to 20 min and afterwards the error magnitude starts converging and the increase in error is only 10 Wm\u00012 as the forecast horizon changes from 25 to 75 min. Similar patterns are observed in the results for SVR-GA. Further- more, the SP always underestimates GHI irrespective of the forecast horizon whereas the SVR-GA initially underestimates for 5e25 min forecast horizon. Afterwards, it overestimates GHI resulting in a negative bias. Using P as a reference model, the forecast skill achieved by SP and SVR ranges between 3.41 to 56.21% and 17.86e61.74% respec- tively. Comparing the rRMSE forecast errors to evaluate the per- formance of P and SP for 5e25 min forecast horizon, the improvements are marginal. As the forecast horizon starts to in- crease, the improvements start increasing linearly. There is clear beneﬁt in using smart persistence over persistence model and in using SVR-GA over smart persistence. A skill of 14.49% can be ex- pected using SVR-GA over SP. After a forecast horizon of 40 min, the improvements achieved by the forecast model are not consistent as the forecast age increases and ground imagery is not sufﬁcient enough to capture cloud dynamics outside this time horizon. For forecast horizon greater than 40 min, additional data such as sat- ellite imagery can be taken into account if higher accuracy is required. The cumulative frequency distribution (CDF) for the forecast errors is shown in Fig. 6. Using SP and SVR-GA reduce the spread in the forecast model. Comparing all the three models, there is 0.3e0.6 probability that error will be between ±1% for P, ±0.1% for SP and 0\u00010.2% for the forecast model. Since positive error means underestimation, there is excess of energy as compared to esti- mated. This kind of forecast is beneﬁcial for the market participant as they can curtail extra energy. More details about the value of these forecasts for real-time energy imbalance markets is discussed next. 6. Implications on EIMs 6.1.

RMSE and standard deviation for short-term GHI forecasts for the 15 min forecast interval with forecast horizon ranging from 15 to 75 min. With increasing forecast horizon, the standard deviation for the P model increases linearly. For the SP and SVR-GA model, the increase in RMSE and standard deviation is very small for the 45e75 min forecast horizon. Fig. 5. RMSE and standard deviation for short-term solar forecasts with horizons of 5e75 min in 5 min intervals. With increasing forecast horizon the error in Persistence (P) model increases linearly. The error is almost constant after a 25 min forecast horizon for the Smart Persistence (SP) and SVR-GA forecast model. A. Kaur et al. / Renewable Energy 86 (2016) 819e830 825 additional operating reserves to account for errors and any sudden changes in load. Reserve requirements also apply for EIMs and the costs for backup resources effect all market participants. There are various methods in practice to compute reserves [39,40,4]. The dominant approach is the n-sigma method, where reserves are calculated by assessing the standard deviation in generation and demand forecast. Based on the forecast above, we can quantify the required resources necessary to cover the uncertainty intro- duced into the EIM by solar generators with the P, SP and SVR-GA models. Fig. 7 shows the standard deviations and respective error reduction achieved by SP and SVR-GA model for 1 day and 75 to 5 min forecast horizons in the intervals of 1 h, 15 min and 5 min averages. As expected, the standard deviation for 15 min averages is lower than for 5 min averages. A 15 min market operation disre- gards large shares of variance occurring under 5 min market operation, suggesting that lower reserves have to be scheduled. This is counter intuitive but can be explained by the fact that temporal smoothing disregards large shares of variability (the so- lution is discussed further in Section 6.3). This shows that the dy- namics and operations of the market are highly inﬂuenced by the PTUs and GCTs. Depending on GCT, reserves are scheduled. For GCT >75 min, required relative reserve are deﬁned. For GCT <75 min, ﬂexibility reserves are scheduled. 6.2. EIMs with GCT greater than 75 min The scheduled relative reserve Rr for GCT >75 min is by deﬁni- tion a function of standard deviation of forecast errors s(e) occur- ring for a given PTU, normalized by the mean annual solar irradiance (GHI) received on a given location i.e., Rr ¼ sðeÞ GHI: (8) This approach enables to compare reserve required for different resource forecast approaches. In practice, the standard deviation of power forecast errors is considered (this requires knowledge of speciﬁc system characteristics). Resource forecasts directly trans- late into power forecasts which validates our use of relative reserve Table 5 Statistical error metrics for short-term solar irradiance forecast in 5-min intervals.

The color bar represents the CDF ranging from 0 to 1. The spread of errors in the P model is reduced by the SP and SVR-GA. For the 5 min forecast horizon, there is 0.4e0.6 probability that there will be ±1% error whereas with SP it is only ±0.1%. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) A. Kaur et al. / Renewable Energy 86 (2016) 819e830826 as an estimation for operating reserves. For large GCT, NWP pre- dictions have to be used for the resource forecast. As shown above, reforecasting signiﬁcantly enhances the performance of NWP based GHI prediction. Hence, required reserves can be signiﬁcantly reduced by the proposed reforecast method (see Section 4.4). Using the SP model the required reserve is 0.39. Using the NWP reforecast model it decreases to 0.32 which is a reduction of 17.84%. 6.3. EIMs with GCT less than 75 min For markets with GCT \u0007 75 min, the concept of ﬂexibility re- serves allocation is used. Flexibility reserves are scheduled as a function of change in standard deviation with respect to the magnitude of solar power production [6]. To show the comparison with GCT >75 min, relative reserves are also computed. As discussed above, to account for the problem of temporal smoothing the resolution of the forecast fr has to be considered i.e., for a given fr and ﬁ there will be n number of forecasts such that n ¼ fi fr. The forecast errors for all these n forecasts are represented as el such that l2{1,2,/,n}. Then, the standard deviation used to compute the relative reserve has to be greater than or equal to the maximum of standard deviation of el forecast errors, sðeÞfr \u0003 maxlðsðelÞÞ; (9) where s(e)fr is the standard deviation in n forecast errors occurring in a given PTU with a forecast resolution fr. For example, if the market operates on PTU ¼ 15 min, and the reserves allocated need to cover the variance up to 5 min time resolution, then n ¼ 3. Fig. 8 shows the relative reserves allocation for various forecast-horizons in 5 and 15 min intervals, considering the 5 min variance. The reduction of reserve required using P model compared to SP and SVR-GA is shown. The grey-scale bar represents the reserve allo- cation for 15 min interval. Colored bars represent the reserve allocation for the 5 min time interval. It is beneﬁcial for the market operator to allocate resources on shorter time horizons. For short- term forecast horizon (5e15 min), the reduction is smaller whereas for the higher forecast horizons, the beneﬁts of using SP and fore- cast model become apparent. The relative reserved can be reduced by 28.5% on average. For 45 min forecast horizon, the relative reserve required is 0.25 and it can be reduced by 40% using the SP model. 6.3.1. Market operator e schedulers The computed ﬂexibility reserves are shown in Fig. 9). The reduction of ﬂexibility reserves using the P model, compared to SP and SVR-GA are summarized in Table 6. Using the SP model the improvement ranges between 5.83% and 59.97% for the 5e75 min forecast horizon, respectively. The reductions using SVR-GA ranges between 22.62% and 67.47%, respectively. Using SVR-GA instead of SP, the ﬂexibility reserves can be reduced by 21%, on average. However, reductions are lower for the 15 min forecast intervals. This is expected because at 15 min resolution the resource vari- ability is lower than for 5 min. 6.3.2. Market participant e power generators The technical requirements of the power grid depend upon very small discrepancies between generation and load. This drives the need for imbalance settlements. For intermittent renewable gen- erators, FERC deﬁnes errors in market bids larger than 7.5% as a benchmark for penalties. Hence, we deﬁne errors larger than 7.5% as occurring imbalance. To quantify the likelihood that imbalances will occur, the probability of wrong bids through errors in forecasts for 5 min intervals for a 1 MW solar plant are calculated. For 5e75 min forecast, the probability ranges between 0.15 and 0.41, 0.08 to 0.17, and 0.07 to 0.14 for persistence, smart persistence and forecast model, respectively (see Fig. 10). Thus, the probability of imbalance can be reduced by 66.93% using SVR-GA instead of P (or 19.65% instead of SP model). Similar results are achieved for the 15 min forecast resolution, where the probability of an imbalance is reduced by 15.12% by replacing SP with SVR-GA. 6.4. Implications for the Western Interconnection EIM Most imbalance markets around the world are operated at 15 min or greater PTU, however the Energy Imbalance Market in the Western Interconnection is a unique platform where after a 15 min market, another 5 min market is operated. This section present results with respect to the timescales for Western Inter- connection from the perspective of both, the market operator and market participants. Let assume the market operator starts the optimization to execute the WI EIM at Te37.5 min to plan for the interval [T,T þ 15) using the state-of-the-art forecast issued at Te45 min. Then, in this time interval the forecast error lies between \u00010.8 and 0.09 k Wm\u00012 Fig. 7. Standard deviation in forecast error for forecast horizons ranging from 1 day to 5 min ahead forecast horizons in 1 h, 15 min and 5 min resolution. The total height of the bar represents the standard deviation in the P forecast errors and then the stacks within a bar shows the reduction in s by the SP and SVR-GA model. For the one day-ahead forecast, the standard deviation is the highest for the plain NAM forecast, followed by P model. The best performance is achieved by the reforecast model. This chart can be used for any solar forecast application study to design the modeling parameters for the uncertainty at various time-horizons. A. Kaur et al. / Renewable Energy 86 (2016) 819e830 827 for a 90% conﬁdence interval. Therefore, if another state-of-the art forecast for a forecast horizon of Te10 min is added to the system before the optimization runs for Te7.5 min, the uncertainity of over-prediction can be reduced from \u00010.6 to 0.04 kWm\u00012, repre- senting a 25% reduction and 41% overall reduction of variance (see Fig. 11). For WI EIM participation, market participants are mandated to submit a bid at Te75 min for the [T,T þ 15 min) time-interval. Using a forecast model instead of SP model, the chances of getting penalized reduces by 15.65%. Furthermore, if the bid is updated Te45 min, there is a 13.11% reduction in chances of getting penal- ized using SVR-GA as compared to the SP model. 7. Conclusions A review about energy imbalance markets is presented. The key design variables are explained and their signiﬁcance is discussed. It is shown that the program time unit as well as the gate closure time are the key variables controlling the market dynamics. The process of imbalance settlements are the key regulatory and economical drivers for market participants and the operator. The beneﬁts of solar resource and power forecasting are quan- tiﬁed in terms of reduction of required backup resources and the occurrence of energy imbalances. This analysis is based on day- ahead and short-term solar resource forecasts covering forecast horizons ranging from 1 day to 5 min in 1 h, 15 and 5 min intervals. State-of-the-art forecasts (with reforecast enhancements) are shown. The reforecast methodology reduces the bias in day-ahead forecast by 67.21% in NAM forecast and achieves a forecast skill of 14.5% over the smart persistence model. The error of the persis- tence model increases linearly, whereas smart persistence and the SVR-GA model, the error converges by forecast horizon of 25 min for 5 min resolution. The skill achieved by SVR-GA ranges between 14.53e20.11% and 12.64e16.75% for 15 min and 5 min forecast Fig. 8. Beneﬁts of 5 min versus 15 min reserve allocation for real-time markets considering 5 min data interval. The grey-scale bar plots shows the relative reserve required for the 15 min-time intervals whereas the colored bar represents the reserves required for the 5 min time-intervals. The total height of the bar represents the total reserve required using the persistence model and reduction in the magnitude of reserves is shown by the stacks within each bar. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Fig. 9. Flexibility reserve required for 1 MW solar plant for 5 min intervals. The total magnitude of the bar represents the ﬂexibility reserve needed using the Persistence model and the inner stack represents the magnitude reduction by Smart persistence and the forecast model. Beginning from forecast horizon of 5 mine55 min, the improvements in reducing ﬂexibility reserves increase and for the forecast horizons greater than 55 min, the improvements starts decreasing due to reduced forecast skill. A. Kaur et al. / Renewable Energy 86 (2016) 819e830828 intervals (forecast horizons ranging from 5 to 75 min). For forecasts, covering greater than or equal to 35 min forecast horizons, the skill drops implying that more sophisticated methods e.g. including satellite imagery are required in addition to ground data. The application of the discussed forecasts reduce the relative reserve requirement for participation in imbalance markets with day-ahead gate closure time by 17.84%. Similarly for EIMs with shorter gate closure time, the ﬂexibility reserves for an explanatory 1 MW solar plant can be reduced by 21% on average, for the 5 min forecast-intervals. For 15 min forecasts, the improvements are 16.14% compared to the smart persistence model. The improve- ments for the 15-min intervals are smaller than for 5 min intervals due to variability smoothing. For participating commercial solar producers, the probability of causing an imbalance is reduced by 19.65% and 15.12% for 5 min and 15 min forecast intervals. The improvements achieved through forecasting depend on market operation time scales. Having the ﬂexibility to operate on short time-horizons reduces reserve requirements and the probabilities of occurring imbalance settlements.
