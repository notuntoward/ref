Abstract The inability of the Gaussian copula to describe the tail dependence among risks has been sharply criticized since the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. In this paper, we extend the classic Gaussian copula to the distorted GAB copula with the distorted mix method. Similar with the Gaussian copula, the distorted GAB copula can be uniquely determined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas, which provides a great convenience for high-dimensional statistical estimations in practice, and at the same time, the distorted GAB copula is able to describe the tail dependence. Keywords: Gaussian copula, C A,B copula, Distorted mix method, Tail dependence. 1. Introduction Copulas are multivariate distributions with uniform [0, 1] marginal dis- tributions, which is a useful tool to characterize the dependence structure between random variables in high-dimensional statistics (Joe, 1997; Nelsen, 2006). In the area of ﬁnancial engineering, copulas have been widely used in modeling and minimizing tail risk and portfolio optimization; we refer interested readers to McNeil, Frey, and Embrechts (2005) and Denuit et al. (2005) for more details. 1.1. Motivation and literature review As is often the case that, existing copulas such as Gaussian copula, student-t copula, and Archimedean copula can hardly describe all superior Email address: rmish@nus.edu.sg (Hui Shao) Preprint submitted to Elsevier January 15, 2018 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 properties that are needed for a dependence modeling in practice. There- fore, combining several copulas with diﬀerent properties into one copula is a natural approach for constructing new copula families (Nelsen, 2006). Gaussian copula, which is derived from the multivariate normal distribu- tion, is one of the most fundamental and important copulas. Since Li (2000) applies it to the credit risk modeling, Gaussian copula has become more and more popular in practice. However, “the devil is in the tails”, which is the title of the paper by Donnelly and Embrechts (2010), Gaussian copula is sharply criticized for its lack of ability to describe the tail dependence after the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. Roughly speaking, the tail dependence of a pair of random variables is a measure of their comovements in the tails of the distributions. In risk management, the tail dependence implies that devas- tating losses in portfolios of risks as well as defaults of ﬁnancial enterprises in credit risk portfolios occur at the same time (Puccetti and R¨uschendorf, 2014; Wang and Wang, 2013). Therefore, quantifying the extent of tail de- pendence in bivariate random variables with dependence structure given by copula becomes critically important. The most popular tail dependence mea- sure is attributed to Joe (1997), in which the lower tail dependence measure is given by λL(C) = limu→0+ C(u, u)/u and none-zero of λL(C) means the ability to describe the lower tail dependence of the copula C. It is well-known that both the upper and lower tail dependence measure of the Gaussian cop- ula is zero, indicating its inability to the tail dependence. To modify the tail dependence of a copula, convex sum is one of the most direct methods. Speciﬁcally, if we want to modify the tail depen- dence of the Gaussian copula CΣ, the convex sum means a new copula C △ = αCΣ + (1 − α)C1, where α ∈ (0, 1) is the weight of the original Gaussian copula and C1 is another copula with the ability of tail dependence. Hence by the deﬁnition of the tail dependence measure (Joe, 1997), the choice of the copula C1 is decisive to the tail dependence behavior of the new copula C. Therefore, the problem comes to the choice of the copula C1 which is able to describe the tail dependence. The most commonly-used copulas with ability of tail dependence are Archimedean copulas, however, most of Archimedean copulas have few parameters and as a result of it, they show a lack of the ﬂexibility in high dimensional modelings. Notably, C A,B copula, proposed by Yang, Qi, and Wang (2009), could be an ideal choice for the copula C1. Ac- tually, C A,B copula can be regarded as a limiting case of the classic Gaussian copula, by noting the fact in bivariate case that limρ→1− Cρ(u, v) = M (u, v), 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 limρ→0 Cρ(u, v) = uv and limρ→−1+ Cρ(u, v) = W (u, v), where Cρ(u, v) is a bivariate Gaussian copula with correlation coeﬃcient ρ, M (u, v) is the comonotonic copula, uv is the independence copula, and W (u, v) is the coun- termonotonic copula. The most distinguished property of the C A,B copula is that, similar with the Gaussian copula, the C A,B copula can also be deter- mined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas1. More importantly, the C A,B copula has the ability of tail dependence, while the Gaussian copula does not have. Compared with other multivariate copulas with tail depen- dence such as student-t copula and Archimedean copula, C A,B shows more ﬂexibility and tractability. Hence in this paper, we choose the C A,B copula as C1 to modify the tail dependence of the classic Gaussian copula. Convex sum method is a useful tool to modify the tail dependence of a copula, but it is relatively simple in general. Based on the convex sum method, Li, Yuen, and Yang (2014) incorporates the conception of distortion function with it, proposing the distorted mix method (DMM) to construct new copula families. Comparing with the single convex method, DMM shows signiﬁcant improvement on the tail dependence modiﬁcation and also some other aspects (for example DMM allows the separate modelings the center part and the tail part (Li, Yuen, and Yang, 2014)). Therefore, this paper will adopt the DMM to construct the new copula families using the Gaussian copula and the C A,B copula. 1.2. Main contribution of this paper By using DMM, we deﬁne the Distorted GAB Copula based on the Gaus- sian copula and the C A,B copula (Deﬁnition 2.2). The properties of distorted GAB copula are well examined in this paper. In particular, ﬁrstly, the dis- torted GAB copula can be arbitrarily “close” to the Gaussian copula under a speciﬁed distance norm, which makes the statistical properties of the dis- torted GAB copula very similar with the classic Gaussian copula. Secondly, compared with the single Gaussian copula, the distortion GAB copula is able to describe the tail dependence. Thirdly, the distorted GAB copula can still be uniquely determined by all its marginal copulas, which provides a great convenience for high-dimensional statistical estimations. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the uniquely determination of the distorted GAB copula by all its two-dimensional 1Gaussian copula is uniquely determined by its correlation matrix which is then uniquely determined by all its two-dimensional marginal correlation coeﬃcients. 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 marginal copulas. Section 3 studies the tail dependence and the probability structure of the distorted GAB copula. Section 4 concludes the whole paper. 2. Distorted GAB copula: uniquely determination by all its two- dimensional marginal copulas In this section we will prove one of the most distinguished properties of the distortion GAB copula: uniquely determination by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas. 2.1. The model Before presenting the main results of this paper, we need some prelimi- naries. Deﬁnition 2.1. A function D(x) is called a distortion function if it is dif- ferentiable on (0, 1) and strictly increasing from [0, 1] → [0, 1] with D(0) = 0 and D(1) = 1. A distortion function D(u) is called trivial if D(u) = u for all u ∈ [0, 1]. Distorted mix method (DMM) is proposed by Li, Yuen, and Yang (2014), which allows us to construct new copula based on several existed copulas. For a given an integer m ≥ 2 and the corresponding weights αi > 0, i = 1, 2, · · · , m with ∑m i=1 αi = 1, let distortion functions Dij, i = 1, 2, · · · , m, j = 1, 2, · · · , n satisfy the following condition: m∑ i=1 αiDij(u) = u, for ∀ u ∈ [0, 1] and i = 1, 2, · · · , n, (1) then for any m copulas C1, C2, · · · , Cm, the function C deﬁned by C(u1, u2, · · · , un) = m∑ i=1 αiCi(Di1(u1), Di2(u2), · · · , Din(un)) (2) is a copula; we refer to Li, Yuen, and Yang (2014) for rigorous proofs. Using DMM, we are able to deﬁne the distorted GAB copula. Deﬁnition 2.2 (Distorted GAB copula). Let α ∈ (0, 1) and {Di, Ei}n i=1 be the distortion functions with αDi(u) + (1 − α)Ei(u) = u for ∀ u ∈ [0, 1] and 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 i = 1, 2, · · · , n, then C(u1, u2, . . . , un) = αCΣ(D1(u1), D2(u2), · · · , Dn(un)) + (1 − α)C A,B(E1(u1), E2(u2), . . . , En(un)) (3) is a copula, which will be called the Distorted GAB Copula throughout this paper. If all the distortion functions in Deﬁnition 2.2 are all trivial functions, then the distorted GAB copula reduces to C(u1, u2, . . . , un) = αCΣ(u1, u2, · · · , un) + (1 − α)C A,B(u1, u2, . . . , un), (4) which will be called the GAB. As we have introduced before, one of the most distinguished properties of the distorted GAB copula is its uniquely determination by all its two- dimensional marginal copulas. In the following, we will give proofs of this property in two separate cases: Σ = In and Σ ̸= In respectively, where Σ is the correlation matrix of the Gaussian copula CΣ and In is the unit matrix. 2.2. Uniquely determination: Σ ̸= In In this section we assume that the correlation matrix of the Gaussian copula in the distorted GAB copula is not equal to the unit matrix, i.e., Σ ̸= In. Then the following theorem indicates that the distorted GAB copula can be uniquely determined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas. Theorem 2.1 (Σ ̸= In). Suppose that the correlation matrix Σ = (ρij) in the distorted GAB copula is not equal to In, then the distorted GAB copula can be uniquely determined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas. Proof. See the appendix. GAB copula, as a special case of the distorted GAB copula, automatically satisﬁes the conclusion in Theorem 2.1. Corollary 2.1. Suppose that the correlation matrix Σ = (ρij) in the GAB copula is not equal to the unit matrix In, then the GAB copula can be uniquely determined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas. 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 Remark 1. The distorted GAB copula has a simple structure, which by deﬁ- nition is just a mixture of the Gaussian copula and the C A,B copula. However, it is somewhat surprising that, this simple constructed copula not only inher- its the common advantages of the Gaussian copula and the C A,B copulas (for example, both of them can be determined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas and both of them have a simple probability structure and easy for simulation), but also is able to describe the tail dependence, compared with the single Gaussian copula. Remark 2. More importantly, the distorted GAB copula can be arbitrarily “close” to the Gaussian copula CΣ provided the corresponding weight α → 1 −. More rigorously, for u = (u1, u2, · · · , un), we have ˆ [0,1]n |C(u) − CΣ(u)| du ≤ min {1, (1 − α)(n 2 + 1))} ; we refer to Li, Yuen, and Yang (2014). As a natural result, the distorted GAB copula (GAB copula) can be generally regarded as “same” as the Gaussian copula. In Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.1, we prove that the distorted GAB copula and the GAB copula with Σ ̸= In can be uniquely determined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas. For the case Σ ̸= In, we have similar but diﬀerent conclusions in the following sections. 2.3. Uniquely determination: Σ = In In this section we deal with the case that the correlation matrix Σ = In in the distorted GAB copula. A little bit diﬀerent with the case Σ ̸= In, the distorted GAB copula with Σ = In can not be determined by all its two- dimensional marginal copulas in general. Additional conditions are needed. Theorem 2.2 (Σ = In). Suppose that the correlation matrix Σ = (ρij) is equal to In and there exist at least two non-trivial distortion functions in the distorted GAB copula, then the distorted GAB copula can be uniquely determined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas. Proof. See the appendix. By the above theorem, we know that if the Gaussian copula reduces to the independence copula (Σ = In), then corresponding distorted GAB copula 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 may not be uniquely determined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas, hence an additional assumption (there are at least two non-trivial distortion functions) must be proposed for the property of the uniquely determination. Actually, from the proof of the above theorem we can see that, the additional assumption is only a suﬃcient condition for the unique determination, and as a result of it, the conclusion in Theorem 2.2 can not be applied to the GAB copula directly. Intuitively, just as we can imagine, the GAB copula with Σ = In can not be determined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas. Formally, we have the following proposition. Proposition 2.1. Suppose that the correlation matrix Σ in the GAB copula is equal to the unit matrix In, then it can not be uniquely determined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas. Proof. See the appendix. In the following two remarks, we will give explanations on why the GAB copula with Σ = In can not be uniquely determined by all its two-dimensional marginal copulas from two viewpoint: the intuitive one and the technical one. Remark 3. From intuitive viewpoint, direct calculations show that all the two-dimensional marginal copulas of the GAB copula with Σ = In are Fr´echet copulas, which can be seen as a convex sum of a two-dimensional independent copula and a Fr´echet copula. Therefore, the situation is getting confusing under such a circumstance, since the weight of the independent copula in the Fr´echet copula is the sum of the weights of the Gaussian copula and C A,B copula, and it is impossible for us to tell how much weight is from the Gaussian copula and how much is from the C A,B copula. Remark 4. From technical viewpoint, the GAB copula is a special case of the distorted GAB copula when we take all the distortion functions to be trivial. Indeed, by the proof in the appendix we can see that, substituting Di(u) = Ei(u) = u into the equation (28) will lead to the numerator and denominator both equal to 0 for any (u, v) ∈ [0, 1] 2 (note that A(1, 1)uv = A(u, v)), hence the weight of the Gaussian copula can not be uniquely determined. 3. Tail dependence and probabilistic structure 3.1. Tail dependence of the distorted GAB copula As we have clariﬁed in the introduction section, despite the popularity of the Gaussian copula, it is not immune to the sharp criticize for its inability to 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 grasp the tail dependence among marginal risks. To this end, the distorted GAB copula is proposed in this paper. Compared with the single Gaussian copula, a signiﬁcant improvement of the distorted GAB copula is the ability for the tail dependence. Recall the deﬁnition of the tail dependence: if two uniform [0, 1] ran- dom variables U and V follow the copula C(u, v), then the lower and upper dependence coeﬃcients λL and λU are deﬁned as λL(C) = lim u→0+ P (U ≤ u | V ≤ u) = lim u→0+ C(u, u) u , λU (C) = lim u→0+ P (U ≥ 1 − u | V ≥ 1 − u) = lim u→0+ 2u − 1 + C(1 − u, 1 − u) u , respectively. Theorem 3.1. Suppose that the distortion functions in Deﬁnition 2.2 sat- isfy D1 = · · · = Dn = D and E1 = · · · = En = E, then tail dependence coeﬃcients can be calculated as λL(Cij) = (1 − α)αijE′(0+) and λU (Cij) = (1 − α)αij(2 − E′(1−)), where Cij is the (i, j)-dimensional marginal copula of the distorted GAB cop- ula for diﬀerent integers i, j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n} and αij = ai1aj1 + ai3aj3. A natural corollary of Theorem 3.1 follows. Corollary 3.1. Tail dependence coeﬃcients of the GAB copula can be cal- culated as λL(Cij) = λU (Cij) = (1 − α)(ai1aj1 + ai3aj3), where Cij is the two-dimensional marginal copula of the GAB copula for diﬀerent integers i, j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n}. 3.2. Probability structure of the distorted GAB copula The probability structure of an n-dimensional copula C means n uniform [0, 1] random variables U1, U2, · · · , Un satisfying (U1, U2, · · · , Un) ∼ C. Theorem 3.2. Let uniform [0, 1] random variables {Ui, Vi}n i=1 and two cop- ulas C1 and C2 satisfy (U1, U2, · · · , Un) ∼ C1 and (V1, V2, · · · , Vn) ∼ C2, then 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 for any α ∈ (0, 1) and distortion functions {Di, Ei} n i=1 satisfying (1), we have (F1, F2, · · · , Fn) ∼ αC1(D1(u1), D2(u2), · · · , Dn(un)) + (1 − α)C2(E1(u1), E2(u2), · · · , En(un)), where Fi = ID−1 i (Ui) + (1 − I)E−1 i (Vi) for i = 1, 2, · · · , n and I is a random variable independent of {Ui, Vi} n i=1 with P(I = 1) = α and P(I = 0) = 1 − α. Proof. Check it directly by deﬁnitions. If two copulas C1 and C2 both have probability structures, then by Theo- rem 3.2 the distorted mix copulas based on C1 and C2 also has a probability structure. Therefore, identifying C1 and C2 by the Gaussian copula and C A,B copula respectively, we obtain the probability structure of the distorted GAB copula. With the explicit probability structure, we simulate the scatter plots of the distorted GAB copula. For simplicity, we only simulate the GAB cop- ula, which is without distortion functions; the distorted GAB copula can be simulated similarly. -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 Gaussian copula with standard normal marginals -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 GAB copula with standard normal marginals -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 Figure 1: The left ﬁgure is the scatter plot of bivariate Gaussian copula with standard normal marginals, in which the correlation coeﬃcient ρ = 0.60. The right ﬁgure is the scatter plot of bivariate GAB copula with standard normal marginals, where the correla- tion coeﬃcient ρ of the Gaussian copula is equal to 0.60; the coeﬃcients of C A,B copula are (a11, a12, a13) = (0.5, 0.1, 0.4), (a21, a22, a23) = (0.8, 0.1, 0.1), and the weight α = 0.50. It is observed in Figure 1 that, compared with the single Gaussian copula, GAB copula is able to describe the tail dependence, not only for the lower and upper tail direction but also for the left up and the right down tail direction. 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 Remark 5. By Theorem 3.2, the probability structure of the distorted GAB copula has explicit expressions and it can be applied to the valuation of the Basket Default Swaps (n-th to default CDS). More precisely, if we degen- erate the Gaussian copula component in the distorted GAB copula to the one-factor model (Hull and White (2004)), then the probability structure (U1, U2, · · · , Un) ∼ distortion GAB copula forms a general two-factor model (the ﬁrst common factor is from the one-factor model and the second com- mon factor is from the C A,B copula 2), which can be applied to the valuation of the basket default swaps with the multi-factor model proposed by Laurent and Gregory (2003). 4. Conclusions In this paper, we extend the classic Gaussian copula to the distorted GAB copula (GAB copula). The newly constructed families of copulas keep the advantages of the classic Gaussian copula, i.e., they can still be uniquely determined by its all two-dimensional copulas under proper conditions, and at the same time, they are able to describe the tail dependence. The probability structure of the distorted GAB copula is provided. References Denuit, M., Dhaene, J., Goovaerts, M., Kass, R., 2005. Actuarial theory for dependent risks: measures, orders and models.

Appendix Lemma 4.1 (Yang, Cheng, and Zhang (2006)). Each bivariate copula C(u, v) can be uniquely decomposed as a convex combination of a Fr´echet copula and 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 a indecomposable copula, i.e., for any bivariate copula C(u, v) we have the following decomposition: C(u, v) = αM (u, v) + βuv + γW (u, v) + lf (u, v), (5) in which coeﬃcients α, β, γ, l are uniquely determined by the given copula C(u, v), and the f (u, v) is an indecomposable copula. By Yang, Cheng, and Zhang (2006), the coeﬃcient α, β, γ, l can be calcu- lated directly by explicit formulas. For example, β = inf (u,v)∈[0,1]2 ∂2C(u,v) ∂u∂v . In particular, the bivariate Gaussian copula with correlation coeﬃcient ρ ̸= 0 is indecomposable. Namely, for σ ̸= 0, we have αCσ = βCσ = γCσ = 0 and lCσ = 1, in which Cσ is a bivariate Gaussian copula. The second lemma deals with the decomposition of probability measures. Lemma 4.2 (Nelsen (2006)). For any bivariate copula C, we can always decompose it into a sum of an absolutely continuous item A and a singular item S uniquely. C(u, v) = A(u, v) + S(u, v), where A(u, v) = ˆ u 0 ˆ v 0 ∂2C(s, t) ∂s∂t ds dt and S(u, v) = C(u, v) − A(u, v). For a general theory of the measure decomposition, we refer to Halmos (1974). Proof of Theorem 2.1 Proof. The objective of this poof is to determine Σ, α, {aij}, Di(u) and Ei(u) for i = 1, 2, · · · , n, j = 1, 2, 3, in the distorted GAB copula from all its two-dimensional marginal copulas Cij(u, v) for i ̸= j, Cij(u, v) := C(1, . . . , u, . . . , v, . . . , 1) = aCρij (Di(u), Dj(v)) + bM (Ei(u), Ej(v)) + cEi(u)Ej(v) + dW (Ei(u), Ej(v)), (6) in which a = α, b = (1 − α)(ai1aj1 + ai3aj3), d = (1 − α)(ai1aj3 + ai3aj1) and c = 1 − a − b − d. 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 By lemma 4.1, any bivariate copula can be decomposed as a convex sum of a Fr´echet copula and a indecomposable copula, apply it to Cij(u, v) we have for i ̸= j, aCρij (Di(u), Dj(v)) + bM (Ei(u), Ej(v)) + cEi(u)Ej(v) + dW (Ei(u), Ej(v)) = lf (u, v) + αM (u, v) + βuv + γW (u, v), (7) where l, α, β, γ and copula f (u, v) can be determined by lemma 4.1. Since f (u, v) is a indecomposable copula, by lemma 4.2 we can decompose it into a sum of a absolutely item and a singular item, f (u, v) = A(u, v) + S(u, v), where A(u, v) denotes the absolutely item and S(u, v) denotes the singular item. Substitute f (u, v) with A(u, v) and S(u, v) into (7) we have aCρij (Di(u), Dj(v)) + bM (Ei(u), Ej(v)) + cEi(u)Ej(v) + dW (Ei(u), Ej(v)) = lA(u, v) + lS(u, v) + αM (u, v) + βuv + γW (u, v). (8) Note that absolutely continuous items in (8) are Cρij (Di(u), Dj(v)), Ei(u)Ej(v), A(u, v) and uv; singular items are M (Ei(u), Ej(v)), W (Ei(u), Ej(v)), S(u, v), M (u, v) and W (u, v). By Lemma 4.2, we know that the decomposition into the absolutely continuous item and the singular item is unique, then for ∀ 0 ≤ u ≤ 1, 0 ≤ v ≤ 1, bM (Ei(u), Ej(v))+dW (Ei(u), Ej(v)) = αM (u, v)+γW (u, v)+lS(u, v), (9) and aCρij (Di(u), Dj(v)) + cEi(u)Ej(v) = βuv + lA(u, v). (10) Let v = 1 in (9) (b + d)Ei(u) = αu + γu + lS(u, 1), for ∀ u ∈ [0, 1]. Let u = v = 1 in (9) b + d = α + γ + lS(1, 1). (11) 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 then for ∀ u ∈ [0, 1], we have Ei(u) = (α + γ)u + lS(u, 1) α + γ + lS(1, 1) . In the following we will determine b and d respectively. Since distortion functions Ei(u) and Ej(u) are continuous, there always exists a pair of posi- tive numbers (u0, v0) being suﬃciently small such that W (Ei(u0), Ej(v0)) = 0 and W (u0, v0) = 0, substitute (u0, v0) into (9), bM (Ei(u0), Ej(v0)) = αM (u0, v0) + lS(u0, v0), then b = αM (u0, v0) + lS(u0, v0) M (Ei(u0), Ej(v0)) . (12) Substitute (26) into (11), we have d = α + γ + lS(1, 1) − αM (u0, v0) + γW (u0, v0) M (Ei(u0), Ej(v0)) . Up to now b, d and {Ei(u)}n i=1 have been determined from two-dimensional marginal copulas of the distorted GAB copula. Next we will determine the remaining a, c and {Di(u)} n i=1 in absolutely continuous items. Let u = v = 1 in (10), a + c = β + lA(1, 1), (13) together with aDi(u) + (1 − a)Ei(u) = u, ∀ u ∈ [0, 1], i = 1, 2, . . . , n, we have Di(u) = u − (1 − a)Ei(u) a , (14) take the inverse E−1 i (u) into u, then for ∀ u ∈ [0, 1], Di(E−1 i (u)) = E−1 i (u) − (1 − a)u a , (15) substitute u with E−1 i (u) and v with E−1 j (v) in (10), then for ∀ 0 ≤ u ≤ 1, 0 ≤ v ≤ 1 we have 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 aCρij (Di(E−1 i (u)), Dj(E−1 j (v))) + cuv = βE−1 i (u)E−1 j (v) + lA(E−1 i (u), E−1 j (v)), (16) taking ∂2 ∂u∂v for both sides of (16) yields a ∂2 ∂u∂v Cρij (Di(E−1 i (u)), Dj(E−1 j (v))) + c = β dE−1 i (u) du dE−1 j (u) du + l ∂2 ∂u∂v A(E−1 i (u), E−1 j (v)), (17) apply the chain rule to Cρij (Di(E−1 i (u)), Dj(E−1 j (v))) we have ∂2 ∂u∂v Cρij (Di(E−1 i (u)), Dj(E−1 j (v))) = ∂Di(E−1 i (u)) ∂u ∂Dj(E−1 j (v)) ∂v × cρij (Di(E−1 i (u)), Dj(E−1 j (v))), where cρ(x, y) = 1 2π√ 1−ρ2 e x2+y2−2ρxy 2(1−ρ2) is the density function of the Gaussian copula. It is easily veriﬁed that lim u→1−,v→0+ cρij (Di(E−1 i (u)), Dj(E−1 j (v))) = 0, noting that ∂Di(E−1 i (u)) ∂u > 0 and ∂Dj (E−1 j (v)) ∂v > 0 we have inf (u,v)∈[0,1]2 ∂2 ∂u∂v Cρij (Di(E−1 i (u)), Dj(E−1 j (v))) = 0, now (17) turns into c = inf (u,v)∈[0,1]2(β ∂E−1 i (u) ∂u ∂E−1 j (v) ∂v + l ∂2A(E−1 i (u), E−1 j (v)) ∂u∂v ). (18) Now c is determined by (18) and then a = β + lA(1, 1) − c is deter- mined by (13). By (14) we obtain the explicit form of Di(u) .Therefore, {Di(u), Ei(u)}n i=1 and the weights a, b, c, d have all been determined all by two-dimensional marginal copulas. The proof is completed. 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 Proof of Theorem 2.2 Proof. The objective of this poof is to determine Σ, α, {aij}, Di(u) and Ei(u) for i = 1, 2, · · · , n, j = 1, 2, 3, in the distorted GAB copula from all its two-dimensional marginal copulas Cij(u, v) for i ̸= j, Cij(u, v) := C(1, . . . , u, . . . , v, . . . , 1) = aDi(ui)Dj(uj) + bM (Ei(ui), Ej(uj)) + cEi(ui)Ej(uj) + dW (Ei(ui), Ej(uj)), (19) in which a = α, b = (1 − α)(ai1aj1 + ai3aj3), d = (1 − α)(ai1aj3 + ai3aj1) and c = 1 − a − b − d. Apply lemma 4.2 to Cij(u, v) for i ̸= j we have aDi(u)Dj(v) + bM (Ei(u), Ej(v)) + cEi(u)Ej(v) + dW (Ei(u), Ej(v)) = lf (u, v) + αM (u, v) + βuv + γW (u, v), (20) where l, α, β, γ can be calculated by lemma 4.1. By lemma 4.2 the indecomposable copula f (u, v) can be decomposed into a convex sum of a absolutely item and a singular item, i.e., f (u, v) = A(u, v) + S(u, v), where A(u, v) denotes the absolutely item and S(u, v) denotes the singular item. Substitute f (u, v) with A(u, v) and S(u, v) into (20) we have aDi(u)Dj(v) + bM (Ei(u), Ej(v)) + cEi(u)Ej(v) + dW (Ei(u), Ej(v)) = lA(u, v) + lS(u, v) + αM (u, v) + βuv + γW (u, v). (21) Note that absolutely continuous items in (21) are Di(u)Dj(v), Ei(u)Ej(v), A(u, v) and uv; singular items are M (Ei(u), Ej(v)), W (Ei(u), Ej(v)), S(u, v), M (u, v) and W (u, v), thus by Lemma 4.2 we know that the decomposition into the absolutely continuous and the singular item is unique, namely, for ∀ 0 ≤ u ≤ 1, 0 ≤ v ≤ 1, bM (Ei(u), Ej(v)) + dW (Ei(u), Ej(v)) = αM (u, v) + γW (u, v) + lS(u, v), (22) 16 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 and aDi(u)Dj(v) + cEi(u)Ej(v) = βuv + lA(u, v). (23) Let v = 1 in (22) (b + d)Ei(u) = αu + γu + lS(u, 1), for ∀ u ∈ [0, 1], (24) let u = v = 1 in (22) b + d = α + γ + lS(1, 1), (25) then for ∀ u ∈ [0, 1], we have Ei(u) = (α + γ)u + lS(u, 1) α + γ + lS(1, 1) . In the following we will determine b, d respectively. Let (u0, v0) be a pair of positive numbers that is suﬃciently small such that W (Ei(u0), Ej(v0)) = 0 and W (u0, v0) = 0, substitute (u0, v0) into (22), bM (Ei(u0), Ej(v0)) = αM (u0, v0) + lS(u0, v0), then b = αM (u0, v0) + lS(u0, v0) M (Ei(u0), Ej(v0)) . (26) Substitute (26) into (25), we have d = α + γ + lS(1, 1) − αM (u0, v0) + γW (u0, v0) M (Ei(u0), Ej(v0)) . Up to now b, d and {Ei(u)}n i=1 have been determined, next we will deter- mine the remaining a, c and {Di(u)}n i=1 in absolutely items. Let u = v = 1 in (23), a + c = β + lA(1, 1), since aDi(u) + (1 − a)Ei(u) = u, ∀ u ∈ [0, 1], i = 1, 2, · · · , n, we have Di(u) = u − (1 − a)Ei(u) a . (27) 17 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 Substituting (27) into (23) yields (u − (1 − a)Ei(u))(v − (1 − a)Ej(v)) a + cEi(u)Ej(v) = βuv + lA(u, v), solute above equation for a we obtain a = (Ei(u) − u)(v − Ej(v)) Ei(u)v + Ej(v)u + (β + lA(1, 1) − 2)Ei(u)Ej(v) − βuv − lA(u, v). (28) Since there exist at least two nontrivial distortion functions, thus there exist i ̸= j and (u0, v0) such that the denominator of the right side in (28) not equals to zero, hence a equals to (Ei(u0) − u0)(v0 − Ej(v0)) Ei(u0)v0 + Ej(v0)u0 + (β + lA(1, 1) − 2)Ei(u0)Ej(v0) − βu0v0 − lA(u0, v0)) , and then c = β + lA(1, 1) − a. By (27) distortion functions {Di(u)}n i=1 have also been determined, the proof ends here. Proof of the Counterexample Proof. Since Σ = In, we have ρij = 0 for all i ̸= j. By deﬁnition, the two-dimensional marginal copula of GAB copula takes the following form, Cij(u, v) = aΠ(u, v) + (1 − a)(αijM (u, v) + βijΠ(u, v) + γijW (u, v)) = (1 − a)αijM (u, v) + (a + (1 − a)βij)Π(u, v) + (1 − a)γijW (u, v) = Cij(u, v) = ˜αijM (u, v) + ˜βijΠ(u, v) + ˜γijW (u, v), we have ˜βij > 0, for all i ̸= j, since ˜βij is the sum of the coeﬃcient of the Gaussian copula and the C A,B part. Let x ∈ (0, mini̸=j ˜βij) and we can reformulate the above Cij(u, v) as xuv + (1 − x)( ˜αij 1 − xM (u, v) + ˜βij − x 1 − x Π(u, v) + ˜γij 1 − x W (u, v)). (29) 18 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 Therefore, the coeﬃcients of the Fr´echet copula in (29) is as follows, { ˜αij 1 − x : ∀i ̸= j} , { ˜βij − x 1 − x : ∀i ̸= j } , { ˜γij 1 − x : ∀i ̸= j} . (30) We claim that there is a x0 ∈ (0, mini̸=j βij) such that the coeﬃcients (30) satisfy the C A,B decomposable condition (Yang, Cheng, and Zhang, 2006) from the fact that the mixture copula given in the theorem does contain a component of the C A,B copula. Thus, there exist non-negative constants aij, i ≤ n, j = 1, 2, 3 satisfying Σ3 j=1aij = 1, i ≤ n, such that for each 1 ≤ i < m ≤ n, the following equations hold, ˜αij 1 − x0 = ai1aj1 + ai3aj3, (31) ˜γij 1 − x0 = ai1aj3 + ai3aj1, (32) ˜βij − x0 1 − x0 = 1 − ˜αij 1 − x0 − ˜γij 1 − x0 . (33) At this moment the GAB copula turns into C(u1, u2, ..., un) = x0u1u2 . . . un + (1 − x0) 3∑ j1=1 3∑ j2=1 ... 3∑ jn=1 ( n∏ i=1 aiji)W (min ji=1(ui), min ji=3(ui)) ∏ ji=2 ui, however, when the value of x is changed. For example, let x1 ∈ (0, mini̸=j βij) and x1 < x0. For this choice of x, we can reformulate the two-dimensional marginal copula Cij(u, v) into x1Π(u, v) + (1 − x1)( ˜αij 1 − x1 M (u, v) + ˜βij − x1 1 − x1 Π(u, v) + ˜γij 1 − x1 W (u, v)), by (31), (32) and (33) we have ˜αij 1 − x1 = ( √1 − x0 1 − x1 ai1)( √ 1 − x0 1 − x1 aj1) + (√1 − x0 1 − x1 ai3)( √ 1 − x0 1 − x1 aj3), 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293 ˜γij 1 − x1 = ( √1 − x0 1 − x1 ai1)( √ 1 − x0 1 − x1 aj3) + (√1 − x0 1 − x1 ai3)( √ 1 − x0 1 − x1 aj1), ˜βij − x1 1 − x1 = 1 − ˜αij 1 − x1 − ˜γij 1 − x1 . Now, the coeﬃcients of the Fr´echet copula in (29) are { ˜αij 1 − x1 : ∀i ̸= j} , { ˜βij − x1 1 − x1 : ∀i ̸= j } , { ˜γij 1 − x1 : ∀i ̸= j} , which also satisfy the C A,B decomposable condition. Therefore, In this case we can get another GAB copula as C1(u1, u2, . . . un) = x1u1u2 . . . un+(1−x1) 3∑ j1=1 3∑ j2=1 ... 3∑ jn=1 (Πn i=1 √ 1 − x0 1 − x1 aiji)W (min ji=1(ui), min ji=3(ui))Πji=2ui, obviously, C(u1, u2, . . . , un) ̸≡ C1(u1, u2, . . . , un). Therefore, we obtain the conclusion that the two-dimensional marginal copula functions cannot uniquely determine a joint C A,B copula, which completes the proof. 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2956293","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
