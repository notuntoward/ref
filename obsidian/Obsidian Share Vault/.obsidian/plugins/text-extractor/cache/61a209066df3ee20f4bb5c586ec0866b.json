CAHPS® is a registered trademark of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Press Ganey (PG), a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) certified HEDIS® Survey Vendor, was selected by Coordinated Care to conduct its MY 2023 CAHPS® 5.1H Medicaid Adult Survey. NCQA requires health plans to submit CAHPS survey results in compliance with HEDIS® accreditation requirements. SURVEY OBJECTIVE The overall objective of the CAHPS® study is to capture accurate and complete information about consumer- reported experiences with health care. Specifically, the survey aims to measure how well plans are meeting their members’ expectations and goals; to determine which areas of service have the greatest effect on members’ overall satisfaction; and to identify areas of opportunity for improvement, which can aid plans in increasing the quality of provided care. 2024 NCQA CHANGES NCQA made changes to the survey or program for 2024. One question was deleted from the 2024 Commercial Adult Survey and the 2024 Medicaid Adult Survey: • Have you had either a flu shot or flu spray in the nose since July 1, 20XX? Your Project Manager is Julia Schneider (Julia.Schneider@pressganey.com).

The survey aims to measure how well MCPs are meeting their members’ expectations and goals; determine which areas of service have the greatest effect on members’ overall satisfaction; and identify areas of opportunity for improvement. Results of the survey provide consumers, purchasers, health plans, and state Medicaid programs with information about a broad range of key consumer issues. Data in this report was collected by Washington State MCO’s from members who participate in Apple Health. General findings: • Scores for the State of Washington tend to fall below National Averages, consistent with the other states in their Health and Human Services Region (HHS) Region 10 – Seattle (Alaska, Oregon, Idaho and Washington). • Getting Needed Care, Rating of Health Plan and Rating of Health Care fall into the lowest percentile threshold for all plans in the State. A comprehensive list of Key Measures comparing Apple Health plan performance with 2023 scores, Quality Compass Averages, and Regional Scores can be found in Appendix A. 6 PRESS GANEY RECOMMENDATIONS • Access remains at the top of the list for Key Drivers of Health Plan Satisfaction. Utilizing technology can help with access issues in rural areas • Consider running “Secret Shopper” access surveys to help identify where gaps may exist • Identifying and targeting high-risk members with a Case Manager can also be impactful • Collaborate with providers and share tools, resources, and best practices to support, or reinforce, a complete and effective information exchange with all patients • Visit the Press Ganey Resource Library for more information. 7 METHODOLOGY 8 METHODOLOGY ^ The survey for Wellpoint Washington (previously Amerigroup Washington) was administered by CCS. * Response rate is calculated using the following formula: Total completed surveys x 100 Total mailed - Total ineligible Initial Sample Size Undeliv- erables Total Ineligible Completed Surveys Spanish Completes Adjusted Response Rate* Total Mail Total Phone Total Internet Total Total Mail Phone Internet 2022 2023 2024 Washington Total 9923 NA 171 1050 567 278 205 56 26 21 9 11.9% 11.5% 10.8% Community Health Plan of Washington (CHPW) 2498 294 40 265 152 65 48 5 5 0 0 12.3% 12.4% 10.8% Coordinated Care of Washington (CCW) 1350 136 12 133 63 32 38 11 4 5 2 9.3% 10.5% 9.9% Molina Healthcare of Washington (MHW) 2295 202 38 233 121 75 37 5 2 2 1 13.1% 11.8% 10.3% UnitedHealthcare Community Plan (UHC) 1620 230 26 163 84 27 52 2 0 1 1 11.4% 11.0% 10.2% Wellpoint Washington (previously Amerigroup Washington) (WLP)^ 2160 NA 55 256 147 79 30 12 1 7 4 12.3% 11.2% 12.2% 9 QUALIFIED RESPONDENTS Included beneficiaries who were… • 18 years and older (as of December 31st of the measurement year) • Continuously enrolled in the plan for at least five of the last six months of the measurement year RESPONSE RATE TRENDING 2022 2023 2024 Completed SUBTOTAL 1158 1097 1050 Ineligible Does not Meet Eligibility Criteria (01) 79 80 105 Language Barrier (03) 19 22 36 Mentally/Physically Incapacitated (04) 16 15 21 Deceased (05) 11 6 9 SUBTOTAL 125 123 171 Non-response Break-off/Incomplete (02) 87 108 91 Refusal (06) 332 215 265 Maximum Attempts Made (07) 8140 8091 8328 Added to DNC List (08) 13 19 18 SUBTOTAL 8572 8433 8702 Total Sample 9855 9653 9923 Oversampling % 630.0% 615.0% 635.0% Response Rate 11.9% 11.5% 10.8% PG Response Rate 12.2% 11.5% 11.1% METHODOLOGY 2024 RESPONSE RATE CALCULATION 1050 (Completed) = 1050 = 10.8% 9923 (Sample) - 171 (Ineligible) 9752 DATA COLLECTION The MY 2023 Medicaid Adult version of the 5.1 CAHPS survey was administered via the following methodology: Washington Total First questionnaire mailed 〉 Second questionnaire mailed 〉 Initiate follow-up calls to non-responders 〉 Last day to accept completed surveys NA NA NA NA COMPLETES - MODALITY BY LANGUAGE Language Mail Phone Internet Internet Modes Total QR Code Email URL English 536 257 196 77 22 71 989 Spanish 26 21 9 3 1 1 56 Chinese 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 Total 567 278 205 80 23 72 1050 10 QUALIFIED RESPONDENTS Included beneficiaries who were… • 18 years and older (as of December 31st of the measurement year) • Continuously enrolled in the plan for at least five of the last six months of the measurement year RESPONSE RATE TRENDING 2022 2023 2024 Completed SUBTOTAL 327 306 265 Ineligible Does not Meet Eligibility Criteria (01) 19 25 14 Language Barrier (03) 8 7 19 Mentally/Physically Incapacitated (04) 0 4 2 Deceased (05) 4 1 5 SUBTOTAL 31 37 40 Non-response Break-off/Incomplete (02) 12 16 9 Refusal (06) 62 53 63 Maximum Attempts Made (07) 2268 2086 2121 Added to DNC List (08) 0 0 0 SUBTOTAL 2342 2155 2193 Total Sample 2700 2498 2498 Oversampling % 100% 85.0% 85.0% Response Rate 12.3% 12.4% 10.8% PG Response Rate 12.2% 11.5% 11.1% METHODOLOGY 2024 RESPONSE RATE CALCULATION 265 (Completed) = 265 = 10.8% 2498 (Sample) - 40 (Ineligible) 2458 DATA COLLECTION The MY 2023 Medicaid Adult version of the 5.1H CAHPS survey was administered via the following methodology: First questionnaire mailed 〉 Second questionnaire mailed 〉 Initiate follow-up calls to non-responders 〉 Last day to accept completed surveys 3/5/2024 4/9/2024 4/30/2024 - 5/14/2024 5/15/2024 COMPLETES - MODALITY BY LANGUAGE Language Mail Phone Internet Internet Modes Total QR Code Email URL English 128 59 47 20 0 27 234 Spanish 19 6 1 1 0 0 26 Chinese 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 Total 152 65 48 21 0 27 265 Total Number of Undeliverables: 294 Note: Respondents were given the option of completing the survey in English, Spanish, or Chinese.

The Summary Rates for Effectiveness of Care Measures are calculated on a two-year rolling average due to anticipated small denominators. Rating questions are typically displayed with two Summary Rates: Significance Testing All significance testing is performed at the 95% confidence level using a t-test. Small Denominator Threshold NCQA will assign a measure result of NA to overall ratings or composites with a denominator (i.e., the average number of responses across all questions used to calculate the composite) less than 100.

Overview The SatisActionTM key driver statistical model is a powerful, proprietary statistical methodology used to identify the key drivers of the rating of the health plan and provide actionable direction for satisfaction improvement programs. This methodology is the result of a number of years of development and testing using health care satisfaction data. We have been successfully using this approach since 1997. The model provides the following: • Identification of the elements that are important in driving of the rating of the health plan. • Measurement of the relative importance of each of these elements. • Measurement of how well members think the plan performed on those important elements. • Presentation of the importance/performance results in a matrix that provides clear direction for member satisfaction improvement efforts by the plan.LowerHigher Lower Higher RETAIN Items in this quadrant have a relatively small impact on the rating of the health plan but performance is above average. Simply maintain performance on these items. WAIT These items are somewhat less important than those that fall on the right side of the chart and, relatively speaking, performance is below average. Addressing these items can wait until more important items have been dealt with. POWER These items have a relatively large impact on the rating of the health plan and performance is above average. Promote and leverage strengths in this quadrant. OPPORTUNITY Items in this quadrant have a relatively large impact on the rating of the health plan but performance is below average. Focus resources on improving processes that underlie these items. 28 RETAIN POWER WAIT OPPORTUNITY SURVEY MEASURE 2023 2024 SRS %tile* SRS %tile* POWER None OPPORTUNITY ◼ Rating Q8 Rating of Health Care 44.5% 5th 49.3% 10th ◆ GCQ Q4 Getting urgent care 74.6% 8th 71.9% <5th ◆ GCQ Q6 Getting routine care 67.9% <5th 67.4% <5th ◼ Rating Q18 Rating of Personal Doctor 60.7% 7th 64.3% 14th ⚫ GNC Q9 Getting care, tests, or treatment 76.4% 8th 81.2% 18th ◼ Rating Q22 Rating of Specialist + 58.8% 8th 66.4% 34th ⚫ CS Q24 Provided information or help 78.3% 11th 79.0% 9th ⚫ GNC Q20 Getting specialist appointment 69.2% 6th 72.7% 15th WAIT ⚫ CS Q25 Treated with courtesy and respect 92.2% 18th 95.0% 49th ◆ HWDC Q13 Dr. listened carefully 91.3% 23rd 92.0% 25th ◆ HWDC Q14 Dr. showed respect 92.0% 9th 93.7% 30th ◆ HWDC Q15 Dr. spent enough time 89.9% 37th 88.2% 16th ◼ CC Q17 Coordination of Care + 79.4% 11th 80.7% 16th ◆ HWDC Q12 Dr. explained things 91.1% 24th 92.0% 32nd ⚫ CS Q27 Ease of Filling Out Forms + 94.8% 38th 94.7% 49th RETAIN None *Percentiles based on the PG Book of Business of the listed year.
