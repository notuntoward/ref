AP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for Fox News, PBS News Hour, The Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press. The survey of more than 120,000 voters was conducted for eight days, concluding as polls closed. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. The survey combines a random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files; self-identified registered voters using NORC’s probability based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population; and self-identified registered voters selected from nonprobability online panels. The margin of sampling error for voters is estimated to be plus or minus 0.4 percentage points. 12/16/24, 7:28 PM Interactive: How key groups of A mericans voted in 2024 | PB S News chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
