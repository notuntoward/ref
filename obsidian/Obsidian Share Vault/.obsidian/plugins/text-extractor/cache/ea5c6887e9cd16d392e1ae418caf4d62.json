Ghodsi & M. Modabberifar Received: 15 March 2012 / Accepted: 10 September 2014 # Springer-Verlag London 2014 Abstract In this paper, a new voltage induction synchronous electrostatic motor (VISE motor) is introduced, and its perfor- mance is analyzed using analytical modeling. In the proposed motor, compared to similar size electrostatic motors, the pow- er is significantly improved by using active electrodes on both rotor and stator. Besides, the rotor’s electrodes are charged indirectly (via induction electrodes supplied on both the rotor and stator) to eliminate the undesirable wiring system. This leads to the remarkable features of the new design, including the simplicity, compactness, and light weight despite the fea- sibility of providing contactless rotor. In order to investigate the performance, the approach of the capacitance coefficient matrix has been used in which the coefficients are numerically calculated using the finite element method. In addition, the induced voltages and torque equation of motor are analytically derived and verified using the fabricated prototype and exper- imental setup. Kinetics, design, and fabrication process of a prototype are presented, and some performance parameters of motor such as ripple, maximum speed, and synchronousness are experimentally examined. To improve the performance and smoothness of motor rotation, the skew design for rotor electrodes is used and evaluated by both modeling and exper- iments. There is an excellent agreement between the experi- mental observations and analytical results, both indicating the considerable improvement in the motor power. Keywords Electrostatic . Actuator .

Ripple 1 Introduction Responding to the increasing application of micromachines in the electronic and mechatronic industries and due to influence of the weight and size of mobile actuators in small robots on dynamic behavior of the systems, design, and fabrication of small and lightweight actuators is intensively demanded [1]. Electromagnetic actuators are reasonably heavy and large, limiting their use in such structures. Additionally, in some applications, electromagnetic field affects other devices’ per- formance that results in undesirable outcomes. To overcome these issues, several actuators such as piezoelectric actuators, shape memory alloy actuators, and electrostatic actuators have been introduced. Piezoelectric actuators produce high power and velocity. However, due to the small displacement that they can provide, their applications are limited [2]. Shape memory alloy also has been used in some systems as actuator; however, their actua- tion is limited to low-power and low-frequency movements [3]. Moreover, all of these actuators need special materials with special production processes which make them expensive. Electrostatic motors are considered as relatively new actu- ators. Unlike the electromagnetic motors that use the magnetic force for the sake of torque generation, these motors use the generated electrostatic force between positive and negative electric charges.

Ghodsi Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, College of Engineering, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman Int J Adv Manuf Technol DOI 10.1007/s00170-014-6385-3 In the microscale, the output power of electrostatic motors respecting to their size is significantly higher than other types of motors, making them widely used in the microdevices and microelectromechanical systems [4–6]. The simplicity in the fabrication process due to the uncomplicated compact struc- ture is another feature of this type of motors that makes them special. Recently, several research studies have been conducted on electrostatic motors to extend their advantages (compactness, light weight, and simplicity) to the macroscale [7–14]. In this regard, continuous research studies have been conducted in University of Tokyo with the outstanding outcomes. For in- stance, in 1993, Ninno et al. presented an electrostatic motor, capable of generating power up to 230 kW/kg [7]. Introducing this motor named “dual excitation multiphase electrostatic drive (DEMED)” led to a new generation of electrostatic actuators, presented in several papers [8–11]. In the linear drive presented by Ninno, the electrodes of both slider and stator were directly fed by wires. This tech- nique amplified the voltage difference between the electrodes of slider and stator and increased the power of the actuator. Nevertheless, it is difficult to apply this method to rotational actuators since the wires limit the rotational range and cause unbalancing. This deficiency can be coped using other methods like transferring the signals to the rotor through slip rings [7, 11]. However, for this kind of signal transformation, one needs to equip additional parts that eventually enlarge the motor size and complicate the fabrication process, which is in contrast with the advantages of electrostatic motors. Later on, Yamashita et al. proposed the new idea of linear two-to-four phase electrostatic motor to ignore the wire connection to slider [12]. They generated the voltage on the slider by elec- trostatic induction between induction electrodes of both the stator and slider. In the present research, induction electrode idea is adopted for the three-to-three-phase rotational motor to introduce a new electrostatic synchronous type of motor. The voltages are supplied only to the stator, and driving electrodes on the rotor are charged by mutual induction electrodes placed on both the stator and rotor. Using this simple idea, the rotor will be capable of rotating without contact. It should be also noted that in the present design, no additional part is added to the motor. Therefore, the fabrication remains simple, and while the output power is higher than the similar motors, the size and weight do not increase. In this paper, the idea of new electrostatic rotational motor is introduced in section 2; then, the analytical approach and experimental investigations are presented to examine the per- formance of the proposed design. Herein, the capacitance coefficient matrix method [13] is used for the modeling pur- pose. Contrary to previous papers that have used prototype and experimental measurements to achieve the capacitance coefficient matrix [11–13], in this study, the numerical method is implemented, which is more applicable for modeling of similar actuators. Accuracy of modeling results is verified by comparing with experimental observations of a fabricated prototype of motor. Finally, to achieve a higher performance and smoothness in the rotation, the skew design for electrodes of the rotor is used, followed by an analytical modeling and experimental verification. 2 Principles 2.1 Configuration The schematic configuration of the motor is illustrated in Fig. 1. The electrodes’ arrangement and the connections be- tween electrodes and signals are depicted in Fig. 2, which shows a section view of Fig. 1. The section surface is displayed in Fig. 1. In this motor, rotor and stator are designed with the identical shape and number of electrodes. Electrodes are classified into two different groups of driving electrodes and induction electrodes, which are placed on both the rotor and stator. The driving electrodes, designed to generate the torque, are radial electrodes with rotational arrangement. Each of every three adjacent electrodes is connected to one of the phases of a three-phase AC signal. The pitch of driving electrodes is P,and thenumberofelectrodes on each of rotor and stator is 3n,while n is the number of electrodes’ sets and correlates with the electrode pitch in radians via the following relation: P ¼ 2π 3n ð1Þ 2.2 Driving principles Since this motor is a three-to-three-phase electrostatic motor, the driving electrodes of the stator are supplied directly by three signals with the same frequency (fsd)and theidentical zero-to-pick voltage (vsd) with the phase shifts of 120°. The driving signals vector is defined as follows: V sd ¼ v1; v2; v3½\u0000 ¼ vsd sin 2π f sdtðÞ; sin 2π f sdt þ 2π 3 \u0000\u0000; sin 2π f sdt \u0000 2π 3 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000T ð2Þ where v1, v2,and v3 are the three phases of driving signals, and t is the notation for the time. Induction electrodes, designed to charge the rotor electrodes, are symmetrically fabricated in ring shapes on the center of both the rotor and stator. The signals, supplied to the induction electrodes of the stator, are similar to the driving signals of the stator; however, they could be Int J Adv Manuf Technol in different frequencies (fsi) and zero-to-pick voltage (vsi). The induction signals vector is defined as follows: V si ¼ v4; v5; v6½\u0000 ¼ vsi sin 2π f sitðÞ; sin 2π f sit þ 2π 3 \u0000\u0000\u0000 ; sin 2π f sit \u0000 2π 3 \u0000\u0000\u0000T ð3Þ where v4, v5,and v6 are the three phases of induction signals. These signals induce charges to the induction elec- trodes of rotor, and these charges are then transferred to the driving electrodes of the rotor connected to each induction electrode (Fig. 2). It should be noted that the surface’s areas of each pair of induction electrodes are large enough compared to the gap between them, and they can be treated as conductive plates of a parallel plane capacitor. In the other words, one can assume the driving electrodes on the rotor to be connected to the induction signals through the intermediate capacitors (cn). In order to equate the capacitances of capacitors, the areas of in- duction electrodes are designed to be equivalent. The voltages of induced charges on the induction electrodes of the rotor can be written as follows: V r ¼ v7; v8; v9½\u0000T ð4Þ where v7, v8,and v9 are the unknown parameters yet to be determined. The voltages’ vector of electrodes in this motor can then be expressed as follows: V ¼ v1; v2; v3; v4; v5; v6; v7; v8; v9½\u0000T ð5Þ Driving principles of the motor is described in Fig. 3. Supplied signals to the driving electrodes generate rotational potential waves over the surface of rotor and stator. The relative rotational speed of the waves on the stator (us)and rotor (ur) regarding the stator and rotor, respectively, are as follows: us ¼ 3Pf sd ¼ 2π f sd n ; ur ¼ 3Pf si ¼ 2π f si n ð6Þ Torque is generated by the attractive/repulsive forces be- tween potential waves on the rotor and stator. The rotating Fig. 2 Section view of motor which shows the connections between electrodes and signals. Section surface is indicated in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 3D schematic view of motor idea which shows the electrode arrangement Int J Adv Manuf Technol potential wave on the rotor simply locks in with the rotating electric wave above the stator surface and rotates along with it, and the motor is said to be in synchronization until the oper- ation continues. In this condition, the relative speed between the rotor and stator can be expressed in the following form: u ¼ us \u0000 ur ¼ 3Pf sd \u0000 f siðÞ ð7Þ 2.3 Prototype parameters A prototype motor was designed to use in the experimental verifications. The important electrodes’ parameters required during the design are schematically illustrated in Fig. 4 and are set to the values tabulated in Table 1. 3Modeling 3.1 Method In this section, the torque and kinetic characteristics of the proposed motor have been analytically evaluated using the capacitance coefficient matrix method (CCMM) [12, 13]and the finite element technique. In the CCMM, the relation between rotor and stator electrodes can be represented by the assumed capacitors. The capacitance variation equations of these capacitors are then represented as a matrix called “ca- pacitance coefficient matrix.” Using this matrix, several char- acteristics of the actuator can be evaluated as it will be ex- plained in more details in the following sections of this paper. 3.2 Capacitance network The forgoing described capacitance network is illustrated in Fig. 5. Considering nine different voltages in the rotor and stator electrodes, the motor is modeled by a nine-terminal capacitance network, represented by a nine-by-nine matrix, where element in the ith row and jth column (cij) expresses the relation between ith and jth electrode. To define the capaci- tance coefficient matrix, all the elements should be studied, and the variation equation should be derived, accordingly. In previous works [11–13], these relations were calculated through the experiments which are difficult to conduct and practically inaccurate. To avoid these problems, the numerical method was used in the present paper. The motor in its real Fig. 3 Driving principles of motor Fig. 4 Design parameters of the boards in a set of electrodes Int J Adv Manuf Technol sizes was modeled in 3D by ANSYS software, meshed with element 123 (electrostatic 3D Tet), and the capacitance coef- ficients were calculated for various positions of the rotor with respect to the stator using the “stored energy method (SEM)” [15]. This method is developed to calculate the capacitances accurately in arbitrarily shaped 3D structures. The main idea behind this method is to calculate the capacitance on the basis of the evaluation of total energy stored in dielectric space around capacitor electrodes. The electric energy stored in dielectric space is computed easily using the FEM analysis. Geometric parameters of the model are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 6. The relative permittivity of the board’smaterials (FR-4) and the dielectric liquid (Novec 7100) surrounded the boards which used in modeling was assumed to be 4.8 and 7.4, respectively. Considering the symmetric design of motor, the relative position of the rotor was repeated for every 3P and consequently, the numerical modeling was performed for a single 3P period. Figure 7 shows the obtained graphs for all the coefficients, in which the similar coefficients are grouped in one diagram and electric angle (θp) is defined as follows: θp ¼ nθ ð8Þ where θ is the relative angle between the rotor and stator. Based on the numerical results, it has been postulated that the capacitance variation equations could be formulated by means of trigonometric functions. For the sake of simplicity, those coefficients of the very small values have been approximated to be zero. After ignoring some offset errors, the capacitance coefficient matrix of the motor with the simplified capacitance network model of Fig. 8 has been derived as follows: c ¼ csd θp \u0000\u0000 cd θp \u0000\u0000 cd θp \u0000\u0000 000 cp θp \u0000\u0000 cp θp þ 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 cp θp \u0000 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 cd θp \u0000\u0000 csd θp \u0000\u0000 cd θp \u0000\u0000 000 cp θp \u0000 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 cp θp \u0000\u0000 cp θp þ 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 cd θp \u0000\u0000 cd θp \u0000\u0000 csd θp \u0000\u0000 000 cp θp þ 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 cp θp \u0000 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 cp θp \u0000\u0000 000 ci 00 −ci 00 000 0 ci 00 −ci 0 000 0 0 ci 00 −ci cp θp \u0000\u0000 cp θp \u0000 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 cp θp þ 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 −ci 00 csd θp \u0000\u0000 þ ci cd θp \u0000\u0000 cd θp \u0000\u0000 cp θp þ 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 cp θp \u0000\u0000 cp θp \u0000 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 0 −ci 0 cd θp \u0000\u0000 csd θp \u0000\u0000 þ ci cd θp \u0000\u0000 cp θp \u0000 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 cp θp þ 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 cp θp \u0000\u0000 00 −ci cd θp \u0000\u0000 cd θp \u0000\u0000 csd θp \u0000\u0000 þ ci 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 ð9Þ cp φðÞ ¼ \u0000cp0 \u0000 cp1cos φðÞ \u0000 cp2cos 2φðÞ \u0000 cp3cos 3φðÞ ð10Þ csd φðÞ ¼ csd0 þ csd1cos 3φðÞ ð11Þ cd φðÞ ¼ \u0000cd0 \u0000 cd1cos 3φðÞ ð12Þ In this formulation, csd0, csd1, cd0, cd1, ci, cp0, cp1, cp2,and cp3 are positive coefficients, determined by averaging the foregoing numerical results as follows: csd0 ¼ 167:36; csd1 ¼ 7:90; ci ¼ 228:17; cd0 ¼ 36:7; cd1 ¼ 2:23; cp0 ¼ 30:08; cp1 ¼ 38:34; cp2 ¼ 10:92; cp3 ¼ 2:14 ð13Þ Table 1 Values of prototype parameters Parameters Value Parameters Value g(μm) 200 R1 (mm) 7 Wi (μm) 198 R2 (mm) 21 Wo (μm) 282 R3 (mm) 22 Ri (mm) 37.44 R4 (mm) 29.6 Ro (mm) 45.5 R5 (mm) 30.6 P (rad) 0.0106 R6 (mm) 36.44 n 195 R7 (mm) 47.5 Int J Adv Manuf Technol 3.3 Torque calculation It should be noted that the capacitance matrix needs to satisfy the following equation: q ¼ CV ð14Þ where q is the electrodes’ charges’ vector. When the ca- pacitance is represented as a matrix of size 9×9, the charges and voltages of electrodes are 9×1 vector. Voltage vector has been described before in Eq. 5. The charge vector q is defined as follows: q ¼ q1; q2; q3; q4; q5; q6; q7; q8; q9½\u0000T ð15Þ where q1 to q9 are the charges on electrodes first to ninth, respectively. As the electrodes on the rotor (seventh, eighth, and ninth) are not connected to the power supply, q7, q8,and q9 are set to be zero. Substituting back the component form of q, V,and C in Eq. 14 and solving the system of equations in terms of v7, v8,and v9, one can write: v7 ¼ 1 K 3vsd cp1sin θp þ 2πf sdt \u0000\u0000 þ cp2sin \u00002θp þ 2πf sdt \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 þ 2vsicisin 2πf sitðÞ ð16Þ v8 ¼ 1 K 3vsd cp1sin θp þ 2π f sdt þ 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 þ cp2sin \u00002θp þ 2π f sdt þ 2π 3 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 þ 2vsicisin 2π f sit þ 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 ð17Þ v9 ¼ 1 K 3vsd cp1sin θp þ 2π f sdt \u0000 2π 3 \u0000\u0000 þ cp2sin \u00002θp þ 2πf sdt \u0000 2π 3 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 þ 2vsicisin 2π f sit−2π 3 \u0000\u0000 ð18Þ where K is defined as K ¼ 2 cd0 þ ci þ csd0 þ csd1 þ cd1ðÞcos 3θp \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 ð19Þ For estimating the torque of the motor, the principle of virtual work is used.

This fact has been our main motivation to call the procedure (α)as “design phase.” 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental setup To verify the modeling and the accuracy of the formulation proposed for calculating the capacitance coefficients, an ex- perimental investigation has been conducted. A prototype motor shown in Fig. 9 and 10 was fabricated. Figure 9 shows the rotor and stator boards of the experimental setup, fabricat- ed using the printed circuit board (PCB) process and with the geometric parameters defined in Table 1. Figure 10 also shows the whole experimental setup. As it is depicted in this figure, to ensure the flatness of the rotor, its board was stuck on the hard drive aluminum disk. Besides, the stator board was first placed over the polycarbonate plate using four screws and Fig. 7 Numerical results for capacitance coefficients of motor Int J Adv Manuf Technol then fixed inside the container by two more screws. The rotor was located at the center of stator using an aluminum part which was used as the rotation axis and motor output. The attractive electrostatic force between the rotor and stator produce a large amount of friction that affects the stability in the movement. Therefore, the glass beads with the average diameter of 55 μm were scattered in the gap between the rotor and stator to facilitate the rotation. The container was filled by dielectric liquid (3 M Novec 7100) to reduce the possibility of electric discharge between electrodes due to high-voltage difference. The signals were first designed by Matlab/Simulink and produced in a low voltage by DSP (dSpace 1103) and were then amplified by three high-voltage amplifier Fig. 8 Simplified capacitance network model Fig. 9 Half view of rotor and stator boards of the experimental setup Int J Adv Manuf Technol (trek 609E), and finally were transferred to the stator electrodes through the input signal terminals attached to stator boards. A rotational encoder was used to trace the movement of rotor, and a torque sensor (Mark-10 Model: MTT03) was operated to measure the maximum torque of the motor. This sensor was connected directly to aluminum part to measure the generated torque of the rotor. Since this sensor measures the static (braking) torque and brings the motor down to a standstill, liquid damping has no effect on measurements. It should be also men- tioned that in the present experiments, peak voltages and frequencies for both driving and induction signals are identical and are expressed as follows: vsd ¼ vsi ¼ v0 ; f sd ¼\u0000 f si ¼ f 0 ð24Þ Fig. 10 Experimental setup used for verification Fig. 11 3D plot of torque variation of motor based on derived torque equation Int J Adv Manuf Technol 4.2 Model verification Figure 11 shows the torque variation of motor based on the proposed torque equation (Eq. 22) and using evaluated capac- itance coefficients in Eq. 13 while v0 is fixed to 1 kV. It is observed that torque profiles are changed in different rotor positions and different design phases. For instance, such pro- files are illustrated in Fig. 12. Rotor trajectory prediction under different loads is also examined in the present study by finding the equilibrium points in the torque equation. The equilibrium points are the points with the arbitrary constant torque and are defined as the Fig. 12 Sample torque profile in constant design phases Fig. 13 2D plot of torque profile with the predicted trajectory line of the rotor Int J Adv Manuf Technol intersection of the horizontal line of constant torque and the torque profile at each design phase with negative slope. Figure 12 shows the sample equilibrium points for τ=0 and τ=5 mN m. In order to find the trajectory of the rotor at constant velocity and constant torque, the equilibrium points should be calculated for all the design phases. 2D plot of torque profile with the predicted trajectory of the rotor under the constant torque τ=1mN m using equilibrium points is Fig. 14 Real movement of the rotor (f0=3.33 Hz, v0=1.4 kV) Fig. 15 Maximum static torque of the motor achieved by analytical calculation and experiments Int J Adv Manuf Technol depicted in Fig. 13. The prediction trajectory line, plotted by connecting the equilibrium points, predicts the stepping movement for the rotor. Figure 14 shows the real movement of the rotor while the motor was excited by signals with constant frequency of f0=3.33 Hz and v0=1.4 kV. No external load was applied to the rotor; however, the imposed load on the rotor due to its contact friction with the stator is not ignorable. The maximum static torque of motor (τsmax)is defined as the maximum generated torque in all various positions and design phases. The calculated values of τsmax for different applied voltages (v0)using Eq. 22 is plotted in Fig. 15.The experimental results are also provided for comparison. The reasonable agreement between the prediction line and real trajectory of rotor and moreover, maximum static torques achieved by analytical and experimental methods indicates the ability of our proposed torque equation and modeling ap- proach to evaluate the output torque of the motor. For low resistive loads, the equilibrium points could be calculated using the torque equation, and the model predicts the rotor trajectory under the load; however, for the loads greater than the maximum generated torque of the motor, the 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 -40 0 40 80 120 160 200 240Rotationspeed(rpm) Time (s) CBA u Smax u Amax Fig. 16 Speed up the motor with constant acceleration.

It was clarified that in speed down velocity profile of motor, there is a zone A also Int J Adv Manuf Technol equilibrium points are not existed, and therefore, the motor could not work and will be stopped. It could be concluded that this model is also valid if we assume the friction torque as a resistant load on the rotor. 4.3 Motor velocity profile In electromagnetic synchronous motors, two methods are used to synchronize the rotor speed with magnetic field. In the first approach, additional motor (like a step motor) is used to rotate the rotor in synchronous speed, but in the second method, motor starts to rotate from a low speed and following the rotational field to approach the higher speeds. Regardless of the method used for the synchronization, there are limits for acceleration and maximum speed of rotation in synchronous motors. As it was previously explained, VISE motor has been designed to run as a synchronous motor. Therefore, clarifying the limitations of its corresponding synchronous speed zone is necessary. For that reason, motor was accelerated from static form up to highest possible speed by constant acceleration. Figure 16 shows the speed profile while motor was operated with peak voltage of v0=1,400 V, and acceleration was kept constant at 2 rpm/s. Speed profile could be divided into three zones as depicted in Fig. 16: zone A or initial rotation zone, zone B or synchro- nous rotation zone, and zone C or asynchronous rotation zone. Rotation of rotor in initial zone (A) is unpredictable and depends to voltage, load, and friction between rotor and stator surface. Rotor starts to rotate with vibration which is amplified by increasing the frequency. Figure 17 shows the comparison between designed speed and real speed of motor for speed up, constant speed, and speed down movement. Base on this figure, zone A is appeared not only in the start of rotation but also in the low velocities when the speed is declined. This zone appears because of the low frequency in induction elec- trodes. Amplitude of the induced voltages on induction Fig. 18 Skew electrode design for rotor Fig. 19 Optimization of the skew factor by the numerical method Int J Adv Manuf Technol electrodes of rotor directly depends on the frequency of in- duction signal (fsi), meaning that by increasing fsi,voltage amplitude of the induced signal on induction electrodes of rotor increases. Thus, in the low frequencies with the weak induction signal, the generated torque is low and the rotor is not able to rotate with the desired speed. Using the similar analogy, one could also postulate that increasing the frequency cause the output torque to increase and rotor starts to rotate. Once rotor starts to rotate with the electric field speed, the synchronous zone (B) (see Fig. 16) begins and continues up to the point in which resistive loads on rotor exceed the generat- ed torque and the rotor speed immediately decreases. It should be noted that in this zone, synchronous maximum speed (uSmax) indicates the maximum rotational velocity in which the rotor can follow the applied field, synchronously. After this point, asynchronous zone (C) begins with unclear varia- tion in the speed profile. A temporary increase in the speed was observed by increasing the frequency of signal before the motor comes to a complete stop. Asynchronous maximum speed parameter (uAmax) indicates maximum rotational veloc- ity in which the rotor stops at the end of the asynchronous zone (C). 5 Performance improvement As it is shown in the previous section, rotor trajectory is stepwise. This characteristic increases the undesirable vibra- tions and decreases the smoothness in the rotation. In this section, In order to improve the motor performance, an ap- proach is suggested and is examined by experiments. 5.1 Skew design As it is shown in Fig. 11, torque generation character- istics vary by the time and position of the rotor. Since this functionality emanates from the variation in Fig. 20 Capacitance coefficient variation for skewed motor Fig. 21 3D plot of torque variation of skewed motor Int J Adv Manuf Technol capacitance coefficients, it seems that by canceling the capacitance coefficients’ harmonics, the motor perfor- mance will be improved. This approach is verified using the torque equation (Eq. 22). In this equation, if the parameters of cd1, csd1,and cp2 decrease to the very small values of order zero, the equation will be simpli- fied to only one term and will predict a smooth profile for the output torque. Fig. 22 Real trajectory of the rotor in skewed motor Fig. 23 Maximum static torque of skewed motor Int J Adv Manuf Technol In order to change the capacitances’ variation profile, the design of the electrodes should be accordingly changed. In [13], the skew design has been suggested for linear motor to decrease the thrust force ripple. In this paper, the skew design is adopted to this motor to improve the performance. Figure 18 shows the skew electrode design used for the rotor. As it is depicted; the end points of driving electrodes on the rotor are skewed by the value of s with respect to the initial positions, while the electrode pitch and gap are kept the same as before. Shape and the arrangement of stator electrodes are also set to be fixed. The so-called “skew factor s” is within the electric angle. In order to find the optimum value of the skew factor, the parameter kr is defined as follows: kr ¼ cp1 cp2 cd1 þ csd1ðÞ ð25Þ Based on torque equation (Eq. 22), decreasing the parameters cd1, csd1,and cp2 result in decreasing the ripple and increasing the parameter cp1 cause increasing the torque. Both of these varia- tions lead to increase the value of the parameter kr, and thus, optimum value of the skew factor is one that maximized kr. Based on the results of Fig. 19 evaluated from our numerical calculations of these parameters, the optimum value of s is obtained ats=π (equal to 1.5P). This valueisthenusedtodesign the motor.

As it can be observed, these results confirm the reduction of harmonics in skew approach.

However, the induction coefficient (ci) is appeared in the torque factor due to the existence of induction electrodes. 5.2 Skew design verification The torque variation for the skewed motor using our new torque equation (Eq. 32) and achieved coefficient in Eq. 28 is illustrated in Fig. 21. The smooth characteristics of the motor can be easily seen. It can be observed that under a constant load, motor works at constant speed and acts as a synchronous motor. Rotational velocity of the motor can be also derived using Eq. 32. At a constant load, the following equation can be written as 2π f sd \u0000 f siðÞt þ nθ ¼ δ ð34Þ where δ is the constant angle depending on the load. Derivative of Eq. 34 with respect to the time gives the angular velocity of motor (ω)as follows: ω ¼ 2π f si \u0000 f sdðÞ n ð35Þ Int J Adv Manuf Technol This equation expresses that the angular velocity of the actuator is related to the difference between frequencies of driving and induction voltages combined with geometric parameters. Figure 22 shows the real trajectory of the rotor in skewed motor while electrodes are excited by signals with constant frequency of fsi=−fsd=f0=3.33 Hz and v0=1.4 kV. As it is expected, in contrast to the normal motor, the prototype skewed motor shows a smooth motion trajectory, proving our claim about the skew approach we proposed. The maximum static torque of the skewed motor calculated for different applied voltages (v0) using Eq. 32 in comparison with the experimental results is illustrated in Fig. 23.The experimental findings show the remarkable compatibility with the analytical outcomes and verify our derived formulation for skewed motor torque. 5.3 Skewed design velocity profile Figure 24 shows the speed profile of motor when it was operated with the peak voltage of v0=1,400 V, and accelera- tion was set to the constant value of 2 rpm/s. Like the non- skewed motor, speed profile of the skewed motor consisted of three different zones of A, B, and C. However, the zone ranges were changed which accepted the improvement in motor performance. As it is illustrated in Fig. 25, which shows the 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260Rotationspeed(rpm) Voltage amplitude (V) u Amax (Non-skewed motor) u Smax (Non-skewed motor) u Smax (skewed motor) Fig. 26 Rotational max speed variation for normal and skewed motor in different voltages 0 10 2030 4050 6070 8090 100 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 22.53457Rotationspeed(rpm) Time (s) 2 2.5 3 4 5 7 8 Acceleration (rpm/s) 8 Fig. 27 Speed profile for speeding up and speeding down the motor by different accelerations; start and end of zone A is nearly similar for all accelerations Int J Adv Manuf Technol comparison between speed profile of the skewed motor and non-skewed motor, zone A covers a smaller range in skewed motor compared to non-skewed motor. In other words, syn- chronous zone B is started in a lower speed. On the other hand, maximum synchronous speed of skewed motor is greater than non-skewed motor. The experimental results for maximum synchronous speed of non-skewed and skewed motors in different zero-to-peak voltages are illustrated in Fig. 26.For comparison, maximum asynchronous speed of non-skewed motor is also plotted in the figure. From this figure, it can be highlighted that maximum synchronous speed of skewed mo- tor is near to maximum asynchronous speed of non-skewed motor and approximately 40 % greater than maximum syn- chronous speed of non-skewed motor. Consequently, synchro- nous zone in skewed motor covers more extensive range of speeds that is also more desirable in the industrial applications. In [14], the authors showed that speed up acceleration affects the motor performance. To clarify the acceleration effect on this motor, several experiments were performed. Results showed that acceleration has no effect on synchronous max speed; however, it is important for starting the rotation. Figure 27 shows the speed profile of skewed motor for speed- ing up and down by those accelerations that cause the motor to start rotating individually. If speed up acceleration was select- ed out of this range, motor would need external torque to start rotating. Furthermore, Fig. 27 clears that acceleration has no effect on the start and end speed of zone A. As showninFigs. 24 and 27 and explained in section 4.3, due to low frequency of the induction signals, the motor cannot work well in zone A. Although after the ripple reduction, the range of this zone was decreased, and due to same reason, zone A was not removed. As a result, zone B is the applicable speed range of the motor, and zone A still remains as a limitation that should be studied in future works to be removed. 6 Conclusion A new three-to-three-phase electrostatic rotational motor called “voltage induction synchronous electrostatic motor (VISE mo- tor)” is proposed and characterized using the modeling and analytical calculations. A 9×9 capacitance coefficient matrix is used, and the induced voltages and torque are analytically derived. Based on the coefficient parameters achieved by the numerical method, the torque and trajectory of the rotor were first calculated and were then verified by observations from the experiments conducted on the presented experimental setup. Regarding to the numerical results, the optimization of the skew factor showed that skew of 1.5 electrode pitches is the optimum value for improving the performance of the motor. In addition, the measured trajectory of the rotor exhibited the smoother characteristic of the skewed motor. Comparing to the previous rotational electrostatic synchro- nous motors, VISE motor present the significant improvement in the torque generation. Synchronous motor presented in [15] produced maximum torque of 0.45 mN m while the amplitude of the applied excitation signals was 500 V, whereas skew motor generated about 1 mN m torque in the same applied voltage shows about 120 % improve in torque generation. In order to achieve the higher values of torque, the rotor and stator could be produced in a multilayer scheme. Since the rotor and stator boards of our presented motor can be fabri- cated in the thin layers, the multilayer rotor and stator still remain small and lightweight, which is expected for using in more applications in industries.
