We discuss one three-step approach for doing so, focusing on how such forecasts might help the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) prepare unexpected net load ramps, where net load equals gross demand minus wind and solar production. First, we enhance an existing solar forecasting system to provide well-calibrated hours-ahead probabilistic forecasts. We then relate the degree of uncertainty reﬂected in the forecasted prediction intervals (independent variables) to error distributions for net load ramp forecasts for the CAISO real-time market (dependent variable) using machine learning and quan- tile regression. Projected ramp forecast errors conditioned on solar uncertainty are translated into ﬂexible ramp requirements that therefore reﬂect real-time meteorological and solar conditions, improving on typical ISO pro- cedures. Detailed descriptions are provided on the quantile regression and kth-nearest neighbor categorization methods for accomplishing that translation. Finally, a multiple time-scale look-ahead market simulation model is applied to a 118-bus IEEE Reliability Test System, modiﬁed to represent the CAISO generation mix and demand distributions. The model runs quantify how solar-conditioned ramp requirements can, ﬁrst, decrease operating costs by reducing requirements compared to often conservative unconditional methods and, second, decrease generation scarcity events and consequently improve reliability by increasing ﬂexibility requirements at times when unconditional forecast-based requirements understate actual ramp uncertainty. Solar-conditioned ramp re- quirements are found to reduce generation operating costs by about 2% for the test system (which would be equivalent to over $100 million per year for a CAISO-size system). 1. Introduction Variable renewable generation is rapidly expanding in California and elsewhere, both in the form of behind-the-meter rooftop solar, and as grid-scale development of wind and solar resources [ 1 ]. As a result, the short-term variability in system net load that must be met by dispatch- able thermal, hydro, and storage resources is also growing quickly [ 2 ]. It is widely recognized that improvements in solar forecasts can signiﬁ- cantly reduce operating costs, improve system reliability, and even save capital costs in the long run [ 3 ]. Here, we focus on the value of a par- ticular enhancement to solar forecasting technology: the development of probabilistic forecasts that not only predict a median or expected ∗ Corresponding author.

In particular, we describe a new approach for using probabilistic solar forecasts to improve the def- inition of requirements for operating reserves, and illustrate it with an application to procurement of ﬂexible ramp product for the CAISO sys- tem. The CAISO and other North American ISOs buy operating reserves of various types to accommodate this variability for the California mar- ket on various time scales [ 4 ]. Among these reserves are 30-minute replacement reserves, 10-minute spinning and non-spinning reserves, regulation-up, and regulation-down, with the last two handling unex- pected variations on a sub-5-minute scale. These are acquired in the day- ahead CAISO market, with adjustments possible in its real-time market https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seja.2022.100024 Received 2 May 2022; Received in revised form 10 September 2022; Accepted 12 September 2022 Available online 15 September 2022 2667-1131/© 2022 The Author(s).

Solar Energy Advances 2 (2022) 100024 (which is part of the western US- and Canada-wide Energy Imbalance Market (EIM), whose other entities only procure or sell real-time en- ergy in the EIM). The real-time market includes two separate but linked markets, one with 15-minute intervals that can allow commitment of short-start generation units, and a subsequent dispatch-only market with 5-minute intervals. In addition to the operating reserves mentioned above, the CAISO has developed a new real-time product in 2016 called the ﬂexible ramp product (FRP). FRP, which is the focus of our application, is designed to position supply and storage resources in each time interval of the EIM to feasibly accommodate unexpected deviations in net load ramp from that interval to subsequent intervals either in the downward or upward di- rection (designated “FRD ”and “FRU, ” respectively), and to compensate resources for any resulting foregone energy revenues [ 5–7 ]. Finally, the CAISO is proposing a day-ahead product called the imbalance reserve product that will not only procure resources that could be needed to meet real-time FRP needs, but also accommodate deviations between day-ahead and real-time net load forecasts with a predetermined relia- bility of 95% [ 8 ]. Operating reserves can be expensive to procure, amounting to almost $200 million for the CAISO in 2020 (out of the total energy and ancillary services cost of $8 billion), or about $1/MWh [ 9 ]. Consequently, ISO engineers and the research community have paid signiﬁcant attention to the general issues of what types, amounts, and locations of reserves to procure. Optimizing those procurement decisions must strike a bal- ance between the costs of reserving capacity (e.g., costs of contracting fuel ahead of time in case it is needed, and the wear-and-tear and fuel cost of keeping extra capacity on stand-by), and the beneﬁts in terms of improved reliability (avoiding voluntary or involuntary curtailment of load) and reduced fuel and other variable costs of expensive peak- ing generation that would otherwise be called upon during periods of scarcity [ 10 ]. A crucial input to calculating the desired amount of reserves is the degree of uncertainty in net load. This uncertainty depends upon time of day, season, and especially meteorological uncertainty that in turn translates into uncertainty in solar insolation, wind, stream ﬂows, and temperature-dependent loads. Probabilistic forecasts of these quantities on appropriate timescales (e.g., 12-36 hours ahead for day-ahead power markets and minutes to hours ahead for real-time markets) can inform estimates of the magnitude of net load uncertainty that needs to be covered by reserves (e.g., [ 11 ]). Li and Zhang [ 12 ] summarize several approaches to using probabilistic forecasts to inform operating reserve procurement. The most common one is for “situational awareness ”, in which system operators informally consult these forecasts when adjust- ing reserve requirements. More formal “dynamic reserve ” approaches that are under consideration use statistical models, such as quantile re- gression, to condition net load uncertainty on weather conditions or the amounts of variable renewables, and then to set the reserve require- ments based on a maximum tolerable probability of net load exceeding the reserves [ 13 ]. Due to the exceptionally rapid growth in solar gen- eration, increasing attention is being paid to using probabilistic solar forecasts to inform operating reserve procurement, but there is a lack of systematic methods to integrate such forecasts into operations and scheduling routines [ 12 ]. Here we focus on the potential for using probabilistic solar forecasts to set ramp product requirements for the CAISO system, which has the largest solar penetration of any U.S. ISO-based market. 1 Presently, in 1 See also [ 13 ], who propose alternative approaches for using probabilistic forecasts for reserves sizing for the CAISO, emphasizing approaches based on generating sets of scenarios of potential solar generation and then calculating implied reserve requirements. Our methodology also diﬀers from the CAISO’s proposed use of quantile regression to set FRP requirements [ 5 ] in our use of independent variables that represent the degree of solar uncertainty (e.g., the width of the central 50% prediction interval between the 25th and 75th per- centiles of solar insolation), rather than just expected solar and wind output. order to decide on how much of the two types of ramp products (FRD and FRU) to procure, the CAISO considers the distribution of ramp fore- cast errors in the relevant time interval over the previous few weeks. By creating a histogram of those errors, the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles can be estimated; the CAISO uses these percentiles to deﬁne the MW of “uncertainty component ”in the down- and up-directions to be acquired. The net down- and up-requirements for ramp in a given period are then deﬁned as the expected ramp forecast adjusted down and up to account for those two uncertainty components, respectively. Fig. 1 , adapted from CAISO documentation, illustrates the deﬁni- tion of FRP for the 15-minute EIM market. The y- axis shows the MW quantity of energy and ﬂexible capacity to be provided by the market, and the x- axis is time. Supply, storage, and demand-side resources sub- mit bids (MW quantity and $/MWh prices) to a given market run 52.5 minutes prior to the start of the so-called “binding ” interval (covering time t to t + 15), for which ﬁnancially binding schedules for those re- sources will be optimized and settled at the prices calculated by the market process. The optimization simultaneously optimizes short-start unit commitment and dispatch for the binding interval along with sev- eral subsequent “advisory ” 15-minute intervals. Advisory schedules are not ﬁnancially binding, but serve a “look ahead ”purpose to ensure that resources are positioned in the binding interval so that net loads in later intervals are eﬃciently met. The solid line in the ﬁgure shows the fore- cast made at t-52.5 of energy demand in each interval (here, the binding interval plus the subsequent three advisory intervals). Finally, the ﬁg- ure shows, as dashed lines, how much resource capacity needs to be scheduled to meet FRU and FRD requirements in the advisory intervals. For example, the type and amount of resources scheduled in the binding interval [t,t + 15] have to be able to feasibly move over 15 minutes to meet the forecast net load in the ﬁrst advisory interval [t + 15,t + 30] plus the 97.5 th percentile error (the upper dashed line) in the case of FRU, and minus the 2.5 th percentile error (the lower dashed line) in the case of FRD. This constraint is also imposed in each advisory interval, with that interval’s resource schedule having suﬃcient ﬂexibility to meet the range of possible ramps deﬁned by those errors in the next advisory interval, as illustrated. The requirements for ramp product are enforced by soft constraints in the CAISO real-time market’s resource optimization software, in the form of demand curves for MW of FRD and FRU in each interval. These demand curves reﬂect the understanding that the incremental value of the product declines as more is procured, but that there is not a ﬁxed requirement or threshold below which a product has a high value (re- ﬂected in a large violation penalty in the market software) and above which it has no value. Further, the CAISO recognizes [ 5 ], as does most of the industry [ 13 ], that deﬁning requirements independent of informa- tion on weather and renewable energy production conditions will result, under some meteorological conditions, in overly conservative require- ments well in excess of the actual need in a given day, thus inﬂating costs. Meanwhile, under other conditions when uncertainty is greater, procurement will be too little, exposing the system to risks of inadequate ﬂexibility reserves and undesirably high probabilities of load balance vi- olations. Since solar generation variability is a major source of net load uncertainty, it is logical to expect that forecasts of the net load ramp uncertainty components shown in Fig. 1 could be usefully conditioned on weather and renewable conditions [ 5 ], especially solar uncertainty. In this paper, we summarize the procedures and some of the results of a research project directed at translating probabilistic solar forecasts into weather-conditioned projections of FRP needs for the CAISO sys- tem (for details, see [ 14 ]). Among these results are an updated Watt- Sun solar forecasting system, models linking probabilistic solar fore- casts to system netload ramp uncertainty, and a comparison of system costs resulting from the revised requirements with the costs under the present CAISO unconditioned histogram approach for a IEEE 118-bus system modiﬁed to include a generation mix similar to the CAISO sys- tem ( Fig. 2 ). The rest of the paper is organized into three parts: develop- ment of probabilistic solar forecasts from the Watt-Sun forecasting sys- 2 B.F. Hobbs, J. Zhang, H.F. Hamann et al.

That section carefully identiﬁes the sources of cost savings that result from using solar uncertainty-informed requirements for ramp product. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper. 2. Probabilistic solar forecasting We have taken advantage of IBM’s big-data platform Physical Ana- lytics Integrated Repository and Services (PAIRS) [ 15,16 ] and quantile regression of forecast errors (one for each class of weather conditions identiﬁed by artiﬁcial intelligence [ 17 ]) to generalize the Watt-Sun so- lar forecasting system [ 15 ] to generate probabilistic forecasts. PAIRS cu- rates terabytes of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and his- torical data, including the high-resolution GOES-R imagery (NOAA L2 product’s cloud optical depth). By blending multiple NWPs and imagery data using deep learning methods and quantile regressions to obtain a set of critical percentiles, we developed a big data-driven probabilistic forecasting system, whose ﬂow chart is shown in Fig. 3 . The system has been implemented for 10 observation sites each in the CAISO and Mid- Continent ISO footprints for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) forecasts. GHI represents the overall amount of shortwave solar radiation received at ground level. A prototype raster-based system using the GOES-R im- agery has also been developed to create GHI irradiance forecasts on a 3 km pixel grid covering locations without direct observations. Fig. 4 shows an example of Watt-Sun probabilistic forecasts of GHI, illustrating (from left to right) a sunny day, a partly cloudy day, and two very cloudy days. The graphs show that, in this case, the sunnier days not only have a higher median (green line), but also less uncertainty (measured by the width of the prediction interval between, for instance, the 25 th and 75 th percentiles, shown in orange and red, respectively). Based on P-P plot scores, the Watt-Sun probabilistic forecasts are better calibrated than baseline persistence and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) bias-corrected forecasts ( Fig. 5 ). A P-P score measures the total deviation (mean absolute value) of a plot of predicted versus empirical error cumulative distributions from the perfect (45 o ) calibra- tion line (the total area between the two lines in each ﬁgure). Figs. 6 and 7 provide further evidence of the quality of calibration of probabilistic Watt-Sun. Fig. 6 shows actual GHI and Watt-Sun’s reported probability distributions for the ﬁfteen-minute interval centered on 1:30 p.m. local time for Dec. 2019 for the Topaz, CA site. There are 28 days of data, of which 9 days have values falling above the 50 th percentile. Whether this could happen by chance can be assessed by a, e.g., 𝜒 2 (Chi-squared) test; if the test does not reject the hypothesis that the observations were drawn from the shown distribution, then it would be concluded that the model is well-calibrated for that period. (Such a test for a set of daily observations for one particular time is reasonable if it is assumed that errors from day to day are independent, which is a strong assumption.) The plot shows how the prediction intervals change from day-to-day; for instance, Dec. 1-8 were cloudy days with more solar uncertainty (lower medians and wider intervals) while Dec. 9-20 were sunnier (higher medians, narrower intervals). Plots like Fig. 7 , which is an example binning of the observed GHI for all daylight hours in one month (red) compared to the 5%/20%/25%/25%/20%/5% expected frequencies, provide visual evidence of a good calibration, as its 𝜒 2 value that indicates that the two distributions are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. 3. Using probabilistic solar forecasts to create solar-conditioned requirements for ﬂexible ramp product 3.1. Weather dependence of net load ramps As stated above, the CAISO introduced ramp products in its real-time markets that procure generation “ramping ” capacity so that potential net load ramp uncertainty can be managed feasibly. The purpose is to reduce the frequency of generation scarcity events and real-time price spikes. Speciﬁcally, the up- and down-FRP (FRU and FRD, respectively) address both expected ramps from one real-time interval to the next, plus an uncertainty component representing possible positive and neg- ative errors, respectively, in net load forecasts. Presently, to determine the uncertainty component, the CAISO uses histograms of net load fore- 3 B.F. Hobbs, J. Zhang, H.F. Hamann et al. Solar Energy Advances 2 (2022) 100024 Fig. 3.

Site-speciﬁc probabilistic global horizontal ir- radiance (GHI) forecasts (April 2-5, 2019, Topaz Cali- fornia solar site, 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th per- centiles), Probabilistic Watt-Sun 1.0 system. cast errors on an hourly basis, considering all errors in that hour from the previous 40 days (if the day is a weekday) or 20 days (if the day is a weekend) [ 6 ]. After the construction of histograms, the upper and lower bounds of the 95% conﬁdence interval are used as the up- and down-FRP requirements, respectively, for that hour. The 95% conﬁdence interval for accounting for uncertainties is a well-accepted industry standard that strikes a balance between reliability and economics. We term these “un- conditional ”or “solar independent ”FRP requirements. A reasonable expectation is that the forecast error tends to be greater during a partially cloudy day, while being lower in a sunny or com- pletely overcast day. However, by constructing histograms of forecast er- rors purely from historical data, the CAISO’s unconditional method does not reﬂect the latest weather information and often leads to overestima- tion of ramp uncertainty under sunny weather conditions and underesti- mation under partly cloudy conditions. As clearly depicted in Fig. 8 , be- low, CAISO’s requirements in two close days (8/7/19 and 8/12/19) are 4 B.F. Hobbs, J. Zhang, H.F. Hamann et al. Solar Energy Advances 2 (2022) 100024 Fig. 5.

From top, the blue dashed lines are the results for linear quantile regression estimates of the 90th, 75th, 50th, and 25th percentiles of load forecast errors. almost identical since the histograms are similar. However, as the blue lines in the ﬁgure show, the weather conditions in these two days are totally diﬀerent: the bottom of the left ﬁgure presents a lower and ﬂuc- tuating proﬁle of system-wide solar power, suggesting relatively cloudy weather, while the lower right proﬁle shows a smooth and stable output, consistent with sunny conditions. Consequently, the need for FRP is very diﬀerent on those two days: greater uncertainties in cloudy days should contribute to higher FRP requirements, while sunny weather should be a reason for lower FRP requirements due to reduced uncertainty. If the same amount of FRP is procured in both days, the cloudy day might have a high probability of FRP shortage, and hence a risk of capacity shortages, while the market eﬃciency would be reduced in the sunny day due to over-procurement. In order to improve upon current industry practice of weather- unconditioned reserve requirements, we used quantile regression and a machine learning method (kth nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁcation) to relate the 95% conﬁdence intervals in net load forecast errors to uncertainty in forecasted GHI in order to create solar-conditioned FRP requirements. These methods are summarized in the next two subsec- tions. Fig. 9 illustrates that there is a strong dependence of up-ramp uncertainty (positive errors, shown on the y-axis) 2 on the width of the 2 The upward ramp forecast error for a given interval is calculated by the following procedure which is unique to the CAISO. Consider the ramp forecast between intervals [t,t + 15] and [t + 15,t + 30] in Fig. 1 . The upward ramp error 25th-75th percentile prediction interval (shown on the x-axis), the latter derived from the Watt-Sun probabilistic forecasting system (from solar forecast data such as Figs. 4 and 6 ). 3.2. Using quantile regression (QR) to link solar forecasts to FRP needs The QR method [ 19 ], which we used to obtain the relationships shown as dashed lines in Fig. 9 , can be viewed as an advanced ver- sion of histogram method used by the CAISO. QR boosts the prediction performance of the baseline histogram method by integrating the lat- est weather information, including but not limited to probabilistic solar forecasts, into estimates of ﬂexible ramping requirements that the power grid needs to address net load uncertainty. Speciﬁcally, in contrast to the baseline method where a histogram of unconditional historical net load forecast errors are referred to when calculating ramp needs, the weather-informed QR method relies on an estimated posterior distribu- tion of net load forecast errors given the inputs of meteorological and other variables (especially the forecast probability distribution of solar irradiance) at a future interval. The posterior distribution of net load errors is thus conditioned on the information input (for instance, if the value of the x-axis in Fig. 9 is relatively high, i.e., a relatively large value of the width of the prediction interval deﬁned by the 25th-75th percentiles of GHI), as the blue dashed lines in Fig. 9 show. Mathematically, QR estimates the vector of coeﬃcients 𝛽q for each line in Fig. 9 (one line for each quantile q considered) by choosing 𝛽q that minimizes Eqn. (1) , below. Deﬁne y i as the value of the indepen- dent variable for the i -th observation (the forecast error for net ramp, as explained in Footnote 2, above, or just its positive component, as in the case of upward errors as in Fig. 9 ), and let x i be the vector of in- dependent variables corresponding to observation i . For instance, in a multivariate QR with two input variables, we could have x i 0 = 1 to allow for an intercept, x i 1 = median predicted solar GHI, and x i 2 = width of the 25th-75th percentiles-based prediction interval for GHI. Linear pro- gramming is then used to accomplish the minimization shown below: is the diﬀerence between 1) the highest binding interval forecast from the 5- minute market among the three 5-minute intervals in period [t + 15,t + 30] (not shown in Fig. 1 ) and 2) the ﬁrst advisory interval forecast made for the 15- minute interval [t + 15,t + 30] in the previous 15-minute market run (i.e., whose binding interval was [t,t + 15]), shown as the second orange dot on the solid orange line in Fig. 1 . Thus, this is the diﬀerence between two forecasts, and not between a forecast and actual net load. A positive error indicates that the forecast closer in time to actual operations (the binding interval forecast) is higher than was anticipated in the earlier market run, and so the system has to meet a steeper ramp in net load than anticipated. 6 B.F.

The ﬁrst term in (1) is the sum of the diﬀerences (weighted by q ) between the observed value of y i and the predicted value 𝛽q x i only for i in which the observed value exceeds what is predicted. The second term is instead 1- q times the sum of those diﬀerences for i where instead the observed value is below the predicted value. By weighing the ﬁrst term q/ (1- q ) times as much as the second term, QR attempts to ﬁnd the relationship (a line in the case of Fig. 9 , or, more generally, the hyperplane) that results in fraction q of the ob- servations lying below the relationship. In this study, load and weather forecast variables (also known as clas- siﬁers) are used as regressors in our QR models to predict distributions of upward and downward net load errors at future intervals. Since, the CAISO is interested in setting the FRP down and up requirements at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, respectively, in theory we could do two QR regressions, one for q = 0.025 and one for q = 0.975. However, when a relatively small sample is used, such as the last 30 days, the resulting relationships are unstable because few observations occur in these tails. For this reason, we use more stable QR relationships obtained for inter- mediate rather than extreme values of q , and then assume normality to extrapolate tail percentiles. Thus, in the case of upward errors our QR relationships are estimated for q = 0.5 and 0.9. Then a normal distribu- tion is calibrated to those values (by obtaining the implied mean and standard deviation), and then the desired 97.5th percentile is extrapo- lated using that distribution. For downward errors, instead q = 0.1 and 0.5 are used in the same fashion, with the 2.5th percentile estimated by calibrating a normal distribution to those percentiles. The independent variables we used in the QR are constructed as fol- lows. First, two solar variables are considered. For a selection of up to 10 solar sites across the state of California, 2 hour-ahead probabilistic GHI forecasts over selected sites with 15-min resolution are used to cal- culate GHI m and GHI w . The former denotes the average (across sites) of the 50th percentile (median) of probabilistic forecasts of GHI. Its value is of particular interest to the procurement of FRP, as an inverse-U re- lationship between net load uncertainty and median GHI m is revealed by our analysis of the data: it is observed that net load forecasts errors of a particular time interval are smaller when the value of GHI m of the forecast interval is near its high or low extremes. Meanwhile, net load uncertainty tends to be highest when GHI m is intermediate. The sec- ond input, GHI w is deﬁned as the average (over sites considered) of the 25th-75th prediction interval width, and measures the 2-hour-ahead un- certainty in ground-level solar radiation within a given 15-min interval. As Figs. 8 and 9 indicate, solar uncertainty is a useful predictor to deter- mine the amount of FRP procurement. In addition to probabilistic solar forecasts, 15-min wind forecast and load forecasts from the real-time CAISO energy market are other two independent variables we consid- ered for to estimate FRP needs, as those variables are linearly related to net load (i.e., net load is total load minus wind and solar power). To summarize, the following steps are used to estimate and apply QR models predict FRP-up requirements. (Analogous steps are used for FRP-down requirements.) 1 Training Data. For a given day, training data (net load forecast errors y i and independent variables x i , as deﬁned above) are pooled by hour of the day for the previous N days of the same type (e.g., we considered N = 30 in the case of weekdays). Thus, the models are updated daily in a rolling fashion. 2 Training. QR relationships are estimated by solving Eqn. (1) for q = 0.5 and 0.9, yielding two relationships for each daylight hour. 3 Determine the FRP Requirements. FRP-up requirements for a given hour are estimated by inserted the forecast values of x i for that hour in the two estimated QR relationships, yielding estimated 50 th and 90 th percentiles for net load error in the upward direction. From those values, the 97.5 th percentile is extrapolated by assuming a nor- mal distribution for the net load forecast error. The latter percentile is the amount of FRP that can then be used to deﬁne the FRP re- quirement in the ﬁfteen-minute market optimizations for that hour. For simplicity, our FESTIV-based simulations in Section 4 assume ﬁxed requirements that can be relaxed at a ﬁxed per MW penalty; in reality, the CAISO deﬁnes a “demand curve ”for FRP that has an increasing marginal penalty for larger deviations from the require- ment. 3.3. Using kth-nearest neighbor classiﬁcation to link solar forecasts to FRP needs In addition to the QR method illustrated in Fig. 9 , various speciﬁca- tions of a machine learning approach (based on the kth-nearest neigh- bor (kNN) classiﬁcation method [ 20 ]) were also tested with diﬀerent combinations of GHI variables at various solar generation sites in the CAISO. Examples of GHI variables considered include median, 50% con- ﬁdence interval width, and volatility in 50% prediction intervals from 15-minute to 15-minute market interval. The kNN-based method is a non-parametric classiﬁcation approach, and it can be viewed as a direct extension of the CAISO’s original implementation, since both methods rely on historical data. In both methods, the upward and downward FRP requirements at a certain time interval are given by the predictive dis- tributions of errors in upward and downward net load forecasts, respec- tively. The diﬀerence, however, is that the kNN-based method constructs posterior (weather-conditioned) histograms by using probabilistic solar forecasts. A brief summary of our application of the kNN-based method to FRP requirements estimation is given below, and more details can be found in [ 21 ]. 1 Characterize the weather conditions : Given probabilistic solar irradi- ance forecasts during a time interval, the kNN-based method uses a set of numerical classiﬁers to characterize the weather conditions during that interval. 2 Find similar historical days and construct weather-conditioned distribu- tions of net load forecast errors : We then ﬁnd historical intervals with similar weather conditions to the target interval, where the similar- ity of a pair of time intervals is represented by Euclidean distances between two numerical classiﬁers. After suﬃcient similar historical days are identiﬁed, we construct histograms using net load forecast errors from these days and then ﬁt cumulative density functions for upward and downward errors. 3 Determine the FRP requirements : The kNN-based method then deter- mines the up- and down-FRP requirements based on the 95% conﬁ- dence intervals of the cumulative density functions. The performance of the kNN-based method relies heavily on the nu- merical classiﬁer and the number of closest neighbors. Our study sug- gests that performance is also sensitive to the size of validation set, which consists of 𝑁 previous days [ 21 ]. Fig. 10 compares the out-of- sample performance of kNN-based models that estimate ramp require- ments relative to the unconditional method for February 2020, which are trained with data starting in January 2020. We use the probability of FRP shortage to assess the reliability levels of the FRP requirements, which measures the frequency of actual net load forecast errors exceed- ing the FRP requirements during the evaluated period. The amounts of oversupply are calculated by summing up excess FRP requirements over actual net load forecast errors over the evaluated period, and are used to measure the economic performance. 3 The ﬁgure displays trade-oﬀs be- tween reliability levels and oversupplies in the form of Pareto frontiers 3 Speciﬁcally, “oversupply ”for any particular 15 minute real-time market in- terval is measured by the amount that the FRU requirement procured in interval 7 B.F.

Pareto diagram showing performance of two sets of kNN-based machine learning requirements for FRU for February 2020, based on probabilistic solar forecasting data from each of ﬁve solar production sites in the CAISO in January 2020. Performance is compared to the CAISO baseline histogram method, which is not conditioned on weather. The markets rep- resent performance under alternative estimations from more conservative (upper left, showing more require- ments and lower likelihood of reserve shortage, re- sulting from using larger validation sets, starting from N = 30 previous days at the extreme upper left) to less conservative (lower right, resulting from using smaller validation sets, starting from N = 5 at the extreme lower point). for the case of 2-dimensional classiﬁers as we vary the size of validation sets. The circular point in Fig. 10 represents the baseline set of require- ments using the CAISO’s unconditional histogram method. Points lying to the southwest of the baseline indicate improvements (reductions) in both shortage of reserves (an index of reliability, y axis) and oversup- ply of FRP (x axis), hence these are better solutions than the original implementation. The colored lines represent the performance of two machine-learning based models derived from data from either one or ﬁve solar production sites in the CAISO. A set of points results from ad- justing the parameters of each model to yield more (upper left) to less (lower right) conservative requirements. By “conservative ”, we mean larger MW ﬂexible ramp-up requirements and therefore lower probabil- ity of actual ramp errors lying outside the requirement, but higher ramp product procurement cost. In Fig. 10 , most of the kNN points fall southwest of the baseline method, suggesting that the solar forecasting-based method can both reduce average procurement requirements while improving average re- liability levels. Therefore, the user can tune the method to emphasize ei- ther FRP oversupply reduction or reliability improvements. For instance, the ﬁgure shows that the best of the two Pareto curves (Site 2) can re- duce FRP oversupply to meet the present reliability performance (just under 8%, as shown on the x axis) by a ﬁfth (from 325 to 250 MW, the diﬀerence between the baseline and the orange curve, measured at 8% reliability). Alternatively, oversupply could be maintained at about 320 MW while reducing the frequency of reserve shortage from 8% to 6%. Ultimately the solar forecast-based requirements used in the simula- tions of the next section consisted of the kNN results based on the lat- est weather information. To select the optimal parameters for the kNN- based method–i.e., classiﬁers and the number of nearest neighbours–we designed a multi-objective optimization algorithm to dynamically select the parameters [ 21 ]. Fig. 11 gives an example of a set of FRU (left) and FRD (up) require- ments for the CAISO resulting from this method (blue) that were used in the simulation of the next section, contrasting them to the FRU and FRD requirements respectively based upon the CAISO baseline unconditional histogram method (red) (downloaded from [ 22 ]). By deﬁnition, the re- quirements diﬀered only during daylight hours, because those are the only times with solar forecast information. The results show that for this [t,t + 15] (dot at end of ﬁrst upper dashed line, Fig. 1 ) is in excess of the amount actually needed to meet the binding interval net load forecast in the following interval [t + 15,t + 30]. particular day, the solar-informed method increases ramp up require- ments relative to the baseline, especially during late afternoon hours, in order to enhance system reliability, while ramp down requirements are reduced through most of the day. This suggests that the probabilistic solar forecasts are consistent with greater risks of decreased solar pro- duction later in the day, but show smaller than typical risks of increased production throughout daylight hours. We next describe our analysis of the implications of these changed requirements for system production costs and FRP procurement costs. 4. Production cost assessment of beneﬁts of solar forecast-based ﬂexible ramp product requirements Our simulation of the beneﬁts of solar-conditioned FRP requirements considered the IEEE 118-bus reliability test system [ 23,24 ] with alter- ations to reﬂect California ISO generation mix and demand conditions. In this application, we used requirements developed using the kNN method of Section 3.3 . The size of the modiﬁed 118-bus system is ap- proximately one-tenth of the CAISO in terms of load, and was altered to reﬂect 2017 renewable penetration (solar penetration of 1.2 GW, pro- viding about 10% of the system’s annual energy). The test system also in- cluded steam units (0.9 GW), combustion turbines (1.8 GW), combined cycle plants (2.4 GW), hydro plants (1 GW), and wind (0.6 GW). The de- tailed generator and network data can be found at https://github.com/ NREL/FESTIV _ MODEL/tree/master/Input/SF2 _ JHUprime _ input/ . Loca- tions of wind and solar facilities in the 118-bus system are shown in Fig. 12 . Wind and solar capacity factors are based on CAISO data. Due to data and high-performance computing facility availability, we focused on operations during a few selected days (March 9-30, 2020). We considered three scenarios in this analysis to identify the bene- ﬁts of better FRP requirements. Scenario 1 is the ‘baseline’ simulation that is based the current unconditional FRP methodology, using avail- able historical data on ramp requirements from the CAISO (e.g., red lines, Fig. 11 ). Scenario 2 is the ‘conditional FRP’ scenario in which FRP requirements are updated based on the kNN method summarized in Section 3.3 to develop more eﬃcient ramping requirements based on probabilistic solar power forecasts (e.g., blue lines, Fig. 11 ). The diﬀer- ences in production costs between Scenarios 1 and 2 describe the impact of using solar-conditioned FRP. Scenario 3 is the ‘perfect’ forecast sce- nario which models system operations if the operator has perfect knowl- edge of the system (i.e., zero netload forecast errors). The diﬀerence be- tween Scenario 3 and any of the other scenarios’ production cost gives a quantitative measure of “uncertainty induced ”costs. Those are the in- creases in costs that occur under uncertainty, which are the expenses of 8 B.F. Hobbs, J. Zhang, H.F. Hamann et al. Solar Energy Advances 2 (2022) 100024 Fig. 11.

The spatial representation of the 118-bus system is based on Fig. 1 of Ref. [ 25 ]. generation commitment and dispatch changes to procure ramp product and to adjust resource schedules to correct for forecast errors, including unexpected real-time generation costs that occur if not enough ramp is available to meet actual needs. In addition, if system reliability (as measured, for instance, by ex- pected unserved load) diﬀers among the scenarios, this is also captured in the production costs, which include the value of lost load in the model’s objective function. However, in all our simulations, there was no unserved demand, so the diﬀerent FRP requirements in Scenarios 1 and 2 did not aﬀect reliability. All the analysis was performed using the FESTIV (Flexible Energy Scheduling Tool for Integrating Variable generation) [ 26 ] FESTIV is a production cost model that commits and dispatches day-ahead and real- time energy, procures reserves and ramp product, and simulates forecast errors between day-ahead and real-time, as well as real-time forecast errors that occur in the rolling real-time market processes. Fig. 13. Distribution of production cost reductions from using solar forecast- conditioned FRP requirements for 22 sample days in March 2020 compared to the CAISO baseline method, based upon 118-bus IEEE RTS ‘CAISO-like ”system Table 1 shows that the FRP requirements based on probabilistic so- lar forecasts (Scenario 2) are highly successful, reducing uncertainty- related costs by almost 90% (from $443K to $48k) in a 22-day period in March 2020. Most of these beneﬁts occurred in a one-week period mid- month ( Fig. 13 ). Use of those requirements decreased production costs by about 2% of total operating costs. Since actual energy and operating reserve costs of the CAISO system amount to about $8 billion/year, as noted above, if extrapolated to an entire system the size of the CAISO for one year, the savings would amount to over $100 million. However, such an extrapolation is only suggestive of the beneﬁts of FRP, because results may be very diﬀerent in other months and for a larger system. We now examine the simulation results in detail to identify how the solar-informed FRP requirements of Scenario 2 improved system oper- ations. A large share of the beneﬁts of the solar-conditioned method (Scenario 2) arose in this case due to reduced FRP requirements for some intervals, leading to reduced commitment of conventional gener- 9 B.F. Hobbs, J. Zhang, H.F. Hamann et al. Solar Energy Advances 2 (2022) 100024 Fig. 14. Real-time dispatch of four impacted generators on March 16, 2020, under baseline FRP requirements (Scenario 1, left) and solar conditioned requirements (Scenario 2, right), illustrating that insuﬃcient FRP-up in baseline case resulted in inadequate headroom in inter- vals two and three, necessitating real-time com- mitment of a costly ﬁfth large generator in the fourth interval (time 19.75). ation and turning oﬀ of large generators with spinning capacity. This enabled the system to accommodate more solar output and reduce curtailment. Fig. 14 illustrates this impact by comparing the dispatch of four par- ticular thermal generators in the evening of March 16, 2020, under Scenario 1 (baseline unconditional FRP requirements) and Scenario 2 (solar-uncertainty conditioned FRP requirements) (left and right sides of ﬁgure, respectively). The blue areas are the real-time energy produc- tion, and the orange areas are the “head room ”that can accommodate unexpected upward ramps in the net load. The baseline scenario (left) has relatively low evening FRU requirements, so the day-ahead mar- ket believes that it has suﬃcient excess undispatched capacity on-line to meet the solar to thermal handoﬀ in the evening. In real-time, how- ever, the ramp-up turned out to be higher than expected (for instance, due to less solar output than expected), and this was reﬂected in the small amounts of “head room ”(orange areas) in the second and third 15-minute intervals in the left side of Fig. 14 . When this happened, the real-time market detected that available capacity was depleted in those intervals, and so a larger (ﬁfth) generator was then committed in the real-time market’s short-term unit commitment procedure. As a result, the four generators back down slightly in the fourth and ﬁfth inter- vals to accommodate the minimum operating capability of the newly committed generator. By contrast, the larger FRU requirements in the solar-conditioned ramp scenario (Scenario 2) calculations (e.g., Fig. 11 ) force commitment in the day-ahead market of an additional smaller generator outside of the set of four generators considered in Fig. 14 . This additional commitment leaves suﬃcient headroom to accommo- date the larger than expected up-ramp in net load in real-time. The ex- tra headroom shown as the orange areas in the second and third in- tervals in the right-side ﬁgure eliminate the need to commit the larger (ﬁfth) generator we committed in the baseline scenario (Scenario 1). The result is signiﬁcant cost-savings, as shown above for this day in Fig. 13 . The solar-conditioned FRP requirements also provided other beneﬁts by providing more capacity in some other intervals by procuring more FRP and avoiding generation scarcity, particularly during the evening ramping intervals as solar production tapered oﬀ. In some days, smaller generators were committed by the day-ahead model, which turned out to yield a lower minimum thermal production (in particular, a lower sum of Pmin levels for on-line generators) (e.g., Fig. 15 ). This allowed the system to deploy rather than curtail solar production in some hours, saving production costs. We note that systems of diﬀerent sizes or with more or less genera- tion ﬂexibility could change the above quantitative conclusions. Also, the results for winter or summer conditions in the CAISO might be quantitatively diﬀerent. However, we conjecture that the qualitative im- provements seen by the use of solar conditioned FRP requirements are likely to still apply; this should be conﬁrmed by future research. Fig. 15. Actual dispatch of all thermal generation in “CAISO-like ” IEEE 118- bus system under baseline (unconditional) FRP requirements (red) and solar conditional requirements (blue). The reduced thermal production in the solar conditioned case indicates that the system can accommodate increased utiliza- tion (reduced curtailment) of solar output. 5. Conclusions As solar and wind capacity is added to power systems, the need for —and cost of —operating reserves grows. Furthermore, it is reason- able to expect that the potential beneﬁts of conditioning reserve require- ments on weather and, especially, solar and wind operating conditions will increase as well. In this paper, we have used probabilistic solar forecasts from the probabilistic Watt-Sun forecasting system to create solar-conditioned requirements for the California Independent System Operator’s newest type of operating reserves, called the ﬂexible ramp product. We provide details on two methods to relate solar forecast uncer- tainty (prediction interval width) to upward and downward uncertainty in 15-minute ramps: quantile regression and a k th -nearest neighbor- based methodology. Based on the 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentiles of the re- sulting solar-adjusted conditional probability distributions of ramp un- certainty, we can deﬁne requirements for the ﬂexible ramp product. Us- ing the k th -nearest neighbor-based requirements, we then estimate the economic and reliability beneﬁts from using those requirements rather than the CAISO baseline (unconditional histogram system) method. This is done by production costing simulations of a modiﬁed 118-bus IEEE Reliability Test System, whose generator mix characteristics and load shapes resemble the California system. Those simulations indicate a po- tential production cost reduction of 2% for this system from using solar 10 B.F. Hobbs, J. Zhang, H.F. Hamann et al.
