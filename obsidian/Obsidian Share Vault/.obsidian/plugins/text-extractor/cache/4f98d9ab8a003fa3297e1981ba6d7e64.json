Liandrat, N. Schmutz Reuniwatt, 14 rue de la Guadeloupe, 97490 Sainte-Clotilde, Reunion Island, France ABSTRACT Surface solar radiation forecasting permits to predict photovoltaic plant production for a massive and safe integration of solar energy into the electric network. For short-term forecasts (intra-day), methods using images from meteorological geostationary satellites are more suitable than numerical weather prediction models. Forecast schemes consist in assessing cloud motion vectors and in extrapolating cloud patterns from a given satellite image in order to predict cloud cover state above a PV plant. Atmospheric motion vectors retrieval techniques have been studied for several decades in order to improve weather forecasts. However, solar energy forecasting requires the extraction of cloud motion vectors on a finer spatial- and time-resolution than those provided for weather forecast applications. Even if motion vector retrieval is a wide research field in image processing related topics, only block-matching techniques are operationally used for solar energy forecasts via satellite images. In this paper, we propose two motion vectors extraction methods originating from video compression techniques (correlation phase and optical flow methods). We implemented them on a 6-day dataset of Meteosat-10 satellite diurnal images. We proceeded to cloud pattern extrapolation and compared predicted cloud maps against actual ones at different time horizons from 15 minutes to 4 hours ahead. Forecast scores were compared to the state-of-the-art (block matching) method. Correlation phase methods do not outperform block-matching but their computation time is about 25 times shorter. Optical flow based method outperforms all the methods with a satisfactory time computing. Keywords: solar energy, cloud, forecasting, Meteosat, motion vector, optical-flow, correlation phase, block-matching 1. INTRODUCTION Photovoltaic (PV) power production relies on solar irradiance reaching solar panels: it makes it highly dependable on the weather and its intensity significantly varies with cloud cover optical thickness. This intermittency presents an impediment to the massive injection of photovoltaics into electricity grids. Indeed, the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources is voluntarily limited so as to maintain network stability: to deliver a guaranteed electricity, power production must equal power consumption at all times. This essential precaution unfortunately means that part of a clean and renewable energy is lost to fossil energy. The most appropriate solution to turn PV from an intermittent energy into a guaranteed one is solar power forecasting. Giving predictions to PV plant managers and electricity grid operators, helps them better plan their solar storage and their use of other energies. The integration of PV into the grid is therefore eased and optimized [1]. *sylvain.cros@reuniwatt.com; phone +262 262921010; fax +262 262921020; www.reuniwatt.com Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XIX; and Optics in Atmospheric Propagation and Adaptive Systems XVII, edited by Adolfo Comerón, Evgueni I.

At the intra-day horizon, the stochasticity of cloud cover behavior cannot be accurately predicted with traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Cloud cover must be directly observed. All-sky cameras permit to observe, from the ground, the celestial vault with a hemispheric angle. Cloud velocity can then be derived from time-series of images acquired with such instruments, leading to an intra-hour irradiance forecast horizon above a punctual site [2]. However, forecasts at the intra-day horizon require cloud cover observation at meso-scale with a high temporal resolution. Therefore, observation through a geostationary meteorological satellite is the most suitable solution, providing irradiance predictions with a better accuracy than NWP in a time horizon smaller than 6 hours [3]. In this approach, cloud patterns are detected through the use of images from visible channels of such satellites. The cloud index (assumed to be proportional to cloud optical depth) can be calculated accurately from the reflectance measured by the sensor. Cloud index extraction is a mature approach that has been used extensively in solar resource mapping from visible channels of geostationary meteorological satellites [4], [5],[6],[7]. Then, cloud motion vectors can be determined from two subsequent cloud index maps, assuming cloud features do not change between two images. Vector fields are used to extrapolate future cloud patterns from current cloud index maps. Solar irradiance forecasts are then derived by combining predicted cloud index maps with modeled clear sky irradiance. Cloud motion vectors derivation from satellite images was originally used for meteorology, operational weather forecasts and cyclonic system monitoring. [8] give an overview of cloud tracking methods from satellite imagery from pioneering work to the present state-of-the-art. [9] focus on a complete comparative study of atmospheric motion vector retrieval from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite. These methods combine information from visible and infrared channels. However, cloud motion vectors for solar energy require the use of the highest space- and time-resolutions. Then, we focused only on methods using visible channels, because these latter present the highest spatial resolution, whatever the geostationary meteorological satellite currently available. The first publication reporting a solar irradiance forecast method by this mean was from [10] in 2001. The method focuses on the spatial correlation of cloud albedo between subsequent raw images. A few years after, researchers from Oldenburg university investigated the topic [11]. These works led to an operational method based on a block-matching algorithm using cloud index maps derived from MSG images [12}. This method constitutes the current state-of-the-art and the reference method for our work. It is hereafter called the block-matching method. It is the most famous and certainly the only one used for operational solar irradiance forecasts from meteorological geostationary satellite images. The motion vector extraction technique has been a central issue for video compression since the 1990's. As a video stream is often composed of subsequent images presenting similarities, motion vectors applied to an image permit to synthesize the next subsequent images without storing them. Compression techniques developed from the early 2000's offer a wide range of motion vector extraction algorithms than can be classified in three main methods [13]: block-matching, phase correlation and optical-flow. Considering this classification, the method of [12] is clearly assimilated to the block-matching one. The purpose of this paper is to propose an application of the correlation phase and of an optical-flow algorithms to retrieve cloud motion vector from geostationary meteorological satellites for solar energy forecasting. The performance of each algorithm is assessed by comparing the forecast cloud index maps with the actual ones. Section 2 describes the cloud index and data as well as the candidate algorithms for our benchmark. The comparison protocol and the results are presented in section 3. The conclusions and perspectives are listed in section 4. 2. CLOUD MOTION VECTOR EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS 2.1 Cloud index retrieval from Meteosat Second Generation images Operational from 2004, MSG is a series of geostationary meteorological satellites covering almost one third of the Earth surface including Europe, Africa and Atlantic Ocean (figure 1). The current satellite is Meteosat-10. Its sensor has 12 channels from visible to thermal infrared spectra. The High Resolution Visible (HRV) channel permits to acquire broadband images every 15 min. at a spatial resolution of 1 km at nadir – about 1.2 * 2.2 km at European latitudes. The MSG sensor is today one of the most accurate solutions for cloud cover imagery at high temporal resolution.

Source: Eumetsat Apart from meteorology and weather forecasting applications, such MSG images are currently used by several institutions for a real-time mapping of the surface solar irradiation (SSI). This parameter is the quantity of solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth. Its knowledge is of primary importance for PV production assessments. Solar irradiance extinction from the top of the atmosphere to the ground level is essentially driven – in the visible spectra - by aerosols, water vapor, ozone and obviously clouds. Proven methods such as Heliosat algorithms [4] permit to model atmospheric transmittance from MSG images. The principles consist in using clear sky models [14][15][16] to compute the SSI under a clear sky (cloud-free situation). Then, for cloudy pixels, the Heliosat method derives a so-called cloud index computed from the reflectance difference between a pixel at a given time and the same pixel when this one appears as totally clear. In other words, the cloud index is computed from the difference between top of atmosphere reflectance and the ground reflectance of a same pixel. The cloud index is a value ranging from 0 (clear sky) to 1 (overcast sky). [12] use cloud index images to forecast solar irradiance. Contrary to raw MSG images, cloud index maps do not show continental surfaces. Moreover, pixel brightness does not depend on the solar elevation angle. Finally, the pixel value of cloud index maps depends only on cloud properties. Cloud cover forecasts are therefore not biased by intra-day solar illumination variations. In the present work, we converted a MSG dataset into cloud index maps using Heliosat-II algorithms [4]. This method is known for its robustness and its proven quality for such images. It has been used to build HelioClim, a long-term solar radiation database widely used since 2004 [5]. 2.2 The block-matching algorithm To derive cloud motion vectors, cloud structures in consecutive images are identified, assuming that cloud structures of a certain spatial scale and pixel intensities are stable for the considered short-term time-scales. Practically, corresponding regions are identified in two subsequent images. The assumption of constant pixel intensities leads to: n1 (⃗x0+((t1−t 0 )⃗v (⃗x0)))≈n0 (⃗x0) (1) with a vector v describing the motion, where ni is the cloud index at position x and the image at time t. The past image is subscribed with 0, the actual image with 1. As a first step in this analysis, rectangular regions are defined which should be both large enough to contain information on temporally stable cloud structures, and small enough so that the same vector describes the motion for the whole region. In the next step, the mean square pixel differences between rectangular Proc. of SPIE Vol. 9242 924202-3 Downloaded From: http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/ on 05/19/2015 Terms of Use: http://spiedl.org/terms regions in the consecutive images are calculated for displacements in all directions. The maximum displacement considered is defined by maximum wind speeds at typical cloud heights. Finally, the motion vector is determined by the displacement that yields the minimum mean square pixel differences (mse): mse= 1 N ∑ i=1 n [n1 (⃗xi +(t 1−t0 )⃗v (⃗xi))−n0 (⃗xi )]² (2) The size of the region to determine the mean square pixel differences should be large enough to contain information on cloud structures. Best results were achieved for regions with a size of 110*110 km 2 (90*50 pixels in Western Europe). Further extension of the regions does not influence the forecast quality significantly and increases uselessly time computing. The last parameter is the resolution of the vector field. The distance between vectors was chosen at 43 km. These parameters have been empirically determined. Due to the varying spatial resolution of MSG image in function of latitude and longitude, these parameters must be changed for other parts of the MSG field of view. 2.3 The correlation phase algorithm This algorithm exploits the fact that translation in the spatial domain has its counterpart in the frequency domain. The original Phase Correlation image alignment method [17] was designed for measuring the relative displacement between images. Consider two (infinite) images f1 and f2, and let f2 be a replica of f1, shifted over d = (dx , dy ), such that f2(X) = f1(X - d). Then, according to the Fourier shift theorem, their Fourier transforms are related by: G1( f )=G 2( f ) . e − j2 π ⃗f. ⃗d (3) Calculating the cross-power spectrum and extracting its phase gives: e jΦ (⃗f )=e − j2π (⃗f . ⃗d ) (4) from which it follows that the phase correlation function, p(x), is a delta-function located at the point of registration: p (⃗x )=δ (⃗x−⃗d ) (5) In the practical case of finite images, even when the overlap between the images is small, the delta-function is replaced by a correlation surface, which is characterized by a narrow peak at the point of registration and lower amplitude peaks at other locations. The resulting correlation measure is relatively scene-independent and not confused by brightness changes in the scene, or noise. Large shifts can be measured with a high accuracy. The Phase Correlation method as described above can only be used for measuring global motion, but a two-stage method has been proposed to be able to measure the movements of multiple objects in a scene. First, on fairly large blocks, a limited number of candidate vectors are calculated using a phase correlation step; then, for smaller blocks, one of these candidate vectors is selected using a block matching criterion. In the first stage, the input picture is divided into fairly large blocks, typically 64 pixels square. The dimensions of these blocks must be at least twice the size of the largest movement that can be measured, to make sure there is enough overlap between the image material in corresponding blocks. The phase correlation function (5) is calculated for corresponding blocks in two successive images, resulting in a correlation surface for each block in the image. Each correlation surface is searched for a small number of dominant peaks, which are the candidate vectors for the second stage. The highest peaks in the correlation surface are the result of the motion of objects in the block, and the relative height of the peaks reflects the relative size of the objects. Candidate vectors with a sub-pixel accuracy can be estimated by interpolating the correlation surface. In the second stage, each of the large blocks are divided into smaller blocks, typically 8 pixels square. The small blocks from the current image are shifted over each candidate vector from the phase correlation step, and the match error with Proc. of SPIE Vol. 9242 924202-4 Downloaded From: http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/ on 05/19/2015 Terms of Use: http://spiedl.org/terms the previous image is calculated. The vector with the lowest match error is assigned to each block. A simple and popular match error function is the Summed Absolute Difference (SAD) criterion [18]: SAF ( ⃗X , ⃗d )=∑ ( f 2 (⃗x )=f 1 (⃗x−⃗d )) (6) where SAD is the match error, X is the center of the current small block, d is the displacement vector under evaluation, f1(x) and f2(x) are respectively the cloud index values at position x in the current image and in the previous image. The position x is included in the current small block centered in X. To improve the result, candidate vectors from surrounding blocks might be included. Thus, the Phase Correlation method is similar to the full search block matching algorithm, except that the number of candidate displacements is limited to those resulting from the phase correlation process. This allows the number of candidate vectors to be kept low, while still enabling large displacements to be measured accurately [19]. 2.4 Optical flow estimation: the Lucas-Kanade Algorithm Optical flow is a general notion of image processing designating the detection of object motions on subsequent images. Optical flow algorithms particularly refer to methods detecting a motion using image gradient. By definition, they permit to obtain dense motion vector fields (one vector per pixel). Optical flow principles are based on the following assumption: the brightness variation of pixels is only due to the translation of the elements in the observed scene. This assumption can be translated by the following equation: ∂ I ∂ x . u+ ∂ I ∂ y . v+ ∂ I ∂ t =0 (7) where I denotes the pixel brightness, x and y the pixel position, u and v the motion vector components. As this equation presents two unknown variables, then u and v cannot be determined; this is known as the optical flow algorithms’ aperture problem. Solving this issue generally involves the addition of smoothing constraints on the optical flow or its gradient. In other words, particular solutions of equation (7) must be determined. Several methods propose an answer to the aperture problem. The method of Lucas-Kanade [20] is a local approach. It consists in considering that brightness conservation assumption is valid for a spatial neighborhood Ω. For each space to consider, one must minimize the following function: ∑ i,jϵ Ω [ I x (i,j )u(i,j )+I y (i,j )v (i,j )+I t (i,j)]²=∑ ((∇ I ) t V+I t ) 2 (8) Equation (8) often leads to an over-determined system. Considering equation (8) under the form : AV=B (9) with matrices A and B: A=( I x ( p1) I y ( p1) I x ( p2 ) I y ( p2) . .. . . . I x ( pn) I y ( pn)) (10) Proc. of SPIE Vol. 9242 924202-5 Downloaded From: http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/ on 05/19/2015 Terms of Use: http://spiedl.org/terms B=( −I t ( p1) −I t ( p2 ) .. . −I t ( pn)) (11) p1, p2, …, pn are the n pixels included in Ω. Let W a Gaussian window. A least-square estimation leads to : V= (A T A ) −1 AT B (12) Assuming brightness conservation in the neighborhood, a given block of pixels is weighted by W, a Gaussian window. Finally V is computed by: V= (A T WA ) −1 AT WB (13) 3. CLOUD INDEX FORECAST BENCHMARK 3.1 Cloud index forecast and assessment protocol An objective manner to assess the performance of each method consists in performing cloud index forecasts by applying the three different motion vector fields obtained. We used a 6-day time-series of MSG (Meteosat-10) images, from the 1st to the 6th June 2014. The retained area covers western France and northern Spain (figure 2). The Heliosat-II algorithm is only valid if, over a given pixel, the sun elevation angle is above 15°. Therefore we only selected images taken between 900 and 1600 UTC. Considering a time t0 we produced the cloud motion vector field with cloud index images taken at t 0 – 15 min. and t0. We then extrapolated the image at t0 according to vector components to produce a forecast every 15 min. Finally, following [11], a spatial smoothing filter was applied to the extrapolated maps, increasing the cloud index forecasts accuracy. Forecasts have been produced from every available image. Time horizon was limited to 4 hours. Forecasts launched less than 4 hours before 1600 had a time horizon limited to 1600. Comparison between predicted and actual cloud maps have been performed for each time horizon. We computed root median square error (RMSE) at each time horizon; we compared the score issued from the three different motion vector extraction methods to a persistence algorithm. Persistence is a naive forecast algorithm considering that a cloud index map stays constant from T0 until the end of the time horizon.

Figure 5: Cloud index map with cloud motion vectors field from the Optical Flow / Lucas-Kanade algorithm. We can remark than global motion appears very similar between the three algorithms. Lucas-Kanade methods produced a relative smoother vector field. Phase correlation method present smaller vectors over homogeneous zone. Indeed, over such areas, frequency domain contain less information than areas with strong spatial gradients. Finally, block-matching algorithm tends to overestimate small cloud structure motion, leading to aberrant vectors inside a smooth field. Figure 6 shows the evolution of RMSE for each forecast algorithm, in function of time horizon values. We can clearly see that all three algorithms present a similar performance. The gap with the persistence algorithm increases with the time horizon. The Lucas-Kanade algorithm shows a slightly better performance, when phase correlation does not really Proc. of SPIE Vol. 9242 924202-8 Downloaded From: http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/ on 05/19/2015 Terms of Use: http://spiedl.org/terms overcome the state-of-the-art (block-matching). In terms of operational performance, phase correlation produces a motion vector field 25 times faster than block-matching and about 5 times faster than the Lucas-Kanade algorithm.

CONCLUSION In this paper, we implemented three different cloud motion vectors extraction algorithms for solar irradiance forecasting using meteorological geostationary satellite visible channel images. We used proven methods from video compression processing techniques and defined an application for satellite images. We computed predicted cloud index maps and compared them to state-of-the-art and persistence algorithms. Loss in accuracy compared to the existing method remains small but a real progress in time computing has been highlighted. Further work must be undertaken concerning optical flow methods. The solving of the aperture problem generated several methods than can be implemented for cloud cover behavior forecasting. Finally, conclusive works must be undertaken by comparing solar irradiance derived from these cloud index maps against ground measurements.
