They demonize transgender students and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and insist on abolishing the Department of Education. These are at best distractions and don’t get to the heart of the matter: Most parents are dissatisfied with public schools. Republicans have nothing constructive to say about that. Today at 7:45 a.m. EST \u0000e Education Department in Washington.

The Post recently explained: It administers federal grant programs, including the $18.4 billion Title I program that provides supplemental funding to high-poverty K-12 schools, as well as the $15.5 billion program that helps cover the cost of education for students with disabilities. The department oversees the $1.6 trillion federal student loan program and sets rules for what colleges must do to participate. It also runs achievement tests dubbed the Nation’s Report Card and collects statistics on enrollment, crime in school, staffing and other topics. And the agency is charged with enforcing civil rights laws that bar discrimination in federally funded schools on the basis of race, sex and other factors. Other than eliminating funding for schools (or having some other part of government administer funding), depriving disabled kids access to schools and shutting down a useful source of data on research and school reform, abolishing the department would not change 12/16/24, 8:35 PM Opinion | Dems must do more than save the Education Department - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/8 much. It certainly would not improve the quality of education. Democrats make a mistake in following Republicans to debate the existence of a federal department. Frankly, most Americans do not know what the department does anyway and can easily be convinced that there is “waste” or “bureaucracy” that could be eliminated. Follow Jennifer Rubin Instead, Democrats would be wise to listen to parents. A Gallup poll released in August found that although satisfaction rose slightly from 2023, “Currently, 9% of Americans say they are completely satisfied with the quality of education U.S. students in kindergarten through grade 12 receive, and 34% are somewhat satisfied. Conversely, 21% are completely dissatisfied and 34% somewhat dissatisfied.” Other polling confirms the dissatisfaction. Data for Progress, a progressive think tank, recently found that 62 percent of likely voters, including 55 percent of parents of under-18 children and 58 percent of households with a K-12 teacher or administrator, “believe the K-12 education system is going in the wrong direction.” The dissatisfaction is bipartisan: “50% of Democrats, 66% of Independents, and 70% of Republicans share this sentiment.” 12/16/24, 8:35 PM Opinion | Dems must do more than save the Education Department - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 3/8 And they do not think eliminating the Education Department would help. (“53% of voters, including 75% of Democrats, 57% of Independents, and 31% of Republicans, oppose this action. Voters from teacher households and parents of a child under 18 also oppose eliminating the department by a -13-point and -5-point margin, respectively.”) Given a choice between too much “wokeness” and too little funding, only Republicans think the former is more to blame for the state of things (55 percent to 35 percent); voters generally (52 percent), including independents (53 percent), cite lack of resources. A substantial percentage of parents do harbor concerns about learning loss caused by the pandemic. “Overall in math, a subject where learning loss has been greatest, students have made up about a third of what they lost,” the New York Times reported in January. “In reading, they have made up a quarter, according to the new analysis of standardized test score data led by researchers at Stanford and Harvard.” Moreover, a giant $122 billion federal aid package expired the previous September. Without the “single largest federal investment in public education in the country’s history [which] paid for extra help, like tutoring and 12/16/24, 8:35 PM Opinion | Dems must do more than save the Education Department - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 4/8 summer school, at schools nationwide,” students will continue to struggle. Republicans often insist that “throwing more money at the problem” won’t fix it. But the correlation between school success and spending is strong. Of the top 10 states in school performance (Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Washington, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Minnesota, Connecticut, Virginia, Wisconsin), six are in the top 10 (with Washington at 11th) for resources. (Different surveys have slightly different rankings, but these schools generally are at the top.) It’s no coincidence that eight of the top 10 have Democratic governors, who have made education a clear focus. Massachusetts, New Jersey and Minnesota, for example, have worked to implement adequate funding for at- risk schools, expanded access to prekindergarten, free school lunch programs and improved teacher pay. Governors should tout their gains. Democrats nationally should not make education a fight over a government department but rather about who cares about Americans’ kids. Three related arguments would help them focus on parents’ real concerns. First, explaining that Republicans are trying to “cut money for schools to give billionaires a tax break” helps reorient the argument to 12/16/24, 8:35 PM Opinion | Dems must do more than save the Education Department - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 5/8 Democrats’ larger, more important narrative about taking from ordinary Americans to enrich the super-rich. Plenty of polling shows voters dislike tax cuts for billionaires and think that not enough is being done for people “like them.” Education is one policy opportunity to reinforce that message. Second, Democrats should address parents’ anxiety that their kids have not recovered from covid learning loss. Studies show federal funding helped but, according to The Post, not enough: An additional $1,000 per student in federal funding translated into a gain of about 3 percent of a grade level of learning in math. For reading, the gains were similar in one study and a bit smaller in the other. These results are in line with what pre-pandemic studies found of earlier, more modest increases in education spending. This implies that giving a school district an extra $8,000 per student would have been enough to make up nearly half of the average math losses. That compares to average per- pupil spending of $13,187 in 2019, before the pandemic and the surge of federal dollars. “Not all of the money for academics was invested in the most effective strategies, because they had other priorities or perhaps were unaware of the research,” The Post continues. “Not every district got robust funding. And the losses were deep.” Democrats should insist that 12/16/24, 8:35 PM Opinion | Dems must do more than save the Education Department - The Washington Post chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 6/8 taxpayer money is used only for covid catch-up (which has not always been the case). Third, Democrats can advocate for kids’ safety by addressing the prevalence of guns and lack of mental health services while defending vaccine requirements that prevent childhood diseases. When some surveys show “70% of parents say they’re now more concerned about their child’s mental health than physical health,” and 44 percent still worry about physical safety, Democrats should champion all aspects of children’s health. If Republicans persist in cutting money for children to enrich billionaires, Democrats will have a golden opportunity to focus on parents’ real concerns and plutocratic MAGA economics.
