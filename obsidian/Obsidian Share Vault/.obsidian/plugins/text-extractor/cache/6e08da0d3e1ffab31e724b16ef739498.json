In either case, results to date suggest market reform will be requ ired to keep generators profitable and grids reliable. The traditional energy market vs. renewables Wholesale energy markets are compl ex, as pl anners constantly struggle to create market designs to incentivize generators to provide affordable electricity. Grid ope rators need to ensure that generation will be available today, tomorrow, and in the future, suppl ying both energy and critically needed balancing services. Different approaches to incentivizing generation US wholesale energy markets have different appr oaches to solving this problem. They're generally bifurcated into those that allocate payments for capa city—the physical capa bility to generate or \"steel in the ground\"—and those that don't. Some markets like PJM (the mid-Atlantic power po ol) hold capa city auctions three years ahead of time to establish annual values. These markets also cap wh olesale energy pr ices at $2,000—a result of the recent FERC Order 831. On the extreme oppo site end stands the Electric Reliability Council of Texas \u0000ERCOT\u0000, with its highly compe titive, restructured retail and wholesale markets. Instead of capa city payments, ERCOT has lifted its energy pr ice caps to $9,000 pe r MWh with the notion that higher po tential pr ices will lure new generation. While the concept makes sense, in just the pa st few years the entire energy landscape has tectonically shifted, owing to low-cost renewables and cheap ga s, jeopa rdizing the concept . The California Indepe ndent Systems Ope rator \u0000CAISO\u0000 has a limited compe titive retail power market, as well as a compe titive wholesale market, which is greatly affected by 8/1/24, 9:37 AM A tale of two ISOs: energy market design in Texas and California | GE Vernova chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 2/5 the activities of its three main utilities. CAISO has opt ed to broaden its energy market to include pa rts of the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, and Nevada. While it does not have a formal capa city auction, it does have a spe cific process to address resource adequ acy in the near term. Under this appr oach, CAISO is authorized to procure capa city in spe cific instances, with one-year agreements that do not involve pu blicly visible bidding. Grid operators in Texas and California struggle to address new challenges The recent infusion of renewables with low or even negative costs has created stresses for traditional market pa rticipa nts. For exampl e, due to the Federal Production Tax Credit that pays wind generators $24 pe r MWh, wind generators can sell below zero and generate a po sitive cash flow. A recent repo rt from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory states that variable renewable energy \u0000VRE\u0000 \"suppr esses wholesale energy pr ices while providing relatively little capa city. This effect becomes more pronounced the higher the VRE pe netration in a market.\" Because this pressure from renewables has been coupl ed with the arrival of fracking and cheap n atural gas, ERCOT and CAISO have seen pu nishingly low-pr iced electricity markets, with spo t pr ices languishing in the basement. According to ERCOT's Potomac Economics repo rt, average pr ices were just $24.62 in 2016. \u0000Loss-of-load and reliability adders contributed another modest 40 cents). The spo t market pr ice in 2016 never cleared $1,000, exceeding $300 for only 22 hours. Meanwhile, pr ices were negative for 133 hours. These pr ices are insufficient to bring in new generation. The Potomac Economics repo rt estimates that a new gas generator needs $80\u000095 pe r kW-year to \"satisfy annual fixed costs.\" This contrasts with the net revenues for existing gas units of $23\u000029 pe r kW-year. There is an ancillary market, as well, but 2016 pr ices were modest at best. These pr ices are not even sufficient to pay some existing generators. In fact, in the first two weeks of October, Luminant announced the pe nding retirement of three coal pl ants totaling 4,100 MW. 8/1/24, 9:37 AM A tale of two ISOs: energy market design in Texas and California | GE Vernova chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 3/5 Meanwhile, sun-drenched California has fared slightly better. According to CAISO, average pr ices for the most recent qu arter ranged from $23/MWh in March to about $34 in June. Limited short-term spikes reached $200 for a five-hour pe riod, and climbed as high as $600 for a single hour. This is, however, insufficient to attract new dispa tchable generation, even as renewable additions climb: CAISO repo rted a new solar pe ak of 9,914 MW in mid-June. This increase in solar exacerbates the infamous California duck curve by creating a greater surpl us of solar energy midday, resulting in some generators having two starts each day. With the rise of renewables, CAISO is now having to increase its focus on frequ ency regulation (both reg up a nd reg down). California's grid ope rator is now evaluating \"flexible resource adequ acy\" with varying lead times to ensure capa city will be qu ickly available when requ ired, according to CAISO. Generators will struggle for the foreseeable future What do these varying appr oaches and results to date impl y for generators looking to survive and thrive in these markets? They signal tough days ahead, irrespe ctive of whether capa city pr ices are included in the market structure. Capa city pr ices are helpf ul, but, at current levels and combined with energy pr ices, they are simpl y insufficient to justify new entrants. Ancillaries are also insufficient at present pr ices to ensure profitability for many pl ants. Existing generators will likely remain mired in a low-cost environment for years to come as even more low-cost renewables flood the market and natural gas pr ices remain muted. To survive, some pl ants may have to become even more flexible in order to access ancillary services markets—even with the modest ancillary pr ices seen today. Digitization of existing pl ants, combined with training focused on new ope rating regimes, will be critical in affecting this transition. 8/1/24, 9:37 AM A tale of two ISOs: energy market design in Texas and California | GE Vernova chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 4/5 TAKEAWAY Longer term, as more consolidation happe ns and more pa rticipa nts exit the market, it's po ssible that some sweeping fundamental changes in market rules may be necessary. The missing-money problem is simpl y becoming too large to ignore. Market designs must reflect current and future realities if they are to capa bly ensure resource adequ acy—and the necessary profitability for generators—in the years to come. 8/1/24, 9:37 AM A tale of two ISOs: energy market design in Texas and California | GE Vernova chrome-extension://mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle/src/ui/pages/editor.html 5/5","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
