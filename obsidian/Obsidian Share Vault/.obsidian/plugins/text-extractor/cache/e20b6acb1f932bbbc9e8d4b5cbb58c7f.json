The unemployment benefits process BASIc INfORMATION | PAGE 1 BASIc INfOR M ATION Words in bold italics are defined in the Definitions section in the Appendix section of this Handbook. What is Unemployment Insurance? Unemployment Insurance is a program that provides financial benefits for eligible unemployed workers to help you meet expenses while looking for a new job. Unemployment benefits replace part of your lost income and are not public assistance. Unemployment benefits are made possible through unemployment taxes paid by employers. Unemployment taxes are not withheld from employees’ paychecks. The Washington state Employment Security Department (ESD) has programs and services to • help you financially when you become unemployed due to no fault of your own and • assist you to return to work as quickly as possible. We are here to help you apply for unemployment benefits, submit weekly claims, improve your job search skills and look for work. Information needed to apply for benefits You will need to be prepared to provide the following information in order to apply for unemployment benefits: • Your complete work history for the past 18 months including: à employer name(s) à address(es) à phone number(s) à start and end dates of employment for each employer. • If you have worked in other states in the last 18 months, you need the state(s) where you physically worked and your employer’s payroll address. How long can you collect unemployment benefits? Your unemployment claim is considered to be open for one year. However, your actual benefits will generally last for six months (26 weeks). Your benefits may last longer than six months if you have deductible earnings BASIc INfORMATION | PAGE 2 from working or you are collecting retirement pay. If you run out of (exhaust) your benefits, you cannot apply for a new claim until your current claim expires (one year). Maintaining eligibility for benefits To maintain benefits, you must continue to meet the eligibility requirements for each week that you claim. Eligibility means: • being able to work • being available for work • actively seeking work and • keeping track of your job search by maintaining job search logs. Your job search logs may be reviewed at any time by ESD to ensure that you are meeting your job search requirements. BASIc INfORMATION | PAGE 3 Requalifying for benefits If you were paid unemployment benefits on a claim that is now expired, you must meet the following requirements to qualify for a new claim: 1. You must have worked at least 680 hours in the base year of your new claim. 2. You must have returned to work and earned six times your weekly benefit amount since the initial job separation and application date on your prior claim, but before the effective date of your new claim. These rules do not apply if you file a claim in Washington after exhausting benefits in another state or if you were not paid on the prior claim. Canceling a claim You can cancel your claim if you have not received any payments on the claim and it has not been more than 30 days since you applied for benefits. You will need to call the Claims Center at 800-318-6022 to request a claim cancellation. Once a claim is canceled, it cannot be reinstated. You would need to apply for a new claim to begin receiving benefits. Stop claiming once you start a full-time job Once you are hired full-time or earn at least your weekly benefit amount, you do not need to call us to tell us that you found work. But you must stop submitting weekly claims once you actually start your new job – not after you get your first paycheck. ELIGIBILITY | PAGE 4 ELIGIBILIT Y Are you eligible for benefits? There are a number of factors which ESD takes into consideration to determine who can receive benefits. We look at: 1. The number of hours you have worked in the past 12-18 months, to determine if you have the minimum 680 hours required in the base year (the time frame your claim’s maximum benefits amount will be based on). 2. The reason you were separated from your job: laid off, quit with good cause, terminated due to no fault of your own, or still working less than full-time. 3. If you are mentally and physically able to work, as well as available to work without restrictions that would prevent you from accepting work (for example: transportation issues, illness, vacations, or lack of family/child care). 4. If you are making an active, weekly job search to make sure you are looking for work in occupations that you are willing and able to work in. You must keep a log of your job search activities. 5. If you are legally authorized to work in the United States during your base year and the weeks you are claiming benefits. Covered and Non-covered employment Covered employment is a type of job for which your employer is required to pay into the unemployment tax trust fund. It is not a deduction from your paycheck. Non-covered employment includes such occupations as: 1. Self-employed workers 2. Elected government officials 3. Church employees 4. Appraisers 5. Amateur sports officials, like umpires and referees 6. Work-study students 7. Workers on some small fishing boats 8. Corporate officers 9. Workers paid based on commission ELIGIBILITY | PAGE 5 Federal employees You may be eligible for unemployment benefits in Washington state if: • You were a federal employee in the past 18 months, and • Your official duty station of your last federal employer was in Washington, or • You are a current Washington resident and you à Are a U.S. citizen and your official duty station was outside the U.S., or à Have worked in Washington after your last federal employer. For more information, go to https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/federal-employees. Educational employees The term “educational employees” includes anyone who works for any level of educational institution, including K-12 and higher education. This includes, but is not limited to, teachers, administrators, principals, librarians, bus drivers, custodians, and professors. Under federal law, educational employees are not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits during traditional break periods in situations where they have “reasonable assurance” that they will continue working after the break. However, if they do not have “reasonable assurance” that they will continue working after the break, then – depending on the situation – they may be eligible to use those wages for their unemployment benefit claim. There is a three-part “test” to determine whether educational employees may be able to use the wages for their unemployment benefit claim: • Test One: Does the situation meet the prerequisites? • Test Two: Is there a contract? • Test Three: Is there reasonable assurance? For more information, go to https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/ educational-employees. ELIGIBILITY | PAGE 6 Can you still work and receive benefits? If you are working less than full-time, you may still be eligible for part of your unemployment benefits. When you submit your weekly claim, you must report the number of hours you worked and the total gross wages (before any deductions) you earned for the work you did during that week, regardless of when you receive payment for the work done. This includes reporting any hours and earnings you receive if you work in non-covered employment. You must still be able and available to accept full-time work even though you are working part-time. You must also make an active search for full- time work (and keep track of those searches). ESD calculates the amount of your weekly benefits based on the hours and wages you report. You must accurately report this information and we verify the information you provide with your employer. If you knowingly provide incorrect information, you might have to pay back benefits and penalties on top of that. Temporary Total Disability (TTD) If you have been unable to work for 13 or more weeks in a row due to injury or illness, you may still be eligible for unemployment benefits. You must also meet the standard eligibility requirements for all unemployment claims. To file a TTD claim, you must be able to work, available for work, and: 1. Your disability date or time loss payment must have started within the last 6 years; and 2. A doctor must have released you for work within the last 12 months (released for light duty is allowed as long as you can work full time); or 3. Your workers’ compensation or crime victims’ compensation must have ended within the last 12 months. When should you contact the Claims Center to file your claim? 1. For Non-work related injury/illness: Apply for benefits during the week you are released for full time work. 2. For Work-related injury and illness: Apply for benefits the week after you are released to work or time-loss end date. ELIGIBILITY | PAGE 7 Note: Workers’ compensation is paid by Labor and Industries (L&I) or a private insurer due to an on-the-job injury, including back pay of wage replacement such as: time-loss, loss of earning power payments and adjustments. Let us know if you are appealing a decision to deny your workers’ compensation benefits. A TTD claim is based on wages and hours earned before your injury or illness as if you filed on that date. Send us a message through your eServices account or call the Claims Center at 800-318-6022. All claims that are filed online or by phone are reviewed thoroughly in order to offer you the best claim options. What would keep you from receiving unemployment benefits? Separation from employment ESD gathers information from both you and your employer(s) about the reason for your job separation. We need to determine if your job ended due to a layoff, if you quit for good cause, or if you were fired for reasons other than misconduct. If your job ended due to a layoff, which is defined as a lack of available work, benefits are generally allowed (unless there are other questions about your eligibility). A lack of work could be due to the business closing, seasonal changes or a business downturn. We may contact you by sending you a questionnaire by U.S. mail, through eServices, or using the phone number or email address you have provided. Based on the information you provide, a decision is made to either allow or deny your benefits if the separation is something other than a lack of work. If your job ended because you quit, the separation is reviewed to determine if it meets one of the following good cause reasons for quitting: 1. You took another job prior to leaving your current employer. 2. You or a family member became sick or disabled, or a death occurred in the family, and it became necessary for you to quit work. 3. You moved due to your spouse or registered domestic partner’s job that was out of your customary labor market. 4. You needed to resign as a result of domestic violence or stalking. ELIGIBILITY | PAGE 8 5. Your employer made a change to your hours or pay that resulted in a 25 percent or more reduction. 6. There was a safety problem at work that you reported but your employer did not address or fix the problem in a timely manner. 7. There was illegal activity at work that you reported but your employer did not address in a timely manner. 8. Your employer made a change in the usual work that goes against your sincere religious or moral beliefs. 9. You entered an approved apprenticeship training program. 10. You started, continued, or resumed an approved training program under the Trade Act. 11. You worked a full-time job and a part-time job at the same time, and chose to quit the part-time job. If you are denied benefits based on not having good cause for quitting your job, the denial continues until it has been seven weeks after the week you separated from the employer AND have earned at least seven times your weekly benefit amount in new covered employment. If your job ended because you were fired, the separation is reviewed to see if it was for misconduct, gross misconduct or no misconduct at all. Misconduct is doing something deliberately or carelessly when you knew or should have known it could cause harm to the employer’s business. Examples of misconduct are: 1. Repeated tardiness when you had been previously warned. 2. Insubordination. 3. Dishonesty related to employment. 4. Repeated and inexcusable absences. 5. Violations of law or deliberate acts that could provoke violence or illegal actions. 6. Violation of a company policy or rule. 7. Deliberate violation standards of behavior an employer has the right to expect from its employees. 8. Carelessness or negligence that causes or would likely cause serious bodily harm. 9. Carelessness or negligence of such a degree or frequency that it shows an intentional or substantial disregard for your employer’s interest. ELIGIBILITY | PAGE 9 Examples of gross misconduct include: 1. A criminal act in connection with your work for which you have been convicted in a criminal court or have admitted to committing. 2. Conduct connected with your work that demonstrates a flagrant and wanton disregard for your employer or a fellow employee. If you are denied benefits based on being fired for misconduct or gross misconduct, the denial continues until it has been ten weeks after the week you separated from the employer AND you have earned at least ten times your weekly benefit amount in new covered employment. If you are denied benefits due to gross misconduct, the wages and hours from that employer are removed from your claim. This could cause your claim to drop below the required 680 hours needed to establish a valid claim. If you did not work at least 680 hours for this employer, hours will be removed from other base year employers to total 680. Can you get benefits if you are on strike or affected by a lockout? This is determined on a case-by-case basis. You should apply for benefits and keep submitting your weekly claims while you are waiting for our decision. If you have earnings or strike pay, we may deduct a portion of them from your benefits. ELIGIBILITY | PAGE 10 Is there anything else that could keep you from receiving benefits? Once your claim is open, you must submit weekly claims to certify that you have met all the requirements for the week. If you do not file timely, a week could be denied. If you stop filing, and at a later date wish to reopen your claim to start filing again, you need to reopen your claim in the week that you want to start receiving benefits. If you are reporting untrue or inaccurate information (either intentionally or unintentionally) such as employment history, reasons you were separated from work, earnings (whether in covered or non-covered work), job search activities, or not being able or available to work, your benefits could be denied. ESD may request you attend an appointment with WorkSource. The letter will be sent by U.S. mail. If you fail to schedule or attend an appointment as required, we will contact you to find out why you did not attend. We may determine that the week of the appointment is disqualified, based on why you missed the appointment. Benefit Exclusions You DO NOT qualify for benefits if you are working full-time. This includes: 1. Working full-time on commission. 2. Working full-time, but earning less than your Weekly Benefit Amount. ELIGIBILITY | PAGE 11 What if your eligibility is in question for some reason? After you apply for unemployment benefits and submit a weekly claim, ESD determines if you are eligible for benefits. At any time during your claim, we may need additional information to make a revised decision. To gather the facts we need, we may: 1. Send you questionnaires by U.S. mail or through eServices. 2. Send you a message through eServices. 3. Call or email you. 4. Contact your former employer(s) to ask specific questions about why you are no longer working. 5. Contact other people who can provide relevant information. We make decisions based on information we have available. If ESD attempts to contact you, and you do not respond in a timely manner, a decision could be made that may result in your benefits being denied. If we have questions after you have already started receiving weekly benefits, we may pay you conditional payments until the questions are resolved. cREATING AN ONLINE ESD ESERvIcES AccOUNT | PAGE 12 cREATING AN ONLINE ESD ESERvIcES AccOUNT What is eServices? eServices is the Employment Security Department’s secure website for applying for unemployment benefits, submitting weekly claims and accessing information about your benefits.

WE TAKE fRAUD SERIOUSLY | PAGE 17 WE TAKE fR AUD SERIOUSLY Fraud is knowingly withholding information about a claim. It has serious consequences. Violators can face criminal prosecution. ESD’s team of investigators is solely focused on identifying fraud. Breaking the rules, such as intentionally failing to report correct work and earnings, could result in a denial of benefits, an overpayment, penalties and even criminal prosecution. Tips to avoid committing fraud Follow these tips to keep from committing fraud. While you collect unemployment, you are responsible for following the requirements in state law. Serious consequences, including penalties can result if you fail to: 1. Accurately report why you’re unemployed. Be sure to report the reason for leaving your job when you apply for unemployment benefits, reopen your claim or file a weekly claim. If you lie about the reason you lost your job, you will be guilty of fraud. 2. Report any wages you earn while you are receiving unemployment benefits. You must report your gross wages (before taxes) for each week you work, regardless of when you get paid. If you don’t, you are guilty of fraud. Report all earnings, including part-time work and temporary work. Avoid making mistakes so we can pay you correctly. Read and follow all of the information we give you. If you don’t understand something, please call the Claims Center at 800-318-6022 for clarification. WE TAKE fRAUD SERIOUSLY | PAGE 18 Penalties for unemployment benefits fraud You may be denied benefits if you knowingly break the rules and commit unemployment benefits fraud. This may lead to serious consequences, including: 1. Paying back the unemployment benefits you collected, plus penalties and fines, and losing eligibility for unemployment benefits in the future. a. First violation - We deny 26 weeks (six months) of future benefits and require you to pay back any benefits you should not have received, plus a penalty of 15 percent of that amount. b. Second violation - We deny 52 weeks (a full year) of future benefits and require you to pay back any benefits you should not have received, plus a penalty of 25 percent of that amount. c. Third and additional violations - We deny 104 weeks (two years) of future benefits and require you to pay back any benefits you should not have received, plus a penalty of 50 percent of that amount. 2. Prosecution. 3. Jail or prison. If you make a mistake, send us a message through your eServices account or call the Claims Center at 800-318-6022. How we identify fraud Here are some ways we identify people who are committing fraud: 1. Comparing the earnings reported by workers and their employers. 2. Auditing claims. 3. Checking earnings reported in Washington and other states. 4. Checking records in the National Directory of New Hires to make sure people aren’t collecting unemployment benefits when they start working again. 5. Checking job search contacts. 6. Investigating tips about possible fraud. 7. Verifying information with data in state and federal databases (cross matching). 8. Verifying the reason claimants are unemployed. WE TAKE fRAUD SERIOUSLY | PAGE 19 Report fraud ESD’s Office of Special Investigations oversees fraud prevention and detection activities: • The Fraud Prevention Unit investigates workers compensation, incarceration, and stranger wages issues.

You must use a laptop or desktop computer for this initial step—not a mobile device. If you don’t have a computer, stop by your local library or WorkSource center to use a computer. A confirmation page appears when you successfully submit a new application. You will also receive verification by email, if you gave us your email address as a way to communicate with you. How to apply by phone To speak to a claims agent, call the Claims Center at 800-318-6022 between Monday – Friday from 8 a.m. – 4 p.m. (except holidays) as follows: Monday: New applications for those with Social Security numbers ending in 0-3.

Review your wages and hours reported in the Unemployment Claim Determination letter. If you think wages are missing or incorrect, please call the Claims Center at 800-318-6022 to request a correction. The following wages do not automatically show up in your Unemployment Claim Determination letter. We must request them from the other state or employer so they can be added to your claim: 1. Work in other states. 2. Work for the federal government. 3. Active duty military service. BENEfIT PAYMENTS | PAGE 24 BENEfIT PAYMENTS How much will you receive? The amount of benefits you receive depends on your earnings (the money you made) in your base year. The maximum amount you can get per week is your Weekly Benefit Amount (WBA). Washington state’s unemployment minimum and maximum weekly benefit amount (WBA) may change from year to year. We do not pay less than the minimum or more than the maximum WBA. Please see our “Estimate your benefit” webpage at https://esd.wa.gov/ unemployment/calculate-your-benefit for this information. The total amount of benefits you can receive during an unemployment claim year is called your Maximum Benefit Amount (MBA). You get whichever amount is less. The WBA you receive may change depending on a number of situations that could deduct money from your weekly benefit amount. Your unemployment claim lasts for one year. Your benefits will not last that long, generally six months (26 weeks). It may last longer than six months if you have deductible earnings from working or collecting retirement pay. When will you know how much you will receive? If you apply for unemployment benefits online through your eServices account, you receive an immediate message entitled, Your Benefit Rights and Responsibilities. This information provides an estimate of your weekly benefit amount (WBA), the number of weeks these benefits will last and your maximum benefit amount (MBA). If you apply for unemployment benefits by phone, the claims agent will give you an estimate. Your Benefit Rights and Responsibilities are presented to you verbally. Once your application is submitted, we will send you an Unemployment Claim Determination letter by eServices or U.S. mail. Let us know if you don’t receive this letter within two weeks after you apply. BENEfIT PAYMENTS | PAGE 25 If your application includes prior employment (for the last 18 months) in the military, with a federal government agency or in other states, your letter may initially show you are not eligible for unemployment benefits. We must wait for wage information from those organizations or states to be reported to us, so you may receive multiple letters. The final letter shows your eligibility with all wages or earnings from all of your most recent employers. Your Unemployment Claim Determination letter After you apply for your unemployment claim, you will receive an Unemployment Claim Determination letter through the U.S. mail. This letter includes the wages reported by your base year employer(s) and, if you qualify for benefits, the weekly benefit amount you will receive. Your Unemployment Claim Determination letter includes the following information: 1. Your weekly benefit amount (WBA). 2. Your maximum benefits or maximum benefit amount (MBA). 3. How many hours you worked and how much you earned in your base year, as reported by your former employer(s). 4. Whether you worked enough hours to qualify for unemployment benefits (680 hours). 5. Any information about your claim. Review your Determination letter carefully Your Unemployment Claim Determination letter may be wrong or look wrong if: 1. You worked in one quarter and were paid in the next quarter. Employers report wages in the same quarter you are paid. If you believe moving these wages to the quarter you earned them might give you a better claim or help you to qualify for benefits, call the Claims Center at 1-800-318-6022. 2. Your employer(s) incorrectly reported your Social Security number, wages or hours, or didn’t send us a report. 3. There are wages reported for someone else, known as stranger wages. BENEfIT PAYMENTS | PAGE 26 4. You were in the military, worked for the federal government or worked in other states. These wages do not appear on your Unemployment Claim Determination letter. We send you a Redetermination of Benefits, Wages and Hours with corrected information once we receive the information from your employer or other states. 5. We did not correctly record your wages and hours in our computer system. We will send you an updated letter or redetermination letter each time wages or hours are added or corrected. If you think any information is wrong or missing, send us a message through your eServices account or call the Claims Center at 800-318-6022. Please have paystubs available before you call, if you feel you have underreported wages or unreported wages. What if you didn’t work enough hours in your base year to qualify? You may be eligible for an Alternate Base Year (ABY) claim if you did not work the required 680 hours in your regular base year. If you meet the conditions above related to federal, military or out-of-state employment, we wait for those wages to be reviewed first before changing your base year. The Unemployment Claim Determination letter will give you an option to request an ABY if you don’t qualify for a regular claim. You can BENEfIT PAYMENTS | PAGE 27 send us a message through your eServices account or call 800-318-6022 to find out if you qualify for benefits with an ABY. An ABY uses the most recent completed calendar quarters as your base year. The quarters used depends on when you applied for benefits. You must have 680 hours of work in your ABY and still meet all other eligibility requirements to qualify for unemployment benefits. What is deducted from your benefits? Earnings When you file a new claim or submit your weekly claim, you must report any work you did and earnings you received or will receive for that week. You must report your earnings in the week you performed the work, not when you got paid for the work. Report your gross pay before any deductions are taken out. Please ensure that you report the earnings using the employer that matches the employer name on your pay stub, check or pay statement. We adjust your weekly benefit amount by deducting part of your earnings. By reporting all your earnings, you will avoid having to pay back benefits later. Examples of deductible earnings and other payments you must report: 1. Net income from your own business. 2. In-kind payments that substitute for money, such as rent or room and board. 3. Bonuses attributed to work performed in that week. 4. Tips in any form. 5. Paid vacation, holidays and sick leave. 6. Military Reserve and National Guard pay if you worked more than three days in a row. 7. Pay for jury duty service. 8. Earnings from state work study (does not include Title IV funds). 9. Pay from an employer, such as back pay (including back pay from a time-loss or workers’ compensation claim) for weeks you claimed. Workers’ compensation Workers’ compensation paid by L&I or a private insurer due to an on-the- job injury, including back pay of wage replacement such as: time-loss, loss of earning power payments and adjustments. Let us know if you are BENEfIT PAYMENTS | PAGE 28 appealing a decision to deny your workers’ compensation benefits. If time-loss and loss of earning power benefits are paid for any week(s) you have already received unemployment insurance benefits, you may have an overpayment. Separation pay 1. Severance packages (WAC 192-190-045) from an employer usually do not affect your unemployment benefits. 2. Pay in lieu of notice (WAC 192-190-055 and 192-190-050), or continuation pay with full benefits that are guaranteed, can affect your benefits. Report any separation related payments you receive or are entitled to receive when you file your weekly claim(s). We may ask additional questions to determine if your separation pay is deductible. Retirement plans You must tell us if you receive or apply to receive payment from your retirement plan. We may deduct the employer-paid portion of your retirement from your unemployment benefits. If you receive a lump sum retirement payment, the amount we must deduct each week is based on your life expectancy. However, if you withdraw any money from your retirement plan prior to or after the roll over while you are claiming, you must report it. These payment types are not deductible: 1. Social Security. 2. Disability payments based on an injury (includes VA disability). 3. Payments based on someone else’s work (survivor, widow, or divorce decree settlement pensions). 4. Retirement plans that were transferred within 60 days to a long- term retirement account, such as an IRA. BENEfIT PAYMENTS | PAGE 29 What may be withheld from your benefits? Unemployment benefits overpayment Sometimes we deduct some or all of your unemployment benefits payment to pay back an overpayment. If we require you to pay back benefits due to an overpayment, you must pay us: 1. The benefits received. 2. Any child support withheld from those benefits and sent to the Department of Social and Health Services on your behalf. 3. Any money withheld from those benefits for income tax and sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on your behalf. Child support If you owe child support, we may be required to withhold a portion of your weekly unemployment benefit payments. If you have questions about the amount of your withholding, contact your local Department of Social and Health Services Division of Child Support. We can’t refund money that we withheld for child support. Income tax You have two options for paying federal income tax on your unemployment benefits: 1. You can pay all taxes owed at tax time; or 2. We can withhold 10 percent of your payment each week. (This option may help you avoid a large tax bill) You can change your option using your eServices account or call the Claims Center at 800-318-6022. We can’t refund money that we already withheld for income tax. By the end of January each year, we send you an IRS form 1099-G showing the total benefits we paid and the amount of income tax withheld in the prior calendar year. You receive this through your eServices account or by U.S. mail. Please make sure your mailing and email addresses are current even after you stop claiming. We send this form to the address on your claim as of December 31 of the prior calendar year. Additionally, we provide this information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). BENEfIT PAYMENTS | PAGE 30 The amount on the 1099-G does not include any adjustments, such as money you paid back because of an overpayment in that year. If you repaid any of your benefits, you may need to resolve the issue with the IRS by subtracting the amount you repaid from the amount we paid you and reporting the difference. You can use receipts or other records to adjust the amount to enter on your tax return. If you have questions about how to report adjustments to the IRS, contact your tax preparer, your local IRS office or refer to IRS Publication 525 for more information. In eServices, you can see previous years’ tax information for your unemployment benefits. If you call the Claims Center’s automated claims line, you can receive last year’s tax information between January 30 and April 30. If we sent you more than one 1099-G, you may have received training benefits in addition to your unemployment insurance benefits. You may need to add up all 1099-Gs when calculating the amount of benefits you received as well as the income tax withheld. If you file your tax return electronically, you must tell the IRS which agency paid you the benefits. Include our federal Employer Identification Number, which is 91-6001099. If you did not receive a 1099-G from us or misplaced it, you can access it in eServices, or you may request a copy as follows: Sign in to eServices and choose the “1099 forms” tab. Email: UI1099@esd.wa.gov Phone: call the Claims Center Fax: 800-301-1796 U.S. mail: Employment Security Department Attn: UI Imaging/1099 PO Box 19019 Olympia, WA 98507-0019 BENEfIT PAYMENTS | PAGE 31 Please provide the following in your 1099-G request: 1. Name 2. Date of birth 3. Your Claim ID number or last four digits of your Social Security number 4. Current and previous mailing address 5. Phone number When will you be paid? The first week you claim is your waiting week. You must meet the eligibility requirements to get credit for your waiting week. You are not paid benefits for your waiting week. If you are otherwise eligible when you file for your second week, you will receive your first benefit payment. There are situations that may prevent or delay your waiting week, or any subsequent week, from being considered a qualified week. These situations may include but are not limited to: 1. Your reason for separation 2. Availability issues like: a. Vacationing b. Illness or hospitalization c. Lack of child care d. School attendance 3. Not seeking work 4. Excess income like: a. Earning more than the earnings deduction from your WBA b. Other income such as vacation or holiday pay, or termination pay c. Retirement pay If you are waiting for a decision due to any situation mentioned above, we advise you to continue filing your weekly claims. If the decision is in your favor, you receive benefits for all qualifying weeks that you claimed. If there are no delays or issues on your claim, you meet eligibility requirements and you file your weekly claim, payment will be issued, but may not arrive the same day each week. If we issue your payment and you don’t receive it within seven business days, send us a message through your eServices account or call the Claims Center at 800-318-6022. Note: Current 2018 Earnings Deduction Chart can be found at the back of this handbook. BENEfIT PAYMENTS | PAGE 32 How will you get your payment? There are two options for receiving your benefit payments: • prepaid debit card or • direct deposit If you are applying online through your eServices account, you can select direct deposit or the debit card method. If you are applying by phone you will receive a debit card. If you prefer direct deposit, our claims agents can give you directions on how to enter your direct deposit information in your eServices account. For your security, claims agents can’t take your banking information over the phone. In both cases, we deposit your benefit funds electronically – either onto the debit card or into your designated bank account. To learn more about the debit card option, go to https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/debit-card To learn more about the direct deposit option, go to https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/direct-deposit What if you are overpaid? We continue to review your eligibility while you are claiming benefits. At any time, we may question your eligibility for some or all of the weeks you were paid benefits. We will ask you for more information to decide if we paid you more than you should have received. We will send you a decision and notify you of any overpayment. The written decision explains the facts, the law, the reason you were overpaid and the weeks for which we reduced or denied benefits. If you have any questions about our decision, send us a message through your eServices account or call the Claims Center at 800-318-6022. If you did not cause the overpayment, we send you a form to request a waiver. A waiver means you may not be required to pay back some or all of the overpayment. Under limited circumstances, we may waive an overpayment. BENEfIT PAYMENTS | PAGE 33 We cannot waive an overpayment if you: 1. Caused it. 2. Received conditional payments. 3. Were fired for misconduct connected with your work. 4. Committed fraud. If you disagree with any decision, you can file an appeal. We postpone collecting an overpayment while an appeal that was filed 30 days from the time when the decision was mailed. The date by which you need to appeal is in the decision letter. Once the decision is final, we begin the process of collecting the overpaid benefits. A decision is final when: 1. You do not appeal our decision by the deadline in the letter. If you miss the deadline, we begin collection action, even if you file a late appeal. If you win your late appeal, we refund any money we’ve collected. 2. You do not appeal a decision made by the Office of Administrative Hearings by the deadline in that decision. 3. You do not appeal a decision made by the Commissioner’s Review Office by the deadline in that decision. How do you repay an overpayment? An overpayment is a legal debt you must repay. You have four ways to pay back an overpayment: 1. Sign in and pay using eServices. 2. Pay electronically at esd.wa.gov. 3. Make a payment by calling the number below. 4. Mail a check or money order payable to Employment Security Department to the address below. Include your name and Social Security number (or customer identification number) on your payment. BENEfIT PAYMENTS | PAGE 34 If you don’t repay the overpayment, we may take action, such as putting a lien on your property or garnishing your wages, bank accounts or federal income tax refund.

If you are still unemployed, keep submitting your weekly claims and looking for suitable work while you are waiting for your hearing. You can only be paid for weeks you actually claimed. An administrative law judge will hear your case. The judge who hears your case is neutral and is not employed by the Employment Security Department. At the hearing, all testimony is given under oath. You will have the right to question anyone present at the hearing and offer evidence or testimony. Your availability for work and work-search history will be examined during the hearing, so have your job search log available. Within two to three weeks after the hearing, the Office of Administrative Hearings will reach a decision based on the facts gathered during the hearing and send you a written decision called an Initial Order explaining the result.

LOOKING fOR WORK | PAGE 42 LOOKING fOR WORK While collecting unemployment benefits, you must look for suitable work and keep a job search log. You must also be registered at a Washington state WorkSource office or American Job Center in the state where you live (unless we inform you otherwise). WorkSource offices offer classes and other programs and services that are designed to help you return to work faster. Work registration Once you file a claim for unemployment benefits, you’re automatically registered with your local American Job Center called a WorkSource office in Washington state. The WorkSource office is assigned based on your zip code. If you live outside of Washington, you must register for work within one week from the date you receive your first unemployment benefit payment with your local American Job Center. If you originally filed from Washington then move within the United States or to Canada and continue to meet all eligibility requirements, you will remain eligible for benefits. You must look for work and register for work where you live. Locate your local WorkSource office or American Job Center: Washington Outside Washington WorkSourceWA.com careeronestop.org or 877-872-5627 Are you required to register for work? You are automatically registered for work through a Washington state WorkSource office or American Job Center in another state unless you are: 1. Attached to an employer, meaning you are: a. Considered partially unemployed. b. On department approved standby. c. Unemployed because you are on strike or locked out due to a labor dispute. d. Participating in the SharedWork program. 2. A member of a union that participates in the full-referral union program. LOOKING fOR WORK | PAGE 43 3. Participating in a training program approved by the department. 4. The subject of an anti-harassment order. This includes any court- issued order providing for your protection, such as restraining orders, no contact orders, domestic violence protective orders, and similar documents. Go to https://www.worksourcewa.com/ to locate the WorkSource office closest to you. How do you register for work if you are out of state? If you live in another state or relocate to a new area, you must register for work within one week of the date your first payment is issued on your new or reopened claim. You can locate an American Job Center using the website at servicelocator.org. In many cases you may be able to register online. Contact your local office to find out how to complete the registration process. If you do not register for work, you will be denied benefits for each week you are not registered. Job search requirements Do you have to look for suitable work? Yes, everyone has to look for suitable work unless one of the following is true: 1. We approve you for a training program, such as Commissioner Approved Training or Training Benefits. 2. We approve you for SharedWork. 3. We approve you for standby. 4. You are dispatched through a full-referral union. 5. You are partially unemployed (and approved by the department). Note: If you are a full-referral union member, you must look for work by meeting your union’s dispatch requirements. A full-referral union means a union that refers its members to jobs by referral or dispatch. LOOKING fOR WORK | PAGE 44 How will you know if your job search activities have been waived We will notify you in writing based on the correspondence preference you selected. You must look for work unless you have been notified by the department that you don’t have to. If you are required to look for work, you must meet Washington state’s job search requirements each week you claim benefits (unless we inform you otherwise) by: 1. Making employer contacts; or 2. Participating in approved job search activities in person at a WorkSource office or American Job Center. You are required to make a minimum of three employer contacts, or three qualified in-person job search activities at the local WorkSource office or employment center, or a combination of both, totaling three. For example, make one employer contact and two approved in-person job search activities. If your job search requirements change, we will notify you. What is an employer contact? When inquiring about a position, you must take all steps necessary to apply for the position for the contact to count as a job search activity. If you have applied or inquired about the job and discovered that the employer is not hiring or accepting applications, you may still count your inquiry as an employer contact if you were unaware the employer was not hiring or accepting applications when making the contact and should note that fact in your job search log. Be sure to record all details required for the type of contact you make, as shown in the tables later in this section. Examples of contacts that do not count as employer contacts: 1. Contacting employers you already know are not hiring. 2. Browsing the Internet or a newspaper. 3. Posting your resume online without submitting an application for employment. 4. Having others look for work for you (such as “head-hunters”). 5. Working to set up your own business. 6. Calling job lines to hear lists of job openings. 7. Checking in with current employers or calling recruiting services with which you are already registered. LOOKING fOR WORK | PAGE 45 You make an employer contact when you ask about or apply for a job. You can contact an employer by: 1. Email 2. Fax 3. Internet 4. Mail 5. Phone 6. Meeting in-person 7. Virtual meeting using video conferencing services like Skype, GoToMeeting, etc. 8. An employer’s self-service kiosk. What is an approved in-person job search activity at a WorkSource office or American Job Center?

You must keep it at least 30 days after the end of your benefit year or 30 days after you stop receiving benefits, whichever is later. You don’t need to send it to us unless we request it. We may request to see your job search log We conduct random reviews of job search activities to make sure you are looking for suitable work. If you are selected for a review or we have a question about your job search, we will request a copy of your job search log(s) and you must provide them as instructed. We may send you a letter to schedule a review of your job search activities to make sure you are looking for suitable work, review your eligibility for benefits and, when appropriate, provide feedback on how to improve your job search. Read the letter carefully to see if your interview is by phone or in-person. Have your job search log(s) ready. If your log is missing or incomplete, or you are not making a genuine attempt to find suitable work, we may deny benefits. You then have to pay back benefits for all the weeks you didn’t meet the job search requirements. LOOKING fOR WORK | PAGE 50 If you didn’t complete your job search log correctly Even if you can show you have substantially complied with the job search requirements, we may suggest how you should modify your job search efforts or improve your documentation to complete your job search log. We may also schedule you for an additional appointment to confirm you are meeting the requirements. If you cannot show you are making a genuine attempt to find suitable work, we may deny your benefits. If we deny your benefits, you must pay back benefits you received for weeks you did not meet the job search requirements. In addition, we will schedule a review of your job search activities for all weeks you claimed. When you need to accept a job offer You must accept an offer of suitable work based on your skills, abilities and other factors for your occupation in your labor market. If there are limited jobs in your occupation or geographical area, you may have to expand your job search. For example, you may have to consider looking for a job in a different field or location. You can’t limit your search to jobs that start in the future. For example, if you’re a school bus driver on summer break, you can’t limit your search to jobs that start in the fall or work that will end when school begins.

You must have 680 hours of work in covered employment during the regular base year to qualify for unemployment benefits. If you do not have 680 hours in the regular base year, you can choose to file a claim using the last four completed calendar quarters. This is called an Alternate Base Year (ABY) claim. For an ABY claim to be valid, you must have at least 680 hours reported during the last four completed calendar quarters. Wages from any other quarters cannot be used to establish the ABY claim. Base year - in Washington state it is the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters, before the week in which a claimant files an application for initial determination. Benefit year - the 52-week period during which you can receive benefits on your claim. It begins the Sunday of the week you apply for unemployment benefits.
