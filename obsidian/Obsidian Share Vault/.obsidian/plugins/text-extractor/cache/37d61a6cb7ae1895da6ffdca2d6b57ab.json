This Institute pursues this objective by integrat- ing the model-driven paradigm typically followed in Operations Research with data-driven methodologies coming from AI. The research in AI4OPT is use- inspired, addressing fundamental societal and tech- nological challenges of our times. They include • How to design agile, sustainable, resilient, and eq- uitable supply chains? • How to operate energy systems powered by dis- tributed renewable energy resources? • How to deliver a step change in chip design and manufacturing, and manufacturing as a whole? • How to create sustainable eco-systems within the food-water-energy nexus? AI4OPT focuses on AI for Engineering, which raises deep scientific challenges in terms of reliability, ro- bustness, and scalability. Indeed, AI4OPT is driven by high-stake applications that feature physical, engi- neering, and business constraints, and complex objec- tives that must balance efficiency, resilience, sustain- ability, and equity. Moreover, the underlying opti- mization problems at the core of the grand challenges are of very large scale, many of which are beyond the scope of existing technologies. To address these, AI4OPT is organized around methodology thrusts that focus on specific challenges: they include a new gen- eration of data-driven optimization solvers, decision making under uncertainty, combinatorial and rein- forcement learning, end-to-end optimization, and de- centralized learning and optimization. In addition, a transversal thrust on Ethical AI ensures that ethics is included in the design of every fundamental and use- inspired project, not as an afterthought. The comple- mentarity of the end-use cases and the methodology thrusts creates a virtuous cycle of innovation, both in foundational research and industrial impact. The research mission of AI4OPT is complemented by its educational vision which is to create longitudinal pathways for AI in en- gineering, from high-school to graduate edu- cation, using a “teach the teachers” philos- ophy to maximize impact. The pathways start in middle and high-schools (through summer camps and engineering practices), move to undergraduate education through the Fac- ulty Training Program, and the creation of graduate programs. The “teaching the teachers” philosophy is pervasive across the Institute: its goal is to empower teachers at every education level to create programs in their own institutions, e.g., minors and majors in artificial intelligence. AI4OPT also includes mentor- ship programs to help students take leadership roles and reinforce their understanding of the material over time. The Institute has a strong focus on histori- cally black high schools, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Minority Serving In- 1arXiv:2307.02671v1 [math.OC] 5 Jul 2023 stitutions (MSI), to develop talent and increase the diversity of the AI workforce. AI4OPT is led by the Georgia Insitute of Technology in collaboration with universities in California (UC Berkeley, USC, UC San Diego), Texas (UT Arling- ton), and Georgia (Clark Atlanta University). The Institute is creating a vibrant nexus in AI and op- timization, bringing together academic institutions, industrial partners, international collaborators, and educators. In Atlanta, AI4OPT is located on the 12th floor of CODA building in Midtown, providing a prime space for faculty, research scientists, and stu- dents that encourages knowledge cross-fertilization. The Industrial Partner Program (IPP) of AI4OPT features novel internship programs to facilitate re- search collaborations between academia and indus- try. It assembles some of the most innovative compa- nies in supply chains, manufacturing, and energy sys- tems, with the goal of maximizing the impact emerg- ing from the fusion of AI and optimization. The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates how the Institute contributes scientific breakthroughs that the two fields cannot achieve independently. Section 3 describes some of the societal and technological challenges that are driving AI4OPT research. Section 4 briefly reviews the methodology thrusts driven by the end-use cases. Sections 5 and 6 outline some workforce development activities and how AI4OPT acts as a nexus at the in- tersection of AI and optimization. It is impossible to do justice to all the activities of the Institute in a short article, but the hope is that this presentation will encourage readers to learn more about AI4OPT. 2 Optimization Proxies At its core, optimization models are used in decision- making applications to map problem inputs into op- timal solutions. Optimization solvers have seen dra- matic progress over the last decades, producing op- timal solutions to many industrial problems. For in- stance, optimization models quite literally keep the lights on by committing generators and dispatching electricity in real time every five minutes. Optimiza- tion models run end-to-end supply chains, which in- volve aspects such as the scheduling of manufacturing plants, load consolidation for middle-mile logistics, and the design of e-commerce networks, to name a few. Yet recent developments are challenging even the best solvers: optimization models have grown even larger, are expected to capture the realities of an increasingly uncertain and volatile world, and are blurring the distinction between planning and opera- tions. As a result, optimization solvers have become Figure 1: The Architecture of Optimization Proxies. Figure 2: Real-Time Risk Assessment. too slow in many contexts: they include real-time ap- plications, large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations that are based on optimization, and environments where humans interact with optimization technology. In those circumstances, it is natural to explore whether machine learning can replace optimization, moving most of the computational burden offline. A machine-learning model can then learn the input- output mapping of the optimization model, produc- ing a first approximation to the concept of an opti- mization proxy. The challenge, however, comes from applying this idea to AI for Engineering. Indeed, many of the end-use cases of the Institute feature optimization problems with hard physical, engineer- ing, and business constraints. For instance, in an electrical grid, the load (demand) and the generation (supply) must be equal at all times. In supply chains, shipments must fit within the vehicle capacity. In ad- dition, optimization proxies will be deployed in high- stake applications, which means that they must cater to a wide variety of instances, deliver high-quality solutions with performance guarantees, and learn in- stances with millions of input parameters and make hundreds of thousands of predictions. To address these considerations, the End-to-End Optimization thrust explores the science and engi- neering of optimization proxies. Its research led to novel architectures including the one depicted in Fig- ure 1. This architecture postulates an optimization proxy as the composition of a machine-learning layer that produces a high-quality approximation of the optimization model, followed by a feasibility layer that repairs the prediction to deliver a feasible so- 2 lution. This Learning and Repair architecture can be trained end-to-end, backpropagating the loss function through the feasibility layers. This fusion of AI and optimization can deliver breakthroughs that cannot be achieved by the two fields independently. One such application is real- time risk assessment, which is becoming increasingly pervasive in energy systems and supply chains, in- cluding for some of the key partners of AI4OPT. As mentioned earlier, transmission system operators typ- ically solve a market-clearing optimization every five minutes to balance load and generation. Given the increased volatility in net load due to intermittent renewable resources, grid operators are interested in real-time risk assessment tools, like the one described in Figure 2. Such tools run a large number of Monte- Carlo simulations, using scenarios from probabilistic forecasts, to quantify the system-wide risk. A single simulation may take up to 45 minutes, given the com- putational complexity and the sheer number of opti- mization problems, making it impractical to assess risk in real time. Work by the Institute has shown that optimization proxies are a transformative tech- nology for this application: they make it possible to run these simulations in a few milliseconds with rel- ative errors below 1%, giving rise to potential new tools to manage risk in real time (Chen et al., 2022). 3 End-Use Cases As mentioned, already, at AI4OPT, challenges from end-use cases inspire foundational research, which then delivers innovations to address them. Here is a brief description of these end-use cases. Supply Chains Supply-chain management used to be an arcane topic, discussed by a few and invisible to the general public. This has changed after the pandemic: the public is now aware of a topic that has become top-of-mind in many corporate boards. Supply chains have become larger, and e-commerce has proliferated, imposing significant environmental costs to meet new customer expectations. At the same time, many customers and suppliers, especially in rural regions, face increasing difficulties in procur- ing or delivering specific products. What is needed is a paradigm change, a new vision for supply chains that complements efficiency with resilience, sustain- ability, and equity goals. Research in supply chains at AI4OPT is centered around end-to-end supply chains, with scalability, resilience, sustainability, and equity as core challenges. AI4OPT has assembled a consor- tium of partners that cover (almost) all aspects of supply chains. It leverages novel forecasting meth- ods, optimization proxies, decision making under un- certainty, and automation to meet these challenges. Energy Systems The challenge for energy systems is clear: how to reinvent the planning and operations of a grid powered by renewable energy sources and storage. Energy systems are transitioning from the century-old “generation follows the load” organiza- tion of the grid to a paradigm centered on risk assess- ment and risk management. This end-use case helps reinvent energy systems by pursuing four overarching themes: (1) probabilistic forecasting to quantify un- certainty; (2) stochastic and risk-aware optimization to capture this uncertainty in decision processes; (3) optimization proxies to perform real-time risk assess- ment and risk-aware optimization; and (4) decentral- ized optimization to address the massive proliferation of distributed energy resources. Chip Design and Manufacturing Each genera- tion of chips is becoming more expensive to design, requiring numerous cycles between expert designers and simulators. It is no longer possible or desirable to separate the various phases of the design, e.g., circuit synthesis, placement, and routing. What is needed is a new generation of tools that help engineers design circuits more holistically. Machine learning (includ- ing RL and inverse learning) has been shown to have significant potential in this area; it is the goal of this end-use case to explore its role in circuit optimiza- tion. Chip manufacturing has also becoming increas- ingly complex and subject to uncertainty in supply, demand, and the complexity of the bill of materials. In conjunction with supply chains, this end-use case also aims at transforming the optimization of the chip manufacturing process. Sustainable Systems The food-energy-water nexus is identified as one of the key grand challenges of the 21st century and AI has demonstrated early potential to address complex problems in this space. This end-use case conducts three interconnected projects on biogas, water, and food to reduce greenhouse emissions and boost food production. 4 Methodology Thrusts The methodology thrusts carry out foundational AI research inspired by the end-use cases. Here is a brief description of the methodology thrusts of AI4OPT. End-to-End Optimization The End-to-End Op- timization thrust primarily focuses on the science 3 and engineering of optimization proxies that were de- scribed in Section 2. Recent contributions include the concepts of self-supervised primal-dual learning (Park and Van Hentenryck, 2023), compact learning (Park et al., 2023), and End-To-End Learning and Repair (Chen et al., 2023). The thrust draws inspi- ration from the end-use cases in energy systems and supply chains, and also explores topics in decision- focused learning, learning to optimize, verification, explanation, and formal guarantees. New Generation Solvers The Solvers thrust works on a new generation of highly tunable opti- mization solvers that use machine learning and his- torical data to dramatically improve performance in settings where an optimization model is used repeatedly. Recent results apply the Learning to Optimize paradigm to mixed-integer programming (Huang et al., 2023a), mixed-integer nonlinear pro- gramming (Ferber et al., 2023), and AI planners (Huang et al., 2023b). The end-use cases contribute problem instances to benchmark solver performance. Decision Making Under Uncertainty The en- ergy and supply-chain end-use cases clearly indicate the need for advances in decision making under un- certainty. This includes probabilistic forecasting, un- certainty quantification, scenario generation, and de- tection of rare events in presence of spatial-temporal correlations (Xu and Xie, 2022). Of particular inter- est is the fundamental and applied research on con- formal predictions. The thrust also explores solution techniques for specific classes of multi-stage stochas- tic optimization problems (Lan and Shapiro, 2023) and new Bayesian risk-sensitive and distributionally- robust optimization models (Ju and Lan, 2023). Reinforcement Learning The RL thrust focuses on the end-use cases of the Institute, which are much larger and more complex than environments in which RL has been successful so far. It contributes foun- dational advances to deep RL to handle such com- plex environments (Laskin et al., 2022), and expands RL research to include societal and ethical consid- erations. The thrust will be increasingly focused on offline RL (Chen and Maguluri, 2022) to make the technology safer and more amenable to industrial use. Combinatorial Learning This thrust studies ma- chine learning in the context of combinatorial and highly constrained applications with the goal to im- prove generalization and interpretability and reduce errors. Recent results include highly-specific strong convex models with structured sparsity (Atamt¨urk Figure 3: Faculty Training Program Cohort 1. and G´omez, 2022), pairwise-based optimization al- gorithms for counteracting learning bias (Hochbaum et al., 2023), and meta-algorithms to automatically select the best solver (As´ın-Ach´a et al., 2022). Distributed and Multi-Agent Learning and Optimization This thrust explores decentralized solutions to manage a large number of agents, mo- tivated by applications in energy systems and au- tomated warehouses. Recent results focus on AI- based decentralized path planning and execution (Xu et al., 2022), on how agents can help each other learn through communication (Zhang et al., 2022), and dis- tributed learning algorithms that are robust against communication imperfections (Zeng et al., 2023). Ethical AI The Ethical AI thrust is transversal: it draws from, and informs, every thrust and end-use case in the Institute. It leverages the fusion of opti- mization and machine learning to ensure ethical and socially conscious design of large scale deployments. Projects include creating new theoretical foundations for ethics in practice (Gupta et al., 2023), includ- ing fairness into supply chains and energy networks (Hettle et al., 2021), technological progress for high- impact policy changes (Gillani et al., 2023), and the incorporation of IEEE Well-being Metrics into the de- sign and deployment of AI and optimization research. 5 Workforce Development The education and workforce development initiatives of AI4OPT are presented in detail by Pierre et al. (2022) and are only briefly mentioned here. Per- haps the most distinctive feature of these programs is the “teaching the teachers” philosophy that perme- ates the initiatives. AI4OPT is reaching middle and 4 high-school students through the Seth Bonder sum- mer camps that are delivered, not only to students, but also to high-school teachers. The camps are or- ganized at Georgia Tech, at UC Berkeley, and online (in collaboration with Kids Teach Tech), and attract a diverse range of participants, with a large propor- tion of minority students and young women. Stu- dents who succesfully complete the camp are invited to become mentors in the following year. The AI4OPT Faculty Training Program (FTP) pro- vides faculty members from HBCUs and MSIs with courses in AI, data science, and course design to cre- ate minors and majors in AI at their own institutions. This three-year program includes a yearly 3-4 week visit to Georgia Tech and online courses throughout the year. The program started in June 2022, and multiple FTP participants are already creating mi- nors and majors, and are working with AI4OPT to expand their AI offerings. 6 AI4OPT as a Nexus AI4OPT acts as a nexus for AI and optimization with applications in supply chains, energy systems, man- ufacturing, and sustainability. The Institute nexus is organized around its research and educational pro- grams, its Industrial Partner Program (IPP), its na- tional and international collaborations, and its out- reach activities. In outreach, AI4OPT is pursuing ad- ditional partnerships, e.g., with Jackson State Uni- versity in Mississipi and Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. The IPP continues to grow and covers the entire spectrum of activities in end-to- end supply chains and the planning and operations of electrical power systems. AI4OPT features novel longitudinal internships that are piloted by the Insti- tute at Georgia Tech, and strong collaborations with DOE national laboratories, Independent Systems Op- erators (ISO), and peer international institutions. A particularly exciting development is the collaboration with the AI Institute ICICLE around decentralized collaborative multimodal food supply chains with a focus on tribal communities.
