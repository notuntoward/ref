Battery, lead impedance, sensing amplitude and pacing threshold data was reviewed and tested. PROGRAMMING EVALUATION PERFORMED IMPRESSIONS Normal In-Oﬃce: No Events Normal Device Function Alerts or events: None Battery: OK, 11.5 years Sensing, impedance and thresholds reviewed and tested Presenting Rhythm: was AP VS 60s Underlying Rhythm: historically no P waves at 40 ppm, intact AV conduction Heart Rate Histograms reviewed Pacing and Detection Parameters were evaluated Additional Notes: BSX rep present to oﬀer programming options from tech support engineers Created By: Lynn Settergren 07/30/2024 03:24 PM Edited By: Lynn Settergren 07/30/2024 03:40 PM Rate Response Suboptimal Rate histograms consistent with or suggestive of suboptimal rate response programming Patient Symptomatic? reports inadequate HR response for cycling with accelerometer only. Accelerometer only provided adequate HR for walking. Device Reprogrammed? Y 24 hr sensor trend playback with MV ON would increase sensor rates approximately 20ppm with VT threshold ON and response factor of 8 Created By: Lynn Settergren 07/30/2024 03:31 PM Device Reprogrammed Device reprogrammed, changes are listed below: MV ON without Ventilatory Threshold response factor. MV response factor of 7 by pt's preference instead of proposed response factor of 5, so not to accelerate rate too quickly min paced AV delay shortened from 200-140ms min sensed AV delay shortened from 190-130ms Created By: Lynn Settergren 07/30/2024 03:36 PM Edited By: Lynn Settergren 07/30/2024 03:38 PM PLAN Routine remote and in-oﬃce follow up as needed Additional Notes: quarterly transmissions, annual oﬃce visit LEAD MFR MODEL IMPLANT DATE Right Atrium Boston Scientiﬁc 7841 2021-11-15 Right Ventricle Boston Scientiﬁc 7842 2021-11-15 BATTERY: Battery has 11.5 years left.
