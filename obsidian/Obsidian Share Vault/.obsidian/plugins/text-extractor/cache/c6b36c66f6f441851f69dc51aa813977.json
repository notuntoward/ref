It is perhaps reasonable to model S(t) is a random quantity that becomes known at time t, and that the probability distribution of S(t) is continuous (i.e. is given by a pdf). Many random quantities are normally distributed, but this is not so reasonable for S(t), for example because a normal random quantity X satisﬁes P [X < 0] > 0 but S(t) cannot be negative. A better model for stock prices is the log-normal distribution. A random quantity X is log-normal if X takes only positive values and log(X) is normally distributed. [Recall that in this course, log is to the base e, i.e. log is the same as ln]. We now give a rough theoretical justiﬁcation of how the log-normal distribution arises as a reasonable model. Suppose we let A(t, u) denote the (random) accumulation factor for an investment in stock from time t to time u > t, i.e. we set A(t, u) = S(u) S(t) For example A(t, u) > 2 means the stock price more than doubles between time t and time u, while A(t, u) < 1 means the stock price goes down between time t and time u. In general, A(t, u) − 1 = S(u) − S(t) S(t) is the proportionate change in the stock price from time t up to time u. We are interested in modelling the probability distribution of A(t, u), i.e. in the values of P [A(t, u) < x] for any given x, and any given t, u. It is perhaps reasonable to assume that the probability distribution of A(t, t + h) depends on h but not on t. We also assume that the probability distribution of A(t, t + h) is INDEPENDENT of the stock price S(t), and also of the earlier stock prices S(s), s ≤ t. What these assumptions say is that the probability distribution of the proportionate stock price change in the next h units of time does not depend on the current stock price or on the past history of the stock price. For example, we are assuming that P [A(t, t + 0.5) > 1.25] which is the probability the stock price goes up by more than 25% in the next six months after time t, does not depend on the value of t and also does not depend on the value of the stock price S(t) or the earlier history of stock prices up to time t. Making these assumptions, we can make progress. Fix t < u. Let n be a positive integer and for j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n set tj = t + (j/n)(u − t) (so t0 = t and tn = u). Then S(u) S(t) = S(tn) S(t0) = (S(t1) S(t0))(S(t2) S(t1))(S(t3) S(t2)) · · · ( S(tn) S(tn−1)) so that A(t, u) = A(t0, t1)A(t1, t2) · · · A(tn−1, tn) 1 and if we set L(t, u) = log A(t, u), we have L(t, u) = L(t0, t1) + L(t1, t2) + · · · + L(tn−1, tn) By our assumptions, the random quantities L(tj−1, tj) (1 ≤ j ≤ n) are independent and identically distributed. Taking n to be very large, we can use the central limit theorem to plausibly deduce that L(t, u) is normally distributed. By assumption, L(s, s + t) has a distribution which depends only on t. By the above we assume also that it is a normal distribution, with mean m(t) and variance v(t). Also, L(0, t + u) = L(0, t) + L(t, t + u) (1) is a sum of independent normals, so by taking means and variances in (1) we have m(t + u) = m(t) + m(u), v(t + u) = v(t) + v(u) and from this one can deduce that both m(t) and v(t) are proportional to t, i.e. there is a constant c and a nonnegative constant σ such that m(t) = ct, v(t) = σ2t so that for any t < u we have log S(u) S(t) = log A(t, u) = L(t, u) ∼ N (c(u − t), σ2(u − t)) For example, suppose we know S(0) = 1. What is the expected value E[S(t)]? We have S(t) = A(0, t) = exp L(0, t) and L(0, t) ∼ N (ct, σ2t) so that with Z denoting a standard normal we have L(0, t) = ct + σ√tZ and hence S(t) = A(0, t) = exp(ct + σ√ tZ) = e cteσ√tZ so that E[S(t)] = ectE[e σ√tZ] = e cteσ2t/2 = exp((c + (σ2/2))t) 2 Writing µ for c + σ2/2, we have E[S(t)] = eµt So µ denotes the growth rate for the expected stock price, in the same way as the risk-free interest rate r (compounded continuously) gives the growth rate for a risk-free investment, eg a unit investment risk-free at time 0 is worth e rt at time t. We say the stock price process is a geometric Brownian motion (or lognormal process) with expected rate of return (or inﬁnitesimal drift) µ and volatility σ. Note that µ is related to c by µ = c + σ2 2 so that c = µ − σ2 2 Deﬁnition. Let σ > 0 and let µ be a constant. A lognormal process (or geometric Brownian motion), with expected rate of return µ and volatility σ, is a family of random variables S(t), t ≥ 0 with the properties that: • For all t ≥ 0, u ≥ 0, log ( S(t + u) S(t) ) ∼ N ( (µ − σ2 2 )u, σ2u ) . • For any t ≥ 0, u ≥ 0 and any 0 ≤ s1 < s2 < · · · sn ≤ t we have S(t + u) S(t) is indep’t of (S(s1), S(s2), . . . , S(sn)) By a similar argument to the argument for E[S(t)] when S(0) = 1 given above, if S(t), t ≥ 0 follows a log-normal process with inﬁnitesimal drift µ and volatility σ, and for some particular t = T ≥ 0 the value of S(t) is known, then for u ≥ T we have E[S(u)] = S(T )eµ(u−T ) 7.6 Some sample calculations for the lognormal process. Suppose a stock price process S(t), t ≥ 0 follows a geometric Brownian motion (log- normal process) with expected rate of return (inﬁnitesimal drift) µ = 0.1 and volatility σ = 0.2 (time in years). Suppose the current stock price is S(0) = 50. (i) Find E[S(3)]. Answer: here we have t = 3. We know S(0) = 50 and therefore by the formula from the end of the previous section, E[S(3)] = 50e µt = 50e 0.1×3 = 50e0.3 = 67.49 (ii) What is the expected payoﬀ for a binary call option with maturity in 9 months’ time and strike price 70? Set t = 0.75, then the payoﬀ is 1 if S(t) ≥ 70 and 0 if S(t) < 70. Hence the expected value of the payoﬀ is P [S(t) ≥ 70]. Set c = µ − (σ2/2). Then c = 0.1 − ((0.2) 2/2) = 0.08 3 We have L(0, t) = log ( S(t) S(0) ) ∼ N (ct, σ2t) = N (0.08 × 0.75, 0.04 × 0.75) = N (0.06, 0.03) so that with Z denoting a standard normal we have log ( S(t) S(0) ) = 0.06 + √ 0.03Z and therefore (always with t = 0.75), since 70/50 = 1.4, P [S(t) ≥ 70] = P [log ( S(t) 50 ) ≥ log(1.4)] = P [0.06 + √ 0.03Z ≥ log(1.4)] = P [Z ≥ log(1.4) − 0.06 √0.03 ] = 1 − Φ(1.596) = 1 − 0.9452 = 0.0548 (iii) Find P [S(6) < S(4)]. With c and σ as before, we have that log (S(6) S(4) ) ∼ N (c(6 − 4), σ2(6 − 4)) = N (0.16, 0.08) so that with Z ∼ N (0, 1) we have log ( S(6) S(4) ) = 0.16 + √ 0.08Z and hence P [S(6) < S(4)] = P [ S(6) S(4) < 1 ] = P [log (S(6) S(4) ) < 0 ] = P [0.16 + √ 0.08Z < 0 ] = P [Z < − 0.16 √ 0.08 ] = P [Z < −0.57] = Φ(−0.57) = 1 − Φ(0.57) = 1 − 0.7157 = 0.2843 7.7 More on the lognormal process Another way to understand the behaviour of the lognormal process is in terms of the change in stock price over a small time interval. 4 Suppose the stock price S(t) follows a lognormal process with expected rate of return µ and volatility σ. For t ≥ 0 and h ≥ 0, by the deﬁnition of the lognormal process we have log ( S(t + h) S(t) ) ∼ N ((µ − σ2 2 ) h, σ2h ) so that with Z denoting a standard normal, log ( S(t + h) S(t) ) = (µ − σ2 2 ) h + σ√ hZ and hence S(t + h) S(t) = exp (( µ − σ2 2 ) h + σ√ hZ ) Let Λ(t, h) denote the proportionate increase in the stock price from time t to t + h, i.e. Λ(t, h) = S(t + h) − S(t) S(t) = S(t + h) S(t) − 1. Then Λ(t, h) = exp (( µ − σ2 2 ) h + σ√hZ ) − 1. Using the MacLaurin expansion of the exponential function, for small x we have ex − 1 ≈ x + x2 2 and for h small, we can apply this to x = (µ − (σ2/2))h + σ√ hZ. Ignoring terms of higher order than h we obtain Λ(t, h) ≈ ((µ − σ2 2 ) h + σ√ hZ ) + 1 2 σ2hZ 2 = µh + σZ√h + σ2h 2 (Z 2 − 1) In the above, the ﬁrst term is deterministic. The second term is normal with mean (i.e. expectation) zero and variance σ2h, while the third term is random with mean zero (because E[Z 2] = 1) and much smaller variance than the second term (because it has a factor of h wheareas the second term has a factor of √h). Essentially we can ignore the third term; thus for h small we have Λ(t, h) ≈ µh + σ√ hZ so that approximately, Λ(t, h) ≈ N (µh, σ2h) 5 Often we write dt rather than h for a small increase in time, dS(t) for the increase in stock price over the small time interval from t to t + dt, and dZ (or dW ) for a normal variable with mean 0 and variance dt, independent of what went before; with this notation we have dS(t) S(t) = Λ(t, dt) = µdt + σdZ which we may write as dS S = µdt + σdZ or just dS = µSdt + σSdZ. 6","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
