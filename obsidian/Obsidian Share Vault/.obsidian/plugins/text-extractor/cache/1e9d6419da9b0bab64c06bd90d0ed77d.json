Introduction Under the Rules, scheduled loads are net consumers of electricity that register to participate in the central dispatch and pricing processes operated by AEMO. For the purposes of economic scheduling of electricity to meet demand, scheduled loads are essentially treated on equal terms with scheduled generating units with no dispatch models designed to favour scheduling from one type of unit over another. In this document the models described for scheduled loads equally apply for scheduled generating units unless otherwise specified. Furthermore, the same participant interfaces are available for the bidding, dispatch and market reporting of scheduled generating units and scheduled loads. However, market participants with registered scheduled loads should specifically be aware of:  The expected structure of their dispatch bids and how the central dispatch process interprets these bids;  Market ancillary services offer data and how the central dispatch process interprets this data;  The other data required by the central dispatch process;  Modelling in the dispatch algorithm that is specific to scheduled loads;  The interpretation of load dispatch instructions. © AEMO 2019 | GUIDE TO SCHEDULED LOADS 5 2. Dispatch Inputs 2.1 Energy Bids Clause 3.8.7 of the Rules covers the structure of dispatch bids. A sample dispatch bid structure for a scheduled load is illustrated in Figure 1 below. The components of a dispatch bid are described in the following sections. This is followed by a worked example explaining how the dispatch bid is used in the central dispatch process. Figure 1 Typical Dispatch Bid for scheduled load 2.2 Energy Bands A market participant must submit a scheduled load’s maximum capacity in ten price bands in the daily energy bid. Each price band associates a quantity of electricity consumption at the load’s local connection point with a local price for the scheduling of that quantity of electricity. The price specified for a price band for a normally-off scheduled load is interpreted in the central dispatch process as the market clearing price at or below which the scheduled load will increase electricity consumed by up to the MW increment specified in that price band. (For a normally-on scheduled load the converse is true: the band price is interpreted as the clearing price above which the scheduled load will reduce electricity consumption.) Restated, each band price represents the maximum market clearing price that the market participant is willing to pay before decreasing the electricity consumption of their scheduled load by up to the MW increment in that band for the specified trading interval. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 02004006008001000 Price ($/MW) Electricity Consumption (MW) Total Band MW equal to Max Capacity 1000MW Metered MW Unit Availability = 500MW BANDS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Ramp Down Rate x 5 Ramp Up Rate x 5 Dispatch Clearing Price $55 © AEMO 2019 | GUIDE TO SCHEDULED LOADS 6 Under clause 3.8.7(h) of the Rules all band prices for scheduled loads (when referred to the relevant regional reference node via their transmission loss factor) must be:  Less than or equal to the Market Price Cap; and  Greater than or equal to the Market Floor Price. 2.3 Energy Availability The maximum electrical consumption by a scheduled load that can be scheduled for the specified trading interval. 2.4 Energy Ramp Rates The maximum rates (in MW/min) at which the electrical consumption by a scheduled load can be scheduled to increase (called the ramp up rate) or decrease (called the ramp down Rate) over the specified trading interval. 2.5 Energy Fixed Loading The fixed level of electricity consumption by a scheduled load (in MW) to be scheduled for the specified trading interval. 2.6 Fast Start Inflexibility (On-line Dispatch only) A scheduled load registered as a fast start unit may submit a fast start inflexibility profile (FSIP). This FSIP mode time and minimum loading level data represents the desired consumption profile that the scheduled load wishes to be automatically committed to by the on-line dispatch algorithm if it is economic to do so, as determined in a first-pass fast start unit commitment dispatch calculation. This first-pass calculation assumes that all FSIP constraints that are normally applied to committed Fast Start units are ignored for the purposes of determining further unit commitments. 2.7 Daily Energy Constraint (Pre-dispatch only) The maximum energy consumption by a scheduled load (in MW) that can be scheduled over the specified trading day. © AEMO 2019 | GUIDE TO SCHEDULED LOADS 7 3. FCAS Offers A market participant may register a scheduled load to provide any of the frequency control ancillary services (FCAS). Typically a scheduled load is only able to provide the fast (6 second), slow (60 seconds) & delayed (5 minute) frequency raise contingency services, providing a response to a sudden frequency increase through automatic under-frequency load shedding. Once a market participant has registered a scheduled load for any of these FCAS, the market participant must submit a daily FCAS offer for that service, in a similar format to energy market dispatch bids. The FCAS offer band price is the price (in $/MWh) that the market participant is willing to accept in return for enabling the amount of FCAS MW response within that FCAS offer band. 3.1 Interpretation of a Dispatch Bid - a worked example Reference: Figure 1 above. For this example, assume that the scheduled load ‘X’ belongs to a region ‘R’. Also assume that the maximum capacity for load ‘X’ = 1000 MW. The sum of band MW in all 10 bands must therefore equal 1000 MW. The dispatch bid submitted for load ‘X’ has: Bands 1 to 8 have 620 MW priced below $50/MWh Band 9 has 190 MW at $70/MWh Band 10 has 190 MW at $80/MWh Availability = 500 MW Ramp up & down Rate = 20 MW/minute At the start of the dispatch run, the metered MW consumption of load ‘X’ = 290 MW. The NEMDE solver algorithm then determines the upper and lower limits within which load ‘X’ can be scheduled to consume: Upper limit = minimum of (Ramp Upper limit, Availability) = minimum (390, 500) = 390 MW where; Ramp upper limit = Metered MW + ramp Up rate x 5 mins = 290 + (20 x 5) = 390 MW Lower limit = Ramp lower limit = Metered MW - Ramp down rate x 5 mins = 190 MW © AEMO 2019 | GUIDE TO SCHEDULED LOADS 8 The NEMDE solver optimisation then calculates for the trading interval and determines that a market clearing price (spot price) for region ‘R’ of $55/MWh. As the price of Band 10 is greater than the spot price, this band is fully scheduled with consumption of 190 MW. As the price of Band 9 is also greater than the spot price, a further 190 MW of consumption is scheduled. At this stage the total consumption of Bands 9 and 10 = 380 MW which is still within the upper and lower limits determined above. However, the remaining bands are not dispatched at all, as their band prices are all below the spot price (that is, the market price was not low enough to justify consumption in those bands). Therefore, the final scheduled consumption (dispatch target) of load ‘X’= 380 MW. The NEMDE solver algorithm has scheduled an increase in the consumption of the load from 290 MW, dispatching from the higher-priced to lower-priced bands until either the spot price falls below the price of the last band dispatched (as in this case) or the scheduled load is constrained to either its upper or lower operating limits. 4. Other data 4.1 SCADA metered energy consumption Clause 3.8.2(d) of the Rules requires that certain facilities be provided before a load can participate in the central dispatch process as a scheduled load: “(d) Dispatch bids and market ancillary service offers will only be included in the central dispatch process by AEMO if it is satisfied that adequate communication and/or telemetry is available to support the issuing of dispatch instructions and the audit of responses.” The current metered value of consumption of the scheduled load is required by the On-line dispatch process in order to determine the feasible dispatch target at the end of each trading interval and to allow AEMO to verify conformance of the scheduled load to its dispatch target. These values are automatically captured from the AEMO SCADA database at the start of each on-line dispatch, 5MPD & pre-dispatch run. A means of transmitting dispatch instructions to the scheduled load is also required. There are similar requirements on scheduled generating units to provide currently metered outputs and data communications facilities. 5. Dispatch Process The central dispatch process equitably applies the same dispatch rules and principles to both scheduled generating units and scheduled loads. 5.1 Co-optimisation of Energy and FCAS Dispatch Under Clause 3.8.1(b) of the Rules: “(b) The central dispatch process should aim to maximise the value of spot market trading i.e. to maximise the value of dispatched load based on dispatch bids less the combined cost of dispatched generation based on generation dispatch offers, dispatched network services based on network © AEMO 2019 | GUIDE TO SCHEDULED LOADS 9 dispatch offers, and dispatched market ancillary services based on market ancillary service offers subject to: (1) dispatch offers, dispatch bids and market ancillary service offers; … “ The value of dispatched load equals (dispatched load x dispatch bid band price, as referred to regional reference node), summed for all scheduled loads. In accordance with the objective of maximising the value of spot market trading, the energy and FCAS bands of scheduled loads and scheduled generating units are jointly scheduled to determine the least cost/greatest value way of satisfying both the energy demand and FCAS requirements for all regions. Note that the scheduled amounts of energy and FCAS are jointly limited to the FCAS offer trapezium constraints as defined in the relevant FCAS offer for that trading interval. The total FCAS enabled from a scheduled load is limited to the FCAS Maximum Availability in its FCAS offer. Energy dispatch plus FCAS enabled from a scheduled load must be less than the FCAS Enablement Maximum in its FCAS offer. Energy dispatch less FCAS enabled from a scheduled load must be greater than the FCAS Enablement Minimum in its FCAS offer. 5.2 Normally-on versus Normally-off status A scheduled load is registered as either normally-on or normally-off. The classification by AEMO of whether a scheduled load is either normally-on or normally-off is based on whether the metered consumption of that load has been included as a component of the metered demand calculation for the associated region. If the metered consumption of the load has been included (as that load is typically consuming power), then this load is defined to be normally-on - otherwise it is normally-off. The NEMDE solver algorithm schedules generation and load to meet the forecast non-dispatchable demand in each region. The pre-dispatch process uses the normal operating status information for loads in the adjustment of the pre-dispatch demand forecast to determine non-dispatchable demand. As it is assumed that the pre-dispatch demand forecasts provided by AEMO are based upon historical records which include the metered demand of normally-on scheduled loads, then for each trading interval the pre-dispatch process must firstly subtract the total bid availability of all normally-on scheduled loads in the region from the pre- dispatch demand forecast for that region. This adjustment assumes that the bid availability of a normally-on scheduled load closely reflects the metered demand of that load. 5.3 Energy Ramp Rates Energy ramp up and ramp down rates are converted by the NEMDE dispatch algorithm into respective upper and lower constraints on the electricity consumption that can be scheduled on a scheduled load by the end of the trading interval. The upper bound is the initial consumption at the start of a trading interval plus the maximum amount by which that initial consumption can increase over the interval, as indicated by the ramp up Rate multiplied by the number of minutes in the interval. © AEMO 2019 | GUIDE TO SCHEDULED LOADS 10 The lower bound is the initial consumption at the start of a trading interval less the maximum amount by which that initial consumption can decrease over the interval, as indicated by the ramp down rate multiplied by the number of minutes in the interval. 5.4 Energy Band Price Tie-breaking If two scheduled loads in the same region have the same referred band price and these two bands are marginally dispatched, then the price tie-breaking model calculates the sharing of load between the two bands. This is done by pro rating the scheduled load band MW in proportion to the total MW available from the price-tied bands. It should be noted that there are limitations to this procedure. The bands must be in the same region and they must both belong to scheduled generating units or both belong to scheduled loads. Furthermore, there are no tie-breaking rules applied to price-tied FCAS offers. 5.5 Fast Start Commitment & Dispatch (On-line Dispatch only) The fast start commitment, decommitment and inflexibility profile constraints are applied in on-line dispatch and five-minute pre-dispatch. A fast start scheduled load is committed (that is, commences to follow its bid FSIP) on the first occasion that a non-zero energy consumption target is calculated by the first-pass fast start commitment calculation of the central dispatch process. The scheduled load then: 1. Prepares to be loaded over the T1 mode time (during which time the consumption targets are zero MW), 2. Ramps up its consumption to its minimum loading level over the T2 mode time, at the rate calculated as minimum loading level / T2 time, 3. Is constrained to consume at or above its minimum loading level over T3 mode time, 4. Is constrained to consume at or above a calculated minimum loading level which reduces from the minimum loading level down to zero MW over T4 Mode time. On completion of T4 mode time the fast start scheduled load is decommitted on the first occasion that a zero energy consumption target is calculated by the central process, and is then prepared to be re-committed in subsequent central dispatch runs. Note that a fast start scheduled load cannot set market energy price while operating in inflexible loading modes 0 (off-line), 1 or 2. Also note that a fast start scheduled load is subject to any overriding energy ramp rates while operating in Modes 3 or 4. Scheduled loads (both normally-on and normally-off) are treated in same way as scheduled generating units under this model. Also note that the fast start design only provides for a minimum consumption time (T3 time), not a maximum consumption time nor a maximum or minimum off-time (all of which must be handled by the market participant through re-bidding). The fast start dispatch process is designed to automatically send a unit commitment instruction to the owner of a fast start unit to advise that it is now economically viable for that scheduled load to commence upon a participant-specified pattern of electricity consumption (its fast start inflexibility profile) given the current market price and level of demand. Note however that the registered normal operating status of a scheduled © AEMO 2019 | GUIDE TO SCHEDULED LOADS 11 load is not used in the fast start dispatch decision process, and both the normally-on and normally-off types of scheduled loads can participate equally in the fast start commitment decision and dispatch process. Clearly if a market participant bids a scheduled load so that the resulting dispatch exhibits a scheduled consumption pattern similar to that of a normally-on load (that is, bids with at least one band price always greater than market price) then the current fast start model is not likely to ever be activated for that type of load. 5.6 Daily Energy Constraint (Pre-dispatch only) Daily energy constraints are used only in pre-dispatch to limit the total amount of energy consumption that can be scheduled on an energy-constrained scheduled load from the start of the trading day onwards. 5.7 Market Pricing As the price bands of scheduled loads can be marginally or partially dispatched by the NEMDE solver algorithm, bands so dispatched are able to set the market price (either energy or any FCAS) for a trading interval. 6. Reporting 6.1 Energy Dispatch Target (Total Cleared) Scheduled load energy targets scheduled by the on-line dispatch process represent the amount of electricity consumption (in MW) that is required for a normally-on or normally-off scheduled load for the specified trading interval. These targets are confidentially reported to the relevant market participant in electronically transmitted text files updated after every dispatch run. Scheduled energy consumption profiles that are determined in 5MPD and pre-dispatch are indicative forecasts only. Note that the NEMDE solver algorithm employs linear programming techniques to solve. Therefore the reported dispatch targets for both scheduled generating units and scheduled loads are of a continuous nature rather than being integer values. This means that for a scheduled load that naturally exhibits a quantised loading response to dispatch instructions (such as a pump) it becomes more important to construct bids so that the dispatch process is unlikely to schedule partial loading within any bands of that unit. This can be achieved, for example, through pricing bands sufficiently away from the likely market clearing price. 6.2 FCAS Enabling Targets Scheduled load FCAS raise enabling targets scheduled by the on-line dispatch process represent the amount of electricity consumption (in MW) on a normally-on or normally-off scheduled load that is required to be armed (enabled) and ready to automatically shed in the event of a defined power system frequency fall for the specified trading interval. These targets are again confidentially reported to the relevant market participant in electronically transmitted text files updated after every dispatch run. Scheduled FCAS enabling targets that are determined in 5MPD and pre-dispatch are again indicative forecasts only. © AEMO 2019 | GUIDE TO SCHEDULED LOADS 12 Table 1 REFERENCES TO DISPATCHABLE LOADS IN SPD FORMULATION SECTION OR EQN TOPIC DESCRIPTION 2.7 Quotes Dispatchable load bids, represented by LDOF, are made by energy customers, which can be energy consumers or retailers. 2.9 Security Measures Dispatchable loads are used in generic constraints. 3.1 Objective Function There are Ramp Rate & Trader Bid constraint violation penalties defined for dispatchable loads.
