ARTIC L E I NF O Keywords: Lithium battery Online SoH estimation Gaussian process regression Signal processing Frequency domain and time health indicator Battery health diagnosis and prognosis ABSTRAC T Lithium-ion batteries are considered as promising electric energy storage systems. However, identiﬁcation of battery health is a critical issue. Furthermore, battery aging extremely depends on operating conditions. Therefore, monitoring and analysis of battery health degradation in real-time systems such as electric vehicles, in which a variety of stress factors may come into play, are demanded. This paper proposes a data-driven algorithm based on multiple condition indicator to estimate battery health using application-based load proﬁles. In this regard, battery cells have been cycled under a worldwide light duty driving test cycle (WLTC) load proﬁle in laboratory to acquire real-world driving data. Time-domain and frequency-domain condition indicators are extracted from measured on-board data like voltage and current within certain time intervals, enabling real-time investigation of battery health degradation. The condition indicators have been fed into a Gaussian process estimator to track the real-time state of health (SoH). As degradation strongly depends on magnitude of input current, it is important that the proposed method can predict health of the cell regardless of current amplitude and aging pattern. Therefore, to assess accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, it is validated using a diﬀerent load proﬁle with distinct depth of discharge, current amplitude, and distinctive aging pattern. Results reveal the proposed approach is highly precise and is capable of estimating battery SoH with low computational costs and a relative error of less than 1%. The proposed technique is promising for online diagnostics of battery health thanks to its high accuracy and robustness. 1. Introduction The penetration of lithium-ion batteries in the market has increased in recent years due to their unique characteristics such as high energy density, high cell voltage, low self-discharge rate and long cycle cap- ability; these make them a promising alternative for stationary storage systems and automotive applications [1]. However, battery perfor- mance degrades over time as a result of irreversible processes such as capacity fade and the formation of solid-electrolyte interphase(SEI) [2]; therefore, to improve battery reliability and availability there is an ever-increasing need for accurate, early and online battery health di- agnosis. To this end, many eﬀorts have been devoted to developing reliable methods for health diagnosis and prognostics in lithium-ion batteries. For instance, a fault diagnosis method was proposed for battery system in electric vehicles based on big data analysis methods in [3]. The authors in [4] have reviewed experimental and adaptive techniques for battery health diagnosis and prognostics; the data driven methods for remaining useful life prognostics is found in [5].

T diagnostics and prognostics approaches can be classiﬁed into two ca- tegories: principle modelling and data-driven methods. Principle modelling approaches, such as the Kalman ﬁltering and particle ﬁltering models, focus on developing the physics-based model of battery degradation by characterizing the physical relationship be- tween the model parameters and the electrochemical process aﬀecting the aging of the battery. For instance, Satadru et al. introduced a model for fault diagnosis by employing a two-state thermal model to describe the dynamics of the surface and core temperature of a battery cell [6]. In [7], a battery health monitoring approach was developed using a double polarisation model taken from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A particle ﬁltering framework was designed by Dalal et al. using the lumped parameter battery model in order to im- plement a prognostic method for lithium-ion batteries [8]. The authors in [9] also provided a prognosis model based on the Rao-Black- wellisation particle ﬁlter. Li et al. also used an incremental capacity analysis to estimate SoH. They proposed a model based on charging curve and focused on deduction and validation of charged capacity vs. voltage model [10]. These prognostic and diagnostic techniques based on principle models are accurate; however, they can impose computa- tional complexity on the system due to their need for parameter in- itialization. Data-driven methods, including statistical approaches and machine learning approaches, do not require any domain knowledge about battery aging, but they do rely on immense amounts of observed data describing the aging behaviour of the battery. Statistical analysis, such as Markov modelling or sample entropy, has been applied by researchers to estimate state-of-health (SoH) and state-of-charge (SoC) in lead-acid batteries [11]. Similarly, Yishan et al. proposed a method for online health monitoring of batteries using Markov models [12]. Yang et al. also utilized statistical analysis to determine battery fault in electric vehicles [13]. Machine learning techniques, such as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), relevance vector machine (RVM), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), are widely applied for prognostic and diagnostic problems in lithium-ion batteries. For in- stance, Gae-Won et al. [14] exploited ANN approach to track SoH on the ﬂy by using, measurable BMS data such as current, voltage and temperature. Approaches using ANN are capable of high nonlinear approximation, hence they are adapted to estimate lithium battery degradation [15,16], but they need a large data set and the probability that they will stuck in the local minimum [5]. In contrast, SVM only requires a small training sample and has been adopted by many re- searchers for tracking battery health [17]. As an example, authors in [18] designed a multistage SVM approach for estimating battery re- maining useful life. They extracted set of critical features from battery cycling data and combined classiﬁcation and regression method to track battery health; nevertheless, the SVM method suﬀers from a lack of uncertainty management and sparsity. More importantly, the number of support vectors is highly dependent on the error boundary [19].To cope with the drawbacks of SVM, Datong et al. investigate the prog- nostics and diagnostics of lithium batteries’ health using RVM [20]. Yang et al. proposed RVM technique to predict battery RUL [21]. Their proposed method focused on combining unscented Kalman ﬁlter and RVM with the thought of error-correction. The GPR technique is a non-linear and non-parametric machine learning approach based on Bayesian theory. Bayesian-based methods provide the uncertainty management associated with prediction, making them appropriate for high dimension problems [22]. As a re- sult, many researchers have adapted GPR for battery prognostics and diagnostics [23,24]. Authors in [25] proposed a GPR model to for- mulated a health transition model to estimate capacity changes be- tween the periods of usage and predict future capacity and associated uncertainty. Robert et al. demonstrated the capability of GPR technique in prediction capacity fade [22]. In this study, this approach is also selected as a battery health estimator. It should be noted that data-driven approaches can demonstrate degradation-inherent relationships by detecting and extracting pro- mising features. Hence, in order to develop an eﬀective diagnosis and prognostic approach for lithium-ion batteries, their characteristic parameters should be investigated to generate the condition indicators from which the state and process of battery health degradation can be distinguished. Importantly, extracting the condition indicators reduces the amount of measured data and computational costs [26]. In general, battery condition indicators fall into two main cate- gories: internal and processed. Internal condition indicators are the features of a battery that can be obtained by state estimation or para- meter estimation, such as internal resistance, capacity and the SoC [27]. For instance, Pan et al. [26] considered the increase of ohmic internal and polarised internal resistance of the Thevenin model as a promising degradation feature for tracking the SoH of the battery. The authors in [28] determined that the relationship between coulombic eﬃciency and capacity degradation is a condition indicator for SoH estimation. However, the internal condition indicators principally rely on the measurements of battery characteristics under static conditions such as full charge and discharge or measuring charge and discharge capacity in the same cycles. Moreover, the model parameters should be calcu- lated oﬄine, which means they do not satisfy the requirements of on- line applications. The processed condition indicators are features of the battery ex- tracted from available monitoring data such as current, voltage, and temperature. For instance, the mean voltage falloﬀ was proposed by Yapeng et al. as the features of interest for estimating battery remaining useful life (RUL) [29]. These condition indicators are also obtained by applying signal processing methods such as incremental capacity ana- lysis (ICA) and diﬀerential voltage (dV/dQ) analysis (DVA). For in- stance, authors in [30] took the positions of peaks in incremental ca- pacity (IC) curves as condition indicators to track the SOH of the battery module and battery packs in the EVs. Limei et al. used two inﬂection points from the location interval of the diﬀerential voltage (DV) curve as the SoH indicator [31]. The IC and DV peaks at various aging states have exclusive amplitudes and positions that can be suitable for mon- itoring the health of lithium-ion batteries even during partial cycling of the batteries. However, such peaks can be identiﬁed only within a particular range of the SoC, i.e. around 40% in dQ/dV and around 70% in dQ/dF, which makes them inconvenient indicators to predict the health state of a battery within the whole range of the SoC [32].A recent study has indicated there is a correlation between battery health and various condition indicators extracted from voltage data [33]. They investigated the impact of each condition indicators in battery health monitoring and fed them as an input to an incremental support vector regression (ISVR) model. It is notable, despite the fact that battery health condition is ex- tremely depending on the application which it has been subjected to, many contributions have not investigated battery condition indicators under an online operating condition. Therefore, the present study aims to ﬁll this gap by seeking battery behavior under a real operating condition, in which a variety of stress factors can come into play. The main contribution of this study is to develop a novel battery health diagnosis method under a realistic condition in which an EV operates. This is achieved by proposing a promising set of condition indicators not only in time-domain but also in frequency domain from battery’s current and voltage data, acquired by applying Worldwide Light duty driving Test Cycle (WLTC) to the cells. These indicators will be assigned in order to predict the general health of the battery, not the eﬀects caused by main and side reactions. Making a link between side reaction and aging is out of the scope of this paper and needs an equipped chemical lab. Condition indicators are fed to the GPR model to identify the cor- relation between the condition indicators and battery health. In this way, the degradation of the battery cells will be investigated under more realistic conditions. S. Khaleghi, et al. Applied Energy 255 (2019) 113813 2 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows; Section 2 will focus on the process of proposed battery health diagnosis method in- cluding data pre-processing, condition indicators extraction, condition indicator selection, and the GPR model. The experimental results will be discussed in Section 3 and ﬁnally, in Section 4, summary of ﬁndings and the conclusion will be presented. 2. Battery health analytics process The details of a proposed battery health analysis are discussed next. The proposed method for this study includes the fundamental steps of data acquisition, data pre-processing, information discovery, and training the prediction model as depicted in Fig. 1. The acquired data are manipulated and prepared in the data pre-processing step then forwarded to the information discovery block to extract the condition indicators. After evaluation, the most promising indicators are selected to be the input of a regression model. The regression model is used to diagnose battery health based on the chosen indexes. The following subsections explain these steps in detail. 2.1. Data acquisition In this study, a worldwide light duty driving test cycle (WLTC) proﬁle was adopted for evaluating the impact of real-life driving cycles under realistic conditions in which an EV operates. The descriptions of the WLTC proﬁle are depicted in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the WLTC proﬁle represents a 30-minute trip divided in two parts of 15 min each. The ﬁrst of the driving cycle represents the urban driving con- dition, and the second part is considered the driving condition of the extra-urban driver. This proﬁle was also used in a previous study for dynamic proﬁle validation [34]. This study illustrates that the WLTC fulﬁlls the requirements of a real driving proﬁle for EVs. It is notable that non-accelerated tests are time-consuming processes and impose tremendous costs. In an accelerated test, however, cycling is enhanced, and storage time is reduced. The test was conducted using the lithium Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt oxide (NMC), a pouch cell, with a rated nominal capacity of 20Ah. The general characteristics of the battery are summarized in Table 2. For the sake of this study, two cells (Cell A and Cell B) were cycled based on an accelerated cyclic test using WLTC proﬁles. The current proﬁle for Cell A is depicted in Fig. 2. As shown, the accelerated driving test was conducted based on ﬁve WLTC trips in a row with a single regular extent at one point after driving. Each cycle (in red in Fig. 2) corresponds to 15% DOD with 75% in total. Furthermore, the SOC window will be limited to 10–90% as recommended by several EV manufacturers. However, for cell B, the proﬁle focuses on the impact of current. The driving proﬁle for cell B is depicted in Fig. 3. The cycle includes only the sub-urban part and is repeated 4 times in an hour. The main idea is to have a more aggressive cycle to observe the impact of current on aging and compare it with cell A, for which a higher SoC window and lower current values characterize the proﬁle. For both cells, the overall test was conducted based on 12 cycles a day at 45 °C and the voltage and current signals were recorded for further analysis. A periodic capacity test was also performed after speciﬁc numbersData Pre-processing Acquired data Information Discovery Process CIs Developing a predictive model Train a model Validate the model Fig. 1.

However, the in- tervals in which the capacity test was conducted are not unique and they are diﬀerent for both cells. The capacity test was performed based on constant-current-constant-voltage (CC-CV) mode using a C-rate of C/ 2 in the charging step until the cut-oﬀ voltage of 4.2 V was reached. The CV step then progressed until the current dropped to 10 mA. The dis- charge was carried out in a constant current of C/2 until the battery voltage fell oﬀ to 3.0 V. To deﬁne the initial cell capacity, a capacity test was carried out at the beginning of life (BOL). The experiment was stopped when the capacity was decreased to 80% of initial capacity and the battery reached its end of life (EOL). Fig. 4 summarizes the entire data acquisition process. 2.2. Data pre-processing step In this step, pre-processing was applied to convert the raw data into a form from which promising features could be extracted. The proces- sing of raw data initially involved applying linear interpolation to the voltage signal with a time sampling of 0.1 s to convert the real-time voltage proﬁle into a harmonic and uniformly sampled signal. Furthermore, because the faults in the battery may accrue at any stage of cycling, battery health monitoring should be exploited in a partial voltage signal for online tracking of the battery's status. By taking this into account, the voltage proﬁle gathered from one full charge and discharge cycle was divided into buﬀers with 10-minute intervals, making it possible to perform monitoring and feature extraction in short periods. Filtering the data is also an eﬀective data processing technique for focusing on a speciﬁc range of the signal from which the features of interest can be extracted. A high-pass ﬁlter has been designed for each voltage buﬀer. Filtering the raw voltage concentrates the analysis on ﬂuctuations in the voltage in absence of the DC part during a cycle of charging and discharging. In other words, passing the raw signal through a ﬁlter is helpful since the AC part of the voltage signal is most likely to demonstrate the features required for constructing health in- dicators. Among all types of well-known methods for designing high- pass ﬁlters, the “Chebyshev” type-2 was selected in this study for de- signing the high-pass ﬁlter. 2.3. Information discovery step In this step, pre-processed data were converted into analytical in- formation. The analytical information is useful for distinguishing normal operation from faulty information and for predicting the re- maining useful life (RUL). The process of information discovery is presented in Fig. 5. Analytical information can be achieved from the condition in- dicators (CIs). Condition indicators are the features of a battery whose behavior changes in a predictable way as the battery degrades or reaches its end of life. 2.3.1. Condition indicators construction In recent years, there have been various works on investigating time-domain and frequency-domain condition indicators for health monitoring of systems. This study is based on the most common con- dition indicators discussed in previous studies [35–38]. Several methods have employed signal processing techniques to extract time-domain and frequency-domain condition indicators from voltage buﬀers. The ﬂow diagram of the construction of condition in- dicators which is used in this study is depicted in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, the selected time-domain features include the statistical elements such as Root Mean Square (RMS), Mean, kurtosis and the covariance between voltage and corresponding current proﬁle. In this paper, these parameters are utilized to indicate the battery de- gradation in time domain. In what follows, these time-domain features Fig. 2. WLTC – accelerated driving proﬁle for cell A. Fig. 3. WLTC driving proﬁle for cell B. For Cell B the proﬁle focuses on impact of higher rate of current and lower SoC window. Fig. 4. Data acquisition procedure from battery testing. S. Khaleghi, et al. Applied Energy 255 (2019) 113813 4 are explained: • Mean: The mean of the signal is deﬁned through Eq. (1) where N is the number of points in the signal x, xn is the n-th point in the of signal x. ∑ =N x 1 n N n 1 (1) • RMS: a signal RMS is deﬁned as the square root of the signal mean square over a period of time and it is formulated as: Fig. 5. Representation of information discovery process. A set of time domain and frequency do- main condition indicators are extracted from pro- cessed voltage signal. These condition indicators are saved in a database. After selecting the optimal condition indicators, the database will be updated. Analytical information about battery health diag- nostics can be achieved from the optimal condition indicators. Fig. 6. Flow diagram of condition indicator construction. The gray boxes indicate the condition indicators. S. Khaleghi, et al. Applied Energy 255 (2019) 113813 5 ∑= = x N x 1 RMS n N n 1 2 (2) where xRMS is the RMS level of the signal x, =⋯n N1, , denotes the n-th data sampled, and N is the total number of points in data-set x. • Kurtosis: kurtosis deﬁnes how outlier-prone a distribution or data- set is. The kurtosis is deﬁned as: = ∑ − ∑ − = = k Nx μ xμ .( ) (( ) ) n N n n N n 1 4 1 2 2 (3) where k is kurtosis, N is the number of points in signal x, xn is the n-th point in the time-history of signal x and μ is deﬁned as the mean of signal x. • Covariance: in some cases, the covariance between two time-series variables of the system can identify the health condition of the system. For two time-series variables, the covariance is deﬁned as: ∑= − −× − = cov X Y N xμ y μ(, ) 1 1 () ( ) i N i X i Y 1 (4) where μX is the mean of X and μY is the mean of Y , N is the number of points in the signal X and Y , xi and yi are the i-th points in the time- history of signal X and Y respectively. Frequency-domain features are acquired using spectrum analyses such as discrete Fourier transform and power spectral density (PSD) to frequency representation of the signal. The power spectral of a time series signal describes the distribution of power into frequency com- ponents composing that signal. In this study, the PSD is the adopted method for converting the time-domain signal to the frequency-domain signal. Furthermore, among all PSD methods, such as periodogram, Welch's method and multi-taper method (MTM), the Welch method is opted for the purpose of this research. The Welch’s method is considered as the modiﬁed periodogram which ﬁrstly splits the time domain signal into S segments of length L overlapping by Z points. Then, a window function like rectangular window or Kaiser window will be applied to each overlapping segment and the average of all segments’ values will be used for estimation of the PSD. In this paper, a rectangular window is applied for the aver- aging with an overlap of 50%. Using the Welch’s PSD method, the voltage data can be inspected to ﬁnd the peaks. The peaks detected in PSD of voltage buﬀers may have diﬀerent characteristics as the battery degrades (Fig. 7). As illustrated in Fig. 7, the spectral peaks encompass important information regarding battery degradation since the amplitude of them increase as battery degrades. Thus, they can be regarded as condition indicators In addition to the PSD analysis, auto-correlation analysis of voltage buﬀers can also reveal diﬀerent patterns between BOL and EOL of the battery. The auto-correlation analysis is considered as correlation of the signal, xt(), with a delayed copy of itself at lag τ [39]. Graphical re- presentation of the auto-correlation function is shown in Fig. 8. The auto-correlation function in the frequency domain is deﬁned by: ∫= ∞ + −∞ R τx t τ x t dt() ( ) ( )x (5) where xt() is the complex conjugate of xt(). Similar to the power spectral peaks, the amplitude of peaks in au- tocorrelation can be used as the frequency-domain condition indicator to represent the status of the battery as depicted in Fig. 9. The spectral measurements are also proven to be promising methods to distinguish healthy signal from the degraded one. Spectral mea- surements consist of power and bandwidth measurements such as power bandwidth (PB), median frequency and occupied bandwidth (OBW), along with, distortion measurements like signal to noise ratio (SNR) and total harmonic distortion (THD). Median frequency ( f )med of a power spectrum is determined as the frequency at which the power density spectrum in two regions have the same amount of power. In other words, 50% of power are at lower frequencies and 50% of the power are at higher frequencies, as shown in Fig. 10. To determine the 3-dB bandwidth and the occupied bandwidth, a Fig. 7. Detected peaks in PSD of voltage buﬀers in diﬀerent stage of battery lifetime. The peaks de- tected in PSD of voltage signal carry important in- formation about the state of battery. To show that the amplitude of PSD peaks can display a pre- dictable pattern as battery degrades, PSD of voltage signal is depicted at three diﬀerent stages of life of battery cell (Beginning of life (100% SoH), midlife (89% SoH) and End of life (80% SoH)). Six highest peaks of PSD at these three stages are also shown. Among these six peaks only two highest peaks are selected as condition indicators. Fig. 8. Graphical representation of auto-correlation function. S. Khaleghi, et al. Applied Energy 255 (2019) 113813 6 periodogram power spectrum estimate is computed using a rectangular window. Afterward, in order to determine the 3-dB bandwidth, the maximum estimate determines a reference level and the bandwidth is derived from the diﬀerence in frequency between the points where the spectrum drops at least 3 dB below the reference level. The occupied bandwidth is described as the diﬀerence in frequency between the points where the integrated power crosses 0.5% and 99.5% of the total power in the spectrum. For computing the SNR and THD of the signal, after converting the signal from time-domain to frequency using PSD, a periodogram func- tion using a Kaiser window is applied to the signal. Then the SNR is derived from the equation: ⎜⎟ ⎜⎟= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢⎛ ⎝ ⎞ ⎠ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ = ⎛ ⎝ ⎞ ⎠ =−SNR log A A log A A AA10 20 ( )dB signal noise signal noise signal dB noise dB10 2 10 ,, (6) whereA is the amplitude in dB. THD is determined from the harmonic frequency of the signal and the fundamental frequency according to the following equation: = ++⋯+ THD VV V V n22 222 1 2 (7) where Vn represents the amplitude of the nth harmonics and =n 1 is the fundamental frequency. The amplitude harmonics and consequently, the THD values change as the battery degrades. In this work, the ﬁrst ﬁve harmonics of the input signal are considered for the sake of the THD analysis. 2.3.2. Condition indicator selection Not all extracted condition indicators display the signiﬁcant impact on battery health diagnostics. Hence, the optimal condition indicators should be selected based on their importance. This increases the per- formance eﬃciency and decreases computational time. According to [40], it is possible to investigate the importance of extracted condition indicators by considering various properties, including monotonicity and trendability. These criteria are used in this study to select optimal condition indicators. Monotonicity, which ranges from 0 (non-monotonic) to 1 (highly monotonic), is deﬁned as: = − − =⋯ +− M xx x i M 1 ,1, , ii (8) where x is the number of total observations in the BOL to EOL trajec- tory and +−xx( )ii is characterized by the positive (negative) ﬁrst deri- vative. Trendability is deﬁned as the minimum of all possible linear cor- relation coeﬃcients between the i-th and j-th BOL to EOL trajectory according to the following equation: == ⋯T corrcoef i j Nmin(| |) , 1, ,ij (9) The importance of a condition indicator is represented according to the following equation: =+IM T (10) In this study, condition indicators are considered promising and, therefore, are selected if their I value is greater than 0.8. 2.3.3. Developing a predictive model To construct and train a regression model that can analyze in- dicators and, in this way, determine the system’s current state, a training dataset is used that comprises the condition indicators ex- tracted from the voltage data. In this study, a data-driven approach based on the Gaussian process is adapted to perform fault diagnosis and prognosis in battery cells. Condition indicators extracted from voltage data are used as the training dataset to construct and train a regression model that can analyze indicators to determine the current state of the system. In this study, a data-driven approach based on the Gaussian process is adapted to perform fault diagnosis and prognosis in the battery cell. Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a nonparametric Bayesian kernel-based probabilistic model. Consider the training set =xy i n{( , ); 1, 2, ..., },i i where ∈xi d and ∈y ,i  are drawn from an unknown distribution. A GPR model addresses the question of pre- dicting the value of a response variable ynew, given the new input vector xnew, and the training data. The output y can be assumed as function of f at input x according to Eq. (11). =+yf X ε() (11) where ∼εN σ(0, )2 is considered as noise term with mean 0 and the error variance σ2. It is assumed that function f X( ) is distributed as a Gaussian process: f xGP μ x k x x() ( (); ( , )) ' (12) where μ x( ) is the mean and kx x(, ) ' is the covariance function. Nor- mally, for the basic GPR, μ x( ) is set to zero and covariance function Fig. 9. Comparison of peak amplitude discovered by auto-correlation analysis in diﬀerent states of battery. The auto-correlation analysis is considered as correlation of the signal, x t(), with a delayed copy of itself at lag τ . The auto correlation has the highest amplitude at zero lag when the signal matches itself exactly. Auto-correlation of voltage signal is depicted at three diﬀerent stages of life of battery cell (Beginning of life (100% SoH), midlife (89% SoH) and End of life (80% SoH)). As ﬁgure indicates, the amplitudes of peaks have ascending pattern throughout battery aging. 5 10 15 20 Frequency (Hz) Power/frequency (dB/Hz) Median Frequency Fig 10.

The hyperparameter θ need to be estimated from the ob- servation data. The kernel parameters are based on the signal standard deviation θf and the characteristic length scale θl. The characteristic length scales brieﬂydeﬁne how far apart the input values xi can be for the response values to become uncorrelated. There are a variety of kernel functions like squared exponential (SE) kernel, exponential (E) kernel, rational quadratic kernel, Matern (M) (5/2) and so on. Among them, three most common kernel functions will be compared and the one with higher prediction accuracy will be se- lected as kernel function of our GPR model. The kernel functions are deﬁned as the following equations: ⎜ ⎟= ⎛ ⎝− ⎞ ⎠ kx x θ θ r θ (, ) exp 2 SE f l ' 2 (13) ⎜ ⎟= ⎛ ⎝− ⎞ ⎠ kx x θ θ r θ (, ) expEf l ' 2 (14) ⎜⎟ ⎜ ⎟= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢⎛ ⎝ ++ ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ ⎞ ⎠⎤ ⎦ ⎥ kx x θ θ r θ r θ r θ (, ) 1 55 3 exp 5 Mf ll l ' 2 2 (15) where θl is the characteristic length scale, and θf is the signal standard deviation and =− −rx x x x() ( )T'' is Euclidean distance be- tween x and x'.

Model validation. Cross-validation is a measurement process to assess the performance of a predictive model, and statistical analysis will be generalized to an independent dataset. There are many types of cross-validation, such as repeated random sub-sampling validation, K- fold cross-validation, K × 2 cross-validations, leave-one-out cross- validation and so on. In this study, K-fold cross-validation is picked up to select para- meters of the model. The K-fold cross-validation is a technique of di- viding the original sample randomly into K sub-samples. Then, a single sub-sample is regarded as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining K-1 sub-samples are used as the training data. These processes are repeated K times and each of the K sub-samples is used exactly once as validation data. The K results from the folds can then be averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation. An example of estimating a turning parameter with K-fold cross-validation is as follows: Step 1: Divide the data K roughly into equal parts; Step 2: For each =⋯i K1, 2, 3, , ﬁt the model with parameter γ or other K-1 parts, giving ̂−α γ( )k and compute its error in predicting the kth part: ̂∑=− ∊ −E γy x α γ() [ ()]k ikthpart i i k 2 (22) This gives the cross-validation error of ∑= = CV γ k Eγ() 1 () i K i 1 (23) Step 3: Do this for various values of γ and choose the value of γ that makes the error CV γ( )smallest. 2.3.3.2. Performance evaluation criteria. To evaluate the performance of the model, some criteria have been adopted from the literature. These criteria include: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R Squared (R2). These statistical parameters are deﬁned as follows: ∑=− = RSME N YY 1 () i N ii 1 2 (24) ∑=− = MSE N YY 1 () i N ii 1 2 (25) ∑=− = MAE N YY 1 |( )| i N ii 1  (26) ∑=→ = − ∑ − ∑ −= = = Y N YR YY YY 1 1 () ()i N i i N ii i N i1 2 1 2 1 2  (27) where N indicates the number of observations, Yi represents the predicted value, Yi deﬁnes the actual measured values, and Y represents the mean response variables. Fig. 11. Aging test results over cycle numbers. As ﬁgure indicates, cell A, have a tendency for faster degradation than cell B. Therefore, the proposed model can be validated using cell B with diﬀerent aging pattern. S. Khaleghi, et al. Applied Energy 255 (2019) 113813 8 3. Experimental results and discussion 3.1. Cell aging results Both cell A and cell B have been cycled until they have been reached to their end of life. The evolution of SOH based on the cycle numbers is shown in Fig. 11. As depicted, the degradation pattern between cell A and B is quite diﬀerent. The cell A, for which a higher SoC window and lower current values characterize the proﬁle, have a tendency for faster degradation than cell B with a higher rate of current. 3.2. Data pre-processing result As explained before, the voltage proﬁles gathered from WLTC cy- cling test conducted in one day has been divided into the buﬀers with 10-minute intervals; therefore, it will be possible to perform the mon- itoring and condition indicators extraction in short periods. The de- signed high pass signal was then applied to each voltage buﬀer. As Fig. 12. Data pre-processing result in voltage proﬁle. Fig. 13. Monotonicity of extracted condition indicators.

Results of information discovery step The buﬀers are then explored to extract the condition indicators, according to the ﬂow diagram 6. Overall, 15 time-domain and fre- quency-domain condition indicators are extracted as candidate condi- tion indicators from each voltage buﬀer. It is notable, the process of condition indicators extraction has been executed on a parallel pool of workers on the multi-core computer in order to decrease the compu- tational time of extraction from all buﬀers. As mentioned earlier, the condition indicators selection step should be followed to select the promising condition indicators. This causes to reduce the computational burden in online applications. This is achieved by evaluating condition indicators’ importance according to monotonicity and Trendability metrics. Figs. 13 and 14 present the monotonicity and Trendability of the candidate condition indicators respectively. The candidate condition indicators are ranked according to their importance based on Eq. (10). As is clear from Fig. 15, the “mean” value is the most promising condition indicator while the features with low importance value have not been considered as the suitable condition indicators in terms of predicting the battery trajectory aging. As an illustrative example, the trajectories of the ﬁrst four promising condition indicators are shown in Fig. 16(a)–(d) with respect to cycle numbers. The last three condition indicators in terms of importance also depicted in Fig. 17(a)–(c). As can be seen, the condition indicators with higher importance ranking (Fig. 16(a)–(d)), present a predictable pattern as the battery degrades, unlike those with lower importance rank (Fig. 17(a)–(c)). In this study, the features with importance value of less than 0.8 will be discarded. 3.4. Gaussian process model This section is devoted to the evaluation of diagnostic model by developing a GPR learner. Two GPR model will be developed to com- pare the inﬂuence of applying the condition indicators selection in the previous section. The ﬁrst model uses the whole database for the con- dition indicators as training input, while the condition indicators with an importance value of less than 0.8 will be discarded from the training dataset for the second model. The battery cell was cycled for I driving proﬁles throughout the ageing experiment and each of them has been divided into L buﬀers. Therefore, the number of whole buﬀers is =×N L I . These buﬀers are explored to extract the condition indicators. Afterwards, =M 15 con- dition indicators are extracted out of each voltage buﬀer. For the ﬁrst GPR model, this ensemble of condition indicators is considered to be a row of input into the vector. Therefore, the input data is considered to be as follows: = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥X xx x x xx x x xx x x ,, , ,, , ,, , M M NN N NM 11 12 13 1 21 22 23 2 12 3 where x indicates the condition indicator. However, for the second GPR Fig. 16. Presentation of 4 high-ranked condition indicators throughout the battery life. S. Khaleghi, et al. Applied Energy 255 (2019) 113813 10 model =M 9. For both models the input data and their related target SoH values ⋯YY Y{, , , }N12 acquired from cell A are regarded as the training dataset =⋯XY i N{( , ), 1,2,3, , }ii . Five-fold cross validation was adopted in both models to assess the performance of the predicted model for untrained data. It is noticeable that a challenging issue in the context of developing a GPR model as a predictive model is selecting the optimal kernel regression function. Herein, the performance of various types of kernel functions, as explained in Section 2.3.3, are also assessed in both models. Three kernel functions, namely the squared exponential (SE), exponential (E) and Matern 5/2 (M 5/2) are selected to compare their prediction accuracy. The performance results of the two models are shown in Table 3. The performances of the two GPR models are compared in terms of their prediction accuracy as well as computational cost. The computa- tional cost, including the time spent on extracting the condition in- dicators and GPR training, was obtained by employing the algorithms ﬁve times and averaging the computational time. It should be noted that the computational costs for all the kernel functions are very minor Fig. 17. Representation of condition indicators with low feature importance through the battery aging trajectory. Table 3 Comparison of two GPR models in the context of three kernel functions. The ﬁrst GPR model was fed by all condition indicators and the second one uses the subset of condition indicators as input data. Model 1 Model 2 Kernel SE E M (5/2) SE E M (5/2) RMSE 0.29 0.28 0.26 0.21 0.21 0.18 Computational cost (s) 7.41 4.51 Fig. 18. SoH estimation results of cell B. S. Khaleghi, et al. Applied Energy 255 (2019) 113813 11 and so we skip a comparison of the computational costs for various kernel functions. Table 3 reveals that the model 2 in which the selection of condition indicators was used as training input is superior to model 2 in terms of accuracy and computational cost. This particularly is important in on- line applications where the computational cost is of great importance. Moreover, the results determine that the diﬀerence between the per- formances of three kernel functions in both models is negligible, the (M 5/2) however, outperforms to other kernel functions. So, model 2 was selected as our prediction model. Table 3 reveals that model 2, in which selecting the condition in- dicators was used as training input, is superior to model 2 in terms of its accuracy and computational cost. This is particularly important in on- line applications where the computational cost is of great importance. Moreover, the results determine that the diﬀerence between the per- formances of the three kernel functions in both models is negligible; (M 5/2), however, outperforms the other kernel functions. Therefore, model 2 was selected as our prediction model. Subsequently, the trained model was validated based on two sets of measurements: one was acquired from cell B and the other from un- trained cycles of cell A. The predictions result and residuals for cell A and cell B are depicted in Figs. 18 and 19 respectively. As can be seen, the SoH can be tracked closely for the new cell’s data with a diﬀerent aging behavior. Table 4 lists the estimation errors based on the error criteria which were discussed before. According to Table 4, the RMSE results for untrained data are less than 0.6. This demonstrates that the proposed method for establishing the health diagnostics of a battery provides a precise estimation result. 3.5. Discussion This section is devoted to study the eﬃciency of the proposed fea- ture model on predicting battery health. Many studies tend to use the sophisticated prediction model in order to improve the prediction performance. However, if a set of promising condition indicator model would be available, the simple regression model can achieve a pro- mising result. Herein, two predictive models namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and decision tree have been selected to investigate the capability of proposed condition indicators in predicting the SoH. Similar to the GPR model which have been discussed in the previous section, the SVM and decision tree have been trained based on the input data of cell A and their performance are evaluated for predicting SoH of cell B. The results are summarized in Table 5. As can be seen, both prediction models perform properly for SoH prediction. This indicates the proposed condition indicators are pro- mising in order to track the SoH of the battery. 4. Conclusion and future work In this study, a data-driven approach is proposed for SoH’s online diagnostics. The proposed approach focuses on battery degradation assessment under a realistic and diﬀerent driving pattern. To this end, two distinct worldwide light duty driving test cycle (WLTC)WLTC proﬁles have been adopted, which are very close to a real electric ve- hicle operation. The signal processing techniques have been applied to the voltage buﬀers to extract the condition indicators. The condition indicators have been investigated to select a subset of condition in- dicators that imply a lower computational burden and higher accuracy in the context of predicting the battery health trajectory. For this pur- pose, the condition indicators have been ranked based on the metrics called monotonicity and trendability. Those indicators with an im- portance rank of 0.8 have been selected as input data for our predictive model. A Gaussian process regression model is used to capture the correspondence between the condition indicators and SoH. The results show that SoH can be precisely traced using the proposed method with a root mean square error of less than 0.6. This contribution could be considered the ﬁrst step toward developing an integrated real-time predictive maintenance (PM) program in a battery management system, which targets health diagnosis and multi-steps-ahead prediction of the remaining useful life of a battery. However, the fundamental challenge in developing such a program is lack of real electric vehicle battery data under diﬀerent operational conditions. The concept of digital twins has recently been introduced to solve this problem by generating artiﬁcial data. Therefore, the future contribution will focus on developing digital twins of batteries to support a real-time data-driven approach for the predictive maintenance of batteries.
