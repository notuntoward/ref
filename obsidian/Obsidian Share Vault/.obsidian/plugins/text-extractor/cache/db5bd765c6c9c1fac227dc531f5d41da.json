Canm) Singlechamber Cardiac Pacing with Two Forms of Respiration-controlled Rate- responsive Pacemaker* Chu-Pak Lau, M.B., M.R.C.P (U.K.);t David E. Ward, M.D.; and A. John Camm, M.D. Ventilatory changes correlate with the heart rate response during exercise, and such changes have been used to determine an appropriate chronotropic response in the Biorate (RDP3 and MB-i) and Meta pacemakers, both of which use a thoracic impedance measurement principle. Ten patients with the Biorate and 11 patients with the Meta were studied. In both groups, significant rate response and improvement in exercise duration compared with fixed rate ventricular pacing were achieved during symptom-limited treadmill exercise tests, with good correlations between the I n patients with complete heart block with normal sinoatrial function, dual chamber pacing can main- thin atrioventricular synchrony and provide for chrono- tropic response during exercise. However, its use can be limited in patients with sinoatrial disease, which has been reported to be associated with complete heart block in 30 to 40 percent of patients.’\u00002 Also, atrial sensing can predispose to the development of pacemaker-mediated tachycardia.3 Although the use of a long atrial refractory period can reduce this problem, this leads to a limitation of the upper rate response of the pacemaker. Thus, in a subset of patients, dual chamber pacing may not be the ideal pacing method. Karlof’ has shown that during maximal exercise, cardiac output is mainly determined by an appropriate chronotropic response rather than by maintaining atrioventricular synchrony. This was subsequently sub- stantiated by comparing the exercise tolerance with dual chamber pacing and rate-matched ventricular pacing using the method of external triggering of implanted pacemakers.56 In patients with already elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure, the atrial contribution to cardiac output becomes less impor- tant.7 Thus, single chamber cardiac pacing, which automatically adjusts the pacing rate during exercise, is an alternative method of physiologic pacing in such patients. The important determinant is a sensor of physiologic demand. Pacemakers sensing the QT interval8 and body vibrations during exercise\u0000” al- ready have been introduced into clinical use. pacing rate and estimated oxygen consumption. Motion artefacts affected the measured impedance of both pace- makers, with rate response occurring during arm move- ments in the absence ofrespiratory activity. This observation suggested that both pacemakers have the potential of activity sensing. The earlier version of the Biorate (RDP3) was limited by myopotential interference, and erosion of the auxiliary lead can be problematic in some patients. (Chest 1989; 95:352-58) Ventilatory response during exercise parallels work- load up to 70 percent of maximum oxygen consump- tion.’2’5 Above this anaerobic threshold,’6”7 accumu- lation of lactic acid increases the minute ventilation at a rate in excess ofoxygen uptake.

In this study, the chronotropic responses ofboth forms of respiratory-sensing pacemaker were compared, and the complications encountered were reported.

The Meta pace- maker only recently has been available for clinical trial. In this article, we present our initial experience with this form of rate-responsive pacing. PACEMAKER DESCRIPTION The Biorate Pacemaker Rossi et al\u0000 have shown that changes in the respi- ratory rate correlate significantly with changes in heart rate during exercise. Furthermore, the correlation is reported to hold in patients with restrictive or obstruc- tive airway disease.\u0000 The Biorate pacemakers (RDP3 and MB-i [Biotec, Bologna, Italy]) sense the respira- tory rate using an auxiliary electrode placed about 8 to 10 cm from the pacemaker casing(Fig i).

The MB-i pacemaker is a newer version of the RDP3 with programmable sensitivities and some telemetry functions. The Meta Pacemaker In the Meta pacemaker (Telectronics-Cordis, Engle- wood, CO), minute ventilation is estimated from changes in intracardiac impedance . This is achieved using a tripolar electrode configuration comprised of a standard bipolar electrode and the pacemaker cas- ing.\u0000 The source of electric current for impedance measurement consists of the ring electrode and pace- maker casing, and impedance is measured between the tip of the pacing electrode and the pacemaker casing (Fig i). Low-pass filtering to detect impedance changes below 60 Hz is used to reduce the influence of stroke volume on the impedance measurement. When programmed to the minute ventilation adaptive mode, the pacemaker registers minute ventilation throughout a prolonged period (over i h) to form a stable baseline minute ventilation against which a change during exercise is compared. A slope of rate response can then be programmed when the pace- maker is programmed in the rate-responsive mode (Table i). It is the aim of this study to assess the clinical benefits and chronotropic responses ofthese two forms of respiratory-sensing pacemakers. The evaluation in- cluded standard exercise tests and activities simulating ordinary daily life. Patients MATERIAL AND METHODS Ten patients with a mean age of 59 ± 2 years received Biorate pacemakers (seven, RDP3 and three, MB-i). All had complete heart block with atrial arrhythmias, and in eight of these patients the heart block was induced therapeutically with His bundle/atrioven- tricular nodal ablation. Two patients subsequently had their pace- makers explanted (one due to erosion of auxiliary lead and one due to symptomatic myopotential interference) and received Meta pacemakers. Meta pacemakers were implanted in ii patients. Their mean age was 59 ± 4 years. Ten had complete heart block with atrial arryth- mias; in four, this was induced by His bundle/atrioventricular node ablation and in two, this occurred after cardiac surgery One patient had sinoatrial disease. In both groups ofpatients, the electrode was implanted in the right ventricle. Single-chamber rate-responsive pacing was considered in these patients in preference to dual-chamber pacing because of associated atrial arrhythmias. No patient had clinical evidence of pulmonary disease. All had normal lung fields on chest radiographs. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Pacemaker Programming In both groups of patients, the pacemaker was programmed to achieve a pacing rate of about 100 beats per minute at the end of stage 1 of the Bruce protocol. The lower rate was set at 65 to 75 © 1989 American College of Chest Physicians by guest on July 10, 2011chestjournal.chestpubs.orgDownloaded from (I, 0 E 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 BIORATE META n =7 p<O.05 Cl) 0 E I- 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 WI AR BIORATE r - 0.81 U 150 -.% 130 E 0. .0 0 .\u0000 \u0000 110 0) C 0 90 U UU ‘S.

At one month after pacemaker implantation, two maximal exercise tests, performed in the constant rate (WI) mode and the rate-responsive mode, were done using the Bruce protocol in random order. The tests were separated by at least 2 h. A technician determined the randomization and monitored the electrocardiogram, and the blood pressure was monitored by a research nurse. The physician supervisingthe test encouraged the patient to maximum exercise. He also reoeivel information about the patients’ blood pressure and any arrhythmias during exercise and determined tl\u0000e endpoint ofthe test. \u0000oth he and the patient were not informed ofthe pacing mode. The exercise duration in each pacing mode was measured. In addition, the oxygen consumption at each minute of exercise was estimated (using the sex and weight of each patient) according to the published results by Bruce et al.’\u0000 Three patients with the Biorate pacemaker were excluded from this test for administra- five reasons (two patients) and erosion ofthe auxiliary lead (one patient). 1\\\u0000ro patients with the Mets pacemaker also were excluded because maximum exercise was limited by osteoar- thritis (one patient) and angina pectoris (one patient). 2.

While holding the breath, the arm on the side ofthe pacemaker was swung at 10 to 60 (at 10 times per minute increment) times per minute. The rate of swinging was governed by a metronome. The pacing rate achieved at the end of 45 s was recorded. 5. Myopotential interference was assessed by pressing the palms together. 6. Ambulatory recordings were performed in all patients in the rate-responsive mode using a Reynolds Tracker (Reynolds Medical Limited, Sunnyvale, CA). Bate responses observed were compared with the activities ofthe patient recorded with a detailed diary. Statistics Stud#{128}nt\u0000spaired t tests were used to compare exercise durations and pacing rates where appropriate. Two-way analysis of variance was applied to the pacing rates attained during arm swinging at different frequencies. Correlations were performed between the pacing rate and the estimated oxygen consumption and probability values assessed from standard tables. Results were expressed as mean ± standard error ofmean. A probability value ofless than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Symptom-Limited Treadmill Exercise The exercise durations during maximal treadmill exercise tests are summarized in Figure 2. In all patients, exercise was terminated because of breath- lessness or fatigue. Significant improvement in exer- cise duration was achieved in both groups of patients. In patients with Biorate, the improvement was from 346 ± 43 5 (VVI mode) to 448 ± 44 s (rate-responsive mode) (p<O.Oi; 29 percent improvement). In pa- tients with Meta, an improvement from 440 ± 4i s to 58i ± 6i 5 was achieved (p<0.OOi; 32 percent improve- ment). When the estimated oxygen consumption at each minute of the treadmill exercise was compared with the pacing rate, significant correlations between the pacing rate and oxygen consumption were noted (Fig 3). The correlations were O.8i (p<0.OOi) for the Biorate and 0.83 (p<0.OOi) for the Meta. The rate responses during brief treadmill exercise at different speeds and gradients are shown in Figure 4. In both groups ofpatients, the pacing rates increased as the patients walked at faster speeds or higher gradients. Maximum pacing rates were reached during all these activities within 2 mm from the onset of exercise . Ascending and descending stairs also resulted in proportional rate response (Table 2), although the maximum pacing rate was only reached after these Pacing rate (bpm) 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 1.2 mph FIGURE 4. Pacing rates achieved during brief walking activities. Although the magnitude of response differed between the two pacemakers during a similar activity, the direction of rate response was appropriate to the change in workload. briefactivities. For ascending stairs, the time delay for the Biorate and Meta pacemakers was 44 ± i6 s and 68 ± 9 5, respectively, and the delay was 20 ± i5 s and 8 ± 4 5 respectively when descending the stairs. The time delay was not statistically different between these two pacemakers. Effects of Respiratory Interference and Arm Movement Hyperventilation and coughing increased the pacing rates of both pacemakers (Table 2). There was no significant effect from speech in patients with the Biorate pacemaker (Table 2). On the other hand, the pacing rate response to the same exercise was signifi- cantly reduced during speech in the Meta pacemaker (Table 2). An increase in pacing rate proportional to the frequency of arm swinging was seen in patients with the Biorate. In patients with the Meta, a maximal pacing rate response occurred with the arm swinging at 30 cycles per minute. © 1989 American College of Chest Physicians by guest on July 10, 2011chestjournal.chestpubs.orgDownloaded from \u0000ir:\u0000 \u0000#{149}:\u0000 I 356 Single-chamber Cardiac Pacing (Lau, Ward, Camm) Table 2-Rate Responses During Stair Climbing and Effect ofVoluntary Interference on Pacing Rates of Biorate and Meta Pacemaker* Activity Biorate Meta Stair climbing Ascending 100 ± 6 104 ± 7 Descending 89±5 p<zO.05 77±2 p<O.Ol Hyperventilation 110±4 111± 10 Coughing 4±4 90±5 Exercise (2.5 miles per hour, i5%) Performedin 122±9 139±6 silence Performed while 125±6 NS 96±7 p<0.OOl talking Arm swinging (times per minute) 10 72±2 71±1 20 80±7 86±6 30 88±13 p<O.Ol 103±12 p<O.Ol 40 100±12 99±13 50 104±13 87±11 60 113±15 76±4 *Pacing rates expressed in beats per minute. Effects of Myopotential Interference All patients with RDP3 manifested myopotential interference of >5 s when the palms were pressed together. At nominal settings, no patient with MBI or Meta had myopotential interference. Holter Recording Rate responses were found to be related to the levels of activity. No episode of inappropriate rate acceleration was encountered in either group of pa- tients. Complications Observed on Follow-up Erosion ofthe auxiliary lead occurred in two patients with the Biorate pacemakers, one immediately after FIGURE 5. Erosion ofauxiliary lead in a patient with RDP3. implantation and the other after one year (Fig 5). Symptomatic myopotential interference was found in three patients. Since the RDP3 pacemaker had no programmable sensitivity, an operative approach was used. Attempts to use an insulation boot over the pacemaker did not prevent myopotential interference. All were replaced with bipolar pacemakers. Complications observed with Meta were related to implantation. In two patients, a hematoma developed at the site of implantation but subsided spontaneously. In one patient, lead dislodgement after implantation required repositioning. DIscUssIoN This study demonstrates that improvement in ex- ercise capacity can be achieved with respiration- sensing rate-responsive pacing. Both respiratory rate sensing and minute ventilation sensing resulted in pacing rates which correlated significantly with the estimated oxygen consumption. Although oxygen con- sumption was estimated rather than directly meas- ured, it served as a useful index ofthe level of exertion. In the patient with angina, the effect of rate response on the anginal threshold was not investigated in this study. However, previous studies 26,27 on patients with dual chamber pacemakers have documented that rate response in the dual-chamber pacing mode during exercise did not increase the severity of angina com- pared with exercise in the VVI mode. In the two patients in whom Meta pacemaker was used as a replacement unit, there was an improvement in exercise capacity when symptom-limited exercise was performed with the Meta pacemaker (Table 3). Both patients had used the Biorate pacemaker for one year prior to developing problems.

A training effect could not be excluded, although the tests had been separated by one year and the patients had been familiarized with the treadmill prior to formal testing. Long-term improvement in physical capacity by chronic rate-responsive pacing could be the factor responsible. Few patients perform continuous treadmill exercise in everyday life. During brief activities (walking and stair climbing), the direction of rate response was found to be appropriate to the work load. The magni- bide of rate responses to these activities between the two groups was not directly compared since this could be affected by different programmed settings and the pacemaker algorithm employed in these pacemakers. In both groups of patients, a significant delay in the onset ofrate response was noted during brief activities such as climbing stairs. Theoretically, at the onset of exercise, an immediate increase in ventilation occurs which is thought to be neurally mediated.m The extent of this ventilatory change is not related to the level of exercise. At the pacemaker settings used, a significant delay in rate responses occurred during brief activities. This may occur because pulmonary changes were too small to be detected or related to an in-built delay in the onset of rate response to a sensed respiratory signal. There was a trend for a faster rate response in the Biorate pacemaker, presumably because ofa higher propensity ofthis pacemaker to sense activity, as noted later on. However, in both pacemakers, the delay in rate response was unlikely to be a major limitation because the maximum pacing rate was usually reached within 2 mm from the onset of an exercise. Respiration is affected by requirements which may have no relationship to cardiac output. Thus, hyper- ventilation and coughing erroneously increased the pacing rate of both pacemakers. These, however, reflected usual situations and excessive rate accelera- tion was not encountered. Attenuation ofrate response during speech was seen in patients with the Meta pacemaker. This may be related to a higher propensity of the Biorate pacemaker to sense activity which is not affected by speech. Arm swinging is an accompaniment of many activi- ties, such as walking. Both pacemakers responded to arm swinging during apnea. We\u0000 and others\u0000#{176}have observed that arm swinging can alter the rate response of the Biorate pacemaker, presumably due to move- ment artefact-induced impedance changes.3’ The bi- polar electrode configuration used in the Biorate pacemaker to measure impedance was particularly prone to this interference. In addition, the rate response was related to the frequency ofarm swinging (which was interpreted as a respiratory rate). Modu- lation ofthe rate response of the Meta pacemaker also can occur during arm swinging. However, in this pacemaker, the use ofa tripolar electrode configuration and the presence of a low-band pass filter (set at 60 Hz) have reduced this form of interference . As each arm swing causes the pacemaker to be displaced twice in its pocket, arm swinging faster than 30 times per minute will not be sensed by this pacemaker because of this filter. One would expect arm swinging would lead to an increase in heart rate in normal individuals under similar conditions and this form of activity sensing was probably advantageous in improving the speed and magnitude of rate response. The ability to sense motion differed among the patients, since this was related to the susceptibility of the pacemaker to be displaced by arm movement. Heart rate during exercise has been reported to correlate better with minute ventilation than respira- tory rate.\u0000”32’\u0000 This is mainly due to the relatively slow change of respiratory rate at low levels of activity, when minute ventilation is mainly determined by a change in tidal volume. However, the levels of corre- lation between the pacing rate and estimated oxygen consumption achieved in this study were similar (0.8i with Biorate compared with 0.83 with Meta). This may be attributed to the more pronounced activity- sensing property of the Biorate pacemaker which improved its rate response at low levels of activity. Although both forms of respiratory sensing are feasible principles for definition of the pacing rate during exercise, the relative reliability and safety of these pacemakers need to be mentioned. Technical problems have limited the earlier version (RDP3) of the Biorate pacemaker. In this pacemaker there was no programmable sensitivity, and myopotential inter- ference was a major problem encountered in this study. It is of interest to note that although arm swinging movement can lead to a rate response of this pacemaker, isometric arm exercise reduces its pacing rate because of myopotential interference. Biopolar sensing in the Meta pacemaker has reduced the problem of myopotential interference. The use of an auxiliary lead for respiratory sensing in the Biorate pacemaker can be problematic. Al- though the implantation ofthis lead is not complicated, there is the potential problem oflead erosion in some patients, and intrathoracic impedance in the Meta is a clear advantage. CONCLUSION It is concluded that the two respiratory sensing pacemakers confer hemodynamic benefits to patients with bradycardias. Both pacing algorithms showed good correlations with estimated oxygen consumption, © 1989 American College of Chest Physicians by guest on July 10, 2011chestjournal.chestpubs.orgDownloaded from 358 Single-chamber Cardiac Pacing (Lau, \u0000rd, Camm) and the rate responses are appropriate to ordinary daily activities. Both pacemakers have the potential for activity sensing which improves their rate response, although this is more obvious with the Biorate pace- maker. Myopotential interference is a significant prob- lem with the RDP3, and the requirement of an auxiliary lead can be problematic in some patients. REFERENCES 1 Sutton R. Physiological cardiac pacing.
