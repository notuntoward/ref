Abortion used to be avoting issue for Americans who favored reproductive rights andones who opposed abortion; had that changed?In our latest Times Opinion focus group, we explored thesequestions with 14 Trump voters — mostly Republicans andindependents who shared these views — and also asked them tolook forward: What do they want Mr. Trump to do in ofﬁce? Whatdo they want him to avoid? What kind of mandate does he have inthe eyes of these supporters, who arenʼt MAGA die-hards?Many of these 14 voters saw his victory as a sign that America is “alittle more uniﬁed than we thought we were,” in the words of Jason,a 38-year-old independent from Florida.

Most felt he had a mandate to deportundocumented immigrants who were violent or had committedcrimes — though they were more divided over deporting law-abiding immigrants.When it came to Mr. Trumpʼs being extreme, the participantsgenerally used that word about his language and leadership style,and most of them liked that he threw around threats against foreignadversaries or took a hard line on issues like illegal immigration. Asfor abortion, it simply was not a vote driver: Our group thought Mr.Trump was probably more conservative on the issue than they were,but they also saw him as not having a role now that itʼs up to thestates.The idea of America moving on from politics and being more unitedthan it seems was a core idea for many in the group. They said theywere tired of being criticized for holding conservative or contraryopinions and thought a lot of other Americans were, too. What mayunite us in the end? “Eventually, everybodyʼs going to get tired ofnitpicking,” said Julie, a 65-year-old Republican from Maryland.Patrick Healy, Margie Omero and Adrian J.

These days, it seems you share anopinion and two or three people in the crowd wantto go crazy. A lot of us have lost our patriotism. Inthe days of the baby boomers, there was a lot of funand excitement, even though we had the wars andeverything we had to go through. We had goodjobs.

It just seemed like just a much better worldto live in.Moderator, Margie OmeroChris, tell me why you think America’s best days areahead of us.Chris, 46, white, Pennsylvania, line technicianI think it more comes from a hope. Right now,people have a hard time having normal, civilconversations about things.

I said, “Murray, why would youvote for this person?” He said, “He’s kind of a joke.”But seeing what he did in his term and seeing whathe’s saying now, he’s definitely more qualified thanI thought he was.Kathi, 57, white, Ohio, property managementHis mouth gets a little bit too much, but I thoughthe was a little bit more polished in this election,which I appreciated.Direnda, 66, white, Kentucky, house cleanerI thought he was so arrogant, but now, I think weneed someone a little arrogant. We need somebodylike that to straighten up the world. I just hope hedoesn’t tweet anymore.Moderator, Margie OmeroTell me why you voted for Trump.Nicholas, 20, white, New York, driverI voted for Donald Trump because I like the waythat he was with other leaders. He wasn’t just like,“Oh, yeah, let’s be friends.” He threatened them,and he had to because they were killing oureconomy.Kenneth, 62, Black, California, truck driverI served in the military.

You seethe difference in what he was able to accomplish inhis four years, as opposed to what happened thesepast four. He runs this country like a business. Andto some extent, that’s what you have to do, becausethe more money that we make, the more it’s goingto benefit us. I think it’s tough for some people tosee that, because of the brash side of him.Seneca, 28, white, Arizona, charge specialistI voted for him because I thought he was reallysmart and really good with money. And then alsohealth care. I think it’s really cool that he’s going totake on fighting the big health care corporationsthat are charging insane amounts and hopefully getthat under control.Moderator, Patrick HealyI want to talk a little bit about how you would describeTrump’s vision for America’s future. If he had his way,what would things be like in America four years fromnow?Jason, 38, white, Florida, realtorHe had a booming economy in his first term, and Ican only assume he’s going to do the same thingthe second time around, especially with trying tobring a lot of our foreign jobs back over here.

But we don’ttalk about the people that are allowed to walkacross, legally, into the United States. They comehere. They get so many benefits.

I’m retired. I can’t do it, but there arepeople down here that do those types of things.Chris, 46, white, Pennsylvania, line technicianI think that there’s probably a very good majorityof people that are undocumented that are normal,law-abiding people and could be contributingmembers of society. So I don’t think that getting ridof all of those is necessarily the answer. There aresome that obviously don’t deserve to be here, but tojust get rid of all of them — there’s people that areborn here every day that — would they have to gostart a new life in some other country, through nofault of their own? There could be some common-sense ways to go about doing it, other than justpicking up and shipping them all out.Mary, 50, Asian, Wyoming, assistantI think I agree with Chris.

Be professional,but I don’t want you to be a pushover.Ashley, 31, white, Missouri, customer serviceI think an extreme thing that he could potentiallydo is banning gender-affirming care for adults.Leave the children out of it, but there’s no reason toprevent adult Americans from living their lives howthey want to live their life.Seneca, 28, white, Arizona, charge specialistI think he needs to be a little extreme to be a leader,and a lot of times, there’s going to be people whodon’t agree with him, and that’s just how things are.Moderator, Margie OmeroLet’s talk a bit about abortion. 12/12/24, 4:57 PM Opinion | Trump’s Second Term: 14 Trump Voters Discuss - The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/10/opinion/trump-voters-second-term-focus-group.html?campaign_id=39&emc=edit_ty_20241212&inst… 19/33Moderator, Margie OmeroKenneth, you didn’t raise your hand.Kenneth, 62, Black, California, truck driverMy opinion on abortion is that it’s a woman’s body.I don’t think politicians should be in a position totell a person what they should do with their body.

He doesn’t have a sayanymore.Erich, 23, white, New Jersey, lacrosse coachOn abortion, I fell in the middle, leaning towardTrump, where I do agree on leaving it up to thestates. But it is a woman’s body. It is her choice asto what happens with that, but there should besome regulation to late-term abortions and stuff.Direnda, 66, white, Kentucky, house cleanerYeah, I’m kind of in the middle. People are trying tomake laws on what people do with their bodies, butit really depends upon the situation. You’ve gotrape victims, people who are traumatized, peoplewho are deathly ill.

He just washedhis hands of the whole situation and said: OK, youguys decide.Seneca, 28, white, Arizona, charge specialistI think Trump wanted to give the abortion rights tothe state, and in my state, we just had a vote on it,where an abortion would be legal up to 24 weeks,six months of being pregnant. I think there’scertain situations when a woman should get anabortion and they should have an option to do it,but I think 12 weeks, unless it’s a certain situation— rape, incest, medically necessary for the motheror the baby — should be the limit. I like that it’sback on the states.Moderator, Margie OmeroDuring recruitment for this group, everyone here saidthat they support abortion rights being legal. Trump hastaken credit for overturning Roe v. Wade, and sincethen, abortion has been banned in some states aroundthe country. Trump has also said that he doesn’t supporta national abortion ban.

He’s also raisedquestions about scientific studies and about vaccines.Do you have strong feelings about Kennedy?Jason, 38, white, Florida, realtorI’m glad he got picked.

How muchshould they be doing what the president wants thoseagencies to do? Or should they be independent of thepresident?Joseph, 55, white, Minnesota, handymanYou have to have people that are able to follow thelaws of America, the Constitution, and not havesomebody that wants to bend the rules and enforcewhatever their mind-set might be at the time.You’ve got to also remember his age.
