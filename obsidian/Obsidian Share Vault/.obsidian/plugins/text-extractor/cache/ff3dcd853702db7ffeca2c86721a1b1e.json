While the climate of the UK might be moving to warmer and wetter winters, and hotter and drier summers, this could lead to signiﬁcant changes in the shape of the demand proﬁle. Some notable extreme weather events have occurred in the past, e.g. unusually hot summer tem- peratures in 1995 and 2003 that created a surge in regional electricity demand when compared with the long-term av- erage. Such events can pose a challenge to energy forecast- ers who must provide accurate predictions to utility decision makers. This paper thus outlines the use of generalized ex- treme value (GEV) theory and block maxima approach to estimate the maximum load forecast errors (residuals) up to several decades ahead to assess risk in long-term electricity demand projection when climate change effects become im- portant. The maximum residuals are expressed in terms of return level and return period that would occur within a ﬁ- nite time series corresponding to accepted levels of risk so that appropriate risk measures can be taken. The maximum residual is then added to the predicted demand to give the expected demand with a given level of risk. Keywords - climate change, daily residuals, general- ized extreme value (GEV), return level, return period. 1 Introduction A NNUAL peaks in electricity demand in the UK are already well known as the consequence of cold win- ter weather. This will certainly continue to be the case, but over the last 10 years, air conditioning and refrigera- tion electricity demand have caused signiﬁcant impacts on the demand proﬁle particularly in hot summers [1]. This new demand is set to increase with an expected rise in an- nual mean temperatures driven by the changing climate. In addition, electricity consumption in England and Wales is increasing at the rate of around 1.6% per year. This will certainly have greater implications on the running of the transmission system in terms of matching generation and demands. In the post-deregulated energy market, utili- ties are increasingly running the transmission and distribu- tion lines closer to their capacity as regulatory constraints have restricted investment in new cables [2]. As such, fre- quent excessive demand may constantly put the security of electricity supply at risk. Unlike other load forecasting techniques, our prime concern is to model the probability of the unusual high electricity demand caused by extreme events that cannot be explained by some existing forecast models. These extreme events can be weather- and/or non- weather related. Many load forecast models like regres- sion [3] may be able to foretell the trend of the electricity demand pattern reliably but, the technique often ignores the outliers which in turn become less sensitive to abrupt changes and more vulnerable to extremes. It is very es- sential for the energy utilities to know if there are any rare phenomenon that cannot be explained by their load fore- cast model and assuming that such extreme would reap- pear again in future, how high the electricity demand will go and how wrong the existing model can be? Such infor- mation is absolutely crucial not only for utility planning but also helpful for assets optimization, reliability assess- ment and risk management. 2 Residual Demand Analysis A volatile time series is usually deﬁned as one that exhibits many extreme changes. As changes in electricity de- mand are often cyclical in nature and not generally volatile when aggregated on a national scale, we focus on the more volatile residual demand or return time series. Pre- viously, we have developed an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARIMA) time series model with exogenous cli- matic variables and a socio-economic trend incorporating Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic- ity (GARCH) [4] to predict long-term future daily electric- ity demand using climatic variables produced by a weather generator downscaled from the output of a Global Circu- lation Model (GCM) [5]. Forecasts were compared with actual load data to produce a residual time series. This was then used in conjunction with a GARCH model to estimate the maximum electricity demand with respect to a given level of risk projecting forward a number of years into the future. It is important to clarify that the residual demand is the forecast error that represents the portion of the de- mand that has not been captured or explicitly explained by our ARIMA forecast model 1. As it is extremely difﬁcult to distinguish the effects of the weather and non-weather variables from the load demand, our analysis is therefore based on the daily residual patterns since the volatility of weather has a more obvious impact on a daily basis rather than on an hourly, weekly or monthly basis (e.g. temper- ature does not usually change signiﬁcantly over a day). Assuming that these daily non-weather effects (weekend, holidays effects, consumer behaviour towards energy sav- ings) will remain unchanged in the near future, we can then associate the load projection more closely with the changing climate using the four future climate change sce- narios deﬁned by United Kingdom Climate Impacts Pro- gramme (UKCIP). The increase in long term electricity demand is also largely due to the economic and popula- tion growth. In order to provide a more realistic picture of how the load would change in a much longer horizon, we introduce several future socio-economic scenarios into our daily load projection. These scenarios have been de- veloped by Building Economic and Social information for Examining the Effects of Climate cHange (BESEECH) to characterise both the various drivers of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change, and the sensitivity and vulnerability of social and eco- nomic systems. The work serves as an initial step to in- vestigate the impacts of climate change on an electricity supply industry and its networks [6]. The return series in most load forecast models is gen- erally modeled using a Gaussian distribution. As an alter- native to this, we used a Student t distribution which has a thicker tail and may be more appropriate for modeling extreme values. However, this type of distribution often overestimates the number of extreme events which can be seen in the tails of the cumulative probability plot as seen in Figure 1. −2 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 x 10 5 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 0.25 0.5 0.75 0.9 0.99 0.999 0.9999 Residual Demand (MWh/day)Cumulative Probability Residual Normal Student Figure 1: Cumulative probability (Student t and normal distributions). A more appropriate way of modeling the extreme tails of the residual distribution is required for assessing levels of risk in electricity demand forecasting. To do this, we have chosen to use extreme value theory which has been applied successfully in the ﬁelds of hydrology [7] and ﬁ- nancial time series forecasting [8]. Our interest lies in the risk of under-demand prediction, i.e. positive residuals, that could severely affect the operation of the electrical systems particularly during extreme weather events. The scope of our analysis can also cover over-demand predic- tion but for brevity, we have not detailed this. 3 Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) Theory Extreme value theory (EVT) is a robust framework for modeling the extreme tails of a distribution [8]. The prin- cipal use of EVT is to quantify the stochastic behavior of a process at unusually large or small levels. More specif- ically, EVT generally allows estimation of the probabil- ity of events that are more extreme than any that have been previously observed [9]. Unlike the risk assessment method proposed in [10], our interest here is to estimate the return levels and the return period of the `extreme' residuals from our load forecast. These estimated maxi- mum residuals can then be added to the forecasted daily load to yield the expected maximum demand with various levels of risk. The aim of this work described is intended for long-term (over decades) electricity demand forecast- ing where climate change effects may become signiﬁcant. In this paper, we demonstrate how to ﬁt the resid- ual demand using a single GEV distribution that includes three types of extreme value distribution, and investigate likelihood-based conﬁdence intervals of the ﬁtted distribu- tion. The three extreme value distributions that are often used in this context are known as: Type I (Gumbel), II (Fr´echet) and III (Weibull). Each type corresponds to a limiting distribution of block maxima drawn from differ- ent classes of underlying distributions. Distributions with tails that exhibit an exponential decrease, such as the nor- mal distribution, lead to Type I whereas distributions that display tails which decrease polynomially, such as Stu- dent t distribution, lead to Type II. Finally, distributions with ﬁnite tails, such as the beta distribution, lead to Type III [11]. Type II and Type III distributions attain the shape of Type I when the tail index parameter α goes to ∞ and −∞ respectively. Assume that the daily residual demand series is iden- tically independent distributed (i.i.d) with random vari- ables X1, X2, . . . , Xn representing risks with a common unknown distribution; F (x) = P r {Xn ≤ x}, this sam- ple of size m is then divided into b large blocks of equal size, where m = bn. The maximum of the n observa- tions in block i is deﬁned as {Mn = max (X1, . . . , Xn)}i in which n ≥ 2. We thus ﬁt the GEV to the block maxima data {Mn}i , i = 1, . . . , b to extract upper extreme values from a set of these data. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Mn (x) is P r {Mn ≤ x} = P r {X1 ≤ x, . . . , Xn ≤ x} = n∏ i=1 F (x) = F n (x). These maxima are then normalized (standardized) to ﬁt our speciﬁc dis- tribution as Zn = (Xn − µn) /σn where µn and σn > 0 are constant location (scalar) and scale (tendency) parameters. For large enough n, P r {Zn < z} = P r {((Mn − µn) /σn) < z} ≈ Hξ (z) and P r {Mn < x} ≈ Hξ,µ,σ ((Mn − µn) /σn) = Hξ,µn,σn (x) for x = σnz + µn where H indicates the extreme value distributions. We thus have: Hξ (z) = Hξ ((x − µ) /σ) = Hξ,µ,σ (x). By taking the re- parameterization α = 1/ξ (ξ: shape parameter) and in- 16th PSCC, Glasgow, Scotland, July 14-18, 2008 Page 2 troducing µ and σ > 0 parameters respectively, Fr´echet, Weibull and Gumbel distributions, H can be expressed in a uniﬁed GEV model with a one-parameter representa- tion [8]: Hξ,µ,σ (x) = exp − [ 1 + ξ ( x − µ To compute conﬁdence interval estimates, it is useful to approach the quantile estimation problem by directly re- parameterizing the GEV distribution as a function of the unknown return level Rk n. To achieve this, we isolate µ from Equation (8) and (9) and substitute it into Hξ,σ,µ (x) deﬁned in Equation (1) and (2) respectively [13].

This implies extrapolation of the GEV ﬁt to a domain outside the range of the observations. In our approach, the return value determination involves long- range extrapolation (k = 100 years since the UKCIP cli- mate change scenarios data available for our study is up to 2080s). The series length and return periods of inter- est k are signiﬁcantly different and thus, this considerably increases the uncertainty in the estimate. A likelihood based method is used to compute conﬁ- dence limits. Given any set of values for the parameters µ, σ, and ξ, we can compute a log-likelihood by MLEs; the parameter values that maximizes the GEV log-likelihood. As the parameter values move away from the MLEs, their log-likelihood becomes signiﬁcantly less than the maxi- mum. The set of parameter values that produce a log- likelihood larger than a speciﬁed critical value forms a complicated region in the parameter space. For a suitable critical value however, it forms a conﬁdence region that contains the parameter values which are compatible with the data. The critical value that determines the region is based on a chi-square approximation [11]. Figure 6 shows that the k-block return level corre- sponds to the 95% conﬁdence intervals computed using the proﬁle likelihood function for various return periods. The proﬁle log-likelihood function for the 10-year re- turn level is reasonably symmetric about its central value whereas the proﬁle log-likelihood functions for the 50 and 100 year return levels are much more skewed than 10 and 20-year return levels. The skewness of the proﬁle log-likelihood function reﬂects greater uncertainty about higher return levels, where there is less information that can be extracted from the `historic' data when projecting further into the future [15]. To ensure that we are not in- troducing extreme events that are the result of seasonal effects, we focus our attention on the annual block max- ima. For example, by setting the annual return period, k = 10, the estimated 10 year return level ˆR10 y is 111,295 MWh/day, meaning that the maximum forecast error (re- turn) likely to be observed once during a period of 10 years would be 111,295 MWh/day. 200 400 600 800 1000 0.5 1 1.5 x 10 5 Monthly Return Period Return Level (MWh/day) 100 200 300 0.5 1 1.5 x 10 5 Seasonal Return PeriodReturn Level (MWh/day) 50 100 150 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Semester Return PeriodReturn Level (MWh/day) 20 40 60 80 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 5 Annual Return PeriodReturn Level (MWh/day) Figure 6: Return period versus return levels. Using the annual maxima model, the maximum likeli- hood estimate of the 20-year return level, ˆR20 365 is 123,698 MWh/day (see Table 2) and its 95% conﬁdence interval is (108,097, 166,293). Point estimates of the 20-seasonal and 20-semester return levels; ˆR20 91 and ˆR20 183 are 96,627 MWh/day and 110,339 MWh/day respectively. For clar- ity, these values are highlighted in bold in Table 2. Clearly, if the model for maxima in different blocks are consistent then the 20-year return level should correspond roughly with the 40-semester, 80-seasonal and 240 monthly return levels. From Table 2, this appears to be the case when considering ˆR20 365, ˆR40 183 ( = ˆR20 (y,183)) , ˆR80 91 (= ˆR20 (y,91)) and ˆR240 30 (= ˆR20 (y,30)). These are highlighted in bold in the row marked ˆR20 (y,n) where y = year, n = 30 for monthly model, n = 91 for seasonal (3 months) model and n = 183 for semester (6 months) model. As there is a degree of correlation in the return series, there may be some errors in the estimates due to the assumption that the values in the series are independent when estimating the GEV pa- rameters. The point estimates should be reasonable but the standard errors may be too small. It can be seen that there is a rising trend in Table 2 from monthly to annual return level which could be caused by correlation in the residual series. However, the annual return level itself is not too different from the semester level. 16th PSCC, Glasgow, Scotland, July 14-18, 2008 Page 5 riod, when, once again, social factors could not be ac- counted accurately by our ARIMA model. Despite this, the results show that the estimated number of exceedances are still closely in line with our expectation. This indi- cates that the unconditional GEV model we proposed here is capable of estimating the appropriate return level to as- sess the risk in load forecast uncertainty.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
