For the hot news, check out our News from the Usual Suspects © section below, where we offer the best external coverage of the matter. Now , let's talk about Mamba – a new architecture that rivals the famous T ransformer- based models. Mamba's innovations address significant challenges in processing long sequences, a problem that has limited traditional models. So what is it? Mamba leverages state-space models (SSMs)*, particularly excelling with its incorporation of Structured State Space (S4) models into a large language model (LLM) framework. This integration allows Mamba to achieve linear complexity scaling with sequence length, marking a significant advancement over the quadratic scaling seen in traditional T ransformer-based models. Its streamlined architecture incorporates selective SSM layers, enhancing both ef ficiency and flexibility . As a result, Mamba efficiently processes extremely long sequences, surpassing earlier models in performance. Additionally , it benefits from hardware-aware optimizations, maximizing the potential of contemporary GPU architectures. This means you can process much longer sequences without hitting memory or compute bottlenecks. Think about applications like genomic analysis, long-form content generation, and complex multi-modal data processing, all becoming more feasible with Mamba's power . *State-space models are mathematical frameworks that describe a system's dynamics in terms of its state variables and observations, capturing the evolution and uncertainty of processes over time. SSMs are known for efficiency with long sequences. 3 /2 5 /2 4 , 7 :4 6 P M W h a t is M a m b a a n d c a n it b e a t T r a n s fo r m e r s ? h ttp s ://w w w .tu r in g p o s t.c o m /p /fo d 4 6 3 /1 5 Mamba's ability to ef ficiently process long sequences while maintaining competitive performance has fueled research interest in adapting and extending the architecture for various domains. It seems, Mamba’ s architecture is getting more attention (Attention is all you need ;) – last week, three papers showcased exciting developments. The paper , EfficientVMamba: Atrous Selective Scan for Light W eight V isual Mamba , makes Mamba more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices by introducing an ef ficient 2D scanning method and a dual-pathway module for balanced global-local feature extraction. Results show significant reduction in FLOPs while maintaining strong accuracy . The paper , Cobra: Extending Mamba to Multi-Modal Large Language Model for Efficient Inference , extends Mamba to be a multi-modal large language model capable of jointly reasoning over vision and language. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance on vision-language tasks with faster inference speeds compared to T ransformer-based models. The paper , SiMBA: Simplified Mamba-based Architecture for V ision and Multivariate T ime series , presents a simplified Mamba-based architecture that addresses stability issues when scaling Mamba to larger sizes. The key innovation is EinFFT , a novel channel mixing technique that ensures stable optimization. SiMBA shows strong results on vision tasks and multivariate time series forecasting, closing the gap with state-of-the-art T ransformers. These three papers highlight the architectural flexibility and potential of the Mamba model, which is promising for future advancements in context window size and data type support. If you want to move beyond T ransformers, that might be the way to go.

Eric Newcomer points out at Microsoft’ s creativity in non-acquisition strategies, such as partnering with and investing in companies like Inflection and OpenAI without formal acquisitions, sidestepping antitrust reviews. The Stratechery explains why many aspects of Inflection and its rapid ascent to Unicorn status were odd from the very beginning. Soma Somasegar from Madrona VC thinks that Microsoft partners with Inflection.ai to innovate in AI for consumers, aiming to transform its presence in the consumer market.
