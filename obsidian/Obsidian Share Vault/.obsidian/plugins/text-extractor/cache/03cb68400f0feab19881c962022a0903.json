Split $1.7BSplit $1.2B A majority say they would support a measure renewing and expanding Seattle’s transportation levy at both amounts tested, although around half of the support is in the softer “somewhat” category. Support for $1.2B is close to two-thirds. This measure concerns replacing funding for citywide transportation maintenance and improvements. If approved, it would renew and expand an expiring transportation levy. Funding from this measure would help maintain and modernize our streets and bridges; improve safety for drivers and pedestrians; and reduce our impact on the environment. It authorizes a regular property tax increase within legal limits, allowing maximum new collections of (SPLIT A: $135 million in 2025 and $1.2 billion SPLIT B: $200 million in 2025 and $1.7 billion) over eight years. The 2025 total regular tax limit would be (SPLIT A: $0.43/$1,000 SPLIT B: $0.64/$1,000) of assessed value, including approximately (SPLIT A: $0.08/$1,000 SPLIT B: $0.29/$1,000) of assessed value in additional taxes. 23-9032 SDOT Transportation Levy Survey DRAFT| 13 77% 71% 71% 67% 67% 66% 66% 64% 64% 64% 62% 60% 58% 58% 46% 22% 28% 28% 33% 33% 33% 33% 35% 35% 36% 37% 40% 41% 42% 54% +55 +44 +43 +34 +33 +33 +33 +29 +29 +27 +25 +20 +17 +15 -8 Transit/Walk/Bike/Rideshare/Other (29%) Renter/Other (45%) White (73%) Central (D3, D7) (27%) 65+ (21%) 18-49 (57%) Female (50%) Overall North (D4, D5, D6) (44%) Male (48%) South (D1, D2) (29%) Drive or carpool (70%) Homeowner (55%) 50-64 (22%) BIPOC (23%) Support (Don't know/Not sure) Oppose Initial Support by Subgroup - $1.2B Q7.

The first provided a total for the average homeowner. This information drops support for both levy amounts. The second clarified that this proposal is a renewal, and with this information support for both levy amounts recovers. Q9&Q10. Knowing this, would you strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose this measure? Because this measure is not a new tax, and only renews and expand the existing levy, the actual cost increase for the owner of an $866,000 home will be about (SPLIT $1.2B: $75 SPLIT $1.7B: $255) more a year, which is about (SPLIT $1.2B: $6 SPLIT $1.7B: $21) a month. This measure will cost the owner of an $866,000 home, which is the median in Seattle, about (SPLIT $1.2B: $370 SPLIT $1.7B: $555) a year which is about (SPLIT $1.2B: $30 SPLIT $1.7B: $45) a month.

Some people say we should focus on other important needs like helping the homeless and reducing crime, instead of spending more money on transportation. They say our cost of living is extremely high, and the City of Seattle hasn’t done a great job with the dollars we’re already paying them for transportation. They say that we should probably skip approving this measure right now and allow for housing, food, fuel and other costs to go down—and government efficiency to increase. 23-9032 SDOT Transportation Levy Survey DRAFT| 23 Full Progression Q7/9/10/46/47.

Transportation issues are not seen as important problems.  Close to half recognize the need for additional funding for transportation in Seattle, and a slim majority thinks SDOT is spending effectively.  The City’s transportation system receives positive ratings for a few items, and average for most others. Only rush hour traffic congestion receives a strongly negative rating.  Support for renewing and expanding Seattle’s expiring transportation levy is a small to solid majority at both levy amounts tested. • However, half of initial support is in the softer “somewhat” category for both packages • Support for $1.7 drops to 50% after voters hear its total cost to them.  Many of the most important components in a potential package deal with maintenance and repair. Also among the most important items are those relating to tree cover, improved safety, and car free travel.  Measure support drops after voters hear some reasons to reject it.
