What’s a word that describes how you feel thingsare going in America? “Optimistic.” Jon, 45, Pa., white, Repub. “Challenging.” Andy, 60, N.Y., white Repub. “In need of a change.” Brett, 62, Calif., Black, Dem. America has lost its way when it comes to men: the lessons they are taught asboys, the behavior expected of them at work and socially, the expectations of what being a man are. The return of Donald Trump as president might start setting things straight — that’s the hope, at least, among the 12 men in our latest Times Opinion focus group. They all voted for Mr. Trump in November not only becausethey liked his views on the economy, crime and immigration but also because many of them believe he’s “a man’s man” whose government leadership and approach toAmerican culture will help many men who feel devalued, overlooked, lost or isolated. “One of the reasons so many young men probably voted for Donald Trump is they're having trouble finding their way in our current society,” argued one of ourparticipants, Matthew, a 43-year-old from Tennessee. With Mr. Trump preparing to take office on Monday, we wanted to dig into why oneof his core constituencies — men who prefer Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, YouTube and X over the mainstream media — put so much trust in these sources of informationand believe that Mr. Trump, in particular, has their backs. We spoke with a mix of Republicans, Democrats and one independent of various ages, races and ethnicitiesand professions. Why do these men trust what they trust? Time and again, they said they were drawnto qualities like common sense, curiosity and freewheeling debate and to people with strong beliefs who are willing to go toe-to-toe with anyone. Listening to themen, you can see why Mark Zuckerberg, who recently appeared on Mr. Rogan’s podcast, shelved the fact-checking operation at Meta: They said their views wereshaped in part by conversation and debates on podcasts that could last hours and not from news and social media sources that provided fact-checking that the mendidn’t have faith in. The most robust debates in the group were about what constituted a “man’s man” — atheme that kept coming up — and why some men feel isolated or depressed in society today. For the most part, though, they were optimistic about the future under Mr.Trump and his allies. “I’ve been an Elon Musk fan since before probably most of you knew who Elon was,” said Jon, a 45-year-old from Pennsylvania. “And the factthat I have a chance to live in an America where Elon and Vivek Ramaswamy are charged with ridding the government of fraud, waste and abuse — that’s the AmericaI want to live in.” Patrick Healy, Kristen Soltis Anderson and Adrian J.

Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorney Helping get my three kids ready. Then work email. Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister I am a minister. I usually wake up at 4 a.m. My first half-hour is usually personal time, prayer, meditation, and then I start to engage with email andtexts. Ron W., 39, California, Black, independent, construction I wake up at 5 a.m., and I’ll work out for an hour. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Now I want to hear about the last hour of your day. Rich, 54, New York, Latino, Democrat, construction I get in bed, get on my laptop, answer some emails. Have the TV on in the background, watch some news and try to decompress from the day. Brett, 62, California, Black, Democrat, retired Almost every night, I have some ice cream, watch a little TV, take a shower and go to bed. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson I want to hear more about how you get news and information about important issues affecting the country. Ken, 39, western U.S., Pacific Islander, Democrat, teacher Online. I use MSN to filter and then look at other news outlets. I’ll listen to Joe Rogan’s podcast, but at the same time, I’ll listen to something else from another side. I try to be nonbiased, because it’s so easy to look at something in just one way, but that’s just half the story. Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business owner I get most of my info from X. That’s a constant stream of intel throughout the day. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Are there particular accounts that you follow on X? Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business owner Folks on the right, folks on the left, podcasters I enjoy. Obviously we all get bombarded with Elon Musk posts. If I am spending that last hour of the day with my wife, we’ll watch some of our favorite YouTube news feeds on our TV. The one we watch the most is Breaking Points . Ron W., 39, California, Black, independent, construction I’ll usually go online between CNN and Fox News and see what I think is right, what I think is wrong and what I agree or don’t agree with. Luis, 39, Florida, biracial, Democrat, unemployed I go to Reddit. Usually you can see both sides because somebody will point out the opposite side of whatever the issue is. Do you use Reddit at least once a week to get news? Do you use Reddit at least once a week to get news? 5 people raised their hands. Matthew, 43, Tenn., white, Repub. Ron W., 39, Calif., Black, indep.Ron G., 55, Ky., white, Repub.Rich, 54, N.Y., Latino, Dem.Michael, 52, Ill., white, Repub.Walter, 65, N.Y., white, Repub.Glen, 59, Fla., white, Repub.Brett, 62, Calif., Black, Dem.Ken, 39, western U.S., Pacific Islander, Dem.Luis, 39, Fla., biracial, Dem.Jon, 45, Pa., white, Repub.Andy, 60, N.Y., white Repub.Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister I use Newsmax a lot, but I also use Turning Point USA, CBN and i24news, which is Israel’s 24-hour news. It’s similar to Fox News. Glen, 59, Florida, white, Republican, community manager I watch very little TV news. It drives me insane. It just feels like there’s not a lot of positive to it. Moderator, Patrick Healy I wanted to learn more about what podcasts and hosts you guys trust the most — trust that keeps you coming back to listen more. Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorney Ben Shapiro. He’s quick on his feet. He’s an attorney by training. He goes to debate forums and colleges. He goes into the belly of the beast. He’s very analytical, has the facts, well researched. It just gives you an aura of credibility. Moderator, Patrick Healy What do you mean by going “into the belly of the beast”? Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorney I think a lot of left-wing groups will often protest when he goes to campuses to try to prevent him from speaking. He’s been on Jubilee , where it’s, like, 20 folks from the left debate one person on the right or vice versa. He’s not afraid to debate really anyone or anything in any place, and I like that. Ron G., 55, Kentucky, white, Republican, nurse Trust is very difficult because you get fed all kinds of information from all different sides, and unfortunately we’ve been fed a lot of wrong truths. Ilistened to Charlie Kirk a lot. My Christian beliefs are in tune with his, and I believe what he says. Rich, 54, New York, Latino, Democrat, construction I like Tucker Carlson. And I like Joe Rogan. I just feel they’re genuine, authentic, and they come across like they’re saying what they really feel and notputting their finger in the air and deciding where the political winds are going. I like who they interview. Moderator, Patrick Healy Is there an interview you liked that comes to mind? Rich, 54, New York, Latino, Democrat, construction Recently Tucker interviewed the Russian right-hand man of Putin, and I found it interesting. I’m open to his point of view. Do you consider podcasts one of the main ways that you get information about the world? Do you consider podcasts one of the main ways that you get information about the world? 10 people raised their hands. Matthew, 43, Tenn., white, Repub. Ron W., 39, Calif., Black, indep.Ron G., 55, Ky., white, Repub.Rich, 54, N.Y., Latino, Dem.Michael, 52, Ill., white, Repub.Walter, 65, N.Y., white, Repub.Glen, 59, Fla., white, Repub.Brett, 62, Calif., Black, Dem.Ken, 39, western U.S., Pacific Islander, Dem.Luis, 39, Fla., biracial, Dem.Jon, 45, Pa., white, Repub.Andy, 60, N.Y., white Repub. Moderator, Patrick Healy What builds trust in the people you listen to regularly? Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister I think a lot of it has to do with common sense. A lot of what’s in newspapers and the drive-by media, it’s just not common-sense facts there. It’s common sense whata lot of podcasters say. My top three would definitely be Ben Shapiro, Charlie Kirk and Bill O’Reilly. Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business owner I’m looking for hosts that approach a topic out of curiosity. I love the “All In” podcast for that reason. There’s four hosts, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Theyapproach topics from a point of curiosity. I also really enjoy Lex Fridman. He just interviewed Volodymyr Zelensky. Those can be difficult because Lex’sinterviews are often three hours, but the legacy media is so anti-intellectual that it drives me to long-form content. I want to get to really know how people got to their beliefs. Ken, 39, western U.S., Pacific Islander, Democrat, teacher Yeah, Joe Rogan usually does interviews that are three hours long. It’s very difficult for a guest to keep a persona for that length of time. You’re going to let your guard down. You’re going to get asked questions where you might have to admit you’re wrong. I will be working out, jogging, free weights, listening to thepodcast. Moderator, Patrick Healy What kinds of things are you learning from these podcasts? Do you feel it’s more valuable than what you learned in school? Ron G., 55, Kentucky, white, Republican, nurse Back in my college days, I probably didn’t have as much interest in politics or learning any more than what I needed to learn. Today, I’m a family man. I havemore interest in what’s going on in the country and how it affects me and my family and my growth for the future. Church and faith have probably caused me tolean towards trying to find out what’s going on about current events. Moderator, Patrick Healy Is there a difference between your male friends and your female friends, in termsof who each group follows on podcasts or YouTube or where they get their information from? Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister Yes. That’s probably why I like listening to Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk. I have friends who are ultrafar left or ultrafar right. I was the first conservativeRepublican in my family. There’s a lot of butting of heads. Listening to those podcasts sometimes gives me an insight into how I can approach a conversation withsomebody. Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business owner My hunch is that men are more prone to listening to long-form content, which I think was indisputable on the right this election cycle. Men have more solitaryjobs where they can listen to long-form content; we’re on the road. Females just have more family responsibilities. It’s hard for a female to sit down for threehours and listen to Joe Rogan or Lex Fridman. It’s easier for dudes. Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorney My female friends probably have less overall interest in political podcasts. You probably see less of the Joe Rogans and testosterone-fueled podcasts and moretraditional, intellectual, Ben Shapiro types. Not exactly a testosterone-producing podcast. Rich, 54, New York, Latino, Democrat, construction Years ago, I would listen to a different left-leaning podcast. And then I felt lied to. Moderator, Patrick Healy Is there something they lied about, do you think, Rich? Rich, 54, New York, Latino, Democrat, construction Russia. And I felt like they lied to me about the lacrosse kids with Duke. They just were so emphatic that they were guilty. I just checked out. They lost me.Years ago, I was a big Ed Koch fan, and I remember going to see him. And he said to me and my group: If you agree with me 80 percent, vote for me. If you agreewith me 100 percent, go see a therapist. And I kind of live my life that way when I listen to news. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Let’s switch gears a little. What’s a word that describes how you feel things aregoing in America? Walter, 65, New York, white, Republican, consultant Stagnant. Brett, 62, California, Black, Democrat, retired In need of a change. Ron G., 55, Kentucky, white, Republican, nurse Financial insecurity. Ron W., 39, California, Black, independent, construction Uncertain. Luis, 39, Florida, biracial, Democrat, unemployed Surviving. Ken, 39, western U.S., Pacific Islander, Democrat, teacher Surviving an uncertain economy. Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business owner Optimistic. Rich, 54, New York, Latino, Democrat, construction S-show. Glen, 59, Florida, white, Republican, community manager Confused. Andy, 60, New York, white, Republican, service manager Challenging. Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister Chaotic. Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorney Optimistic. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Matthew and Jon, my two optimists, tell me why. Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorney It seems like woke culture is being pushed back. And I don’t just mean politically with the election. It just seems like common sense is starting to make a comebackin the psyche of Americans, corporations and others. At least that’s my hope. Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business owner I couldn’t say it much better than Matthew. I think a lot will depend on the next 90 days — how confirmations to cabinet positions go. But for the first time in mypolitically aware lifetime, which probably starts in the 2000 Bush-Gore election, I feel like the incoming administration is more than a few degrees different thanthe outgoing one. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Michael, you said “chaotic.” Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister Well, I live in the heart of Chicago, and crime is rampant. We are a huge sanctuary city. The amount of illegal gangs that have infiltrated this city and the woke, liberal D.A.s that have allowed this criminality to exist are why Illinois, along with California, is one of the top mass exodus states in thecountry. So many people voted for this incoming administration because they know what they’re getting and there’s some common sense to “Hey, stop trying to forceother ideas on us.” Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Rich, I have to ask you about your PG-13 response, “S-show.” Rich, 54, New York, Latino, Democrat, construction Well, I’m with Matthew, Michael, and Jon, as far as hope for the new administration. But I live in Manhattan, on the Upper West Side near ColumbiaUniversity. I see the naïveté of the students. I see how New York is now charging us $9 to come into the city under congestion pricing. I see that poor woman who was lit on fire on the subway. The whole city is a mess. Life is about wrapping your head around situations. I cannot wrap my head around what they’re doing. Was the economy and the cost of living a top issue when you voted in November? Was the economy and thecost of living a top issue when you voted in November? 11 people raised their hands. Matthew, 43, Tenn., white, Repub. Ron W., 39, Calif., Black, indep. Ron G., 55, Ky., white, Repub.Rich, 54, N.Y., Latino, Dem.Michael, 52, Ill., white, Repub.Walter, 65, N.Y., white, Repub.Glen, 59, Fla., white, Repub.Brett, 62, Calif., Black, Dem.Ken, 39, western U.S., Pacific Islander, Dem.Luis, 39, Fla., biracial, Dem.Jon, 45, Pa., white, Repub.Andy, 60, N.Y., white Repub.Ron W., 39, California, Black, independent, construction Inflation was out of control. Rent goes up every year. Bills go up. Electricity goes up. Gas goes up. Part of the reason why I decided to vote for Donald Trump isbecause I actually believe that he’ll be able to help change a lot of that. Andy, 60, New York, white, Republican, service manager Although I’m happy Trump was elected, I think he’s going to have a very tough time getting the economy squared away. I work for a manufacturing company, and we havebeen decimated by foreign imports, to the point where I’m probably going to be without a job within the next year because these imports have taken away ourability to sell our product when overseas companies are selling them for less. I’m hoping Trump’s going to be able to get some tariffs put in place. I know there’s some people here that probably disagree with tariffs, but he’s got to dosomething. I’m in Staten Island, and I’ve also seen it drastically change for the worse. The cops’ hands are tied. These very loose liberal judges are letting themout with no bail back to being repeat offenders. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson We’ve talked about the economy, and we’ve talked about crime. Are there any other issues that were really top of your mind, a big driver in why you voted the wayyou did in this past election? Walter, 65, New York, white, Republican, consultant Illegal immigration. I’m in upstate New York, and I know New York City was busing a lot of these refugees, whatever the hell you want to call them, up to the Albanyarea, putting them in hotels and spending millions of dollars on them. I mean, why can’t we spend that money on our American people? Why do we have to spend thatmoney on foreigners? I lived in Dallas, and it was sickening, because they would come to this country and want us to adapt to their customs and their language. When you go into McDonald’s, menus are in Spanish and not English. Learn the damnlanguage. I worked with a lady. She’d been here for 24 years and still couldn’t speak English. My descendants are Polish. They came to this country through EllisIsland with maybe nothing in their pocket. But they worked hard. They got a job. They formed communities. But they bettered themselves. They didn’t look forgovernment handouts. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Give me a word that describes Donald Trump. Rich, 54, New York, Latino, Democrat, construction Leader. Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorney Fighter. Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister He’s a fighter. Glen, 59, Florida, white, Republican, community manager Erratic. Andy, 60, New York, white, Republican, service manager Leadership. Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business owner Change. Ken, 39, western U.S., Pacific Islander, Democrat, teacher Here we go. Ron W., 39, California, Black, independent, construction Proven. Luis, 39, Florida, biracial, Democrat, unemployed All over the place. Brett, 62, California, Black, Democrat, retired Change. Ron G., 55, Kentucky, white, Republican, nurse Change. Walter, 65, New York, white, Republican, consultant Rocks the boat. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Ken, tell me more about “Here we go.” Ken, 39, western U.S., Pacific Islander, Democrat, teacher You’ve got DOGE, and what is that actually going to do? Sometimes we don’t like bureaucracy or certain things that happen when it comes to dealing with certainagencies, but sometimes you don’t want to take an ax to everything. You’ve got the people around him like Elon Musk who look at the economy from a businessstandpoint. But your dinner table economics is very different from a government standpoint. So it’s going to be very interesting to see what programs get cut, what programs get increased and the framework of how they view economics helping. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Andy, you said Trump was a leader. Andy, 60, New York, white, Republican, service manager I think he’s got the ability to reach across the aisle and motivate the other side into agreeing with him on some key issues. One of the biggest is immigration. I’mall for immigration. If you’re bringing an education or a trade and you come to this country legally and you’ve got something to contribute, by all means, you arewelcome. My grandparents were immigrants. They came here legally, they worked hard, and they built a better life for themselves and their families. Allimmigrants are welcome. Just come here legally. So he’s got to start there. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Some of you said Trump is a fighter. Who is Donald Trump fighting, or who is he fighting for? Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister When they did the first assassination attempt on Trump, the way he bounced back — that’s just not something that you train to do. That’s instinct. It was aninstinct to say what he said and do what he did. He cared about the people and was willing to jump up and fight for it. And as a person who’s been in the service andwho’s been shot in the service but also shot growing up in the city, I know what it takes to bounce back from something like that. That’s about integrity and less about politics. That’s why I know for sure he’s a fighter. If you keep overtaxingcompanies, keep putting these Orwellian policies on them or trying to stranglehold them, they’re not going to survive, and you’re going to lose the economy, andpeople aren’t going to work. I think that’s what Trump is fighting. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Were you surprised there were assassination attempts against Trump? Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister I wasn’t. Ron W., 39, California, Black, independent, construction I was very surprised. I mean, I know it’s happened before in history. But the timing of it all, it just caught me off guard. Ron G., 55, Kentucky, white, Republican, nurse There’d been a lot of pushing to get him as a criminal, put him in as a criminal. And then that didn’t seem to be working. That’s where I feel like theassassination took place. I’m not saying I think it was the left side doing it or causing it or promoting that. But I’m not surprised there was an attempt on hislife. And I think him bouncing back is not a surprise, either. He’s an American that loves his country and that he’s ready to fight for it and take it and lay his life down, like a serviceman would. Moderator, Patrick Healy Trump is coming back into office next week. Is there anything you’re excited tosee him do as president? Brett, 62, California, Black, Democrat, retired I’m very excited that he’s going to close the border. I’m in California where theborder is, and I see busloads of illegal aliens being dropped off in my neighborhood. Glen, 59, Florida, white, Republican, community manager I used the word “erratic,” but I think it’s a positive. From a military defense standpoint, I think people don’t know what he’s going to do, but they know he’sgoing to do something and he takes a stand and doesn’t back down. I think other leaders respect that. Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business owner I’ve been an Elon Musk fan since before probably most of you knew who Elon was. And the fact that I have a chance to live in an America where Elon and VivekRamaswamy are charged with ridding the government of fraud, waste and abuse — that’s the America I want to live in. Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister Trump is going to make us energy independent again and open up our oil reserves. This way, we’re not codependent upon foreign adversaries. And I think Trump has alot more respect for the military. I have no respect for the ultraleft wing of the Democratic Party — especially after the Afghanistan debacle — because they made ajoke of the military. Benghazi was bad enough, but they made a joke of it. Luis, 39, Florida, biracial, Democrat, unemployed Address Social Security. Maybe something with people with disabilities, because I’m disabled myself. Moderator, Patrick Healy Is there anything you’re worried Trump might do as president? Or anything that youdon’t want him to do? Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business owner I hope he doesn’t get caught up in retribution and replaying old games. There waspart of me that hopes Joe Biden gives a blanket pardon to all these crackpots so Trump doesn’t even think about trying to prosecute any of them. Ken, 39, western U.S., Pacific Islander, Democrat, teacher One of the things on the chopping block is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Love them or hate them, it brought back about $12 billion to your averageperson because of things like bank drafts. Also, I don’t want to see troops leave Korea. Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorney Stick to the things we’ve talked about here. Ron W., 39, California, Black, independent, construction Save all the business for when you’re out of the office. Moderator, Patrick Healy Donald Trump did well in this election among men, including younger men. What do you think made Donald Trump appeal to men like you? Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister The answer is really simple. He talks to people directly as if we’re at a coffee table. He doesn’t talk down to us. He doesn’t look down to us like most Democrats do. He doesn’t talk down to us as some low-life minion. Andy, 60, New York, white, Republican, service manager He’s a man’s man, right? I actually had the honor of meeting him long before hewas president in some business dealings, and he’s an absolute true gentleman. He doesn’t beat around the bush. Moderator, Patrick Healy What does being “a man’s man” mean to you guys? Rich, 54, New York, Latino, Democrat, construction Responsible. A leader. Strong. When Trump walks into the U.F.C., that place explodes. Those are a bunch of testosterone men. Even when he went to the Army- Navy game, they love him. I think, not to sound morbid, but when Trump was shot, men just felt, “That’s a dude.” Ken, 39, western U.S., Pacific Islander, Democrat, teacher Mr. Testosterone. I work out, but I’ve dealt with a lot of people who are like that. What matters is: Can that person think? What’s their ability to strategize? What’s their ability to look at things in a different way? Ask the right questions? I’ve dealt with a lot of people who perceive leadership as the abilityto yell or think their physical prowess and ability to yell equal leadership. And that’s definitely not the case. Glen, 59, Florida, white, Republican, community manager Maybe I’m the minority here. Trump’s not a man’s man to me. I voted for him as the lesser of two evils. I believe in the defense of our country, I think he’s abusinessman, and I think people are looking at it and going, “You know what? I can buy a home. I can make more money.” I have a 34-year-old son, and I havegrandsons. Do I want them to talk to and treat people the way Trump does at times? Absolutely not. I think you can have strong opinions and get things accomplishedwithout being demeaning and divisive. If he could have just dialed it back, he wouldn’t have lost the 2020 election to Biden. Because of the way he treatedpeople, people didn’t want to hear it anymore. Brett, 62, California, Black, Democrat, retired I only believe in two genders: boys and girls. That’s it. No transgender. You got male genitalia, you’re a male. You got female genitalia, you’re a female. I thinka man’s man is just somebody who’s not soft. Change your own tire. Change your own oil. Put your own gas in your car. Guys nowadays can’t do that. Guys who are 22,they can’t change their own tire. You have to call somebody to help you. And it’s the parents’ fault. But a man’s man should be able to change his own tire. Should be able to not tweet out “covfefe” all the time. Be able to keep your tweets toyourself, especially the crazy ones. I agree that Trump is the lesser of the two evils because Kamala Harris would have been horrible. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Who comes to mind when you think of a man’s man? Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business owner My grandfather. Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorney John Wayne. Rich, 54, New York, Latino, Democrat, construction Yeah, my dad. Ron G., 55, Kentucky, white, Republican, nurse My father. Glen, 59, Florida, white, Republican, community manager Definitely grandfather. Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister I’m going to say Jesus Christ. Andy, 60, New York, white, Republican, service manager An uncle. Luis, 39, Florida, biracial, Democrat, unemployed I’ll go with Jesus. Ken, 39, western U.S., Pacific Islander, Democrat, teacher Eddie Murphy. Ron W., 39, California, Black, independent, construction My grandfather. Brett, 62, California, Black, Democrat, retired Martin Luther King Jr. Walter, 65, New York, white, Republican, consultant My grandfather. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Do you think there are generational differences between how older men and younger men think about the concept of being a man or masculinity? Ron G., 55, Kentucky, white, Republican, nurse Today it’s all how you were raised. I think that we’ve lost chivalry a little bit. I think that people are not as kind to each other. I think the way Trump talkssometimes is not appropriate to women or to people. But I also like his sternness in trying to make a point and get it across. Today’s generation of kids, they’renot as mindful. They don’t listen. They’re entitled, and I think that that’s the difference in the way I grew up and where I am today and to the kids today. I didn’t raise my kids that way. They’re hard workers, and they work hard to getwhat they get. Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister I do a lot of mentoring. A lot of the younger generation simply do not know how to have respect. It has been in the education system, the media, the entertainmentindustry. A lot of young people have no clue what it is to have respect, what it is to stand up and fight for what’s right, what it is to open up a door for alady, to show some respect. I’m not talking male chauvinism, but I’m just saying there’s some common respect for women. Most of us are working men of integrity whoare willing to fight for what’s right, and we’ll take the punches. A lot of this younger generation won’t do that. Do you think young men have it harder than young women in America today? Do you think young men haveit harder than young women in America today? 5 people raised their hands.

Something that would be perceived as chivalrous, you could get into a lot of trouble for. We’re litigious to beginwith, but everything’s about liability or just, if we’re going to go out, we have to sign this consent form. Jon, 45, Pennsylvania, white, Republican, business owner It’s tough to be a young man today. Go look at the website of any social organization, especially one that’s associated with the government. And you’llusually find a section called “who we serve.” If you look down through that list, they serve everybody but young white men. Other groups needed a lot of help at thetime, for good reason. Maybe the pendulum swung a little too far. Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorney I don’t think young women have it easy, either, just to be clear. But one of the reasons so many young men probably voted for Donald Trump is they’re havingtrouble finding their way in our current society. The things ranging from the # M e T o o movement, “believe all women, no matter what.” I think that intimidated a lot of young men. You look at academic scores. Boys, men are falling behind. You look at the feminization of men, where traditional male characteristics like courage, strength — things that used to be viewed as positive — are now viewed astoxic masculinity. Things like that have increasingly made young men feel like, “Where’s our place in society?” Ron G., 55, Kentucky, white, Republican, nurse Both sides are struggling. I probably would say men more so. But I think the whole issue of transgender people in women’s sports and issues of bathrooms and lockerrooms and so forth — I think it’s harder on women with that. Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson We’ve been talking about challenges that men in America face these days. I want to dig in a little bit more on the challenge around loneliness and social isolation.How hard is it to connect, to make friends, date and so on these days? What would be your theory for why more men report feeling lonely or more isolated? Michael, 52, Illinois, white, Republican, minister Some men just simply don’t know how to respond anymore in social circles. What used to be acceptable as chivalry, what used to be acceptable as being a man ofintegrity, everything you do and say now is under the ground. You’re scrutinized for everything. Maybe it’s just me, but most men will just go back into the safezone and say, “You know what? Why bother? I’m going to stick with what I know what works and what I know I need to do with my life and forget about everything else.” Men just don’t know where they fit anymore. Walter, 65, New York, white, Republican, consultant I’m 65 now. Going back to when I was younger, girls could bond over anything. When guys went out, if it wasn’t sports or something masculine, then guys couldn’t bond at all. And a lot of times if you tried to bond with somebody or just be friends with the guy, the guy would look at you like you’re just strange. And I think as Igrew up and aged, that kind of stayed with our generation. I work at a senior center, and every day they have a luncheon there for seniors. And out of about 30or 40 people there, I’d say 80 percent are women. And it’s because the women want socialization. We’ve got things for the men to participate in, but I don’t thinkthat’s something men would do. Andy, 60, New York, white, Republican, service manager Men are afraid to say anything anymore for the fear of offending somebody. I’vegot one young lady on my team who was the first female in our field service organization, and she has done wonderfully. But it didn’t come without a lot ofchallenges for her and for the men that are working with her to try to treat her equally while not offending her. It’s taught me to be a different kind of manager,having a girl on a team. Which is really unusual in our trade. But these men are so afraid to say anything that they’re going to get in trouble by offendingsomebody, right? No matter where they go. If you open a door for a woman now, sometimes they’ll look at you like, “Well, I don’t need you to hold the door forme.” If you’re on a subway and there’s a woman standing next to you, you stand up, and you give that lady the seat. If you’re walking down the street with a woman,you stand on the curbside. She walks on the inside, right? If you do that now, you’re looked at there’s something wrong with you. Matthew, 43, Tennessee, white, Republican, attorney I think I saw something about how the top 10 percent of men — over six feet tall, six-pack abs, six-figure income — 80 percent or 85 percent of women compete forthose men. The large group of men that are left are often isolated and lonely because there are fewer young women their age to have relationships with. I thinkit’s largely related to hookup culture. That’s created isolation, less socialization, more awkwardness and an inability for them to have meaningful connections and relationships with the opposite sex. Glen, 59, Florida, white, Republican, community manager For me, it boils down to two words: “vulnerable” and “intentional.” In the last year, I got divorced. I’m living on my own. I don’t have kid stuff to deal with anymore. So I had to be intentional. I’ve gotten involved in men’s groups through my church. There’s areas where you can volunteer. If I sit at home and go, “Well,I’m worried about what do people think,” then I’m going to be lonely. Technology can be great, but I think our young people have not learned how to communicate andsocialize because they hide behind a keyboard or a gaming station and don’t know how to have conversations like we’re having here. I think we’re doing a disserviceto our young people by not helping them be in more social settings where they’re learning how to treat each other with dignity, manners, respect, even in ourdifferences. You don’t have to be lonely. But you’re going to have to be vulnerable. And you’re going to have to be intentional about having things goingon in your life, because they’re not going to just fall in your lap or knock on your door.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
