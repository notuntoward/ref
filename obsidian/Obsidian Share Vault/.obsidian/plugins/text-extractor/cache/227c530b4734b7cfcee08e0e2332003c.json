Dispatch of 100K assets in VPP Programs {Simple Day ahead event} Assume 50 K System in California, across various LMPs {Price Threshold based event dispatch) Assume another 50K System in TX, responding to ERCOT Day ahead market prices – No Co-optimization Threshold based dispatch Based on Day-Ahead Market Prices Full Charge events when Price falls below $XX Full Discharge events when Price exceed $XX Demo should include 1st party ONLY Assume that the assets are distributed in various LMP’s and Zones across CA or other markets AI Side of the Demo: Aggregation of asset telemetry. {Open Questions/Thoughts} What is not included in this demo. Future demo could include 3rd party h/w. ToU + VPP Optimization. The Demo assumes the customer sited system will be operated in Native Self-Consumption and only respond to pre-scheduled events. The assets should respond to the VPP events scheduled manually/automatically in response to price spikes. Forecasting: If we structure the demo around Day-ahead LMPs/Nodes, can @Jon Lim confirm what we need? I would assume we can ingest prices similar to weather forecasts and just create a threshold-based response strategy Edge Optimization: Not part of this demo. We can say this will come down the road as part of our AC System launch and improve after the initial launch. Edge Optimization would become pertinent only for Qcells 1st party h/w. Since we are the OEM, we’d like to ensure our hardware can handle ToU/Rate + Weather (Storm events) and VPP Events. For 3rd party h/w we can assume the OEM is handling the Rate and Weather Events, while Qcells only dispatches events. AI usecases: Intelligent battery management to account for Storm Watch Mode + VPP events for 1st party h/w.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
