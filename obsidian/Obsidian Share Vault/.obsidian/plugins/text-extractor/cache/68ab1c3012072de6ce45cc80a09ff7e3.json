Motivation T HE integration of wind power is increasing rapidly in many electric energy systems throughout the world [1]–[4]. Two main driving forces motivate this raise: the in- creasing price of fossil fuels (natural gas, oil, and coal) as less and less reserves are available and the need to curtail carbon emissions to preserve a functioning atmosphere. As the wind power technology matures and reaches break- even costs, subsidies turn out to be less and less relevant, and wind producers become interested in participating in electricity markets to maximize their proﬁts. This is particularly the case for producers owning wind farms at different network locations, which have the possibility of combining their wind production resources and offering power generation portfolios to partici- pate in different short-term trading ﬂoors within a fully ﬂedged electricity market. However, wind power is undispatchable and plagued by the major uncertainty that constitutes wind availability. Thus, the market strategy of a wind producer must hedge against this un- certainty to be proﬁt effective and to dampen the proﬁt vari- ability due to very signiﬁcant wind ﬂuctuation. In addition to un- certainty on wind availability, the wind producer must also cope with uncertain market prices. In this context, due to the nondis- patchable nature of wind power production, no risk-hedging in- strument (e.g., a forward contract) is available for wind pro- ducers other than modifying their offers in short-term markets. The pernicious effect of production uncertainty is eliminated by a balancing mechanism that allows covering the lack of pro- duction of uncertain sources, such as wind power. The balancing mechanism is provided by energy sources that are generally ex- pensive but dispatchable, such as combine cycle gas turbines. As a wind producer needs to rely more and more on the bal- ancing mechanism, its proﬁtability deteriorates quickly. Thus, a key concern of a wind producer should be to reduce its need for balancing energy. B. Approach The uncertainty sources faced by a wind producer are specif- ically four: 1) wind availability; 2) the hourly price of the day- ahead market; 3) the hourly price of adjustment markets within one day (one or several of these markets can be considered); and 4) the hourly price of the balancing energy resulting from the balancing mechanism. We consider a fully ﬂedged multimarket trading ﬂoor in- cluding the day-ahead market, a single adjustment market (sufﬁciently liquid and closing just prior to actual opera- tion), and a real-time energy balancing mechanism. Also, the production mix is assumed to be compatible with such a market structure, i.e., the wind penetration allows the proper functioning of the day-ahead and adjustment markets. Within this market framework, we develop a multistage stochastic programming model (see [5] or [6]) that embodies risk control on proﬁt variability and provides optimal offering curves for the day-ahead market. The offering strategy is derived for the day-ahead market, but analogous offering strategies can be derived for the adjustment markets in a straightforward manner. For the risk-neutral case, we provide the value of the stochastic solution (VSS) and the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). In addition, we illustrate the gains associated with risk control in terms of proﬁt stability for a very moderate reduction in expected proﬁt. The VSS is a metric that allows assessing the effectiveness of a stochastic programming approach (see [5] or [7]). It is deﬁned as the difference between the expected proﬁt of the stochastic model and the expected proﬁt obtained from the problem, where the decisions variables are ﬁxed to those resulting from the associated deterministic problem, i.e., the problem in which stochastic variables are replaced by their respective expected values. On the other hand, the EVPI is an index measuring how much the wind producer would be willing to pay to know the future realizations of the stochastic processes under consideration (market prices and wind availability). It is calculated as the difference between the expected proﬁt resulting from the problem, where the decisions to be made anticipate the subsequent outcomes of the random variables and the expected proﬁt of the stochastic model (see [5]). Speciﬁcally, we compute this metric by assuming perfect information on each stochastic process separately in order to quantify the relative importance of each source of uncertainty that is considered. C. Literature Review To deal with the ﬁnancial losses stemmed from the variability and uncertainty of wind power, three main approaches have been proposed in the literature. One of them is based on the combined and coordinated use of wind power and energy storage technolo- gies (pumped-storage facilities, compressed air facilities, etc.) [8]–[11]. Another relevant approach is presented in [12], where ﬁnancial options are introduced as a tool for wind producers to hedge against wind generation uncertainty. The third approach focuses on designing stochastic models intended to produce op- timal offering strategies for a wind producer participating in an electricity market on its own [13]–[15]. The research presented in this paper follows this last approach and, in particular, introduces signiﬁcant advances in the line of research initiated in [15], where stochastic programming is used to generate optimal offers for trading wind generation in short-term energy markets. These advances have to do with im- provements in the mathematical formulation of the problem, the consideration of risk management, and the analysis of the ben- eﬁts of including an adjustment market within the market struc- ture from a wind producer perspective. D. Contributions The contributions of this paper are fourfold: 1) to provide a tool to derive hourly offering strategies (curves) for a wind producer operating within an elec- tricity market involving various trading ﬂoors and a balancing mechanism; 2) to express the tool in 1) as a linear programming problem, which can be efﬁciently solved using commercially avail- able solvers; 3) to provide an effective way to limit the risk of the proﬁt variability of the wind producer at the cost of a small re- duction in its expected proﬁt; 4) to analyze and discuss in detail a realistic case study. 556 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2010 II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION A. Market Framework Consider a wind power producer participating in a pool-based electricity market that includes three independent and succes- sive short-term trading ﬂoors: the day-ahead market, the adjust- ment market, and the balancing market. We consider that the wind producer has no market power capability in either of the aforementioned markets, and that its objective is to maximize its expected proﬁts from trading energy in the day-ahead and adjustment markets and minimize the imbalance cost incurred in the balancing market. Each one of the three markets is cleared through a single auction process. The time framework for market clearing is as follows. The day-ahead market concerning the whole day d is cleared at 10 A.M. of day . Because of the signiﬁcant delay between the closure of this market and the beginning of the en- ergy delivery period (14 h), the electricity pool includes an ad- justment market, where it is possible to take corrective actions. These actions are intended to reduce or eliminate the differences between the expected production and the schedule cleared in the day-ahead market. This adjustment market is of especial rele- vance for wind producers, as it allows them to incorporate into their offers the certainty gained during the time interval between the closure of both markets by updating their generation fore- casts, thus reducing the associated uncertainty. In this paper, we consider that the adjustment market is cleared very close to the delivery horizon (e.g., one hour or half an hour before). It should be noted that additional adjustments markets can be considered. Finally, the balancing market ensures the real-time balance between generation and demand by offsetting the differ- ences between the real-time operation and the last energy pro- gram cleared in the markets. For this reason, this market remains open until 15 min before the delivery hour. Therefore, through this last market, energy imbalances are corrected and priced ac- cording to the settlement mechanism for imbalance prices ex- plained below. The electricity market of the Iberian Peninsula motivates this modeling framework [16]. B. Mechanism for Imbalance Prices Imbalance prices result from the system balancing market, in which the price of the energy replacing the deviation is deter- mined. In the wholesale electricity market of the Iberian Peninsula, like in the rest of European electricity markets, a price for the positive energy deviation (higher production or lower consump- tion than scheduled) and a price for the negative energy devia- tion (lower production or higher consumption than scheduled) are settled for each time period. These prices represent the cost of the energy required to counteract the unplanned deviations, and consequently, they depend on the sign of the imbalance as a whole (system imbalance). Speciﬁcally, the following. 1) If the system imbalance is positive (excess of generation), then (1) (2) In order to palliate the excess of generation in the system, the operator uses the balancing market where producers submit offers to repurchase the energy previously sold in the day-ahead market. Assuming a rational behavior, producers are only willing to repurchase the excess of energy at a price smaller than the day-ahead market-clearing price . Thus, those market par- ticipants causing the positive system imbalance are remunerated for their overproduction at . As a result, they obtain a proﬁt smaller than the proﬁt they would have achieved if they had sold their overproduction in the day-ahead market. On the contrary, those market partici- pants producing less energy than that resulting from the day-ahead market, and consequently helping to alleviate the positive system imbalance are just paid at for their actual production, and so they do not incur imbalance cost. 2) If the system imbalance is negative (deﬁcit of generation), then (3) (4) In this case, the operator organizes a balancing market to which producers submit additional selling offers. Again, assuming a rational behavior, producers are willing to produce the amount of energy required to cover the deﬁcit of generation at a price higher than the day-ahead market-clearing price . The cost of this transaction falls on those market participants responsible for the system imbalance. In this sense, note that, as the price of this additional energy is higher than the actual price of the energy traded in the day-ahead market, the balancing process implies a proﬁt loss for these market participants with respect to the proﬁt they would have obtained by selling only their actual production in the day-ahead market. On the other hand, those market participants producing more than agreed on the day-ahead market, and consequently contributing to mitigate the negative system imbalance are paid at for their overproduction, and hence they do not incur imbalance cost. From the above discussion, it follows that and . It is important to emphasize that according to these criteria, those participants who offset the system imbalance, i.e., those participants who contribute to restore the system balance, are not penalized, which is a rational and reasonable assumption. C. Wind Producer Revenues Consider a wind power producer that offers and gets accepted a level of energy into the day-ahead market for time period , but actually generates . For the sake of simplicity, no ad- justment market is considered in this exposition. The revenue of this wind power producer for period is (5) where is the imbalance income resulting from the balancing process and may be negative, i.e., it may represent a cost. The total deviation incurred by the wind producer is deﬁned as (6) MORALES et al.: SHORT-TERM TRADING FOR A WIND POWER PRODUCER 557 and consequently, is given by . (7) According to expression (6), a positive deviation means produc- tion surplus and a negative deviation represents a deﬁcit of pro- duction. Therefore, is the price at which the wind pro- ducer will be paid (charged) for its excess (deﬁcit) of generation. Lastly, if we deﬁne (8) (9) then . (10) Note that deﬁnitions (8) and (9) are valid under the assump- tion that the hourly electricity prices in the day-ahead market are positive, i.e., . This is consistent with the price be- havior in most electricity markets, and particularly, with the one in the Iberian Peninsula, which motivates this study. Ratios and would need to be redeﬁned for other market structures where zero prices in the day-ahead market do frequently occur. D. Stochastic Programming Approach The wind producer problem described above is subject to four sources of uncertainty, namely the day-ahead market price, the adjustment market price, the wind power generation, and the price for imbalance. Among these sources of uncertainty, the one associated with the wind power production constitutes the keystone of the decision-making process. Given that the wind production is characterized by zero generation cost, its unpre- dictable nature is directly responsible for the likely loss of gains incurred by the wind power producer through the imbalance cost. In order to account for the impact of these sources of un- certainty on the wind producer offer, we propose to charac- terize them as stochastic processes and solve the wind producer problem stated above by using a multistage stochastic program- ming approach, wherein each stage represents a market. The se- quence of stages and decisions is as follows. 1) Design the offer strategy for the day-ahead market and submit the resulting energy selling offers to this market for each period of the market horizon. In this stage, decisions are made based on plausible realizations of the stochastic processes involved, namely, market prices (day ahead, ad- justment, and balancing) and wind power production. 2) Once the day-ahead market price is known for each time period, decide the amount of energy to sell/buy in/from the adjustment market. Speciﬁcally, at the moment that this decision is made, the 24-hourly day-ahead market prices and the wind power generated in the time periods between the closures of the day-ahead and adjustment markets are known. On the contrary, the adjustment and balancing market prices, and the wind power production for the rest of the market horizon are still uncertain. Therefore, in this second stage, and for every day-ahead market price real- ization, decisions are made based on plausible scenarios of adjustment and balancing prices, and of wind power production. Note that the wind production scenarios, span- ning the whole market horizon and available at this second stage, are generated knowing the actual wind production in the periods between the closures of the day-ahead and adjustment markets. 3) The last stage of the stochastic programming approach is determined by the materialization of both the imbalance prices and the wind power generated in the time periods spanning the whole market horizon. Thus, the deviation incurred by the wind power producer in each one of these periods is known and the consequent cost for imbalance can be computed. E. Uncertainty Characterization Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models [17] have been used to characterize the following. 1) The price series in the day-ahead market. 2) The difference between the price series in the adjustment market and the price series in the day-ahead market; working on this difference allows preserving the strong correlation between both price series. 3) The series deﬁned as: . Note that the ratio series and can be directly derived from by applying the rules (1)–(4) governing the mechanism for imbalance prices described in Section II-B. In particular, it holds that, if , then , and vice versa. In addition, note that series can be linearly expressed as . Fig. 1 illustrates a graphical explanation of the modeling of imbalance price ratios. To generate price (day-ahead, adjustment, and balancing) scenarios, we use seasonal ARIMA models because these models provide appropriate accuracy for moderate effort. Moreover, they are simple to derive and ﬁt. To characterize the wind speed uncertainty, the following second-order autoregressive model is used: (11) where represents the wind speed in time period , is white noise, and , , and are parameters estimated from histor- ical data. Autoregressive models have been proved to perform well for short time horizons. Giebel et al. [18] provide a good summary of the state of the art in models for short-term predic- tion of wind power. Once the wind speed scenarios are generated, they are trans- formed into power scenarios through the power curve associated to each turbine model installed in the wind farm. Then, under the assumption that the characteristics of the wind are the same all over the plant at each instant, scenarios representing the power output of the wind farm can be obtained by just aggregating the production of each available turbine in the plant. Note that it is not the purpose of this paper to develop an accurate charac- terization of the wind speed uncertainty, neither to illustrate a 558 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2010 Fig. 1. Graphical representation complementing the explanation of the modeling of imbalance price ratios. rigorous procedure to convert wind speed scenarios into wind power scenarios for a speciﬁc wind plant. The aforementioned stochastic models can be used to gen- erate price-wind power scenarios using a tree format. Note that this paper does not focus on scenario generation, and thus, we do not deal with likely correlations among market prices (day ahead, adjustment, and balancing) and wind production. The study of such correlations constitutes a subject that is outside the scope of this paper, requires further research, and affects solely the building of the scenario tree. Thus, the uncertainty characterizing the wind producer problem is modeled through a symmetric scenario tree that is speciﬁcally built as follows. 1) Generate price scenarios for the day-ahead market. 2) For each realization of the day-ahead market prices, simu- late price scenarios for the adjustment market. 3) For each scenario of the adjustment market prices, generate wind power realizations. 4) Finally, for each wind power realization, simulate im- balance price ratio scenarios. Hence, the total number of scenarios composing the tree is . An appropriate modeling of the uncertainty characterizing the wind producer problem should include the knowledge on the wind generation stochastic process gained during the time interval between the closure of the day-ahead and adjustment markets. This gain of certainty is due to the fact that the en- ergy selling/buying offer to submit in the adjustment market can be decided taking into account the realized values of the wind generation stochastic process for the time periods after the day-ahead market clearing. In order to reﬂect this circumstance within the scenario tree, we propose to generate wind speed scenarios as follows. 1) Simulate wind speed scenarios for the periods making up the time interval between the closure of the day-ahead and adjustment markets. 2) For each one of the wind speed scenarios generated in the previous step, simulate wind speed scenarios for the time interval spanning from the closure of the adjustment market and the end of the market horizon. It should be noted that each one of the wind speed scenarios generated in step 1 constitutes a series of past wind speed re- alizations from which the corresponding wind speed sce- narios are simulated according to model (11). Finally, also note that . For the sake of problem tractability, a fast-forward reduction algorithm as described in [19] is used in this paper to reduce the number of scenarios while still retaining the essential features of the original scenario tree. III. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION A. Basic Model The optimization problem to maximize the expected proﬁt of a wind power producer trading just in the day-ahead market can be formulated as follows: (12) (13) (14) (15) Note that, assuming zero generation cost for the wind pro- duction units, the expected proﬁt, i.e., the objective function (12), equals the expected revenue of the wind power producer. Equation (13) constitutes the deﬁnition, per period and scenario, of the imbalance income function. Constraints (14) limit the amount of power that can be sold in the day-ahead market, and (15) deﬁnes the total deviation incurred by the wind producer in each period and scenario. In order to model the imbalance income function ,a binary variable is used in [15] for each time period and each scenario . The resulting model is then formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. In this paper, an equivalent linear programming formulation is proposed with the consequent gain in robustness, simplicity, and com- putational efﬁciency. This linear formulation is presented next [(16)–(21)] and is based on decomposing the energy imbalance into the sum of a positive and a negative imbalances, and , respectively [see (19)]. Moreover, by means of this MORALES et al.: SHORT-TERM TRADING FOR A WIND POWER PRODUCER 559 decomposition, no binary variables are required due to the nature of the optimization problem tending to minimize the im- balance cost. In other words, for a given total energy deviation , the optimal solution is guaranteed to be achieved with one of the variables or equal to zero due to the fact that and . Constraints (20) and (21) below impose caps on the positive and negative deviations, respectively. The linear formulation is (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) Model (16)–(21) can be solved by decomposition into op- timization problems, one for each time period , because it does not contain any constraint or any decision variable coupling dif- ferent time periods. B. Offer Curves The mathematical model presented before is intended to ob- tain the optimal quantities (in a stochastic programming sense) to be sold in the day-ahead market (e.g., 20 MWh in hour 1, 65 MWh in hour 2, etc.). However, it may be convenient to derive optimal bidding curves for every hour of the day-ahead market. For this purpose, variables representing the power traded in this market for each time period are made dependant on scenarios , as in [20] or [21], and the following constraints are added to model (16)–(21): (22) (23) Constraints (22) make bidding curves nondecreasing, which is a requirement in most markets. Equations (23) are nonanticipa- tivity constraints, which model the fact that only one bidding curve can be submitted to the day-ahead market for each hour, irrespective of the wind power and imbalance price realizations. That is, this equation enforces nonanticipativity for the wind power and imbalance price realizations. Note that this model is less constrained than the basic one. In fact, the basic model can be obtained from this one by rewriting the nonanticipativity constraints (23) as . Despite including the aforementioned constraints, the offer strategy model continues being decomposable by time period (hour). C. Incorporating Risk Control The risk measure used in this study is the conditional value at risk at the conﬁdence level ( -CVaR), because this metric can be expressed linearly within an optimization problem and exhibits good mathematical properties [22]. If maximizing a dis- crete proﬁt distribution, -CVaR can be deﬁned approximately as the expected proﬁt of the scenarios with lowest proﬁt. The risk-constrained formulation of the problem faced by the wind producer is summarized as (24) subject to constraints (17)–(23) plus the following ones required for the linear formulation of the CVaR: (25) (26) The objective function (24) to be maximized includes the ex- pected proﬁt of the wind producer [ in (16)] and the CVaR of the proﬁt multiplied by the weighting parameter . This weighting factor enforces the tradeoff between expected proﬁt and risk in such a way that the higher the value of , the more risk averse the wind producer is. Thus, if the risk is not considered (risk-neutral case), then the value of is set to 0. Since risk is considered throughout the entire market horizon, then model (17)–(26) cannot be decomposed by time period. This is so because variables and , used to compute the CVaR over the total revenue distribution, couple the decisions pertaining to different hours. D. Adding an Adjustment Market The offer model of a wind producer having the opportunity to trade additionally in an adjustment market is as follows: (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) 560 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2010 (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) where is the number of time periods between the closures of the day-ahead and adjustment markets. Note that the consideration of the adjustment market entails three differences with regard to the mathematical model pre- sented in Section III-C: the ﬁrst one has to do with the objective function (27) in which the term is included to account for the revenue obtained from trading energy in the adjustment market. This revenue can be negative if the wind power pro- ducer decides to purchase energy from this market. The second difference is related to the calculation of the total energy devia- tion (31), which, in model (27)–(39), is carried out with respect to the ﬁnal energy schedule , i.e., the summation (29) of the amounts of energy traded in the day-ahead and adjust- ment markets. The last change consists in adding the nonantici- pativity constraints (37) for the decisions made in the adjustment market. These constraints express that the amount of energy traded in the adjustment market may be different, depending on the day-ahead market price realization and the wind power gen- erated after and before the closure of the day-ahead and adjust- ment markets, respectively. Furthermore, these constraints also ensure nonanticipativity with respect to the adjustment market and imbalance price realizations, and the wind power realiza- tion after the closure of the adjustment market. However, once the position in the day-ahead market is ﬁxed by using model (27)–(39), a model analogous to the one pre- sented in Section III-C can be employed to build offers for the adjustment market. IV. CASE STUDY A. Data We consider a wind farm having 40 2.5-MW commercial wind generators. The total installed wind power capacity of the plant is therefore 100 MW. To convert wind speed into wind power, the power curve for a standard simulated turbine (model Nordex N80/2500 with a hub height of 100 m) is used. This power curve can be found in the manufacturer database and is provided in [24]. All the turbines making up the wind farm are assumed to be operating for the considered trading day. The wind speed stochastic process is modeled through the second-order autoregressive model (11), whose parameters are ﬁtted using the publicly available wind speed data collected by Johnson from a location in the state of Kansas (U.S.) [25]. Speciﬁcally, the wind dataset used comprises average hourly speed measurements from January 25 to March 31, 1996. For clarity, the stochastic processes describing price be- havior in the day-ahead, adjustment, and balancing markets TABLE I STOCHASTIC PROCESSES FOR PRICES AND PRICE FUNCTIONS are modeled using simpliﬁed seasonal ARIMA models. More reﬁned multiseasonal models can be employed instead, as those described, for instance, in [17]. Likewise, a more sophisticated modeling of balancing power market prices is proposed in [26], where seasonal ARIMA and Markov processes are combined to capture the particularities of such prices as, e.g., the existence of periods with no demand for balancing power. The ARIMA models ﬁtted for the day considered in this case study (April 1, 2008) are provided in Table I. The historical data used for the ﬁtting process belong to the electricity market of the Iberian Peninsula [16], and are publicly available in [23]. These data correspond to the working days between October 2007 and March 2008. Only working days are considered in order to simplify the ARIMA models by eliminating the weekly seasonality. The numbers of scenarios for the day-ahead, adjustment, and balancing markets are, respectively, 1000, 1000, and 1000. The number of scenarios simulated to characterize the wind gener- ation uncertainty is also 1000, resulting from the combination of 20 scenarios representing the wind power realizations in time periods between the closures of the day-ahead and ad- justment markets, and 50 scenarios to embrace the pos- sible wind power realizations after the clearing of the adjustment market. The total number of scenarios comprising the original sce- nario tree is therefore , which clearly yields an optimization problem that is intractable. Hence, to achieve tractability, a scenario reduction technique [19] is applied to each sto- chastic process, resulting in ten, ﬁve, and ten scenarios for the day-ahead, adjustment, and balancing markets, respec- tively, and twenty scenarios for the wind farm production . Thus, the reduced scenario tree includes 10 000 scenarios. Finally, a conﬁdence level is used to compute the CVaR in all instances. B. On Offer Curves and Risk Control In this section, no adjustment market is considered. The VSS (risk-neutral case, ) is 2.294%, expressed as a percentage of the expected proﬁt obtained from model (17)–(26). This value justiﬁes the interest in using a stochastic model for solving the wind producer problem instead of a naïve deterministic one. In this case, offers to the day-ahead market just consist of an optimal energy quantity submitted at zero price for each time period. This is the case analyzed in [15]. However, these single quantities may turn into curves if the wind producer becomes risk averse . Table II shows the energy quantities offered to the market for different hours in the risk-neutral situation, and Fig. 2 depicts the resulting offer curves in the same hours if .

Impact of risk aversion on expected deviations. The changes undergone by the offer curves for increasing values are intended to reduce the expected energy traded in the day-ahead market as the wind producer becomes more risk averse. In fact, the policy that can be adopted by a wind power producer to hedge against proﬁt variability basically boils down to trading less energy in the day-ahead market in hopes that its additional production can be sold in the balancing market at a still competitive price. Consequently, as the risk aversion in- creases, the expected negative deviation incurred by the wind producer all over the market horizon decreases at the expense of rising the expected positive deviation. This is shown in Fig. 3. Nevertheless, unlike submitting just a single energy value for each time period, offering curves allows reducing the expected energy placed in the day-ahead market while still keeping the TABLE III EXPECTED VALUES OF PERFECT INFORMATION possibility of trading greater amounts of energy for high price realizations. It should be noted that for a market requiring step- wise offer stacks (the case of the market in the Iberian Penin- sula), the linear blocks of the stacks shown in Fig. 2 should be approximated by stepwise functions. In Table III, the expected values of perfect information, EVPI (risk-neutral case, ) are shown as improvements in per- centage with respect to the expected proﬁt obtained from model (17)–(26). In light of the results presented in this table, the fol- lowing two comments are in order. First, the economic improve- ment produced by a perfect knowledge of day-ahead market prices is smaller than the other two, which reveals that the uncer- tainty associated with these prices plays a secondary role in the wind producer offering problem. Moreover, this economic im- provement is nil. This is due to the fact that, under the assump- tion that wind generation is free, the maximization with of the objective function (24) boils down to the minimization of the imbalance cost. This cost depends on and , but is independent of . Second, the economic improvements due to perfect information on wind production and imbalance price ra- tios are equal. The reason for this is that knowing the values of and in advance is equivalent to know perfectly the future wind production availability from a strategic point of view. Finally, to assess the impact of the volatility level of the imbalance price ratios on the VSS, the VSS is also computed considering two additional volatility levels for these price ratios, 0.40 and 0.58 (values averaged over the 24-h market horizon), which result in VSS of 2.573% and 3.097%, respec- tively. Taking into account that the original volatility level and VSS are 0.22 and 2.294%, it can be concluded that the higher the volatility of the imbalance prices, the higher the VSS, and the higher the interest of the proposed model. C. On the Effects of Including an Adjustment Market Next, we analyze the advantages of including an adjustment market within the market structure from the perspective of a wind producer. These advantages are contingent on the liquidity of this market. In other words, adjustment markets with ade- quate levels of liquidity are required to take full advantage of the proposed technique. Roughly speaking, the effects produced by an adjustment market are twofold. 1) As a trading ﬂoor, it provides the market participants with additional trading options. As a result, the expected proﬁt increases and/or its variability decreases. 2) The clearing of this market is closer to the delivery time, and therefore, trading can be carried out with a diminished level of uncertainty as for the availability of wind energy. This is of special relevance for a wind producer and consti- tutes the key issue to be analyzed in this section. Hereafter, this phenomenon is referred to as certainty gain effect and is mathematically expressed through the last line of (37). 562 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2010 Fig. 4. Impact of the certainty gain on expected wind producer imbalances. Fig. 5. Hourly reduction in expected deviation due to the certainty gain. Formally, the certainty gain effect can be deﬁned as the economic surplus that the wind power producer obtains if it builds its offering strategy for the day-ahead market, con- sidering that the subsequent energy trading in the adjust- ment market can be done with a greater level of certainty on wind energy production. In order to isolate this second effect from the ﬁrst one, the analysis performed below is based on a comparison between the results provided by model (27)–(39), depending on whether the certainty gain introduced by the adjustment market is consid- ered or not, i.e., depending on whether the second term of the AND condition in constraints (37) is included or not. To start with, if an adjustment market is considered in the stochastic model, the VSS for the risk-neutral case increases up to 3.273%, i.e., 0.979% more than the value obtained in the previous section. However, the VSS is reduced to 2.906% if the certainty gain is not taken into account. This result reveals that one of the most important advantages of using a stochastic model, instead of just a deterministic one, is indeed to consider this phenomenon. In Fig. 4, the expected total deviations incurred by the wind producer all over the market horizon are compared for different values of the weighting factor . The reduction in the expected total amount of imbalances due to the certainty gain associated with trading in the adjustment market is apparent. Fig. 5 shows the value of this reduction per time periods. Note that the de- crease in expected deviation is considerably more signiﬁcant for the ﬁrst few periods, in which the volatility pertaining to wind power generation is comparatively smaller. Needless to say, the reduction levels achieved in these ﬁrst periods could be kept for the rest of hours by including additional adjustment markets throughout the scheduling horizon. The certainty gain effect involves notable changes in the offer strategy of the wind producer, as can be observed in Fig. 6. In this respect, note that the expected amount of energy sold in the electricity market (see upper subplot representing the resulting Fig. 6. Impact of the certainty gain on the energy amounts traded in both the day-ahead and adjustment markets. energy schedule) decreases as the wind producer becomes more risk averse. As already pointed out in Section IV-B, this is the only possible policy that a wind producer can adopt to hedge against proﬁt variability on its own. However, note that this de- crease is less pronounced if the certainty gain effect is consid- ered in the stochastic offer model. To understand the reason for this, it should be taken into account that the certainty gain effect translates into a better knowledge on how to offer in the adjust- ment market in order to decrease the expected level of imbal- ances. Thus, for low levels of risk aversion, for which the devi- ations incurred by the wind producer are predominantly nega- tive (see Fig. 3), the amount of energy placed in the adjustment market diminishes in relation to the amount that would be sold if the certainty gain were disregarded in the stochastic model (see lower subplot in Fig. 6). The opposite effect is observed for higher levels of risk aversion in order to reduce the expected amount of positive imbalances appearing as a way to reduce proﬁt variability. On the other hand, if the certainty gain effect is modeled, the expected amount of energy traded in the day-ahead market (see central subplot in Fig. 6) drops so as to prevent greater expected negative imbalances or/and uneco- nomic energy purchases from the adjustment market. In terms of proﬁt, the improvements due to the certainty gain effect can be summarized by means of Fig. 7, which represents the optimal pairs (expected proﬁt, CVaR) obtained for different values of the risk aversion paramater . The resulting curve is usually referred to as an efﬁcient frontier. Note that the certainty gain effect produces a displacement of the efﬁcient frontier up- ward and to the right, i.e., a displacement in the direction of increasing expected proﬁts and increasing CVaRs. Again, this displacement could be ampliﬁed by adding to the market struc- ture additional adjustment markets throughout the scheduling horizon in a sequential manner. Finally, observe that a signif- icant CVaR gain is attained for a moderate expected proﬁt de- crease. For instance, if the certainty gain effect is included, the reduction suffered by the expected proﬁt when is increased MORALES et al.: SHORT-TERM TRADING FOR A WIND POWER PRODUCER 563 Fig. 7. Impact of the certainty gain on risk management (efﬁcient frontier). from 0 to 0.5 is 1.66%, which is considerably low in compar- ison with the increment of 31.36% experienced by the CVaR. The results presented in this case study support the use of adjustment markets as efﬁcacious trading ﬂoors to enhance the competitiveness degree of wind producers. However, if the proposed offering strategy model is extended to consider longer time horizons, the results obtained by the wind producer are expected to be better in terms of risk con- trollability as the day-to-day proﬁt volatility is greater than the volatility of proﬁt over longer time horizons. An immediate practical implication of this would be the ﬂattening of the ef- ﬁcient frontier illustrated in Fig. 7. Likewise, the results derived from the proposed optimization models are also contingent on the volatility of the stochastic pro- cesses involved (wind availability and market prices). In this re- spect, note that the higher such volatility is, the more advanta- geous is the use of the proposed stochastic approach over a pre- diction-based one. Stochastic programming allows increasing the expected value of the proﬁt distribution while keeping the risk of proﬁt variability under control, a risk that precisely stems from the volatility of the input stochastic processes. Concerning computational issues, all problems have been solved using CPLEX 10.2.0 under GAMS [27] on a Linux-based server with four processors clocking at 2.6 GHz and 32 GB of RAM. The CPU time required to solve the sto- chastic model (27)–(39) is lower than 4 s for all the simulations carried out. V. CONCLUSION The methodology proposed in this paper allows to identify bidding strategies for a wind power producer that entitle a high decrease in the risk of proﬁt variability for a comparatively low reduction in expected proﬁt. Additionally, this paper provides a procedure to quantify the beneﬁcial impart of a sequence of adjustment markets following the clearing of the day-ahead market. These adjustment markets, cleared between the clearing of the day-ahead market and the real-time operation, allow the producer to identify and submit offers considering a reduced uncertainty level on wind power production, which result in a comparatively higher proﬁt and a smaller risk. A comprehensive case study is used to illustrate how to identify the best offering strategies and the beneﬁcial effects of adjustment markets. Needless to say, the proposed offering strategy model should be supplemented with an appropriate methodology to generate scenario sets representing the stochastic processes involved in a precise manner. The higher the quality of these scenario sets is, the more accurate and reliable the results provided by the pro- posed model are, but the general conclusions presented earlier are equally valid. Lastly, the numerical results presented in this paper can be ex- tended by using a chronological simulator to actually simulate the wind producer market actions and their corresponding out- comes during one-year horizon (or any other suitable time pe- riod). Such a simulator requires scenario generation algorithms for market prices and wind power spanning one year, which are algorithms still under research. All in all, developing the referred simulator and conducting year-wide simulations con- stitutes a subject of further research. REFERENCES [1] N. Hatziargyriou and A.
