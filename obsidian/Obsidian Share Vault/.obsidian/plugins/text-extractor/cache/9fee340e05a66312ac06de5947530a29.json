This study applies the quantitative method to examine the proposed hypotheses. The questionnaires were distributed to Indonesian social media users who have eligible electoral rights. This study uses primary data collection and gathers 396 respondents via an online questionnaire. Further, SEM and path analysis methods were conducted to examine the data in this study. Social media marketing, candidate image, and religious beliefs positively affect the voter's intentions. The two dimensions of the social media marketing that directly influence a voter's intention are interaction and customization. This research limits the respondents to Indonesian media social users whom eligible have electoral rights. The findings of this research suggest several practical directions for candidate or political party and their team using social media marketing.

Social media also becomes an influential instrument for creating an opinion, including in political context lately. Political parties use social media as an instrument to communicate with their competitors, potential voters, and other related parties. Moreover, political parties or politicians consider using social media as their advertising purpose or marketing tool [1]. Social media has been significantly developed as a discussion medium for political activities in its various structures [2]. There are several candidates or electoral parties that have used social media as an efficient 2 campaigning tool. A successful campaign will also help to build a stronger democracy. Further, social networking sites have been progressively assuming a fundamental role in the 2019 Indonesian Presidential Election Campaign. In Indonesia, there are 268 million population in which 150 million of them are active internet users and social networking sites. In addition, they are mostly recognized as eligible voters with ages ranging between 18 to 34 years old. Typically, they use numerous virtual newsrooms or social networking sites and spend over 50% of their time over the Internet [3]. Indonesian people share their aspirations about the political candidate and presidential election. Also, they are involved in some conversations and discussions about the issues related to the candidates after a week of the live presidential debate on the television. Furthermore, some non-political accounts are also associated with political conversation to elevate the popularity of the candidates [3]. Currently, social media influences every aspect of human life, including in the elections. Social media has become one of the most important electoral campaign platforms, not merely in Indonesia but also worldwide. Social media has been expected as fair and competitive electoral strategies. Thus, politicians will take advantage of the incentives and start using websites for the campaign. Therefore, this research discusses social media marketing's influence on voters' intention with religious beliefs and candidate image as the mediating variables. Social media marketing consists of entertainment, interaction, trendiness, and customization. 2 LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1 Election and 2019 Indonesia General Election An election is an official procedure of choosing an individual for public office or the process to accept or reject political proposition in democracy system through voting [4]. Indonesia held a general election on April 17th, 2019. This election was the first moment in Indonesia's political history that simultaneously elect house or representatives both at national and local levels as well as the president at same day. More than 190 million of Indonesia's citizens participated in the general election. There are two candidates for the presidential election and sixteen political parties participated in the 2019 Indonesian general election. In September 2018, candidates' nominations for the general election, including the presidential election, were finalized. The period for campaigning was started from October 13rd, 2018 to April, 13rd, 2019. 2.2 Social Media Marketing Nowadays, social media is not only utilized to post activities and opinions among people, but also as e means of digital media marketing [5]. Social media marketing grows fast because of high market demand and plays a crucial role in people's daily routines. Costumers usually use their social networking for their decision- making process about certain products or services [6]. There are several advantages to use social media marketing. First, collecting more information in a relatively speedy way. Second, it can be used by companies as a media to communicate with consumers while they are in their purchasing process. Third, it can speed up word-of-mouth advertising, including the consumers' comments about their buying experience that may impact another prospective consumer [5]. This research discusses social media marketing adapted from Kim and Ko's proposed framework [7] in the Indonesian Election context. The social media marketing components 3 from Kim and Ko's framework [7] include entertainment, interaction, trendiness, and customization that will be further explained below: 2.2.1. Entertainment Entertainment can drive users of social media to some point [8]. Entertainment experience is important to boost the values of the brand or organization perceived by the individuals [9]. Entertainment in social media marketing points out that the information and substance formed by a specific brand give amusement and pleasure [10]. 2.2.2. Interaction Social interaction is a significant motivator for making users-created content [11]. Social networking sites can help users bringing more space to exchange opinions and discussions. Social networking website's intensive interactions can motivate individuals to change their intention to purchase [12]. Social media also can increase an individual's trust in the organization[13]. Feedback and interaction are the essential aspects of social media [14]. 2.2.3. Trendiness Social media delivers the newest information and hottest topics for discussions [15]. Social media helps the eligible voters to learn more about the candidate's latest information and understand better about the electoral agendas in a more advanced and modern way. Trendiness in social media marketing spreads the latest and the most common evidence about a specific political figure’s brand image for this research context [10]. The important thing for the brand on social media is to spread trending information and increase engagement among consumers and brands [16]. 2.2.4. Customization Individuals tend to seek information that fits their desires and preferences [17]. Customization in social media marketing points out that social media networking offers convenience in seeking customized services and information [10]. 2.3. Candidate Image The political candidate's key traits are intelligence, morality, power, credibility, leadership, and competence [18]. The candidate image can be measured based on personality attributes that characterize one or more aspects of the candidate's image [19]. The candidate image represents an overall evaluation of the candidates based on their personality traits [20]. Researchers found that when they studied voter behavior, they discovered that the candidate's image also played an important role in political elections [20]. 2.4. Religious Beliefs Religious beliefs are a group's practices, values, and beliefs taught by a spiritual leader [21]. There is a significant impact of religion on political behavior [22]. Religious beliefs in a political candidate are perceived as how the candidate/party's religious beliefs can influence voters' decisions on a candidate or political party [20]. Some researchers have explored religious beliefs in their perspectives [22]. 4 2.5. Voter's intention Voter's intention becomes a global issue regarding success and effective political elections [23]. The intention is termed as a person's premeditated or anticipated future behavior [24]. The intention is a person's willingness to vote in the upcoming election. Ben-Ur & Newman developed the model of voter behavior that the aim is to analyze the beliefs, attitudes, motives, intentions of the voter. This study used the key variable \"situational contingency\" that influences the potential voters' thinking of the election result [25]. 2.6. The Interrelationship between Social Media, Candidate Image, Religious Beliefs, and Voter's Intention Customer relationship has played a significant role in affecting consumers' luxury fashion brands [37, 38]. The finding revealed that the entertaining and interactive marketing via Facebook and mostly shared by followers could make a closer relationship between students and educational institutions and increase enrollment intention. For political context, media had a significant role in delivering the political brand to the voters' intention, and there was an extensive impact using social media by the political candidates or parties [20]. Therefore, it is supposed that: H1: SMM has a positively significant influence on VI Social media marketing had a positive impact on the company's brand image [26, 27]. Social media marketing had a significant effect on the organization's brand image in the sector of hospitality. This study proposes a positive relationship between social media marketing and a person's image [28] but associated in the political field, or electoral in specific. Other studies indicate that media had a significant role in delivering the political brand to the voters and there was an extensive impact using social media by the political candidates or parties [20]. Therefore, it is supposed that: H2: SMM has a positively significant influence on CI Media become the triggers of religious substance, aesthetic, the institutional, and technological qualities of the media impact the confining of religion and how users and audiences should interact with religion. Media may make virtual worlds and narratives that welcome individuals to have encounters of a religious-like character [29]. There is a complex relationship between digital media and the religiosity of Web 2.0 [30]. Media can be the space to transform the content of specific religions, rites, and beliefs. Social media provides the benefit to allow believers and non-believers by giving them space for easy interactions with each other [31]. Therefore, it is supposed that: H3: SMM has a positively significant influence on RB Seven factors affect the voter's intention to vote [19]. Furthermore, one of the most important factors that influenced a voter's intention is a candidate image. Another study confirmed that the candidate image also has significant domains determining the intention to vote [20, 32]. The finding revealed that voters' intentions also focused on the candidate image in political elections. The result mentioned that there is a positive relationship between the candidate image and the voter's intention. Therefore, it is supposed that: H4: CI has a positively significant influence on VI 5 Religious beliefs affect individuals' behaviors and attitudes [22, 33]. The impact of religion, including the ideologies of several religious groups, has changed over time on social issues. Individual's religious beliefs can affect their behavior and attitudes [34]. Religious beliefs had an impact on, particularly controversial products and social or political groups [35]. Another study discovered that the candidate and political party won the citizens' sympathy to vote for them during the elections by using the injections of their religious beliefs and ideologies [36]. Therefore, it is supposed that: H5: RB has a positively significant influence on VI 3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 3.2. Research Design and Variables The independent variable of this study is Social Media Marketing. There are four aspects of Social Media Marketing, namely Entertainment, Interaction, Trendiness, and Customization, that influence voters' intention, as presented in the figure 1 below. Figure 1. Research framework 3.3. Measurement and Scale This study gathers information based on the previous literature review with some modifications to fit the study's context. There are thirteen (13) items to measure social media marketing derived from two research [7, 10], five (5) items to measure candidate image derived from previous research [19], four (4) items to measure religious beliefs obtained from a previous study [21], and four (4) items to measure voter's intention derived from two previous studies [37, 38]. This survey uses the five-point Likert Scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. 3.4. Data Collection and Analysis A total of 396 valid questionnaires were collected from Indonesian social media users eligible for the election through an online questionnaire. Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) is used to analyze the data. Several statistical methods will be used in this study, such as Descriptive Statistical Analysis, Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Reliability Analysis or Cronbach's alpha, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). 4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Out of 396 questionnaires, 43.7% of them are male, and 56.3% of the rest are females. The respondents' ages are between 17 and 60 years old, and most of them range from 22–26 years (43.9%). Meanwhile, most 6 of the respondents had the highest education level at the bachelor's degree (64.9%). Over half of the total respondents (53.6%) are employees. In terms of religion, more than half of the respondents (70.2%) dominate by Muslims. In terms of using social media, most respondents use social media (100%), and most respondents (58.3%) use Instagram more often than other social media. 4.2. Construct Validity Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to measure the variables' loading and assess the validity of the measurement items. The latent components analysis with Varimax rotation was applied to discover the latent components of the measurement model item and maximize the squared loadings' total variances. Furthermore, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Barlett's Test of Sphericity were performed to verify the construct's validity and data collection feasibility. After undergoing several testing steps, five questionnaire items (ENT4, CUS1, CI5, RB2, and VI3) showed a factor loading value less than 0.50. After eliminating the five questionnaire items above, the questionnaire used in this research became more reliable. The KMO showed a better result = 0.80, with p-value = 0.00 and total variance extracted = 74.72%. CFA model analysis indicates overall fit. It shows the proposed model framework has a good level of fit: X2/df = 1.82, p value = 0.00, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) = 0.93, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.96, Tucker- Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.95, and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05 as presented in the Table 1 below. Table 1.

The overall results show that the validity and reliability of all components used in this study are considered good. 4.3. Path Analysis Result Structural Equations Modeling is used to analyze and assess the relations and hypotheses between research variables. SEM is used to determine the direction and significance of those relationships [40]. The detailed outcome of the model fit indices of the proposed framework model. X2/df = 1.98 with p-value = 0.00. Further, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) = 0.92, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.95, Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI) = 0.90, and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05. The standardized coefficients are used because the value of the coefficients is in the normalized units. As shown in Table 2 below, all hypotheses are supported. SMM positively influences VI with β= 0.285***, with the p-value = 0.000. SMM influence CI, proven by β= 0.411***, with the p-value = 0.000. SMM also affects RB, it 7 was proved by β= 0.367***, with the p-value = 0.000. CI to VI was supported with β = 0.249**, and RB to VI was also shown supported with β= 0.134*, with the p-value = 0.021. Figure 2 shows the path analysis results. Further, the hypothesis testing results are preseted in Table 2. Figure 2. The result of the Structural Equation Model (SEM) path analysis Table 2.

Discussion As several previous studies revealed that social media marketing has a positive influence on purchase intention [7, 41, 42], this study's results also get a consistent outcome with the former research. However, this study contributes some new knowledge and information as this study explores voter's intention that is not considered in the previous study. In line with that, this study indicated that social media marketing significantly impacts voter's intention (β = 0.285***). Therefore, it can be concluded that better management of social media marketing handled by a candidate or political party and their team will result in greater voters' intention to give a vote to them. From the statistical analysis results, it was also found that there were two dimensions of the social media marketing that significantly influence voter's intention in this study, namely interaction and customization. Former studies reveal that social media marketing positively affects the brand image [10, 26-28]. The results of this study also get a consistent outcome with the former studies. However, this study brings a person's image as its contribution since it is not considered in the previous study. In line with that, this study indicated that social media marketing significantly impacts the candidate image (β = 0.411***). It means that 8 candidate's image will become more positive if they can appropriately manage their social media marketing. From the statistical analysis results, it was also found that three dimensions of social media marketing significantly affect candidate image in this study, namely entertainment, interaction, and customization. The presented results reveal that social media marketing directly impacts religious beliefs (β = 0.367***). This study also reported similar results conducted by previous studies [29, 31]. However, this study contributes to some new knowledge and information because social media marketing significantly influence religious beliefs is not considered in previous research. So, it can be concluded that if the candidate can control their marketing on social media well, they will get the positively religious beliefs' impact. The statistical analysis results demonstrated that one dimension of social media marketing has a significant positive influence on religious beliefs in this research, namely entertainment. It has been confirmed that a candidate image directly and significantly impacts the voter's intention [19, 20, 32]. The result emphasized in this study indicated a significant positive relationship between the candidate's image and the voter's intention (β = 0.249***). It implies a better perception of the candidate image among voters' minds will lead to a higher voter's intention to vote. Voters may have a good or poor perception of the candidate that will directly influence the voting decisions. Farrag and Shamma revealed in a previous study about factors influencing voter's intention in Egypt that religious beliefs are one of the essential variables to Newman and Sheth's model [19, 20]. Moreover, another study also showed the same consistent results [36]. The statistical analysis outcomes show that religious beliefs significantly and positively influence a voter's intention (β = 0.134*). It means that if the candidate or political party can use religious beliefs as the political marketing tool appropriately, it will increase the chance for them to win the voters' sympathy. Religious beliefs are essential because they can affect every aspect of people's lives, including behaviors, attitudes, and preferences, especially in social and political ideas and groups. 5. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION Social media marketing has a significant influence on a voter's intention. Social media marketing has become one of the essential aspects of marketing. It is also can be considered as a political marketing tool and campaign. Social media provides easy to use and low-cost to share information about the election, the candidate or political party. If they can use social media appropriately, it will give many benefits and conveniences. This study's findings provide some practical aspects for the candidate of a political party and their team success who use social media as a political marketing tool. This study delivers an explanation of the aspects that become the basic considerations for voter's intention to vote for the candidate with social media marketing. Based on the results, social media marketing, candidate image, and religious beliefs significantly affected the voter's intention. Further, for managerial implications, there are two pivotal contributions. The aspects of social media marketing consist of entertainment, interaction, trendiness, and customization, and the whole of these dimensions impacts voter's intention to vote. First, two dimensions are more relevant and directly affect a voter's intention to vote in the election, namely interaction and customization. According to this result, the candidate and their team should pay attention and give more effort to develop those two dimensions to increase the potential voters. 9 Secondly, the candidate or political party and their team should not use social media marketing as only a tool to get the potential voters and as a useful tool for creating candidate image and religious beliefs since this study presents that candidate image and religious beliefs have a deeper meaning to voters. If they can manage to make the voters have a good perception of the candidate's image and religious beliefs will not be unwilling to vote for the candidate or political party. 6.
