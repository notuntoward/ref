You need an electrical permit any time electrical wiring is installed, altered, extended, or connected to any electrical equipment, including signs.  2020 Seattle Electrical Code Quick Reference (documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/2020SeattleElectricalCodeQuickReference.pdf) 2020 Seattle Electrical Code Replacement Pages (documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/2020SeattleElectricalCodeReplacementPages.pdf) You may not need a permit for some residential or minimally-sized low-voltage systems. Special events, such as street fairs, that have temporary power installations do require an electrical permit. Any professional applying for electrical permits must have a Washington State electrical contractor’s license (http://www.lni.wa.gov/) and a Seattle business license (http://www.seattle.gov/business-in-seattle/doing-business-in- seattle/business-licenses-and-taxes). Property owners may do their own work when they own and occupy the property they’re working on. Some projects require plan review and are not issued the same day. See Seattle Electrical Code Article 80 (documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/2020SeattleElectricalCodeArticle80.pdf), Sections 80.50 and 80.51, to determine if you need plan review. How Much Does It Cost? Our fees depend on what you are installing or altering. All fees are subject to an additional technology fee. See our Fee Subtitle for details. Fee Subtitle (documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/FeeSubtitleFinal.pdf) 2023 Electrical Plan Review Fees (documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/2023ElectricalPlanReviewFees.xlsx) How Long Does It Take? We issue many electrical permits on the same day that you apply online. If your permit requires plan review, our turnaround times depend on the accuracy and completeness of your plans, and the number of plans that are in the review queue. It will take a few weeks before we issue your permit if you don't need to make corrections. Steps To Get Your Permit Collapse all 1. Research Determine permitting and plan review requirements.

You may need permits or approvals from other agencies. These are the most common agencies you may need to work with for your electrical permit: Seattle City Light (service changes or new services (https://www.seattle.gov/city- light/construction-services/requirements-and-standards)) Fire Marshall (http://www.seattle.gov/\u0000re/fmo/fmo.htm) (alarms & sprinklers) Seattle Business Licensing (https://www.seattle.gov/city-\u0000nance/business-taxes-and- licenses/business-licenses) (required to do business in Seattle) 2. Submit Application First, determine if your project requires plan review. Which Electrical Permit Should I Choose? (https://seattlegov.zendesk.com/hc/en- us/articles/115004979048-Which-Electrical-Permit-Should-I-Choose-) If your permit does not require plan review: Most permits – You can apply online (https://cosaccela.seattle.gov/portal/welcome.aspx) by choosing the Permit – Trade, Construction, and Land Use link and then selecting the appropriate electrical permit. You can print your permit the same day. For permits with an electrical heater as the primary heat source, you will need a Heat Equipment Sizing Form (documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/SeattleEnergyCode/HeatingEquipmentSizing.xls) to apply. Small solar PV systems – If your solar PV system is rated under 7.7KW, you can apply online (https://cosaccela.seattle.gov/portal/welcome.aspx) without plan review. However, you must have your plans and the manufacturer installation instructions available at the job site during your electrical inspection.  If your permit requires plan review, you can submit your plans and speci\u0000cations electronically through the Seattle Services Portal (https://cosaccela.seattle.gov/portal/welcome.aspx) by choosing the Permit – Trade, Construction, and Land Use link and then selecting the appropriate electrical permit. Pay fees. You will need to pay your permit fees when you submit your application. See the 2023 Electrical Plan Review Fees (documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/2023ElectricalPlanReviewFees.xlsx) or the Fee Subtitle (documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/FeeSubtitleFinal.pdf) to estimate your permit costs. Make corrections and resubmit your plans. Once all of our reviews are done, you will receive an email telling you that corrected and/or additional documents can be uploaded into your portal. Your project may require multiple correction rounds before our reviews are complete.

If your permit does not require review, you can print your permit immediately after you apply. If your permit requires review, our electrical plan reviewers will issue your permit when your plans meet all our code. 4. Schedule Inspections The contractor or installer is responsible for scheduling each inspection online (https://cosaccela.seattle.gov/portal/Customization/SEATTLE/Welcome.aspx) or by calling (206) 684-8900 (tel:%20+1 (206) 684-8900) before the permit expires. You must have your permit number available when you call for an inspection. How to Schedule an Inspection or Appointment (https://seattlegov.zendesk.com/hc/en- us/articles/115004984887-How-to-Schedule-an-Inspection-or-Appointment) Most permits require three electrical inspections (/sdci/inspections/electrical-inspections): cover, service, and \u0000nal. If your project has a feeder to a subpanel, you will also need to schedule feeder inspections. These inspections can be done at the same time, but you must schedule them separately. To help not overload our inspections cap maximum, schedule only one inspection and contact your inspector on the morning of your inspection to notify them of any additional inspections you will need.  9/24/23, 8:41 P M Electrical P ermit - S D C I | seattle.gov https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/permits/permits-we-issue-(a-z)/electrical-permit#1.research 3/4 9/24/23, 8:41 P M Electrical P ermit - S D C I | seattle.gov https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/permits/permits-we-issue-(a-z)/electrical-permit#1.research 4/4 Construction and Inspections Nathan Torgelson, Director Address:700 5th Ave, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA, 98104 (https://www.google.com/maps/place/700 5th Ave, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA, 98104) Mailing Address: P.O.
