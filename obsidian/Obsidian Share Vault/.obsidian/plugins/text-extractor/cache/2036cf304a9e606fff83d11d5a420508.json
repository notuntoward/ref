Educational attainment and COVID worry within political parties Sara Helms McCarty 1a, Jonathan Davis 1b, and Rachel Hagues 1c 1Samford University aBrock School of Business, bOrlean Beeson School of Education, cSchool of Public Health Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic brought tremendous uncertainty into individuals’ lives. As the pandemic progressed in the United States, the partisan divide in attitudes toward COVID-19 dominated headlines, driven in part by the dismissive attitude toward the pandemic by some leaders. We explore differences in self-reported worry about COVID-19 as case levels fluctuate within states. We find that overall, Democrats are most worried about COVID-19 and react most to changes in case levels with more worry, followed by Independents, followed by Republicans. Across parties, the most educated group (college and above) react to more cases with more worry. However, among Republicans and Independents, lower education groups do not. Results using state-level death reports mimic the patterns of the case level results, though the coefficients are much larger. While the party divide is undeniable, education plays a key moderating role. Keywords: coronavirus, covid, worry, political party, education, Gallup Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020, introduced an unprecedented uncertainty into daily life. Individuals were suddenly pushed to evaluate risk of infection against the disruption incurred by avoiding or reducing this risk. Attitudes toward COVID risk splintered, as individuals responded with disparate worry levels about contracting the coronavirus. In the United States, the splinter appeared to align itself with political affiliation. This partisan divide dominated headlines, in no small part due to the rhetoric of political leaders. Many studies and surveys highlighted the difference in attitudes toward COVID and how preventive actions align with cultural and sociodemographic factors (Bavel et al., 2020; Collis et al., 2022). This dominance of political polarization is problematic in two ways: (1) the pandemic response is not unified, and thus wasteful and confusing for everyone (i.e., a divergent response is an indirect risk to all), and (2) by definition, one of the polarized groups is less likely to adopt evidence-based guidance to prevent infection, thus that group is at more immediate, direct risk. We explore this polarization in the context of worry about COVID through analyzing a large data set. We examine party affiliation as the factor that has emerged as the dominant influence in the pandemic response. We then consider education as a potential moderator, offering opportunities for intervention within the partisan context. Ideology and partisanship Over the last two decades, political psychologists published many studies about ideology “… demonstrating that liberals and conservatives diverge from one another in terms of: (a) personality characteristics; (b) cognitive processing styles; (c) motivational interests and concerns; (d) the prioritization of personal values; and (e) neurological structures and physiological functions” (Jost, 2017, p. 503). Thus, ideological labels can succinctly communicate information in a cultural frame that imbues it with morals, values, or beliefs that may motivate behavior (Kahan et al., 2012). Distinct from the ideology, partisanship refers to identification with a political party; partisanship may intensify ideology because it adds both identity and affiliation to the aforementioned ideals (Krishna & Sokolova, 2017). In this additive way, partisanship may further influence motivation and decision making. Partisanship and Decision Making Partisanship simplifies decision-making in one way by acting as a heuristic, thus making partisanship a useful cognitive and communication tool. Indeed, when partisan information is absent in political campaigns, voters tend to seek simplification of their decisions via use of heuristic/simplifying information that may be less relevant, such as incumbency, or the emotional expressiveness of a candidate (Krishna & Sokolova, 2017; Petersen, 2015). Additionally, partisanship itself can motivate strong awareness of social issues and engagement with others (Krishna & Sokolova, 2017). On the other hand, our ideology and partisanship can strengthen one another to such an extent that decision making is warped. Party affiliation can shape the partisan, leading to biased evaluation of information, such as self-serving judgments about policies, and even discounting or denying facts (Krishna & Sokolova, 2017). When extreme, partisanship can become a motivating factor that itself shapes reasoning to lead to partisan conclusions (Krishna & Sokolova, 2017). The strength of partisan identity may be related to cognitive inflexibility in processing all types of information (Zmigrod et al., 2020). Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 To add to this information processing view of how partisan bias shapes reasoning, scholars also identify emotions that intensify these biases even further. Anger, anxiety, and enthusiasm tend to be highly salient to information processing and motivated reasoning, and in some cases can overpower even partisanship in their effects (Holloway & Wiener, 2021; Krishna & Sokolova, 2017; Wischnewski & Krämer, 2021). The blending of ideology and emotion can be an especially powerful motivator, particularly for conservatives (Brady et al., 2019). When one’s ideals are intensified with partisanship and strong emotion, bias can shape one’s worldview. Such partisans develop hostility toward outsiders and affective polarization ensues (Druckman et al., 2021). In addition, intolerance of uncertainty tends to drive greater political polarization, so unprecedented and unpredictable events like the COVID pandemic likely enhance pre-existing divisions among partisans (van Baar et al., 2021). Indeed, 2020 marked the first time in decades that negative partisanship (dislike of the opposing party) seemed equally or more influential than positive partisanship (affinity with one’s own party) in certain groups (Lee et al., 2022). Polarization and the Pandemic In the context of a pandemic, polarization has potentially negative consequences for individual and societal health (Weber et al., 2021). Within a public health emergency the blunting of an effective and coherent response in even a portion of the population can increase risk for everyone. Partisan divisions influenced the way Republicans and Democrats responded to information about the pandemic, with Republicans being less worried about COVID and “less willing to support policies to mitigate the threat of the virus” (Druckman et al., 2021, p. 35). As a result, policymakers and public health officials must enact innovative strategies to bring people together despite partisan differences, especially when it comes to public health issues with life-or-death implications (Druckman et al., 2021). Two Approaches to Counteracting Polarization and Partisanship These strategies can broadly be conceptualized as aimed at two goals. First, reduce polarization in society at large by encouraging systematic evaluation of information in general. When it is easier for people to evaluate information systematically, they tend to rely less on partisanship as a heuristic. For example, partisan identity does not tend to strengthen when people are invited to consider substantive policy information. Thinking about policy tends to shrink polarization (Brader & Tucker, 2018). When people have more motivation to systematically examine information because of an incentive, or because of personal relevance of the outcome, they are better able to discern truthful information (e.g., Pennycook et al., 2020), and may be less reliant on partisanship. People also think more systematically when presented with a negative/difficult scenario (e.g., a bad economy), and when their social networks are heterogeneous (Krishna & Sokolova, 2017). However, evidence indicates that reliance on this first strategy may be insufficient to reduce polarization and in fact may backfire (Kahan et al., 2012). A second strategy is to focus efforts on motivating the least worried group, tailoring the approach by identifying characteristics or subgroups most receptive to intervention. Such an approach requires recruitment of trusted in-group leaders to communicate scientific information, and importantly to communicate that the reliance on this information is no threat by connecting the information with culturally congruent values (Kahan et al., 2012). In support of this strategy, we contend that examining within-party variation in response to information about the pandemic may be a helpful strategy. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 In sum, it is clear that opposing partisans evaluate scientific evidence differently, on relatively apolitical topics like the development of young adults (Fountain et al., 2021), and certainly on politicized subjects such as climate change (Kahan et al., 2012), and immigration (Savadori et al., 2020) . Thus, these differences likely hold true for naturalistic information on the COVID pandemic, given the large amount of uncertainty that tends to exacerbate polarization (van Baar et al., 2021), the complex decision-making required to evaluate risk of infection, ongoing and developing understanding of the nature of COVID, and the politicization of this information. Thus, we hypothesize that partisanship will be a useful tool for many people to shape their attitudes and starkly visible in responses to the COVID pandemic. Specifically, we hypothesize that identification with a political party is associated with divergent responses to changes in objective data about the COVID pandemic. Secondly, we explore the relationship of individual factors to these partisan responses, offering an analysis of large-scale data to complement the literature’s experimental (small N) focus. Results: Data We use regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between individual characteristics, including political party affiliation, and attitudes toward COVID. To evaluate the correlation between new COVID cases in a state and the response in attitudes (worry), we combined several data sources. The first main source of data is the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) COVID-19 Data Repository, collected and maintained by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at JHU (Dong et al., 2020). In order to represent the intensity of infection rates in states with widely varying populations, we calculate the number of new cases in the state each month, divide by the population of the state (Dong et al., 2020)(Census 2021a), multiply by 100,000, and use the resulting variable in our analysis: new cases per 100k. The second primary data source, which provides the demographic and attitude data, is the Gallup COVID-19 Survey (Gallup 2021). We use surveys from April 2020 through November 2021. We match Gallup survey respondents to the state-month measure of new COVID-19 cases. We consider individuals’ responses to the COVID pandemic with respect to their self-reported worry. The Gallup poll asks respondents “How worried are you that you will get the coronavirus (COVID-19)?” The possible answers range from not worried at all, not too worried, somewhat worried, and very worried (Gallup 2021). We combine the answers of somewhat worried and very worried into a binary measure that indicates worry about contracting COVID-19. In Figure 1, we present case data and worry level. We report the summary of the average number of new cases per 100,000 residents in a particular state in a given month in the bars, and worry levels by political party affiliation of the respondent. Figure 1 shows a clear progression of COVID infections in the US from April 2020 through November 2021. Evident are the dramatic rise in cases in the fall and winter of 2020, the decline following widescale vaccination in the spring of 2021, followed by the rise in cases in summer 2021 due to the Delta variant. For the entirety of the sample period, Democrats’ worry exceeds Republicans’ and those reporting independent/other party affiliation. For ease of discussion, we refer to those of independent or other party affiliation as “Independents” for the remainder of this article. The difference between Democrats and Republicans is frequently in excess of 30 percentage points, which is particularly Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 remarkable given that the percent of Republicans who report this worry is nearly always below 30%. Independents sit between Democrats and Republicans. In addition to these clear party differences, we see the progression of attitudes toward COVID across the months of the pandemic. There is a decline in worry during the [short and sweet] weeks in early summer 2021 when those who desired were fully vaccinated and Delta had not yet found a foothold the US, and a subsequent rise as Delta infections rose. The stark differences in worry are suggestive of partisanship and polarization about COVID. In light of this, we consider education the best available measure of participants' tendency toward systematic evaluation, and examine how education augments or diminishes the partisan divide. We divided the sample into three groups by educational attainment: those who completed high school and no more, those who had some college or a certification, and those who completed a 4-year college degree or higher. In Figure 2, we show that education does not erase this difference by political party. All education levels of Democrats are everywhere more worried than all education levels of Republicans and Independents. Taken together, our descriptive analyses by party-- including groupings for education-- show that the most important determinant of worry is party affiliation. Consistent with much of the reporting and prior work on attitudes toward COVID, Democrats are more worried than Republicans. Demographic Variation In Table 1, we provide demographic characteristics for the full sample, as well as subsamples determined by the individual’s self-reported political party. As observed in the charts, Democrats are more likely to be worried about COVID than Republicans, and Independents fall between the two. There are more males among Republicans (53%) than Democrats (39%) in our sample, and the average age of Republicans (55.7 years) exceeds that of Democrats (48.5 years). Educational attainment differs across the two main parties as well – Democrats are much more likely to have a 4-year college degree or higher (45.9% compared to 16.8% among Republicans), while Republicans are much more likely to stop formal education after graduating high school (70.2%, versus 41.1% of Democrats). Likely related, Democrats report higher incomes on average, though this is mostly driven by the top of the distribution. According to Census data, median income in the US in 2020 was $67,521, and median earnings from working were $41,535 (Shrider, et al. 2021). Among Democrats, 61.75% earn $60,000 or more, while the corresponding number for Republicans is a nearly-identical 61.01%. In contrast, 27% of Democrats earn more than $120,000 per year, while 21.64% of Republicans do. There are differences in partnerships as well: 79% of Republicans report being married or partnered, while 66% of Democrats report the same. Las, there are large differences in racial makeup between the two parties. White individuals comprise 84.5% of Republicans, with 12% Hispanic individuals and 2.5% Black individuals. Among Democrats, white individuals comprise 61.7%, Hispanic individuals 16.9%, and Black individuals 19.7%. In order to control for the fact that more densely populated areas may attract different types of people, or may lead individuals to view their risk differently, we control for the size of the Census- defined metropolitan areas using a categorical variable derived from Census estimations of metropolitan populations (Census 2021b). We use more precise delineations than the typical Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 urban/rural split given the specificity available. As seen in Table 1, there are not large differences in metropolitan size between Republicans and Democrats. The differences in socioeconomic characteristics across the two parties could explain some of the differences in attitudes related to COVID. In order to control for these differences, we use regression analysis to isolate the correlation between state COVID cases and worry. Analysis We estimate a linear probability model using ordinary least squares to predict worry about COVID. In order to better understand the relationship between objective external risk of exposure, measured by the new cases in the state, and individual reactions to new cases, we begin with a simple model and build on it by adding measures for individual characteristics. In Table 2, we report results for the full sample. Moving across the table from column set (1) to (3), we augment the model with explanatory variables. The first column (1) includes only new cases and the political affiliation of the respondent, while columns (2) and (3) add socioeconomic controls, and (3) includes state and month-year fixed effects. The stability of the coefficients on both new cases and political party is remarkable. Not only does the sign remain consistent, but the magnitude varies little across estimates, even as a full set of controls is added to the model, up to and including state and month-year fixed effects. The coefficient in the first row indicates that for every new case of COVID per 100,000 residents recorded in a state in a given month-year, the probability that an individual is worried about COVID has a corollary increase of 0.0025 percentage points. While this effect appears small, this indicates that a 1000 case increase per 100,000 correlates with a 2.5 percentage point increase in the probability an individual reports worry over COVID. In other words, higher numbers of new cases correlate with an overall increase in worry. This number has minimal variation as a robust set of controls is added to the model. The differences across political parties are also remarkably stable as new control variables enter the model. Across the models, Democrats are anywhere from 39 to 41 percentage points more likely to report worry about COVID than Republicans, consistent with the earlier figures. Independents are between 18 and 19 percentage points more likely to report being worried about COVID than Republicans. Relative to those with a 2-year college degree or certification, those who at most graduated high school are no more or less worried. However, relative to the same group, those with a 4-year college degree or higher report higher levels of worry, 5 percentage points higher. Males report lower levels of worry (nearly 8 percentage points lower), while those married or partnered report higher levels of worry (by 3 percentage points) With regards to the experience of different racial groups, Hispanic individuals are between 3.5 and 4.1 percentage points more likely to be worried, while Black individuals are 3 to 3.75 percentage points less likely to be worried than white individuals, a result that appears counter to the morbidity risk faced by different racial groups. When considering income, we find that lower income individuals are generally more likely to report Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 being worried about COVID, anywhere from 3 to 8 percentage points more. We find no differences across the size of the metropolitan area of the individual in terms of worry. In Table 3, we separate the three political party groups (Democrats, Republicans, and Independents) into their own models. Because the full sample regressions shed some insight on the correlation between various individual characteristics and COVID attitudes, we examine whether similar relationships exist within each party. Recall that the base percentage of worried individuals differs substantially across parties. From Table 1, 65% of Democrats, 24% of Republicans, and 43% of Independents report being somewhat or very worried about getting COVID. Thus, we expect the coefficient estimates to vary across the three groups. In Table 3, column set (1) includes the results for regressions using Democrats only, (2) for Republicans only, and (3) for Independents only. Across the table, higher numbers of new COVID cases in the individual’s state increase worry, but for Republicans the coefficient is not statistically significant. When we consider education, all three party affiliations display a positive relationship between worry and the highest educational attainment (4-year college degree or higher). The coefficient estimates for Republicans and Independents are twice the size of the coefficient for Democrats. This is at least partly explained by overall higher worry levels across all education levels for Democrats. Among Republicans and Independents, those with a high school degree or less and those with a 2-year college degree or certification do not report different levels of worry. This suggests that 4-year college degrees are the critical cut for different reactions to case levels. The coefficient sizes vary across the regression results shown in the three columns, but the signs are the same for several variables. Overall, males are less worried than females about COVID. The correlation between worry and sex is smallest among Democrats, larger for Republicans, and largest for Independents. Among Democrats and Independents, married or partnered individuals are more worried than single individuals, though among Republicans the difference is tiny and statistically insignificant. The correlations between worry and age differ substantially by party. Among Democrats and to a lesser extent Independents, older individuals are less worried, but among Republicans they are more worried. We also see important differences by race. Black Democrats are less worried than white Democrats, but Hispanic Democrats are more worried than white Democrats. Asian Republicans are more worried about COVID than white Republicans, as are Hispanics, but Black Republicans report similar levels of worry as white Republicans. Among Independents, Hispanic individuals are once again more worried than white individuals. With income, no strong patterns emerge, though those who have incomes below median tend to be more worried than those with median income. Last, when we consider our controls for the size of the metropolitan area, there are no patterns of differences in worry. Within-party differences by educational attainment In Table 4, we add two sets of interaction terms to further distinguish patterns in attitudes. First, and most important in our analysis, we interact the new cases in the state with the education categories within each party. In doing so, we determine whether low and high education individuals respond differently to higher case levels in their state. The second interaction term, discussed below, Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 combines marital status and age categories in order to proxy for the probability that the individual has a child. [1] The first three pairs of rows of results include the coefficients on new cases interacted with the individual’s educational attainment. Using this specification, we can determine whether an educational attainment group’s worry correlates with a change in cases. We can also use post- estimation tests to determine whether the coefficients for the different education categories differ statistically from each other. Results from the postestimation tests appear at the bottom of the table. Among Democrats, more cases correlate with higher reported worry, on the order of 0.027 percentage points per new case per 100,000 for the lowest education group, 0.025 percentage points for the middle education group, and 0.044 percentage points for the highest education group. These effects are not statistically distinguishable from one another overall. Democrats with all levels of education react with more worry when there are higher caseloads in their state, and the difference between the higher coefficient for the most educated compared to the coefficient for high school or less group borders on statistical significance at the 5% level. A different story emerges for Republicans and Independents. Among Republicans, only the highest education group (4-year college degree or higher) has a positive, statistically significant correlation – for each new case per 100,000, there is an associated increase in the probability an individual is worried about COVID of 0.037 percentage points. A puzzling result emerges for the middle education group (2-year college degree or certification), which has a negative correlation. For each new case per 100,000, this group has an associated 0.035 percentage point decline in reported worry. This result is counterintuitive. Among the different education groups in the Republicans estimation, each education group’s coefficient is statistically distinguishable from the others. Among Independents, only the highest education group has a statistically significant coefficient. For each new case per 100,000, there is an associated 0.089 percentage point increase in reported worry, the largest coefficient across models. While the two lowest educational groups do not differ statistically from one another, they both differ from the highest education group. The second set of interaction terms combines our age categories and married/partnered variables. For ease of comparison, we transform the raw estimates into relative differences between married/partnered and single individuals in the same age group, though the raw estimates are available upon request. We report the difference in coefficient sizes to show the relative effect of being partnered within each age group. At the bottom of Table 4 we report the tests of significance for this difference. The results here are puzzling. Among Democrats, the young and partnered are more worried, but among Republicans they are less worried. As we saw in the previous tables, across all parties men are less worried than women, and the size of the metropolitan area does not correlate with worry levels. Another interesting pattern emerges across the race variables for each party’s regression. Across all parties and specifications, Hispanic individuals are more worried about COVID than white individuals. Only Asian Republicans differ from the white individuals in their party, reporting more worry. Black Democrats are less worried than white Democrats, but Black Independents are more worried than white Independents. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 The results for income are generally weak, though there is some evidence that lower income individuals of Independents are more worried about COVID than those at the median and higher. Increasing salience: Using deaths instead of cases One criticism of using case data to evaluate changes in the level of reported worry is that cases are not as salient as deaths from COVID. While case reporting is subject to accuracy concerns (e.g., are all cases reported, is the timing of cases accurate), COVID death data are more difficult to contest. For context, we repeat Figure 1 with new state deaths per 100,000 in Figure 3. Initially, worry does not seem to move with deaths, but the uptick in deaths from the Delta variant in the second half of 2021 is met with higher levels of worry. In order to test whether individuals respond to the prevalence of death from COVID differently from the prevalence of infection, we repeat our analyses from Table 3 and Table 4 above using new monthly deaths from COVID per 100,000 in the state instead of new cases. We report only the results for our new deaths per 100,00, political party, and deaths-education interaction variables in Table 5. In Table 5, we report results from 6 separate estimations. The first set of results reports the coefficient on new COVID deaths per 100,000 in the state for each party affiliation. Only Democrats display a correlation of more deaths with more worry. For each new state death per 100,000, there is an associated 0.073 percentage point increase in reported worry. Note that this is more than 10 times larger than the coefficient we observed with cases. There is no statistically significant correlation for Republicans or Independents. We report the results from the education and deaths interactions for each party in the next set of results. Across parties, the lowest education group does not display different levels of worry with higher deaths. Among Republicans, the middle education group (some college or certification) has a negative coefficient on higher deaths (like the cases model), suggesting these Republicans are less worried when there are higher deaths. Again, this is counterintuitive. Across all three party groupings, we see that the college-educated report higher levels of worry when there are more deaths in their state. For each additional death per 100,000, Democrats have a correlating 0.085 percentage point increase in worry, Republicans have a 0.19 percentage point increase in worry, and Independents have a 0.227 percentage point increase in worry. This suggests that the most educated members of each party display different patterns of behavior than the others in their party. Note, again, that the coefficients on deaths per 100,000 are much larger than those on cases per 100,000. This may be due in part to the different magnitude of cases versus deaths. Discussion Many earlier papers focus on party differences in attitudes, and our study supports the finding that party affiliation is often the most important individual attribute for predicting such things. One way our study illuminates a different aspect is in our focus on worry as a private response, distinct from behaviors that might threaten in-group membership. Secondly, in including the education and COVID-prevalence interaction terms we use objective data as opposed to media exposure. Partisan divisions influenced the way Republicans and Democrats responded to information about the pandemic, with Republicans being less worried about COVID. Consistent with the literature, Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 Republicans hold attitudes that are consistent with being “less willing to support policies to mitigate the threat of the virus” (Druckman et al., 2021, p. 35). The educational variation in our data is surprising and suggests potential for successful public health intervention within conservative circles. We find that higher educated individuals respond differently – with more worry – to higher case and death numbers across parties. The effects are strongest for the highest education group (college degree or higher). While the rhetoric led us to expect no difference among Republicans by education, we find an important distinction. While lower education Republicans do not change their attitudes around COVID as prevalence in their state rises, the highest-educated Republicans report more worry in the context of higher case and death numbers. One possible explanation for this result is that an individual’s ability to process numerical data and complex cognition tends to increase systematic reasoning (Krishna & Sokolova, 2017). This is new evidence on the moderating influence of education, as earlier work expects education to exacerbate party differences (Kahan et al., 2012); Savadori et al., 2020). Another aspect striking result is the high levels of worry about COVID among Democrats. Across all months of our data, we see much higher levels of worry among Democrats than the other two groups. This leads to philosophical questions. Are Democrats too worried about the risk, are Republicans too unworried about the risk, or is there a happy medium? Last, these findings suggest a new direction for public health interventions. If the goal is to motivate health behavior change, then strategies tailored for Republican audiences may be most effective. This has two clear implications. First, we find strong evidence that the public health messaging should take into account educational attainment among Republicans, and weaker evidence to do so for Independents and Democrats. Given the different correlations between new cases (and deaths) and self-reported worry measures, this is not a one-size-fits-all setting. Second, it may be more effective to mobilize in-group members who respond to higher COVID prevalence with more worry (the most educated Republicans) to help influence lower education groups to update their beliefs about the pandemic than to continue with untargeted public health recommendations. Conclusion As the pandemic remains at the forefront of countries’ attention, our study provides evidence that could help shape messaging and policy. Seeing these trends, particularly among Republicans, is instructive for both federal and local governments. Given that higher educated Republicans react to more cases with more worry, inclusive messaging that focuses on the measured response to higher case levels could help to ameliorate the sharp party divide that pervades news reports. Findings in behavioral economics surrounding norms and their influence on behavior suggest a change in the public messaging about how trusted conservative individuals respond to higher case numbers could further influence others toward more cautious behavior. Further, public service announcements aimed at improving numeracy could also help close the gap between the education groups across party affiliations, though this approach would need to be stratified to account for educational and ideological differences. Our results provide motivation for future work to clarify the role of education in polarization and interpretation of scientific information. Our results oppose the experimental results of Kahan et al., 2012, that education moves Republicans toward public health recommendations. Does education have this moderating influence in real-life settings as we find, or does education exacerbate Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 differences as others suggest? Or, is the answer more complex? Additional work, in the context of the pandemic and more broadly, could help to clarify the role of education in the partisan divide. Methods: Data: The first main source of data is the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) COVID-19 Data Repository, collected and maintained by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at JHU. The repository holds extensive data on COVID-19 infection rates by state and local geographical units, as well as national estimates, in addition to death counts and more (Dong et al., 2020). We downloaded the case and death database by week at the county-state level of observation, and converted the data to calculate the new cases in the state each month. We transform the data in this way to capture the changing landscape of COVID-19 threat over the months of the pandemic. In order to represent the intensity of infection rates in states with widely varying populations, we divide the new cases variable by the population of the state, from the Census Bureau, and multiply by 100,000, and use the resulting variable in our analysis (new cases per 100k) (Census 2021a). We repeat the process to calculate new deaths per 100,000 in each state in each month. The second primary data source, which provides the demographic data and the attitude data, is the Gallup COVID-19 Survey. Beginning in March 2020 and still running currently, Gallup polls U.S. residents on many aspects of life during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Gallup includes some measures in limited time frames, others span most of the data collection period. Due to our variables of interest and the current release of data, we focus on observations from April 2020 through November 2021, which contain valid answers for our variables of interest. According to Gallup’s documentation Results for this Gallup poll are based on self-administered web surveys conducted April 2020 to November 2021, with a random sample of 143,884 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, who are members of the Gallup Panel. Of the total adults surveyed, 121,208 were in one of the 50 U.S. states, with valid data for all of the variables used in the analysis, and are included in this analysis. The survey was conducted in English. Individuals without Internet access were not covered by this study. The Gallup Panel is a probability-based panel of U.S. adults who Gallup selects using address-based sampling methods and random-digit-dial phone interviews that cover landline and cellphones. Gallup weighted the obtained samples to correct for nonresponse. Nonresponse adjustments were made by adjusting the sample to match the national demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education and region. Demographic weighting targets were based on the most recent Current Population Survey figures for the aged 18 and older U.S. population. The survey achieved a response rate of 46%. [The response rate for any given sample in 2020 was between 42% and 51%, and for any given sample in 2021 is between 27% and 36%]. Respondents receive a small post-paid incentive of $1 incentive for completing the survey… In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls (Gallup 2021, p. 7). Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 For our education measure, we condense the categories available in the Gallup data down to three. The variable is asked and includes categories as follows. What is the highest level of school you have completed or the highest degree you have received? 1 – Less than a high school diploma (Grades 1 through 11, or no schooling) 2 – High school graduate (Grade 12 with diploma or GED certificate 3 – Technical, trade, vocational, or business school or program after high school 4 – Some college – college, university, or community college – but no degree 5 – Two-year associate degree from a college, university, or community college 6 – Four-year bachelor’s degree from a college or university (e.g., BS, BA, AB) 7 – Some postgraduate or professional schooling after graduating college, but no postgraduate degree (e.g., some graduate school) 8 – Postgraduate or professional degree, including master’s, doctorate, medical, or law degree (e.g., MA, MS, PhD, MD, JD) (Gallup, 2021, p. 26) We created one group with at most a high school degree (values of 1 and 2 in the original variable), one group with some college or training after high school (values 3, 4, and 5 in the original variable), and one group with a college degree or higher (values of 6, 7, and 8 in the original variable). In the Gallup dataset, we are limited to what the survey included. For example, our metro size variable depends on the reported metropolitan area of the respondent. Analysis: In order to estimate the correlation between an individual’s worry over COVID-19 and the prevalence of COVID-19 in the individual’s state, we estimate the following models. We consider two measures of prevalence, new cases per 100,000 in the state, and new deaths per 100,000 in the state. First, we estimate the relationship between worry, and new cases and political affiliation (Equation 1a). We then add individual and community characteristics (Equation 1b). Our full model includes the individual and community characteristics, as well as state and month-year fixed effects. Equation 1a: 𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑦!\"# = \t 𝛽$ + 𝛽%𝑁𝑒𝑤𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠\"# + 𝛽&𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑦!\"# Equation 1b: 𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑦!\"# = \t 𝛽$ + 𝛽%𝑁𝑒𝑤𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠\"# + 𝛽&𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑦!\"# + 𝛽'𝐸𝑑𝑢!\"# + 𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑜𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛!\"#Γ + 𝜖!\"# Equation 1c: 𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑦!\"# = \t 𝛽$ + 𝛽%𝑁𝑒𝑤𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠\"# + 𝛽&𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑦!\"# + 𝛽'𝐸𝑑𝑢!\"# + 𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑜𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛!\"#Γ + 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒\" + 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ# + 𝜖!\"# where, for individual i in state j in month-year t: 𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑦!\"# = 1 if the respondent is worried or very worried about contracting COVID-19 𝑁𝑒𝑤𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠\"# = the number of new cases of COVID-19 per 100,00 state residents in state j in month-year t Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176530 𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑦!\"# = the political party affiliation of the respondent 𝐸𝑑𝑢!\"# = the educational attainment group of the respondent 𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑜𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛!\"# = a vector of socioeconomic characteristics, including measures for gender, marital/partner status, age, race, income, and the population of the metropolitan area 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒\" = a state fixed effect 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ# = a month-year fixed effect, and 𝜖!\"# is a stochastic error term We estimate Equations 1a, 1b, and 1c for the full sample, as reported in Table 2. We estimate Equation 1c separately for the three political affiliation groups (Democrat, Republican, and Independent), dropping the political affiliation variable. These results are in Table 3. Equation 2: 𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑦!\"# = \t 𝛽$ + 𝛽(𝑁𝑒𝑤𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠!\"# ∗ 𝐸𝑑𝑢!\"# \t + 𝛽)𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑!\"# ∗ 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑔!\"# + 𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑜𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛!\"#Γ + 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒\" + 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ# + 𝜖!\"# where, in addition to the variables specified above, 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑!\"#= 1 if the respondent is married or partnered 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑔!\"#= is the age category for the respondent, either 18-24 years, 25-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-64 years, 65-74 years, or 75+ years old In Equation 2, we interact the number of cases with educational attainment to examine whether different levels of educational attainment respond to new cases differently. We also interact the indicator for whether the individual is married/partnered with the age categories to proxy for the probability an individual is a parent. We estimate Equation 2 separately for the three party affiliations. These results are in Table 4. We repeat the estimation of the model specified by Equation 2, separately by political affiliation, substituting new COVID deaths per 100,000 in the state for the new cases variable. We report a subset of results from these estimations in Table 5. Together, these models help us explore the relationship between individual characteristics, COVID- 19 prevalence in a state, and attitudes toward COVID-19. [1] In some waves of this survey, Gallup collected data on whether there were children in the household. In order to check whether our proxy of the age-married interaction term accurately predicted who had children, we compared the two measures for the waves we had full information. While imperfect, those who are partnered and of child-bearing years are more likely to have children than those who are not partnered. In a regression predicting who had children for the waves which include that information, those who are partnered and of child-bearing years are substantially more likely to have children than those unpartnered in the same age group.
