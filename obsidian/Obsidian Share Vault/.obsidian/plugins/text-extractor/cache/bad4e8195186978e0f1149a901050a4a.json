From the perspective of social choice theory, ranked-choice vot- ing (RCV) is known to have many ﬂaws. RCV can fail to elect a Condorcet winner and is susceptible to monotonicity paradoxes and the spoiler eﬀect, for example. We use a database of 182 American ranked-choice elections for polit- ical oﬃce from the years 2004-2022 to investigate empirically how frequently RCV’s deﬁciencies manifest in practice. Our general ﬁnding is that RCV’s weaknesses are rarely observed in real-world elections, with the exception that ballot exhaustion frequently causes majoritarian failures. 1. Introduction The use of ranked-choice voting (RCV) has greatly increased in the United States during the last few years. New York City ﬁrst used RCV for city primary elections in 2021, the state of Maine has used it for state primary elections and elections for federal oﬃce since 2018, and the state of Alaska implemented RCV for federal and state oﬃces in 2022. The voting method is well-known to have many deﬁciencies which receive attention in the social choice literature. The deﬁciencies with which we are concerned are: • RCV can fail to elect the Condorcet winner. • RCV is susceptible to the spoiler eﬀect. • RCV is susceptible to downward and upward monotonicity paradoxes. • RCV is susceptible to the truncation paradox, the most extreme version of which is the no-show paradox. • RCV is susceptible to compromise strategic voting. • RCV is not truly “majoritarian” because of ballot exhaustion. The purpose of this article is to examine how often these issues occur in actual elections, where we focus on the single-winner case. To that end, we collected the ballot data for as many single-winner ranked-choice American political elections as we could, resulting in a database of 182 elections. The ﬂaws of RCV listed above can manifest only in elections without a majority candidate (i.e., elections in which RCV goes to at least a second round), and thus our database consists only of such elections. Our general ﬁnding is that these ﬂaws occur rarely in actual ranked-choice elections, except for majoritarian failures caused by ballot exhaustion. While much of our analysis is new, perhaps the primary value of this article is that we provide a complete analysis of “problematic” American RCV elections, summarizing much of the empirical research of the last 18 years. AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 2 Num. Voters AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 3 The method of RCV declares a winner as follows: if the election contains a majority candidate, a candidate who receives a majority of ﬁrst-place votes, then that candidate is declared the winner. Otherwise eliminate the candidate(s) with the fewest ﬁrst-place votes and transfer that candidate’s votes to other candidates based on the second-place choices on that eliminated candidate’s ballots. If a surviving candidate now has a majority of the remaining votes, that candidate wins; otherwise, the process of elimination and vote-transfer continues in this manner until a candidate has secured a majority of (ﬁrst-place and transferred) votes. We illustrate the RCV algorithm using the preference proﬁle in Table 1. Begich receives 53810 ﬁrst-place votes, Palin receives 58974, and Peltola receives 75799, and thus Begich is eliminated. As a result, 27070 of his votes are transferred to Palin, 15478 are transferred to Peltola, and 11262 are dropped from the election (these ballots are said to be exhausted ). After the vote transfer, Peltola wins the election with 91277 votes to Palin’s 86044. If an election contains more than three candidates then RCV proceeds similarly, but the process may take more rounds to select a winner. We now deﬁne the ﬂaws of RCV that we investigate in this article. Condorcet Failure: In the Alaska House election, if we compare Begich to Palin in a head-to-head matchup then 101229 voters prefer Begich to Palin whereas 63621 voters prefer Palin to Begich. Similarly, 93052 voters prefer Begich to Peltola whereas 79558 voters prefer Peltola to Begich. Based on the ranking information provided by the voters3, Begich wins each of his head-to-head matchups and thus is the Condorcet winner of the election. Condorcet winners receive much attention in the social choice literature because they are considered “consensus” or “strong” candidates, candidates who “should” win (assuming the election contains such a candidate). We say that an RCV election demonstrates a Condorcet failure when the election contains a Condorcet winner and RCV fails to select this candidate, which occurs in the Alaska House election. Spoiler Eﬀect: An RCV election demonstrates the spoiler eﬀect if there exists a subset of losing candidates such that removing these candidates from the election causes the winner of the election to change. In the Alaska House election, if the losing candidate Palin were removed then Begich would win, and thus this election demonstrates a spoiler eﬀect under RCV. Upward Monotonicity Paradox: An RCV election demonstrates an upward monotonicity paradox if there exists a set of ballots such that shifting the RCV winner up the rankings on those ballots but keeping the relative rankings of the other candidates the same, thereby creating a hypothetical second preference proﬁle in which the winner has more voter support, creates an election in which the original RCV winner does not win. In the Alaska House election, if 6000 ballots on which Palin is ranked ﬁrst and no other candidate is ranked on the ballot were changed to ballots of the form Peltola > Palin then Peltola would lose the resulting election. That is, giving the winning candidate Peltola more ﬁrst place votes by shifting her up the rankings on some ballots turns her into a loser. The reason is that even though Peltola picks up an additional 6000 ﬁrst-place votes in the hypothetical second election, this additional support causes Palin to be eliminated from the AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 4 Num.Voters AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 5 Peltola head-to-head in the ﬁnal round. These 5400 voters would have achieved a more desirable outcome (their second-favorite candidate would have won instead of their third favorite) if they had abstained. Compromise Voting Failure: Compromise voting is a form of strategic voting in which some voters calculate that their favorite candidate cannot win and so insincerely rank another candidate as their ﬁrst choice. This plays out regularly in plurality elections, where voters often cast a vote for a candidate perceived as viable instead of voting for their favorite. Generalizing the deﬁnition from (Green- Armytage, 2014), we say that an election demonstrates a compromise voting failure if there exists a losing candidate A and a set of ballots such that A is ranked above the original RCV winner, and A becomes the RCV winner if we shift them up to the ﬁrst ranking on these ballots. That is, this failure occurs if there exists a set of voters who should have cast a “compromise vote” for A, thereby causing A to win. The deﬁnition in (Green-Armytage, 2014) is much more restrictive: they consider only elections in which shifting A to the top of all ballots on which A is ranked over the original RCV winner turns A into the winner. The Alaska election in Table 1 demonstrates this failure: if 5400 voters who ranked Palin ﬁrst and Begich second had ranked Begich ﬁrst instead then Begich would have won the election and these voters would have obtained their second choice instead of their third. To obtain a more desirable electoral outcome, these voters should have “compromised” for Begich. This election also ﬁts the more restrictive deﬁnition from (Green-Armytage, 2014), as Begich would become the winner if all 34078 voters who cast the ballot Palin > Begich > Peltola were to rank Begich ﬁrst. Majoritarian Failure: We say that an election demonstrates a majoritarian failure if, when the RCV algorithm is run until there are only two candidates left, the winning candidate in this ﬁnal round does not achieve a majority of the total number of votes cast. Both the Alaska and San Francisco elections demonstrate this failure. Table 1 shows a total of 188583 voters in that election (which increases slightly if we were to include write-in candidates), yet the winner Peltola earns 91277 in the ﬁnal round, achieving only 48.4% of the votes of the total electorate. Similarly, in the San Francisco election there were 39322 ballots cast and the winner Melgar earns 18561/39322 = 47.2% of the total vote in the ﬁnal round. The reason these winners fail to earn a majority is ballot exhaustion (Burnett and Kogan, 2015), where many partial ballots are discarded before the ﬁnal round because these ballots do not rank either of the two ﬁnal candidates. We use the term winner’s vote share to refer to the percentage of the total votes earned by the RCV winner in the ﬁnal round when there are only two candidates remaining, so that Melgar’s vote share is 47.2%, for example. 3. Data Sources and Collection We collected the vote data for as many American single-winner ranked-choice political elections as we could, with the restriction that we obtained data only for elections in which no candidate earns an initial majority of ﬁrst-place votes. In total our database contains 182 elections, 147 of which were collected by the ﬁrst author for (McCune & McCune, 2022a). Most of the elections are for municipal oﬃce such as mayor or city councilor; a handful of elections are for statewide or federal elections, such as elections for US House and Senate in Maine. The data AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 6 Jurisdiction AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 7 election, and (Song, 2022) analyzed many4 of the pre-2021 elections in our database for Condorcet failures. RCV advocacy groups such as FairVote also check ranked- choice data for Condorcet failures (Landsman 2017; Otis 2021). There is a small literature about Condorcet failures which investigates elections outside the context of American political elections. For example, (Regenwetter et al. 2007; Popov et al. 2014) analyse ranked-choice election data from the American Psychological Association, using the data to generate tens of thousands of election pseudoproﬁles. They ﬁnd an extremely low rate of Condorcet failures under RCV. (Darmann et al. 2019) use survey data collected prior to the 2015 parliamentary elections in the Austrian federal state of Styria, and again ﬁnd little evidence of Condorcet failures in the data. Spoiler Eﬀect : Most of the discussion of spoilers has been limited to the theoreti- cal literature, with the exception that many non-academic articles discuss potential spoilers in individual elections. For example, many newspaper articles (for a typ- ical example example, see (Bokat-Lindell, 2021)) mention the famous case of the 2000 US Presidential election in which Ralph Nader is commonly understood to have spoiled the election for Al Gore. (McCune & Wilson, 2022) is the largest empirical study of the spoiler eﬀect in American ranked-choice political elections. The authors ﬁnd two ranked-choice elections demonstrating the spoiler eﬀect out of 170 analyzed, 147 of which are in our database. They also perform bootstrap analysis to generate pseudoproﬁles, similar to the analysis in (Popov et al. 2014), and ﬁnd low rates of the spoiler eﬀect in the generated data. A Condorcet failure is a special case of the spoiler eﬀect as we have deﬁned it, and thus the Condorcet studies mentioned above also indirectly address the spoiler eﬀect. Monotonicity and truncation paradoxes: Most of the elections in our database have not been previously processed by code which searches for monotonicity or truncation paradoxes. The largest empirical study of monotonicity and truncation paradoxes in American political ranked-choice elections occurs in (Graham-Squire & Zayatz, 2021), which analyses elections from Alameda County and San Francisco, CA, as well as a mayoral election from Burlington, VT. The authors ﬁnd a single upward monotonicity paradox and no truncation paradoxes out of 35 elections without a majority candidate. (McCune & Graham-Squire, 2022) analyze 1079 ranked-choice multiwinner elections from Scotland and ﬁnd low (but non-zero) rates of upward monotonicity, downward monotonicity, and no-show paradoxes. Many articles which analyze real-world monotonicity failures focus on single elections. See (Gierzynski et al. 2010; Ornstein & Norman 2014) for an analysis of the 2009 Burlington, VT mayoral election and (McCune & McCune, 2022b) for an analysis of monotonicity failures in a 2021 city council election in Minneapolis, MN. Some prior work is semi-empirical in that the authors use polling or survey data to estimate monotonicity failure rates in real-world elections. For examples of this kind of analysis see (Gallagher, 2013), which studies single-transferable vote elections in Ireland, and (Miller, 2017), which provides a semi-empirical analysis of English general elections from 1992-2010. Compromise voting failures: We are unaware of empirical studies which study this failure. (Green-Armytage, 2014) and (Green-Armytage et al. 2016) analyze compromise voting using a variety of models of voter behavior, and generally ﬁnd AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 8 that RCV is much less susceptible to this issue than other famous voting methods such as plurality and the Borda count. Majoritarian failures: The only empirical studies of majoritarian failures of which we are aware are (Burnett and Kogan, 2015), which analyze four American elections in our database, and (Kilgour et al. 2020), which analyze 18 ranked-choice elections, 4 of which are in our database (the other 14 contain majority candidates or are elections from the UK or the American Psychological Association). FairVote also seems to have done substantial analysis of ballot exhaustion 5, but it is unclear which elections were analyzed. More generally, many studies address the topic of partial ballots without focusing on majoritarian failures per se. (Coll, 2021) and (Donovan et al. 2022) study which demographic groups are more likely to cast partial ballots. (Tomlinson et al., 2022) analyse the eﬀects of ballot truncation on the number of possible winners in ranked- choice elections. 5. Methodology for Detecting RCV Weaknesses in Each Election All elections in the database were processed using Python code which searched for the given ﬂaw. The code is adapted from programs used in (Graham-Squire & Zayatz 2021), (McCune & McCune 2022a), (McCune & Wilson 2022), and (McCune & Graham-Squire 2022). Checking if the RCV winner is the Condorcet winner or if the RCV winner earns a majority of the initial total votes in the ﬁnal round is computationally straightforward. However, there are challenges when searching for the spoiler eﬀect, monotonicity paradoxes, truncation paradoxes, or compromise voting failures. If the number of candidates in an election is large enough then, due to limits of computation time, we cannot check every subset of losing candidates for a change in the winner when this subset is dropped. For example, the 2013 Minneapolis mayoral election contained 35 candidates, resulting in billions of possible sets of candidates to check for the spoiler eﬀect. For all elections in the database we checked for individual spoiler candidates, but for elections with large numbers of candidates we additionally checked only candidate subsets of size two. For elections with more than twelve candidates, we also ran the RCV algorithm until only ten candidates remained and then checked the resulting election for the spoiler eﬀect. Most of the elections were already processed in this manner in (McCune & Wilson, 2022). To demonstrate a monotonicity or truncation paradox, we must ﬁnd a set of ballots such that shifting a candidate up or down the rankings, or truncating the ballots, causes a change in the order of elimination which causes a paradoxical change in the winner. Except for the case of three-candidate elections in which every voter provides a complete ranking, there are no known necessary and suf- ﬁcient conditions for an election to exhibit one of these paradoxes. Thus, if an election exhibits such a paradox, we cannot guarantee our code will ﬁnd it. How- ever, our monotonicity and truncation code has been thoroughly means-tested in other projects and has successfully found many elections which demonstrate mono- tonicity paradoxes. For example, the code found 21 elections demonstrating upward monotonicity paradoxes in Scottish local government elections which had not been previously documented (McCune & Graham-Squire, 2022). The code essentially AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 9 Num.Voters AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 10 Num.Voters AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 11 Num.Voters AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 12 Flaw AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 13 infrequently and, when they do occur, it is not clear that these failures are “action- able” on the part of voters. Issues such as monotonicity paradoxes are undesirable, but they become oﬀensive only in hindsight; we ﬁnd little evidence that voters could vote strategically to engineer such outcomes in actual elections. Our empiri- cal results are consonant with the theoretical work of (Green-Armytage 2014) and (Green-Armytage et al. 2016), which show that RCV is less manipulable than most other voting methods. Majoritarian failures occur at a much higher rate than the other failures, ac- counting for more than half the elections in the database. These occur because a signiﬁcant portion of the electorate in these elections cast partial ballots, causing their ballots to become exhausted before the ﬁnal round. As pointed out in (Bur- nett and Kogan, 2015), partial ballots occur for two reasons. First, voters may voluntarily provide an incomplete ranking, choosing not to rank all candidates. Second, some jurisdictions limit the number of candidates that voters can rank on their ballots. For example, the city of Minneapolis, MN, allows voters to rank only three candidates regardless of the number of candidates in the race. In such elections, voters are often forced to cast partial ballots. For our discussion, it is useful to distinguish between elections in which voters can provide a complete ranking of the candidates if they so choose, and elections in which they cannot. In an election in which the jurisdiction limits the number of candidates ranked on ballots, we say that the election’s truncation level is the number of candidates a voter can rank. If the number of candidates in an election is more than the election’s truncation level plus one, we say the election is truncated because voters cannot provide a complete ranking of the candidates. For example, a ranked-choice election in Minneapolis with ﬁve or more candidates is truncated; if an election contains four or fewer candidates, voters can provide a complete ranking6. In our database 72 elections are truncated and 110 are not. Because voters are forced to cast partial ballots in truncated elections and a majoritarian failure is caused by a signiﬁcant portion of ballots being partial, we expect these failures to be more common in truncated than non-truncated elec- tions. Our ﬁndings bear this out: 57 of the 72 truncated elections demonstrate a majoritarian failure, while 38 of the 110 non-truncated elections demonstrate this ﬂaw. In elections with a majoritarian failure, the winner’s vote share in truncated elections also tends to be lower (on average, 43.9%) than the winner’s vote share in the non-truncated elections (on average, 47.7%). Table 8 shows the ﬁve elections with the smallest winner vote share among the truncated elections. These vote shares are all signiﬁcantly lower than 40%, quite far from a majority. The 2010 San Francisco Board of Supervisors election in the 10th district is particularly extreme, with the winner earning less than 25% of the total vote. By contrast, Table 9 shows the ﬁve elections with the smallest winner’s vote share among the non-truncated elections. The smallest winner’s vote share among the non-truncated elections is 42.2%; there are 13 truncated elections in which the winner’s vote share is smaller. AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 14 Election AN EXAMINATION OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES, 2004-2022 15 “the majoritarian principle is an axiom of democratic government” and uses this statement (among others) to justify the adoption of RCV. Similarly, (Lavin 2019) states: “[W]e need majority rule in elections—not only as a principle or best practice but as a practical assurance to legitimize outcomes and give elected oﬃcials strong mandates to govern. By requiring winners to earn a majority of votes—if not in ﬁrst choices alone then with backup choices—RCV meets both of these critical needs.” Our results suggest that RCV does not live up to such statements in practice. 8. Conclusion When evaluated based on criteria important to the social choice literature, RCV mostly performs well in practice. In the American ranked-choice political elec- tions in our database, RCV almost always selects the Condorcet winner and avoids the spoiler eﬀect, while also demonstrating practical resistance to strategic voting. Paradoxes which feature prominently in the theoretical literature such as mono- tonicity and no-show paradoxes seem to occur on the order of 0.5-1.1% for real- world elections without a majority candidate, and these failure rates would decrease considerably if we also included ranked-choice elections which do not advance to a second round. The percentage of elections in which the winner does not receive a majority in the ﬁnal round is very high, which should give pause to RCV advocates. Since a perfect voting method seemingly does not exist, choosing a method involves trade-oﬀs. The weaknesses of RCV are mostly not observed in real-world ranked-choice data available in the US. Of course, the failure rates are not zero, and it is reasonable to insist on a method which always chooses the Condorcet winner or is not susceptible to monotonicity paradoxes. We have contributed to the literature by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of the social-choice weaknesses of RCV in the US, but whether RCV’s beneﬁts outweigh its costs is, in our view, still an open question.
