You said that the supply curve has price on the y-axis and that the inverse supply curve \"flips the relationship” and that is shows price on the y-axis. Thisis a contradiction. Showdrafts v o) * You're absolutely right, | apologize for the confusion. There was a mistake in my previous explanation. Here's the corrected explanation: * Regular Supply Curve: This depicts a positive relationship between price and quantity. Both price and quantity are typically shown as follows: o Price (P) on the y-axis © Quantity Supplied (Q) on the x-axis Inverse Supply Curve: This is the \"flipped\"” version. It shows price as a function of quantity supplied, essentially reversing the axes. Here's the correct representation: © Quantity Supplied (Q) on the y-axis o Price (P) on the x-axis The key point is that the inverse supply curve shows how the price increases as the quantity supplied increases (moving up on the y-axis). This reflects the rising costs incurred by producers to meet higher electricity demand. | apologize for the inaccuracy in the previous explanation. B g ®= < G","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
