Høga aDepartment of Mathematical Sciences, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7G, 9220, Aalborg Øst, Denmark bNeas Energy A/S, Skelagervej 1, 9000, Aalborg, Denmark Abstract This paper examines the dependence between wind power production and electricity prices and discusses its implica- tions for the pricing and the risk distributions associated with contracts that are exposed to joint price and volumetric risk. We propose a copula model for the joint behavior of prices and wind power production, which is estimated to data from the Danish power market. We ﬁnd that the marginal behavior of the individual variables is best described by ARMA–GARCH models with non-Gaussian error distributions, and the preferred copula model is a time-varying Gaussian copula. As an application of our joint model, we consider the case of an energy trading company enter- ing into longer-term agreements with wind power producers, where the ﬂuctuating future wind power production is bought at a predetermined ﬁxed price. We ﬁnd that assuming independence between prices and wind power produc- tion leads to an underestimation of risk, as the proﬁt distribution becomes left-skewed when the negative dependence that we ﬁnd in the data is accounted for. By performing a simple static hedge in the forward market, we show that the risk can be signiﬁcantly reduced. Furthermore, an out-of-sample study shows that the choice of copula inﬂuences the price of correlation risk, and that time-varying copulas are superior to the constant ones when comparing actual proﬁts generated with diﬀerent models.

Introduction Since the European electricity market reforms in the late 1990’s, the electricity markets have undergone con- siderable structural changes. Liberalization has led to extremely volatile electricity prices, and the prioritization of renewable energy sources in order to reduce CO2 emissions has introduced further challenges in terms of ﬁnancial risk management. One particular challenge that we study in this paper is related to the production uncertainty associated with wind power generation. Wind power is highly non-dispatchable and therefore fundamentally diﬀerent from the more traditional thermal power sources in the sense that the production cannot be planned and controlled to the same extent. The dependency on weather variations (wind speed and air density among others) makes the exact future pro- duction of a wind turbine or wind-farm very hard to predict. Thus, in addition to facing price volatility, wind power generators are exposed to production uncertainty, often referred to as volumetric risk. The joint exposure to price and volumetric risk can be further ampliﬁed by a high penetration ratio of wind power in the grid. This is due to the mechanism of day-ahead price formation, which is based on ﬁnding the equilibrium between supply and demand bids made to the exchange, where the supply curve is built according to merit order stack 1. Because wind power has a very low marginal cost, a high production for a given hour will, other things being ∗Corresponding author Email addresses: anca@math.aau.dk (A.

Preprint submitted to Elsevier December 8, 2016ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT equal, pull the market clearing price downwards. Similarly, if wind power production is low for a given hour, demand will have to be met by either import or turning on more costly generating plants. The latter (and possibly the former) will, again other things being equal, pull the prices upward. This leads to prices and wind power production being negatively correlated, which depending on the strength of this correlation, enhances the joint price and volumetric risk signiﬁcantly. Empirical evidence regarding this relation between spot electricity prices and wind power production has been demonstrated in the literature, e.g. J´onnson et al. (2010) for the Danish power market, Gelabert et al. (2011) for Spain, and Elberg and Hagspiel (2015) and Paraschiv et al. (2014) for Germany. In practice, it is usually energy trading companies that act on the exchange on behalf of the producers. Due to increasing wind power production in some power markets, some trading companies oﬀer, in addition to the man- agement of production, a predetermined ﬁxed price in exchange for the ﬂuctuating production. Companies oﬀering such insurances against price movements will naturally attempt to cover their exposure, and a typical solution that will eliminate some of the risk is to sell energy on the forward market corresponding to the expected wind power production. The remaining exposure will inevitably cause the energy trading companies to purchase energy on the spot market when being short, and dispose of excess energy on the spot market when expecting less than the realized production. Furthermore, the negative relationship between prices and wind power production adds an additional correlation risk: If being short, chances are that the missing energy will have to be bought at a higher price; similarly, if having to dispose of excess electricity, chances are that this will be sold at times of a lower price. As a result, the negative dependence between price and production introduces a “double” risk that is not straight forward to address or diminish without having a well-speciﬁed model for the dependence structure. The problem of joint price and volumetric risk stems back some decades, and was ﬁrst discussed in McKinnon (1967) in relation to the classical farmer’s problem – who faces both price and production uncertainty at the time of harvest. In McKinnon (1967), the author considered futures as hedging instruments, and presented an explicit formula for the optimal position in futures contracts (from a minimum-variance perspective); this formula pointed out that the correlation between the two sources of uncertainty is an essential feature of the problem. Later, the work of Moschini and Lapan (1995) included options in the hedging portfolio due to the non-linearity of proﬁt. More recently, energy related work on the subject became available, and some interesting discussions on the hedging of volumetric risk associated with consumers’ load (demand-side risk) were presented in Oum and Oren (2010, 2009) and Coulon et al. (2013). In Oum and Oren (2010, 2009), the authors assumed bivariate lognormality for electricity prices and consumers’ demand of electricity with a constant correlation, and focused on hedging strategies that 1) maximize the expected utility of the hedged proﬁt and 2) maximize the expected proﬁt subject to a Value-at-Risk constraint. In Coulon et al. (2013), the authors propose a structural model that captures the complex dependence structure of electricity price and load dynamics as a base for hedging. While many of the ideas in the existing literature regarding the hedging of volumetric risk can be used in our application, there are some major distinctions between supply-side volumetric risk (associated with wind power production) and demand-side volumetric risk (consumers’ load) that pose some challenges when having to specify a joint model for day-ahead electricity prices and wind power production. One issue of concern when considering a joint model for electricity prices and wind power production is that the price dynamics are very diﬀerent from the production dynamics, causing us to expect the benchmark bivariate (log) normality assumption to be too restrictive;2 in fact, the two variables might have univariate marginal distributions from diﬀerent families, making it very challenging to decide upon a suitable bivariate density. The assumption of con- stant correlation might also prove too restrictive, and many studies have shown evidence of time-varying dependence between economic time series, see e.g. Avdulaj and Barunikl (2015), De Lira Salvatierra and Patton (2013), Dias and Embrechts (2004), Patton (2006), and Wen et al. (2012). Thus, before addressing issues such as the valuation of correlation risk in the context of ﬁxed price obligations with ﬂuctuating wind power production or the hedging of portfolios containing such obligations, a large part of this paper is concerned with developing a joint model that cor- rectly characterizes the marginal behavior of electricity prices and wind power production and also their dependence structure. For this purpose, we propose the use of copula models. Copulas are ﬂexible tools that can be used to completely describe the dependence structure between random variables while allowing for arbitrary marginal distributions. They were introduced in the literature by Sklar (1959), and have found various applications in economics and ﬁnance over the past decades: See Cherubini and Luciano 2Alone the fact that electricity prices can go negative rules out the lognormality assumption in some marketplaces. 2ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT (2002) for the use of copulas in pricing diﬀerent types of bivariate options, Embrechts et al. (1999) for an application to risk management, and Patton (2013) for a thorough review on copula-based models, including methods for estimation, inference and model-selection. Applications of copula models in energy markets are less common, but some examples are Alexander (2004), Benth and Kettler (2011), Elberg and Hagspiel (2015), and Gonz´alez-Pedraz et al. (2015). Speciﬁcally, we oﬀer two contributions: Firstly, we propose a ﬂexible joint model that relaxes the assumption of bivariate normality and that accounts for the time variation we observe in the dependence structure. Our empirical study is based on data from the Danish power market; nonetheless, we expect our results to be generally applicable in all liberalized energy markets with a high penetration of wind power in the grid. By performing statistical tests and Monte Carlo simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed empirical model captures the joint distribution accurately, and also its time-varying behavior. Secondly, we provide applications of our model that are of interest to e.g. an energy trading company managing a large share of wind turbines. We estimate the risk distribution and the price of correlation risk associated with a speciﬁc contract exposed to joint price and volumetric risk, i.e. a contract implying that an energy trading company oﬀers wind power producers an insurance against price movements, by purchasing their ﬂuctuating production at a predetermined ﬁxed price. We show that the negative relation between prices and wind power production plays an important role both in relation to the pricing and the risk distribution of such contracts. We ﬁnd that the price of correlation risk amounts to a signiﬁcant percentage of the price of a regular ﬁxed price agreement with no volumetric risk (a standard forward contract). Also, the risk distribution becomes left-skewed under the assumption of negative dependence compared to the case of independence. Lastly, we compare the out-of-sample performance of competing models, and show that time-varying copula models outperform the constant copula models. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 brieﬂy introduces the notion of copula and the methodology used in building a joint model for electricity prices and wind power production. In Section 3, we apply the theory to data from the Danish power market. In Section 4, we present a simulation study and investigate how diﬀerent wind scenarios aﬀect the conditional distribution of spot electricity prices. Section 5 presents an application to pricing and risk management, and in Section 6 we conclude. 2. Modeling dependence with copula models Formally, a d-dimensional copula is a distribution function C(u1, . . . , ud) deﬁned on the unit cube [0, 1]d with uniform margins. Since our application is a bivariate one, we shall consider the case where d = 2, however copula theory holds for the general multivariate case. The central result when working with copula models is Sklar’s theorem, which shows how to decompose a joint distribution function into its univariate marginal distribution functions and a copula. In our application, we wish to condition on the information generated by past observations of our variables, de- noted by Ft−1. Thus, we shall consider an extension to Sklar’s theorem proposed in Patton (2006), which holds for conditional joint distributions. The theorem states that if we let F(· | Ft−1) be the bivariate conditional distribu- tion function of the random vector Yt ≡ (Y1,t, Y2,t)′, with conditional marginal distribution functions F1(· | Ft−1) and F2(· | Ft−1), then there exists a two dimensional conditional copula C(· | Ft−1), such that F((y1, y2) | Ft−1) = C(F1(y1 | Ft−1), F2(y2 | Ft−1) | Ft−1). (1) Furthermore, if the marginal distribution functions are continuous, the copula is unique. The converse also holds, such that given two conditional marginal distributions, we can use the conditional copula to link the variables to form a conditional joint distribution with the speciﬁed margins. It is especially this second part of the theorem that is useful here, since it allows us to isolate the description of the dependence structure from the marginal behavior of the individual variables. Moreover, let us deﬁne the probability integral transform variables Ui,t ≡ Fi(Yi,t | Ft−1), for i = 1, 2, (2) and let Ut ≡ (U1,t, U2,t)′. Then Ui,t ∼ Unif(0, 1), and note furthermore that the conditional copula in Eq. (1) is simply the conditional distribution of Ut | Ft−1: Ut | Ft−1 ∼ C(· | Ft−1). (3) 3ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT In this paper, we consider diﬀerent copulas from the elliptical and archimedean families, which are commonly used in the ﬁnancial literature. For a detailed treatment of these copulas and their properties, we refer to the reference books by Joe (1997) and Nelsen (1999). 2.1. Marginal models As a ﬁrst step when working with copulas, we need to ﬁnd proper marginal distribution models. Here, we restrict our attention to marginal models of the ARMA–GARCH type to model the conditional mean and the conditional variance of the individual variables.3 For example, an ARMA(p, q)–GARCH(1, 1) model for the margins can be written as Yi,t = p∑ j=1 φi, jYi,t− j + q∑ k=1 θi,kεi,t−k + εi,t, (4) εi,t = σi,tηi,t, (5) σ2 i,t = ωi + αiε 2 i,t−1 + βiσ 2 i,t−1, (6) for i = 1, 2, where ωi, αi, βi follow the restrictions posed in e.g. Nelson and Cao (1992), and αi + βi < 1. Furthermore, ηi,t | F (i) t−1 ∼ Fi(0, 1), for i = 1, 2 and all t. (7) For the marginal distributions we consider the case where Fi does not vary with time and has a parametric form. Also, we relax the normality assumption, allowing for more general distributions. The ARMA–GARCH models function as ﬁlters that produce innovation processes η1,t and η2,t that are serially independent; it is the conditional distributions of η1,t and η2,t that are then coupled using the conditional copula. One note of caution has to be made regarding the conditioning set Ft−1 emphasizing that this set is generated by (Yt−1, Yt−2, . . . ). In our speciﬁcation for the marginal models however, we do not condition on Ft−1, but only a subset F (i) t−1 ⊂ Ft−1. When using such models, the copula is, according to Fermanian and Wegkamp (2012), a true copula if and only if Yi,t | Ft−1 d = Yi,t | F (i) t−1, (8) for i = 1, 2 and all t. If the equality in Eq. (8) is not satisﬁed, then the joint conditional distribution of Yt | Ft−1 does not have the speciﬁed conditional marginal distributions. To study if the equality in Eq. (8) holds, we test for cross-equation eﬀects by including lags of one variable in the conditional mean equation of the other variable and vice versa, and perform a standard Wald test for the joint signiﬁcance of the added explanatory variables, as proposed in Patton (2013). 2.2. Estimation procedure for the joint model To estimate the joint model, we perform maximum likelihood estimation. The joint conditional density is obtained by diﬀerentiating the joint conditional distribution function in Eq. (1). Thus, the log-likelihood function takes the form log L = T∑ t=1 log f ((y1,t, y2,t) | Ft−1; Θ) = T∑ t=1 log f1(y1,t | Ft−1; Θ1) + T∑ t=1 log f2(y2,t | Ft−1; Θ2) (9) + T∑ t=1 log c((u1,t, u2,t) | Ft−1; γ), 3A variety of other parametric speciﬁcations can be considered for the conditional mean, such as ARMAX models, long memory models, linear and nonlinear regression models, etc. The same holds for the conditional variance where, among others, diﬀerent extensions to the ARCH model can be considered; see Bollerslev (2008) for a long list of such models. 4ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT where f1 and f2 are the conditional marginal densities, c is the conditional copula density deﬁned as c((u1,t, u2,t) | Ft−1) = ∂ 2 ∂u1∂u2 C((u1,t, u2,t) | Ft−1), (10) and ui,t = Fi(yi,t | Ft−1; Θi), for i = 1, 2. (11) In Eq. (9), Θ denotes the set of parameters for the entire model, and Θ1, Θ2 and γ denote the parameters for the two marginal models and the copula, respectively, and have no common elements. For simplicity, we assume that the copula is completely described by one single parameter γ. We perform multi-stage maximum likelihood estimation, where we consider the two marginal models and the copula model separately. For details on the validity of this procedure, consult Patton (2013). 2.3. Time-varying copula models Since the dependency between electricity prices and wind power production might change through time, extending copula models to allow for time-varying dependence is relevant. Before specifying a parametric model for the copula dependence parameter, it is useful to investigate what type of time variation (if any) we can detect in the data. Here, we employ two tests proposed in Patton (2013): One that tests for the presence of a break in the rank correlation by performing the classical “sup” test, and another that tests for the presence of autocorrelation in a measure of dependence. For a comprehensive description of the two tests the reader is referred to Patton (2013). 2.3.1. The Generalized Autoregressive Score model To model time-varying dependence, we employ the Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) model of Creal et al. (2013). In order to ease the presentation, we consider the case where the copula has one dependence parameter. For the GAS(1,1) model, a possible updating equation for the transformed copula dependence parameter gt+1 is: gt+1 = ω + αgt + βI− 1 2 t st, (12) where gt = h(γt), st = ∂ ∂γ log c((u1,t, u2,t); γt), It = Et−1 [s2 t ] . In Eq. (12), st denotes the score of the copula log-likelihood and It is the Fisher information. Moreover, γt denotes the time-varying copula dependence parameter, which is usually constrained to lie in a particular range; see Table A.9 in Appendix A for details regarding the range of diﬀerent copula dependence parameters. For estimation purposes, we apply a transformation h(·) to γt, to obtain gt which takes values on the entire real axis. We note that the updating mechanism given in Eq. (12) is one of many possible speciﬁcations: The GAS model can be extended to include e.g. more lags or exogenous variables. Moreover, the scaling quantity I−1/2 t is simply one convenient choice. GAS models can be generalized to allow for asymmetries or long memory, and to include regime-switching, however such extensions are not considered in the present work. The parameter estimates from the GAS model can be obtained by maximum likelihood estimation, as proposed by Creal et al. (2013). The only challenge can be ﬁnding a closed-form expression for the Fisher information, and thus deriving the updating mechanism in Eq. (12). To overcome this issue, the Fisher information is evaluated numerically for most copula speciﬁcations by performing the following steps: 1. Given a copula speciﬁcation, construct a grid of values for the dependence parameter, [γ(1) < γ(2) < · · · < γ(n)]. 2. For each dependence parameter in the grid, (a) perform a large number of simulations from the chosen copula model, (b) evaluate the score function at each simulation, (c) compute the Fisher information, by taking the mean over the evaluated scores squared. 3. Finally, use linear interpolation to get the Fisher information at intermediate points. 5ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 2.4. Quantile dependence As a preliminary study before specifying copula models, one can examine the dependence in the data by con- sidering quantile dependence. For the case of negatively dependent variables, the quantile dependence is deﬁned as: λ q =    P(U1,t ≤ q | U2,t ≥ 1 − q), 0 < q ≤ 1/2, P(U1,t > q | U2,t < 1 − q), 1/2 < q < 1. (13) By computing quantile dependence coeﬃcients at diﬀerent quantiles q, we obtain a richer description of the depen- dence structure. This can help narrow down the set of possible parametric copulas to a collection of models that are able to capture some of the characteristics we observe in the data. To obtain standard errors for the quantile de- pendence coeﬃcients, we use boostrapping; speciﬁcally, we follow the procedure proposed in Patton (2013), which is based on the stationary block-bootstrap of Politis and Romano (1994), where the optimal block-length is chosen according to Politis and White (2004) and Politis et al. (2009).4 2.5. Selection of copula models To test for whether or not a copula is well speciﬁed, we perform two widely used goodness-of-ﬁt tests (GoF): The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and the Cramer von-Mises (CvM) tests. Under the null that the conditional copula is well speciﬁed, we should ﬁnd that the empirical copula provides a good nonparametric estimate of the null conditional copula. Suppose we have the random sample {ut} = {(u1,t, u2,t)} T t=1 from Ut. Then the test statistics can be written as KS (C) = max t ∣∣∣C(ut; ˆγ) − ˆC(ut) ∣∣∣, (14) CvM(C) = T∑ t=1 { C(ut; ˆγ) − ˆC(ut) }2 , (15) where C(ut; ˆγ) is an estimator of the null conditional copula. Moreover, ˆC denotes the empirical copula deﬁned as ˆC(z) ≡ 1 T + 1 T∑ t=1 1{u1,t ≤ z1, u2,t ≤ z2}, (16) where 1 denotes the indicator function and z = (z1, z2) ∈ [0, 1]2. The KS and CvM tests described above work solely for the testing of constant copula models. A slight modiﬁcation will however allow for the additional testing of time-varying copulas: The KS and CvM tests based on the Rosenblatt transform. In our case, the transformation is simply V1,t = U1,t (17) V2,t = C2|1,t(U2,t|U1,t; ˆγt), (18) where C2|1,t denotes the conditional copula of the random variable U2,t | U1,t. Applying the Rosenblatt transform to the data will yield iid and Unif(0, 1) variables, and hence we can compare the empirical copula of a random sample {vt} = {(v1,t, v2,t)} T t=1 from Vt, against the independence copula, deﬁned as Cindep(vt; ˆγt) ≡ 2∏ i=1 vi,t. (19) A simulation-based approach is used to obtain p-values for the GoF tests described above, since the test statistics in Eqs. (14) and (15) depend on estimated parameters. This approach is described in detail in Berg (2009), Genest et al. (2009) and Patton (2013), and will not be elaborated on here. 4The same bootstrapping procedure can be used to perform inference on other measures of dependence, e.g. linear correlation, rank correlation. 6ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Another very important issue when dealing with copulas is choosing the best copula model among competing models. Here, we consider pairwise comparisons, where we follow Rivers and Vuong (2002) for most in-sample (IS) model comparisons and Diks et al. (2010) for out-of-sample (OOS) model comparisons. The IS comparison test can be performed when the models are non-nested; for the case where the models are nested, a likelihood ratio test can usually be used. The OOS model comparison test works for both nested and non-nested models. Also, both tests can be applied regardless of whether the copula is constant or time-varying. For the IS case, the idea is to compare two models using their joint log-likelihood, and test the null H0 : E [L(1) − L (2)] = 0, (20) against H1 : E [L (1) − L (2)] > 0 and H2 : E [L (1) − L (2)] < 0, (21) where the superscripts (1) and (2) denote two competing models. The case of comparing joint log-likelihoods reduces in our case to comparing copula log-likelihoods, c.f. Eq. (9), since we use the same marginal distribution models. Hence, L (i) = log c(i)(u; γ(i)) or L(i) = log c (i)(u; γ(i) t ), i = 1, 2, depending on whether the copula is constant or time- varying. Rivers and Vuong (2002) show that under the null, √ T ( ¯L(1) − ¯L(2)) √ ˆσ2 d −→ N(0, 1) (22) where ¯L(i) = 1 T T∑ t=1 log c (i) ( ˆut; ˆγ(i) t ) , for i = 1, 2. (23) As an estimator for the asymptotic variance of √T ( ¯L(1) − ¯L(2)) we use the Newey-West heteroskedasticity and auto- covariance consistent (HAC) estimator. For OOS comparisons, we consider a ﬁxed estimation window, where the model is estimated using the data from [1, T ]. We then evaluate the conditional predictive ability of two competing copulas on the OOS period, i.e. on R observations, where R = T ∗ − T , T ∗ > T . The test for comparing the predictive ability of competing copula models conditional on the estimated parameters proposed by Diks et al. (2010) is in fact a special case of the more general framework presented in Giacomini and White (2006). The null hypothesis for the OOS case is the same as for the IS case, and a test statistic based on the diﬀerence between the sample averages of the copula log-likelihoods can again be used, and is shown by Giacomini and White (2006) to be asymptotically N(0, 1) under the null. As an estimator for the asymptotic variance, we use the HAC estimator. 7ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3. Empirical results A joint model for electricity prices and wind power production is interesting to consider in an area with a high penetration ratio of wind power in the grid. Here, we analyze data from Denmark, which has long been among the top wind power producing countries. According to Energinet.dk, the Danish Transmission System Operator, more than a third of the Danish power consumption was covered by wind power in 2013, and in December that year, 57.4% of the consumption came from wind turbines. In 2014, wind turbines produced on average what corresponds to over 39% of the Danish power consumption. Also, in January 2014, 61.7% of the consumption was covered by wind power. Speciﬁcally, we base our analysis on data from one of the two Danish price areas, DK1 (Western Denmark), and a sample period that spans from 01/01/2006 to 31/12/2014. The ﬁrst time series, Fig. 1(a), consists of total daily wind power production in DK1 relative to the total installed capacity, and is obtained by performing the normalization Total daily wind power production (MWh) Installed capacity (MW) · H (24) for each day in the sample, where H denotes the total number of hours in the day. We note that we work in UTC time, so H = 24 always. The second time series, Fig. 1(b), represents the daily average of spot electricity prices.5,6 Before proceeding to the estimation of a joint model for prices and wind power production, two comments are in order. First, since the production series is bounded, with a lower bound at 0 and an upper bound at 1, we perform a logistic transformation in order to obtain data that can take values on the entire real line. Second, we split our data into an in-sample (IS) period spanning from 01/01/2006 to 31/12/2012, and an out-of-sample (OOS) spanning from 01/01/2013 to 31/12/2014. Estimation of marginal models and copulas is performed on the IS data. 3.1. Marginal speciﬁcations for spot electricity prices and wind power production Prior to modeling the dependence structure of electricity prices and wind power production, we ﬁlter out the stylized facts aﬀecting the marginal behavior of the individual variables. As a ﬁrst step, we demean and correct for deterministic seasonality by performing a regression on a constant and dummy variables. Speciﬁcally, we have used the dummy variable month-of-year to correct the (transformed) wind power production series for seasonality. For the price series both day-of-week and month-of-year dummy variables were used as regressors. To model the conditional mean and variance of the variables, we consider ARMA–GARCH models with diﬀerent speciﬁcations for the error distribution. We consider ARMA models up to order (7,7), and GARCH models up to order (2,2). Based on the Bayesian Information Criterion, we ﬁnd that the optimal model for the wind power production series is an ARMA(1,3)–GARCH(1,1), and use a skewed generalized error distribution for the standardized residuals. For the day-ahead electricity prices, we ﬁnd the optimal model to be an ARMA(3,1)–GARCH(1,1), and use a skewed t distribution for the standardized residuals. Table 1 summarizes the estimation results, and Fig. B.10 in Appendix B displays the autocorrelation functions, histograms and quantile plots for the standardized residuals resulting from the ﬁtted models. A visual inspection of Fig. B.10 shows that almost no autocorrelation is left in the standardized residuals. The speciﬁed distributions provide a reasonable ﬁt, however we observe some deviations in the tails of both distributions. We complement these ﬁndings with GoF tests, where we consider the KS and CvM tests. The resulting p-values are given in Table 1 and indicate that there is not suﬃcient evidence as to reject the null that the distributional assumptions are well-speciﬁed.7 We note that ﬁnding suitable marginal models is of great concern when working with copula models, since the copula takes as input iid Unif(0, 1) variables that result from applying the probability integral transform to the standardized residuals. A violation of the assumptions will thus automatically lead to a misspeciﬁed copula model. 5The data is publicly available on Energinet.dk and on the web page of Nord Pool’s Elspot market, nordpoolspot.com. Elspot is a day-ahead physical delivery market for electricity currently operating in the Nordic and Baltic region. 6We note that one observation has been truncated in the price data, corresponding to the date 07/06/13, since this is assessed to be an outlier. On this date, the hourly price reached Nord Pool’s cap price due to a combination of low wind, reduced import possibilities caused by planned maintenance on transmission cables and also planned maintenance on central power stations. 7We perform simulation-based GoF tests, that take the parameter estimation errors from the ARMA–GARCH models into account. Speciﬁcally, we test for whether or not the probability integral transforms implied by the estimated conditional densities are iid Unif(0, 1). The p-values for the tests are based on 999 simulations. 8ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT (a) Daily wind power production measured relative to the total in- stalled capacity.

To do this, we consider the speciﬁed models for the conditional mean with added explanatory variables consisting of seven lagged values of the “other” series, and test for the signiﬁcance of cross-sectional eﬀects by performing a Wald test. For the wind power production, we consider an ARMAX(1,3,7) model, and for the electricity prices, we consider an ARMAX(3,1,7) model. The tests yield a p-value of 0.25 for the wind power production model, and 0.09 for the electricity price model, thus suggesting no cross-equation eﬀects at a 5% signiﬁcance level.8 3.2. Symmetric vs. asymmetric dependence Having decided upon the marginal models for price and wind power production, the remaining of this section focuses on the modeling of the dependence structure. First, we apply the probability integral transform to the stan- dardized residuals resulting from the marginal models to obtain approximately uniformly distributed variables. To perform this transformation, we use the estimated parametric models for the distribution functions F, i.e. the esti- mated skewed generalized error distribution and skewed t distribution, see Table 1. We obtain ˆUW,t = Fskew ged(ˆηW,t, ˆνW , ˆξW ) (25) ˆUS ,t = Fskew t(ˆηS ,t, ˆνS , ˆξS ), (26) where ˆUW,t and ˆUS ,t denote the resulting uniforms corresponding to the wind power production time series and the spot price time series, respectively. Standardized residuals are denoted by ˆη, and estimated distribution parameters are denoted by ˆξ (skew parameter) and ˆν (shape parameter). As an introductory investigation of the dependence structure, we compute some measures of dependence for ˆUW and ˆUS . Table 2 displays the estimated coeﬃcients for Spearman’s ρ, Kendall’s τ and linear correlation, implying (not surprisingly) that prices and wind power production are negatively correlated. Based on Eq. (13) we also compute quantile dependence measures, and the results, displayed in Fig. 2, show evidence for a symmetric dependence struc- ture. When considering the farther right and left portions of Fig. 2(a), the results reveal a slightly larger probability of observing low prices given that the production is high than the opposite. However, according to Fig. 2(b), this diﬀerence is not statistically signiﬁcant.

Constant copula models Although we anticipate time-variation in the dependence structure, we consider six constant copula models, to have as benchmarks for later comparisons. A brief overview of these copula models is provided in Appendix A. The estimation results for the proposed constant copulas are given in Table 3, together with GoF test results. Among the constant copulas we consider, it is only the Gaussian and Student t that allow for negative dependence. To deal with this issue, we have performed suitable rotations of our data when estimating the Clayton, Gumbel, Joe-Frank and Symmetrized Joe-Clayton (SJC) copulas. Furthermore, the Gaussian and the Student t copulas are symmetric, the Clayton and Gumbel are asymmetric, and the combinations Joe-Frank and SJC allow for more ﬂexible dependence structures and nest the case of symmetric dependence. 8We have tried testing for cross-sectional eﬀects with diﬀerent other speciﬁcations, and none of the results indicate cross-equation eﬀects at a 5% signiﬁcance level. 10ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT (a) Quantile dependence (b) Diﬀerence in quantile dependence Figure 2: Fig. 2(a) displays estimated quantile dependence for quantile q ∈ [0.025, 0.975] and a size step of 0.025, along with a 95% conﬁdence interval based on the block-bootstrap procedure described in Section 2.4 and M = 999 bootstrap samples.

The superscript (C) refers to the tests performed on the empirical copula of the standardized residuals and the superscript (R) refers to the tests performed on the empirical copula of the Rosenblatt transforms. The GoF tests are simulation based (999 bootstraps) and take parameter estimation errors into account. 11ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT The GoF results in Table 3 support our earlier ﬁndings in Section 3.2. The Gaussian and Student t copulas are, according to all tests, a good speciﬁcation. Clayton is rejected by all tests, while Gumbel is only partly rejected. For the combination copulas, the test results are more surprising: The Joe-Frank speciﬁcation is accepted by all tests, while the SJC speciﬁcation is rejected by all tests. We attempt to understand these results by plotting the quantile dependence we observe in our data together with the quantile dependence implied by some of the ﬁtted copulas in Fig. 3. Figure 3: Quantile dependence implied by some of the ﬁtted constant copula models in Table 3. We observe that the quantile dependence implied by the Gaussian copula provides a reasonable ﬁt to our data. So does the Joe-Frank copula, by providing a ﬁt that generates almost no asymmetry. The Gumbel copula on the other hand is too asymmetric, producing large deviations as we approach one of the tails. Lastly, the SJC, although implying less asymmetry than Gumbel, assigns too much probability to extreme events compared to what we observe in the data, and thus produces large deviations as we approach both tails.9 3.4. Time-varying copula models To conﬁrm our suspicion that the dependence of spot electricity prices and wind power production is time-varying, we perform the two tests brieﬂy described in Section 2.3. The results are given in Table 4, showing no evidence of a one-time break in the dependence structure, but strong evidence for the presence of autocorrelation in the rank correlations. In light of these ﬁndings, we consider three copula models where the transformed dependence parameter denoted by g evolves according to a GAS(1,1) model, see Eq. (12). The transformations applied to the copula dependence 9We have omitted the quantile dependence implied by the Student t and Clayton copulas in Fig. 3 for clarity reasons. The Student t copula implies quantile dependence coeﬃcients that are almost indistinguishable from the Gaussian ones, which is due to the very high value we estimate for the degree of freedom of this copula. The Clayton copula implies even more asymmetry than Gumbel in the far right side of the quantile plot. 12ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT One-time break Time-varying dep. of autoreg. type AR(1) AR(5) AR(7) p-value 0.7898 0.0020 0.0110 0.0000 Table 4: Test results for time-varying dependence. To test for the presence of a one-time break in the rank correlation we use the “sup” test, and test the null of no one-time break. To test for the presence of time-varying dependence of autoregressive type we consider the regression ˆUW,t ˆUS ,t = µ + ∑p i=1 φi ˆUW,t−i ˆUS ,t−i + εt, for p = 1, 5, 7; the null of a constant copula cannot be rejected if we ﬁnd that φi = 0, for i = 1, . . . , p. For all tests, p-values are obtained by bootstrap testing (based on 999 bootstraps, where bootstrap samples are obtained by randomly drawing rows, with replacement, from ( ˆUW , ˆUS )′). parameters, estimation and GoF test results are all displayed in Table 5. For the Gaussian copula, a closed form expression for the Fisher information can be derived (see e.g. Schepsmeier and St¨ober (2014)). For the Gumbel and the Joe-Frank copulas, the Fisher information is computed numerically by performing the steps in Section 2.3.1. The Joe-Frank copula has two dependence parameters, and we consider the case where one parameter evolves according to the GAS speciﬁcation, while the other is kept constant. It should however be mentioned that letting both parameters vary through time provides very little improvement. Regarding the parameter estimates, α is high in all models, implying a very persistent time-varying correlation process. Also, the intercept parameter ω is not signiﬁcant in any model. As far as the GoF test results are concerned, the Joe-Frank and Gaussian GAS models are accepted at a 5% level, while the Gumbel GAS model is only partially accepted.

Due to the high computational time, the GoF tests and standard errors are based on 99 bootstraps. The superscript (R) indicates that the GoF tests are based on the Rosenblatt transform. To visualize and compare the ﬁts of the proposed GAS models, we plot the conditional rank correlation implied by the ﬁtted time-varying copula models in Fig. 4(a). The numbers are obtained by mapping the copula parameter(s) to a rank correlation coeﬃcient10. In Figs. 4(b)-(d) we plot actual 60-day rolling rank correlations of the data ( ˆUW , ˆUS )′ together with the in-sample ﬁt of the proposed time-varying models. To perform the same comparison for the out-of- sample period, we obtain the approx. uniforms ( ˆUOOS W , ˆUOOS S )′ by ﬁrst applying the estimated function for removing seasonality and then the ARMA–GARCH ﬁlters, without re-estimating any parameters, to the out-of-sample wind power production data and the out-of-sample spot electricity price data. The 60-day rolling rank correlations of ( ˆUOOS W , ˆUOOS S )′ are then computed and compared to one-step-ahead forecasts from the time-varying copulas. Due to the elevated computational cost of using a rolling estimation window to produce forecasts, we restrict ourselves to considering a ﬁxed estimation window corresponding to the in-sample period, but enlarge the conditioning set as information becomes available. 10Speciﬁcally, we follow the procedure described in Patton (2013): (1) construct a grid of copula parameters, (2) perform 100,000 simulations from the copula model at each point in the grid, (3) compute the rank correlation of the simulations, and ﬁnally (4) use linear interpolation to obtain the correlation at intermediate points. We also mention that the functions mapping the copula parameters to rank correlation are smooth. 13ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT (a) Conditional rank correlation implied by time-varying copulas (b) Gaussian copula (c) Gumbel copula (d) Joe-Frank copula Figure 4: Fits and forecasts produced with the three time-varying copulas from Table 5. 14ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT One ﬁrst and surprising remark regarding Fig. 4 is related to the data itself and implicitly the ﬁts produced by the GAS models, namely that the correlation is generally stronger during winter than during summer. There are many factors that can help explain this ﬁnding since price formation is a complex process that is not only inﬂuenced by supply and demand (which in turn have strong seasonal components), but also transmission capacity. To provide a few facts that can help explain our ﬁndings, we mention that the wind power production relative to the consumption in the DK1 price area has been higher for winter periods than summer periods, during the sample period we consider in this paper. Also, we can expect that situations with little wind during summer do not always push the prices upwards. This is (aside from consumption being lower during summer) due to the fact that DK1 is well connected with cables to Norway, Sweden and Germany, which are all heavy producers of renewable energy, and hence electricity could be imported at a lower price compared to the cost of having to turn on the more costly power stations in DK1. Considering now the ﬁts implied by the proposed time-varying copulas, Fig. 4 reveals that the Gaussian GAS implies most variation in the correlation and is able to capture periods with weaker dependence the best. The Gumbel GAS speciﬁcation is the one that least captures the variation that we observe in the data. The Joe-Frank GAS speciﬁ- cation is superior at reaching the stronger correlations, but does not produce correlations that are weaker than around −0.3. The plots clearly help establish that the Gumbel GAS speciﬁcation is the inferior choice. However, it is diﬃcult to choose the better copula when considering the Gaussian GAS against the Joe-Frank GAS. From ﬁtting not only time-varying copulas but also constant ones, we have so far obtained many diﬀerent models that are actually well-speciﬁed according to the GoF tests. To help choose among all the considered copulas, we perform the pairwise comparison tests described in Section 2.5.11 The results are summarized in Table 6. We ﬁnd that The Joe-Frank GAS speciﬁcation outperforms all other speciﬁcations in-sample, however its superiority over the Gaussian GAS speciﬁcation is not statistically signiﬁcant. When considering the out-of-sample results, the situation reverses, with the Gaussian GAS speciﬁcation performing the best, but not signiﬁcantly better than the Joe-Frank GAS. Since the Gaussian GAS is the smaller model, we will choose this speciﬁcation as our preferred one, and continue our investigations using this model to describe the dependence between wind power production and spot electricity prices. 4. A simulation study Performing simulations from a copula model is straightforward. The basic steps are (1) at time t, generate the pair (UW,t, US ,t) from the Gaussian copula with dependence parameter ρt, (2) perform the inverse of the transformations given in Eqs. (25) and (26) to obtain standardized residuals (ηW,t, ηS ,t), (3) insert the standardized residuals in the marginal models from before (see Table 1) to obtain a deseasonalized pair ( ˜YS ,t, ˜YW,t), (4) use the estimated seasonal function to obtain a pair (YS ,t, YW,t) of spot electricity price and wind power production, (5) compute ρt+1 using the Gaussian GAS update equation and (6) repeat steps (1)–(5). Using this procedure one day at a time, we can construct spot electricity price series and wind power production series; and by repeating the process many times, an empirical distribution is produced. Such an empirical distribution is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 illustrates the simulated conditional joint distribution for December 2013 obtained by simulating 10,000 random paths for a one-month horizon. Note that although we have chosen a Gaussian copula model for the depen- dence structure, the marginal distributions were chosen to be a skewed generalized error distribution and a skewed t distribution for the wind power production and spot electricity prices, respectively. Therefore, the resulting joint distribution is not bivariate normal; as illustrated in Fig. 5, the simulated distribution exhibits asymmetry and heavy tails. We will now use our model to study how diﬀerent wind scenarios aﬀect the distribution of prices. To this end, we perform one-month ahead simulations for all OOS months, i.e. a total of 24 months. Due to the elevated computational cost, we do not re-estimate the parameters of our joint model; we do however enlarge the conditioning set one month at the time. In Figs. 6(a)–(b), we display simulated empirical price distributions conditional on diﬀerent levels of low/high wind scenarios. The simulations are grouped into winter (Dec., Jan., Feb.) and summer (Jun., Jul., Aug.) months. To deﬁne what a low/high wind scenario is during winter, we have considered the 20% and 80% quantiles of our actual OOS wind power production data during the speciﬁed winter months; the same procedure was followed 11The in-sample pairwise comparison between the Gaussian and the Student t copula is based on a simple t-test, since these models are nested. 15ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT In-sample model comparisons Gaussian Student t Clayton Gumbel Joe-Frank SJC GaussianGAS GumbelGAS Joe-FrankGAS Gaussian Student t 1.88∗ Clayton −4.61∗∗∗ −5.04∗∗∗ Gumbel −2.20∗∗ −2.71∗∗∗ 7.07∗∗∗ Joe-Frank 1.40 1.28 5.27∗∗∗ 3.10∗∗∗ SJC −3.91∗∗∗ −4.91∗∗∗ 3.32∗∗∗ −1.74∗ −3.54∗∗∗ GaussianGAS 2.94∗∗∗ 2.54∗∗∗ 5.71∗∗∗ 3.63∗∗∗ 0.44 5.30∗∗∗ GumbelGAS −1.12 −1.42 8.08∗∗∗ 2.91∗∗∗ −2.00∗∗ 3.07∗∗∗ −2.91∗∗∗ Joe-FrankGAS 3.14∗∗∗ 3.12∗∗∗ 6.37∗∗∗ 4.44∗∗∗ 3.20∗∗∗ 4.88∗∗∗ 1.57 3.66∗∗∗ log L 355.06 357.13 288.93 331.14 368.77 320.17 373.90 342.90 388.77 Out-of-sample model comparisons Gaussian Student t Clayton Gumbel Joe-Frank SJC GaussianGAS GumbelGAS Joe-FrankGAS Gaussian Student t 1.41 Clayton −4.36∗∗∗ −4.95∗∗∗ Gumbel −1.58 −2.04∗∗ 8.18∗∗∗ Joe-Frank 0.16 −0.22 3.64∗∗∗ 1.32 SJC −2.67∗∗∗ −3.43∗∗∗ 5.19∗∗∗ −1.99∗∗ −1.99∗∗ GaussianGAS 2.85∗∗∗ 2.76∗∗∗ 5.61∗∗∗ 3.54∗∗∗ 2.04∗∗ 4.56∗∗∗ GumbelGAS −0.67 −0.96 6.53∗∗∗ 2.22∗∗ −0.63 2.53∗∗∗ −2.75∗∗∗ Joe-FrankGAS 1.76∗ 1.58 4.21∗∗∗ 2.38∗∗∗ 2.46∗∗∗ 2.90∗∗∗ −0.29 1.82∗ log L 160.10 161.48 129.55 150.52 160.67 146.11 171.96 155.25 170.56 Table 6: t-statistics from in-sample and out-of-sample pairwise model comparisons.

The results are based on 10,000 simulations (for each day of December) and a Gaussian GAS model for the dependence structure. 17ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT for the summer months. For both the winter and the summer period, we observe that the diﬀerent wind scenarios shift the simulated price distributions. Moreover, the simulated distributions are left-skewed for the high wind scenarios (the skewness parameter is −1.98 for the winter months and −1.03 for the summer months), implying that extreme low prices are more likely than extreme high prices. For the low wind scenarios, the estimated distributions are right- skewed (the skewness is 0.64 and 1.06 for the winter and summer months respectively), thus implying the opposite compared to the high wind cases. We also notice that the low/high wind scenarios push the price distributions further apart for the winter months than the summer months, which we have conﬁrmed by measuring the Kullback-Leibler distance between distributions. This can be explained by the fact that during summer periods, the dependence between electricity prices and wind power production is weaker than during winter periods, as earlier illustrated in Fig. 4. All these features are present when performing the same calculations on the actual data, which we show in Figs. 6(c)– (d), conﬁrming that our empirical model captures the dynamics between daily spot electricity prices and wind power production. 5. Application to pricing and risk management In the following we present applications of the proposed joint model for spot electricity prices and wind power production. We start by consider an energy trading company that enters into agreements with wind power producers, where a predetermined ﬁxed price R is paid for the ﬂuctuating wind power production. Since the production will ﬁrst become known through the delivery period of the agreements, these products imply a volumetric risk. Furthermore, we assume that the trading company sells the production it receives from the wind power producers on the day-ahead market, at a spot price we denote by S . Hence, the company will also be exposed to price risk. In the remaining of this section, we will refer to such agreements as ﬁxed price for ﬂuctuating wind power production agreements. With such a formulation, we can express the proﬁt of the trading company as T2∑ t=T1 Qt(S t − R), (27) where time is measured in days, Qt is the wind power production at time period t, S t is the daily spot electricity price valid at t, and R is a ﬁxed price set at the inception of the contract, which we denote t0. Furthermore, the contract length spans from T1 to T2, where t0 < T1 ≤ T2. We note that to participate in the day-ahead electricity auction market, buy or sell bids have to be made to the exchange one day before delivery takes place. By working with the payoﬀ in Eq. (27), we implicitly assume that the quantity we bid one day before equals the actual wind power production, i.e. Qt = Et−1 [Qt] , (28) where Et−1 [Qt] denotes the expectation at time t − 1 for the production at time t. Thus, we assume no balancing risk. What diﬀerentiates the product described above with payoﬀ given in Eq. (27) from a standard forward contract is the production uncertainty associated with the former, and hence the presence of an additional risk due to the correlation between S and Q. If we express the price R in terms of the forward price F, Eq. (27) becomes T2∑ t=T1 Qt(S t − (F − c)), (29) where F ≡ F(t0, T1, T2) denotes the forward price at time t0, for the delivery period from T1 to T2 and c ≡ c(t0, T1, T2) denotes the compensation that is to be subtracted from the forward price due to the negative correlation between prices and volume. So c can be thought of as the price of correlation risk. The fair value of c can be obtained by the usual practice of setting the discounted conditional expectation of the payoﬀ given in Eq. (29) equal to zero. 12 To ease the presentation, we will assume a risk-free rate of zero, thus obtaining: E Q t0   T2∑ t=T1 Qt(S t − (F − c))   = 0, (30) 12Risk preferences could easily be included by e.g. introducing a simple volumetric risk aversion rule like in Kolos and Mardanov (2008). 18ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT (a) Simulated prices: winter period (b) Simulated prices: summer period (c) Actual prices: winter period (d) Actual prices: summer period Figure 6: Distributions for the daily spot electricity prices during winter and summer months, for the out-of-sample period 01/01/2013 to 31/12/2014, under the assumption of high and low wind power production. The simulated predictive distributions are based on 10,000 one- month-ahead simulations, using a Gassian GAS model for the dependence structure. Fig. 6(c) and Fig. 6(d) are based on 37 observations. To deﬁne the percentage corresponding to high/low wind scenarios during winter and summer, we used the 0.20 and 0.80 quantiles of the actual out-of-sample wind power production data. 19ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT c = F − E Q t0   T2∑ t=T1 QtS t   E Q t0   T2∑ t=T1 Qt   . (31) With our framework, an estimate for c can easily be obtained by performing Monte Carlo simulations from the proposed copula model. However, this estimate will reﬂect the price of correlation risk under the physical or objective measure P, since the model is ﬁtted to historical spot electricity price and wind power production data. According to Eqs. (30) and (31), the expectations must be taken under a pricing measure Q, that will reﬂect the risk premium charged by, in our context, the energy trading company oﬀering the “insurance” to the wind power producer. Following Benth et al. (2008), the pricing measure Q is equivalent to P, but needs not be an equivalent martingale measure due to the non-storability of our underlying “assets”. Since neither electricity nor wind can be stored, they are not tradable assets in the classical sense. This implies that the spot–forward relation, for example, cannot be derived based on a buy-and-hold hedging argument. Instead, the usual practice is to simply deﬁne the forward price as the conditional expectation of the spot electricity price under the risk-neutral probability measure Q, thereby turning the discounted spot price into a martingale (see Benth and Meyer-Brandis (2009) and Benth and ˘Saltyt˙e Benth (2012)). Indeed, by deﬁning F(t0, T1, T2) = E Q t0   1 T2 − T1 + 1 T2∑ t=T1 S t   , (32) for the case of electricity, one can compute the implied market price of risk by considering the diﬀerence between quoted forward prices in the market and forward prices obtained by simulation with our model under P.13 In theory, the same could be done to estimate the risk premium associated with wind, however forwards with wind index as underlying are not currently traded in most European energy markets – and if they are, they are highly illiquid. The fact that our setting is a bivariate one complicates the question of measure change even further, since aside from the marginal behavior of spot electricity price and wind power production under Q, implied information regard- ing the market price of dependency risk must also be provided. A parametrization of this is not straightforward; in fact, the discussion can become quite extensive in the context of copulas and incomplete markets. Such a discus- sion is outside the scope of this paper, and we refer instead to Cherubini et al. (2004) for more details. Moreover, even if a theoretical procedure to calibrate the market price of dependency risk were to be established, the lack of exchange-traded instruments written on spot times wind would impede applying this in practice. In light of the above discussion, we turn to the rational expectation hypothesis, which is a valid choice and a common assumption in this context (see e.g. Benth and Kettler (2011), Coulon et al. (2013), and Oum and Oren (2010)). This implies that we set P = Q, i.e. set the market price of risk to zero. Since we suspect a measure change to yield diﬀerent prices, but not to alter the overall conclusions in our following empirical analysis, we ﬁnd this assumption to be a reasonable one. According to the payoﬀ in Eqs. (27) or (29), it is clear by now that we are dealing with two sources of risk simultaneously: one is related to price uncertainty, and the other is related to production uncertainty; and since the market is incomplete, a perfect hedge cannot be performed. However, the price risk can be hedged. Here, we construct a simple hedging portfolio by taking a short position in a quantity H∗ of standard forward power contracts. We assume that the hedge is static and performed at time t0. The payoﬀ of the hedge for the entire delivery period is given by H∗  E Q t0   1 T2 − T1 + 1 T2∑ t=T1 S t   − 1 T2 − T1 + 1 T2∑ t=T1 S t   , (33) or in a compact form H∗(F − S ), (34) 13For further discussions and empirical studies regarding pricing in electricity markets we refer to Benth et al. (2013), Burger et al. (2004), Kolos and Ronn (2008), and Lucia and Schwartz (2000). 20ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT where F denotes the same forward price as in Eq. (29), and S denotes the average day-ahead electricity price for the same delivery period. To obtain H∗, we ﬁx c to its value obtained from Eq. (31) and follow the standard procedure of minimizing the variance of the portfolio payoﬀ: min H∗ Vart0   T2∑ t=T1 ˜Qt(S t − (F − c)) + H∗(F − S )  . (35) In Eq. (35), ˜Qt = 24 · Qt · Λ, with Λ being the total installed capacity under the agreement that pays out a prede- termined ﬁxed price in return for the ﬂuctuation wind power production. Since Qt corresponds to daily wind power production relative to the total installed capacity in the entire DK1 price area, we need to transform this number to daily wind power production measured in MWh corresponding to the total installed capacity that the energy trading company actually has under agreement. By performing this transformation, we imply that our joint model is a good representation on a smaller scale. This is a realistic assumption as long as the energy trading company manages a portfolio of diversiﬁed wind turbines in terms of type and location. Solving for H∗ in Eq. (35) yields H∗ = Covt0  S , T2∑ t=T1 ˜QtS t   − (F − c)Covt0  S , T2∑ t=T1 ˜Qt   Vart0 [ S ] . (36) It is clear that by hedging a quantity that is equal to H∗, we are protected on average and not against worst case scenarios, such as the combination of extremely low prices / high wind power production, which is a probable outcome in the DK1 price area. We could remedy the situation to a large extent by adding options to our portfolio, however this is outside the scope of the present paper. Work related to the optimal hedging of volumetric risk associated with wind power production is, to the best of our knowledge, not yet available. However, energy related discussions regarding the hedging of volumetric risk associated with consumers’ load are presented in e.g. Oum and Oren (2009) and Oum et al. (2006), where many of the ideas can be transferred to our application. Nonetheless, our simple hedge is actually realistic since the market for options is very illiquid in DK1. 5.1. Example 1 Having developed a joint model for day-ahead electricity prices and wind power production, we can perform Monte Carlo simulations and use Eq. (31) to ﬁnd the fair ﬁxed price/compensation of a contract with any given speciﬁcations. Assume that we stand on the last trading day of November 2013, denoted t0, and wish to ﬁnd the ﬁxed price for a front month contract, namely a December 2013 contract. Given all information available up to and including the valuation date t0, we perform 10,000 simulations for price and quantity from our proposed joint model, where for each simulation we keep a path of length 31 (since we work with daily data) corresponding to the number of days in December. We note that we work with a ﬁxed estimation window corresponding to the IS period, but enlarge the ﬁltration, conditioning on the information up to and including the valuation date t0. The contract speciﬁcations and results are summarized in Table 7, and we see that due to the negative correlation between prices and production, the compensation c that is to be subtracted from the forward price equals 3.24 EUR/MWh. In addition to calculating the ﬁxed price of a contract with ﬂuctuating wind power production, we can extract infor- mation from the performed simulations that can be useful in a risk management context. We assume that agreements corresponding to an installed capacity of 500 MW are entered into on the last trading day of November 2013, with delivery December 2013. The price of a standard forward contract is ﬁxed to its estimated value of 35.26 EUR/MWh, and the price of an agreement with a ﬂuctuating wind power production is set to 32.02 EUR/MWh cf. Table 7. Given these speciﬁcations, we estimate the distribution of the portfolio payoﬀ (see Fig. 7) and calculate the 5% Value-at-Risk (see Table 7) in two cases: One where the portfolio includes a price hedge, and one without a price hedge. When covering our price exposure in the forward market by assuming a short position corresponding to a quantity of H∗ forwards, we observe that the variance of the proﬁt distribution reduces signiﬁcantly. In this example, the 5% Value- at-Risk is reduced from approximately EUR 1.1 million to EUR 0.5 million. It is also important to notice that the proﬁt distribution is in both cases asymmetric, with a heavy-tail to the left, translating to the fact that expected losses are greater than expected gains. 21ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Contract information Time of valuation t0 29/11/2013 Contract length T1 to T2 01/12/2013 to 31/12/2013 Pricing results Simulated forward price F ≡ F(t0, T1, T2) 35.26 EUR/MWh Price of correlation risk c ≡ c(t0, T1, T2) cf.

The results are based on 10,000 simulations of price and quantity, using a Gaussian GAS model for the dependence structure. The forward price is ﬁxed to 35.26 EUR/MWh, the compensation is ﬁxed to 3.24 EUR/MWh and the total installed capacity of the portfolio equals 500 MW. The variance minimizing hedge quantity H∗ is obtained by performing the calculation in Eq. (36). 22ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Revisiting the issue of pricing and considering the proﬁt distributions in Fig. 7, alternative approaches to that of performing a measure change can be applied. An example can be to consider an a priori given 5% Value-at-Risk level that is acceptable, and solve for the correlation risk premium that satisﬁes this level. To stress the eﬀect of correlation on the proﬁt distribution, we perform additional simulations, where all but the copula model remains unchanged. Speciﬁcally, we assume the independence copula and thus a zero compensation, instead of the Gaussian GAS model which we have established reﬂects the reality to a much greater extent. Fig. 8(a) illustrates the estimated proﬁt distributions of the portfolio (with no hedge), and shows that the negative correlation implies a distribution that is more asymmetric. If prices and production were independent, we estimate a 5% Value- at-Risk of EUR 0.93 million corresponding to a reduction of approximately 15% compared to the 5% Value-at- Risk of EUR 1.1 million we obtain with the Gaussian GAS copula. Assuming independence would thus lead to an underestimation of risk. We also display the average spot electricity price for the period of the contract as a function of the estimated proﬁt in Fig. 8(b). Under independence, we observe that the payoﬀ becomes linear, and hence forwards would suﬃce as hedging instruments. Under negative dependence, the payoﬀ becomes non-linear, emphasizing the need for options in the hedging portfolio. Furthermore, we observe that a larger proﬁt (smaller loss) can be obtained if prices and production are independent as we move away from the mean average price of 35.26 EUR/MWh. This is also supported by Fig. 8(a), where we observe that the negative correlation implies that a smaller probability is assigned to large proﬁts, and a higher probability is assigned to large losses.

Figure 8: Illustration of the importance of correlation in the analysis of proﬁt. The results are based on 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations with a Gaussian GAS copula (c is ﬁxed to 3.24 EUR/MWh) and the independence copula (c is ﬁxed to 0 EUR/MWh), respectively. The total installed capacity of the portfolio is set to 500 MW, and the same marginal models for prices and wind power production are used. 23ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5.2. Example 2 In Section 3.4, we have established that some of the ﬁtted time-varying copula models are superior to the constant ones, see e.g. Table 6. Here, we wish to investigate if this also holds when comparing the actual proﬁts or losses generated with diﬀerent copula models. For this, we consider the OOS period corresponding to the years 2013 and 2014. We assume the following trading strategy: On the last trading day of each month (Dec. 2012 - Nov. 2014), we enter into front month agreements with wind power generators, where a ﬁxed price is paid for the ﬂuctuating wind power production. The total installed capacity of each monthly portfolio is ﬁxed to 500 MW. We perform 10,000 simulations from joint models with the diﬀerent copula speciﬁcations that we wish to compare against each other (marginal models are kept unchanged), and estimate compensations c and hedge quantities H∗ for each month at a time using Eqs. (31) and (36). For each monthly portfolio, we then calculate the realized proﬁt using the actual daily electricity prices, actual daily wind power production14 and actual forward prices. For clarity, let us consider a concrete example: We stand on the last trading day of December 2012, and wish to enter into ﬁxed price agreements with ﬂuctuating wind power production for the January 2013 month. To enter the contract, we ﬁrst estimate the ﬁxed price that we are willing to pay for the production that we will receive during January. Since we also perform a hedge in the forward market, we estimate the quantity of forwards we are to short. In this example, we will use a constant Clayton copula to describe the dependence between prices and wind power production, and hence we obtain an estimated compensation denoted by ˆcClayton t0,Jan and an estimated hedge quantity ˆH∗,Clayton t0,Jan . On the last trading day of December 2012, we can observe the actual forward price FObs t0 , and thus the ﬁxed price we oﬀer the wind power producers is ˆR Clayton t0,Jan = FObs t0 − ˆcClayton t0,Jan . (37) By the end of January 2013, we will also have observed the actual daily spot electricity prices S Obs and the actual daily wind power production QObs for the DK1 price area. With this information, we can now approximate the actual proﬁt resulting from the trades we have performed: Actual proﬁtJan = T2∑ t=T1 ˜QObs t (S Obs t − ˆR Clayton t0,Jan ) ︸ ︷︷ ︸ Agreement payoﬀ + ˆH∗,Clayton t0,Jan (FObs t0 − S Obs) ︸ ︷︷ ︸ Hedge payoﬀ (38) where t0 = 31/12/2012, T1 = 01/01/2013, T2 = 31/01/2013 and ˜QObs is the approximation ˜QObs t = QObs t · 24 (h) · 500 (MW). (39) The results obtained by performing the above calculations for all OOS months with diﬀerent copula speciﬁcations are presented in Table 8. The numbers show that the joint model with a Gaussian GAS copula provides the highest (lowest) monthly proﬁt (loss) in 15 out of the 24 months, corresponding to 62.50%. Considering the second column block of Table 8, we see that it is indeed the Gaussian GAS and the Joe-Frank GAS that yield the lowest losses in average, which supports the results we obtained in Section 3.4. Hence, allowing for time variation in a suitable copula model is beneﬁcial. The constant Clayton speciﬁcation performs the poorest, generating the largest average loss. This is again in accordance with earlier ﬁndings, where we have established that the constant Clayton speciﬁcation is not suitable for the dependence of prices and wind power production, and also least suitable among the copula models we consider in Table 8. The time-varying Gaussian and Joe-Frank copulas outperform the other copulas since they are able to capture the increasingly negative correlation we observe towards the last years of our sample (see Fig. 4); and thus, they are able to generate larger compensations. For instance, the constant Gaussian copula yields an average compensation for the OOS period of 2.69 EUR/MWh, while the Gaussian GAS copula yields a value of 2.98 EUR/MWh. 14The actual daily wind power production is given in % for the entire price area, but only a subset of the existing wind turbines in DK1 is part of our portfolio. Therefore, we note that the realized proﬁt we calculate is an approximation; We obtain the actual production of the wind turbines under agreement by multiplying the actual daily wind power production for the entire price area with the assumed installed capacity of the portfolio of 500 MW and 24 hours. 24ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Highest proﬁt (lowest loss) Realized average proﬁt for per month for the OOS period the OOS period (EUR/MWh) Constant Time-varying (GAS) Constant Time-varying (GAS) Gaussian 4.16% 62.50% -0.9144 -0.6103 Gumbel 16.67% 0.00% -0.8693 -0.7961 Joe-Frank 0.00% 16.67% -1.0294 -0.6666 Clayton 0.00% - -1.1465 - Table 8: OOS model comparisons based on realized monthly proﬁt/loss. In the ﬁrst column block, we calculate how often each copula model yields the lowest monthly loss or the highest monthly proﬁt. The second column block presents the realized average proﬁt/loss (in EUR/MWh) for selected copula models, obtained by dividing the total realized cash-ﬂow for the period by the total realized wind power production. All results are based on the same trading strategy and 10,000 simulations. Lastly, we illustrate in Fig. 9 the evolution of actual forward prices and also the evolution of compensations estimated with our proposed joint model for electricity prices and wind power production, i.e. the one with the Gaussian GAS copula speciﬁcation for the dependence structure. Overall, compensations amount to an increasing percentage of the forward price during the period of our study. Clearly, this is mainly due to the decreasing tendency in forward prices, but also due to the slight increase in compen- sations if we consider the IS and OOS average compensations. The slight increase in compensations can be justiﬁed by the increasing installed capacity of wind power that Denmark has experienced over the past years - and hence the stronger dependence between wind power production and electricity prices. This also explains the decrease in forward prices, but only to a small extent; the major contributing factor here has been the decreasing raw material prices. The reduction in forward price due to the correlation risk amounts to an average of 7%, and can reach as high as 11%. A similar conclusion is reached by Elberg and Hagspiel (2015), where the authors study the market value of wind power at diﬀerent locations in Germany, and show that this value is reduced compared to the average spot price as a result of increasing wind power penetration. 6. Conclusion This work concentrates on the dependency between daily spot electricity prices and wind power production, and its role regarding the pricing and the risk distributions associated with contracts exposed to both price and volumetric risk. The analysis is carried out on data from the Danish power market, which is characterized by a high penetration of wind power in the system. We propose a copula approach since we wish to concentrate on the dependence in more detail. We employ marginal models of the ARMA–GARCH type and parametric error distributions for each individ- ual variable, and then link the innovations through various constant and time-varying copulas. Based on statistical tests concerning copula selection, we choose a time-varying Gaussian copula as our preferred speciﬁcation for the dependence structure. By performing Monte Carlo simulation studies, we are able to visualize the joint empirical distribution implied by our model, and see how this deviates from the Gaussian benchmark. Also, we study the dis- tribution of prices conditional on diﬀerent levels of wind power penetration, and show that prices decrease (increase), on average, at times of high (low) levels of wind power production; the shape of the conditional distribution of prices is also aﬀected by the diﬀerent levels of wind power production. These ﬁndings conﬁrm what previous studies con- cerned with the impact of wind power – or predicted wind power penetration – on electricity prices have shown (e.g. Gelabert et al. (2011), J´onnson et al. (2010)). We apply the developed empirical model in the context of an energy trading company oﬀering wind power pro- ducers a predetermined ﬁxed price for their ﬂuctuating wind power production. We ﬁnd that the correlation risk premium that the energy trading company should charge when entering such agreements is signiﬁcant, amounting to 7% of the price of a standard forward power contract on average. Furthermore, our results indicate that the choice of copula impacts the price of correlation risk: An out-of-sample study based on comparing realized proﬁts generated by diﬀerent copulas shows that introducing time-variation in the copula model is beneﬁcial. When considering the proﬁt distribution, we ﬁnd that under independence, the risk is underestimated. Additionally, we show that a simple hedge in the forward market can reduce e.g. the 5% Value-at-Risk of the proﬁt distribution signiﬁcantly. However, due to 25ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT (a) Actual forward prices for a front month (M1) contract, valid the last trading day before delivery start.

Finally, although our empirical study concentrates on the Danish power market, the mechanism of spot price formation in e.g. other European electricity markets is also based on matching supply and demand. Further, wind power production has a very low marginal cost, ensuring that it will always be represented in the merit order stack. Due to the physical conditions upon which the day-ahead electricity markets are based, we believe that the proposed modeling framework is relevant and can be applied to other electricity markets that, like Denmark, rely heavily on wind power production. Such extensions are left for future research. Appendix A. Properties of selected copula models Appendix A.1. Elliptical copulas A bivariate elliptical copula is deﬁned as C(u1, u2) = F(F−1 1 (u1), F−1 2 (u2)), (A.1) where u1, u2 ∈ [0, 1]. The elliptical copulas we consider in this paper are the Gaussian copula and the Student t copula. In the case of the Gaussian copula, F corresponds to the bivariate standard normal cdf, and F−1 1 and F−1 2 denote the inverse of the univariate standard normal cdf. In the case of the Student t copula, F corresponds to the bivariate Student t cdf, and F−1 1 and F−1 2 denote the inverse of the univariate Student t cdf. Properties of these copulas are summarized in Table A.9. Appendix A.2. Archimedian copulas A bivariate Archimedian copula is deﬁned as C(u1, u2) = φ −1(φ(u1) + φ(u2)), (A.2) where u1, u2 ∈ [0, 1] and φ : [0, 1] → [0, ∞) is a generator function satisfying that φ−1 is monotone on [0, ∞). The Archimedian copulas we consider in this paper are Clayton and Gumbel, and also the combinations Joe-Frank and a symmetrized version of Joe-Clayton.

Energy Economics 34, 1435 – 1446. 30ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Highlights • A copula model is proposed for electricity spot prices and wind power production. • Evidence of time-varying dependence between prices and production is found. • The pricing of contracts exposed to joint price and volumetric risk is investigated. • We show that assuming independence leads to an underestimation of risk. • We ﬁnd that the choice of copula model inﬂuences the price of correlation risk. • A simple hedge in the forward market reduces risk signiﬁcantly. 31","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
