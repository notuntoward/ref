O o Copilot Certainly! Let's break down the axes for both the regular supply curve and the inverse supply curve: 1. Regular Supply Curve: o X-Axis (Horizontal): Represents the quantity of the product or service supplied by producers. o Y-Axis (Vertical): Represents the price at which the product or service is offered in the market. o The curve slopes upward, indicating that as prices increase, the quantity supplied by producers also increases. 2. Inverse Supply Curve: o X-Axis (Horizontal): Represents the price at which the product or service is offered. o Y-Axis (Vertical): Represents the quantity of the product or service that suppliers are willing to produce and sell. o The curve slopes downward, signifying that as prices rise, the quantity supplied decreases. In summary: o For the regular supply curve, the X-axis represents quantity supplied, and the Y-axis represents price. Â® For the inverse supply curve, it's the opposite: the X-axis represents price, and the Y-axis represents quantity supplied.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
