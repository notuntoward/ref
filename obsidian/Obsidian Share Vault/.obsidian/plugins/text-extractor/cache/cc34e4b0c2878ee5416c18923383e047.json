The gross domestic product is consistently on the rise. Job growth finished 2024 on a strong note, beating expectations. And inflation is easing, with the coreconsumer price index — which excludes volatile food and fuel prices — showing its smallest increase in six months in December. The stock market is also booming, fueling record-high retirement account balances and a record number of “401(k) millionaires.” Americans should be feeling great about the economy, right? Wrong. Voters handed Donald Trump a victory in November, reflecting widespread discontent with inflation and angst about financial security. It’s a feeling that haspersisted in the economy since the pandemic: Consumers have dealt with shocking price hikes on housing, groceries, child care and more. While Trump will inherit arobust economy, these cost-of-living stresses will continue to weigh on Americans. “We’re coming out of a very long five and a half years with lots of disruptionsand lots of upheaval,” said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors. “We’re, in a lot of ways, back to normal — but back to normal doesn’t mean ashared experience.” Though metrics such as GDP and job growth show a healthy economy, these sevencharts offer insight into why Americans are still feeling crunched. 1 C o n s u m e r p r i c e s Return to menu Inflation has cooled significantly since its red-hot levels in 2022, but that doesnot mean prices have gone down. That alone can sour consumers’ moods because it doesn’t match their expectations, Sahm said. Even though wages have largely keptup with inflation, consumers “don’t want to pay those higher prices.” “There’s something about what people were expecting this economy to deliver them,and it fell short,” she said. 2 P a y m e n t - t o - i n c o m e r a t i o f o r h o u s i n g Return to menu For new home buyers, monthly payments on mortgages began eating into a greatershare of their income, as interest rates on 30-year fixed mortgages steadily marched up after 2020. Home values not falling with those higher interest ratesput an even greater squeeze on home buyers, said Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow. Prices remain elevated because inventory continues to be constrained by homeowners unwilling to relinquish the low-interest mortgages they secured before the recentinterest rate hikes. Housing inventory had been low even before the mortgage “lock-in” effect, Olsen said. Rent also spiked beginning in 2021 because a rush of millennials moved out of their parents’ houses, creating immense demand in the rental market, where supplyhad already been limited. 3 C a r p a y m e n t s Return to menu Average monthly car payments also continue to rise . Consumers are taking out larger loans to pay for increasingly expensive cars, with interest rates influenced by rates set by the Federal Reserve, which are still high at around 4.3 percent . Zero-interest deals also are harder to find. Return to menu Credit card debt grew to $1.17 trillion — jumping 8.1 percent, or $24 billion, from the same period last year. Mortgage balances also hit $12.59 trillion in thethird quarter, up from $12.49 trillion a year earlier. Though wages continue to rise — and more consumers have been staying on top of their payments — such liabilities still weigh on their ability to save, invest or cover essential costs. 5 C h i l d - c a r e c o s t s Return to menu Even as inflation has largely cooled for goods such as groceries and fuel, child-care costs have only continued to rise since 2021 — weighing on families already dealing with elevated prices. In December, child-care costs rose 5.9 percent,about double the rate of overall inflation — driven in part by child-care centers shutting down during the pandemic, rising labor costs and the $24 billion infederal assistance drying up . Child-care costs may fall into the category of prices that have an outsize impact on people feeling crunched, said Betsey Stevenson, an economics professor at theUniversity of Michigan. Food and gas inflation also tend to frustrate people in this way, she said. 6 E g g p r i c e s Return to menu The price of eggs, a core household staple, also has shot up in recent months. An outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu that began in February 2022 has killed morethan 100 million egg-laying birds and continues constraining supply — driving up prices. “Bird flu is by far the biggest factor involved with egg prices,” Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, said in November, as eggs disappeared from grocery stores ahead of the holidays. “As bird flu comes and goes, our egg prices ride the wave.” 7 S a v i n g a n d S p e n d i n g Return to menu Americans are saving far less than they were during the pandemic, with the personal savings rate hovering near lows last seen during the Great Recession. Thedrop-off in savings comes as consumers are spending more on vacations, concerts and sporting events, with such spending surging 30 percent last year compared with2019. Behavioral finance experts say the pandemic changed consumers’ view of money, contributing to splurges on things they missed during lockdowns. Spending on all goods and services — not just extras — has consistently risen, as seen in the steady rise of personal consumption expenditures. Retail sales alsogrew in November and December amid the holiday shopping season. Consumers don’t want the high price tags, Sahm said, but “it’s a very oddsituation for a lot of those Americans: They’ve got their stuff — you’re just mad.”","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
