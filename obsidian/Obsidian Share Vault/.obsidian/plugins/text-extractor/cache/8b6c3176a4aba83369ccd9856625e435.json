And the basic message they sent to their governments was one of dissatisfaction and anger with the status quo. Their frustration seemed to beparticularly focused on the side that has traditionally been identified with big government, the left. Almost everywhere you look, the left is in ruins. Of the 27 countries of the European Union, only a handful have left-of-center parties leading government coalitions. The primary left-of-center party in the European Parliament now has just 136 seats in a 720-seat chamber. Even in countries that have been able to stem the rise of right-wing populism, such as Poland, it is the center-right that is thriving, not the left. And in the United States, of course, the breadth ofDonald Trump’s victory — nearly 90 percent of U.S. counties moved right — suggests that it is very much part of this trend. The crisis of democratic government then, is actually a crisis of progressive government. People seem to feel that they have been taxed, regulated, bossedaround and intimidated by left-of-center politicians for decades — but the results are bad and have been getting worse. New York, where I live, and Florida, where I often visit, provide an interesting contrast. They have comparable populations — New York with about 20 million people, Florida with 23 million. But New York state’s budget is more than double that of Florida( $239 billion vs. roughly $116 billion ). New York City, which is a little more than three times the size of Miami-Dade County, has a budget of more than $100billion, which is nearly 10 times that of Miami-Dade. New York City’s spending grew from 2012 to 2019 by 40 percent, four times the rate of inflation. Does any New Yorker feel that they got 40 percent better services during that time? What do New Yorkers get for these vast sums, generated by the highest tax rates in the country? (If you are well off in New York City, you pay nearly as much in income taxes as in London, Paris or Berlin — without free higher education orhealth care.) New York’s poverty rate is higher than Florida’s. New York has a slightly lower rate of homeownership and a much higher rate of homelessness . Despite spending more than twice as much on education per student, New York has educational outcomes — graduation rates , eighth-grade test scores — that are roughly the same as Florida’s. Follow Fareed Zakaria It’s easy to comfort oneself by thinking that these sky-high tax rates and growing government revenues are providing some crucial ingredients of progressivegovernment. But they are often simply the toll of waste and mismanagement. The first phase of the Second Avenue subway line construction, at $2.5 billion per mile, was eight to 12 times more expensive than a sampling of similar projects in places such as Italy, Sweden, Paris and Berlin. A large chunk of state and citytax revenues goes to fund pensions. In Illinois , more than 8 percent of the budget goes toward pensions. In New York City , nearly 22 percent of the budget funds pensions and benefits for government workers. Promising government workers generous pensions has been an easy way to buy the support of a crucial voting blocwhile ensuring that the costs don’t show up in the budgets until years later. The United States’ big cities are incubators of growth, vitality and energy.That’s why the spotlight is placed on them and their governance. And what people have seen recently is liberalism run amok. For years, theft was rampant inCalifornia’s cities because of a weak shoplifting law . New York City’s homeless — some of whom are drug addicts or mentally ill — are left to frighten and harassthe public on the streets and in the subways. The man charged this week with attempted murder after allegedly pushing a man in front of a subway train hadprior arrests . The ultimate test, of course, is how people are voting with their feet. For years,New York has been losing people to states such as Florida. This same story can be told with minor variations about California and Texas. Basically, big red statesare growing at the expense of big blue states, which will translate politically into more Republican representation in Congress and more electoral votes. There is now an interesting effort by people such as Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to combine cultural conservatism and economic nationalism with the radical reformof government. That could be an appealing ideology for many voters who are frustrated by a government in which nothing seems to work that well. On the other side, if Democrats do not learn some hard lessons from the poor governance in many blue cities and states, they will be seen as defending culturalelites, woke ideology and bloated, inefficient government. That might be a formula for permanent minority status.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
