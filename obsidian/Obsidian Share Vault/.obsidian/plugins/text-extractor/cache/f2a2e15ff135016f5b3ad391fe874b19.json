It does it by examining the produced conflict files and iteratively inducing feasibility. Progress (deployed): Implemented Conflict Analyzer in the Master Production Scheduler solver and extended its code to work with other solver specialized in wafer fabs. Gating analysis The gating analysis aims to identify sourcing constraints that induce specific values on key variables after the optimization. For example, explaining why variables that capture unsatisfied demand take value. Progress (deployed): Coded first version of the Gating Analyzer that enforces portions of the current optimal solution. By modifying some of such new constraints associated with the variables to explain, we induce infeasibilities. Then, we reuse the Conflict Analyzer. Infeasible LP file Conflict file Conflict analyzer Feasible LP file Reasons file LP file Solution file Enforce current optimal solution Induce infeasibility Optimization proxies Long-term Sensitivity Analysis Beneficial to estimate the possible impact in the results of variations in the inputs. The whole idea is to move the computation efforts to an offline environment and reuse them on an online setting.
