Tanim [b] A key step limiting how fast batteries can be deployed is the time necessary to provide eval ation and validation of perform- ance. Using data analysis approaches, s ch as machine learning, the validation process can be accelerated. However, q estions on the validity of projecting models trained on limited data or simple cycling profiles, s ch as constant c rrent cycling, to real- world scenarios with complex loads remains. Here, we present the ability to predict performance with less than 1.2 % mean absol te percent error when trained on cells aged sing complex electric vehicle discharge profiles, and either AC Level 2 charge or DC Fast charge profiles, sing only the first 45 cycles, namely 5 % of the total testing time. While error is low across the projections, this st dy also highlights that battery lifetime analysis sing only cycling data may not extrapolate safely to certain real-world conditions d e to the impact of calendar degradation. In roduc ion The tility of Li-ion batteries contin es to evolve. This evol tion is driven by trifold advances in life, increased energy content and red ced cost.[1–3] While cell-level performance has distinctly improved, methods to nderstand cell degradation thro gho t life are still emerging. In some applications s ch as electric vehicles, there exist standard life and performance eval ation methods incl ding those employed by the United States Advanced Battery Consorti m. [4] In other areas, s ch as sta- tionary storage applications, a few proced res for common se cases s ch as peak shaving and freq ency reg lation have been implemented. [5] Where s ch methods have been estab- lished, life projection typically still req ires extensive data sets. For established chemistries and cell designs, it can take 6 to 9 months of aging data to develop s fficient battery life models. For new chemistries and cell designs, obtaining s fficient test data for life estimation can take well over a year and req ire large experimental designs.[6,7] The extended time needed for life eval ations can lengthen the technology development process and s bseq ently the deployment of new systems.

Advanced methods for analysis of battery performance provide the opport nity to significantly shorten the time needed to make predictions abo t cell performance. Indeed, recent work has shown high fidelity predictions sing as few as 100 cycles to achieve life prediction that varied from exper- imental res lts by less than 10 percent.[8] Aligning advanced data analysis with physical meaning is more diffic lt, as battery aging is a complex phenomenon that res lt from diverse physical and chemical mechanisms. [9] In part this can be linked to the fact that there is no “ niversal” physics-based life model. Life models and prediction techniq es can s ally be gro ped into either data-driven empirical models or physics- based models.[6,7,10–17] Physics-based models need to span many different length scales to f lly encaps late specific electro- chemical signat res that are linked to battery performance.[17–19] Empirical data-driven models are typically not directly tied to physical mechanisms, as s ch they often do an incomplete job in separating different aging factors, [9] incl ding those linked to both cycle and calendar aging. [20] This work looks to bridge some of the gaps between life models and advanced statistical methods that can be applied to predict performance at different points in life. In doing so, the work looks to better align physical models with experiments targeting specific feat res linked to materials and cell performance.[18,21] However, battery aging data comes in m ltiple dimensions, e. g., per cell, per cycle, and per factor, that makes it diffic lt for application of approaches based on l mped data val es. Th s, rather than sing s mmary statistics data that capt re sing lar val es for cycles, mean val es, or intermittent data collected d ring reference performance tests (RPTs), here an approaching sing physically-targeted, transient time series data is sed to train models.

It first estimates the lower dimension representation of each time series per cell that may then be sed to predict performance for varied se scenarios per cell. Similar methods have recently been sed to shorten the time needed for classification of fail re modes sing as few as 25 cycles.[22] As more vehicles with fast charge capabilities become available it is increasingly likely that se profiles will incorpo- rate an intermittent mix of both fast and slow charging.[23–26] Charging scenarios which have intermittent se vary drastically from most standard testing scenarios and can create complica- tions when predicting life. As described here, sing the combination of s mmary and transient time series data provides the opport nity to predict performance sing less than 50 cycles for an assortment of different charging conditions.

Resul s Cell agi g protocols a d data extractio . The majority of cells analyzed here were eval ated as described in Tanim et al.[27] Briefly, 24 graphite/lithi m manganese oxide-based po ch cells (33.1 Ah) were obtained from a Nissan Leaf battery pack. These cells were cycled sing Maccor 4000 series testers sing fo r different charge profile variants incl ding AC Level 2 (ACL2), DC Fast Charge (DCFC), delayed DCFC, and a combined ACL2 and DCFC charging protocols, as shown in Fig re 1. Detailed description abo t the charging protocols and testing temper- at res can be fo nd in the experimental section. All cells were periodically eval ated sing an RPT at 30 °C. The RPTs were performed every 32 days (96 cycles). The RPT incl ded hybrid p lse power characterization (HPPC) and C/3 charge-discharge cycle between 4.2 V and 2.5 V. In addition to capt ring electro- chemical data, the temperat re for each cell was acq ired thro gho t the co rse of the testing. Cells were fixt red sing Al plates (~ 30 kPa) to enhance thermal niformity d ring cycling.

Lastly, data acq isition according to conditions of convenience which do not req ire significant secondary processing allow for ready analyses of aging trends since they are not constrained by large lapses in time between data events as seen for RPTs. For the c rrent work, partic lar interest has been paid to the charging data. To facilitate prediction sing the machine learning algorithms, data points for each cell were extracted on a cycle- by-cycle basis. The respective data points extracted incl ded the temperat re (T) at the end of each constant power (CP) Figure 1. Charge protocol variants sing (a) ACL2 charging, (b) DCFC charging with the rest at the top of charge (c) delayed DCFC with the rest at a low state of charge (denoted as the delayed DCFC profile), and (d) mixed se of DCFC and ACL2 (denoted as the mixed profile). component of the charge, the Ah co nt at the end of each CP charge component (QCP), and the voltage at the end of each post-charge rest period (EOCV). These metrics reflect aspects of cell aging trends, as shown in Fig re 2, that can provide indication of the state of the battery electrodes and aging processes witho t the need for significant data red ction.

To ens re training and test data sets, the res lts from the vario s test conditions were split into two gro ps. Both the ACL2 and DCFC data sets (Fig res 3a and 3b, respectively) were sed for training p rposes, where specific elements from the charge profiles were extracted to highlight key physical feat res related to cell degradation processes. As shown previo sly, the dominant aging factors for both DCFC and ACL2 cells are loss of lithi m inventory (LLI) and loss of active material at the negative electrode (LAMLiNE).[27] While the RPT data as provided in Fig re 3 is val able for predictions, the addition of coarse data from each cycle provides enhanced opport nity to capt re physically linked processes.

From vis al inspection, it is apparent that EOCV and Qcp have a significant trend with respect to the cycle n mber where a combination of s mmary statistics will not s ffice in describing the trend. However, the T val e co ld be described as a random trend with respect to minor environ- mental chamber fl ct ations. For each of the extracted val es, the predictor variable is tested for any individ al o tlier information within the series as described below and in the statistical methodology section in the Experimental Proced res. If a potential o tlier is flagged, then linear interpolation is applied between the nearest data points and the interpolated point replaces the individ al point. It sho ld be noted that this techniq e is not intended for determining if gro ps of o tliers exist and may be improved pon in f t re work. The training data consists of a total of 18 different cells that are eq ally split into gro ps sing either the ACL2 or DCFC charging profile, as showed in Table 4 in the experimental section. The hold-o t validation s bset is never sed in the b ilding of the training model. The validation dataset incl des a total of six cells; three delayed DCFC charging profiles and three mixed ACL2/DCFC profiles. The training of the model only leverages a maxim m of 96 cycles contained within the first DST cycle set for the prediction of the final RPT capacity. The final predictor matrix, X, consists of the mean T, mean EOCV, mean QCP, the CV time, and the a to regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) coefficients for the EOCV and the Qcp to f lly describe the trend with respect to cycle n mber.

Table 1 describes the mean of the coefficients for each different charging protocol s bgro p. Notably, the ACL2/ DCFC combination protocol exhibits a strong exponential effect in the QCP compared to the rest of the s bgro ps. As this s bgro p will be part of the validation set, this co ld potentially make the prediction of the final RPT val es diffic lt. Within the ACL2, DCFC and delayed DCFC gro ps, the AR coefficients for the QCP reveals that the DCFC charge has the largest exponential effect followed by the delayed DCFC and ACL2. Combining cell data and then performing hierarchical cl stering can give some a priori knowledge of the different individ al cell behavior, as shown in Fig re 4. Each branch in Fig re 4 is an individ al cell (as labeled in Table 1) where the height indicates the distance between cl sters. Three different notable o tcomes are obtained from the cl stering analysis. First, the left-most cl ster is composed of cells with a short CV time. As s ch, the CV time m st be considered as a variable within the RPT regression even tho gh it does not relate to the degradation to the cell. Second, all ACL2 cells are in the largest right-hand cl ster. While some of the ACL2 cells are cl stered very closely together (Cell 02, 03, 04, 06, 09), the other 4 are Table 1. ARIMA coefficients for the different se cases, showing the AR and MA components.

For the ACL2 cells in these cl sters there is no obvio s relationship between testing temperat re and the cl stering, indicating that the lifetime of these cells may be diffic lt to predict in training. Lastly, all cells that nderwent DCFC at T > 20 °C, incl ding DCFC, delayed DCFC, and mixed DCFC/ACL2, are located in the middle cl ster. This indicates that the se of fast charging impacts cell degradation and is a dominant contrib tion to overall degrada- tion. Th s, even for variations in d ty cycle, the application of adaptive Least Absol te Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) sho ld provide a reasonable prediction. As s ch, this type of approach may be sed in early testing of cells to determine if a new cell is within the training data set sample space. If o tside the space, it is feasible to adapt the experi- ment design to acco nt for the variation in cell design or d ty cycle. Predictio of RPT capacity. The prediction of the RPT capacity m st first be compared against the set of potential regression res lts with increasing ass mptions on the linear model. Table 2 displays the prediction res lts of the standard ordinary least sq ares (OLS) sol tion, generalized LASSO and the generalized adaptive LASSO. This relative change in the standard OLS sol tion, compared to the generalized LASSO techniq es in the validation dataset, describes the req irement that the capacity m st be related to the T, Qcp and EOCV. The correlation is an exponential relationship as described by the physics and modeled here sing the ARIMA approach. F rthermore, the additional ability of adaptive LASSO to consistently select the appropriate variables f rther red ces the validation error when compared to LASSO. Fig re 5 compares Figure 4. Cl ster dendrogram for each of the cell ses eval ated. Each branch is a given cell n mber, and the height indicates the distance between cl sters. Cl stering can clearly identify cells with different aging and test considerations.

Discussion Effect of differe t umber of DST cycles i RPT capacity predictio . With the appropriate regression model chosen as the generalized adaptive LASSO, the RPT capacity prediction may be compared over different n mber of DST cycles in training and different RPT cycle co nts in validation. This determines the effects of the prediction model when sing a limited n mber of cycles and provides insight into the total amo nt of experiment time req ired to make acc rate lifetime predictions. Table 3 displays the MAPE according to how many DST cycles were sed in the training of the model when Table 3. Training and validation MAPE val es for predicting RPT capacity at 864 cycle sing only the first 10, 45, and 96 DST cycles. 10 DST cycles 45 DST cycles 96 DST cycles Training MAPE 0.28 % 0.23 % 0.31 % Validation MAPE 1.06 % 0.43 % 0.41 % predicting the RPT capacity at 864 cycles. The training error is similar, regardless of the n mber of DST cycles sed. However, the predictions sing 45 DST cycles and 96 DST cycles res lted in approximately half of the validation error compared to sing only 10 DST cycles. As s ch, a balance of the training and validation error m st be considered to determine if overfitting is occ rring. For example, the 10 and 45 DST cycle models may be overfitting the training data res lting in poor performance in validation. The validation sets sed variants of the cycling proced res sed in the training sets by either changing the state of charge (SOC) at which the cells rested, or by sing a combination of DCFC and ACL2 charging. While the cycling regimes were different, sing the more standard cycling profiles in the training sets still enabled good prediction with the average MAPE across both validation sets remaining below 0.5 %. These low MAPE val es show the tility of sing the adaptive LASSO method to perform predictions on data sets that encaps late charge proced res not directly involved in data training. This is vital in the long-term prediction of performance as lab-based testing often varies distinctly from act al deployed se cases. Fig re 6 shows the variation of the RPT capacity MAPE for all cells (training and validation) for each of the models sing only the first 10, 45, and 96 DST cycles.

The predicted RPT capacity was extrapolated to vario s cycle co nts across 100 to 864 cycles as 9 individ al RPTs. which point the model trained on only the first 10 cycles begins to perform worse. Th s, while short-term degradation behavior can be safely extrapolated from only the first 10 cycles (~ 3 days) of testing, the long-term degradation behavior cannot be inferred ntil sometime between the 10th and 45th cycles. This corroborates some of the findings from Severson et al., [8] which req ired approximately 60 cycles for model conver- gence, despite large differences in the cell chemistry, cell format, and testing protocol. This hints at a more general concl sion that battery lifetime may be acc rately predicted from early life (< 10 % of total lifetime) regardless of cell chemistry or size. When considering the variation in cell behavior and the convolved effects of beginning-of-life and long-term degradation modes, some threshold n mber of cycles needs to be met before acc rate long-term predictions can be made. In practice, the total n mber of DST cycles may be adj sted for the optimization of the cost of experiment compared to the error of the RPT capacity predictions. In addition to the experimental reso rces needed, there is also a need to nderstand the comp tational reso rces req ired for different analyses. Here, the comp tation time of b ilding the prediction model with the largest cycle co nt and over the 9 different RPT responses took a maxim m and average comp tation time of 1.036 and 0.834 seconds, respec- tively. This was performed on a 2.5 GHz Intel Core I7 witho t parallelization. This comp tation time may be decreased thro gh parallelization of the ARIMA component per cell. As s ch, the proposed methodology does not rely on significant comp ting reso rces and large n mber of samples that may be req ired in other machine learning techniq es s ch as deep ne ral networks. Predictio error a d possible cale dar agi g effects. While the variations are minor, differences between prediction and observed variations (Fig re 7) s ggest that while the overall MAPE is low, the over or nder prediction of RPT capacity appears to have a trend with respect to aging of the cell not distinctly related to the active cycling. As an example, when comparing both the DCFC and delayed DCFC cells at 30 °C, the prediction goes from slightly over predicting the RPT capacity fade to nderpredicting the fade for the delayed DCFC condition. To f rther nderstand the significance of this observation a t-test was performed on the prediction percent error of RPTs 1–5 and RPTs 7–9 for the two conditions. In performing the test, a p-val e of 0.002 is obtained indicating there is a statistically valid difference between the predictions Figure 7. Percent error of the predicted capacity from RPT 7, 8, and 9 (at 672, 768, and 864 cycles) for cells 13–15 (DCFC, 30 °C) and 19–21 (delayed DCFC, 30 °C). There is a progressive transition to a more negative percent error between the predicted vers s the act al experimental observations in the Delayed DCFC dataset, as indicated by the black arrows.

In Fig re 7, for the DCFC cells at 30 °C (Cell 13, 14, and 15), there is a relatively random distrib tion of error when moving from RPT 7 to RPT 9. However, for the delayed DCFC cells at 30 °C (Cell 19, 20, and 21), there is a progressive transition to a more negative percent error between the predicted and act al experimental observations, as indicated by the arrows in Fig re 7. This trend toward a larger negative percent error is indicative of a progressively worse nderprediction in RPT capacity (overprediction of the capacity fade) as this set of cells age. A pla sible explanation for the distinct trending in the delayed DCFC cells b t not in the DCFC cells at 30 ° C is that the c rrent framework does not f lly capt re degradation d e to calendar aging. All cells in the training set are held at 100 % SOC between cycles, while cells in the validation set are held for long times at 25 % SOC, which sho ld lead to greater calendar aging in the training set than in the validation set. D ring the first 6 RPTs, the impact from this difference in the calendar degradation rate was less prominent. However, d ring the last 3 months of the cycling experiment between RPT 7–9, the red ced stress from sitting at a lower SOC led to a progressive overprediction of the capacity fade. The modeling framework presented here co ld likely acco nt for the impact of rest SOC on long-term degradation if the rest SOC was varied within the training set. Creating a more rob st prediction will req ire more direct acco nting, especially for LLI, as LLI associated with SEI growth is known to vary distinctly with EOC and T.[14,31] Note that while the trend of increased error d ring later RPTs for the delayed DCFC is clearly visible, the adaptive LASSO approach still predicts the overall fade within ~ 1 % percent error. This low level of error holds tr e even nder the sit ation that different cycling regimes and calendar aging conditions between the training and validation sets For short or intermediate length estimates of life, this level of error wo ld minimally impact prediction p rposes. However, as pointed o t recently by Gasper et al., even small prediction errors can lead to sizeable variation when projecting to the 10 + year life need for most a tomotive and stationary applications.[14] Th s, f t re work needs to more effectively capt re aspects related to calendar aging variations, and to validate model predictions or pdate model parameters with real-world, long-term data whenever possible. Conclusion In this work, we sed a hierarchal machine learning approach to predict cell performance to the later stages of cell life for mixed se profiles. A training set of cells that nderwent either ACL2 or DCFC cycling was sed to predict the discharge capacity of delayed DCFC and mixed DCFC/ACL2 at cycle 864 (RPT 9) to within 1.2 % error sing only the first 45 cycles (~ 5 % of total test time). These res lts show the possibility for high fidelity prediction of performance for non-standard cycling conditions sing common cycling test sets. The res lts also show that, while the prediction in cycle life is enco raging, there is a progressively worse nderprediction in RPT capacity for the delayed DCFC cells which spent a more significant period of time at low SOC. This is significant as predicting performance for a battery system that may need a 10 + year performance life sing models relying solely on cycling cells may be problematic. As approaches s ch as the one presented here advance, the need to encaps late combinations of calendar and cycle life fade more f lly will be needed. Ultimately, this method will accelerate the transitioning from development to deployment when integrating new battery technologies or deploying battery systems to new se cases.

Regardless of charging method each condition was limited to three charging and discharging events per day. All tests were performed in environmental chambers controlled to � 1 °C of the set-point for each condition. The respective charging profiles were scaled to the cell level from pack level val es of 3.3 kW for ACL2 and 50 kW for DCFC. In the case of ACL2 charging a constant power (CP) of Table 4.

For the DCFC, a CP of 260.4 W was applied ntil the voltage reached 4.11 V. As with the ACL2 charge a CV step at 4.11 V of 60 min or ntil a C/20 charge c rrent was met followed the CP charge portion. Discharge was accomplished sing a dynamic stress test (DST) discharge with a peak discharge power of 250 W, as described in the USABC Battery Test Man al for Electric Vehicles.[4] For this work one DST discharge cycle eq ated to the net removal of 74.35 Wh. To provide three cycles per day for each condition, tests were constr cted so that the total time for each charge pl s post charge rest was kept constant. Similarly, the total time for each discharge pl s post discharge rest was maintained over the co rse of the cycling experiment. The total charge + rest and discharge + rest for each protocol are given in Table 4. Keeping a constant time for the combined charge or discharge and rest was sed to acco nt for capacity fade as the cells age. Keeping j st the rest constant wo ld have progressively lead to more cycles per day. All cells were periodically eval ated sing an RPT at 30 °C. The RPTs were performed every 32 days (96 cycles). The RPT incl ded hybrid p lse power characterization (HPPC) and C/3 charge-discharge cycle between 4.2 V and 2.5 V. In addition to capt ring electro- chemical data, the temperat re for each cell was acq ired thro gho t the co rse of the testing. Cells were fixt red sing Al plates (6.35-mm, ~ 30 kPa) to enhance thermal niformity d ring cycling. [28] S a is ical Me hodology Dime sio reductio via time series a alysis. From the collected set of data, an objective was established to predict the end state RPT capacity solely based on the first 10 to 96 DST cycles. This eq ates to predictions sing the first 1 %–10 % of the test data. The f ll eval ation period for these cells was 10 months. Setting the data constraints in this manner allows for early estimates of battery performance for niq e se profiles, at a f t re time. The data constraints also provide a red ction in costs and time associated with validation. As s ch, the prediction of the RPT capacity may be described as a s pervised learning problem with two time series variables, EOCV and Qcp, as predictors over a series of cycles that are infl enced by noise, o tliers, and missing information. T is excl ded as a time series, as it typically varies randomly aro nd the set experimental T. To acco nt for any o tlier and noise iss es, the data was passed thro gh a set of statistical preprocessing steps. To set the prediction of the RPT capacity problem in a mathematical framework, let y be a vector of RPT capacity val es after 864 DST cycles. Let X be a matrix of a set of predictor variables incl ding the EOCV polarization, Qcp and T effects for each cell. The addition of the cycle information for these variables creates a tensor str ct re where the predictors are within three dimensions rather than the matrix str ct re req ired for most machine learning algorithms. More concretely, this problem can be stated as: y 2 Rn�1 c 2 R n�m�c; (1) where y is the set of RPT capacity meas rements for n cells and c are the extracted DST val es associated with m variables (EOCV, Qcp, and T) within c n mber of cycles. In contrast, the standard ordinary least sq ares (OLS) regression model is in the form of: y ¼ Xb þ e (2) and is solved as: min k y Xbk 2 2 b (3) where b are the regression coefficients, e is a vector of independ- ent and identical normally distrib ted error and X is a matrix of predictors. While methods c rrently exist for the application of tensor regression, interpretability with respect to the mechanism [32–34] Here wemay be lost and is o tside the scope of this paper. first disc ss dealing with the tensor str ct re as a dimension red ction problem. The goal is to explain the maximal amo nt of variance within the DST cycling in a condensed manner, while leveraging the stochastic nat re of the data. Then statistical preprocessing techniq es are applied to determine if any o tliers exist within cycles and between cells. Finally, generalized penalized regression techniq es are applied to acco nt for variables that may be nimportant in the capacity prediction and describe the physic- based dependence. The combination of each step provides a framework for the acc rate prediction of the RPT capacity at a given n mber of cycles. ARIMA model describe the tre ds of Qcp, EOCV, a d T. As noted above, to red ce the dimension of the DST information in a conformable manner, the QCP and EOCV with respect to cycle n mber is treated as a time series of information. As s ch, the predictors in a single cell deviate with respect to time, i. e. cycle n mbers, based on the previo s time points and a change in the mean val es. For example, Fig re 2 describes the variation of the recorded Qcp, EOCV, and T for each cycle n mber of a cell (Cell 03) in the first 96 cycles of the cycling test. Vis ally, the rate of change of the EOCV and QCP trends is based on previo s time points and co ld be leveraged to describe the whole series, while the T varies randomly aro nd the mean. These three variables, as time series, can be described sing the a to regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series model, which is a mathematical method for meas ring the dependence of a series on previo s time points. [35,36] The ARIMA model is composed of three distinct parts: a toregressive (AR) component explaining the reliance of the c rrent time val e on a previo s lag, non-stationarity integrated (I) ens ring the mean of the series does not depend on time, and moving average (MA) component describing how m ch the white noise changes over lag points. More concretely, let xt be one of the predictor variables with respect to cycle n mber and w designate the noise, then the ARIMA model decomposes the time series into the following components: * A toregressive xt ¼ ¢i 1xt 1 þ þ ¢t pxt p þ wt (4) * Integrated x 0 ¼ xt xt (5)t 1 * Moving Average xt ¼ qt 1wt 1 þ þ qt qwt q (6) where ¢ and q are regression coefficients for each lag respective to the a toregressive and moving average components. Based on the previo s example in Fig re 2, the QCP and the EOCV effects will be heavily affected by all three ARIMA components as the degradation of the battery as the mean of the series depends on time and has an nderlying monotonic decreasing effect. The T exhibit polarized random fl ct ations with a constant mean between cycles based on minimal fl ct ations in the environmental chamber control.

[37,38] For each predictor, the time series can be red ced to a small set of coefficients, i. e. p and q, based on the a toregressive and moving average components. The total n mber of lags sed for each p and q given the same order of differencing are determined thro gh the se of the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC/BIC) providing an optimal model fit based on the tradeoff of the error and the total n mber of variables in the model. [39,40] Outlier detectio . One key ass mption to the se of machine learning in general is that there does not exist o tliers that will have significant impact on the model. The presence of o tliers will res lt in misleading predictions of the response. The DST cycle information m st be pre-processed in way to a tomatically flag potential o tliers within each cycling series and to determine if the cells are consistent within the sample set given. The more rob st training set given in the prod ction of the model will dictate the ability to predict f t re samples. Missing information within the individ al cycling of the EOCV and QCP is a non-iss e as the ARIMA coefficients that describe the series are sed as a s rrogate in the regression model. However, those coefficients may still be infl enced by the o tliers within the cycling series. A variety of proven time series o tlier detection algorithms exist in method- ology and code implementation for the detection of individ al and gro ps of o tliers.[41–43] In this st dy, we se the simple yet effective a tomatic estimation of an o tlier thro gh the likelihood ratio test of the st dentized resid als of the fit ARIMA model.[44] As s ch, if there exists a data point that is significantly different from the resid al distrib tion, this data point can be flagged as an o tlier. Following from the correction of individ al cycle information, the set of ARIMA coefficients derived from the DST per cell m st then be analyzed for potential o tliers for the event al prediction of the RPT capacity. This information may incl de individ al or gro ps of o tliers, where the se of analysis on the st dentized resid als may fail to detect. As s ch, common ns pervised screening methods, e. g. cl stering, may be sed to determine which samples are distinctly different from the whole space. Here, we apply hierarchical cl stering to meas re the similarity between each cell. [45] This method specifically ses a minimax distance as the linkage f nction which provides interpretable cl sters as well prototypical cells that best describe a given behavior or charging profile. Variable Selectio . With the red ction in dimension and detection of o tliers, we treat the coefficients obtained from each p and q as a predictor in the analysis of the final RPT val e where X 2 Rn × [4 + 2(p + q)] is now a matrix, i. e. the mean T, mean EOCV, mean Qcp, charge time and the a toregressive/moving average components for the Qcp and EOCV. With a small sample size of the n mber of cells, this still q ickly becomes a high dimensional problem with respect to the total n mber of predictors being greater than the total n mber of samples. This is a concern as the estimation of the regression coefficients β in Eq ation 3 relies on the inverse of XTX which is sing lar in high dimensions. Additionally, some of the variation capt red within each predictor obtained thro gh the ARIMA model may not have an impact on the final prediction of the RPT. Penalized least sq ares models extends the nat re of Eq ation 3 to acco nt for m lticollinearity between variables and variable selection by introd cing norm constraints on the regres- sion coefficients, i. e., min k y Xb k 2 þ l k bk 2 b 2 2 (7) where jj jj2 2 is the penalty on the regression coefficients in the linear model based on the t ning parameter λ. The specific form of Eq ation 4 refers to ridge regression (RR) where the regression coefficients are penalized by the 2-norm res lting in a red ction in variance of the coefficients and dealing with m lticollinearity between the predictors. [46] If the 2-norm is replaced by the 1-norm, i. e. the regression coefficients are penalized by the Manhattan distance rather than the E clidean distance, the res lt is Least Absol te Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression allowing for exact zeros in the coefficients for selection of the important predictors in the available set.[47] With the addition of another t ning parameter and the se of both norms, Eq ation 4 becomes the elastic-net model. [48] The t ning parameter controls the shrinkage of the regression coefficients for either red cing the variance or variable selection. For example, when λ is eq al to zero Eq ation 4 is j st the ordinary least sq ares model in Eq ation 3 and as the val e of lambda increases, the coefficients are shr nk towards zero. The optimization of λ is commonly performed sing k-fold cross validation where a set of samples are left o t as a validation set and the rest are sed to b ild the regression model. [49] This is repeated for each fold over a grid of λ val es where the selected λ is based on the minimization of the mean sq are error in predicting the validation set at each iteration. One drawback of LASSO is the selected predictors may vary based on the random nat re of the t ning parameter selection. This may ca se slight differences in the coefficients and the selection of predictors especially when highly correlated. Adaptive LASSO is an improvement to the original LASSO thro gh weighting the regression coefficients s ch that the variable selection is consistent. [50] This modifies Eq ation 4 to min k y Xb k 2 þ lwjbj1 b 2 (8) where w is a vector of weights for each regression coefficient. The val es of w are typically chosen as the transformation of the OLS regression coefficients or the ridge coefficients when the problem is high dimensional, i. e., 1 1 wb ¼ ; or (9)j jgjbOLSjg bRR where γ > 0. The additional step of calc lating the regression coefficients for OLS or RR req ires a two-step process b t is minimal in comp tation time for the benefit of providing consistent coefficient estimates. Ge eralized li ear models. Adaptive LASSO specifically highlights the important factors, and those that can be discarded, thro gh an optimized weight associated with the final capacity. However, this model can be enhanced thro gh the incl sion of the capacity physical interpretation in the ass mptions of the linear model. Two basic physical ass mptions are taken into acco nt with respect to the meas red factors: the nat ral log relationship with the capacity and the polynomial effects or interactions between each meas red factor. The former ass mption is addressed by incl ding interaction terms within the linear model, i. e., the element-wise m ltiplication of different factors as a new factor within the predictor matrix. For example, the interaction of T and EOCV may have a specific physical interpretation. In this way, the predictor matrix may be a gmented with each polynomial interaction term after the application of the ARIMA model while still holding a linear relationship with respect to the capacity. To handle the ass mption of the nat ral log relationship with the capacity, a transform m st take place on the capacity or the meas red factors.

This conflicts with one of the base ass mptions of the linear model where we expect the noise to be independent and identical normally distrib ted. As s ch, generalized linear models will be sed to extend the basic form of the objective f nction given in Eq ation 3. [51] The generalized linear model ses a link f nction g(μ) = Xβ to connect the mean of the response, μ, to the meas red factors. In this specific case, the link f nction is the nat ral log changing the original objective f nction to: k y g 1ðXbÞk2 2 (10) In this way, ass mptions are maintained with respect to the physical relationship of capacity and the linear model for acc rate estimates of the regression coefficients.
