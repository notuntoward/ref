ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Abstract This article is a response to Rao (2017), Krishna and Sokolova (2017), and Oyserman and Schwarz (2017), all of whom provided extremely thoughtful commentaries on a target article in which I summarized several lines of research in political psychology on liberal-conservative differences in personality, cognition, motivation, values, and neurological structures and functions (Jost, 2017a). I begin by correcting a possible misconception, namely that the theory of political ideology as motivated social cognition cannot explain dynamic shifts in ideological affinities; on the contrary, we have demonstrated that “top-down” situational—as well as “bottom-up” dispositional—processes work in conjunction to produce ideological outcomes, and this is why tailored forms of political persuasion can be highly effective in producing change. Next I describe additional evidence (including previously unpublished evidence) bearing on ideological symmetries and asymmetries with respect to emotion, partisanship, social identification, motivated reasoning, social network structure, and political trust. I end by asking consumer psychologists for their continued collaboration in addressing profound challenges associated with understanding and reconciling sources of ideological divergence— not only for the sake of research in behavioral science but also for the smooth functioning of democratic society. Keywords: political psychology, ideology, liberalism, conservatism, motivation ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT “Ideologies separate us. Dreams and anguish bring us together.” (Eugène Ionesco, 1958) Through this most collegial and constructive interdisciplinary exchange I am delighted to discover that scholarly interest in political psychology is even deeper and broader than I had anticipated among theorists and practitioners of consumer behavior. I want to first thank the editorial leadership of the Journal of Consumer Psychology—and especially Sharon Shavitt—for providing me with such a marvelous opportunity to interact in this way with a new and welcoming academic community. I am also extremely grateful to Akshay Rao, Aradhna Krishna, Tatiana Sokolova, Daphna Oyserman, and Norbert Schwarz for their thoughtful entreaties to expand the discussion of political ideology into neighboring territories, such as emotion, partisan identification, motivated reasoning, social network structure, and political trust. Before I jump into the empirical evidence bearing on these and related phenomena, please allow me to correct a possible misconception. Theoretical Clarification: The Integration of “Top-Down” and “Bottom-Up” Processes Although I agree with most of what Oyserman and Schwarz (2017) have written, they are mistaken to associate my theoretical perspective with the “essentialist belief” that people are “the same across time and space” (p. 4)—a perspective that, they argue, needs to be “counterbalanced by a consideration of immediate contextual variables influencing motivation, identities and attitudes” (p. 5). Rao (2017) arrived at a similar misreading, so I must not have been clear enough about my theoretical foundations in social psychology. He imagines that it is central to my perspective that “dyed-in-the wool-conservatives and progressives” are very much alike and, above all, “brand loyal.” (An earlier draft of suggested that I assumed ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ideological differences to be “immutable,” which is not at all the case). With all due respect to my esteemed commentators, these are caricatures of the position I sought to articulate, namely that—in contrast to the assumption that ordinary citizens are simply “non-ideological” (e.g., Kinder & Kalmoe, 2017)—there are a number of meaningful social, cognitive, and motivational differences associated with people who drawn to the left vs. right poles in the ideological sphere (Jost, 2017a, 2017b). From the start, my colleagues and I have emphasized that there are dynamic situational (or environmental) as well as fairly stable dispositional (or personality) determinants of political orientation (Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, & Sulloway, 2003). Inspired by the work of Silvan Tomkins (1963), we propose that ideology is a “love affair”—an “elective affinity”—between a person (who possesses a wide range of chronic and temporary needs, interests, and motivations) and a socially constructed, historically situated belief system that offers some opportunity for seduction. Thus, “top-down” processes of institutional socialization and communication, including exposure to messages from political elites (what Krishna and Sokolova [2017] refer to as “macro-level factors”) interact with “bottom-up” psychological (or “micro-level”) factors to produce matching (or resonant) ideological outcomes (Jost, Federico, & Napier, 2009). There is nothing “immutable” (or “invariant,” as Oyserman and Schwarz [2017) suggest) about these outcomes, and there is no non-tautological sense in which they may be said to spring from “essential differences” between liberal and conservative types of people. We have often pointed out, for instance, that education and travel experiences—which are powerful forces that can lead people to perceive that which is uncertain, unfamiliar, complex, and ambiguous not as threatening but as exciting or enjoyable—tend to make people ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT more open-minded, liberal, egalitarian, and interested in diversity (see Jost, Nosek, & Gosling, 2008). Conversely, exposure to highly threatening circumstances such as terrorist attacks, governmental warnings, and drastic shifts in racial demography often precipitate conservative shifts in political attitudes (e.g., Bonanno & Jost, 2006; Craig & Richeson, 2014; Schüller, 2015), presumably because feeling threatened elicits “motivated closed-mindedness” (Thόrisdottir & Jost, 2011). In a recent meta-analytic review we observed that in 22 of 34 studies exposure to objectively threatening stimuli significantly increased the attractiveness of conservative, right- wing ideas and opinions (Jost, Stern, Rule, & Sterling, 2017; see Figure 1). To paraphrase Ionesco, then, anguish may indeed supersede ideological differences—at least temporarily, for better and for worse. That is, terrorist attacks and other intense threats seem to increase consensus around conservative, patriotic, and authoritarian ways of thinking (e.g., Van de Vyver, Houston, Abrams, & Vasiljevic, 2016; van der Toorn, Nail, Liviatan, & Jost, 2014; Vasilopoulos, Marcus, & Foucault, 2017). These converging lines of research show that external situations or contexts can contribute to dynamic shifts in ideological affinities for internal, psychological reasons—such as increased activation of epistemic, existential, or relational motives. In this way, situation-specific processes are built into the model of political ideology of social cognition. Thus, I agree that political orientations are, among other things, “situated identities” (Oyserman & Schwarz, 2017) and that “segments are dynamic” and many people “transition from one state to the other because of changes in life-stage, the environment . . . and the like” (Rao, 2017, p. 16). Likewise, my perspective should not be taken to suggest that political persuasion of “micro-targets” through rational (or emotional) means is futile. I certainly agree with Rao (2017) ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT that ideological preferences may be “nudged,” and I applaud his own efforts in this regard (e.g., Kim, Rao, & Lee, 2009). And I concur with Oyserman and Schwarz (2017) that shifting the boundaries of social identification may be one especially fruitful way of promoting ideological change. Along these lines, my students and I have demonstrated that it is possible to increase support for environmental initiatives aimed at addressing anthropogenic climate change (Feygina, Jost, & Goldsmith, 2010) as well as the rights and liberties of Muslim Americans (Nam & Jost, 2014) by emphasizing ways in which these causes are congruent (rather than incongruent) with the preservation of American values and ideals. Interventions such as these seek to harness system justification motivation on behalf of social change rather than eliciting system-defensiveness. It may be that dreams, in other words, are capable of bringing us together as well. I alluded to some examples of political persuasion and situationally induced ideological shifts in the target article, but I probably should have made more explicit the fact that we regard ideological outcomes as shaped by environmental and contextual (“top-down”) as well personal and dispositional (“bottom-up”) factors. I am grateful for the opportunity to try to clear up misconceptions concerning the theoretical (and meta-theoretical) underpinnings of our research program on political ideology as motivated social cognition. More Evidence of Ideological Symmetries and Asymmetries Emotional Experiences Rao (2017) is on solid ground when he points out that there are important emotional differences between liberals and conservatives and that I said fairly little about these differences in my target article. I am pleased to have the opportunity to add a bit more now about the connection between ideology and emotion. It was Tomkins (1963) who first proposed that ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT leftists are preoccupied with hope, excitement, empathy, sadness, and guilt, whereas rightists are fixated on fear, anger, contempt, pessimism, disgust, and shame (i.e., self-disgust). Ideological differences in fear and disgust have been investigated rather thoroughly at this point (e.g., Jost et al., 2017; Terrizzi, Shook, & McDaniel, 2013), but research on most of the others has been patchy thus far. Nevertheless, the evidence that does exist is promising. Recent work suggests that anger, for instance, promotes social and economic forms of conservatism (Milburn & Conrad, 2016). A series of studies by Kettle and Salerno (2017) revealed that making people angrier had the effect of increasing their competition for material resources, and this led them to show stronger support for political candidates who were espousing conservative economic values. With respect to social conservatism, terrorist activity in France appears to have increased authoritarianism among right-wingers, and the effect was mediated by increased anger (Vasilopoulos et al., 2017). Finally, as noted by Krishna and Sokolova (2017), experiments conducted by Huber, Van Boven, Park, and Pizzi (2015) showed that inducing feelings of anger (vs. sadness) led Republicans—but not Democrats—to strengthen their perceptions of political conflict and polarization. Emotional Self-Regulation My own research with Ruthie Pliskin and Eran Halperin in Israel and the U.S. suggests that leftists and rightists differ not only in terms of emotional experiences but also in terms of their self-regulation goals. More specifically, we have found that rightists are more motivated than leftists to increase their own feelings of anger and fear when it comes to issues of immigration and electoral competition (Pliskin, Halperin, & Jost, 2017). Leftists, by contrast, are more motivated to increase feelings of hope in the context of the longstanding Arab-Israeli ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT conflict (Pliskin, Nabet, Jost, Tamir, & Halperin, 2017). These findings are broadly consistent with the notion that down-regulating negative emotions such as anger and disgust undermines support for conservative ideas and policies (Feinberg, Willer, Antonenko, & John, 2012; Lee, Sohn, & Fowler, 2013). Rao (2017) wonders whether emotional appeals based on nostalgia would be more successful on the left or right and mentions some preliminary support for the latter possibility (Lasaleta, Rao, & Kondaveeti, 2017).1 This question has also been addressed by Lammers and Baldwin (2017), who—based on the theory of political ideology as motivated social cognition (Jost et al., 2003)—reasoned that conservatives, by virtue of their stronger system-justifying tendencies and attachment to traditions arising from the status quo, would be more likely than liberals to be persuaded by nostalgic messages. With respect to a number of important issues (including gun control, climate change, and support for racial and ethnic diversity), Lammers and Baldwin have demonstrated that framing progressive messages in terms of past-oriented (as opposed to future-oriented) themes leads conservative (but not liberal) recipients to be less resistant to social change. Partisan Identification Krishna and Sokolova (2017) are absolutely right that—in addition to ideological differences between the left and right (Jost, 2017a, 2017b)—the social and political world is rife with partisan commitments arising from affiliation with political parties, such as the Democratic 1 Rao (2017) notes that—in research by Lasaleta, Rao and Kondaveeti (2017)—conservatives were found to be highly motivated to “belong to like-minded conservative-oriented groups and organizations” and that this desire to affiliate with like-minded others was greater among conservatives than liberals. It is worth pointing out that my colleagues and I have observed a very similar phenomenon, namely a stronger relational motivation to “share reality” with like-minded others among conservatives than liberals (Stern, West, Jost, & Rule, 2014). ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT and Republican parties. Oyserman and Schwarz (2017), too, underscore the role of identity- based motivations in political psychology and fact that these motivations may be highly sensitive to local, contextual factors. Thus, as Krishna and Sokolova note, it is possible (at least in principle, in some situations) to be a liberal Republican who advocates free public transportation for the elderly or a conservative Democrat who wants to lower property taxes. At the same time, it is clear that, as an empirical matter, the connection between partisan identification and liberal-conservative ideology has risen sharply over the past few decades. As a result, there are many fewer liberal-minded Republicans and conservative-minded Democrats than in earlier eras of American politics. In the mid-1970’s, the correlation between ideology and partisan identification ranged from r = .15 to .30 in adolescent and adult samples; it now hovers around r = .50 to .60 (Twenge, Honeycutt, Prislin, & Sherman, 2016, p. 1380). The strength of the correlation between partisanship and ideology is taken by political scientists to be an important sign that we are living through an especially polarized historical period (e.g., Abramowitz & Saunders, 2008). I readily acknowledge that political partisanship (or social identification with a political party) is not the same thing as ideology—although political parties are much more often than not ideological in key respects. I also agree that some of the effects of partisanship are symmetrical, in the sense that Democrats and Republicans are capable of acting in self-serving and group-serving ways that are more similar than dissimilar (e.g., Iyengar & Westwood, 2015; Jost, Hennes, & Lavine, 2013).2 At the same time, there are also a number of asymmetrical effects, 2 I share Rao’s (2017) concerns that drawing superficial parallels between conservatives and progressives may foster a sense of false equivalence when it comes to rates of embracing self-, group-, and system- serving “conclusions . . . of questionable veracity” (see also Jost, Hennes, & Lavine, 2013). I would, for ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT that is, ways in which the behavior of Democrats and Republicans is qualitatively different— and these are highly consistent with the account of ideological differences that I provided in the target article (Jost, 2017a; see also Jost, 2017b). As Krishna and Sokolova (2017) point out, registered Democrats have long outnumbered Republicans in the U.S., and yet Republicans do as well (if not better) than Democrats at election time. This implies that Democrats are more willing to vote for Republicans than vice versa or—as Rao (2017) would say—Democrats are more likely to be “brand switchers” than Republicans. Indeed, this is part of a much broader pattern of asymmetry. Evidence is accumulating rapidly in political science that Republicans are more intensely ideological—and cohesive, in terms of unity, strength, and single-mindedness of purpose—in comparison with Democrats (Abramowitz, 2015; Grossmann & Hopkins, 2016; Hacker & Pierson, 2006; Mann & Ornstein, 2012). Thus, the increasing political polarization in American society is largely attributable to the fact that Republicans have grown more extreme, while Democrats have largely stayed the same (Barber & McCarty, 2013; McCarty, Poole, Rosenthal, & Hare, 2012). Mann and Ornstein (2012) conclude that: “one of the two major parties, the Republican Party, has become an insurgent outlier—ideologically extreme; contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime; scornful of compromise; unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence, and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition” (p. xiv). I submit that political psychology has something to say about why this is the case: there are, in other words, “bottom-up” as well as that very reason, question his emphasis on the concept of “tribalism” and his choice of metaphor of Capulets and Montagues from Romeo and Juliet. In this response I summarize even more evidence that the extent of partisan bias (or “tribal” behavior) is highly asymmetrical, at least when it comes to the left and right in American politics—and in some other countries as well. ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT “top-down” factors at play. Motivated Reasoning On the topic of motivated reasoning, Krishna and Sokolova (2017) recount Cohen’s (2003) experiments involving college students, which suggested that Democrats and Republicans were equally susceptible to partisan biases with respect to policy preferences. In these studies, participants were generally supportive of policies that they believed were proposed by members of their own political party and rejecting of policies that they believed were proposed by members of the opposing party. Cohen concluded on the basis of these results that partisanship outweighed philosophical (or ideological) concerns and that partisan bias was a symmetrical phenomenon exhibited by Democrats and Republicans alike. Before accepting these conclusions, however, one should ponder the results of a parallel set of experiments conducted by Bullock (2011), which were based on larger and more representative samples of adult partisans. These studies revealed that Republicans were significantly more influenced by partisan cues, in comparison with Democrats. Conversely, Democrats were more attentive than Republicans to substantive information about policy content. Krishna and Sokolova (2017) also cite research by Sen (2017), which found that Republicans were more sensitive than Democrats to partisan cues when asked to evaluate judicial candidates. Taken in conjunction, these results are consistent with Krishna and Sokolova’s (2017) argument that systematic (vs. heuristic) processing of information attenuates the influence of partisan cues—as well as the observation that liberals are more likely than conservatives to engage in systematic processing (Jost, 2017a, 2017b). Social Network Structure ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Krishna and Sokolova (2017) argue that homogenous social networks may exacerbate partisan biases by limiting exposure to novel and contradictory information and encouraging heuristic (as opposed to systematic) forms of reasoning. It should be of interest, then, that research on social media suggests that conservatives may be more likely than liberals to favor an “echo-chamber” type of informational environment. Boutyline and Willer (2017), for instance, observed in a study of over 260,000 Twitter users that more conservative users, such as followers of the Cato Institute, tended to have more homogenous online networks than liberal users, such as followers of Amnesty International. Findings such as these call into question the common assumption that those on the left and right are equally tempted to avoid contradictory points of view by engaging in selective information exposure (e.g., Frimer, Skitka, & Motyl, 2017). Barberá, Jost, Nagler, Tucker, and Bonneau (2015) estimated the ideological positions of 3.8 million Twitter users and—drawing on a dataset of 150 million tweets pertaining to 12 political and non-political issues—compared rates of cross-ideological retweeting, that is, the tendency for liberals to forward messages written by conservatives (and vice versa). For 11 of the 12 issues, we observed that liberals were in fact more likely than conservatives to engage in cross-ideological dissemination of information (see Figure 2). Although one cannot infer on the basis of retweeting behavior that liberals approved of messages written by conservatives, the evidence suggests that liberals were more likely than conservatives to expose themselves to messages from the other “side” and, indeed, to pass them on to others members of their social networks. A number of other investigations lead to the virtually inescapable conclusion that, at least during the present historical period, liberals are less enamored than conservatives of ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT informational environments that are biased, polarized, conspiratorial, and otherwise riddled with false or misleading statements (Benkler, Faris, Roberts, & Zuckerman, 2017; Cherry, 2017; Hjorth & Adler-Nissen, 2017; Marwick & Lewis, 2017; Miller, Saunders, & Farhart, 2015). Political Trust and its Implications for Democratic Functioning The legitimacy and stability of democratic systems depend, in crucial respects, upon some degree of political trust and a certain readiness on the part of citizens to accept the will of the majority and, if necessary, to place the public good above partisan interests. Recently, however, political scientists have worried that the erosion of democratic norms has led to a situation in which “partisans whose party is out of power have almost no trust at all in a government run by the other side” (Hetherington & Rudolph, 2015, p. 1). Consistent with all of the other ideological asymmetries that I have been describing, my colleagues and I have found that conservatives and Republicans are more likely than liberals and Democrats to trust the government more when it is led by a chief executive who shares their own ideological orientation than when it is not (see Figure 3) More specifically, Morisi, Singh, and Jost (2017) analyzed several decades’ worth of data from the American National Election Studies (ANES), General Social Survey (GSS), and European Social Survey (ESS) and discovered that citizens on the right trust the government and national parliament more when the leader of the government shares their own ideology, and they do so more than citizens on the left. Conversely, leftists are more willing to grant legitimacy to governments led by rightists than vice versa. This ideological asymmetry also applies to otherwise ostensibly principled stances on “small” or “limited government.” We find that conservatives are, in fact, much more approving of governmental intervention when there ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT is a like-minded executive in office than when there is not, but liberals do not exhibit the same double-standard. These findings suggest a number of worrying implications about democratic functioning, including the possibility that conservative intransigence provides a systematic advantage in electoral politics, because liberal governments, even after they are elected, may find it more difficult than conservative governments to maintain popular consent. As Mann and Ornstein (2012) point out, the stage is thereby set for “dysfunctional politics,” insofar as significant ideological asymmetries such as this one make it “extremely difficult to enact policies responsive to the country’s most pressing challenges” (p. xiv.). Concluding Remarks In a target article I sought to provide an integrative summary of several independent lines of empirical research revealing that liberals and conservatives differ in terms of personality characteristics, cognitive processing styles, motivational concerns, personal values, and neurological structures and physiological functions (Jost, 2017a). I am delighted to learn from Rao (2017), Krishna and Sokolova (2017), and Oyserman and Schwarz (2017) that this work is of genuine interest—as I had hoped—to scholars in consumer psychology. In this reply, I have sought to take seriously my commentators’ myriad interests in emotion, partisanship, social identification, motivated reasoning, social network structure, and political trust and to provide additional evidence (including previously unpublished evidence) of left-right symmetries and asymmetries pertaining to each of these phenomena. Once again, I wish to thank my esteemed commentators for sharing their creative, constructive, and insightful perspectives with me. As I hope to have conveyed here, the challenges of understanding and reconciling the sources of ideological divergence are profound ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT indeed—not only for research in the social and behavioral sciences but also for the smooth functioning of democratic society. My sense is that we need to work together in both of these areas, and I would very much like to count on your continued collaboration. References Abramowitz, A.I. (2015).

Aggregating across these studies, the unweighted (r = .14) and weighted (r = .07) average effect sizes indicated that exposure to objectively threatening circumstances was associated with conservative preferences, although the effect size was modest. ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Figure 2: Cross-Ideological Retweeting Rates: Liberals Were More Likely to Forward Twitter Messages Written by Conservatives than Vice Versa for 11 out of 12 Political and Nonpolitical Topics Note: This figure, which was prepared by Pablo Barberá, is adapted from Barberá, Jost, Nagler, Tucker, and Bonneau (2015). Each point represents an exponentiated coefficient of a Poisson regression for each topic and ideological group. The lines indicate confidence intervals at the 99.9% level, some of which are invisible because of the extremely large sample sizes in terms of tweets. The dashed vertical line corresponds to a value of 1, which would indicate identical retweeting rates for individuals of the same vs. different ideological orientations. ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Figure 3: An Ideological Asymmetry in Political Trust: Conservatives and Rightists Exhibit Stronger Tendencies than Liberals and Leftists in the U.S. and Europe to Trust the Government More When It is Led by a Chief Executive Who Shares Their Ideology (vs. Not) Note: This figure, which was prepared by Davide Morisi, is adapted from Morisi, Singh, and Jost (2017, Figures 2 and 5). It illustrates average marginal effects of a president/prime minister with a similar ideology on trust in the government, relative to a president with a different ideology (value 0 on Y-axis) with 95% confidence intervals.
