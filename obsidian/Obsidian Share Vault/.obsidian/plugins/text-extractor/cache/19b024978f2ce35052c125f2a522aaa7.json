This study introduces a Physics-27 based Smart Persistence model for Intra-hour forecasting of solar radiation (PSPI) that decomposes 28 the forecasting of GHI into the computation of extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar zenith angle 29 and the forecasting of cloud albedo and cloud fraction. The extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar 30 zenith angle are accurately computed by the Solar Position Algorithm (SPA) developed at the 31 National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). A cloud retrieval technique is used to estimate 32 cloud albedo and cloud fraction from surface-based observations of GHI. With the assumption of 33 persistent cloud structures, the cloud albedo and cloud fraction are predicted for future time steps 34 using a two-stream approximation and a 5-minute exponential weighted moving average, 35 respectively. Our model evaluation using the long-term observations of GHI at NREL’s Solar 36 Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL) shows that the PSPI has a better performance than the 37 persistence and smart persistence models in all forecast time horizons between 5 and 60 minutes, 38 which is more significant in cloudy-sky conditions. Compared to the persistence and smart 39 persistence models, the PSPI does not require additional observations of various atmospheric 40 parameters but is customizable in that additional observations, if available, can be ingested to 41 further improve the GHI forecast. An advanced technology of cloud forecast is also expected to 42 improve the future performance of the PSPI. 43 44 45 46 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript.

Introduction 49 Accurate forecasting of solar resource and photovoltaic (PV) power production has 50 attracted the attention of electricity network operators and electricity generators because of its 51 importance in the management of the electric grid, market operations, and reducing the cost of 52 solar energy. With the increased penetration of distributed PV, electric utility companies are 53 heavily investing in distribution energy management systems (DMS) for data acquisition and 54 optimal operation of distribution systems and distributed resources (Melton et al., 2018). 55 Distribution PV forecasting provides essential information for DMS systems for economic 56 scheduling, reliability management, and optimal control. Among the state-of-the-art solar 57 forecasting methods in a variety of forecast time horizons, intra-hour forecasting of solar radiation 58 with high-frequency input and output data is crucial for real-time electric power system energy 59 management, especially at the distribution level. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models 60 using global observations and comprehensive physical and chemical principles are often 61 challenged by the limitations of real-time computing and availability of data in the short-term 62 horizons (Haupt et al., 2018; Kleissl, 2013). 63 Today, a very large portion of the short-term solar forecasting models uses only 64 measurements of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) to predict solar radiation in future time steps 65 (Kleissl, 2013; Yang et al., 2018). Some of them are based on time series analysis—e.g., 66 autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing (ETS), and 67 autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH)—which has been actively utilized for 68 decades by the solar energy research community and industry (David et al., 2016; Dong et al., 69 2013; Inman et al., 2013; Kleissl, 2013; Lave et al., 2013; Reikard, 2009; Sharma et al., 2016; 70 Yang et al., 2012). Other such models use machine learning techniques that analyze historical 71 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript. The published version of the article is available from the relevant publisher. 5 measurements of GHI, progressively learn the pattern of the data, and make optimized predictions 72 based on the available data (Inman et al., 2013; Voyant et al., 2017). Compared to the NWP 73 models, this classification of short-term solar forecasting models is very time efficient and more 74 feasible to users in the solar energy industry because it requires limited observations and 75 prerequisite knowledge of meteorology; however, it often neglects physical principles behind GHI 76 that have been well investigated in the study of atmospheric sciences. For example, extraterrestrial 77 solar radiation and solar zenith angle dominate solar irradiance on the Earth’s surface and can be 78 precisely simulated and predicted based on the studies of heliocentric orbits (Reda and Andreas, 79 2004). Many solar forecasting models cannot discriminate factors affecting GHI from those can 80 be computed by atmospheric models; the latter are often “learned” with GHI by statistical models. 81 As a result, the accuracy of the solar forecasting models often varies with locations and forecast 82 time horizons and therefore it is difficult to consistently beat the persistence or smart persistence 83 models (Pedro and Coimbra, 2012). 84 Xie and Liu (2013) developed a model to simultaneously retrieve cloud albedo and cloud 85 fraction from surface-based observations of solar radiation. The model and its algorithm to 86 simulate downwelling solar radiation have been used to investigate long-term cloud variations, 87 cloudy-sky radiation, and satellite observations (An and Wang, 2015; Sengupta et al., 2018; Xie 88 et al., 2014; Xie and Sengupta, 2018; Xie et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2016). In this study, we employ 89 this cloud retrieval technique to develop a Physics-based Smart Persistence model for Intra-hour 90 forecasting of solar radiation (PSPI) that decomposes short-term GHI forecast into the computation 91 of extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar zenith angle and the forecasting of cloud albedo and 92 cloud fraction. Although the forecasting of cloud albedo and cloud fraction are conducted with an 93 assumption of persistent cloud structures, they have potential to be improved with more 94 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript. The published version of the article is available from the relevant publisher. 6 comprehensive time series analysis or machine learning techniques. Compared to the persistence 95 and smart persistence models, the PSPI does not require additional observations of various 96 atmospheric parameters, but it is customizable in that additional observations if available can be 97 ingested to further improve the forecast. 98 The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the analytical formulation of the PSPI is 99 described in Section 2; the results and performance of the PSPI against the persistence and smart 100 persistence models are given in Section 3; the conclusions are given in Section 4; and the potential 101 benefits of the PSPI, and future work for further improving the accuracy of the short-term solar 102 forecasting are discussed in Section 5. 103 104 2. Methodology 105 Figure 1 illustrates the procedure of the PSPI. Following the cloud retrieval algorithm 106 introduced by Xie and Liu (2013), surface-based observations of GHI are decomposed into cloud 107 albedo and cloud fraction using simulated extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar zenith angle for 108 the current time step. When solar zenith angle varies with time, we predict future cloud fraction 109 and cloud albedo by assuming that clouds advect horizontally over the forecasting area where their 110 size, shape, and thickness are persistent within the forecasting time window. The GHI for the future 111 time step is then computed using the predicted solar zenith angle, cloud albedo, and cloud fraction. 112 The algorithms to decompose GHI, simulate extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar zenith angle, 113 and forecast cloud albedo and cloud fraction are introduced below. 114 115 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript.

Decomposition of GHI into cloud albedo and cloud fraction. 121 Following the study of Xie and Liu (2013), GHI can be simulated by 122 𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝐹𝐹1(1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓𝑇𝑇2)−1, (1𝑎𝑎) 123 where 𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 represents the total downwelling solar irradiance on the land surface, i.e. GHI, for all-124 sky conditions; 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 is the surface albedo; 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 is the cloud albedo; 𝑓𝑓 is the cloud fraction; T is the 125 transmittance of diffuse radiation of the atmosphere; and 𝐹𝐹1 is the first-order downwelling 126 irradiance at the land surface. According to the definition by Kassianov et al. (2005), the cloud 127 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript. The published version of the article is available from the relevant publisher. 8 fraction in this study is assumed as the fraction of the total projected area that is occupied by 128 clouds. 𝐹𝐹1 is given by 129 𝐹𝐹1= 𝑓𝑓𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + (1 − 𝑓𝑓)𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑, (1𝑏𝑏) 130 where 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 is the downwelling irradiance for overcast conditions when the surface albedo is 0, and 131 can be approximated by 132 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = (1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐)𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑. (1𝑐𝑐) 133 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 is the clear-sky GHI that can be simulated by the extraterrestrial solar radiation, solar zenith 134 angle, and a radiative transfer model. In this study, it is computed by a radiative transfer model 135 developed by Ineichen and Perez ((2002); hereafter referred to as the Ineichen-Perez model) due 136 to its advanced performance among other clear-sky models while requiring only minimal input 137 data (Gueymard, 2012; Reno et al., 2012). T is approximated by the transmittance of diffuse 138 radiation for the atmosphere that can be given by (Xie et al., 2016) 139 𝑇𝑇 = 2 � 𝜇𝜇𝑇𝑇𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝜇𝜇)𝑑𝑑𝜇𝜇 1 0 , (1𝑑𝑑) 140 where 𝑇𝑇𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐 is the transmittance of direct radiation that can be computed by a radiative transfer 141 model developed by Bird and Hulstrom (1981); and 𝜇𝜇 represents the cosine value of zenith angle. 142 From Eq.(1), it is seen that the forecasting of GHI can be analytically decomposed into the 143 forecasting of cloud albedo and cloud fraction when extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar zenith 144 angle for the future time step are simulated. To test the accuracy of Eq.(1), we retrieved cloud 145 albedo and cloud fraction using the algorithm of Xie and Liu (2013), a climatology value of surface 146 albedo, and 1-minute resolution GHIs measured by a Kipp & Zonen CM Pyranometer 22 (CMP22) 147 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) Solar Radiation Research Laboratory 148 (SRRL). The direct solar radiation required by Xie and Liu (2013) is computed using the GHI 149 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript. The published version of the article is available from the relevant publisher. 9 measurements and a decomposition model developed by Erbs et al. (1982). The retrieved cloud 150 albedo and cloud fraction are then input to Eq.(1) to reconstruct the GHI for the same time step. 151 Figure 2 compares the GHI measurements with the reconstruction using the retrieval of cloud 152 albedo and cloud fraction on July 17, 2013, and December 2, 2013. It shows that the reconstruction 153 has an excellent agreement with the GHI measurements for both clear-sky and cloudy-sky 154 conditions. Therefore, the accuracy of the GHI forecast by the PSPI depends only on the simulation 155 of extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar zenith angle, and the forecasting of cloud albedo and 156 cloud fraction. 157 158 159 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript.

Simulation of extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar zenith angle 164 In this study, the extraterrestrial solar radiation is provided by the Solar Position Algorithm 165 (SPA) developed by Reda and Andreas (2004) where the computation of solar position from 2000 166 BC to AD 6000 is adopted from a procedure reported by Meeus (1998). The simulation of solar 167 zenith angle for the given time and locations on the Earth is based on a method reported by Iqbal 168 (1983) that is also adopted by the SPA. According to the evaluation by surface-based observations, 169 the uncertainty of the simulated solar zenith angle is less than 0.00003° (Reda and Andreas, 2004). 170 More details about the SPA are not reinstated here because they have been extensively discussed 171 by Reda and Andreas (2004). 172 173 2.3 Forecasting of cloud albedo and cloud fraction 174 Following the study of Xie and Liu (2013) and a two-stream approximation suggested by 175 Sagan and Pollack (1967), cloud optical thickness can be computed by 176 𝜏𝜏 = 2𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐𝜇𝜇0 (1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐)(1 − 𝑔𝑔) , (2) 177 where g is the asymmetry factor of the cloud assumed to be 0.86; 𝜇𝜇0 is the cosine value of the solar 178 zenith angle; and 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 is derived by Xie and Liu (2013) using surface-based observations of solar 179 radiation. Note that the value of the asymmetry factor of the cloud is selected using an average of 180 those for different types of water-phase clouds in the solar wavelength region. The determination 181 of the asymmetry factor is not given here because it has been extensively introduced by the 182 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript. The published version of the article is available from the relevant publisher. 11 supplementary material of Xie and Liu (2013). Because we assume a persistent cloud structure 183 in a short period of time, i.e. the cloud optical thickness is persistent, cloud albedo in the future 184 time step can be computed following Xie and Liu (2013): 185 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 ′ = 𝑏𝑏𝜏𝜏 𝜇𝜇0 ′⁄ 1 + 𝑏𝑏𝜏𝜏 𝜇𝜇0 ′⁄ (3𝑎𝑎) 186 𝑏𝑏 = 0.5 − 0.5𝑔𝑔, (3𝑏𝑏) 187 where 𝜇𝜇0 ′ represents the cosine value of the future solar zenith angle. 188 By using a persistent cloud structure within the forecasting time window, we assume cloud 189 fraction follows the short-term trend when clouds moving in or out the forecasting area. In this 190 study, cloud fraction is predicted using the retrievals from the GHI observations and a 5-minute 191 exponential weighted moving average given by 192 𝑓𝑓′ = ∑ (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖=0 𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡−𝑖𝑖 ∑ (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖=0 , (4) 193 where 𝑓𝑓′ is the predicted cloud fraction; i represents the time steps in the past 5 minutes; t denotes 194 the total past time steps used in the moving average; 𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡−𝑖𝑖 is the retrieved cloud fraction; and 𝛼𝛼 is a 195 constant smoothing factor. In this study, 𝛼𝛼 is determined as 1/3 using the span (5 minute) of the 196 exponential weighted moving average. It is seen from Eq.(4) that the 5-minute exponential 197 weighted moving average employs the short-term variation trend of the cloud fraction to future 198 time steps. It should be noted that the major objective of this study is to introduce a decomposition 199 algorithm to improve the short-term forecasting of GHI, even by using a persistent or a plain 200 forecasting technique of cloud fraction. The 5-minute exponential weighted moving average is 201 selected here because it is one of the most commonly used methods to analyze time series data. 202 However, the accuracy of the PSPI should be further improved using advanced forecasting of cloud 203 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript. The published version of the article is available from the relevant publisher. 12 fraction based on time-series analysis or machine learning techniques, which deserves future 204 studies. 205 Then the predicted GHI can be given following the GHI simulation in Section 2.1: 206 𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑′ = 𝐹𝐹1 ′(1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 ′ 𝑓𝑓′𝑇𝑇2)−1 (5𝑎𝑎) 207 𝐹𝐹1 ′ = 𝑓𝑓′𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑′ + (1 − 𝑓𝑓′)𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑′ (5𝑏𝑏) 208 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑′ = (1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 ′ )𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑′, (5𝑐𝑐) 209 where 𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑′ is the predicted GHI; and 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑′ is the predicted clear-sky downwelling irradiance that 210 can be computed by the Ineichen-Perez model with the solar zenith angle for the future time step. 211 212 2.4 Comparison between the PSPI, persistence, and smart persistence models 213 The persistence model directly projects GHI measurements to future time steps. The smart 214 persistence model improves the performance of the persistence model by applying the clear-sky 215 index, the ratio of GHI measurement to the GHI modeled for a clear-sky condition, to future time 216 steps. Because of the complexity in capturing cloud properties in the atmosphere (Kleissl, 2013), 217 the persistence and smart persistence models are still among the models with top performance in 218 short-term forecasts and therefore often serve as the baseline to evaluate other forecasting models. 219 It is worth comparing their technical characteristics with the PSPI because the latter also assumes 220 a persistent cloud structure in the forecasting window. 221 Although the concept of the smart persistence model is straightforward, it decomposes the 222 forecasting of GHI into the computation of clear-sky GHI and the projection of the clear-sky index. 223 Thus, it has inherent advantages compared to other short-term solar forecasting models that are 224 unable to discriminate the forecasting of the factors affecting GHI from those can be precisely 225 computed by atmospheric models. 226 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript. The published version of the article is available from the relevant publisher. 13 However, obvious uncertainties exist in the smart persistence model: (1) the clear-sky 227 index does not respond to the variation of solar zenith angle when cloud conditions are persistent 228 within the forecasting time window; and (2) cloud coverage is inherently persistent in the smart 229 persistence model though the distribution of the clouds is constrained by cloud advection. The first 230 uncertainty has been improved by the PSPI using the forecasting of cloud albedo from future solar 231 zenith angle and a two-stream approximation as introduced by Eq.(3). Although the PSPI also 232 assumes persistent cloud structures, it considers horizontal cloud advection through the forecasting 233 of cloud fraction. Thus, the PSPI is capable of better capturing cloud conditions than the smart 234 persistence model though they require the same input data. In addition, the PSPI can efficiently 235 employ additional atmospheric observations when available to further improve the performance 236 of the cloud forecast and the Ineichen-Perez model, and thus has the potential to provide a more 237 robust GHI forecast in future. 238 239 3. Performance evaluation 240 The performance of the PSPI is evaluated using the smart persistence model and 1-minute 241 resolution GHI measurements at NREL’s SRRL from the years 2006-2016 (Fig. 3). The better 242 performing models in the 5-, 15-, and 30-minute horizons are selected from the PSPI and smart 243 persistence models for each scene. A small bin is determined in Fig. 3 for each 0.01 clear-sky 244 index and 0.01 cloud fraction where the absolute percentage error (APE) is used to understand the 245 model performance in different cloud conditions. In each time step, a count is added to the model 246 with a smaller APE. The red or blue color in each bin represents which model (PSPI or the smart 247 persistence model) performs better (with more counts in the bin). The number of pixels related to 248 each model is annotated in Fig. 3. As demonstrated by Fig. 3 using the long-term GHI 249 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript. The published version of the article is available from the relevant publisher. 14 measurements, the PSPI has a better performance than the smart persistence model in all forecast 250 time horizons between 15 and 30 minutes. For cloudy-sky conditions, the performance of the PSPI 251 increases with forecasting horizon because the clear-sky index tends to be persistent in a short 252 period of time. In the 15- and 30-minute forecasting horizons (the middle and right panels of Fig. 253 3), the PSPI performs better than the smart persistence model for most of the scenes. 254 However, some exception is noticeable in Fig.3. In a relatively clear atmosphere (e.g. the 255 clear-sky index >0.9), the smart persistent model generally beats the PSPI. This is probably caused 256 by the uncertainty of the two-stream approximation employed by the PSPI where a plane-parallel 257 cloud layer is assumed. The solution of the 1-dimensional radiative transfer equation produces 258 more bias for scattered clouds because of the cloud side illumination and shadowing by 3-259 dimensional clouds (Davies, 1984; Iwabuchi and Hayasaka, 2002). In addition, a clear sky is 260 associated with steady atmospheric conditions where the forecast of cloud properties by the PSPI 261 does not benefit the GHI forecast. Similarly, when clouds overcast the forecasting area with a low 262 transmittance of solar radiation (e.g. cloud fraction >0.8), the smart persistence model has a better 263 accuracy than the PSPI because an elimination process from cloud overcast conditions often takes 264 hours while the cloud condition is relatively steady in a 30-minute window. The PSPI performs 265 almost exclusively better than the smart persistence model in all the other cloudy-sky conditions. 266 Figure 3 also suggests that a hybrid model according to cloud properties can significantly increase 267 the accuracy of both the smart persistence model and the PSPI, which deserves further 268 investigation. 269 270 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript.

The red or blue color in each bin represents the PSPI or smart persistence model has more 274 counts with better performance, respectively. 275 276 277 The overall performance of the PSPI can be quantitatively analyzed using the Pearson 278 correlation coefficient (r), root-mean square deviation (RMSD) (Lorenz et al., 2016), and forecast 279 score (FS) that are defined by 280 𝑟𝑟 = ∑ (𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 − 𝑚𝑚� )(𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 − 𝑜𝑜̅) 𝑁𝑁 𝑖𝑖=1 �∑ (𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 − 𝑚𝑚� )2𝑁𝑁 𝑖𝑖=1 �∑ (𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 − 𝑜𝑜̅)2𝑁𝑁 𝑖𝑖=1 (6) 281 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 = �∑ (𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 − 𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖)2𝑁𝑁 𝑖𝑖=1 𝑁𝑁 (7) 282 𝐹𝐹𝑅𝑅 = 1 − 𝑛𝑛𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎 𝑛𝑛𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 , (8𝑎𝑎) 283 where N is the number of the daytime data samples from the years 2006-2016; m and o represent 284 model simulation and observation, respectively; 𝑚𝑚� and 𝑜𝑜̅ are the averaged values of m and o, 285 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript.

(8𝑏𝑏) 288 Figure 4 illustrates the Pearson correlation coefficient, RMSD, and FS of the GHI forecasts 289 using the persistence, smart persistence, and PSPI models. To understand the effect of the cloud 290 fraction forecasting on the PSPI, we also investigate the PSPI model with a persistent cloud 291 fraction (PCF). It is clear that the smart persistence model has a better performance than the 292 persistence model, whereas the PSPI with a persistent cloud fraction slightly but consistently beats 293 both of them in all forecasting horizons as evaluated by the long-term data. It can be also seen that 294 the cloud fraction forecast using a 5-minute exponential weighted moving average further 295 improves the performance of the PSPI. The improvement from the smart persistence model to the 296 PSPI is larger than or similar to that from the persistence model to the smart persistence model, 297 which is more obvious in the 5-minute ahead forecast. 298 This can be also confirmed by Table 1, which lists the Pearson correlation coefficient, 299 RMSD, and FS of the GHI forecasts in 5-, 15- , 30-, and 60-minute horizons. Table 1 also provides 300 mean bias error (MBE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the GHI forecasts, defined as 301 𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 = 1 𝑁𝑁 � (𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 − 𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 ) 𝑁𝑁 𝑖𝑖=1 (9) 302 𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 = 1 𝑁𝑁 � |𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 − 𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖| 𝑁𝑁 𝑖𝑖=1 . (10) 303 The MBEs of the GHI forecasts for all the models are close to 0 because they assume 304 persistent GHIs, clear-sky indexes, or cloud structures within the forecasting window. Compared 305 to MAE, the accuracy improvement by using the PSPI is more evident in RMSD and FS, which 306 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript. The published version of the article is available from the relevant publisher. 17 indicates that the PSPI can help reduce large errors in the short-term forecasting of GHI. Similar 307 conclusions can be drawn from Table 2 where 5-minute averaged GHIs are used as the input. 308 Although results from the PSPI are unavailable due to the use of the 5-minute exponential weighted 309 moving average, the PSPI with PCF is more accurate than the persistence and smart persistence 310 models. Therefore, the performance of the PSPI is pretty consistent in different levels of data 311 aggregation. 312 313 314 315 Fig. 4 Pearson correlation coefficient, RMSD, and FS of the GHI forecasts from the persistence, 316 smart persistence, PSPI (PCF), and PSPI models in 5- (left), 15- (middle), and 30-minute (right) 317 horizons.

Conclusions 331 This paper reports our efforts to improve the performance of the short-term solar 332 forecasting models that are based solely on GHI measurements. Following a cloud retrieval 333 technique developed by Xie and Liu (2013), we decomposed the forecasting of GHI into the 334 forecasting of cloud properties and the computation of extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar 335 zenith angle that can be accurately provided by the SPA. Thus, advanced techniques on the 336 forecasting of cloud properties can be efficiently employed to improve the short-term GHI 337 forecast. Compared to the smart persistence model, this new algorithm accounts for the variation 338 of atmospheric transmittance by predicting cloud albedo as a function of solar zenith angle. Cloud 339 advection is considered by predicting cloud fraction using a 5-minute exponential weighted 340 moving average where a persistent cloud structure is assumed. Our results show that the PSPI has 341 a better performance than the persistence and smart persistence models in all forecasting horizons 342 between 5 and 60 minutes. This is more evident in cloudy-sky conditions. 343 344 5. Future work 345 Several points are noteworthy. The PSPI uses a cloud retrieval technique to estimate cloud 346 albedo and cloud fraction while the Ineichen-Perez model computes clear-sky irradiance on the 347 land surface. The simplicity of the equations in those models ensures that the PSPI is capable of 348 providing prompt and high-frequency forecasts of GHI. Because of the computational efficiency 349 and improved accuracy, the PSPI will become a component of a grid integration software platform 350 that provides fast (<1 minute) and reliable forecasts for grid operators and stakeholders (Melton et 351 al., 2018). As the initial stage of the model, the PSPI uses a 5-minute exponential weighted moving 352 Pursuant to the DOE Public Access Plan, this document represents the authors' peer-reviewed, accepted manuscript. The published version of the article is available from the relevant publisher. 20 average to conduct the forecasting of cloud fraction. Advanced techniques on time series analysis 353 or machine learning are expected in future studies to further improve the performance of the PSPI. 354 A hybrid approach using the smart persistence model and the PSPI should significantly improve 355 the performance of both the models. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the decomposition 356 algorithm used by the PSPI can improve the performance of the smart persistence model while 357 persistent cloud structures are assumed. The decomposition algorithm should also be capable of 358 improving the short-term solar forecasting models using additional measurements of clouds, e.g. 359 satellite-based observations (Marquez et al., 2013) and data from surface-based total sky imagers 360 (TSIs) (Chow et al., 2015; Chow et al., 2011; Marquez and Coimbra, 2013). More comprehensive 361 studies are on the way. Finally, the PSPI requires only GHI for input data, which eases the burden 362 on stakeholders and decision makers with limited access to a suite of instrumentation. Typical or 363 climatology values of the atmospheric and land surface properties, e.g., land surface albedo, are 364 used in the Ineichen-Perez model. Additional measurements from satellite- or surface-based 365 instruments should further improve the accuracy of the PSPI. 366 367 Acknowledgements 368 This work was authored by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, the Manager and 369 Operator of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 370 under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.
