INTRODUCTION Since 1975 the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Flat-Plate Solar Array Project has managed a comprehensive research and developnent acti- vity addressed to lowering, the cost and improving the utility and reliability of flat-plate photovoltaic modules and arrays for the broad spectrum of future large-scale terrestrial applications. An important part of this activity has focused on the engineer- ing sciences associated with the disciplines of structural design, series/parallel circuit design, thermal design, electrical isolation and safety, and environmental protection. This paper addresses the need to sumnarize the results from these various studies by first describing the key design requirements that have been found to govern array per- formance at the subsystem level. The data presented sumnarize the findings in the areas of system integration, safety, reliability, This paper presents the results of one phase of research conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, for the U.S. Department of Energy through an agree- ment with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ** Engineering Sciences Manager, Flat-Plate Solar Array Project, and Supervisor, Photovoltaic Engineering Group, Energy Technology Engineering Section. and environmental endurance. Application- specific and site-specific requirements are broken out where a,ppropri ate, and techniques for deriving application specific requirements are noted. Next, array support structure and module design requirements and approaches are re- viewed. Integrated into the discussion are numerous references to avai 1 able analytical tools and test methods that have been found useful in designing array elements. Emphasis is placed on identifying techniques that work and where a lack of techniques exists. An important objective of the paper is to serve as a road map to the numerous techniques identified and/or developed by the National Photovoltaics Program. 2. ARRAY SUBSYSTEH DESIGN The term \"array subsystem\" is used to refer to the entire photovoltaic array that provides dc power to the power conditioner or load, and is made up of solar-cell modules, support structures, in-f ield wiring, safety features, and aesthetic features. Before module and component requirements are examined, it is useful to address the requirements at the subsystem level, where system, application and user needs are most easily defined and judged. The job of meeting the subsystem requirements is then divided optimally among the subassemblies and components. At the subsystem level the overall require- ments can be organized into six categories: ,1) Energy performance requirements 2) Array-load interface requirements 3) Reliability requirements 4) Safety requirements 5) Aesthetics requirements 6) Costs 2.1 Energy Performancfiequirement s The primary functional requirement of an array is to generate a specific level of electrical energy oper time. This places requirements on the total rated power of the Proceedings of the 1982 Annual Meeting of the American Section of the International Solar Energy Society Houston, Texas, June 1-5, 1982, pp. 909-914. array and on the preferred tracking or fixed tilt angle. A1 though the tilt angle of a fixed-tilt array has only a small effect on total annual energy output, it can be effi- cient ly used to select the time-of-year and time-of-day distribution of energy. In general, a steep tilt angle of about 600 gives the most uniform distribution during the year, with lower tilt angles providing an increasing fraction of the energy in the sumner. East-west tilting provides a time- of-day bias. References provide excel lent detail on the distribution of energy for a variety of fixed-tilt and tracking arrays for a number of locations in the United States (1,2). 2.2 Array-1 oad lnterf ace Requirements To control I~R power losses in the power conversion equi pnent, or to otherwise satisfy the load, the array is generally required to provide maximum powr at a specified voltage level. Small system (up to a few hundred watts) generally require 12 to 24 volts; residential and load-center systems from 5 to 100 kW generally require 100 to 300 volts; and large megawatt-level installations require a maximum of 1000 to 1500 volts. Because each solar cell gener- ates roughly 0.4 volts, the array voltage requirement determines the number of cells to be connected in series, and the current requirement determines the number in parallel. An important consideration in the design of the array-1 oad interface is the fact that the array current is proportional to the instantaneous irradiance level, and the array voltage decreases about 0.5% per 1% of increasing sol ar-cel 1 temperature. The array 1 oad mu st theref ore accomnodate sub- stantial current and voltage variations caused by changing ambient conditions while continuously maximi zing the powr received from the array. Gonzalez et a1 provide a detai 1 ed treatment of array-1 oad interface design considerations including the pros and cons of various load-control strategies and estimates of maximum expected array voltage and current levels (3, 4). The results are presented parametrically in a manner useful for any array size, voltage level or geo- graphic 1 ocation. 2.3 Subsystem Reliability Requirements A third important subsystem requirement is that of achieving a cost-effective level of reli abi 1 ity and durabi 1 ity over the design- life of the system. Because of their modular nature, photovol taic arrays have a hi gher-than-normal sensitivity to comnon- mode failures, but at the same time offer a wealth of redundancy options to increase reliabi 1 ity. An important consideration in this respect is the high sensitivity to POWER LOSS = 1 - [I - (YEARS x RI]' ARRAY VOLTAGE Fig. 1. Array Degradation versus Number of Series Cells for a Cell Failure Rate (R) of 0.01% per Year individual open-circuit cell failures that results when large numbers of cells are interconnected in series. Fig. 1 illustrates the sensitivity of systems not incorporating circuit redundancy to a cell failure rate of only 0.01% per year. SERIES To ensure meeting system or application re- POWER LOSS quirements, it is necessary first to address reliability at the subsystem level. require- ments at this level are most usefully stated in terms of desired life-cycle energy cost, so that appropriate tradeoffs can be made among initial costs, long-term maintenance and rep1 acernent costs, and long-term energy loss due to accepted performance degradation over time. Means of performing these trade- offs have been developed and demonstrated (5,6,7). The results of such an analysis define the preferred maintenance and replace- ment strategy, the overall circuit and mechanical redundancy, and reliability allo- cations (failure rate and cost) for the major array assemblies and components. Example a1 locations for modules are provided in (8). CELLS , AT 5 YEARS 2.4 Subsystem Safety Requireme_n_Q An additional consideration for arrays with voltages higher than 30 volts is the re- quirement for protection from electrical shock hazards. Photovoltaic arrays are unique in that they cannot be switched off easily during hours of sunlight for installation or maintenance. In addition, the natural current-1 imit ing character of solar cells makes the use of conventional circuit fault interrupters such as circuit breakers and fuses unworkable. The burden of providing electrical safety falls on all levels of the array, from the insulation within the module to the sub- system itself. The general philosophy of providing safety is based on minimizing the chance of a ground fault (short to ground) or exposed conductor at the component or assembly level, and then providing an independent backup system to ensure safety in the event of a breakdow of the primary system. Key subsystem backup safety features include: (1) Frame grounding--to prevent the array frame from reaching an unsafe high voltage in the event of a ground fault. (2) Circuit Grounding--to prevent the solar cell circuit from floating to a high voltage above ground and thus overstressi ng the primary insulation system. Typically the negative bus or center voltage point of the array is either grounded or tied to ground through a high resistance. (3) Ground fault breaker--to sense a ground fault and stop the fault by either shorting the array or opening the array-circuit-to-ground connection. This is particularly important because a low-impedance short to ground is likely to generate a dc arc that can create a substanti a1 fire hazard. An additional safety concern is the generation of in-circuit arcs when a break occurs in an array circuit. Several such arcs have been discovered in present-day 200-to-300-vol t applications and have resulted in severe burning and charring of the photovoltaic module. The conditions for such an arc are an open-circuit break in a high-vol tage array circuit where the differ- ence between the open-circuit voltage and the operating voltage leads to a voltage across the break that is sufficient (greater than about 70 volts) to maintain the arc (Fig. 2). Once started, such arcs have been known to bum for periods of hours. The only known solution to the problem of in-circuit arcs in high-vol tage arrays is the incorporation of redundant circuitry to prevent a canplete open-circuiting of the source circuit. 2.5 Aesthetics Requirements Although aesthetics are highly subjective, they can be an important consideration when dealing with arrays in residential or highly visible comnerci a1 settings. Support struc- tures, field wiring, and modules all play interactive roles that should be addressed at the subsystem level first, and then allocated to the assembly level. Important ingredients include mdule size and aspect ratio, frame color and detailing, module surface gloss or texture, array tilt angle, and integration with an existing roof or other structure if one exists. 2.6 Subsystem Lest-Requirements In addition to providing power, being safe and looking acceptable, the complete array must also be competitively priced and inexpensive to maintain. It is important to consider price at the array level when considering cost-reduction a1 ternatives because cost reduction in some assembly or component areas often leads to increases in other areas. This author has found 100 v ARC VOLTAGE Fig. 2. Voltage Conditions that Provide the Potential for In-Circuit Arcing life-cycle costing at the array level to be an indispensible tool for guiding array de- sign optimization, particularly when per- formance degradation over time or distribu- ted maintenance costs are involved (5,6). Key cost tradeoffs that have been found to be important at the subsystem level include: (1) Designing the initial hardware to reduce site or application-specific engineering or rework, and to reduce field assembly and install at ion costs. (2) Maintaining high solar-cell and module electrical efficiency to control costs of area-related items such as support structures and module materials. Fig. 3 illustrates the important subsystem cost tradeoff between module price and module efficiency to achieve the same' array cost. ) Building in adequate reliability and life to control maintenance and re- placement costs. ) Marketing complete modular or adaptable systems to reduce application engineering, procurement, system integration and installation costs. ARRAY SUPPORT STRUCTURE DESIGN The primary purpose of the array support structure is to support the photovoltaic modules at the chosen tilt angle and possibly to serve as a means of tying the 8 % 2000- 2000 Y P\" ARRAY lm PRICE 503 - 750 l$lkWp) MO 200- 100 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 MODULE EFFICIENCY 1% ) Fig. 3. Module CostlEfficiency Tradeoff for Equal Array Cost and Area Related Costs of 37$/m2 solar cells so that they can be used by a variety of users. The requirements on the module from this point of view include providing an easily manufactured modular package of cells with broad appeal, adap- table to a variety of applications, sites, environments and array designs. In reality, both sets of requirements must be met. In the following paragraphs an attempt is made to sumnarize the total integrated set of requirements on the module and to note key design analysis and test methods and design concepts that have been found useful. SHADED PORTION OF STRUCTURE IS BELOW CROWD UML 4.1 Module Structural Design Fig. 4. Low-Cost Support Structure Using Buri ed Wooden End-Trusses module frames (if used) to ground poten- ti a1 . The cost of mass-produced structures such as the concept show in Fi estima ed to lie between 25 $/n!.a:dis 4 50 $/ depending on the size of the application (9). This represents up to 40% of the total installed cost of a future array based on 70Q/watt photovoltaic modules and approximately equals the cost contri bu- tion of the solar cells themselves. Both materi a1 ( structural member and foundation) and field installation costs are major cost contributors that must be addressed care- fully. The array show in Fig. 4 achieves major cost savings by utilizing lightweight galvanized sheet-steel beams and treated- wood end trusses, which are buried to eli- minate the need for concrete foundations. References describe additi onal low-cost ground-mounted support structure concepts (10,11,12). . . Because wi nd-1 oadi ng level -is a cost driver for many support-structure designs, a major effort has also been addressed to refining estimates of maximum aerodynamic wind-1 oad- ing levels to be expected in various field conditions. Results of an extensive wind tunnel test program indicate that wind loads in the interior of an array field, or behind a fence, are reduced to as little as 20% of the loads on a single array (13). However, dynamic interaction with the array's natural vibration frequencies has been shown to increase 1 oads when frequencies fall below about 7 Hz (13). 4. MOWLE DESIGN Addressed from the subsystem point of view, a module is a portion of the array electrical circuit that has been packaged in an easily handled unit. As such, it must embody the requirements on the overall array, and minimize the costs of shipping, installation and rep1 acement. On the other hand, from the solar-cell point of view, a module is a convenient means of packaging The primary structural requirement of the module is to support the solar cells in the field and to limit breakage of cells and other module components to an acceptable level. An important consideration is the fact that both the expected loads (wind, snow, hail, earthquakes) and the strength of the key module components (cells, glass, interconnects, encapsul ants) are probabal- istic in nature. In other words, an abso- lute value is not definable; only the pro- bability of achieving a particular *value is definable. Because of this, a variety of specialized probabilistic design methods have been generated. ANSI in its American National Standard A58.1-1972 provides standard probability data on wind, snow and earthquake loads (14) and Gonzalez provides data on hail (15). Because glass fracture is dependent on the coincidence of a flaw and a high stress, glass strength varies widely from sheet to sheet and from location to location within a sheet. Based on a combination of non-linear stress analysis and empirical fracture data, Moore provides a convenient tool for sizing glass for a given probability of failure due to uniform pressure loads such as wind and snow (16). In a second document he also des- cribes a useful cyclic loading test techni- que (17). For desi n purposes, a uniform 4 loading of 50 lb/ft is comnonly used because it provides a low probability of being exceeded and has a minimal impact on module price. Design and test techniques for hail-impact loading have also been developed in response to high levels of field failures due to hail impact (18, 19). Field experience indicates that resistance to 1-in.-dia hail is re- quired, even in low-hail-incidence regions of the country. This large size reflects the design margin required to protect the one-out-of -a- thousand weakest cell, or 1 argest gl ass f 1 aw. Minimizing life-cycle cost has been found to be the most effective means of selecting the f ai 1 ure-probabi 1 i ty levels and the associa- ted module design parameters (5,6). well characterized by the simple expression: 4.2 Module Therml-Desi gn Solar cell power output decreases at a rate of approximately 0.5% per 10C increase in temperature and makes incorporation of passive temperature control techniques economically important. For example, a lOoC increase in cell temperature has the same economic impact as a 5% increase in cost of the total installed array sub- system. In general, simple passive tem- perature control techniques have been found to be economically preferable to techniques such as active cooling or fins (20, 21). Because radiation and convection cooling are about equal in importance, maintaining high-emittance external surf aces and pro- viding for heat rejection from both the front and rear of the module are important. Air gaps or low-conductivity paths between the solar cell and either front or rear surfaces should be avoided. Fig. 5 illus- trates the typical linear effect of incident irradiance level on the cell temperature rise above ambient. The concept of a Nominal Operating Cell Temperature (NOCT) has been developed to provide a convenient means of quantifying a module's thermal design and providing a meaningful reference temperature for rating power output (19, 20, 21, 22). A module's NOCT is the temperature the cells a tain in an external environment of 80 mW/cm 3 irradiance, 20% air temperature, and 1 m/s wind velocity. This environment has been chosen so that the annual energy pro- duced by a module is well approximated by its efficiency at NOCT times the number of kWh/year of irradiance incident on tine module at the site of interest. Typical values of NOCT range from around 45% for ground-mounted arrays to -60% for roof- mounted arrays with insulated rear sur- f aces. Based on the functional dependence suggested in Fig. 5, cell temperature is PLEXIGLAS WITH AIR CAP L ALUMINUM FINNED SUBSTRATE 0 Fig. 5. SOLAR IRRADIANCE ISI, mwkmZ Cell Temperature Dependence Ambient Air Temperature and Irradiance Level NOCT- 20 ~~~~~(~c) = Tair(Oc) (-G-) To meet the requirements of safety at the subsystem level, the module itself must encorporate a variety of safety construction features. These include: Grounding a1 1 external conductive surf aces. Maintaining low leakage currents to ground so as not to interfere with ground fault sensors. Insulating all live electrical circuit elements sufficiently for the highest expected array voltage above ground. Providing high reliability and long life in all safety elements. Providing circuit redundancy (bypass diodes and/or multiple interconnects) to prevent in-circuit arcs due to open circuits. In addition to the above general require- ments, Underwriters Laboratories has developed a detailed compilation of standard safety construction practices expected to be applicable to obtaining UL listing of photo- voltaic modules in the future (23). The document also covers other safety hazards such as flamnability, sharp edges and high-temperature surf aces. An important design problem in achieving safe modules is reliably isolating the cell string from the mdule frame and external surfaces. Because of the large areas involved, this too is a flaw-sensitive design problem and requires statistical characterization of the insulation materials and processes. Mon provides useful design techniques and empirical data for the design of module electrical insulation systems (24). 4.4 Module Circuit Re_!i_ability As indicated earlier, the large number of series cells in a high-voltage (above 100-volt) array makes the array very sensitive to cell failures. Achieving high reliability requires both that piece-part failures be held to low levels and that fault-tolerant circuit redundancy be utilized. Incorporation of these solutions logically falls at the module level. Of the cell-failure mechanisms currently seen in the field, cell cracking is by far the most prevalent, and is occurring at a rate of about one cell per hundred per year. However, only 2% to 10 % of these cracked cells have been classified as failed cells due to open-circuit ing or substantial power degradation. The three primary causes of cell cracking appear to be diff erenti a1 expansion between the cell and its support, impact loading by hailstones, and reduced strength due to cell damage occurring during cell processing and module assembly. A1 though qua1 itative design techniques exist that address differ- ential expansion and hail stresses (25, 18), quantitative design for low failure rates is made difficult by the broad statistical distribution of cell strength due to process- ing-induced flaws (26). This lack of quanti- tative techniques for designing for the one-out-of -a-thousand worst-case cell pl aces a high reliance on iterative design and test techniques using thermal-cycli ng, humidity- freezing, mechanical loading and hail-impact tests, such as those defined in (19). One important means of reducing the loss associated with a cell that has cracked or otherwise degraded in a local area is the use of mu1 tiple electrical interconnects that attach to the cell at two or more locations. Statistical design techniques for assessing the level of improvement are described in (7). The use of multiple interconnects is also useful in preventing open circuits due to failure of the interconnects themselves, or their attachments to the cells. Interconnect failure due to mechanical fatigue is a classic photovoltaic array failure mode and, like cell cracking, must be treated statistically. Excel lent prediction of interconnect failure probability has been recently achieved by Mon et a1 (27) using finite-element stress analysis of the interconnect together with empirical fatigue curves that treat proba- bility of failure as a paheter (Fig. 6). His data indicate that, even with carefully control1 ed manufacture and installation, the endurance of interconnects from the same lot can be expected to vary by as much as a factor of 100. Because of the difficulty and expense of attempting to eliminate the extreme-low- endurance cells and interconnects, the preferred approach to achieving high re- 1 i abi 1 ity involves maintaining piece-part failures at low but finite levels, and then introducing redundancy features to control array degradation. Analyses conducted by this author indicate that if cell open-circuit failures are maintained at about 0.0001 per year or lower, then the effect of these failures on system power degradation can be reduced to negligible levels through the use of fault-tolerant ser ies/paralleling and bypass diodes (5). Use of these circuit 'redundancy techniques is also effective in improving module yield (4,7) and controlling hot-spot cell heating YEARS. Y Fig. 6. Fatigue Curve for Copper Cell Interconnects with Probability of Failure as a Parameter (28). Design techniques for selecting appropriate seriedparal leling and bypass diode configurations are described in detail (5,7,28). An overview of these techniques is provided in (29). 4.5 Module ~nvironmental_~ndurance In addition to failures which are best treated in terms of reliability statistics, there are a number of failures that are more appropriately considered in terms of environmental endurance. General deterio- ration or failure of the module encapsulant system is a primary example. The same temperature and humidity cycling stresses which cause many cell and interconnect failures also severely stress the encap- sulant system. Ultraviolet irradiation, corrosion, and optical-surface soiling also lead to degradation of module materials and optical performance. REhlOTE hlOUNTAlN TOP I Fig. 7. Loss in Array Short-circuit Current (Isc) Due to Soiling Versus Days of Field Exposure A substantial effort within JPL activities has been directed at developing encapsulant materials and processes and understanding potential life-limiting failure mechanisms. A detailed overview of present encapsulant system materials and design techniques is found in (30) and useful environmental qualification tests for assessing the re1 ative perf onnance of candidate systems are included in (19). Useful data on the re1 at ive soi 1 i ng of various module-surf ace materials is presented in (31) and in Fig. 7. Many design requirements, design analysis and test methods, and design approaches have been identified and developed for f lat-plate photovoltaic arrays and modules over the past few years as part of the National Photovoltaics Program. These technology developnents have defined means of reducing the cost and improving the utility and reliability of photovoltaic arrays and mo- dules for a broad spectrum of terrestrial applications. This paper has provided an overview of a large number of these engi- neering developents and provides a convenient reference to mow detai 1 ed documentation in the literature.
