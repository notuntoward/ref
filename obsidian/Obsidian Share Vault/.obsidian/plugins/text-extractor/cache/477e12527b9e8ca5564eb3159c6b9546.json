In concentrating solar power plants, the direct normal irradiance is the key variable in the system operation. However, direct normal irradiance is rarely measured as compared to global horizontal ir- radiance. There are several models that can be used to derive the direct normal irradiance from global horizontal irradiance. In this study, the Engerer model is used as a decomposition model, then evaluated against in situ observations at three ground stations: Seoul, Buan, and Jeju ground stations. The relative root mean square errors between the observed and direct normal irradiance estimated by the Engerer model are 15.0%, 19.4%, and 17.1% at Seoul, Buan, and Jeju ground stations, respectively. The uncertainty of estimates is represented by the prediction interval from probabilistic prediction through Monte-Carlo simulation that employs the bias between estimation and ground truth for training datasets. The prediction interval for 90% confidence level is 117.9 W m −2 at the Seoul station, resulting from Monte-Carlo simulation. The prediction interval coverage probability is 92.8%, implying that the probability that observed DNI is not included in the prediction interval is 7.2%. The error metrics for probabilistic prediction indicates that Monte-Carlo simulation provides both valid and more informative estimations. 1. Introduction Due to increasing interest in climate change, solar energy has come to be recognized as an alternative to fossil fuel. At the utility scale, solar energy resource assessments have to be performed through feasibility studies as a top priority. It is true that the contribution of photovoltaic systems to electric power generation has increased significantly in the past few decades. Aside from that, the number of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants has increased drastically in regions where solar energy resources are sufficient, since CSP plants are more efficient than photovoltaic systems (Perez and Perez, 2009; IEA, 2014; IRENA, 2018). For example, IRENA (2018) reported that the capacity factors of CSP plants and photovoltaic systems are 46.7% and 17.6%, respectively. A long-term database of solar irradiance is essential for the correct design of zero energy building and for the energy performance model of CSP plants as well as photovoltaic systems (Lu et al., 1998; Trujillo, 1998; Li and Lam, 2000). The reliable resource assessment of CSP plants depends on the accuracy of Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) data, because the CSP system directly utilizes DNI. When DNI observations are missing, an alternative method is required to derive them. The decomposition models of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) into DNI and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI) have been developed for 58 years since Liu and Jordan (1960) first proposed the polynomial model (e.g., Orgill and Hollands, 1977; Erbs et al., 1982; Skartveit and Olseth, 1987; Reindl et al., 1990; Chandrasekaran and Kumar, 1994; Boland et al., 2001; Karatasou et al., 2003; Posadillo and López Luque, 2009). Most of these models use the clearness index (kt) as a primary predictor, then estimate the diffuse fraction (kd) with the relationship of kt with kd. For the purposes of clarity, kt and kd are defined here as follows: k S d GHI cos ,t z s0 = × × (1) k DHI GHI GHI DNI cos GHI ,d z= = × (2) where S0, θz and ds are the solar constant, 1361 W m−2 (Gueymard, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2019.01.030 Received 1 March 2018; Received in revised form 7 January 2019; Accepted 8 January 2019 ⁎ Corresponding author.

(2013) have developed a polynomial model to convert the GHI data into DNI data for the Korean Peninsula. More recently, the Reindl-2 model (Reindl et al., 1990) was modified by Lee et al. (2017) who adjusted the coefficients of formulation in order to produce better DNI estimates for the Korean Peninsula. However, they used the in situ GHI measurements averaged into hourly means. Nowadays, observing instruments are capable of measuring solar irradiance at the minute scales, which implies that the previous decomposition models using hourly averages of GHI are restricted in deriving the DNI estimates at minute scales. Engerer (2015) proposed a decomposition model (here- after Engerer model) which divides the observed GHI at one-minute resolution into DNI and DHI components. Gueymard and Ruiz-Arias (2016) validated 140 decomposition models through observations made at 54 world-wide ground stations in order to examine the un- certainty of models, and the Engerer model was selected as the best model in ‘Temperate’ climate zones such as the Korean Peninsula. Risk analysis of CSP plants is influenced by uncertainty due to inter- annual variability and data quality (Meyer et al., 2009). Inter-annual variability is taken into account by the probabilistic modeling of solar thermal power plants developed by Ho et al. (2011) who generates the cumulative density function for energy production. The uncertainty due to data quality is directly connected to the instruments themselves, and could therefore be reduced by either calibration or data qualification procedure. The decomposition model for the derivation of DNI esti- mates yields uncertainty in the CSP feasibility study (e.g., Cebecauer and Suri, 2015; Röttinger et al., 2015). Polo et al. (2016) presented a new concept called “site-adaptation” in which the uncertainty of modeled solar radiation can be reduced by using short-term measure- ment data. Beyond that, the uncertainty of deterministic estimates is crucial information for quantifying the reliability of deterministic pre- dictions. In terms of statistics, the uncertainty could be expressed as the prediction interval that is output from probabilistic predictions (Khosravi et al., 2013; Chu et al., 2015; Chu and Coimbra, 2017). DNI estimates with a prediction interval for a nominal confidence level will be useful information for solar energy resource assessment when in situ measurements of DNI are missing, and will furthermore play a crucial role in mitigating the risks of renewable energy projects. There are several ways to produce probabilistic forecasts for renewable energy (e.g., Alessandrini et al., 2015; Chu et al., 2015; Golestaneh et al., 2016; Hong et al., 2016; Chu and Coimbra, 2017). Alessandrini et al. (2015) introduced the analog ensemble forecast, based on deterministic fore- casts from numerical weather prediction (NWP). Monte-Carlo simula- tion is widely employed to generate the probability of the target value with repeated random samples as a probability density function (Ripley, 1987). Random variables or inputs are modelled based on a probability density function, such as normal or log normal distribution. Different iterations or simulations are run for path generation, i.e., random variables vary with time and the outcome is reached by using suitable numerical computations. Recently, big data for renewable en- ergy with developing computation power enables Monte-Carlo simu- lation to produce probabilistic predictions (Conti and Raiti, 2007; Bracale et al., 2013; McQueen et al., 2004; Monforti et al., 2014). Conti and Raiti (2007) predicted the energy load flow using a deterministic model, then proposed the models that were incorporated into a radial distribution probabilistic load flow by using Monte-Carlo simulation. When compared to a single model forecast, multi-model ensemble forecasts can significantly reduce the error in model output because the models with a multi-model ensemble are adjusted for their biases. Multi-model ensemble forecasts are usually employed for climate pre- diction (e.g., Krishnamurti et al., 2000; Lambert and Boer, 2001; Gillett et al., 2002; Doblas-Reyes et al., 2003; Palmer et al., 2005). For in- stance, Gillett et al. (2002) found improvements in the performance of a multi-model ensemble average over single models for detecting and attributing greenhouse gas warming and sulfate cooling patterns in the observed climate record. In addition, Lambert and Boer (2001) showed that an equally weighted average of several coupled climate models agrees better with actual observations than any single model. In re- newable energy forecasting, multi-model ensembles are also employed in order to produce probabilistic forecasts (Ren et al., 2015; Cheung et al., 2015; Haupt and Kosović, 2017). Haupt and Kosović (2017) in- troduced a new technique that employs several NWP models using a machine learning method to blend all predictions. The Bootstrap technique has been widely employed to make prob- abilistic forecasts since Efron (1982) first described the mathematical formulation. Prediction intervals and corresponding probability are determined by bootstrap resampling. The main advantage of this ap- proach is its simplicity and ease of implementation. The major differ- ence between the Bootstrap technique and the Monte-Carlo simulation is that the latter generates the samples from a theoretical distribution with the predefined parameters, whereas the Bootstrap technique re- samples from the given data. Therefore, this study is concerned with (1) estimating DNI from GHI observations at the minute scale using the Engerer model, (2) producing the prediction intervals for DNI estimates using a Monte-Carlo simu- lation, and (3) evaluating the performance metrics of the probability forecasts from Monte-Carlo simulation, multi-model ensemble predic- tions, and the Bootstrap technique. The major findings from this work are intended to be useful for quantifying the prediction interval of DNI estimations and furthermore for evaluating the risk of over- or under- estimated DNI in CSP feasibility studies. Section 2 introduces the sur- face observations used in the present study. Section 3 briefly describes the Monte-Carlo simulation, 50 decomposition models, and the Boot- strap technique. Then, the evaluation results are discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our findings. 2. Surface observations Fig. 1 shows the location of ground observing stations operated by the Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER). Table 1 summarizes the geographical details with the data availability in each station. At all of the stations, GHI and DNI are measured by a CMP 10 pyranometer and CHP1 pyrheliometer manufactured by Kipp & Zonen, respectively. GHI observations are employed for the decomposition model as an input variable, but the observed DNI is compared with the modeling output in the evaluation process. Before deriving the DNI estimates, the data quality control has to be performed in order to eliminate outliers. The Fig. 1. Map of the study area, topography (shaded area), and locations of ground observations. The numbers indicate Seoul, Buan, Jeju, Fukuoka stations, respectively. C.K. Kim et al. Solar Energy 180 (2019) 63–74 64 present study employs the criterion employed in Gueymard and Ruiz- Arias (2016) for data quality control. The data points that did not sa- tisfy the following conditions were rejected: 1. θz > 75° 2. GHI > 0 and DHI > 0 and DNI ≥ 0 3. DNI < 1100 + 0.03 × H 4. DNI < E0n 5. DHI < 0.95 × E0n × cos1.2θz + 50 6. GHI < 1.50 × E0n × cos 1.2θz + 100 7. Abs(Closr) < 5% 8. DHI/GHI < 1.05 for GHI > 50 and θz < 75° 9. DHI/GHI < 1.10 for GHI > 50 and θz > 75°, where H is elevation (m), E0n is the extraterrestrial irradiance on a normal surface that is corrected for the Sun-Earth distance, and Closr = 100×(DNI × cosθz + DHI − GHI)/GHI is the closure error in percentage. Condition (1) is different from that used in Gueymard and Ruiz-Arias (2016). There are buildings around some stations, and therefore the threshold value of θz for solar elevation is set at 75° in order to eliminate solar irradiance measured at low sun elevation, which is usually contaminated by surface reflection and ground ob- stacles (Mathiesen and Kleissl, 2011). The investigation period is set at 17 months from January 2016 to May 2017, and then we divided all datasets into training and test datasets as 70% and 30% of the total datasets, respectively, through a random sampling method. 3. Methodology 3.1. Deterministic prediction model As introduced, the Engerer model is employed as a deterministic prediction model. This model has employed the logistic regression for deriving kd that ranges between 0 and 1 since Boland et al. (2001) in- itially developed the conceptual framework for the use of the logistic model. In the Engerer model, the predicted diffuse fraction (kdp) is formulated by five predictors; kt, Apparent Solar Time (AST), θz, Δktc, and kde. k C C k k k 1 1 exp( AST , dp t z tc de 0 1 2 3 4 5 = + + + × + × + × + × + × (3) where Δktc, sometimes called the variability index, represents the de- viation of the observed kt value from the kt at clear sky (ktc): k k k ,tc tc t= (4) k S d GHI cos ,tc z s c 0 = × × (5) where GHIc is the GHI at clear sky, which comes from the University of Arizona Solar Irradiance Based on Satellite - KIER (UASIBS-KIER) model (Kim et al., 2016a, 2017). The UASIBS-KIER model products are derived from the visible reflectance (0.53–0.71 μm) and brightness tempera- tures (3.72–4.1 μm for shortwave infrared channel; 10.2–11.2 μm for window infrared channel) observed every 15 min by the Meteorological Imager onboard Communication, Ocean, Meteorological Satellite. A look-up table showing the shortwave albedo at the top of atmosphere (TOA), generated by the Goddard Space Flight Center Radiative Transfer Model (GSFC RTM) (Chou and Suarez, 1999), is populated for discrete values of the solar zenith angle, surface albedo, ozone, water vapor, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud optical depth (COD). The monthly average ozone concentrations were obtained from the clima- tological background (Tilmes et al., 2012). The daily water vapor mixing ratio profiles were obtained from rawinsonde launched at Osan observing station at 0000 UTC every morning. The vertically integrated AOD measured at Yonsei University, Korea as a part of Aerosol Robotic Network is redistributed at each vertical level to parameterize the aerosol extinction coefficient profile in GSFC RTM by using an ex- ponential distribution (Ruiz-Arias et al., 2013). For the sake of simpli- city, UASIBS-KIER model employs the monthly averages of AOD that are same values over the Korean Peninsula. It might be an obvious source of local uncertainty in GHIc. Kim et al. (2017) showed that the relative root mean square error for deriving the GHIc is 7.4% at in- stantaneous time scale in Korea in 2015. Clouds detected by the satellite imagery are classified as being clear or overcast with 1 km resolution and then regrouped into clear, cloudy or mixed sky by using cloud fraction over a 1 × 1 km 2 target areas. The cloud top pressure (CTP) is used to classify cloud types into high-level cloud (50 ≤ CTP < 440 hPa and shortwave TOA albedo < 0.6), mid-level cloud (440 ≤ CTP < 680 hPa), low-level cloud (680 ≤ CTP < 1000 hPa), and cumulus cloud (50 ≤ CTP < 440 hPa and shortwave TOA albedo ≥ 0.6). For a given cloud type, solar zenith angle and surface albedo, a transmittance is determined by comparing the observed shortwave TOA albedo to the modeled shortwave TOA albedo. Finally, the solar irradiance including GHI and DNI is calculated by multiplying the transmittance and ex- traterrestrial solar spectrum corrected by the solar zenith angle and Sun-Earth distance. The Engerer model deals explicitly with the overirradiance, which physically results from the cloud enhancement on solar irradiance (Yordanov et al., 2013). Gueymard (2017) showed that the decom- position model underperforms when cloud enhancement exists; the relative error is 11.8% for the Engerer model. Since the general form of logistic regression is a sigmoid function, all values are bounded be- tween zero and one, i.e., the lower and upper boundaries under any condition are imposed within that functional framework. Hence, in order to create a new model that can yield the GHI value exceeding GHI at clear sky, a linear correction must be added into the sigmoid via a new variable, kde. The term of kde refers to the contribution of over- irradiance to the DHI, and is defined by k MAX 0, 1 GHI GHI .de c= (6) In Eq. (3), the coefficients of β0, β1, β2, β3, β4, β5, and C are taken from Engerer (2015). 3.2. Monte-Carlo simulation The Engerer model first estimates DNI, which produces some bias relative to the in-situ observations. The two-dimensional histogram of relative frequency as a function of the bias (kdp − kdo) and cosθz is il- lustrated in Fig. 2, which shows that the biases deviate asymmetrically from the zero bias at a specific cosθz. If the bias distribution is known exactly in prediction of the DNI estimates, we could correct them by subtracting the biases from DNI estimates. Based on the history of bias distributions, Monte-Carlo simulation here predicts the bias distribution of DNI estimates by using random numbers. Fig. 3 is the flow chart of the Monte-Carlo simulation needed to yield the probabilistic distribu- tion of DNI estimates. The flow chart is divided into two parts, i.e., Table 1 Summary of details for ground observing stations. Observing components and data availability are given in the Table.

Solar Energy 180 (2019) 63–74 65 training and test parts. In the training part, the Engerer model produces the predicted diffuse fraction (kdp) by using GHI measurements in the training datasets at the first step. Then, the biases between kdp and the observed diffuse faction (kdo) are collected as a function of cosθz. The third step involves finding the continuous probability density function that is fitted to biases distribution at each cosθz bin using the fitdistr- plus package in R software. Consequently, the training parts provide the scale and shape factors for the continuous probability density function, which represents the bias distribution. Fig. 4a is an example of training dataset. The relative frequency distribution of biases is given as a his- togram that is formulated by a Gamma distribution. The first step in the test part is to calculate kdp by using the Engerer model. The scale and shape factors for continuous probability density function of biases are found for the cosθz bin that corresponds to cosθz from the test datasets. Then, the pre-processor generates 20,000 random numbers that satisfy the continuous probability density func- tion by using the scale and shape factors. The probability density function is the predicted distribution of biases that is the best correction function for kdp at cosθz from the Engerer model. We can now correct the DNI estimates by subtracting the predicted biases. Since the biases are given as the probability density function, the deterministic DNI estimates are also converted into the probabilistic DNI estimates, re- sulting in the distribution of kdp (Fig. 4b). The final step is to derive the kdp into a distribution of DNI estimates (Fig. 4c). 3.3. Multi-model ensembles Ensemble forecasts are originally performed by a lot of ensemble members that are initialized by the perturbation of initial atmospheric states. In contrast, a multi-model ensemble prediction collects the forecasting results from several models, then produces the ensemble average or median value. Gueymard and Ruiz-Arias (2016) summarize the evaluation results from 140 different decomposition models at Fu- kuoka Baseline Surface Radiation Network station that is just 360 km away from Jeju station (see the Fig. 1). Therefore, we select the 50 models with the smallest relative errors, including the Engerer model, to predict the probability density function of DNI estimates. The de- tailed characteristics of each model are given in Appendix A with cor- responding references. From Gueymard and Ruiz-Arias (2016), the lowest relative error, 11.11%, is produced by the Skartveit1 Model for the derivation of DNI at Fukuoka station. 3.4. Bootstrap The Bootstrap technique also predicts the distribution for the esti- mates by resampling the data in the given datasets. In this study, Bootstrap resamples the biases (kdp − kdo) at a given cosθz from the training datasets. The distribution of DNI estimates is produced by subtracting the biases from the DNI estimated by the Engerer model. After the DNI distribution is determined, the prediction interval is calculated for a nominal confidence level. 4. Results and discussions The deterministic estimates are assessed using Mean Bias Error (MBE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and RMSE normalized to the observation (rRMSE) as follows: N P OMBE 1 ( ), i N i i 1 = = (7) N P ORMSE 1 ( ) , i N i i 1 2= = (8) O rRMSE RMSE , N i N i 1 1 = = (9) where P and O are prediction (estimation) and observation, respec- tively, and N is the number of samples. A prediction interval with a nominal confidence level can be derived from the probability density function itself; P(95%) − P(5%) for a 90% confidence level. It is then evaluated using the Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and the Prediction Interval Normalized Averaged Width (PINAW). PICP, which physically refers to how many observations are covered by prediction intervals at a given confidence level, is defined as Fig. 2. Two-dimensional histogram of relative frequency as the function of bias (kdp − kdo) and θz from the training datasets. Fig. 3. Flow chart of the Monte-Carlo simulations. C.K. Kim et al.

PINAW is the prediction interval normalized to the clear-sky DNI (DNIc) for implying the informativeness of the prediction interval as follows: Fig. 4.

Like the clear-sky GHI, DNIc is also determined by the output of the UASIBS-KIER model. In the previous study of Kim et al. (2016b), rRMSE value of DNIc against the instantaneous DNI observations is 8.4% from January to February 2016. In theory, PICP and PINAW are conflicting error statistics: a narrow prediction interval occasionally results in a small PICP due to some true values dropping out of prediction intervals. To account for these error statistics, a combinational index is required to quantify how wide the prediction intervals are and what the corresponding coverage prob- ability is. The following coverage width-based criterion (CWC) is a Fig. 7. Scatter plots of 1-minute DNI between ground observations and Engerer model estimates at Seoul (a), Buan (b), and Jeju (c) station.

Quantity η is another control variable which is set at 50 ac- cording to Khosravi et al. (2013). 4.1. Deterministic predictions In terms of deterministic predictions, the model's performance is evaluated by comparing the estimates with observations at the Seoul, Buan, and Jeju ground stations at the minute time scale. Fig. 5 shows an example of the time series of observed and estimated DNI by the En- gerer model for January 3, 2017. The estimated DNI values are con- sistent with the observed except for the period from 1330 to 1400 Local Standard Time (LST = UTC + 9). At 1345 LST, the DNI observation is 630.4 W m −2 and the corresponding kdo is 0.3533. The predicted DNI, however, is overestimated as being 778 W m−2, which is attributed to the underestimated kdp (=0.2013). Fig. 6 is a scatter plot of kt and kd from observations and estimations through the whole year of 2016. The kdp values from the Engerer model are bounded between 0 and 1 because this model employs logistic re- gression. The distributions of kdo at a given kt are broader than those of kdp because the diffusion process of solar irradiance due to atmospheric particles cannot be not simply parameterized by just a few predictors.

C.K. Kim et al. Solar Energy 180 (2019) 63–74 69 A direct comparison between the estimated and observed DNI for test datasets is illustrated in Fig. 7 for all observation stations. When compared with DNI observations at the Seoul station, all estimates from the Engerer model are highly correlated with the observations (γ2 = 0.94) (Fig. 7a). Behaviors similar to those of the Seoul station are seen in the other stations at Buan and Jeju Island (Fig. 7b and c). Table 2 lists the MBE, RMSE, rRMSE, and kt for all ground stations. MBE values are positive for all stations, thus indicating that the Engerer model overestimates DNI. The positive bias is due to the limitations in this empirical model, which cannot explicitly resolve the interaction between shortwave radiation and cloud drops (Noia et al., 1993; Zarzalejo et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2016). The RMSEs range from 56.0 to 68.5 W m−2, which are normalized to observed DNI as ranging from 15.0 to 19.4% (Table 2). 4.2. Probabilistic predictions We now investigate the reliability of the probabilistic forecasts of the Monte-Carlo simulations. First, median values (P50) of the prob- abilistic distribution of DNI estimates resulting from the Monte-Carlo simulations, multi-model ensemble, and Bootstrap are evaluated by the observed DNI in order to compare them with the performance metrics of the Engerer model itself. The MBE, RMSE, and rRMSE values are summarized in Table 3. The RMSE is 58.0 W m−2, which is normalized as being 14.4% at Seoul station. All rRMSEs between the observations and the median DNI estimates from Monte-Carlo simulation are slightly smaller than those from the Engerer model for all stations because the model bias of DNI estimates from the Engerer model is already cor- rected by the bias distribution from the training datasets at the test parts through the Monte-Carlo simulation (compare rRMSEs in Tables 2 and 3). In particular, the Monte-Carlo simulation reduces the biases by 2% in the rRMSE at Buan and Jeju stations, where rRMSE values are larger than Seoul station. As introduced in Section 3.3, a multi-model ensemble prediction is another way to produce the probabilistic forecasts. Based on the pre- liminary results from Gueymard and Ruiz-Arias (2016), the 50 best decomposition models of their study estimate DNI, and then the fre- quency distribution of DNI estimations is set with median values. The rRMSE between the observed DNI and median value of DNI estimates are larger than those of the Monte-Carlo simulation (Table 3). When the bootstrap technique is employed in deriving probabilistic predictions, the rRMSE values for the median DNI estimates are similar to those for the Engerer model. For each confidence level, the prediction intervals are determined directly by the frequency distribution of the ensemble members re- sulting from the Monte-Carlo simulation. An example of prediction interval is given in Fig. 5. All DNI observations are included between the 12.5% and 87.5% limits of the total ensemble: the probability that the prediction interval includes the observed DNI is 75% whereas that of the opposite is 25%. At 1345 LST, the cumulative distribution of ensemble members is likely to be highly skewed with a long tail on one side, which appears to be the Gamma distribution (Fig. 8). DNI is then observed out of the lower octile (=12.5% from the lowest), because the bias distributions are determined by the training datasets in which the Engerer-estimated DNI values are close to the observed DNI. In other words, the Engerer model assumes sunny sky or clear sky at 1345 LST and then the Monte-Carlo simulation predicts a skewed Gamma dis- tribution from the training datasets. In reality, however, the sky is more cloudy than expected and therefore the observed DNI is out of the 75% confidence level. Table 4 summarizes the prediction intervals for nominal confidence levels of 90%, 75%, and 50% from the Monte-Carlo simulation, multi- model ensemble, and Bootstrap. Prediction intervals for the 90% con- fidence level are smallest with the Monte-Carlo simulation when com- pared with compared to the multi-model ensemble or Bootstrap; 117.9 W m −2 for Monte-Carlo simulation, 261.4 W m−2 for multi- model ensemble, and 183.5 W m −2 for Bootstrap technique at Seoul station. A summary of PINAW in Table 4 shows that the largest pre- diction interval for the 90% confidence level is provided by the multi- model ensemble. The PINAW values are 16.1%, 35.5%, and 24.9% from Monte-Carlo simulation, multi-model ensemble, and Bootstrap at Seoul station, respectively, which means that the width of the prediction in- terval is equivalent to 35.5% of the clear-sky DNI with the multi-model ensemble. The behaviors of prediction intervals at the Seoul station are similar to those at the other stations. The PICP for the 90% confidence Fig. 10. The CWC values for the confidence level of 90% (black), 75% (red), and 50% (green) by Monte-Carlo simulation for each cloud type at Seoul (a), Buan (b) and Jeju (c) station. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) C.K. Kim et al. Solar Energy 180 (2019) 63–74 70 level with multi-model ensemble is 80.0% at Seoul station, which is lower than the 92.8% for Monte-Carlo simulation and 96.1% for Bootstrap. The PICP generally appears to increase with the prediction interval. However, PICP is smallest despite the fact the width of the prediction interval is largest when the multi-model ensemble is em- ployed in deriving a probabilistic forecast of DNI estimates. This may imply that 20.0% of all observations are not included in the prediction interval. For a quantitative evaluation, we use the CWC index in order to avoid misleading PICP results in the accurate evaluation. The CWC is exactly the same as PINAW when PICP is higher than the nominal confidence level in Eq. (13). Therefore, all CWC values from the Monte- Carlo simulation are the same as PINAW values because the PICP values are all higher than the nominal confidence level. In contrast, the multi- model ensemble calculations result in a larger CWC, because the cov- erage probability is lower than a given nominal confidence level. The Bootstrap technique also produces higher CWC at the Jeju station, since PICP is only 75.3% for 90% confidence level. Consequently, Monte- Carlo simulation provides valid as well as more informative estima- tions. 4.3. Cloud impacts on deterministic and probabilistic predictions It is meaningful to analyze the performance metrics for each cloud class because, on average, the performance of the model is certainly dependent on sky conditions; the performance is better under clear skies and worse under cloudy skies, as could be expected. The present study employs four classes of cloud type using the UASIBS-KIER model (Kim et al., 2016a, 2017): high-level, mid-level, low-level, and cumulus clouds. The cloud classification employed here has not been validated against the eye-based observation of ceilometer. However, Kim et al. (2017) showed that the cloud types were corresponding to the expected COD values, e.g., high COD for cumulus clouds and low COD for shallow cirrus. Fig. 9 is the relative frequency of four cloud classes and clear sky, and the corresponding performance metrics of the Engerer model at Seoul. The largest RMSE between the observed and estimated DNI is seen for high-level clouds whereas DNI estimates are most accurate when cumulus clouds exist. The higher uncertainty in a high-level cloud class is attributed to the fact that the scattering effects of ice crystals on incoming solar radiation are not simply parameterized because physical processes are complicated (Fu and Liou, 1993). In practice, the Engerer model does not distinguish the cloud type in the derivation of DNI from the observed GHI. In contrast to the case of high-level clouds, the En- gerer model produces a more precise value of kdp for cumulus clouds, because these usually have higher values of COD, which means that the kdp could be parameterized as a simple formulation. The behavior of CWC for each cloud class appears to be similar to that of RMSE, as shown in Fig. 10. The CWC value is the smallest for the cumulus clouds bin, which means that a Monte-Carlo simulation produces a valid and informative prediction interval when sky is covered with cumulus clouds over Seoul’s station. CWC can be larger than 10 4 in the high- level cloud bin. However, CWC amounts to 1.2, 1.1, and 1.0 for 90%, 75%, and 50% confidence levels, respectively, because the relative frequency of high-level cloud is 0.7%. Unlike Seoul station, low level clouds that are rarely observed produce more uncertainty at rMBE, rRMSE and CWC values. 5. Conclusions Decomposition models of GHI into DNI are widely employed for hourly mean solar irradiance because GHI observations have prevailed over the past decades. Recently, however, in situ observations are made for fine temporal resolution, such as at the second scale. The Engerer model is selected in this study as a deterministic prediction model, based on the evaluation results done by Gueymard and Ruiz-Arias (2016). Furthermore, the prediction intervals for 90%, 75%, and 50% confidence levels are developed for DNI estimations based on Monte- Carlo simulations. The rRMSE values of deterministic estimates from Engerer model were 15.0%, 19.4%, and 17.1% at Seoul, Buan, and Jeju stations, re- spectively. The median value of DNI estimates resulting from prob- abilistic predictions by a Monte-Carlo simulation is the primary output to be compared with in situ observations. The RMSE between the ob- served DNI and median value of DNI estimates is 58.0 W m−2, which is normalized as being 14.4% at the Seoul station. Compared to other techniques (multi-model ensemble and Bootstrap), the prediction interval for a 90% confidence level from a probabilistic prediction by the Monte-Carlo simulation is 117.9 W m −2, which is smaller than the 261.4 W m −2 for multi-model ensemble and 183.5 W m −2 for Bootstrap at the Seoul station. The quantitative eva- luation is carried out using the PICP, PINAW, and CWC values as the performance metrics of probabilistic prediction. PICP values appear to be smaller in the multi-model ensemble than in the Monte-Carlo si- mulation. However, the PINAW of the multi-model ensemble indicates that the width of prediction intervals for each confidence level is 35.5% of clear-sky DNI at the Seoul station. The large value of CWC indicates that PICP is lower than the nominal confidence level with larger PINAW. At the same confidence level, the CWC values are exactly the same as PINAW when the Monte-Carlo technique is employed in pro- ducing the probabilistic predictions. However, the multi-model en- semble results in the largest CWC because of larger PINAW and smaller PICP for a 90% confidence level. Consequently, the Monte-Carlo tech- nique provides valid and more informative estimations. The characteristics of error metrics are analyzed for cloud classes that are determined by the UASIBS-KIER model. The latter aims at deriving the GHI and DNI with ancillary output, such as cloud type and COD, by using satellite imagery and a radiative transfer model. Satellite derived solar irradiance with cloud microphysical characteristics might not be available for research area at high spatiotemporal resolution. Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System, i.e., CERES (Trenberth et al., 2009) could be employed in spite of coarse resolution. The rRMSE between the observed and estimated DNI by the Engerer model is the largest for high-level clouds: the scattering effects of ice crystals on the incoming solar radiation is still challenging to parameterize as a simple formulation. In contrast, cumulus clouds that have a larger COD are relative easy to be parameterized by a few predictors in decomposing the GHI into DNI. Therefore, a new decomposition model should be reconstructed as a function of cloud type in order to improve the modeling performance. In the future, the probabilistic predictions with prediction interval of DNI estimates will help evaluate evaluate the uncertainties of Typical Meteorological Year datasets, and will then contribute to estimating the prediction interval of electric power generation from the energy per- formance models, such as the System Advisor Model. In addition to resource assessment, the deterministic forecasts of solar irradiance obtained from NWP can be extended toward a probabilistic forecast with prediction interval for a given confidence level (e.g., Lorenz et al., 2009; Mathiesen et al., 2013; Alessandrini et al., 2015).
