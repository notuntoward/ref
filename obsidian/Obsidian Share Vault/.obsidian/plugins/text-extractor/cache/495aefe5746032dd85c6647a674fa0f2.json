It is essential to acknowledge that education, which plays a vital role in fostering social productivity, is also undergoing remarkable transformation by AI in both practice and scienti\u0000c discovery. In educational practice, ChatGPT can offer students affordable one-on-one tutoring that approaches the human level, thereby signi\u0000cantly enhancing the average student's performance to excellence (2). For example, Khanmigo, powered by GPT-4, empowers students with explanations, motivation, and assessment in subjects like math and computer programming (3). Consequently, AI assists teachers in reducing repetitive labor and has greater potential to improve educational practice than traditional non-AI educational technologies, such as video lectures. AI is increasingly being integrated into educational research to help researchers interpret data, conduct experi- ments, generate hypotheses, and gain insights that may not have been possible using traditional methods alone. Initially, AI offers data analysis techniques for large-scale learning analytics (4). For instance, AI has been used to annotate the emotional and cognitive features present in hundreds of thousands of interactive texts (5). Furthermore, educational simulations powered by autonomous AI agents enhance the feasibility and safety of re- search. To illustrate, intelligent agents driven by ChatGPT demonstrate human-like social learning behaviors such as observation, planning, and re\u0000ection (6). Lastly, AI has the capability to generate scienti\u0000cally veri\u0000able hy- potheses that surpass human rationality (7). For instance, AI can predict and optimize the scienti\u0000c hypothesis space of large-scale multivariate datasets (8). Of course, many challenges remain that need to be addressed, such as the ethics, accuracy, interpretability, equity, and potential long-term effects of AI in education. References and Notes 1. S.
