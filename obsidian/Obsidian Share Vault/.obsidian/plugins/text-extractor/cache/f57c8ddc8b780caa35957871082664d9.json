Mathematics, Aston University, Birmingham B4 7ET, UK Abstract Non-uniform B-spline dictionaries on a compact interval are discussed in the context of sparse signal representation. For each given partition, dictionaries of B-spline functions for the corresponding spline space are built up by dividing the partition into subpartitions and joining together the bases for the concomitant subspaces. The resulting slightly redundant dictionaries are composed of B-spline functions of broader support than those corresponding to the B-spline basis for the identical space. Such dictionaries are meant to assist in the construction of adaptive sparse signal representation through a combination of stepwise optimal greedy techniques. 1 Introduction A representation in the form of a linear superposition of elements of a vector space is said to be sparse if the number of elements in the superposition is small, in comparison to the dimension of the corresponding space. The interest for sparse representations has enormously increased the last few years, in large part due to their convenience for signal processing techniques and the results produced by the theory of Compressed Sensing with regard to the reconstruction of sparse signals from non-adaptive measurements [1–5]. Furthermore, the classical problem of expressing a signal as a linear superposition of elements taken from an orthogonal basis has been extended to consider the problem of expressing a signal as a linear superposition of elements, called atoms, taken from a redundant set, called a dictionary [6]. The corresponding signal approximation in terms of highly correlated atoms is said to be highly nonlinear and has been proved useful to signal processing applications. Moreover, a formal mathematical setting for highly nonlinear approximations is being developed. As a small sample of relevant literature let us mention [7–9]. In regard to sparse approximations there are two main problems to be looked at; one is in relation to the design of suitable algorithms for ﬁnding the sparse approximation, and other the construction of the dictionaries endowing the approximation with the property of sparsity. In this communication we consider the sparse representation matter for the large class of signals 1 which are amenable to satisfactory approximation in spline spaces [10–12]. Given a signal, we have the double goal of a)ﬁnding a spline space for approximating the signal and b)constructing those dictionaries for the space which are capable of providing a sparse representation of such a signal by a combination of stepwise optimal greedy techniques. In order to achieve both aims we ﬁrst discuss the construction of dictionaries of B-spline functions for non-uniform partitions, because the usual choice, the B-spline basis for the space, is not expected to yield sparse representations. In a previous publication [13] a prescription for constructing B-spline dictionaries on the compact interval is advised by restricting considerations to uniform partitions (cardinal spline spaces). Since our aim entails to relax this restriction, we are forced to look at the problem from a diﬀerent perspective. Here we divide the partition into subpartitions and construct the dictionary by joining together the bases for the subspaces associated to each subpartition. Consequently, the uniform case considered in [13] arises as a particular case of this general construction. The capability of the proposed nonuniform dictionaries to produce sparse rep- resentations through a combination of stepwise optimal greedy techniques is illustrated by a number of examples. The Communication is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces spline spaces and gives the necessary deﬁnitions. The property of spline spaces which provides us with the foundations for the construction of the proposed dictionaries is considered in this section (c.f. Theorem 2). For a ﬁxed partition, the actual constructions of non-uniform B-spline dictionaries is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 addresses the problem of ﬁnding the appropriate partition giving rise to the spline space suitable for approximating a given signal. In the same section a number of examples are presented, which illustrate an important feature of dictionaries for the adapted spaces. Through a stepwise optimal greedy selection of functions, they may render a very signiﬁcant gain in the sparseness of the representation of those signals which are well approximated in the corresponding space. The conclusions are drawn in Section 5. 2 Background and notations We refer to the fundamental books [14,15] for a complete treatment of splines. Here we simply introduce the adopted notation and the basic deﬁnitions which are needed for presenting our results. Deﬁnition 1. Given a ﬁnite closed interval [c, d] we deﬁne a partition of [c, d] as the ﬁnite set of points ∆ := {xi}N +1 i=0 , N ∈ N, such that c = x0 < x1 < · · · < xN < xN +1 = d. (1) We use ∆ ◦ to denote the point set {x1, . . . , xN }, which is obtained by removing the bound- ary points from ∆. We further deﬁne N subintervals Ii, i = 0, . . . , N as: I = [xi, xi+1), i = 0, . . . , N − 1 and IN = [xN , xN +1]. Deﬁnition 2. Let Πm be the space of polynomials of degree smaller or equal to m ∈ N0 = N ∪ {0}. Let m be a positive integer and deﬁne Sm(∆) = {f ∈ C m−2[c, d] : f |Ii ∈ Πm−1, i = 0, . . . , N}, (2) where f |Ii indicates the restriction of the function f on the interval Ii. 2 The standard result established by the next theorem is essential for our purpose. Theorem 1. ( [14], pp.111) Let ∆ := {xi}N +1 i=0 , N ∈ N, such that c = x0 < x1 < · · · < xN < xN +1 = d. (3) Then Sm(∆) = span{1, x, . . . , x m−1, (x − xi)m−1 + , i = 1, . . . , N}, where (x − xi)m−1 + = (x − xi)m−1 for x − xi > 0 and 0 otherwise. We are now ready to prove the theorem from which our proposal will naturally arise. Theorem 2. Suppose that ∆1 and ∆2 are two partitions of [c, d]. It holds true that Sm(∆1) + Sm(∆2) = Sm(∆1 ∪ ∆2). Proof. It stems from Theorem 1 and the basic result of linear algebra establishing that for A1 and A2 two sets such that S1 = span{A1} and S2 = span{A2}, one has S1 +S2 = span{A1∪A2}. Certainly, from Theorem 1 and for A1 := {1, x, . . . , x m−1, (x−xi)m−1 + , xi ∈ ∆1} and A2 := {1, x, . . . , x m−1, (x−xi)m−1 + , xi ∈ ∆2} we have: Sm(∆1) = span{A1}, Sm(∆2) = span{A2}. Hence Sm(∆1) + Sm(∆2) = span{A1 ∪ A2} = span{1, x, . . . , x m−1, (x − xi)m−1 + , xi ∈ ∆1 ∪ ∆2} so that, using Theorem 1 on the right hand side, the proof is concluded. Theorem 3. Let ∆j, j = 1, . . . , n be partitions of [c, d] and ∆ = ∪ n j=1∆j. We denote the B-spline basis for Sm(∆j) as {B(j) m,k : k = 1, . . . , m + #∆ ◦ j }. Accordingly, a dictionary, Dm(∆ : ∪ n j=1∆j), for Sm(∆) can be constructed as Dm(∆ : ∪ n j=1∆j) := ∪ n j=1{B(j) m,k : k = 1, . . . , m + #∆ ◦ j }, so as to satisfy span{Dm(∆ : ∪ n j=1∆j)} = Sm(∆). When n = 1, Dm(∆ : ∆1) is reduced to the B-spline basis of Sm(∆). Proof. It immediately follows from Corollary 1. Indeed, span{Dm(∆ : ∪ n j=1∆j)} = span{∪ n j=1{B(j) m,k : k = 1, . . . , m + #∆ ◦ j }} = Sm(∆1) + · · · + Sm(∆1) = Sm(∪ n j=1∆j) = Sm(∆). 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 1: Examples of bases (graphs on the left) and the corresponding dictionaries (right graphs) for a random partition ∆ consisting of 6 interior knots. The top graphs correspond to linear B-splines (m = 2). The bottom graphs involve cubic B-splines (m = 4). The top left graph depicts the B-spline basis for S2(∆) whereas the right one depicts the B-spline dictionary D2(∆ : ∆1 ∪ ∆2) arising by merging the B-spline basis for S2(∆1) and for S2(∆2) (light and dark lines, respectively). The bottom graphs have the same description as the top graphs, but correspond to S4(∆) and D4(∆ : ∆1 ∪ ∆2). 4 Application to sparse signal representation Given a signal, f say, we address now the issue of determining a partition ∆, and sub-partitions ∆j, j = 1, . . . , n, such that: a) ∪ n j=1∆j = ∆ and b) the partitions are suitable for generating a sparse representation of the signal in hand. As a ﬁrst step we propose to tailor the partition to the signal f by setting ∆ taking into account the critical points of the curvature function of the signal, i.e., T := {t : ( f ′′ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Figure 2: Chirp signal f1 = cos(2πx2) (top left). Seismic signal f2 (top right). Cosine signal f3 = cos(8πx + φ(x)) (bottom left) for the randomly generate phase φ(x) plotted in the bottom right graph. The broken lines, indistinguishable from the continue lines representing test signals, are the resulting approximations up to error’s norm toli = 0.01||fi||, i = 1, 2, 3. We deal with the chirp signal f1 on the interval [0, 8], by discretizing it into L = 2049 samples and applying Algorithm 1 to produce the partition ∆ = T (f1, 9). The resulting number of knots is 1162, which is enough to approximate the signal, by a cubic B-spline basis for the space, within the above speciﬁed precision tol1. A dictionary D4(∆ : ∪ 10 j=1∆j) for the identical space is constructed by considering 10 subpartitions, which yield N1 = 1200 functions. The signal f2 is a piece of L = 513 data. A partition of cardinality 511 is obtained as ∆ = T (f1, 8) and the dictionary of cubic splines we have used arises by considering 3 subpartitions, which yields a dictionary D4(∆ : ∪ 3 j=1∆j) of cardinality N2 = 521. The signal f3 is discretized into L = 2049 samples. The partition ∆ = T (f1, 43) produces 732 knots. Using 26 subpartitions we build a dictionary D2(∆ : ∪ 26 j=1∆j) of N3 = 782 linear B-spline functions. Denoting by αi n, n = 1, . . . , Ni the atoms of the ith-dictionary, we look now for the subsets of indices Γi, i = 1, 2, 3 of cardinality Ki, i = 1, 2, 3 providing us with a sparse representation of the signals. In other words, we are interested in the approximations f Ki i = ∑ n∈Γi ci nαi n, i = 1, 2, 3, such that ||f Ki i − fi|| ≤ toli, i = 1, 2, 3, and the values Ki, i = 1, 2, 3 are satisfactory small for the approximation to be considered sparse. Since the problem of ﬁnding the sparsest solution is intractable, for all the signals we look for a satisfactory sparse representation using the same greedy strategy, which evolves by selecting atoms through stepwise minimization of the residual error as follows. 7 Table 1: Comparison of sparsity performance achieved by selecting atoms from the non-uniform bases and dictionaries for adapted spline space (1st and 2nd rows), dft (3rd row), cardinal wavelet bases and dictionaries (4th and 5th rows). corresponding basis (about twice as larger) the non-uniform B-spline dictionaries introduced here contain a few more functions than the basis. Nevertheless, as the examples of this section indicate, the improvement in the sparseness of the approximation a dictionary may yield with respect to the B-spline basis is enormous. Still there is the issue of establishing how to decide on the number of subpartitions to be considered. For these numerical examples the number of subpartitions was ﬁxed as the one producing the best result when allowing the number of subpartitions to vary within some range. It was observed that only for signal f2 the optimum number of subpartitions produced results signiﬁcantly better that all other values. Conversely, from signals f1 and f3 some variations from the optimum number of subpartitions still produce comparable results. 5 Conclusions Non-uniform B-spline dictionaries for adapted spline spaces have been introduced. The pro- posed dictionaries are built by dividing a given partition into subpartitions and merging the basis for the concomitant subspaces. The dictionary functions are characterized by having broader support than the basis functions for the identical space. The uniform B-spline dictio- naries proposed in [13] readily arise here as a particular case. The capability of the non-uniform B-spline dictionaries to produce sparse signal represen- tation has been illustrated by recourse to numerical simulations. This feature could be used, for instance, to address from a new viewpoint the classical problem of reducing the number of knots of a given spline function without perturbing the spline by more than an accept- able tolerance [22]. Thus, we feel conﬁdent that a number of applications could beneﬁt from this construction, e.g., we believe it could also be useful in Computer-Aided Geometry Design (CAGD), for reducing control points and for ﬁnding sparse knot sets of B-spline curves [23–25].
