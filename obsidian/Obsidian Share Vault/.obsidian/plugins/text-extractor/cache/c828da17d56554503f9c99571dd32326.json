NFPA 70° NationalElectrical Code” 2020 Edition This eglitionofNFPA 7(J, National Electrical Code,was preparedby theNational Electrical Cole: Committee and acted on by NFPA at itsJune Association Technical Meeting held June 17-20,2019, inSan Antonio, TX. It was issued by the Standards Council on August 5; 2019, with an effective date of August 25, 2019, and supersedesall previous editions. This Code was issued with Tentative Interim Amendments (TIAs) that impacted provisions in 210.52(C)(2), 240.67(C), 240.87(C), 725.121(C), and Annex DJ.For more information on TIAg, see www.nfpa.org/70 and Section 5 of the RegulationsGoverningthe Development ofNFPA Standards available at www.nfpa.org/ regs. This edition ofNFEA 70was approved as anAmerican National Standardon August 25, 2019, History and Developmentof theNationalElectrical Code® TheNationalFire Protection Association has acted as sponsor of the NationalElectrical Code since 1911. The original Code document was developedin 1897as a result of the united effortsofvarious insurance, electrical, architectural, and allied interests. In accordance with the Regulations GoverningtheDevelopment ofNFPA Standards, a NationalElectrical Corde first draft report containing proposed amendmentsto the 2017 National Electrical Code was published by NFPA in July 2018. This report recorded the actions of the various code-makingpanels and the correlating committee of the National Electrical Code Committee on each public input and first revision that had been made to revise the 2017 Code. The report was published at www.nifpa.org/70. Following the close of the public comment period, the code-making panels met, acted on each comment, and created some second revisions, which were reported to the correlating committee, NFPA published the NationalElectrical Code second draft report in April 2019, which recorded the actions of the code-making panels and the correlating committee on each public comment on the National Electrical Code Committee first draft report. The NationalElectrical Code first draft report and the NationulElectrical Code second draft report were presented to the 2019 June Association Technical Meeting for adoption. NFPA has an Electrical Section that provides particular opportunity for NFPA members interested in electrical safety to become better informed and to contribute to the development of the National Electrical Code and other NFPA electrical standards. At the Electrical Section codes andstandards review session held at the 2019 NFPA Conference and Expo, section members had the opportunity to discuss and review the reportof the National Electrical Code Committee prior to the adoptionof this edition of the Code by the association at its 2019 June Technical Meeting, This 55th edition supersedes all ather previous editions, supplements, and printings dated 1897, 1899, 1901, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1907, 1909,1911, 1913, 1915, 1918, 1920, 1923, 1925, 1926, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1933, 1935, 1937, 1940, 1942, 1943, 1947, 1949, 1951, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1962, 1965, 1968, 1971, 1975, 1978, 1981, 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993,1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017.

(A) Practical Safeguarding. The purpose of this Code is the practical safeguarding of persons and property from hazards arising from theuse of electricity. This Cadeisnot intended asa. design specification or an instruction manual for untrained persons. (B) Adequacy. This Code contains provisions that are consid- ered necessary for safety. Compliance therewith and proper maintenance result in an installation that is essentially free from hazard but not necessarily efficient, convenient, or adequate for good service or future expansion of electrical use, Informational Note: Hazards often occur because of overloading of wiring systems by methods or usage not in conformity with this Corde. This occurs because initial wiring did nat provide for increasesin the use of electricity, An initial adequateinstallation and reasonable provisians for systemchanges provide for future increases in the useof electricity. 209) Beige NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE (C) Relation to Other International Standards, The require- ments: in this Code address the fundamental principles of protection for safetycontained in Section 131 of International Flectrotechnical Commission Standard 60364-1, ElectricalInstal- intionsofBuildings. Informational Nate: IEC 60364-1, Section 131, contains funda- mental principles of protection for safety that encompass protec tion against electric shock, protection against thermal effects, protection against overcurrent, protection against fault currents, and protection against overvaliage. All of these potential hazardsare addressed by the requirements in this Ceda 90.2 Scope. (A) Cevered.

This Code is intended to be suitable for mandatory application by governmental bodies that exercise legal Jurisdiction over electrical installations, including signal ing and communications systems, and for use by insurance inspectors. The authority having jurisdiction for enforcement of the Code has the responsibility for making interpretations of the rules, for deciding en the approval of equipment and mate- rials; and for grantingthe special permission contemplated ip a number of the rules. By special permission, the authority having jurisdiction may waive specific requirements in this Code or permit alternative methods where it is assured that equivalent objectives can be achieved by establishing and maintaining effective safety. This Code may require new products, constructions, or mate rials that may not yet be available at the time the Codeis adop- ted. In such event, the authority havingjurisdiction may permit the use of the products, constructions, or materials that coxiply with the most recent previous edition of this Code adopted by the jurisdiction: | 90.5 Mandatory Rules, Permissive Rules, and Explanatory (A) Mandatory Rules. Mandatory rules of this. Code are those that identify actions that are specifically required or prohibited and are characterized by the use of the terms shall or shallnat, (B) Permissive Rules. Permissive rules of this Code are these that identify actions that are allowed but not required, are normally used to describe options or alternative methods, and are characterized by the use of the terns shall be permitted or shall nat be required ARTICLE90— INTRODUCTION %.9 (C) Explanatory Material. Explanatory material, such as refer- ences to other standards, references to related sections of this Code or information related to a Code rule, is includedin this Codein the form of informational notes. Such notes are infor- mational only and are not enforceable as requirements of this Carle Brackets containing section references te another NFPA document are for informational purposes only and are provi ded as a guide to indicate the source of the extracted text. These bracketed references immediately follow the extracted text. Inforinational Note: The forinat and language used in this Cads follows guidelines established by NFPA and publishedin the NEC Style Manual, Copies of this manual gan be obtained from NFPA, (D) Informative Annexes. Nonmandatory information relative to the use of the NECis provided in informative annexes, Infor- mative annexes are not part of the enforceable requirements of the NEC, but are included for information purposes only. 90.6 Formal Interpretations. To promote uniformity of inter- pretation and application of this Code, formal interpretation procedures have been established and are foundin the NFPA Regulations Governing Committee Projects. 90.7 Examination of Equipment for Safety. For specific tens of equipment and materials referred to in this Code, examina- tions for safety made under standard conditions provide a basis for approval where the record is made generally available through promulgation by organizations properly equipped and qualified for experimental testing, inspections of the run of goods at factories, and servicewvalue determination through field inspections. This avoids the necessity for repetition of examinations by different examiners, frequently with inade- quate facilities for such work, and the confusion that would result from conflicting reports on the suitability of devices and materials examined fora given purpose. It is the intent of this Code that factory-installed internal wiring or the construction of equipment need not he inspected at the time of installation of the equipment, except to deteet alterations or damage, if the equipment has heen listed by a qualified electrical testing laboratory that is recognized as havitig the facilities describedin the preceding paragraph and that requires suitability for installationin accordance with this Code. Suitability shall be determined hy applicationof require- ments that are compatible with this Code. Informational Note No. 1: See requirements in 110.5. Inforinational Note No. 2 Listedis defined in Article 104. Informational Note No. 3: Informative Annex A containsa list of product safety standards that are compatible with this Coda 90.8 WiringPlanning. (A) Future Expansion and Convenience.

(B) Number of CircuitsinEnclosures. It is elsewhere provided in this Code that the number of circuits confinedin a single enclosure be varyingly restricted. Limiting the number of circuits in a single enclosure minimizes the effects froma short eircuit or ground fault. 90.9 Units ofMeasurement. (A) Measurement System of Preference. For the purpose of this Cade, metric unitsof measurementare in decovdance with the modernized metric system known as the International System of Units (SI). (B) Dual System of Units. SI units shail appear first, and inch- pound units shall immediately follow in paretitheses. Conver- sion from inch-pound units to SI units shall be based on hard conversion except as provided in 90.9(C). (C) Permitted Uses of Soft Conversion. The cases given in 90.9(C)(1) through (C)(4) shall not be required to use hard conversion and shall be permitted to use soft conversion. (1) Trade Sizes. Where the actual measured size of a product is not the same as the nominal size, trade size designators shall be used rather than dimensions. Trade practices shall be followed in all cases. (2) Extracted Material. Where material is extracted from another standard, the context of the original material shall not be compromised or violated. Any editingof the extracted text shall be confined to making the style consistent with that of the ® Industry Practice, Where industry practice is to express units in inch-pound units, the inclusion ofST unit shall not be required. (4) Safety. Where a negative impact on safety would result softconversion shall beused. (D) Compliance. Conversion from inch-pound units to Sl units shall be permitted to he an approximate Conversion. Compliance with the numbersshown in either the SI system or the inch-pound system shall constitute compliance with this Cade. Informational Note No. 1: Hard conversion is considered a change in dimensions or properties of an item into new sizes that might or might not be interchangeable with the sizes used in the original measurement. Soft conversion is considered a direct mathematical conversion and involves a change in the description of an existing measurement but not in the actual dimension. Informational Note No. & SI conversions are based on IEEE/ ASTM SI 10-1997, StandardfortheUsebfthe InternationalSystenof Units(81): TheMudernMelvic System. 70-81 CHAPTER 1 Chapter 1 General 4 ——r—al Scope.

A fuse rated in continuous amperes not to exceed three times the ampacity of the conductor, or a circuit breaker with a trip setting of not more than six times the ampacity of the conductors, shall be considered as providing the required short-circuit protection. Informational Note: See Table $11.60(C)(67) through Table 311.60{0) (86) for ampacities of conductors rated 2001 volts to. 35,000 volts. Overcurrent devices shall conform to 230.208(A) and (B). (A) Equipment Type. Equipment used to protect seryite- entrance conductors shall meet the requirements of Arte ele 490, Part IL (B) Enclosed Overcurrent Devices. The restriction to 80 percent of the rating for an enclosed overcurrent device for continuous leads shall not apply te overcurrent devices installed in systems operatingat over 1000 volts. 230.209 Surge Arresters. Surge arresters installedin aceord- ance with the requirements of Article 242 shallbe permigred-on gach ungrounded overhead service conductor. Informational Note: Surge arresters may be referred to as light ning arresters in older documents. 230.210 Service Equipment — General Provisions. Service equipment, including instrument transformers, shall conform to Article 490, PartI. 230.211 Switchgear. Switchgear shall consist of a substantial metal structure and a sheet mel enclosure, Where installed over a combustible floor, suitable protection thergwo shall be provided. 230.212 Over 35,000 Volts. Where the voltage exceeds 35,000 volts between conductors that enter a building they shall terminate in a switchgear compartment or a vauli conformingto the requirements of450.41 through 450.48. Part. General 240.1 Scope. Parts I through VII of this article provide the general requirements for overcurrent protection and overeur- rent protective devices not more than 1000 volts, nondnal, Part VIII covers overcurrent protection for those portions of supervised industrial installations operating at voltages of not mate than 1000 volts, nominal. Part IX covers evercurresnt protection over 1000 volts, nominal. Informational Note: Overcurrent protection for conductors and equipment is providedto open the circuit if the gurrént reaches a value that will cause an excessive or dangerous temperature in conductors or conductor insulation. See also 110.9 for require- ments forinterrupting ratings and 110.10 for requirementsfor protection against fault currents. 70-97","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
