Summary In electrical power systems and their associated market frameworks, actions close to or during real-time (i.e. the time of power delivery) may be critical to ensuring that: 1. Supply and demand are balanced, and that the power system is operated within its technical envelope. 2. Market participants can maximise revenues from their generating and/or demand-side resources. However, real-time actions and their outcomes are, to some degree, dependent on decisions made ahead-of-time — e.g. starting a gas turbine, charging a battery energy storage system and maintaining a greater level of spare capacity in reserve during periods of system stress. Given physical and financial uncertainties, no ahead-of-time decision is perfect; instead, they are made in light of the best available information, which includes demand, generation and market price forecasts (Mays et al., 2022). Though the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) lacks the ahead-of-time market platforms that are present in many restructured electricity industries in Europe and North America (Cramton, 2017; Roques, 2021), market participants provide resource and market offer information to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). AEMO then uses these submitted data alongside demand and renewable energy generation forecasts to run several centralised ahead-of-time processes (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020, 2021b, 2022). These processes produce ahead-of-time information, or “forecasts”, that market participants can use to inform their operational decision-making1, and that trigger AEMO to prepare for (or, in the worst case, undertake emergency actions before or during) periods of potential system risk (Australian Energy Market Commission, 2021). NEMSEER is a Python 3 package that facilitates access to and analysis of historical ahead-of-time operational information from AEMO-run processes. Specifically, it enables users to download data from these processes, manipulate it using pandas (The pandas development team, 2020; Wes McKinney, 2010) or xarray (Hoyer & Hamman, 2017) data structures, and cache the data in Parquet (Parquet, 2023) or netCDF (NetCDF 4, 2022) formats. Other major dependencies used by NEMSEER include attrs (Schlawack, 2022), requests (Psf/Requests, n.d.) and tqdm (Costa-Luis et al., 2023). 1That is, how they participate in the central dispatch process that is used to clear the gross-pool markets in each region of the NEM. Prakash et al. (2023). NEMSEER: A Python package for downloading and handling historical National Electricity Market forecast data produced by the Australian Energy Market Operator. Journal of Open Source Software, 8(92), 5883. https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05883. 1 Statement of need AEMO publicly releases data from five of its operational ahead-of-time processes: • 5-minute pre-dispatch • Pre-dispatch • Pre-dispatch Projected Assessment of System Adequacy • Short Term Projected Assessment of System Adequacy • Medium Term Projected Assessment of System Adequacy However, significant effort and prerequisite knowledge is required to obtain and process this data for analysis. Firstly, a user must be familiar with how AEMO’s data repositories are organised. Secondly, a user must have knowledge of what type of data each ahead-of-time process generates (i.e. the range of tables and columns available), and of each process’ lookahead horizon (i.e. for a given time at which the process is run, how many periods into the future are forecasted?). Finally, a user must download, unzip and clean CSV files before being able to load and handle tables of interest using data analysis tools. NEMSEER solves these issues by: 1. Providing learning resources and references (via the README and a glossary in the documentation) that unpack what each ahead-of-time process does and what data they offer. 2. Making it easier to download and handle this data. NEMSEER can inform the user of the date range of available data, which data tables are available and even generate the appropriate range of run times for a set of forecasted times that a user is interested in. Once a user queries a subset of data, NEMSEER will download, unzip and process the CSV files into pandas or xarray data structures. Though existing software solutions (e.g. NemSight, ez2view and NEOpoint) can provide access to some of the same data, most lack a programmatic interface useful for deeper analysis and all are proprietary commercial software. Furthermore, NEMSEER adds significant value to users interested in deeper analysis through its documentation. It contains examples showing how users can analyse demand forecast errors and energy price convergence using pre-dispatch demand and price forecast data (obtained using NEMSEER) and historical actual NEM system and market data (obtained using NEMOSIS) (Gorman et al., 2018). Figure 1 is an output of one such example. Prakash et al. (2023). NEMSEER: A Python package for downloading and handling historical National Electricity Market forecast data produced by the Australian Energy Market Operator. Journal of Open Source Software, 8(92), 5883. https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05883. 2 Figure 1: NEM-wide time of day demand error percentiles for 2021 for hour-ahead demand forecasts (i.e. those run during 5-minute pre-dispatch, or 5MPD). NEMSEER use cases include: • Modelling system operator or market participant decision-making under uncertainty. The latter could involve using pre-dispatch market price forecast data to understand the implications of using imperfect information to schedule energy storage systems (ongoing work by Prakash (2022/2022)), or calculating price forecast errors that are used as inputs for stochastic modelling frameworks (e.g. Yurdakul & Billimoria (2022/2023)). • Identifying periods of interest for market bidding behaviour analysis. Significant diver- gence of the actual market price from forecast market prices (as explored in the energy price convergence example) might be due to participants changing their market offers as conditions change. • Obtaining specific NEM data that is only published in ahead-of-time datasets. This includes some dynamic risk measures (e.g. capacity that would be lost in a credible contingency) and “sensitivities” that explore changes to market prices and interconnector flows across a range of demand change scenarios in each market region of the NEM (Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021a).
