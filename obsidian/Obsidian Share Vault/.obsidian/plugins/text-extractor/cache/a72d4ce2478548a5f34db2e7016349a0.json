With the launch of ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI in November 2022, large language models and generative AI have become a global, overnight sensation. That’s because generative AI can save time and effort, ultimately boosting workforce productivity. But to understand the true potential of generative AI, we must consider other types of artificial intelligence, including causal and predictive AI, which amplify the value of generative AI. Think of it this way: Generative AI—artificial intelligence that generates content, such as text, programming code, images, audio, videos, and more— is only as good as the underlying data that feeds its algorithms. Causal AI is an AI technique that identifies the precise cause and effect of events or behavior. Because causal AI pinpoints the root cause of an issue, not just correlation, it can deliver the precision needed to drive generative AI when, for example, DevOps engineers need to query a system using generative AI. Predictive AI uses machine learning, data analysis, statistical models, and AI methods to predict anomalies, identify patterns, and create forecasts about future events. Together, these three forms of AI enable greater insight. “Only predictive AI can see into the future reliably, only causal AI can deterministically know the root cause of an issue…and only generative AI can tailor recommendations and solutions to specific problems using advanced probabilistic algorithms,” said Bernd Greifeneder, Dynatrace chief technology officer, in a Forbes article on the three forms of AI. Together, Dynatrace dubs these three forms of AI “hypermodal AI.” These three forms of artificial intelligence have been critical for IT teams as data explodes, and organizations turn to AI to manage cloud environments, secure data, and improve business decision making. Better together: Generative, causal, and predictive AI amplify value As this guide indicates, organizations benefit most when they use these three forms of AI together, because they enhance one another. The first article in this guide outlines the importance of generative AI. It notes that generative AI is having an impact on organizations, from customer service to content creation to improving workforce productivity. But as the article notes, organizations can maximize the impact of generative AI by combining it with causal AI. This helps eliminate getting generic or How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value ©2023 Dynatrace 3 inappropriate answers when posing queries. This combined approach provides reliable answers in two ways: First, to drive trustworthy automation that is deterministic and repeatable through causal AI. Second, for causal AI to provide a deep, rich context to unleash LLM’s full potential for software delivery and productivity use cases. In the second article, we outline how causal AI operates on its own and with generative and predictive AI. As the second article notes, causal AI uses fault-tree analysis to determine system-level failures based on component-level failures. As a result, causal AI enables automatic anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, security risk ranking, and business impact assessment. While causal AI can identify issues in a system’s current state, it needs predictive AI to forecast future events and enable preemptive action to prevent future issues. The third article describes how predictive analytics can help identify potential issues or opportunities, enabling proactive actions to prevent problems or capitalize on advantageous situations. By identifying subtle deviations in system behavior, engineers can take preemptive measures to avert potential downtime, performance issues, or security threats. And by analyzing past incidents and performance metrics, predictive analytics helps site reliability engineers and DevOps engineers identify areas for improvement. This data-driven approach fosters the ability for teams to continuously refine processes and systems. Ultimately, these three forms of AI enable teams to ask well-founded questions, identify the root causes of issues, and even preemptively address issues before they become problematic. Finally, the fourth article outlines how predictive, causal, and generative AI work together in the Dynatrace platform. In the article, the authors write, “Predictive AI and causal AI provide deterministic answers and reliable automation, while the precise context additionally enriches generative AI for automatic or user-created prompts.” Read on to learn how predictive, causal, and generative AI work better together. Lauren Horwitz Editor in Chief Dynatrace How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value ©2023 Dynatrace 4 ARTICLE 1 The path to achieving unprecedented productivity and software innovation through ChatGPT and other generative AI ChatGPT and generative AI have become a global sensation, grabbing headlines and sparking debates around the world. Although generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technology is in its early stages and comes with risks, it has the potential to transform industries, including software development and delivery. Paired with causal AI, organizations can increase the impact and safer use of ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies. With the launch of ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI in November 2022, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI made their way to the top of boardroom agendas and household discussions worldwide. GPT technology and the LLM-based AI systems that drive it have huge implications and potential advantages for many tasks, from improving customer service to increasing employee productivity. ChatGPT and generative AI: A new world of innovation Software development and delivery are key areas where GPT technology such as ChatGPT shows potential. For example, it can help DevOps and platform engineering teams write code snippets by drawing on information from software libraries. In addition, it can expedite how teams resolve problems in custom code by feeding root-cause context into a GPT, augmenting problem tickets or alerts with this context, and using it as the base for auto-generated remediation. ©2023 Dynatrace 5 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value These examples reflect dramatic improvements over existing, time-wasting manual processes, including writing routine and easily replicable code or trawling through countless Stack Overflow pages before finding an answer. GPTs can also help quickly onboard team members to new development platforms and toolsets. The technology lets people learn about solutions by typing questions into a search bar, such as, “How do I import and export test cases between my environments?” and “What’s the best way to integrate this solution with my toolchain?” Again, this GPT approach represents a significant productivity and user satisfaction improvement over the current paradigm, where users search documents manually, and the ability to find answers depends on the quality and structure of the resources provided by vendors. Establishing guardrails to protect intellectual property and data privacy As DevOps and platform engineering teams use GPTs to accelerate software development, site reliability engineers (SREs) and privacy teams must ensure these technologies have the proper controls to avoid creating more problems than those they’re solving. First, SREs must ensure teams recognize intellectual property (IP) rights on any code shared by and with GPTs and other generative AI, including copyrighted, trademarked, or patented content. It will be equally critical for organizations to prevent ChatGPT and similar technologies from inadvertently sharing their IP or confidential data as they increasingly use repositories such as GitHub in their software development. Organizations should also consider regional and country-specific privacy and security regulations such as GDPR or the proposed European AI Act to ensure that their teams don’t use GPT technologies in a way that could inadvertently lead to data breaches or fines. Organizations will be in a much better position to maximize the impact of generative AI by combining it with causal AI. Understanding the risks of GPT and generative AI Organizations must be especially mindful that the LLM-based generative AI that powers ChatGPT and similar technologies is susceptible to error and manipulation. It relies on the accuracy and quality of the publicly available information and input it draws from, which may be untrustworthy or biased. In software development and delivery use cases, those sources could include code libraries that are legally protected or contain syntax errors or vulnerabilities planted by cybercriminals to perpetuate flaws that create more exploit opportunities. Engineering teams will, therefore, always need to check the code they get from GPTs to ensure it doesn’t risk software reliability, performance, compliance, or security. ©2023 Dynatrace 6 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value Mastering prompt engineering: The growing importance of causal AI While developers provide their code and comments as context for GPT tools, DevOps, SRE, and platform engineering teams feed this context into the generative AI using prompt engineering techniques. To do this effectively, the input from prompt engineering needs to be trustworthy and actionable. For example, if GPT tools only have access to general input about a CPU spike, they will just provide general answers about the need for additional CPUs or scaling. But if the GPT tools have access to precise details about the conditions behind the CPU spike, they can provide a specific response with a detailed root cause. Achieving this precision requires another type of artificial intelligence: causal AI. Causal AI, like the AI at the core of the Dynatrace platform, draws precise insights in near-real time from continuously observed relationships and dependencies within a technology ecosystem or across the software lifecycle. These dependency graphs or topologies enable causal AI to generate fully explainable, repeatable, and trustworthy answers that detail the cause, nature, and severity of any issue it discovers. Combining causal AI with GPTs will empower teams to automate analytics that explore the impact of their code, applications, and the underlying infrastructure while retaining full context. Increasing the impact of ChatGPT and generative AI In the future, combining generative AI and causal AI to increase the impact and value of ChatGPT and related technologies could become even more powerful and unlock additional use cases for driving productivity and efficiency in software delivery. For example, by integrating GPTs into the Dynatrace unified observability and security platform, we can combine natural language queries with causal AI-powered answers to provide accurate and clear context. This precise input engineering makes the GPT’s proposals more precise and actionable for remediation and automation. DevOps and platform teams can use this capability to ask questions such as, “How can I improve the response time of my application?” or execute commands like, “Create an automated workflow that scales my cluster based on actual user experience and my service level,” and get precise recommendations for a solution. ©2023 Dynatrace 7 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value Generative AI and causal AI are better together The impact of GPT technology will undoubtedly be profound, and the rapid pace at which people worldwide are adopting it will dramatically affect how many of us work. However, the adage, “garbage in, garbage out,” is highly pertinent. ChatGPT and similar technologies don’t provide solutions by themselves. Their proposals are only as good as the quality, depth, and precision of the information and context that organizations feed them. Organizations will be in a much better position to maximize the impact of generative AI by combining it with causal AI to ensure they avoid getting highly generic or misfitting answers. This combined approach provides reliable answers for two key purposes. First, to drive trustworthy automation that is deterministic and repeatable through causal AI. Second, for causal AI to provide a deep and rich context to unleash GPT’s full potential for software delivery and productivity use cases. After addressing security and privacy concerns, DevOps and platform engineering teams can leverage automated prompt engineering to feed their GPT with real-time data and causal AI-powered context. This will allow GPTs to drive productivity with suitable and meaningful suggestions. Combining causal AI and generative AI will eventually give rise to the next phase of GPT-powered innovation. DevOps and platform engineering teams will use causal AI to verify the output of their generative AI—such as code snippets—to ensure they don’t introduce reliability or security problems. They will also use intelligent automation to execute their reliable and secure code automatically. As engineering teams progress along this journey, organizations can build a lasting competitive advantage by achieving significant productivity gains and accelerating the speed of software innovation to levels many people would previously have considered impossible. How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value ©2023 Dynatrace 8 ARTICLE 2 What is causal AI? Why this deterministic AI approach is critical to business success Today's organizations need to go beyond a traditional, correlation-driven approach to identify the underlying causes and effects of an event or behavior and drive better DevOps automation. Enter causal AI. Organizations need to solve increasingly complex human problems, making advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) more important than ever. Conventional data science approaches and analytics platforms can predict the correlation between an event and possible sources. But they often fall short when it comes to understanding why an event occurred. That’s where causal AI, also referred to as deterministic AI, makes a crucial difference. In what follows, we’ll discuss causal AI, how it works, and how it compares to other types of artificial intelligence. We’ll also discuss why it’s essential for business success in the age of generative AI. What is causal AI? Causal AI is an artificial intelligence technique used to determine the exact underlying causes and effects of events or behaviors. Unlike correlation-based machine learning, which calculates probabilities based on statistics, causal AI uses fault-tree analysis to determine system-level failures based on component-level failures. With this systematic, top- down approach, causal AI and modern deterministic AIOps provide a determinative basis for automatic anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, security risk ranking, and business impact assessment. Causal AI draws on supporting data, such as relationships, dependencies, and other context among network entities and events. With this context, causal AI determines the precise root cause of an issue. This approach helps teams to develop effective models or interventions for change while ©2023 Dynatrace 9 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value also predicting their potential effectiveness. It can increase confidence in business and IT decision making by clearly connecting events to an intended or unintended outcome. The deterministic quality of causal AI can also form the foundation for reliable recommendations from emerging generative AI technologies. Why is causal AI important? Most AIOps approaches use predictive analytics that apply algorithms and machine learning to historical data to predict future outcomes. Such an outcome could be a CPU spike that progresses into a system failure. Predictive analysis helps an organization manage resources and improve incident response times. This blind spot between the underlying cause and resulting effect can lead to unwanted bias and poor decision making. Predictive analysis can observe an event and predict an outcome will occur, but it can’t show that the outcome occurred because of the event. In other words, correlation doesn’t equal causation. Causal AI, on the other hand, identifies the underlying cause of an event and its precise relationship to the outcome. Organizations can use causal AI frameworks and algorithms to ask questions and gain a deeper understanding of their CloudOps, DevOps, and SecOps use cases. For instance, these questions can include the following: • Why aren’t customers completing their transactions? • What’s causing customer churn? • Why is this application sluggish at certain times of the day? Additionally, the deterministic AI approach of causal AI can determine the cause-and-effect relationship of events from a combination of metrics, traces, and log data, as well as user behavior data and other details. Thus, teams can resolve incidents immediately to prevent disruptions in service and keep an organization in compliance with service- level agreements. ©2023 Dynatrace 10 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value Correlation AI vs. causal AI: Weighing the differences Correlation-based machine learning models predict outcomes from statistical relationships and are useful in many scenarios. Examples include facial recognition, personal shopping, and predictive maintenance. However, the shortcomings of correlation-based AI become evident when teams need to determine how an action would affect an outcome. While predictive models can identify the likelihood of certain positive or negative events happening, they’re unable to explain how they arrived at that forecast. They’re also unable to identify the underlying factors and cause-and-effect relationships. Correlation-based AI and causal AI have a few additional differences, including the following: Correlation-based AI Causal AI Correlation-based AI relies on statistics to provide assumptions about what’s happening. Causal AI can clearly trace and explain exactly what’s happening at every step based on specific contextual data. Correlation-based AI is probabilistic and requires humans to verify the accuracy of results. Causal AI is fact-based and thus can do automated analyses. Correlation-based AI can make only predictions with limited ability to explain an event. Causal AI provides details on how it arrived at a conclusion. Correlation-based AI needs to be checked for bias due to the limitations of various data, algorithms, or sampling. Causal AI relies on actual data and not training data and is therefore not prone to bias issues. Correlation-based AI may be completely off base in novel situations. Causal AI can adapt to new situations and find unknown unknowns. ©2023 Dynatrace 11 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value How does causal AI work? Causal AI essentially works in two steps. First, it collects information and discovers problems within the data set. Then, it looks for causal relationships that help explain those issues using a plan devised from the collected data. To better understand how causal AI works, it’s important to understand fault-tree analysis—a data- driven, fault-tree methodology used for causality analysis. Fault-tree analysis uses boolean logic to explore system-level failures. It’s a top-down approach used to identify the component-level failure, or basic event, that caused the system-level failure, or top event. Causal AI that uses fault-tree analysis works the following way: 1. Defines the scope of the system and what’s considered a failure. 2. Defines top-level faults and the analysis starting point with details of the failure. 3. Identifies precipitating events that could cause the top-level fault to occur, whether alone or with multiple concurring events. 4. Finds the root causes of each precipitating event and event sequence. 5. Analyzes the fault tree by looking for the events that lead to failure or are most likely to fail. With the certainty of this systematic approach, teams can gain insight into ways to mitigate paths to failure and support system improvements, and automate resolutions. Applying causal AI to your organization Dynatrace Davis® AI offers continuous causal analysis to the code level that maps and understands the relationships between all of an organization’s networks, applications, and services. Using fault- tree analysis, this causal AI approach seamlessly combines topological context with metric data to quickly identify observability signals for any behavior of interest. The analysis provides insights into every entity a problem affects, enabling developers to solve problems without having to reproduce errors. With its deterministic AI approach, causal AI provides the perfect basis for automating responses and supplying facts for reliable generative AI recommendations. ©2023 Dynatrace 12 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value ARTICLE 3 What is predictive AI? How this data-driven technique gives foresight to IT teams Predictive AI uses statistical algorithms and other advanced machine learning techniques to anticipate what might happen next in a system. By analyzing patterns and trends, predictive analytics enables teams to take proactive actions to prevent problems or capitalize on opportunity. Technology and operations teams work to ensure that applications and digital systems work seamlessly and securely. They handle complex infrastructure, maintain service availability, and respond swiftly to incidents. But when these teams work in largely manual ways, they don’t have time for innovation and strategic projects that might deliver greater value. Therefore, the integration of predictive artificial intelligence (AI) in the workflows of these teams has become essential to meet service-level objectives, collaborate effectively, and boost productivity. What is predictive AI? Predictive AI uses statistical algorithms and other advanced machine learning techniques to anticipate what might happen next in a system. Predictive AI uses machine learning, data analysis, statistical models, and AI methods to predict anomalies, identify patterns, and create forecasts. By analyzing patterns and trends, predictive analytics helps identify potential issues or opportunities, enabling proactive actions to prevent problems or capitalize on advantageous situations. ©2023 Dynatrace 13 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value When predictive AI is combined with a data lakehouse, like Dynatrace Grail, it can deliver value by automatically providing prescriptive insights using data from the digital user experience layer to the infrastructure layer with full data context using supporting data, such as relationships, dependencies, and other context within entities and events. While investigative techniques such as root-cause analysis are essential for teams striving to understand issues that have already occurred, predictive AI techniques such as forecasting and anomaly prediction help teams preempt issues. With the advances in causal AI (that is, AI that can explain cause and effect by identifying root-cause issues), teams want to take it to the next level and combine it with predictive AI to create a seamless foresight-to-hindsight continuum of data-driven answers and prescriptive insights. The importance of predictive AI for ITOps, DevSecOps, and SRE teams Early detection of anomalies. Predictive AI empowers site reliability engineers (SREs) and DevOps engineers to detect anomalies and irregular patterns in their systems long before they escalate into critical incidents. By identifying subtle deviations in system behavior, engineers can take preemptive measures to avert potential downtime, performance issues, or security threats. Proactive resource allocation. Through predictive analytics, SREs and DevOps engineers can accurately forecast resource needs based on historical data. This enables efficient resource allocation, avoiding unnecessary expenses and ensuring optimal performance. Capacity planning. Understanding future capacity requirements is crucial for maintaining system stability. Predictive AI assists engineers in predicting demand fluctuations and adjusting resource capacities accordingly, ensuring seamless user experiences. Enhanced incident response. Predictive analytics can anticipate potential failures and security breaches. SREs and DevOps engineers can implement targeted remediation strategies and prioritize incident response efforts to minimize the impact on systems and users. Continuous improvement. By analyzing past incidents and performance metrics, predictive analytics helps SREs and DevOps engineers identify areas for improvement. This data-driven approach fosters continuous refinement of processes and systems. ©2023 Dynatrace 14 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value Predictive AI-based capacity management and automation Proactive capacity management is essential for avoiding outages and ensuring that an organization’s applications and services are always available. Operators need to closely observe business- critical resource capacities such as storage, CPU, and memory to avoid outages that are driven by resource shortages. However, traditional capacity management approaches are often reactive and time-consuming. Using Dynatrace Grail and Davis AI, predictive capacity management is straightforward: • use Notebooks to explore important capacity indicators; • create workflows to trigger forecast reporting at regular intervals; and • use Davis AI for Workflows to automate the prediction and remediation of future capacity demands. Predictive capacity management is a powerful tool that can help improve the availability and performance of applications and services. By using Dynatrace Grail and Davis AI, you can gain the insights you need to make proactive decisions about capacity planning and gain additional benefits: Increased visibility into future capacity demands. Predictive capacity management can help you to anticipate what your future capacity demands will likely be. This provides organizations with the ability to make proactive decisions about capacity planning, such as adding additional resources or scaling back resources that are not being used. Improved decision making for capacity planning. With predictive capacity management, you can make more informed decisions about capacity planning. This is because you have a better understanding of your future capacity demands and the impact of those demands on applications and services. Reduced costs associated with unplanned capacity increases. Unplanned capacity increases are costly. Organizations may need to purchase additional resources or pay for overtime. Predictive capacity management can reduce these costs by enabling organizations to plan for future capacity demands. Increased customer satisfaction. When your applications and services are available and performing well, your customers are happy. Predictive capacity management can help you to improve customer satisfaction by reducing the number of outages and performance problems. This is just one example of predictive AI in action. But in fact, that there are numerous use cases for ITOps, DevSecOps, and SRE teams where they get the foresight into issues before they escalate into costly problems. They see improved efficiency, reduced risks of security breaches, and better compliance with industry regulations.

Hypermodal AI, which combines predictive AI, causal AI, and generative AI, boosts productivity across operations, security, development, and business teams. The combination of AI techniques is vital for observability and security use cases Generative AI is a transformative technology for delivering productivity gains. Observability, security, and business use cases raise additional challenges as they need precision and reproducibility. ©2023 Dynatrace 17 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value Large language models (LLMs), which are the foundation of generative AI, are neural networks: They learn, summarize, and generate content based on training data. When a user asks a question, generative AIs create an answer word by word. They predict the probability of the next word or sequence of words given the input prompt. They employ probabilistic sampling techniques and allow controlled randomness to diversify responses. This means that the same prompt or question will provide different responses. Because this randomized, probabilistic approach is not rooted in precise causal data, a pure generative AI approach renders use cases that require precision impossible. Davis AI combines AI techniques for precise and reliable outcomes: • Predictive AI and causal AI provide context to Davis CoPilot. They automatically enrich prompts with specific information, which provides better recommendations and precise, reproducible results. • Davis CoPilot generative AI doesn’t only react to user inputs. It can also be triggered automatically by predictive AI or causal AI events (for example, to recommend remediation actions automatically). ©2023 Dynatrace 18 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value Hypermodal AI unleashes exponential value: Step-by-step example In this example, a user builds a Dynatrace dashboard for all business-critical services that will be at risk during Black Friday. The steps required to complete this task can be categorized as either predictive , causal , or generative . Understand the meaning of questions. Identify all user sessions that contain conversion metrics (using Smartscape). Identify all services that are needed for these user journeys (topology using Smartscape). Predict how these services will behave under a higher load based on historic data. Choose the services that are nearing their limits (topology metrics). Choose the services that caused problems in the past. Use input to generate a dashboard and queries. Determine if remediation workflows should be set up. ©2023 Dynatrace 19 How combining predictive, causal, and generative AI can deliver amplified AI value Dynatrace Davis® AI provides answers and automation, and boosts productivity for multifaceted use cases Automatic root-cause analysis Davis AI automatically detects user-facing issues and assesses their impact on the business and affected users.
