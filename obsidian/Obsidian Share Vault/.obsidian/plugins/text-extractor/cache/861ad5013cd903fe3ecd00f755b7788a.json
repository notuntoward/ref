As marketers strive to capture and retain consumer attention, the methods and metrics used to measure this elusive concept have evolved. While traditional metrics like viewability have laid the groundwork, it’s clear that a more comprehensive approach to measuring attention is needed to drive meaningful business results. To better understand how attention is related to performance, Integral Ad Science (IAS) conducted extensive research, which included studies with media experts and observational analyses based on data from our more than 280 billion digital interactions captured daily. ATTENTION IS A MEASURE OF WHETHER OR NOT AN AD RESONATES WITH CONSUMERS AND CAN BE LINKED TO BUSINESS RESULTS Through IAS’s advanced machine learning model for Quality Attention™, we analyzed the complex relationship between attention metrics and business results, revealing that high attention signiﬁcantly enhances campaign performance. This ﬁnding demonstrates the critical importance of focusing on a holistic approach to measuring attention — encompassed by visibility, situation, and interaction signals. Quality Attention TM combines these signals to estimate the propensity of a conversion event or click, offering more actionable insights than traditional proxy metrics, like standalone viewability or time-in-view. TAKING ACTION ON ATTENTION: VOLUME II | 4 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 KEY INSIGHTS This iteration of Taking Action on Attention builds on our original point of view, where we highlighted the three attention signals (visibility, situation, and interaction), the metrics included in each signal, and their ability to drive results. Taking Action on Attention: Volume II showcases our attention model in action, with a deep-dive into Quality Attention TM as well as proven results from Total Visibility TM data and a series of case studies. As the industry shifts toward more sophisticated measurement techniques, it's clear that attention is emerging as a critical metric for driving ad performance. By implementing a robust attention-focused strategy, marketers can achieve signiﬁcant improvements in media performance and ROI. This white paper provides marketers with the insights and tools necessary to harness the power of attention. Through IAS’s data-driven insights, marketers can be better equipped to navigate the digital landscape and ultimately drive superior results across campaigns. *“The Attention Payoff,” Integral Ad Science, November 2023. **Results based on IAS Total Visibility TM data of U.S. media experts believe an effective attention strategy is crucial for their company* 83% CONTINUED lift in conversion rates among high attention impressions compared to low attention impressions** 130% of media experts measured attention in 2023, but more than half relied on proxy metrics* 88% lower cost per conversion compared to low attention, representing a $1.43 savings in cost per conversion** 51% TAKING ACTION ON ATTENTION: VOLUME II | 55 In Taking Action on Attention: Volume I, IAS addressed that attention, while seemingly similar to engagement, is a much more nuanced and elaborate concept. In fact, attention consists of its own set of metrics that indicate whether or not an ad resonates with consumers and can be linked to business results. While viewability is still a crucial starting point to understanding attention, the latter is a more accurate indicator that someone paid attention, increasing the likelihood that action will follow suit. “Attention is another stepping stone along the path to outcomes-based measurement.” — eMarketer “In the attention economy, every second counts. For brands, serving ad content that can hold a viewer’s attention for longer not only leads to greater engagement, enhanced brand recall and improved trust with the consumer, it also positively affects their bottom line.” — Forbes “Attention metrics can combat banner blindness by ﬁnding new places for marketers to focus when tried-and-true placements are ignored.” — AdExchanger Attention is nothing new in digital advertising, but it’s still one of the most complex topics in the industry. Marketers remain divided on how to properly harness it, with attention scores, methodologies, and key performance indicators increasingly diversiﬁed among marketers and industries alike. “Taking Action on Attention: Volume I,” Integral Ad Science, April 2023. INTRODUCTION Continued on next page ATTENTION CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR TALKING POINT ACROSS THE INDUSTRY TAKING ACTION ON ATTENTION: VOLUME II | 66 BUSINESS RESULTS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR AN ATTENTION STRATEGY: In the same study, media experts already measuring attention said they were most interested in upping media performance KPIs (time-in-view, video ad completion, brand safety and suitability, viewability, ad fraud rates, and return on ad spend) and revenue opportunity KPIs (new sales leads, purchase intent, online or offline sales lift, and offline visitation lift). When it comes to branding KPIs, although media experts may have ranked this lower, attention plays a key role in inﬂuencing upper funnel attitudes, especially for results like awareness and purchase intent. Attention is becoming the gold standard in media measurement. In a recent IAS study, The Attention Payoff, we saw that a majority (83%) of U.S. media experts think having an effective attention strategy is important for their company. Plus, nearly nine-in-10 media experts measured attention in 2023, but 54% of them did so with proxy metrics, like standalone viewability or time-in-view. Proxy signals were an initial starting point, but they’re unable to truly indicate performance. In Taking Action on Attention: Volume II, we’ll explore the dynamic link between attention and business results. We’ll dive deeper into the set of metrics that make up results-driven attention and explore fresh, innovative ways to capture genuine consumer attention. Plus, we’ll highlight how an attention-centric strategy can supercharge your media performance and boost your bottom line, with practical tips and insights to help you drive superior results across your KPIs.

A proper attention measurement product must inform actions that drive results and account for 1) media visibility, 2) environment of impressions, and 3) the interaction by consumers. These three signals, when measured and optimized against, have the ability to drive proven results. Experts across the industry broadly agree about the three essential signals for effective attention measurement and optimization. In The Attention Payoff study, up to 88% of U.S. media experts agreed about the importance of the three signals of attention: visibility, situation, interaction. As media quality assurance methods evolve to meet emerging demands, media experts will increasingly rely on attention measurement that drives results. Powerful tools combining key signals of visibility, situation, and interaction through the power of machine learning technology will be essential to elevate campaign performance. IAS has dedicated several years to research that shows the importance attention plays across the funnel of incremental measurement. Through this research, we created a data-driven machine learning model for Quality Attention TM that provides the value brands are looking for. THAT’S WHERE QUALITY ATTENTION TM COMES IN “The Attention Payoff,” Integral Ad Science, November 2023. “Taking Action on Attention: Volume I,” Integral Ad Science, April 2023. TAKING ACTION ON ATTENTION: VOLUME II | 99 A SUPERIOR STRATEGY: QUALITY ATTENTION TM HOW DOES QUALITY ATTENTION TM WORK? One of the most critical ingredients in an effective attention approach is the actionable data that informs media strategies and unlocks proven results for marketers and their campaigns. IAS Quality Attention TM is powered by an advanced machine learning model that estimates the propensity of a conversion event or click for each impression. A higher attention score is associated with a higher probability for a conversion event or click. The IAS model uses signals obtained through core measurement capabilities — such as viewability, media type, traffic type, and user interactions — along with data from Lumen’s proprietary model based on one of the world’s largest consumer attention biometric data sets. Between all the signals captured for each impression, there are over 50 million complex relationships and combinations to account for where the human eye and brain aren’t able to observe. By leveraging advanced machine learning, IAS can take these inputs and convert them into data that provides the most actionable insights.

A decade after the Media Rating Council established viewability, it’s still regarded as a crucial metric in digital advertising. After all, if an impression isn’t viewable, it’s highly unlikely to drive any results. It’s a critical aspect of attention too: Quality Attention TM builds off of valuable viewability data, factoring in more than 20 signals that indicate beyond if an ad was seen or not.

The studies focused on upper funnel brand lift and lower funnel sales lift, respectively, for two global beverage brands. CASE STUDY 1 QUALITY ATTENTION TM DRIVES BRAND LIFT FOR CPG BRAND THE GOAL A global media agency and their client, a leader in the CPG beverages industry, wanted to understand how higher attention scores can drive better results across their KPIs, which included brand awareness and purchase intent. THE RESULT IAS partnered with Upwave to understand the correlation between attention scores and brand awareness and purchase intent for the CPG brand. Using a traditional control/exposed methodology, the study showed that higher attention drove full funnel performance for the CPG brand.

In the two CPG brand case studies, the average attention score was 63 — which is just above the global CPG average of 62. This slightly higher attention average and the impact of the placements with the above average scores is key to understanding how to drive future campaign success. IAS’s Quality Attention TM product provides a global averages tool that gives marketers access to attention scores alongside a global average across all eligible impressions. This tool provides additional averages by region, vertical, and subvertical to provide marketers with key points of comparison to help evaluate their campaign’s attention performance. The Quality Attention TM global averages tool is refreshed quarterly, giving marketers the ability to benchmark campaign performance with regularly updated metrics. IAS plans to continue to extend the Quality Attention TM global averages tool with even more insights, including providing averages by ad format and device.
