*** *Emacs to try*
    My experiments, Emacs packages I've tried and installed (from Melpa repository). Also, some builtins I could try
***** *TRY*
******* TRY get git and ref out of TempoBox, leave papers there
        - checkout ref dir in a folder not connected to TempoBox
        - symbolically link 'papers' to inside of newly checked out ref dir
          - papers too big for bitbucket (git)
          - Symoblic link means that new ref dir can't be on OneDrive
        - then, changes to .emacs/howto.org/... are ONLY transmitted with git
******* TRY Improve elpy python path: [[Better elpy path]]

        Use conda.el hooks?

        *problem*: elpy requires
        (elpy-use-ipython)
        but can't run this until know what conda environment (path to perl, iconsole, etc.) is known

        Can conda.el call it after it has determined the environment e.g. with a hook?

        Can conda.el get the path to the anaconda dir some other way than via an environment variable or by walking up the path of a python command, like I did at first?

        Actually, conda.el DOES have hooks!

  ;; hooks -- TODO once we actually have environment creation / deletion

  (defcustom conda-preactivate-hook nil
    "Hook run before a conda environment is activated.")

  (defcustom conda-postactivate-hook nil
    "Hook run after a conda environment is activated.")

  (defcustom conda-predeactivate-hook nil
    "Hook run before a conda environment is deactivated.")

  (defcustom conda-postdeactivate-hook nil
    "Hook run after a conda environment is deactivated.")

******* TRY remove percent from mode-line

        Problem with percent
        1.) Percent is redundant with line count, and can see the same info on the scrollbar.  
        2.) it blocks out clock when viewing .emacs on a normal-width emacs window
        
        This [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/modernization_mode_line.html][guy]] points out that scrollbar is not present in terminal mode.

        So leave it there in terminal mode, remove it if GUI?

******* TRY virtual buffers: do I like them?
        I've turned it off to see if I care.

        removed customization ido-use-virtual-buffers
        commented out (ivy-use-virtual-buffers t)

        would expect to notice the difference in at least
        
        ido-switch-buffer
        ivy-switch-buffer

        Right now, I don't use this from shorcuts -- I'm using ibuffer

******* TRY decide on <<highlight symbol>>

        _Three alternatives, neither perfect_

        highlight-thing is actively maintained, more flexible, [[https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs#interface-enhancement][more popular?]] faster? (no fontlock), can be restricted to defun.  The change it needs is to query "describe-symbol" or something when it's in "symbol" mode and then only highlight if it's a symbol. Better yet, only if it's a variable, so "describe-variable", if that exists.

        Related to [[smartscan]] and [[iedit]]

********* highlight-symbol
;; /doesn't restrict to defun/, has nav keys, also highlights words in comments
;; alternative, only in defun: https://github.com/fgeller/highlight-thing.el

          Seems like I could easily do this by just copying my current settings but I don't want to do all this manually in my .emacs file -- seems like it would interfere with other things that might want to change the mode-line.

          Also, this text is fixed, not updated.

          Also, emacs seems to deal with =mode-line-misc-info=, which contains the time string and other stuff, as a variable. I don't see how to break it up.

            Comment: 
            Since you asked for a specific mode-line-format this isn't a proper answer, but smart-mode-line right-aligns the mode-line-misc-info by default, and it can right-align the list of minor-modes by setting sml/mode-width to 'right. – Malabarba Dec 18 '14 at 21:51

*********** This puts the clock on the RHS but obliterates my modeline faces
            From [[https://github.com/Malabarba/smart-mode-line/issues/116][here]]

            I added to my .emacs

            (use-package smart-mode-line
            :ensure t
            :config
            (setq sml/theme 'respectful)
            (setq sml/no-confirm-load-theme t)
            (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'sml/setup)
            (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'display-time)  
            (setq display-time-24hr-format t))

            *Unfortunately*, 'respectful wasn't that respectful, and changed fonts to black and green so they're invisible on my dark blue modeline, and it also messed up the 'inactive' face.

            I commented out the sml/theme line so that the fonts were picked automatically: Better, and mostly legible but I don't love it.

*********** TODO *Fix* with: =sml/customize= and =sml/customize-faces= ?
************* setting sml/theme to "don't use a theme." fixes color problems
              Actually, you have to

              (setq sml/theme nil)

              in order for this to work across emacs sessions.

(use-package smart-mode-line
  :ensure t
  :config
;;  (setq sml/theme 'respectful) ;; let it figure it out
;;  (setq sml/theme 'light)
(setq sml/theme nil)

              actually, it's the same font if you compare screenshots of w/ and w/o sml
************* DONE what is that red x when have modifed a file? do I care?

******* TRY put '#' in dedicated target link 

        Will prefer to match with dedicated links (but didn't [[][]] already do that?)

        http://orgmode.org/manual/Internal-links.html

        This is somehow _incompatible with org-ref_.  If I test the example org file from [[https://github.com/snosov1/toc-org][GitHub - snosov1/toc-org: toc-org is an Emacs utility to have an up-to-date t...]]

        and put my cursor on, or C-c C-o on any of the links referencing a headline (could also be referencing a dedicated target), I get errors like this:

           Error running timer ‘org-ref-link-message’: (error "No match for custom ID: Installation")

        /DOES toc-org insert custom ID definitions that org-ref would not crash on?/

        *ANYWAY* _the change to my .emacs for # targets would be:_ 

          (defun create-and-link-dedicated-org-target (callPrefix)

          Changing the line:
	    (kill-new (concat "[" targBdy "]"))
          To this:

        For some things, I like ido better:
        - See [[Swiper]]
        - compunaut [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/51lqn9/helm_or_ivy/][says]] that [[https://github.com/compunaut/helm-ido-like-guide][setting helm up like ido]] makes it match ivy better, if want to use helm chunks
********* TRY speed up swiper on energy.bib and energytop.org
*********** the swiper-grep thing helped but did not solve it
*********** it is said that visual line mode slows down swiper
********* TRY make an <<ivy gridmode>> like [[https://github.com/larkery/ido-grid-mode.el][ido-grid-mode]]

          o ivy grid would be especially nice in M-x (although counsel-M-x does show keys).  I asked (see [[Swiper]]).

          gridmode is more efficient. I asked if ivy could do this, and abo-abo said [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/962]["No, but try ivy-format-function"]]

          [[help:ivy-format-function]] default
          *[[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/ivy-20170416.1021/ivy.el][-->>
              ]]* [[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/ivy-20170416.1021/ivy.el::"Transform%20CAND-PAIRS%20into%20a%20string%20for%20minibuffer."][ivy-format-function-default]] 
              -->
                  [[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/ivy-20170416.1021/ivy.el::(let%20((i%20-1))][ivy--format-function-generic]]

          can see that these functions just take a list of items from a lower level ivy function, cancatenate a seperator and return.

          To make grid mode, would change

            [[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/ivy-20170416.1021/ivy.el::(let%20((i%20-1))][ivy--format-function-generic]]

          which makes a string that goes in the buffer.  It's just a vertical list, with one on each line, because a newline is inserted after each item in the list.

          Would need to
          o set a screen width
          o set a max file width
          o set a screen height
          o decide max # items per row
          o rewrite this function to only insert newlines at the row ends

          What I don't understand is where the highlighting for matches in this display is applied.  If it's after a call to this function, it seems like I'd have to change A LOT.  If it's before them, and the highlighting is somehow transferred, then it's not too much.

          Maybe the faces are added, like for the default function, [[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/ivy-20170416.1021/ivy.el::(ivy--add-face%20str%20'ivy-current-match))][here]].

          *What I would like*:  Generally, preserve outline structure but still have two way links.
          - Definition of a concept
            - explicitly define with org dedicated target, or similar
            - make every headline be an idea
              - easy but...
              - many headlines aren't really an idea
              - would have problems with headlines containing unintended duplicate text
          - Two sources of dependency: explicit and org-tree
            - explicit: done by a two-way link
            - org-tree parent/child/sibling relationships come from org outline
              - sibling: under same headline (immediately or total)
                Two kinds of sibling
                - headline is defined as a concep
                  - explicitly
                  - or by a setting that makes all headlines a concept (tons of siblings)
                - headline has no concept
                  - would have a ton of sibling relationships in this view
                  - but easier
              - parent: this idea is a headline over some other idea
              - child: this idea has a headline with some other idea in it
          - If currently on X, then Y is shown as related to X
            - in an outline, X is a parent of Y, X is a child of Y, X is a sibling of Y
            - an explicit two-way link has been made
          - Three views: parent of, child of, sibling of
            - _X is parent of Y_
              - show X's (narrowed) tree containing Y, expanded to highest sub level where Y shows up

            I have
              (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'highlight-indent-guides-mode)
            but it only works for elisp, so I have to manually do

            A [[ https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/4741][thread on this problem]] says it could be a programming mode in scratch

***** *ACCEPTED*
******* ACCEPTED enable shift-arrow select, for uniformity with Windows/Linux

        *Conclusions*: 

        1.) set [[help:org-support-shift-select][org-support-shift-select]] to *'always'*
            /[[Using customization instead of .emacs setq]]/
        2.) retain my existing windmove =C-arrows= bindings

        *Why*:

        The default org setup [[help:org-support-shift-select][uses]] =C-arrows= for
          1.) *headline*: change TODO state (left/right) and priority (up/down)
              /I've been doing =C-c C-t= forever, so I don't care/
          2.) *plain list*: change the bullet type
              /this would be a little nice but I don't use it/
          3.) *time stamp*: change the time
              /never use/
          4.) *property definition*: switch between allowed values
              /never use/
          5.) *BEGIN line of a clock table*: change time block
              /never use/

        These bindings [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Conflicts.html][conflict]] with:
          1.) Windows/Linux style shift-select: I might like this consistency
          2.) [[help:windmove-default-keybindings][windmove]] (but I had already mapped these keys to =C-arrows).
              o =C-arrows= used to move cursor by word/paragraph, but I used M-f/b
              o =C-arrows= consistent w/ buffer move: I'd [[
                      (][mapped]] it to =C-S-arrows=

        If customize [[help:org-support-shift-select][org-support-shift-select]], then shift select works
          o *'t'**:* in text but not in special regions (bullet cycling is modified)
          o *'always'*: works everywhere except on a timestamps

        Done.  See ~/.emacs (defun sdo/uniquify-like-buffer (vm-unique-filename)...)

        I've installed this.  It works unless the packages being tried has undownloaded dependencies, it seems.

******* ACCEPTED get a recent directories like recent files

        I picked bjm/ivy-dired-recent-dirs (Method #1 below).

        I thought about ido'izing it, and making uniquifying like recent files are, but actually, I like the plain ivy binding better, so I'm keeping it as it.

        Here are two ways to make recent directories.maybe one is easier to idoize?

          1. [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/open-a-recent-directory-in-dired-revisited][Method #1]] using ivy directly
          [[From: http://blog.binchen.org/posts/use-ivy-to-open-recent-directories.html][2. Method #2]] using counsel
             Calls executable "fasd" which I don't see in my IWES path.
             There is also an emacs fasd package, but this also wants the binary???

******* ACCEPTED Decide mappings: C-c b, C-c r *VS*. =C-x 5 c= etc. *VS.* Prefix
      
        *Conclusion*: New mappings will be

          C-x C-f: find file (as always)
          C-x 4 f: find file other window (easier than fully consistent =C-x 4 C-f=)
          C-x 5 f: find file other frame

          C-x C-r: find recent file (mimicking C-x c-f since it's also a file)
          C-x 4 r: find recent file other window
          C-x 5 r: find recent file other frame

          C-x c:   clone buffer (like files but avoids =C-x C-c= (kills emacs))
          C-x 4 c: clone buffer other window
          C-x 5 c: clone buffer other frame

          C-c b:   org-iswitchb (/generalize to "files of same mode"/)

********* C-x 5 r vs. C-5 C-4? *C-x 4, *C-x 5 are better*

            *Conclusion*: C-x 4 and C-x 5 would be consistent w/ frame and window functions ([[Emacs key binding conventions]])

*********** For recentf, C-x 5 C-r is a little clumsy.
*********** could use a prefix: C-4 C-r, C-5 C-r but C-x 4/5 r is following a standard
*********** or did I make that up in my own .emacs file
      
********* C-c b (C-c 5 b) and C-c b (C-c 5 b)? *C-c b and C-c c are OK*
*********** I can use C-c since I'm a user ([[Emacs key binding conventions]])
*********** I had already mapped C-c b to clone-indirect-other buffer
************* Nice b/c easy to type, and C-c 5 b would be easy too
************* BUT it wrote over org-iswitchb which restricts to org files (also NICE)

*********** For uniformity: I could also do C-c b, C-c 4 b, C-c 5 b
************* Easy to type
************* Consistent with C-c b

********* Save C-c b binding to clone-indirect-buffer-other-window? *No*

          Conclusion: redefining C-c b would not be a sacrifice since I never used my C-c b binding anyway.  And it was kind of inconsistent.

          Also, somebody else uses this as "org-iswitchb" which I think is more consistent, somehow.  Note: org-iswitchb might have a sensible use for C-u prefixes.  See the help for this function.  This might generalized to other modes e.g. for C mode: C-u could mean to ".h" files, etc.

********* Use prefixes args (e.g. C-u)? *No*

          Conclusion: It seems like prefixes arguments are best for binary command options (C-u) and this isn't binary.  Also, I don't have a consistent idea for the other ones, while I do notice that C-x 4 and C-x 5 are almost always bound to window and frame functions

        Maybe make the default behavior a prefix option in a new function that looks something like ~sdo-swiper-region~

        =M-%= already has a bunch of prefix args, and also has a fancy way of making the previous isearch string the replacement target (see help on M-%).

        *Keep it.*

        org-autolist makes org-mode lists behave more like lists in non-programming editors such as Google Docs, MS Word, and OS X Notes.

        When editing a list item, pressing "Return" will insert a new list item automatically. This works for both bullet points and checkboxes, so there's no need to think about whether to use M-<return> or M-S-<return>. Similarly, pressing "Backspace" at the beginning of a list item deletes the bullet / checkbox, and moves the cursor to the end of the previous line.

        Works on '-' lists and checkboxes, not headlines ('***').  But it
        works and is handy.  Must enable org-autolist-mode so it works.  See
        instructions in the doc below (I've done that now).

      org-autolist is an available package.

          Archive: melpa
          Version: 20150922.705
          Summary: Improved list management in org-mode
         Homepage: https://github.com/calvinwyoung/org-autolist
         Keywords: lists checklists org-mode

      `org-autolist` makes org-mode lists behave more like lists in non-programming
      editors such as Google Docs, MS Word, and OS X Notes.

      When editing a list item, pressing "Return" will insert a new list item
      automatically. This works for both bullet points and checkboxes, so there's
      no need to think about whether to use `M-<return>` or `M-S-<return>`. Similarly,
      pressing "Backspace" at the beginning of a list item deletes the bullet /
      checkbox, and moves the cursor to the end of the previous line.

      To enable org-autolist mode in the current buffer:

        (org-autolist-mode)

      To enable it whenever you open an org file, add this to your init.el:

        (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-autolist-mode)))

        It's simple and it works.  A bit like pasting note links in Evernote.

          Version: 20160319.500
         Requires: emacs-24.4
          Summary: insert org-mode links from the clipboard
         Homepage: http://github.com/rexim/org-cliplink

      A simple command that takes a URL from the clipboard and inserts an
      org-mode link with a title of a page found by the URL into the
      current buffer

      This code was a part of my Emacs config almost a year. I decided to
      publish it as a separate package in case someone needs this feature
      too.

******* ACCEPTED different screen font for ~code~ and =verbatim=
******* ACCEPTED map mouse buttons to emacs functions e.g. mouse-4 and mouse-5 (browser back/forward)
        Ideas
********* I don't know,... try to use org-mode with a mouse and see
********* C-x b (bufer history)
********* winner mode
********* buffer movement (winmove commands, although maybe that's stupid, since I would have my hands on a mouse)
********* undo/redo (with undo-tree?)

******* ACCEPTED [[help:narrow-or-widen-dwim]]
******* ACCEPTED think of new home/end since it's a mess on SP4
        didn't these used to be M-[ and M-]? Use for page up/down?  I don't know, but they are now.
        Done: Home/end is now a hydra of []
******* ACCEPTED swiper
******* ACCEPTED write functions anchor-create and anchor-link
        I'm always making anchors from headline titles and then turning around and linking them.  Make it simple:
        *dedicated-target-create:* makes an dedicated-target (<<XX>>) and either
           o puts it in the copy buffer so it can be pasted somewhere
           o pastes it itself on the line below the current headline
           o XX can come from
             o selected text
             o the full headline
             o what you type in

        *dedicated-target-link*: creates a link to an dedicated-target ([[[[XX]]]]) and puts it in copy buf
           o you paste it where you want
           o XX can come from
             o copy buffer leftover from of *dedicated-target-create*
             o putting the cursor on an dedicated-target (it's extracted)
             o putting cursor on a dedicated-targetless headline
               (it calls *dedicated-target-create* to make the dedicated-target)

******* ACCEPTED fix ediff of org files

        Answer: turn off folding before ediff, following instructions [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/21335/prevent-folding-org-files-opened-by-ediff][here]] in .emacs

        M-x font-lock acts like a literal toggle.  Can you ediff that way? NO.

        add toggle-literal() to =M-apps= hydra?. NOT needed so delete this from .emacs

******* ACCEPTED [[gscholar-bibtex]]
******* ACCEPTED counsel-descbinds in hydra
          It's overall better than ido binding search
            better than: instant search (ido: must switch to to buff and search)
            better than: ivy-resume goes back to it
            worse: always in minibuffer; ido uses big side buff if available.

******* ACCEPTED remove dependency upon align-equals.el

      Used script in https://gist.github.com/WaYdotNET/700416
      which has many other align functions too.

        Bindings for [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TransposeFrame][EmacsWiki: Transpose Frame]]

        *But do I need this?*  Existing =C-|= can already do what I want, I think.

        *NOPE* C-| is enough.  Don't do this.

        See .emacs, one already used, horizontal and vertical flipping might be useful
        ;; make a hydra for the frame transpositions?
        ;‘flip-frame’ … Flip vertically

        An idea for =M-app=?
******* REJECTED icicles (needed by some other package or is this a leftover?)

      I guess I like the X-windows style of pasting and don't find the control problem that hard.

      just add (setq mouse-yank-at-point t)
      do I really use middle click mouse anymore?, like in X?

******* REJECTED [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/selected.el][GitHub - Kungsgeten/selected.el: Keymap for when region is active]]
        Uppercases a region and stuff.  But I don't need this very often, and the standard M-u, etc. is fine

******* REJECTED org-wunderlist

        MS is killing Wunderlist and integrating into Win10.  This is very unlikely to survive, especially since [[https://github.com/myuhe/org-wunderlist.el][last checkin for org-wunderlist was 2015]]

        Would be nice to sync org mode w/ phone and browser.  Wunderlist has been
        bought by MS so maybe it will survive a while.  Could try this and switch
        from Google Keep to Wunderlist (but will MS kill Wunderlist?).

        Anyway, there are apps for windows 10, android, and browser interace.

******* REJECTED anzu modeline display
        [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-anzu][GitHub - syohex/emacs-anzu: Emacs Port of anzu.vim]]

        A nice little display of the number of matches of an isearch string, displayed on the mode-line. But I wasn't using it because I started using swiper instead of isearch.

        One nice thing about it, though, is that it somehow knoew to put itself on the right side of the modeline.  

        I'd like to do do that for (display-time-mode 1), where time would go on left side of modeline.

********* Using [[Pandoc]]
*********** Manually

          make a Word file
            pandoc -f org -t docx -o tmp.docx tmp.org
          make a .org file
            pandoc -f docx -t org -o tmp2.org tmp.docx

          This really works!  The org-mode outline structure shows up as an outline structure in Word, and on the docx-->org step, the org structure is retained.

          Problems
          - I had was a syntax error when I tried to convert my whole howto.org file.
          - the docx-->org version has those annoying :PROPERTIES: drawers, which weren't there before.  I guess I could just delete them.

          Kind of annoying: must create a reference document using pandoc and then edit that to create the styles you want.  Can't directly use, for example, a conference paper template; you'd need to manually make the pandoc docx template look like the paper template.  Anyway...

            pandoc myfile.txt -o reference.docx

          where myfile just says "hello world" or something.  Then use Word to edit reference.docx to taste.

******* How to make the org-ref latex compile: install TexLive
        <<How to make the org-ref latex compile: install TexLive>>

        The solution for org-ref was to [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref/issues/346#issuecomment-262874374][use latexmk]].  However, MikTex latexmk kept crashing on both home and work computers.  Since org-ref people were successfully using TexLive, I installed that instead (it can work with [[Lyx]], which is what it was using, but see the [[Lyx Tweaks for TexLive]]

        _IWES TexLive Problem_: The proxy was a problem, even if I disabled it in Chrome and deleted by http_proxy env var.  And I was unable to customize the TexLive environment to use a proxy because it insists upon using a URL proxy and IWES has only a numerical IP address.

        _IWES TexLive Solution_: Disable the proxy stuff in Chrome, delete
        http_proxy (not sure if necess.) & then hook up with the IWES guest Wifi.  Finally, I was able to do a normal TexLive internet install. I also had to add the path to the TexLive latexmk binary (C:\texlive\2016\bin\win32) to the PATH environment variable.  I don't remember needing to do this at home.

        Note also that, in .emacs, I had to modify the advice from
        https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref/issues/346#issuecomment-262874374
        (which I mention there).

As before, everything works starting from the leftover .tex file, for example, this makes a valid pdf:  latexmk -f -pdf tmp


********* why _latex bibtex latex latex_ works on org-ref leftover .tex file

Reasoning from [[http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/8332/undefined-citation-warnings][here]]:

Getting citations and references right always requires multiple runs of latex. The normal procedure is the following

latex <file>
bibtex <file>
latex <file>
"unlatex <file>

The _first compile_ finds all the cite commands and makes a list of them in the _.aux file_, and takes note of the bibliography style. No citations are resolved in your document yet.

Then _bibtex_ processes the aux file and using the bibliography style, and the list of citations creates a _.bbl file_ which contains the bibliography. No citations are resolved yet here either.

The _next latex_ compile doesn't resolve the references either, but reads the .bbl file and _keeps track of the citations_.

Finally the _last latex_ compile _resolves all the references_.

The warnings you receive are normal, and should really only be paid attention to after the last latex compilation in the steps above.

There are various scripts that automate some of these procedures so that you don't forget to do the multiple latex runs; one is latexmk and another is rubber.

Many text editors have access to these in some simple way, so before thinking about installing them you should find out if your editor already has a way to use them.

      From: [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/19333/how-do-i-turn-off-the-automatic-list-feature-in-org-mode][How do I turn off the automatic list feature in org-mode? - Emacs Stack Exchange]]

      *Turning off autonumbering for '.' or ')' or both*

        Customize:
          org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator

      *Making autonumber terminator vary with list level*

        To get a list like:

          1. item one
             1) subitem one
                1. subsubitem one
          2. item two

        ... make this customization

        ~(setq org-list-demote-modify-bullet '(("-"  . "+")~
                                      ~("+"  . "*")~
                                      ~("*"  . "-")~
                                      ~("1."  . "1)")~
                                      ~("1)"  . "1.")))~

      *Hierarchical list numbers* e.g 1., 2., 2.1, 2.2, 3., ...

        ~(setq org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator ?\))~

        Then org only allows order list bullets ending with parentheses, and won't recognize "2.", "2.1", etc., as bullets.

      1. mark files to be replaced (see also [[Dired file marking]])
      2. Q /and enter from regexp and replacement string/
***** directly editing file names (wdired, reach by C-x C-q)
      From [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/wdired-editable-dired-buffers][here(lots of tips)]]: you can edit dired like it was a file

      C-x C-q : start when in dired
      C-c C-c : save edits to really change filenames
      C-c ESC : undo all changes

*** Searching/Replacing
***** <<Swiper>>
      From: [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/dont-search-swipe/][Don’t search, swipe | Pragmatic Emacs]]
******* =C-s= to search (my mapping: was =M-app= but this wouldn't repeat previous search)
******* =C-s (again)= inside of swiper to go to previous search (across all buffers)
******* =C-r= gives a list of previous searches
******* =C-g= in swiper minibuffer will pop you back farom where you started
******* =C-o= in swiper activates hydra-ivy (if install package?)

        package Documentation is poor, though.  To see what it does:

        ~M-x describe-symbol hydra-ivy/body~

        Here's [[https://oremacs.com/2015/03/26/hydra-ivy-swiper/][a better idea for an ivy hydra]]
******* =space twice= to search for literal space (doesn't work for !, though)
******* =C-u C-SPC= after swiper exit returns to previous position w/ [[Mark-ring]]
        *isearch did this too!* I didn't know.
******* =M-q= [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/144][does query replace]] using the swiper string (and it does...)
******* can navigate somewhere else with search
******* can edit the current buffer while searching, and swiper minibuffer stays open
******* [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnJQpTFVDc][Video demo]]
********* (note: C-r doesn't work like he says in the video)
********* instead, it gives you a list of previous search terms
********* [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/412][guy complained]] but he doesn't want change it, suggested how, though
********* also supposed to do last search if hit C-s, but it does the one before that
********* Swiper (did he mean just 'ivy'? does marking, etc. in dired
          see video demo above, about 09:30
          but I think you must bind ivy everywhere?

          /But is built-in dired stuff actually just as good?/

******* [[ivy gridmode]]
***** Search for contents of marked region

      o =C-s= with a region selected, use it as the search string

      o =C-s=, =C-w=, =C-w=,... expands region of search hit.

******* Done by adding [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/202803/searching-for-marked-selected-text-in-emacs][jrh-isearch-with-region]] to .emacs
******* I also added [[http://emacsrocks.com/e09.html][expand-region]] from melpa, mapped that to M--

***** Search for word at cursor or contents of kill buffer(from [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/202803/searching-for-marked-selected-text-in-emacs][here]])

      Easiest is:
        C-s C-w (w/ more C-w's to expand region) also works well

      In general:
        C-s or C-r (gets into search)
        C-w (gets word following point. Can repeat to get more words)
        C-y (pastes kill buffer into search)

***** Search for "symbol" (exact) or word at point

      M-s .

      Nice b/c it parses the langauage you're in to figure out what a symbol is.  If you're pointing at a string, it expands isearches for the word at point.

***** C-s s will search for previous string (default emacs bindings)
***** search/replace German (and other chars)

      To u and o match German ü and ö, customize:

        search-default-mode  (Char-Fold Search)
        replace-char-fold    (on)

      My Emacs Stack Exchanage [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/32321/char-fold-search-match-for-german-eszett-%25C3%259F][question]] about ß

***** =M-%= search string comes from region, like =C-s= does
      Package [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/replace-from-region.el][replace-from-region.el]] works well so I'm using it now (April 2007)

      =M-%=: do query replace.  If region marked, use it to search, else standard
      =M-p, M-p=: go through past replace strings.  You can edit them.
      =arrowKeys=: act like  =M-p, M-p
      =M-n=: gets replacements from isearch, like ‘C-s C-s M-%’

      Emacs builtin, =query-replace=, originally bound to =M-%,= has many prefixes, which still work.

***** <<Replace within region or defun>>

      Handy for changing a string everywhere in a buffer at once, for example, changing a varible (which could be matched by string searc or by =M-s .=)

      _Two ways to do this_

******* <<iedit>> interactive replace of string/symbol in region/defun & more
        (also see [[Rectangle editing]] and [[smartscan]])

        _Simultaneiously replace through whole buffer_
        (once you are in iedit mode...)

        1. put cursor on symbol you want to edit (or mark some text)
        2. =C-;=
        3. type the replacement: all matches will be edited
        4. =C-g= or  =C-;= to exit

        _Replace within a narrowed region_

        1. select narrowed region
           a. select with mouse, or...
           b. select with expand-region. My binding: =C--=
        2. =C-;=
        3. type the replacement

        _Replace within a defun_ (options)

        1.) =C-0 C-;= matches [[help:iedit-mode][only within current function]].
            In org-mode, this limits matching to current list, etc.

        2.) [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/iedit-interactive-multi-occurrence-editing-in-your-buffer][iedit-dwim]] hack, works but maybe don't want it b/c there's
             no way to do full buffer. Also =C-0 C-;= is builtin ([[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/iedit-interactive-multi-occurrence-editing-in-your-buffer][my comment]])

        *Note*: doesn't =C-;= conflict with default binding for source block editing?

        Related to [[highlight symbol]] and [[smartscan]]

******* query-replace (default binding to =M-%=, no rebound)

        after have set up search (using tricks above).  Is a built-in.

        Especially handy for replacing /exactly/ a programming symbol instead of a string.  To do this, set up marking with:

          =M-s .=

        Replace default behavior is to "search and replace within the selected region" so it's not as easy to initiate a search string with a region.  Would require some hacking.

***** Replace history

      =M-p/M-n= scroll through past history.  You can edit the strings on either side of the arrows.

      Could use this to selectively undo replacements, do different replacements, etc.

***** Replace a string with a newline

      =M-x replace-string RET ; RET C-q C-j=

      =C-q= for quoted-insert,
      =C-j= is a newline.

*** UNDO: =C-/= and REDO: =C-g C-/ C-/ ...= and TREES
    From: [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3527142/how-do-you-redo-changes-after-undo-with-emacs][How do you 'redo' changes after 'undo' with Emacs?]]

    To undo once: C-/
    To undo twice: C-/ C-/
    To redo once, immediately after undoing: C-g C-/
    To redo twice, immediately after undoing: C-g C-/ C-/.
       Note that C-g is not repeated.
    To undo immediately again, once: C-g C-/
    To undo immediately again, twice: C-g C-/ C-/
    To redo again, the same…

    The =undo-tree= package is supposed (I thought) to add =C-?= and also a bunch of fancy tree stuff that I haven't figured out yet.

*** Yanking

    =C-y= yanks last kill (standard)
    =M-y= cycles back through yank ring after have done 1st yank (standard)
        /I've supplemented this binding with/ =counsel-yank-pop= (below)

***** =M-y= (my mapping) [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/counsel-yank-pop-with-a-tweak/][counsel-yank-pop with a tweak]]
******* don't need to type =C-y= first
******* M-y, just like in the old days, but..
******* can cycle both ways w/ =C-n=, =C-p=
******* can type partial strings to find things in string
******* can't paste into swiper like you can paste kill in into isearch
***** [[https://github.com/browse-kill-ring/browse-kill-ring][Browse kill ring]] (I'm not using this, but it sounds nice too)
******* Commenters here [[http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5707][seem to prefer it to counsel]]?
******* it's a package & there's also a brows-kill-ring+ package
******* Doesn't depend upon helm or ivy
******* But, since I've already got both ivy AND helm, I'll skip it
*** Zooming

    =C-x C-+= starts zooming
    =C-x C--= starts unzooming
    =C-x C-0= sets default scaling

    *Note*: Only need to type =+ -= = after =C-x C-+= or =C-x C--=

*** <<Narrowing/Widening: narrow-or-widen-dwim>>
***** good for org-mode
***** good for programming and other stuff too
*** <<Emacs key binding conventions>>

    *Conclusions* 
    1) I can bind C-c <letter> to anything (it's reserved for "users")
    2) other C-c bindings (number, punctuation,...) are for modes
    3) =4 and 5= are very commonly used for other frame and window funcs
    4) Prefix command argument =C-u= is OK for commands that have two behaviors
    5) I'm not sure what to do with other prefix command arguments

***** =4= means "other window"; =5= means "other frame"

      Looking at my (mostly) default emacs key bindings...
      
******* =C-x 4=: is mostly bound to things regarding windows
******* =C-x 5=: is mostly bound to things regarding frames
******* But other prefixes eg. =C-h,= are also associated with 4 and 5
        and mean other frame and other window

*** Navigation hydras: =M-<apps>=
    This is my binding.

    =helm-swiper=, mapped to =p= is a very nice occur.  In the end, I might get rid of the navigation hydra and just bind that.

*** Moving cursor to windows: =S-arrowkeys=
    (alternative to cumberson c-x 0)

    <S-arrowkeys>

    (these are windmove-* commands mapped in my .emacs)

    Note that org-mode still messes with TODOs if the cursor is on one.  I thought I had a setting that fixed that, but I guess not (April 2017).

*** Moving cursor through window/frame history with mouse

    Using mouse: use mouse-4 and mouse-5 buttons:

      _MS Sculpt_: swipe up/down
      _Logitech_:  side thumb buttons

    Requires these emacs bindings:

      ~(define-key global-map [mouse-4] 'next-multiframe-window)
      (define-key global-map [mouse-5] 'previous-multiframe-window)~

*** Moving windows around:    =C-S-arrowkeys=, =C-|=

    *C-S-arrowkeys*

    (these are buffer-move commands mapped in my .emacs)

    *C-|*

    rotates from horizontal to vertical splitting

*** Undo/Redo of window config: [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WinnerMode][winner-mode]]:

    A window config undo/redo, doesn't save to disk but very good anyway

      C-c leftArrow/rightArrow

      Doesn't save across sessions but I'll keep it because it's so simple.

    Could also use

*** <<Emacs symbols>>
    From [[help:xah-math-input]]

    For now, I'm using [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/xmsi-math-symbols-input.html][Emacs: Xah Math Input Mode]] (named, rather than shortcuts, and advantage?)

      1: Turn the mode on =xah-math-input-mode= or do it globally...
      2: type an ascii string
      3: hit shift-space:

      | ascii | result after shift-space |
      |-------+--------------------------|
      | =     | ≈                        |

*** TRY Hydras for window movement, moving cursor to windows, other window management
    https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/wiki/Window-Management
*** TRY <<Saving/restoring window sessions>>

    For now, I've bound ~ivy-push-view~, ~ivy-pop-view~ and ~ivy-switch-view~

    This is litterally a push and pop, so you lose configs as you pop (restore) them.  Seems like winner-mode is better?   


    I wish ivy-push/pop-view stored views but that's not there yet.  See my comment on a the ivy site here:

      OR set it up to autosave and restore every time you quit and restart

******* works, mostly, but _doesn't restore org mode indirect buffers_
        just get one copy of the org file, if a there was a window with an indirect copy, it is not restored
******* out-if-the-box: only 1 session name, can't name them
******* but maybe works if use desktop save mode for "buffers not visiting a file"
        See [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Desktop-Save-Mode.html][Desktop Save Mode - GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual]]

         (desktop-file-name file-name desktop-dirname)

******* [[https://bmag.github.io/2015/12/26/desktop.html][desktop-change-dir]] allows loading different sessions and switching

        _Just rebinding keys_:  Here's [[https://ericjmritz.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/emacs-desktops/][one guy's approach]]:

          C-c d c for desktop-clear
          C-c d d for desktop-change-dir
          C-c d s for desktop-save

        _Using a little elisp_:

          "Minimal Setup" [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;oldid=DeskTop;id=Desktop][here]] is a more elaborate idea

******* desktop+ breaks it (April, 2017), I think
        makes it write some buffer file to ~/.emacs.d
        but then fails because it's zero length
        doesn't write this file when desktop+ is installed
******* [[https://bmag.github.io/2015/12/26/desktop.html#desktop-buffer-mode-handlers][example]] of desktop-buffer-mode-handlers (would write one for indirect-bufers)
********* desktop+ does that but I don't understand the code
***** [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/315/using-desktop-for-basic-project-management][bookmark+ and desktop.el (desktop.el is now builtin, I think)]]: broken
      and more about similar ideas:
      https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;oldid=DeskTop;id=Desktop

      bookmark+ seems nice but it fails when I try to save a desktop. I get some kind of error message.  Also, doesn't save it in a default file: you have to specify each time.

      _Indirect buffers_: from [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/28964/how-to-save-a-desktop-with-narrowed-indirect-buffers][here]], it doesn't totally handle them but you can hack around this by saving a "sequence bookmark"

        Guy [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/76zw8x/restore_session_on_emacs_startup/][says]] emacs desktop.el is too hard to use (emacs maintainer disagrees), and that registers are best:

             My main window config is built with registers, 5 windows in 1 frame: Ibuffer, multi-term, Gnus, contacts, and calendar. It takes less than 30 seconds upon a restart, which I don't do often. That config is saved with a simple C-x r w m (for main). So a C-x r j m will always bring me back to that config.  desktop.el can save registers to a file, according to the maintainer.

      Can push and pop views. But saving them across emacs restarts is not builtin (can be hacked, see comments).  It also didn't work the first time I tried it, and I haven't tried it again.

      _winner-mode_ seems better, on balance
      - does nearly the same thing
      - simple arrow keys
      - also doesn't save across emacs restarts (a shared failing)
      - access is "backwards/forward," not random access as with ivy-push-view but that's OK

      You can also use (string=) which is usually easier to read

***** Installing

      1. Run the emacs windows installer e.g. Chocolatey or Vincent Goulet

      Running addpm.exe is no longer recommended, as of v 25.2.  From Chocolatey emacs [[file:c:/ProgramData/chocolatey/lib/emacs64/tools/emacs/share/emacs/25.2/README.W32][README.W32]]:

         This is no longer needed in latest versions of Emacs, so we recommend you not do that, as running addpm.exe will insert entries into the Registry which might get in the way if you upgrade to later versions without updating those entries, or would like to uninstall Emacs.

      3. Put emacs bins _on front of PATH_ env. var (for org mode compiles and
         to make file associations and taskbar stuff shorter).

      4. Set the HOME environment variable to where .emacs and .emacs.d are

      5. set the ALTERNATE_EDITOR env. var to runemacs.exe

      6. May need to create a blank dir called .emacs.d or do [[Windows .emacs.d problem]]

        2. set ALTERNATE_EDITOR env. var to runemacs.exe
        3. start runemacs.exe e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Emacs 24.4\bin\runemacs.exe

      I can't get this to work.  Maybe [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Windows-Startup.html#Windows-Startup][official Emacs Windows Tops]] would help?

      Set up so [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/efaq-w32.html#Associate-files-with-Emacs][new emacs doesn't start]] if old one is already running
      (the no-new-emacs part still doesn't work on emacs 25.1 and Windows 10)
      1. ALTERNATE_EDITOR to runemacs.exe. /not emacslientw?/  I tried both, doesn't matter. (if add path to emacs bin, this will be simpler)
      2. make sure .emacs has a (server-start)
      3. associate files using emacsclientw.exe /below/

      emacsclientw association, for example, for org files:

      1. Right click on a .org file
      2. Properties
      3. General tab
      4. Click on "Change" button next to "opens with"
      5. More Apps
      6. Look for another app on pc
      7. go to emacs dist bin and select emacsclientw.exe

      After this, other filetypes can be associated with emacs the normal way with OpenWith or properties (don't have to go "look for another app on pc")

      *Windows 10 Fail*: On Windows 10, as of 2016-11-29, the procedure above still started a new emacs window when you click on a, for example, .org file.  But on Windows 7, it (correctly) uses an existing emacs window.  The problem was that the (server-running-p) check in .emacs wasn't working, so the servers was never started.

      *Windows 10 Hack*: change .emacs to just always run (server-start)

******* old fixes that aren't necessary anymore on Windows 10, as of 7/17/16.

      Works almost perfectly except for flashing black window in Goulet
      emacs 24.5.  Mostly inspired by the article [[https://yoo2080.wordpress.com/2014/02/05/how-to-associate-file-types-with-emacs-on-windows-8/][here]]:

      1. make sure runemacs.exe is _on front of Windows PATH_ environment
         variable, so that the cygwin emacs is not seen first, which will
         cause confusion.

      2. create a batch file "Gnu Emacs Batch.bat" containing:

         emacsclientw.exe -na runemacs.exe %*

         I put this in ~/shareHW/config (which can be a symbolic link from
         OneDrive)

      3. Associate it with filetypes using windows explorer "open with"
         - in Windows Explorer, right click on file file you want to associate
         - "open with" (or "open" for 1st time: and then tick "installed
           program...", go there, and then step below)
         - make sure none of the standard programs e.g. Adobe Reader are
           not highlighted. If the are, right click to unhighlight
         - Seach button --> go to the location of the batch file and click "open"

      4. Change the icon for files of this extension
         - download [[http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html][FileTypesMan]]
         - run it from the zip file (no install)
         - double click on the .org extension entry
         - in the default icon window, put: C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU
           Emacs 24.5\bin\runemacs.exe
         - might as well type in a description for that file type
         - OK

      *Troubleshooting*
      - [[Fix connection actively refused error]]
      - get rid of flashing black window. From [[https://yoo2080.wordpress.com/2014/02/05/how-to-associate-file-types-with-emacs-on-windows-8/][here]], under "how to
        eliminate that temporary window and why does it show up?"

        either replace the .bat file w/ an executable or replace it w/ a
        change made in regedit with [[http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html][FileTypesMan]].

        I haven't tried either fix, and still have a flashing window


********* THIS ALSO DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE W/ Goulet emacs 24.5 / windows 7

        /NOTE/ You first have to make Gnu EmacsClient an option by
        associating the first file type with it by manually specififying
        the path to emacsclientw.exe.  After that, it will know that emacs is
        an option for opening files.

        For me, this changed the associations for all files of that type, not
        just the file I first right clicked on.

        For accidentally screwed up file extensions see: [[Remove bad file association]]

********* stuff that used to work but doesn't in Goulet emacs 24.5, windows 7
*********** solution 1 (problem: "Gnu EmacsClient" doesn't exist)

            By default, you get an extra black command window popup when you
            start emacs via a file association. Here's how to get rid of it (on
            Windows 8.1)

            o in File Explorer, right click on the file
            o properties
            o in the "general" tab, click "change" next to "Opens with"
            o click icon next to "Gnu EmacsClient"
*********** solution 2
           o (server-start) in .emacs
           o [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient][associate them with]] emacsclientw.exe -na runemacs.exe
             - make ~/bin/emacsBatch.bat, containing the line:
               emacsclientw.exe -na runemacs.exe "%1"
             - then associate it with filetypes using windows explorer "open with"
             - the above /did/ work and then I messed it up w/ some crappy shareware
             - stuff that doesn't work
               - setting environment variable ALTERNATE_EDITOR to runemacs.exe is
                 also supposed to work, but I couldn't get it to

    2. inserts a CR into the file, which won't necessarily match future frames
    3. filladapt breaks cperl, org-mode plain lists, maybe matlab?

        From: [[https://github.com/necaris/conda.el][conda.el: Emacs helper library (and minor mode) to work with]]

        *conda.el* has some problems to fix before I can use it
        1. it's bin paths are wrong for windows: [[https://github.com/necaris/conda.el/issues/5][Doesn't work on Windows · Issue #5]]
        2. always prints "env not found": [[https://github.com/necaris/conda.el/issues/8][No conda environment for file · Issue #8]]
        3. when I run =C-c= (ipython) I get a warning b/c I'm running a hard-coded conda path (the wrong one, since I'm hard coded to root)
        4. This might be b/c of my hard coded path: (setq conda-anaconda-home conda-home-dir).  Could use env var ANACONDA_HOME ([[help:conda-anaconda-home]])
        5. but then (elpy-use-ipython) would still crash since would not be in path.  letting conda.el autofind the path worked, and I think ipython was working because emacs ignores PATH changes but still had an ipython.exe in its path.  Maybe this is also an elpy problem?  Could pyenv help?  Also, on windows, python.exe is in the top env dir and ipython.exe is in topdir/Scripts.  Seems like conda.el doesn't handle that.

*** How I'd like to make JabRef more like emacs org mode
    (response to a JabRef web survey on 11/12/15)

    /Please, if you have anything else to suggest regarding the next versions of/
    /JabRef, use the following field./

    Make it easier to find the relationships between papers.  I've
    accumulated a couple thousand references and often forget how ideas
    I've seen before have something to do with what I'm looking at now.
    I think two things are needed: A better way to express these
    relationships; and a way to automatically discover them.

***** I. Paper Relationship Expression:

      I've reduced the problem of forgetting paper relationships by
      maintaining a giant topic file in emacs org mode; every time I
      enter a new paper in Jabref, I go to emacs and sprinkle the topic
      file with links to it.  Since a paper might be related to many
      topics, I often add many links -- the fact that there are many links
      unfortunately does not fit well into the hierarchical mindmap
      structure like that used in Docear.  Docear does have a cross-link
      capability but it doesn't work well when there are many cross-links.

      Better would be a "many-to-one" and "one-to-many" structure like
      that in a Concept Map.  Concept Maps allow both hierarchy and
      arbitrary relationship links -- they're really just directed graphs
      with a nice interface for grouping nodes and redrawing.  The best
      program I've found is at http://cmap.ihmc.us/ but it doesn't work
      well with BibTex).

      Anyway, Docear is mindmap based, so I'm sticking with org mode.  Org mode
      can do the same thing as concept maps, is simple plain text, is
      super flexible, and has hooks to every publishing tool I use.  It's
      clunky and not graphical but it works.  Docear is going in the
      right direction but the mindmap structure isn't expressive enough;
      maybe Jabref could build an interface to a concept map tool, or an
      arbitrary graph editor.

***** II. Paper Relationship Discovery

      I would love something like Evernote's approach.  Every time I save
      a web article, Evernote tells me about related articles I've already saved.  Restricting the search to stuff I've already
      saved is better than telling me about all the articles in the
      world that are related.  I haven't tried Docear's recommender
      system.  If it's searching the world, well, I already have google;
      if it's searching my own references first, then I'm really
      interested.

    like 3 fingered tap or 2 fingers + 1 finger to middle click and other
    stuff.  The link says it's compatible with Win8.1 even though the last
    version is 2009.  Anyway, copy it to somewhere (I used Program Files
    (86)) configure it and set it to start with Windows.  I also turned the
    "scroll type" to OFF, in case it interferes w/ the Synaptics driver.

    w/ two-finger-scroll, a 3-finger tap was recognized as both a two
    fingered tap (right click) and a middle button.  So, I set middle click
    to be two fingers + one tap with a third finger.

***** force cygwin to make windows-understandable symlinks
      <<windows-understandable symlinks>>

      Add "winsymlinks" to CYGWIN environment variable.  This makes cygwin
      create symlinks differently, in a form that is understood both by it
      and by Windows.  What it really does is make cygwin ln -s commands
      produce the

        *.lnk

      shortcut files that windows knows how to understand.  This works for
      windows and cygwin but not for emacsw32, which sees the .lnk
      extension and can't figure out how to follow it.  I can add a couple
      hacks in my .emacs files so that info from cygwin ls is used to
      properly display the link, but again, emacs can't follow it.  Since
      emacs couldn't follow the orignal cygwin link either, there's no
      loss, and this is a small step forward.

      o I added it to the windows system CYGWIN enviroment variable (which
        also had nodosfilewarning in it, see [[turn off cygwin DOS warning]])

      o But could also do it in .bashrc
        export CYGWIN="nodosfilewarning winsymlinks"

***** fix unable to remap to same address as parent
      Showed up when I tried to do an svn checkout with an ssh tunnel.

      The fix ([[http://www.mylifestartingup.com/2009/04/fatal-error-unable-to-remap-to-same.html][semi-complete inspiration]]):

      1. kill all cygwin windows and procs (I just rebooted)
      2. windows search for ash, then run as admin
      3. /bin/rebaseall -v
      4. reboot

      There was a problem w/ some Temp file in my userdir not being
      writeable.  To fix, I right clicked on the folder in windows explorer
      and changed the owner from admin to me.  This was the same procedure
      as for [[Windows .emacs.d problem]]

*** [[Windows Emacs]]
*** <<Windows symbolic links>>

    (example: link to dropbox DTU directory, .emacs files)  These are
    understood by cygwin, windows and emacs so they're the most general.
    They're different than windows shortcuts, which end in a .lnk extension
    and joins (I think) which delete the source file if you delete the
    link.  Windows symlinks do this.

***** command line
    open cmd.exe as administrator
    mklink /D DTU c:\Users\Scott\OneDrive\shareHW\DTU

    Remove /D to link individual files.  Also, for some reason, this works
    when file links are done straight through emacs command window (dos
    shell).  After CD'ing to the folder pointed to by the HOME
    envirnoment variable:

    mklink .emacs.gnu c:\Users\Scott\OneDrive\shareHW\config\.emacs.gnu
    mklink .emacs.xemacs c:\Users\Scott\OneDrive\shareHW\config\.emacs.xemacs
    mklink .emacs c:\Users\Scott\OneDrive\shareHW\config\.emacs

    *Note* to make the links followable, it may be necessary to change
     ownership from admin (what the default seems to be when created w/
     mklink) to scot, scotto, sotterson, or whatever my windows username
     is.   This is the same procedure as for [[Windows .emacs.d problem]]

      Upload center seems to make a separate copy of Office files and uploads them by itself -- redundant with OneDrive and worse, it crashes constantly at work.

      4. unclick the two boxes under

        UNCLICK: Office files synchronize with Office

      After a reboot, this is supposed to stop the Upload center uploads (and errors).  But in 2017, on Windows 7, the reboot did not seem to be necessary.

*** tasklist/taskkill (like Unix 'ps', and 'kill')

The tasklist command is designed to provide information about the tasks
that are running on a Windows 7 system. At its most basic, you can enter
the following command:

tasklist

The tasklist command has numerous optional switches, but there are a couple
I want to mention. One is the -m switch, which causes tasklist to display
all the DLL modules associated with a task. The other is the -svc switch,
which lists the services that support each task. Here’s how they look:

tasklist -m
tasklist -svc

Taskkill

The taskkill command terminates a task, either by name (which is referred
to as the image name) or by process ID. The syntax for this command is
simple. You must follow the taskkill command with -pid (process ID) or -im
(image name) and the name or process ID of the task that you want to
terminate. Here are two examples of how this command works:

taskkill -pid 4104
taskkill -im iexplore.exe

      Somehow, it disappeared: how to get it back so I can use bluetooth
      devices.

      There were 2 problems:

      1. Soluto had paused it (searched for bluetooth in soluto and found
         this)

      2. For some reason, the thinkpad BT driver was disabled.  I enabled it
         from the device manager.

******* If icon was accidentally removed (this wasn't the problem, this time)

      Two suggestions

      1. Regedit

         regedit (in windows menu)
         HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Bluetooth
         either delete this or set it to 1
         relogin or restart

         For me, it was already set to 1 so I just deleted it.  Also, the
         icon tray rectangle was full.  Possibly, windows 7 didn't know what
         to do w/ that, so it lost the BT icon?

      2. Type "bluetooth" in the windows menu: click "bluetooth settings" in
         the results.  But I don't see "bluetooth settings" so I must do the
         registry hack above.

There is a way, but it is quite complicated. You need to first pair the mouse with all the computers you want to share the mouse with. After your last pairing, use the follow the steps from this web posting to get the last pairing key saved as a registry file.
http://console.systems/2014/09/how-to-pair-low-energy-le-bluetooth.html
(note: not www. at the front)

You can then use the same tool Psexec to launch regedit with the required authorization and import this key registry file onto other windows computers to have them with the same pairing code last generated. You can even move this pairing key into Linux system.

I think this can let you use your mouse with unlimited other computers, but I don't know what would happen if they were all within bluetooth range at once.
If you ever put the mouse back into pairing mode again, you would have to transfer a new key file to all your other computer systems again.

    1. Find the file extension in question under this key in the registry:

       HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts

    2. Deleting the sub-key with the same name as the extension you want to
       un-associate will delete the default program association.

       You may also need to remove the same sub key from HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT

*** Fixing blurred fonts in Win 8

From [[http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/W-Series-ThinkPad-Laptops/Blurred-display-after-upgrade-to-Windows-8-1/ta-p/1282781][here]], this worked for emacs

Microsoft has released a [[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2900023][tech article]] about this.

When using Windows 8.1 on a computer with a display featuring a high
number of dots per inch (high-DPI), some desktop applications may
appear somewhat blurry as compared to other applications on the
screen.

In order to provide an optimal experience on high-DPI displays,
desktop applications need to detect the DPI of the display which is in
use, and scale their graphical elements, text, and screen layout
appropriately. Some applications do not implement this; thus they may
not look as sharp.

If there is not an updated DPI-aware version of the application
available, you may be able to alter the appearance of the application
by using one of the following methods. Note that this may result in
less desirable results, depending on the application.

  o Disable DPI virtualization for the application. To do this,
  right-click the application’s shortcut and then click Properties. On
  the Compatibility tab, select "Disable Display Scaling On High DPI
  Settings", and then click OK. This will cause the text in the
  application to appear clearer, but if the application does not
  properly handle high DPI settings, it may have adverse side effects
  such as truncated text or incorrectly sized graphical elements.


  o Lower the overall Windows DPI setting. To do this, open the
  desktop Display control panel (or search for "dpiscaling" from the
  Start Screen) and adjust the slider under "Change the size of all
  items". You may need to select the checkbox for "Let me choose one
  scaling level for all my displays" and change the scale to 100%.

Note that on very high-DPI displays, this may make screen elements very small, and some text may become difficult to read.

a b * Windows 8
18 February 2014 14:23:13

-Windows 8.x will do a lot of checks on a new drive, OEM don't properly format a drive these days, they just drop a image of the operating system on it. Windows 8.x will attempt to read and locate sectors on the drive, when it finds sectors that can be read but have read errors, it will attempt to read the data over and over to get a good copy and then relocate the data to another location on the disk. This process takes time and is started 5 mins after the system goes idle. For most people, use control panel power settings to high performances and just leave the machine on for a day or so it should just work itself out and the "problem" will go away.

-There are other things that can cause the same 100% disk use for example the system tries to guess what you want to do and will load programs into memory before you actually attempt to run them. Some files that are selected may not actually be currently loaded on your disk, they may be in the process of being downloaded or streamed. For example, you might have a game service that stores your games for you and lets you play a game while it downloads the rest of your games or parts of games in the background. If windows tries to prefetch these files into memory it will end up spinning waiting on the disk to provide the file, the disk is waiting on the network to provide the file, but the game service is loading the file very slowly in the background so it does not tie up your network bandwidth or CPU.

-there are also bugs with corrupted file systems that are pretty easy to fix with a chkdsk /f /r

- there some malware that now hide in the file system file streams
I would think that some virus scanners and malwarebytes should find these and remove them.

- I have seen issues where a the search index searches your hard drive and builds a database index
but the drive is corrupted and the search ends up having a loop so it never gets to the end of the file search,
it just keeps building a bigger and bigger index until all of your hard drive space is used up.
(just run chkdsk /f /r and delete the search index to fix)

- for most people, the problem just goes away after a few day, except on laptops that go to sleep fast.
it might take 8 hours of real time to scan and fix a disk with errors, more for a large disk. On a laptop
that goes to sleep in 15 mins after idle the OS will have only 10min to work on the task on each wake cycle.

if you really want to see what your system is doing you should get a copy of the tool rammap64.exe this is a tool written by a company called sysinternals. Microsoft bought the company and has the tools for free on its website http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb84206...

You can download the file and see all the files that are open on your system. you will be surprised what is getting preloaded into memory for you. I am looking at my list now and I see programs I have not run for almost a year and they are being preloaded. The system cache manager just fills the unused ram with what it thinks I might want to run. if one of these files were located on a disk with disk errors, it would take a lot of time to load the file into memory as the system attempts to read the disk over and over each time I boot.
even if I never requested the file to be run, the disk might queued up and running full speed because of this process. it is not really a bug in the cache manager that the disk has errors and causes the disk to spin at 100%, it is disk problem that has not crashed your system yet.

There can also be other problems that will slow a disk. Errors in the electronics, bugs in the chipset drivers, even a bad cable connection. thermal expansion/contraction on a cable connection can make and break a connection several times a second causing a drive to disconnect and auto reconnect several times a second. This really can cause your drive to slow down but it still works until the drive gets disconnected for 30 seconds then you get a logged error.

The same thermal contraction can cause circuits to fail. (brittle solder joints crack and lift off the circuit board)

I have looked into 100% disk usage on solid state drives and they have all been firmware related.
The operation of solid state drives really depends on having proper time to run their clean up routines. They really suffer on laptops that try to save their power. The drives have to run their garbage collection routines and their TRIM functions. When these get blocked because firmware bugs or lack of idle time while the machine is on the drive kind of gets wedged up to the point it can not function correctly. Often you just need to power on the machine and boot into BIOS and leave the machine alone overnight. The SSD will start its firmware internal garbage collection and can move bad blocks around and do its various repairs.
SSD have very limited ability to write to the drive. Figure 2000 writes to a block and that block is dead. It really does not take long to do that amount of writes. Just look at the amount of temp files being written by a browser like chrome to get a idea.

anyway, maybe what I said will give you a idea what the problem is.

        But unfortunately, I still wasn't able to view RW2 files on the

  In reply to mbulliva's post on April 6, 2016
  There is a relatively easy work around to install the Windows 8 camera codec into W10 so that you can view RAW files in Explorer and Photo Viewer.
  If you try and install the latest MS raw codec http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26829 it won't install because it will tell you that it is not compatible with Windows 10.

  A workaround is:
  1) Download the latest Windows camera codec (an msi file) from the link above
  2) Download this MSI editor Orca - http://www.brentnorris.net/blog/archives/319
  3) Open the MSI file in the editor and delete the line 'launch condition'. Save the file.
  4) Now launch the MSI file by double clicking on it. This will install the camera codecs and your will be able to view your raw files in Explorer and Photo Viewer

***** Windows explorer thumbnails

        The $10 version got me thumbnails in MS Windows Explorer but did

        images. Presumably FPV Pro would do that.

***** Convert to generic Adobe DNG files (doesn't work yet for Win10 Photos app)

      Convert almost any raw file to generic Adobe digital negative format
      and then view it in applications that can handle it:

      o Adobe products, of course, and maybe this is a way of extending old
        versions of non-subscription Adobe software e.g. photoshop
        elements.
      o OLD Windows Photo Viewer
      o NOT win10 photo viewer, as of Sep 14, 2016

keystroke to open the Firefox Add-Ons Manager. Click the “Extensions” tab,
and then click “Options” next to Clip to OneNote (Legacy Edition). Click
“Browse” next to "Path of OneNote.exe," and then select the "OneNote.exe"
executable file from the Office 2013 installation directory. By default,
the file is located within either the “C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Office15” or the “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15”
directories. Select the file, click “Open,” and then exit the Add-Ons
Manager.

*Add Content to OneNote*

To add an entire Web page to OneNote, right-click a vacant area within the

menu. Alternately, highlight any portion of text with your cursor, and then
right-click and select “Clip to OneNote Selection” to add only the
highlighted text.

Thanks very much for the tip, which makes this OneNote usability error tolerable.

Unfortunately, I can't map my volume key.  So, piling one hack on top of another, I mapped the Alt+1 to the quick access toolbar "hide the ribbon" toggle, and then I used the TouchMe Gesture Studio app to map Alt + 1 to a touch gesture.

Of course, we shouldn't be doing any of this; MS should just fix "Show Tabs
and Commands"

Try this:

If you know a bit about autohotkey that those other guys are talking about,
I have a totally automatic solution. Like the other solutions, place "Hide
the Ribbon" command from "More Commands" in the very first slot. Then,
paste this code into autohotkey.

;name this HideRibbon
RunMacro = 1
loop {
  Process, wait, ONENOTE.exe, 1
  NewPID = %ErrorLevel%
  if (NewPID != 0 and RunMacro = 1) {
    sleep 2500; Change this value to suit the speed of your computer - 1000 =1 second
    Send !1
    RunMacro = 0
  }
  if (NewPID = 0 and RunMacro = 0) {
    RunMacro = 1
  }
}

Then, press win+R and enter %appdata%

Navigate Microsoft->Windows and paste HideRibbon.ahk here, and create a
shortcut

Copy/Cut the shortcut and go in the same folder Start Menu
->Programs->Startup and paste here

This will automatically run the script when you start up your computer

Done! Now every time you open one note it will automagically show the
ribbons!

Remember to change the timing of the sleep to suit your computer's speed,
or it might fire off the hotkey too early.

This script resets itself after 5-15 seconds of closing onenote, so it
won't work if you close and immediately open onenote again.

  Hi Scott,

  You are not doing something wrong. The problem is that when ssh is being used like this the profile is not being read, hence that path is not being set to include /opt/csw/bin. If you set a full PATH in ~/.ssh/environment on sunray4 you should be fine.. E.g PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/hppd/bin:/opt/csw/bin:/usr/X/bin/
  (but the path should be the correct one for both solaris nd linux since it is being read when you logon to both sunray4 and e.g. hms1).

  However, we have a better alternativ: We have a "real" subversion server and here I've created a repository for you:
    https://svn.imm.dtu.dk/svn/scot
  Only you have access to it but we can grant access to other IMM users if needed. See https://itswiki.imm.dtu.dk/IT_Systems/IMM_provided/Subversion_server for more details.

  Best regards,
  Henning Chr.

        svn: warning: cannot set LC_CTYPE locale
        svn: warning: environment variable LANG is ENU
        svn: warning: please check that your locale name is correct

      (somehow, these error messages end up in the svn db files!  In the
      dir-prop-base file.  Corruption can be fixed by deleting the bad lines
      and correcting the byte count on the line above them (leads with 'V',
      count is the # of chars in the strings that remain + 1, probably for
      the newline?))

     [[http://armenianeagle.com/2008/03/18/svn-warning-cannot-set-lc_ctype-locale-solution/][ Somebody]] says this command belongs in .bashrc but is just svn cleanup
      sufficient to make the fix permanent?  Just to be sure, and to make
      sure Tortoise SVN could see it, I put it in a /windows/ environment
      variable.

      At this point emacs svn-examine (I mapped this to F2) still had the
      locale error message but svn checkin from emacs worked (by both C-c v v
      and the svn-examine window).

*********** overview

      From [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/662934][here]]:

      svn:externals will allow you to bring in files at a directory level. Like:

      Proj1\
        File1
        File2

      Proj2\
        File3
        File4

      Then in Proj2 you can svn:externals Proj1, and end up with:

      Proj2\
        Proj1\
          File1
          File2
        File3
        File4

      Your can also share individual files (in svn 1.6, see Wim Coenen comment)
      e.g.

      Proj2\
        File1 <- from Proj1
        File2 <- from Proj1
        File3
        File4

      But a commenter [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/3608453][here]] says that it's tricky to update individual files.

            "lib1 -r42 http://.../common/lib1/trunk/src"

          I imagine "-r42" could also reference a tag ([[http://stackoverflow.com/a/684994][it seems]]) but
          [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/683716/subversion-update-externals-to-a-date][don't try it with a date]].
*********** friendly explanation
    From [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/663283][here]]:

    We've used svn:externals pointing to shared code in practice for a few
    years now. We have had some interesting problems with it that you should
    probably consider before using it though. Here is the structure that we
    have:

    root
    +---common
    |   +---lib1
    |   |   \---trunk
    |   |       +---include
    |   |       \---src
    |   \---lib2
    |       \---trunk
    |           +---include
    |           \---src
    +---proj1
    |   \---trunk
    |       +---include
    |       |   \---common
    |       \---src
    |           \---common
    \---proj2
        \---trunk
            +---include
            |   \---common
            \---src
                \---common

    The common directories in both include and src in a project contain external definitions that pull in the common libraries:

    c:\dev> svn pget -v svn:externals proj1\trunk\src\common
    Properties on 'c:\dev\proj1\trunk\src\common':
      svn:externals : lib1 http://.../common/lib1/trunk/src
                      lib2 http://.../common/lib2/trunk/src

    The problem that we've run into is multifaceted but related to tagging and branching our source as the projects change throughout time. The externals definition that I showed above has a few pretty severe problems if you want to have reproducible builds:

        It refers to a dynamic target - trunk.
        It doesn't refer to an explicit revision.

    When you branch using svn copy, the externals are copied verbatim since
    they are really just properties attached to the object. Some of the other
    svn commands (commit, checkout, and export) actually interpret the
    properties. When you tag a project, you really want to preserve the state
    of the project for all time. This means that you have to "pin" the
    externals to a specific revision so you need to change the externals
    definition to explicit refer to the revision that you want (e.g., "lib1
    -r42 http://.../common/lib1/trunk/src"). This solves one facet of the
    problem.

    If you have to maintain multiple incompatible branches of the common code, then you have to specify which branch you want explicitly along with (possibly) the revision.

    Needless to say, this can be a bit of a headache. Luckily someone out there in Subversion land write the svncopy.pl script that automates some of this mess. We are still (and have been) struggling with some of the difficulties supporting this in a field deployed product with a bunch of shared code and a mandate of three different versions in the field at any time.

    If you do go down this route, then be sure to consider how you will maintain the linkages as the projects grow and change. We've found that a little bit of time thinking about a process will go a long way here.

******* 'svn copy' of a tree w/ different versions checked out in it

  From Redbook, [[http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.branchmerge.tags.html][here]]:

  Time to make a snapshot. Copying one URL to another won't work here. In
  this case, you want to make a snapshot of your exact working copy
  arrangement and store it in the repository. Luckily, svn copy actually has
  four different uses (which you can read about in Chapter 9, Subversion
  Complete Reference), including the ability to copy a working copy tree to
  the repository:

  $ ls
  my-working-copy/

  $ svn copy my-working-copy \
             http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/tags/mytag \
             -m "Tag my existing working copy state."

  Committed revision 940.

  Now there is a new directory in the repository, /calc/tags/mytag, which is
  an exact snapshot of your working copy—mixed revisions, URLs, local
  changes, and all.

***** spaces between table cells

Surprisingly hard.  [[http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_tab_border-spacing.asp][This]] is supposed to work but not for anki, at least.
[[http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/tables/index_famsupp_29.html][cellpadding and cellspacing]] works if want both vertical and horizontal
spacing.

My hack for horizontal spacing is to use border-left/right:

In this example, there are two row classes.  I couldn't get table-wide
inheritance to work for cell border spaces, as it did work for alternating
table rows in previous examples.

<STYLE TYPE="text/css">
  tr.generic td{background: transparent; font-size : 10 px; color: gray;
                border-right: 3pt solid transparent;
                border-left: 3pt solid transparent;}
  tr.hilgt td{background: GhostWhite; font-size : 10 px; color: black;
              border-right: 3pt solid GhostWhite;
              border-left: 3pt solid GhostWhite;}
</STYLE>

<table align="center">
  <tr class="hilgt"><td>ich</td><td>bin</td></tr>
  <tr class="generic"><td>du</td><td>bist</td></tr>
</table>

    The youtube video suggested downloading @ 10X normal speed but I

    1. edit pathdef.m
    2. add the folders you want matlab to search in
    3. Save (when it says you can't save there, select to save to somewhere else)
    4. save the new pathdef.m to some user-specific directory (for me ~/.matlab)
    5. set userpath to that directory with 'userpath' command
    6. save path again so that the userpath def'n gets saved (use the GUI,
       don't edit pathdef.m and save it b/c this doesn't work, for some

          this [[http://www.mathworks.de/support/solutions/en/data/1-1BSAH/index.html?product%3DML&solution%3D1-1BSAH][workaround]]:

          plotmystuff(); % uses subplots 4-12 and leaves 1-3 empty
          legend1 = legend(gca,'show');
          % set the legend where I really want it.
          set(legend1,'Position',[a b c d]);

          I typically run it one time and then use "File->Generate Code" to
          give me the actual coordinates I was satisfied with.

********* top subplot gets extra lines, legend and gets shrunk

          *[[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/6881-legend-in-subplot][Example]]*

Subject: Re: Matlab won't recognize my 64 bit SVN
To: scott.otterson@iwes.fraunhofer.de

Dear Scott Otterson,

I am writing in reference to your Service Request # 1-FCNXSZ regarding 'Matlab won't recognize my 64 bit SVN'.

As is noted in our documentation:

http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/matlab_env/brbmdzd.html

MATLAB on Windows platform only supports source control systems that conform to the Microsoft Common Source Control standard, Version 1.1. TortoiseSVN is does not conform to this standard. However, third party SCC compatible wrappers for SVN do exist; visit the following page on our website for some suggestions:

http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-3TABI8/?solution=1-3TABI8

Please note that for 64-bit MATLAB, you will need a 64-bit compatible wrapper.

Please preserve the THREAD ID below in any further correspondence on this query. This will allow our systems to automatically assign your reply to the appropriate Service Request. If you have a new technical support question, please submit a new request here:

******* The steps I took, which didn't work

SO: Included hacks so SVN works w/ 64 bit Matlab.

Required for the matlab hack, here:

  http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11596-subversion-interface-for-matlab

Steps:

1. Replaced the verctrl.m and verctrl.m and verctrl.mexw64 with code from
here:

http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11596-subversion-interface-for-matlab

2. Hacked the hack (fixed svn path), put here:

   ~/lib/matlab/contrib/

Tried to install MS compilers to could compile but it failed:

3. installed the two compiler packages, as instructed here:

   http://www.mathworks.de/support/compilers/R2011a/win64.html

   (I also tried to install the SQL stuff, as long as I was at it.  But it
   didn't work, for some unexplained reason.)

4. compiled in matlab:

   mex customverctrl.m

   But I got this error:

   >> mex customverctrl.m
   customverctrl.m : fatal error LNK1107: invalid or corrupt file: cannot read at 0x1415

     C:\PROGRA~1\MATLAB\R2011A\BIN\MEX.PL: Error: Link of 'customverctrl.mexw64' failed.

    =??? Error using ==> mex at 208
    Unable to complete successfully.

5. so I just copied customverctrl.m over the top of the old .m and moved
   the old compiled version out of the way.

BUT this still wouldn't allow me to use SVN -- there was no "custom"
version control option like there was supposed to be.

So, I gave up and reverted to the original files.

    _My comments_

    See JanSimon's comment in this [[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/3314-hash-function-for-matlab-struct][thread]].  Commenter Francois Rongère uses
    it exactly the same way as I used hashes in RunRouter.  *Warning*: in the
    comments it says something disturbing:

      The shown function replies the same hash for "struct('a', 1, 'b', 2)"
      and "struct('a', 2, 'b', 1)"! Using BITXOR does not consider the
      order of data.

    I didn't check to see if this was true for the code that was fially
    submitted on matlab file exchange.

    *Also*: how does it handle the case when different stucts have different
    members?  Does it crash or does it make different hashes for them?

    From: [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33760043/assign-new-matrix-values-based-on-row-and-column-index-vectors][Matlab - assign new matrix values based on row and column index]]

    *Conclusion:* best way is usually the clunky: ~sub2ind(size(A),rows,cols)~

    Have: 
    A = zeros(3, 2)

    Want:
    A =

    1 0
    0 1
    1 0

    Indices:
    rows = [1 2 3];
    cols = [1 2 1];

    _Doesn't work_

    A(rows,cols) = 1;

    _Works_

    *1. loop* (slow)

      for i = 1:length(rows)
        A(rows(i), cols(i)) = 1;
      end

    *2. sub2ind (faster)*

      A(sub2ind(size(A),rows,cols))=1
      % also
      b = [1,2,3];
      A(sub2ind(size(A),rows,cols))=b

    *3. index math ("20% faster" than sub2ind)*

      idx = rows + (cols - 1) * size(A, 1);
      A(idx) = 1 % or b

      /For N-dim arrays see [[http://tipstrickshowtos.blogspot.de/2010/02/fast-replacement-for-sub2ind.html][here]]/

    *4. sparse* (is this fast or convenient?)

Note: You can use the col2rgb( ) function to get the rbg values for R
colors. For example, col2rgb("darkgreen") yeilds r=0, g=100, b=0. Then add
the alpha transparency level as the 4th number in the color vector. A value
of zero means fully transparent. See help(rgb) for more information.

***** alpha channel plotting: [[http://www.rosuda.org/iplots/][iPlots]]
***** subplot()
******* splitplot() in ifultools package. *The best?*

        /More like matlab's supblot, allows you to go backwards/,
        /unlike R.utils subplot()/

library(ifultools)
## establish a 2x2 plot grid and select the first
## for plotting
old.plt <- splitplot(2,2,1)
## plot the data
for (i in seq(4)){
if (i > 1)
splitplot(2,2,i)
plot(rnorm(100)*i)
mtext(paste("i=", i, sep=""), side=3, line=0.5)
}
## return the original plot state of plt in par
par(old.plt)

******* subplots() in [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R.utils/R.utils.pdf][R.utils]].  From help(subplots):

      library(R.utils)

      l=subplots(nrow=2, ncol=3)
      # layout.show(length(l)) # see where they are

      # plots are loaded by ordered plot commands
      plot(1:10,cos(1:10))
      plot(1:10,sin(1:10))
      plot(1:10,log(1:10))
      plot(1:10,cos(1:10)*log(1:10))
      plot(1:10,exp(1:10))
      plot(1:10,tanh(1:10))

      # one more plot than subplot dim product: starts over, erasing prev. plots
      plot(1:10,tanh(1:10))

      # can also go in column order:
      l=subplots(nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=FALSE)
      layout.show(length(l))

******* R built-ins:  layout, split.screen, par

*par(mfrow=), par(mfcol=), par(mfg=)* are simplist

Example:
par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # makes a 2 column plot pane
(every plot command swaps plot frames, so is annoying)

*From Hiebeler's [[http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Hiebeler-matlabR.pdf][Matlab R/R Reference]]*

There are several ways to do this, e.g.
using layout or split.screen, al-
though they aren’t quite as friendly
as Matlab ’s. E.g. if you let A =
1 1 2
1 1 3
4 5 6
, then

*layout(A)* will divide the figure into 6 sub-figures: you can imagine the
figure divide into a 3 × 3 matrix of smaller blocks; sub- figure 1 will
take up the upper-left 2×2 portion, and sub-figures 2–6 will take up
smaller portions, according to the positions of those numbers in the
matrix A. Consecutive plotting com- mands will draw into successive sub-
figures; there doesn’t seem to be a way to explicitly specify which
sub-figure to draw into next.

To use *split.screen*, you can do e.g. split.screen(c(2,1)) to split into a 2
× 1 matrix of sub- figures (numbered 1 and 2). Then split.screen(c(1,3),2)
splits sub- figure 2 into a 1× 3 matrix of smaller sub-figures (numbered 3,
4, and 5).  screen(4) will then select sub-figure number 4, and subsequent
plotting commands will draw into it.

A third way to accomplish this is via the commands *par(mfrow=)* or
*par(mfcol=)* to split the figure window, and *par(mfg=)* to select which
sub-figure to draw into.  Note that the above methods are all incompatible
with each other.

***** zoom plot gui's
******* [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Graphics.html][advice]] on R graphics (see interactive graphics section)
******* [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoom/][zoom]]: works on standard R graphs, simple mouse clicks, keyboard, SLOW

Keyboard:
Left/Right (h/l):           move left/right
Up/Down (k/j)   :              move up/down
+ or i / - or o :               zoom in/out

******* [[http://bm2.genes.nig.ac.jp/RGM2/R_current/library/Hmisc/man/Overview.html][Hmisc]]

        Has a zoom function (for any graphic) but I can't figure it out
        except:

        zoom(fun=plot,x=1:100,y=cos(1:100),type='l')

        click mouse-3 to stop zooming.  zoom() is and "internal function" not
        supposed to be called by user so I think I'm missing something.

*** Installing libraries (packages)

      install.packages("dtw");

    help recommends that you first run

      update.packages()

***** Setup
      <<R packages setup>>
******* proxy (needed at IWES)

        So that R uses whatever proxy is used by IE.  Then will work in and
        out of IWES, if IE has the proxy set correctly.

        In windows, as advised [[http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/rw-FAQ.html#The-Internet-download-functions-fail_002e][here]], edit the R desktop shortcut so that
        the target has /--internet2/ at the end, and outside of the quotes
        e.g.

        "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.13.1\bin\x64\Rgui.exe" --internet2

******* Undoing proxy

        When off of IWES net, I couldn't install packages b/c R thought I
        was still on a proxy, even though the IE proxy was turned off. This
        was because I had set the environment variable http_proxy, and
        this overrode the IE setting.

        To fix, delete the environment variable:

        HTTP_proxy 10.13.13.5:3128

        (be sure to set again for wget or whatever it was that I originally
         had it set for)

******* R libs environment variables

      Both R_LIBS_USER and R_LIBS_SITE [[http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html][can specify multiple]] library paths,
      separated by colons (semicolons on Windows).

      *HOWEVER* it seems that R_LIBS_USER can be only one path (it's the
      folder where your own packages are installed when you do
      install.packages() and the system folders are unreadable (or just
      when R_LIBS_USER is present?).

      Can specify an R [[http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/base/.libPaths][version number and machine architecture]] in these
      library paths. As suggested [[http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/README][here]], put something like this:

        R_LIBS_USER="~/lib/R/%p/%v;~/lib/R" (Unix)

      OR

        R_LIBS_USER="~/lib/R/%p/%v:~/lib/R" (Unix)

      into

        ~/.Renviron

      then make the directory pointed by R_LIBS_USER, e.g.

        mkdir ~/lib/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/2.12

      _For windows_, an environment variable works (and _maybe does in Linux?_)
      in the control panel interface:

        R_LIBS_USER %HOME%\lib\R\%p\%v

      Can see what dir to make by starting R w/ the new ~/.Renviron or new
      R_LIBS_USER env var, and then, within R, running:

        Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")

      (R can be pointing to not the version you want but you can fix this
      by [[controlling which R version is run]]

      After the mkdir, restart R so that it will notice the new directory.

      Then packages can be installed inside of R, for example

        install.packages("dtw");

      With the above, I'll need to install every package for each
      architecture, while running R on each machine type e.g. Solaris AND
      Linux on DTU machines.

      install.packages() installs in the first item of the colon separated
      list in R_LIBS_USER; cran stuff will go there automatically.  The
      ~/lib/R entry is for my own packages, that don't have compiled stuff in
      them, and are thus, not architecture (and hopefully, R) dependent.

      *R_LIBS Shell Environment Variable*

      [[http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig/docs/Installing_Zelig2.html][Supposedly]], you can also use the "R_LIBS" shell environment variable to
      set the library path, eg.

        export R_LIBS="$HOME/Library/R/library"

      You can see it being used in the R code [[http://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/utils/R/packages2.R][here]] but I think this is
      windows.  Also, I can't tell if this code is called if the *--no-environ*
      is invoked when R is called (a problem for the unmodified Rsge package
      (see below).

***** controlling which R version is run
      <<controlling which R version is run>>

      from [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12574738/how-can-i-specify-the-r-version-opened-by-ess-session-in-emacs][here]]:

      Can also customize: Inferior R Program Name, but then you have to
      point to a specific path (I did this because I couldn't figure out a
      more automatic, surefire method.  But this will break as soon as I
      upgrade R.  Right now it's pointed to:

      C:/Program Files/R/R-3.0.2/bin/x64/Rterm.exe

******* fixing the "no package" problem for packages I've installed in my home dir

        _The solution_ is to edit the bash script that calls qsub.
        In [[file:~/lib/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/2.11/Rsge/RunSgeJob::fi][Rsge/RunSgeJob]], change the line:
                "$RSGE_R" --vanilla <<EOF
        to:
                "$RSGE_R" --no-save --no-restore --no-site-file <<EOF

        _The error_:

          Your job-array 132525.1-1:1 ("RunSgeJob") has been submitted Job 132525 exited with exit code 0.
          All jobs completed
          Error in library(package.name, character.only = TRUE) :
          there is no package called 'plyr'

        I think this is happening in the bash script called by qsub
        ([[file:~/Desktop/Rsge/inst/RunSgeJob::library%20package%20name%20character%20only%20TRUE][~/Desktop/Rsge/inst/RunSgeJob]]), at the point where it (inside an R
        script) does this:

           library(package.name, character.only=TRUE)

        package.name comes from the list of packages in the sge.parLapply()
        call e.g.

          nMiss = sge.parLapply(c(1),errFrcstTrn,D,ttSpec,njobs=1,join.method=c,
           function.savelist=c('getFrcstErrs','frcstEval','errFrcstTrn','errFrcstTst'),
           packages=c('Amelia','playwith','care','plyr'),
           global.savelist='myLibPathsGlobal',debug=TRUE)

        The actual qsub call occurs in [[file:~/Desktop/Rsge/R/sge.parApply.R::result%20system%20paste%20qsub%20qsub%20user%20opt%20qsub%20options%20qsub%20blocking%20length%20rowSet%20script%202%201%20sep%20intern%20TRUE][~/Desktop/Rsge/R/sge.parApply.R]]
        (sge.parParApply function).  It looks something like this:

        "qsub -S /bin/bash -cwd -sync y -t 1-2 /home/scot/lib/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/2.11/Rsge/RunSgeJob /home/scot/proj/dongSpatTemp/Rsge_data7c83e458 2>&1"

        I did this by calling getOption() like is done [[file:~/Desktop/Rsge/R/sge.parApply.R::qsub%20getOption%20sge%20qsub][here]] and making up a
        fake value for the variable "rowSet"

        _The proximal cause_ is that R doesn't seem to know about any packages other
        than what are in the default path; it's missing my local library in
        [[file:~/lib/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/2.11]].  In the
        library(package.name...) function, I can only put a name in the
        packages list (not a package path): this is why it can't find my
        local packages.

        /How to force R to look at my library?/  Ideally, I could just set an
        environment variable on the qsub line, telling R to look at my
        local library, by setting the [[file:~/Desktop/Rsge/R/sge.parApply.R::qsub%20user%20opt%20getOption%20sge%20user%20options][sge.user.options]] option.
        /But this won't work/ becuase of the --vanilla thing mentioned below...

        _The primary cause_ is that R is started with --vanilla in RunSgeJob
        [[file:~/Desktop/Rsge/inst/RunSgeJob::RSGE_R%20vanilla%20EOF][here]].  This causes R to run with

          --no-save --no-restore --no-site-file --no-init-file --no-environ

        and --no-init-file prevents R from paying attention to my
        ~/.Renviron file (from the "R --help").  I tried editing RunSgeJob,
        replacing the line:

        "$RSGE_R" --vanilla <<EOF

        with

        "$RSGE_R" --no-save --no-restore --no-site-file --no-environ <<EOF

        but still got the error.  Then I tried

        "$RSGE_R" --no-save <<EOF

        and it worked! (must have --no-save if not --vanilla or something else I forgot)
        and got much further, but it died on package ciaroDevice, probably
        from the playwith package.

        failed:
        "$RSGE_R" --no-save --no-restore --no-site-file --no-environ <<EOF

        passed:
        "$RSGE_R" --no-save --no-restore --no-site-file <<EOF

        /use this since it's the most like the original --vanilla/

        _The conclusion_: it seems like the --no-environ flag caused the failure

*** sorting
***** [[http://www.tek-tips.com/faqs.cfm?fid%3D5095][custom sort routines]] oddities
 Custom sort subroutines are not normal subroutines! They have some special
 rules:

(1)  Sort subroutines do not accept arguments like normal
     subroutines.

(2)  Two values being compared are automatically
     passed-by-reference into the sort subroutine as
     $a and $b. Don't try to change their values or
     override them.

(3)  A sort subroutine can only return one of three
     values: -1 , 0,  or 1.

(4)  Don't call sort routines recursively. The compiler
     will be angry with you.

***** [[http://www.misc-perl-info.com/perl-sort.html][sorting arrays within another array]]

# define an array of arrays
my @AOA = ([25, 49, 33, 200], [145, 32], [11, 121, 78]);

# sort and print the @AOA array
foreach my $item1 (@AOA){
  foreach my $item2 (sort {$b <=> $a} @{$item1}){
    print "$item2 ";

        use utf8;
        my $name = "おおつか　たろう"; # a convention to make utf-8 work?

***** [[http://docs.activestate.com/activeperl/5.8/lib/pods/perlunicode.html#forcing_unicode_in_perl__or_unforcing_unicode_in_perl_][force string to be utf-8]] w/ function

Forcing Unicode in Perl (Or Unforcing Unicode in Perl)

Sometimes (see When Unicode Does Not Happen) there are situations where you
simply need to force Perl to believe that a byte string is UTF-8, or vice
versa. The low-level calls utf8::upgrade($bytestring) and
utf8::downgrade($utf8string) are the answers.

Do not use them without careful thought, though: Perl may easily get very
confused, angry, or even crash, if you suddenly change the 'nature' of
scalar like that. Especially careful you have to be if you use the
utf8::upgrade(): any random byte string is not valid UTF-8.

* Python
*** <<Windows Python>>
    Needed at least for org-mode ox-clip

***** <<Install Windows Python with Anaconda>>
      Mostly following this [[https://machinelearningmastery.com/setup-python-environment-machine-learning-deep-learning-anaconda/][TensorFlow install advice]]

      The idea was to install everything with anaconda to avoid the "not compiled with AVX" warnings I got when I [[Install python with Chocolatey]]) but I still get them.

      _Download Anaconda_ from [[https://www.anaconda.com/download/][here]] 
      I picked 64 bit v3.6 ([[https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows][v3.6 is OK for TensorFlow]] (Oct 21, 2017))
        
      _Install Anaconda_: 
        o click the buttons
        o _install for "Just for Me",_ not for "All Users."  Otherwise, to
          install packages, etc. [[https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/3652][you'll need either]] 1) admin priveleges 2) to
          change priveleges on the c:/ProgramData/Anaconda3 or 3) only use
          Anaconda Navigator 4) clone your anaconda environment.  
          All these are messy.

          So I installed "Just for Me."  In this case, python.exe is installed in %USERPROFILE%\Anaconda3 and %USERPROFILE%\Anaconda3\Scripts (C:\Users\scotto\Anaconda3 and C:\Users\scotto\Anaconda3\Scripts)

      _Start and Update Anaconda_ (from "anaconda prompt" on start menu)
        
        conda update conda
        conda update anaconda

        o [[https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!topic/anaconda/KnZQBU8kd9Q][anaconda prompt is recommended]]
        o could also add python stuff to windows PATH (not recommended)

      _Add C:\Users\scotto\Anaconda3\Scripts to my Windows PATH_
      (not recommended (see above, but this allows emacs elpy to work)

      Do [[My SP4 TensorFlow install]]

      restart anaconda console
      pip install kiras (this did not work...)

******* <<Uninstall Anaconda>>
        It didn't show up in the Windows 10 program list nor was there an install program found on the Windows start menu.  However, you can [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29337928/how-to-remove-anaconda-from-windows-completely][uninstall it by running this program]]:

          Uninstall-Anaconda.exe

        which is in the anaconda root dir: either c:/ProgramData/Anaconda3 or C:\Users\username\Anaconda3 (when installed "just for me").

***** <<Install python with Chocolatey>>

    Problem with this was that I kept getting messages about this TensorFlow not being built for optimal performance on my SP4, was not compiled for some instruction set.   It did not sound like TensorFlow was going to fix this ever (some TF blog somewhere) so I decided to [[Install Windows Python with Anaconda]] instead, which seems to be recommended by a lot of people.

    I installed using [[Chocolatey]], which gave me Python 3.6.3, which [[https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows][seems to be OK for TensorFlow]] (Oct 21, 2017).  Following instructions I did: 

      choco install -y python

    Add to path (similar [[https://ianchanning.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/jupyter-on-windows-with-chocolatey/][was suggested]] for when install Jupyter):

      _Update scikit-learn Library_ (in anaconda prompt)
         conda update scikit-learn

      _Install Deep Learning Libraries_ (from here, on my SP4, no GPU/CUDA)

      conda create -n tensorflow python=3.6

      python
      import tensorflow as tf                              /just a test, in anaconda/
      hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
      sess = tf.Session()

***** <<My SP4 TensorFlow install>>

      o create tensorflow environment (necessary?  [[https://machinelearningmastery.com/setup-python-environment-machine-learning-deep-learning-anaconda/][This guy doesn't do it]])

        conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5 

      o Activate the conda environment by issuing the following command:

          activate tensorflow

      o Install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow (SP4 doesn't hare right GPU)

          pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow 

        (I installed the CPU only TF b/c I had problems with CUDA even on my

      in a copy of the environment. In other words, it runs

        perl -w

      in a new shell. And since this new environment will just look up perl
      in the path, this gets around the requirement that perl gets
      specified with a full path. It exchanges it for the requirement that
      /usr/bin/env exists, of course, but that usually does. Except that on
      some systems it doesn’t, so this workaround is not perfect

***** [[https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using][setup]] on Windows 7

  Go the Control Panel.

  Click Network and Internet, then Network and Sharing Center, and click
  Change adapter settings.

  Select the connection for which you want to configure Google Public
  DNS. For example:

  To change the settings for an Ethernet connection, right-click Local Area
  Connection, and click Properties.

  To change the settings for a wireless connection, right-click Wireless
  Network Connection, and click Properties.

  If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the
  password or provide confirmation.

  Select the Networking tab. Under This connection uses the following items,
  select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version
  6 (TCP/IPv6) and then click Properties.

  Click Advanced and select the DNS tab. If there are any DNS server IP
  addresses listed there, write them down for future reference, and remove
  them from this window.

  Click OK.

  Select Use the following DNS server addresses. If there are any IP
  addresses listed in the Preferred DNS server or Alternate DNS server, write
  them down for future reference.

  Replace those addresses with the IP addresses of the Google DNS servers:
  For IPv4: 8.8.8.8 and/or 8.8.4.4.
  For IPv6: 2001:4860:4860::8888 and/or 2001:4860:4860::8844

  Restart the connection you selected in step 3.

  Test that your setup is working correctly; see Testing your new settings
  below.

  Repeat the procedure for additional network connections you want to change.

    Main idea is that similar link names combined into a single line by autolayout program, which then goes to the individual concepts.  Makes the drawing easier to read, at least if you don't have too many different link names.

    Also has sub diagrams, sub-sub diagrams, etc.

      A powerful general reference framework, like a super-jabref.  Did interesting topic clustering (some good, some not meaningful) but I didn't like the way it ate my pdfs and insisted on editing them within the tool (no Drawboard ink, etc.).

***** Bibliograph visualizaton using [[Gephi]]

******* [[https://abhishekkathuria.wordpress.com/2014/07/01/visualizing-your-co-author-network/][Gephi & Sci2 Co-author graph]]
        <<Gephi & Sci2 co-author graph>>

        _This wasn't useful._  Took forever and the network wasn't topic-based but co-author based.  And then, you couldn't see authors or paper titles on the graph when you cliked on them.

        1. Start [[https://sci2.cns.iu.edu/user/index.php][Sci2]] and [[Gephi]]
        2. Load the references into Sci2 using the File->Load option.   /This required a lot of cleanup in my energy.bib/
        3. Select the file, click on Data Preparation-> Extract Co-author Network. Select the correct format.
        4. Select the +Author Information+ +file+ /extracted co-author-network icon/ on right and select Visualization->Networks->Gephi
        5. Gephi should open up. Create a new undirected graph. You can use the Gephi WYSIWYG editor to edit the graph, add labels, change colors, increase the size of the nodes and edges based on number of authored and co-authored papers respectively.


******* /Likely obsolete/: [[http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/43066/tool-to-visualize-connections-between-bibtex-entries][Gephi & NWB]]
        Best answer: <<Gephi & NWP bibliography visualization>>

        _ACTUALLY_, NWB is unmaintained and stuff doesn't work.  But somehow, it seems like it's necessary to download the edu.iu.nwb.converter.prefusebibtex plugin from [[http://nwb.cns.iu.edu/svn/nwb/trunk/plugins/converter/][here]] and drop it in some plugin directory in the unzipped NWP folder tree.  NWB may have been superceeded by Sci2 ([[Gephi & Sci2 co-author graph]])

        This is possible with the following two tools:

        Network Workbench (NWB) - http://nwb.cns.iu.edu/
        [[Gephi]] - https://gephi.org/

        First, import your .bib file into NWB, then extract the authors, pubs, or whatever through the Scientometrics menu. Finally, right-click on the graph this creates and export it as GraphML.

        Now open Gephi and import the GraphML file you just created. With Gephi, you can visualize the interrelationships between authors and citations.

* Kindle
*** Exporting Kindle files to pdf
    See partial overview [[http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-convert-kindle-to-pdf/#!LpAlh][here]].

    There are several options but I explored EPUB and Calibre.  

    *Calibre*
    It's possible that Calibre could produce prettier pdf's than EPUB but I couldn't figure out how to control the font size in the "Heuristic" mode, which would seem to be the setting that would produce the best results.  It also did wierd stuff, like occasional half-blank pages.

    *EPUB*
    On Koenkers05 quantile regression book, it did well so that's what I'm going with.  Unfortunately, last year (2016) I'd converted the copy I'm not annotating either with an old copy of EPUB or with bad settings.  Anyway, EPUB is pretty good now.

    *EPUB instructions*

    o *Get a DRM-friendly Kindle Reader*: It's an old desktop Kindle Reader
      [[https://www.anicesoft.com/parse-kindle-books/][Instructions]] -- be sure to follow them carefully.

    o *Download books to be converted*.  They'll be (*.amz) files in
    
      D:\Users\sotterson\Documents\My Kindle Content

      (see Kindle Reader tools->options->content in case this changes)

    o *Remove DRM*: download and run [[https://www.epubconverter.com/DownloadSoftware/download.aspx?type=ebook-removal-win][EpubSoft Ultimate DRM Remover]]

    o *Convert de-DRMed Kindle file to pdf*: download/use [[https://www.epubconverter.com/DownloadSoftware/download.aspx?type=epub-converter-win][Anicesoft EPUB Converter]]

      Settings (under output format, or something like that, icon) 
      o margins: L/R=60 and T/B=75 seemed OK
      o 16pt font matched IEEE paper size the best (IEEE is OK on my SP4)

      Note: I didn't use the online [[https://www.epubconverter.com/kindle-to-pdf-converter/][Epub Converter Kindle To PDF Converter]] because it didn't work immediately, probably [[https://www.epubconverter.com/failed.html][because of the .amz file DRM]], which I don't get b/c I thought I had de-DRM'ed that already...

*** DTU
    How to set up file share between solaris and 2 laptops

***** same dir stuct everywhere, rooted at ~
******* what is homedir (~) on DTU laptop?
******* currently, it's rooted off my desktop.  Good enough?
***** move dropbox to same place too?
******* under homedir, which doesn't exist on DTU laptop
***** on DTU laptop, made symbolic link to dropbox DTU directory:
      open cmd.exe as administrator
      mklink /D DTU "c:/Users/scot/Desktop/scotto/My Dropbox/DTU"

      I did similar on my own laptop

***** need to have separate emacs compiles 
      solaris, 32bit, 64bit
***** version control on .emacs
******* moved them to c:/Data/scotto_vista/Desktop/My Dropbox/config
******* symlinked to EMACSHOME

      open cmd.exe as administrator

      ;; on X60T
      e:
      cd scotto
      mklink .emacs "c:/Data/scotto_vista/Desktop/My Dropbox/config/.emacs"
      mklink .emacs.gnu "c:/Data/scotto_vista/Desktop/My Dropbox/config/.emacs.gnu"
      mklink .emacs.xemacs "c:/Data/scotto_vista/Desktop/My Dropbox/config/.emacs.xemacs"
    
***** drop source in anywhere; shows up everywhere
******* rsync to DTU but would have to rsync back every time
******* drop box
********* OK for laptops
******* DTU rsync
********* can get everything on everything
********* not as convenient as dropbox
******* version control
********* could handle .emacs, etc.
********* but not papers, unless check them in too
******* a mix of dropping rsyncing and VC: error-prone

********* DONE xmarks @ DTU Sun
********* DONE firefox (laptops)
********* DONE chrome (laptops)
******* firefox can share pwd's but I didn't enable it
******* chrome can sync stuff too but I didn't enable it to avoid xmarks confusion
***** DONE want to share onenote files
******* DropBox folder works
******* *BUT* must make sure to close onenote on computers to avoid concurrency probs
